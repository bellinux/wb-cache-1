She agrees and shows him the varying degrees of child abuse she encounters {{in the course of}} her job. Wanting to understand the factors behind child abuse, Bruce, as Batman, breaks into Hellgate Prison and talks with an informant who points him to a child pornography and prostitution ring. Bruce's butler Alfred Pennyworth reveals that Bruce's mother, Martha Wayne, had been secretly investigating a similar child prostitution ring, and that the sex traffickers ordered the murders of Bruce's parents in order to silence her.|$|E
5|$|However, {{given the}} length of time the abuse has been going on, Connie is afraid no one will believe her. The {{assistant}} district attorney assigned to the case, Rhonda Preshutski (Christine Dunford) agrees, believing the case to be weak. <b>Child</b> <b>Protective</b> Services cannot remove Sara from the household until Connie undergoes a psychiatric evaluation, although Black and police lieutenant Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) investigate the Bangs home to check up on the girl. The father, Joe Bangs (Paul Dooley), chases them off as his wife watches detachedly. Bangs wields a degree of political clout in the community, and pressures the district attorney's office to drop the case. Preshutski is furious with Black over the matter, until it is discovered from Connie's medical exams that Sara is not her sister, but her daughter.|$|E

25|$|Research on 'protective factors', {{which are}} {{characteristics}} of children or situations that particularly help {{children in the}} context of risk has helped developmental scientists to understand what matters most for resilient children. Two of these that have emerged repeatedly in studies of resilient children are good cognitive functioning (like cognitive self-regulation and IQ) and positive relationships (especially with competent adults, like parents). <b>Children</b> who have <b>protective</b> factors in their lives tend to do better in some risky contexts when compared to <b>children</b> without <b>protective</b> factors in the same contexts. However, this is not a justification to expose any child to risk. Children do better when not exposed to high levels of risk or adversity.|$|R

500|$|The entire storyline that {{centered}} around Quinn, Puck and Shelby was roundly criticized by reviewers.

Bell was one of several who thought it was highly implausible that <b>Child</b> <b>Protective</b> Services would be backed up, much less for two weeks, given the gravity of Quinn's accusations. Hankinson wondered why they [...] "made Quinn a total sociopath" [...] who went from [...] "dancing on desks" [...] to [...] "framing someone for child endangerment" [...] with great ease; VanDerWerff was also critical of these actions, and called Quinn's sabotage of Shelby's apartment [...] "a move that takes a potentially good character, played by a fine actress, and just guts her". Kevin P. Sullivan of MTV had a different view, and wrote that the [...] "storyline stuck out throughout the episode as the most interesting". He also noted that it was [...] "cathartic and definitely nice to see a sweeter Puck balance out the earnest craziness of Quinn". The final scene of the episode, when Puck kissed Shelby, was characterized as [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "super awkward" [...] by Bell, as either [...] "super creepy" [...] or [...] "romantic" [...] by BuddyTV John Kubicek, as [...] "groan-inducing" [...] in the [...] "You're actually going to go there?"

40|$|Background Typhoid fever is {{endemic to}} Indonesia, {{with an annual}} {{incidence}} of 13 / 10, 000 people. Vaccination {{has been shown to}} be an effective method to prevent typhoid fever. Of several vaccine types, the polysaccharide Vi vaccine is the most commonly used typhoid vaccine in developing countries. Results of previous studies remain inconclusive on the necessity of revaccination every 3 years. Objective To compare the mean serum anrioody titers of anti-S. typhi Vi IgG and the proportion of <b>children</b> with <b>protective</b> antibody levels between children with and without typhoid Vi vaccination. Methods We conducted a cross-secrional study at Tuminring District, 11 anado from June to September 2012. Data was analyzed using independent T-test and Fisher's test. Serum anti-S. typhi Vi IgG levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Results Seventy-six subjects were divided into two groups: 38 children who had received the typhoid Vi vaccination more than 3 years prior to this study and 38 children who never had typhoid vaccinations as a control group. No statistically significant difference in age and gender was found between the two groups. The mean serum anti-Vi IgG level was 0. 55 ug/mL (SD 0. 58; 95 %CI 0. 36 to 0. 74) in the vaccinated group, significantly higher than that of the control group [0. 31 ug/mL (SD 0. 12); 950 /Â£ 1 0. 17 to 0. 44; P 0. 0381. The proportion of <b>children</b> with <b>protective</b> antiNi antioody level was higher in the vaccinated group (23. 7 %) than in the control group Â (10. 5 %), howevet; this difference was not statistically significant (P= 0. 128). Conclusion The mean serum anti-S. typhi Vi IgG antibody level in children who had been vaccinated more than 3 years prior to the study is higher than in children who had never received typhoid vaccinations. Nevertheless, the mean antibody titers are generally non-protective in ooth groups. Also, the proportion of <b>children</b> with <b>protective</b> antibody levels is not significantly different between the two groups...|$|R
40|$|Resilience is a {{universal}} capacity that allows a child to prevent, minimize, or overcome the damaging effects of adversity. The construct of resiliency, the combination of protective factors that result in resilience, was addressed by the International Resilience Project (IRP), which set out to explore what parents, caregivers, teachers or children can do that seems to promote resilience in <b>children.</b> <b>Protective</b> factors noted include the dispositional attributes of the individual, family attributes, and school and community environment. The IRP determined that children overcome adversity by drawing on three sources of resilience, labeled "I have, " "I am, " "I can. " To test these resilience features, 39 children in a Singapore primary school were given an adapted version of the Child's Perception of Resilience Checklist, as used in the IRP. The study determined {{that it is possible}} to draw a common set of resilience factors in a particular cultural setting to promote resilience in children, and that a number of strong resilience factors were shown; however, while the children do use resilience-promoting behaviors, these depend largely on the individual situation. The results reinforce the role of family and school as protective factors for the developing child.
