5|$|<b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> {{had participated}} in three {{previous}} Summer Olympics, between its debut in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. At their debut, the country sent three athletes to the games, all in athletics. The most number of <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> athletes participating in a summer games, is three in 1996, 2004 and 2012. No <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> athlete has ever progressed {{out of the first}} round. Two athletes from <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> were selected to compete in the 2008 games; Nelson Cruz in the men's marathon and Wania Monteiro in the women's all-round gymnastics.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Fran {{was one of}} {{the deadliest}} {{tropical}} cyclones in the history of <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde.</b> The sixth named storm and eleventh tropical cyclone of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season, Fran developed from a tropical wave near <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> on September15. It began as a tropical depression and gradually strengthened while tracking westward, remaining south of the <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> archipelago. Late on September16, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fran, shortly before brushing <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde,</b> and then moving further out to sea. The storm approached hurricane status on September17 and September18, though it eventually weakened. Beginning on September19, Fran encountered strong wind shear, which contributed to further weakening. By September20, Fran dissipated well east of the Lesser Antilles.|$|E

5|$|On September 21, a {{tropical}} wave – a trough of relatively low atmospheric pressure – began moving slowly westward {{from the west}} coast of Africa, passing near the <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> islands on September 23. Though the wave was disorganized, a low-level circulation developed on September 24 a few hundred miles to the southwest of <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde.</b> Steady organization ensued, including the development of convection into curved bands around the system. Though it lacked a well-defined center, the system organized enough to be classified Tropical Depression Sixteen on September 25 while located about 920mi (1,480km) west-southwest of the <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> Islands.|$|E

5|$|On October10, 1984, the Government of <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> {{appealed for}} {{international}} assistance. Emergency relief aid requested included: two-month {{supply of food}} for 1,124families, 1,064mattresses, 532kerosene stoves, 2,128sets of dinner ware, 2,128mugs, 1,064cooking pots and pans, 532water buckets, 2,128sheets, 1,064blankets, 2,660articles of clothing, and building materials for repair of the 1,094houses. In January1985, the government of <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> announced that they had made significant progress with relief assistance. However, repairs to roads, infrastructure, and crops were still required. Five organizations contributed cash, including the National Solidarity Movement, the <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> Red Cross, Chinese Red Cross, Oxfam Novib, and Oxfam of the United Kingdom; donations collectively totaled to $172,221 (1984USD). France, Finland, the Soviet Union, and the United States supplied 4000tons of cereals, $79,000 (1984USD) to the Red Cross, $250,000 (1984USD) for home repairs, 32packages of medicines, and 17packages of blankets.|$|E

5|$|The storm {{developed}} {{west of the}} <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> islands on August 21. It was {{upgraded to}} a tropical storm on August 22 and to a hurricane on August 23. For the first few days, it followed the wave that became Iris until a Fujiwhara interaction took place about midway between <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> and the Lesser Antilles on August 25. Humberto peaked as a strong Category 2 hurricane and remained a hurricane until just before being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone on September 1.|$|E
5|$|A {{vigorous}} {{tropical depression}} {{moved through the}} <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> islands on September13, although the complete history of the cyclone is unknown. It dissipated before affecting the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fred {{originated}} from a strong tropical wave that moved off {{the west coast}} of Africa on September6. Environmental conditions ahead of the system favored development and the system was forecast to slowly develop into a tropical cyclone. The following day, the wave tracked south of the <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> Islands; however, it was close enough to bring showers and gusty winds to the southern islands. By this time, the National Hurricane Center anticipated the system to organize into a tropical depression within 24hours. While passing near <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde,</b> a broad area of low pressure developed within the tropical wave. Following further development, the NHC declared that the low strengthened into a tropical depression, the seventh of the 2009 season, and issued their first advisory on it. Upon being classified a tropical depression, the system was located roughly 160mi (260km) south of the southernmost <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> Islands.|$|E

5|$|Immediately upon {{developing}} into {{a tropical}} depression, Julia posed {{a threat to}} <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde.</b> At the time, at least 3 to 5in (76 to 127mm) of precipitation was expected, with locally accumulations of up to 8in (203mm). In response, the Government of <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> issued a tropical storm warning for the southern portion of the archipelago, which included Maio, Sao Tiago, Fogo, and Brava. The tropical storm warning remained in effect after Julia intensified into a tropical storm; it was finally discontinued early on September 14.|$|E
5|$|In the Atlantic Ocean, the {{greatest}} concentration of loggerheads is along the southeastern coast of North America {{and in the}} Gulf of Mexico. Very few loggerheads are found along the European and African coastlines. Florida {{is the most popular}} nesting site, with more than 67,000 nests built per year. Nesting extends as far north as Virginia, as far south as Brazil, and as far east as the <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> Islands. The <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> Islands are the only significant nesting site on {{the eastern side of the}} Atlantic. Loggerheads found in the Atlantic Ocean feed from Canada to Brazil.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, a {{tropical}} wave emerged {{off the coast}} of Africa. Tracking westward, the wave developed convection over its center, and conducive conditions allowed it to develop further. The system passed through the <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> islands later that day as convection steadily weakened. Early on August 27, convection again increased and consolidated near the center, and later that day the wave developed into Tropical Depression Ten while located 420miles (675km) west of the <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> islands. Moving westward into an area of warm waters and low vertical shear, the depression steadily intensified, and was named Tropical Storm Fabian on August 28 as convection increased and banding features became more prominent.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{hurricane}} were from a tropical disturbance near {{the west coast of}} Africa on August 20. Two days later, the system organized enough to be classified a tropical depression just southwest of <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde.</b> For the next few days, the system moved west-northwestward with little change in intensity. It is estimated the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August 26, about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde.</b> Initially, the storm was elongated, although beginning on August 28 it began to intensify more quickly. That night, the storm attained hurricane status, and many nearby ships reported gale force winds.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Josephine {{formed as}} a {{tropical}} wave that emerged off {{the west coast of}} Africa near the end of August 2008. It tracked south of <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> and slowly developed, and on September2 the disturbance became Tropical Depression Ten while located south-southeast of the <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> islands. As the depression became more organized, an eye-like feature developed in the upper levels of the system. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Josephine six hours after forming. Josephine was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly.|$|E
5|$|Under {{threat from}} the {{hurricane}}, all of <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> was placed under a hurricane warning {{for the first time}} in the nation's history. Gale-force winds battered much of the Barlavento region throughout August31, downing trees and utility poles. On the easternmost islands of Boa Vista and Sal, Fred leveled roofs and left several villages without power or phone services for a few days. About 70percent of the houses in Povoação Velha suffered light to moderate damage. Across the northernmost islands, rainstorms flooded homes, washed out roads, and ruined farmland; São Nicolau endured great losses of crops and livestock. Material damage across <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> totaled US$2.5million, though the rain's overall impact on agriculture was positive and replenishing. Swells from the hurricane produced violent seas along the West African shoreline, destroying fishing villages and submerging swaths of residential areas in Senegal. Between the coasts of West Africa and <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde,</b> maritime incidents related to Fred resulted in nine deaths.|$|E

5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa, on September7. The system passed south of <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> on September8, with disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Around that time, the National Hurricane Center gave the system a medium chance of tropical cyclogenesis within 48hours. A low pressure area developed along the axis of the tropical wave on September9, which caused convective activity to increase further. The system was assessed with a high chance for tropical cyclone formation on September10. Based on satellite intensity estimates, the National Hurricane Center declared the disturbance as Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200UTC on September10, while located about 885miles (1,425km) west of <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Josephine {{passed to}} the south of the <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> islands on September2, outer rain bands {{produced}} minor rainfall, totaling around 0.55inches (14mm). There were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{decrease}} in convection shortly after forming, the large depression remained well organized, with a wind field 575mi (930km) in diameter. On August 22, as it passed 140mi (225km) to south of the <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde</b> islands, deep convection developed over the center of circulation, and early on August 23 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Debby about 300mi (485km) southwest of <b>Cape</b> <b>Verde.</b> Banding features continued to organize as the system slowly strengthened, and on August 23 Debby attained a peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) over the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters predicted Debby to continue to intensify to attain hurricane status, while its projected path placed the storm {{in an area of}} warm water temperatures and moderate upper level shear.|$|E
