5|$|A <b>cold</b> <b>front</b> moved southeastward {{from the}} East Coast of the United States on December 23, 1954, and passed over Bermuda two days later. A strong {{anticyclone}} developed behind the <b>cold</b> <b>front,</b> and on December 26 a trough extended southward from the <b>cold</b> <b>front.</b> The anticyclone moved southeastward as the trough and <b>cold</b> <b>front</b> moved eastward. The trough gradually decelerated as high pressures altered {{the upper level}} flow to that of an easterly flow. Convection increased over the trough as it moved over relatively warm waters, about 1 °C above normal, and began undergoing tropical cyclogenesis after a circulation began to develop along the northern portion of the trough. The system continued to organize as it moved to the west, and based on three ship reports confirming a closed circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on December 31 while located 770miles (1245km) east-northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors discuss {{the effects of}} <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> on the {{dynamics}} of freshwater ecosystems of southeast South America. <b>Cold</b> <b>fronts</b> originating from the Antarctic show a monthly frequency that promotes turbulence and vertical mixing in reservoirs with a consequence to homogenize nutrient distribution, dissolved oxygen and temperature. Weak thermoclines and the athelomixis process immediately before, {{during and after the}} passage of <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> interfere with phytoplankton succession in reservoirs. Cyanobacteria blooms in eutrophic reservoirs are frequently connected with periods of stratification and stability of the water column. <b>Cold</b> <b>fronts</b> in the Amazon and Pantanal lakes may produce fish killings during the process of "friagem" associated mixing events. Further studies will try to implement a model to predict the impact of <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> and prepare management procedures in order to cope with cyanobacteria blooms during warm and stable water column periods. Changes in water quality of reservoirs are expected during circulation periods caused by <b>cold</b> <b>fronts...</b>|$|R
5|$|October 1968: The last {{storm to}} impact Arizona {{during the decade}} was Hurricane Pauline, which added high amounts of {{moisture}} ahead of a <b>cold</b> <b>front</b> in early October.

5|$|Rainbands spawned {{near and}} ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which {{are able to}} produce tornadoes.

If sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a <b>cold</b> <b>front,</b> they can mask the location of the <b>cold</b> <b>front</b> itself.|$|E

40|$|During the austral spring, the {{interactions}} between the southward-moving intertropical convergence zone with <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> that progress equatorward contribute {{to the complexity of}} the timing and regional differences in South American Monsoon onset. This thesis studied the impact of <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> on the onset of the South American monsoon. Previous studies have shown that <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> undergo a seasonal transition in structure, intensity and propagation. In fact, whereas wintertime <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> bring relatively little rainfall but strong temperature anomalies to South America, summertime <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> affect the rainfall patterns well into the tropical portions of the continent but cause very small changes in temperature. <b>Cold</b> <b>fronts</b> are the dynamical trigger of monsoon onset in at least some regions of South America.   In this study the 1979 - 2007 the National Center for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis data (NCEP/NCAR) and Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) data are used to produce a composite analysis of the dynamic and thermodynamic structures, intensity and propagation of <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> that occur before ("pre-onset), during ("onset), and after ("post-onset") monsoon onset in the SACZ region. Those composites are used to study the effect of <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> on the abrupt onset of the monsoon season in the region of the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ).   The "pre-onset", "onset", and "post-onset" composites showed differences in speed and propagation of the <b>cold</b> <b>fronts.</b> In the "pre-onset" composites, <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> passed through South America quickly and did not reach the SACZ region. The "onset" composites showed <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> moving through the SACZ region and becoming stationary, bringing precipitation to the region. The precipitation in the region due to <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> is an indicator of the abrupt and dynamic onset in the region. Therefore at the time of "onset", there is a radical change in the structure and propagation of <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> propagating through South America that triggers monsoon onset in the SACZ region.   Years with normal, early and late onsets were compared to understand how thermodynamic changes, such as volumetric soil moisture, and sensible and latent heat fluxes, contribute to monsoon onset in the region. Quick changes in the thermodynamic variables right before onset in the SACZ region indicate that there is a fast onset triggered by <b>cold</b> <b>fronts.</b> In the WR, since there is a slow change in the thermodynamic variables before onset, WR onset {{does not seem to be}} associated with the passage of <b>cold</b> <b>fronts.</b>   The effect of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) on SAMS onset was also analyzed. The WR and the SACZ did not show a clustering of onset dates within the enhanced phases of the MJO for South America, therefore onset in those regions is found to not be affected by the MJO.   M.

50|$|Atmospheric {{modeling}} - Loretta J. Mickley, Dan Jacob {{and colleagues}} {{found that the}} frequency of <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> bringing cool, clear air out of Canada {{during the summer months}} declined by about 20 percent. These <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> are responsible for breaking up the hot, stagnant air that builds up regularly in summer, generating high levels of ground level ozone pollution.|$|R
5|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>fronts</b> usually {{move from}} west to east, or from {{southwest}} to northeast, but rarely from the south. Because of this, these <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> do {{not result in}} the cold being intense since they are moderated as they pass over the surrounding oceans. In the rare cases when <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> move northwards from the south (Antarctica), the cold air masses are not moderated by the surrounding oceans, resulting in very cold temperatures throughout the region. In general, the passage of <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> {{is more common in}} the south than in the north, and occurs more in winter than in summer. The movement of warm, subtropical air into the region occurs frequently in summer up to 46oS. When warm subtropical air arrives in the region, the air is dry, resulting in little precipitation, and causes temperatures to be higher than those observed in northeast Argentina.|$|R
5|$|A <b>cold</b> <b>front,</b> {{the leading}} edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsqualls—an intense frontal {{convective}} line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface <b>cold</b> <b>front</b> or behind the <b>cold</b> <b>front</b> where there may be a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow.|$|E
5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main {{differences with the}} Norwegian Cyclone Model are the fracture of the <b>cold</b> <b>front,</b> treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same, and allowing the <b>cold</b> <b>front</b> to progress through the warm sector perpendicular to the warm front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} {{tropical storm}} status, Floyd accelerated {{to the north}} in the western Caribbean Sea, due to an approaching <b>cold</b> <b>front.</b> Steadily intensifying, the storm moved over extreme western Cuba early on October12. Initially it was forecast to make landfall between Naples and Fort Myers, Florida. Unexpectedly the storm turned sharply northeastward into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters, Floyd briefly attained hurricane status on October12. Around the same time, the nearby <b>cold</b> <b>front</b> spawned a low pressure area that cut off the hurricane's inflow. While moving through the Florida Keys, Floyd became the only hurricane to affect the United States that year. However, its convection was rapidly decreasing over the center due to the front, and shortly thereafter Floyd weakened to tropical storm status. The circulation became nearly impossible to track on satellite imagery, although surface observations indicated it passed just south of Miami, Florida. The storm underwent extratropical transition as it weakened over the Bahamas, and Floyd {{was no longer a}} tropical cyclone by late on October18. The circulation dissipated within the <b>cold</b> <b>front</b> early the next day.|$|E

40|$|Using {{adiabatic}} hydrodynamical simulations, {{we follow}} the evolution of two symmetric <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> developing in the remnant of a violent z= 0. 3 massive cluster merger. The structure and location of the simulated <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> {{are very similar to}} those recently found in X-ray cluster observations, supporting the merger hypothesis for the origin of {{at least some of the}} <b>cold</b> <b>fronts.</b> The <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> are preceded by an almost spherical bow shock which originates at the core and disappears after 1. 6 Gyr. The <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> last longer and survive until z= 0. We trace back the gas mass constituting the fronts and find it initially associated with the two dense cores of the merging clusters. Conversely, we follow how the energy of the gas of the initial merging cores evolves until z= 0 from the merging and show that a fraction of this gas can escape from the local potential well of the sub-clumps. This release occurs as the sub-clumps reach their apocentre in an eccentric orbit and is due to decoupling between the dark matter and part of the gas in the sub-clump because of, first, heating of the gas at first close core passage and of, second, the effect of the global cluster pressure which peaks as the centrifugal acceleration of the sub-clump is maximal. The fraction of the gas of the sub-clump liberated in the outbound direction then cools as it expands adiabatically and constitutes the <b>cold</b> <b>fronts.</b> Comment: 18 pages, 19 figures, submitted to MNRAS, all figures are available at high resolution at [URL]...|$|R

5|$|A {{cluster of}} {{thunderstorms}} developed over Florida in late May. A shortwave trough {{brought it to}} the northeast, enhancing convection around a developing center of circulation. The low pressure area, which formed on May31, developed into a subtropical depression on June1.

It reached subtropical storm strength six hours later as it moved rapidly parallel to the East Coast of the United States. The convection continued to wrap around the center, and despite unfavorable conditions from an approaching <b>cold</b> <b>front</b> it continued to intensify. Late on June1, it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h) while off the coast of North Carolina.

5|$|A {{squall line}} (also {{known as a}} quasi-linear {{convective}} system or QLCS) is a line of thunderstorms forming along or ahead of a <b>cold</b> <b>front.</b> In the early 20th century, the term {{was used as a}} synonym for <b>cold</b> <b>front.</b> It contains heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight-line winds, and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts. Strong straight-line winds can occur where the squall line is {{in the shape of a}} bow echo. Tornadoes can occur along waves within a line echo wave pattern (LEWP), where mesoscale low-pressure areas are present. Some bow echoes which develop within the summer season are known as derechos, and they move quite fast through large sections of territory. On the back edge of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines, a wake low can be present, sometimes associated with a heat burst.|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to realize the frontal systems often interact with tropical convection over South America throughout the year and largely contributes to the convection variability in the Tropics during El Niño episodes, when the occurrence of intense blocking episodes of <b>cold</b> <b>fronts</b> over southeast of South America hinders the northward advance of <b>cold</b> <b>fronts.</b> These blocking episodes are characterized by an intensification of the Hadley circulation that propitiates a high transport of humidity and consequently a stronger subtropical jet stream than normal (Siqueira and Machado 2003).|$|R
5|$|After {{reaching}} its peak intensity, the hurricane turned north-northeastward, making landfall near San José, Sonora with winds of 90mph (145km/h).

Subsequently, the system abandoned its frontal features as its appearance became more circular. With persistent but limited convection near and {{to the west of the}} center, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated the system developed into a subtropical depression late on September 10 about 375mi (604km) west-southwest of Bermuda; it was considered subtropical because the upper-circulation was believed to have been cold-core. Operationally, advisories on the system were not initiated until 21hours later.|$|E
