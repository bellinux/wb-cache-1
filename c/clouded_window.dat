6000|$|Here {{the train}} started, and {{conversation}} in undertones became impossible, more especially {{as two of}} the farmers in the carriage were {{coming back from the}} Smithfield Cattle Show, and were discussing the prize oxen with all their might. It was very stuffy and close. Constance looked ineffably fastidious and uncomfortable, and Dolores gazed at the <b>clouded</b> <b>window,</b> and dull little lamp overhead, put in to enliven the deepening twilight. This avoiding of Uncle Reginald brought more before her mind a sense of wrong-doing than anything that had gone before. She was fond of this uncle, who always made her father's house his headquarters when in London, and used to play with her when she was a small child, and always {{to take her to the}} Zoological Gardens, till she declared she was too old to care for such a childish show, and then he and her father both laughed at her so much that she would never have forgiven anybody else; and she found he enjoyed it for his own sake far more than she did. However, he always did take her out for walks and sights that were sure to be amusing with him. Father, too, was quite bright and alive when he was in the house, and thus Dolores had nothing but pleasant associations connected with this uncle, and had heard of the chances of his coming like a ray of light, though without much hope, since the state of Ireland had prevented him from being able even to run over to take leave of her father. And now he was come, she must hide from him like a guilty thing! There was no spirit of opposition against him in her mind, and thus she could feel that she was doing something sad and strange. Moreover, she began to feel that her promise about the cheque had been a rash one, and the echo of her father's voice came back on her, saying, 'Surely, Mary, you know better than to believe a word out of Flinders's mouth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Most likely, Heathcliff noticed {{more the}} truth of what was said, than the spirit of the person who said it. His {{attention}} was roused, I saw, for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he drew his breath in suffocating sighs. I stared full at him, and laughed scornfully. The <b>clouded</b> <b>windows</b> of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which usually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did not fear to hazard another sound of derision.|$|R
50|$|This code {{of conduct}} was {{developed}} as the town and province absorbed more immigrants from other cultures. Other cultural questions arose. In 2007 a YMCA set up <b>clouded</b> <b>windows</b> to shield ultra-Orthodox Jews who had complained that youngsters could see girls and women in gym attire. There have been questions about whether voters are allowed to fill out and submit ballots while clothed in a niqab or burka, which can hide identity. A Muslim spokesman said that women are always required to show identity for public purposes, {{so it was a}} question raised unnecessarily.|$|R
40|$|Does a sudden, irritating buzz or a startling, spine-tingling 2 ̆ 2 brrinng 2 ̆ 2 {{put you in}} a {{bad mood}} for that 2 ̆ 28 o 2 ̆ 7 clock 2 ̆ 2 ? A {{well-known}} clock manufacturer has put on the market a new kind of alarm clock. A 15 -watt clear light bulb in a <b>clouded</b> plastic <b>window</b> flashes warningly on and off for 5 minutes before the ringing alarm goes off...|$|R
40|$|Fade in. Guido Anselmi, {{viewed from}} behind, sits {{alone in a}} car on a traffic-congested street. A man in {{the car in front}} of him looks back at Guido and at the camera itself. The camera pans over the roof of Guido’s car, as if trying to find the cause of the traffic. In the car to his left sits Guido’s own parents. There is a {{complete}} lack of recognizable sound as the cars idly sit and wait. Guido runs a handkerchief along the dashboard and across the windshield, attempting to clean a stain that isn’t even there. A few lanes over, a group of people stand in a bus with their arms dangling out of the windows; their faces are obstructed. White smoke begins to billow out of the vents of Guido’s car. It seems that the gaze of all of the surrounding drivers is focused on Guido, who begins to panic and tries to escape from the confinement of his automobile. The camera cuts to a shot of his mistress, Carla being disproportionately pleasured by the touch of a stranger. Guido, whose sighs and groans of anxiety can now be heard, claws at the <b>clouded</b> <b>windows</b> and attempts to kick his way through the glass. Eventually he finds his way out of the car by climbing through the sunroof. Arms outstretched, he begins to float now...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{progress}} is being made toward the contract objectives in our attempt to produce {open_quotes}Methyl Chloride via Oxyhydrochlorination of Methane. {close_quotes} Specifically, gains have been achieved in Task 1. 0 Catalyst Development and Separation Unit Operation Development and Task 4. 0 PDU Startup. Catalyst development continued forward to examine the copper, lanthanum, and lithium loadings as well as support surface area in four factor, two level, fully crossed design experiments carried out at five temperatures between 290 {degrees}C and 310 {degrees}C. Eight of the sixteen runs have been completed. Evaluation of these runs as a three factor, two level, fully crossed experiment has yielded some useful information. The choice of the Cu/La/Li metals system has been confirmed, and the high Cu, low La, low Li system hasn`t proven itself to be the most active at this point. Chemical feeds were brought on-line to the PDU. Small amounts of methyl chloride were made before the system was shut down due to equipment failure. Glass-lined equipment was found to be failing due to chemical etching. Replacement equipment with other materials of construction have been ordered. In addition, the FTIR <b>windows</b> <b>clouded</b> soon after chemical feeds were started. This materials problem is also being investigated...|$|R
60|$|There was {{the hotel}} with its gateway, and its savoury smell of cooking; {{there was the}} cafe with its bright windows, and its {{rattling}} of dominoes; there was the dyer's with its strips of red cloth on the doorposts; there was the silversmith's with its earrings, and its offerings for altars; there was the tobacco dealer's with its lively group of soldier customers coming out pipe in mouth; there were the bad odours of the town, and {{the rain and the}} refuse in the kennels, and the faint lamps slung across the road, and the huge Diligence, and its mountain of luggage, and its six grey horses with their tails tied up, getting under weigh at the coach office. But no small cabaret for a straitened traveller being within sight, he had to seek one round the dark corner, where the cabbage leaves lay thickest, trodden about the public cistern at which women had not yet left off drawing water. There, in the back street he found one, the Break of Day. The curtained <b>windows</b> <b>clouded</b> the Break of Day, but it seemed light and warm, and it announced in legible inscriptions with appropriate pictorial embellishment of billiard cue and ball, that at the Break of Day one could play billiards; that there one could find meat, drink, and lodgings, whether one came on horseback, or came on foot; and that it kept good wines, liqueurs, and brandy. The man turned the handle of the Break of Day door, and limped in.|$|R
