40|$|A {{qualitative}} {{study was conducted}} to explore "cliff effects," the overall dip in household resources when working poor families become ineligible for government work supports. The study included a survey of 78 low-income women and 32 social service providers, followed by interviews with smaller subsets of each. We asked how low-income women who are either on the verge of government support loss or who have recently experienced government support loss manage this circumstance and explored the effects on families' well-being. We found that the participants with the highest average income ($ 34, 000 /year) were doing worse in terms of their well-being than those with lower incomes. We recommend updating eligibility work support criteria and increasing support levels, developing "cliff effect trainings" for social service providers, and improving accessibility to higher education for working parents.

We extend this approximation to nonlinear waves {{up to the second}} order in wave steepness, in order to simplify the inherently three-dimensional task. Assuming that the geometrical complexity is restricted to a finite, though large, horizontal domain, the hybrid-element method designed earlier for linearized problems is modified for the two-dimensional elliptic boundary-value problems at the second order.

40|$|Multicasting {{of video}} signals over {{wireless}} networks has recently {{become a very}} popular application. Here, one major challenge is to accommodate heterogeneous users who have different channel characteristics and therefore will receive different noise-corrupted video packets of the same video source that is multicasted over the wireless network. This paper proposes a distributed compressed sensing based multicast scheme (DCS-cast), where a block-wise compressed sensing (BCS) is applied on video frames to obtain measurement data. The measurement data are then packed in an interleaved fashion and transmitted over OFDM channels. At the decoder side, users with different channel characteristics receive {{a certain number of}} packets and then reconstruct video frames by exploiting motion-based information. Due {{to the fact that the}} CS-measuring and interleaved packing together produce equally-important packets, users with good channel conditions will receive more packets so as to recover a better quality, which guarantees our DCS-cast scheme with a very graceful degradation rather than <b>cliff</b> <b>effects.</b> As compared to the benchmark SoftCast scheme, our DCS-cast is able to provide a better performance when some packets are lost during the transmission. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|Asset-backed {{securities}} (ABSs) are securities {{created through}} a securitization process whose value and income payments are {{backed by a}} specific pool of underlying assets. A securitization credit rating is {{an assessment of the}} credit risk of securitization transaction, addressing how well the credit risk of the assets is mitigated by the structure. The rating process is based on both quantitative assessment and a qualitative analysis of how the transaction mitigates losses due to defaults. Typically the input parameters to the quantitative assessment are unknown and estimated from historical data or given by expert opinions. In either case, the values used for the parameters are uncertain and these uncertainties propagates through the model and generates uncertainty in the rating output. This introduces uncertainty into the assessment and it therefore becomes important to understand the ratings parameter sensitivity. The objectives of this chapter are twofold. Firstly, we advocate the use of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques to enhance the understanding of the variability of the credit ratings due to the uncertainty in the input parameters. Uncertainty analysis quantifies the variability in the output of interest due to the variability in the inputs. Global sensitivity analysis assesses how the uncertainty in the output can be allocated to its different sources. Through global sensitivity analysis, we quantify the percentage of output variance that each input or combination of inputs accounts for. Secondly, we propose a novel rating approach called global rating, that takes this uncertainty in the output into account when assigning ratings to tranches. The global ratings should therefore become more stable and reduce the risk of <b>cliff</b> <b>effects,</b> that is, that a small change in one or several of the input assumptions generates a dramatic change in the rating. The global rating methodology proposed gives one answer of a way forward for the rating of structure finance products. JRC. G. 1 -Scientific Support to Financial Analysi...|$|R

30|$|Approach: We {{selected}} {{a representative sample}} of a small number of pull requests that reflect the larger population. We selected 334 random pull requests made at atom for manual analysis, which represents a confidence level of 95 % with a ±[*] 5 % confidence interval. We also validated this analysis with another manual analysis in a random sample of 150 pull requests accepted at hubot. The qualitative analysis was conducted in parallel by two researchers, who investigated the pull requests individually. We also quantitatively compared the characteristics of the pull requests placed by internal and external members in terms of number files changed, added lines, deleted lines, and the number of commits per pull request. We considered each pull request as an observation and, once again, we used MWW tests [6] and <b>Cliff’s</b> delta <b>effect</b> size measures [9] to compare the groups.

40|$|Engineering Dynamics (ED) {{courses are}} known as {{challenging}} and demanding for undergraduate students majored in many engineering fields, such as mechanical and aerospace engineering and civil and environmental engineering. The course is built upon the foundation and framework of mathematics and physics and requires students to have strong abstract thinking and reasoning skills. Rigid body dynamics (RBD), {{the second part of}} ED, investigates kinematics and kinetics of rigid bodies and is considered as a difficult subject by many undergraduate students because the course requires them to visualize abstract objects in motions. Although there have been many studies reporting the uses of interactive computer simulation and animation (CSA) modules as visual learning tools in RBD instruction, the effectiveness of the CSA modules on student learning of RBD were not rigorously and adequately investigated. This study employs a mixed method (QUAN – qual) approach and nonequivalent comparison group design to investigate the effectiveness of CSA modules on student learning of RBD, and to explore students’ attitudes towards and experiences with these modules. One hundred and sixty-one students in two recent semesters participated in this study: 74 in one semester participated in the comparison group and 87 in another semester participated in the intervention group. While the intervention group students studied RBD with CSA modules along with traditional lectures, the comparison group students studied RBD with traditional lectures only. Students in both groups were assessed with pretests and posttests using 10 bonus homework assignments developed to address core knowledge areas of RBD. The study uses a set of nonparametric statistical tools to analyze the pretest and posttest scores, mean differences, and magnitudes of the differences in learning gains between the two groups. Research findings from this study reveal that the intervention group students showed a significant increase in learning gains of overall knowledge, conceptual understanding, and procedural skills with <b>Cliff’s</b> <b>effect</b> sizes of 0. 49, 0. 41, and 0. 47, respectively. CSA modules increased the intervention group students’ confidence, but they did not increase students’ motivation of learning RBD.

As we predicted, we found that Tufted Puffins (1) dilute danger by synchronizing their fly-in and departure activities, (2) reduce fly-in and departure activity rates when predators are present, and (3) switch to lower-risk fly-in activities (e. g., staying over water where they have an escape route from an aerial attack) when predators are present...|$|R
40|$|Representation {{use is a}} {{critical}} skill for learning, problem solving, and communicating in science, especially in physics where multiple representations often scaffold the understanding of a phenomenon. University Modeling Instruction, which is an active-learning, research-based introductory physics curriculum centered on students’ use of scientific models, has made representation use a primary learning goal with explicit class time devoted to introducing and coordinating representations {{as part of the}} model building process. However, because of the semester break, the second semester course, Modeling Instruction-Electricity and Magnetism (MI-EM), contains a mixture of students who are returning from the Modeling Instruction-mechanics course (to whom we refer to as “returning students”) and students who are new to Modeling Instruction with the MI-EM course (to whom we refer to as “new students”). In this study, we analyze the impact of MI-EM on students’ representation choices across the introductory physics content for these different groups of students by examining both what individual representations students choose and their average number of representations on a modified card-sort survey with a variety of mechanics and EM questions. Using Wilcoxon-signed-rank tests, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests, <b>Cliff’s</b> delta <b>effect</b> sizes, and box plots, we compare students’ representation choices from pre- to postsemester, from new and returning students, and from mechanics and EM content. We find that there is a significant difference between returning and new students’ representation choices, which serves as a baseline comparison between Modeling Instruction and traditional lecture-based physics classes. We also find that returning students maintain a high representation use across the MI-EM semester, while new students see significant growth in their representation use regardless of content...|$|R
40|$|The tight {{linkage between}} {{sovereign}} and bank balance sheets magni ed {{the depth of}} the European sovereign debt crisis. As a response to this, reform efforts are therefore focused on severing this vicious tie. Some progress has been made. The Banking Union framework addresses the transfer of banking sector risk to the sovereign. Policy makers are now discussing how to address the treatment of sovereign debt on bank balance sheets. Currently, it is treated as risk free. Zero risk weights are applied, meaning banks do not need to set aside capital to protect themselves from potential losses in these securities. Nor do banks have any limits on their exposure to a particular sovereign. This discussion paper analyses the two widely discussed basic options to address this regulatory gap: applying non-zero risk weights to sovereign expo- sures, and putting limits on exposures to sovereigns, akin to those in place for other exposures. Although this paper analyses each option in isolation, the two complement one another as they target different facets of risk. Positive risk weights address counterparty credit risk, whereas large exposure limits address concentration risk. Both policy options would, according to our analysis, lead to improved bank risk management and render banks more resilient. They would equip them to better absorb losses: positive risk weights would require higher capital buffers and exposure limits would lead to greater diversi cation. Positive risk weights would also improve risk transparency and correct distorted incentives for investing in sovereign bonds. At the systemic level, leverage would decrease and losses in the event of default would be more spread out. On the downside, both regula- tory proposals would lower bank pro tability in the short run. In the longer run, positive risk-weights could permanently reduce bank pro ts by increasing their funding costs, while exposure limits would lead to a more diversi ed portfolio and lower funding costs. The bene ts in terms of increased resilience in the banking sector would come at a cost for some sovereigns. Sovereign bond holdings would become more costly in terms of capital if positive risk weights were applied or the exposures were capped by a hard limit. In both cases, banks would try to deal with excess sovereign bonds on their balance sheets by injecting fresh capital or reducing their portfolio of sovereign bonds. An increased supply of sovereign paper, or a lack of demand for new issues, would raise funding costs for the sovereign and consequently for the whole economy. Furthermore, both policy options would lower liquidity in the sovereign debt markets, as they add to the cost and hinder the ability of banks to provide market-making services. Exposure limits in partic- ular would have signi cant repercussions on markets in the short run, as banks traditionally have large exposures to domestic sovereigns {{that they would have to}} shed. Other market participants would need to absorb this additional supply. Sovereigns would need to re-arrange their nancing sources, which could prove challenging. Additionally, the two options could aggravate long-run macro-level cyclical developments for stressed sovereigns. During an economic downturn, an increased riskiness of a sovereign would translate into higher risk weights and a higher capital charge for the bank holding its debt. This would further worsen nancing conditions for sovereigns precisely at the time when scal space is most needed. Similarly, exposure limits could lead to <b>cliff</b> <b>effects</b> in a downturn, if sovereigns fail to extend their investor base. We expect that introducing positive risk weights would have the largest effect on stressed sovereigns, while imposing exposure limits would impact sovereigns with large outstanding debt volumes the most. The trade-off between strengthening the resilience of the banking sector to sovereign risk and maintaining the investor base for European sovereigns makes the issue of adjusting regulation particularly complex. Any policy decision needs to take into account the effects it would have on sovereign funding conditions. In addition, as banks traditionally hold large amounts of sovereign debt, any regulatory change could have a large initial impact with potentially destabilising consequences. Hence, a gradual and transparent transition would be crucial for a successful implementation of any combination of the two alternatives...|$|R

5000|$|In telecommunications, the (digital) <b>cliff</b> <b>effect</b> or brickwall {{effect is}} a sudden loss of digital signal reception. Unlike analog signals, which {{gradually}} fade when signal strength decreases or electromagnetic interference or multipath increases, a digital signal provides data which is either perfect or non-existent at the receiving end.

50|$|Changes in signal {{reception}} from {{factors such}} as degrading antenna connections or changing weather conditions may gradually reduce the quality of analog TV. The nature of digital TV results in a perfectly decodable video initially, until the receiving equipment starts picking up interference that overpowers the desired signal or if the signal is too weak to decode. Some equipment will show a garbled picture with significant damage, while other devices may go directly from perfectly decodable video to no video at all or lock up. This phenomenon {{is known as the}} digital <b>cliff</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
50|$|Solar transit {{begins with}} only a brief {{degradation}} in signal quality for a few moments. At the same time each day, {{for the next several}} days, it gets longer and gets worse, until finally gradually improving after several more days. For digital satellite services, the <b>cliff</b> <b>effect</b> will eliminate reception entirely at a given threshold. Reception is typically lost for only a few minutes on the worst day, but the beam width of the dish can affect this. Signal strength also affects this, as does the bandwidth of the signal. If the power is concentrated into a narrower band, there is a higher signal-to-noise ratio. If the same signal is spread wider, the receiver also gets a wider swath of noise, degrading reception.|$|E
50|$|A {{major concern}} is that the {{broadcast}} technology used for ATSC signals called 8VSB has problems receiving signals inside buildings and in urban areas, largely due to multipath reception issues which cause ghosting and fading on analog images, but can lead to intermittent signal or no reception at all on ATSC programs. DTV broadcasts exhibit a digital <b>cliff</b> <b>effect,</b> by which viewers will receive either a perfect signal or no signal at all with little or no middle ground. Digital transmissions do contain additional data bits to provide error correction for a finite number of bit errors; once signal quality degrades beyond that point, recovery of the original digital signal becomes impossible, and the image on the screen freezes, or blinks back and forth to totally blank black.|$|E
50|$|Three {{particular}} issues particularly manifest the <b>cliff</b> <b>effect.</b> Firstly, anomalous {{conditions will}} cause occasional signal degradation. Secondly, {{if one is}} located in a fringe area, where the antenna is just barely strong enough to receive the signal, then usual variation in signal quality will cause relatively frequent signal degradation, and a very small change in overall signal quality can have a dramatic impact on the frequency of signal degradation - one incident per hour (not significantly affecting watchability) versus problems every few seconds or continuous problems. Thirdly, in some cases, where the signal is beyond the cliff (in unwatchable territory), viewers who were once able to receive a degraded signal from analog stations will find after digital transition that there is no available signal in rural, fringe or mountainous regions.|$|E

In the future all-digital mode, there is no analog to fall back to {{at the edge of the}} digital cliff. This applies only to the main channel simulcast, and not to any subchannels, because they have nothing to fall back to. It is also important for the station's broadcast engineer to make sure that the audio signal is synchronized between analog and digital, or the <b>cliff</b> <b>effect</b> will still cause a jump slightly forward or backward in the radio program.|$|E

The Multiplex & SFN concepts are advantageous to State Broadcasters and Large Pan National Multi-channel companies and worse for all Local, Community and most Regional stations.

50|$|Digital {{radio and}} digital {{television}} {{can also be}} received, however there is much greater difficulty with reception of weak signals due to the <b>cliff</b> <b>effect,</b> particularly with the ATSC TV standard mandated in the U.S. However when the signal {{is strong enough to}} be decoded identification is much easier than with analog TV as the picture is guaranteed to be noise free when present. For DVB-T, hierarchical modulation may allow a lower-definition signal to be received even if the details of the full signal cannot be decoded. In reality, though, it's actually much more difficult to get DVB-T E-skip reception as the lowest channel DVB-T transmissions operate on is channel E5 which is 178 MHz. A unique issue observed on analog TV {{at the end of the}} DTV transition in the United States was that very distant analog stations were viewable in the hours after the permanent shutdown of local analog transmitters in June 2009. This was particularly pronounced because June is one of the strongest months for DX reception on VHF, and most digital stations were assigned to UHF.|$|E

30|$|In {{conventional}} wireless video multicast, a video bitstream coded at {{a specific}} bit rate is transmitted over the wireless network. For example, the digital video broadcasting (DVB) scheme [1] transmits the bitstream compressed by the traditional video coding standard over a wireless channel. However, this fixed bit rate usually incurs “unfairness” to users in a multicast group: if the rate accords with a low-quality receiver, users with better channel characteristics only obtain a low-quality video; alternatively, if the rate is selected for a high-quality user, the low-quality users cannot decode the bitstream at all. On the other hand, the conventional wireless video transmission schemes have another disadvantage: they are not resilient to channel errors or noise, thus leading to a sharp decrease of reconstructed video quality (the so-called <b>cliff</b> <b>effect)</b> when the channel is corrupted by noise (it is very common in practice), and the reconstructed video quality will not improve even when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) becomes larger [2]. The emergence of the layered digital scheme alleviates the <b>cliff</b> <b>effect</b> through {{the combination of a}} layered video coding and a layered video transmission. Typically, scalable video coding (SVC) [3] is utilized as the layered video coding technique, and hierarchical modulation (h-mod) [4] is adopted as the layered transmission scheme.

40|$|Cliff {{effects in}} the Internal Revenue Code trigger a sudden {{increase}} of federal tax liability when some attribute of a taxpayer—most commonly income—exceeds a particular threshold value. As a result, two taxpayers in nearly identical economic situations can face considerably different tax liabilities depending on {{which side of the}} triggering criterion they fall. The magnitude of the equity and efficiency costs associated with cliff effects is significant: cliff effects are attached to tax provisions amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars, the majority of which are targeted at low- and moderate-income taxpayers. Cliff effects have received little attention in legal academia. Prior scholarship has primarily discussed the relevant tax provisions in isolation, focusing on financial consequences on a single taxpayer or limiting analysis to taxpayers in one geographic area. This Article addresses the void in legal scholarship by first recognizing potential rationales for cliff effects and identifying situations where their definitional clarity might compensate for any equity and efficiency losses. Next, the individual and aggregate costs of cliff effects are quantified and plausible statutory alternatives are identified. This Article argues that a <b>cliff</b> <b>effect</b> based on income is necessarily problematic on both equity and efficiency grounds because it improperly penalizes taxpayers and disincentivizes the economic empowerment the associated tax provision is intended to promote. A methodology is then provided by which these costs can be compared to the potential savings provided by the bright-line rule of the <b>cliff</b> <b>effect.</b> This empirical analysis is performed on the two cliff effects of the health premium subsidy of the Affordable Care Act and finds that the cliff effects will, if unchecked, represent a misallocation of over $ 8. 5 billion by 2025. This Article presents several options for replacing problematic cliff effects, including those in the health care subsidy. The most novel of these strategies awards a credit based on the severity of the <b>cliff</b> <b>effect</b> and ensures that no taxpayer is made worse off post-tax by virtue of earning more pre-tax income. The Article concludes by extending the analysis to cliff effects associated with state and local tax regimes and direct transfer programs...|$|E
