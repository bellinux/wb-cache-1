5|$|PD {{invariably}} progresses with time. A severity rating method {{known as}} the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) is {{the most commonly used}} metric for <b>clinical</b> <b>study.</b> A modified version {{known as the}} MDS-UPDRS is also sometimes used. An older scaling method known as the Hoehn and Yahr scale (originally published in 1967), and a similar scale known as the Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale, have also been commonly used. The Hoehn and Yahr scale defines five basic stages of progression.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>clinical</b> <b>study</b> of {{psilocybin}} {{approved by}} the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1970—led by Francisco Moreno at the University of Arizona {{and supported by the}} Heffter Research Institute and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies—studied the effects of psilocybin on patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). The pilot study found that, when administered by trained professionals in a medical setting, the use of psilocybin was associated with substantial reductions in OCD symptoms in several of the patients. This effect is caused largely by psilocybin's ability to reduce the levels of the 5-HT2A receptor, resulting in decreased responsiveness to serotonin.|$|E
5|$|The {{images and}} media reports of {{children}} dying terrorized many children who, {{as demonstrated by}} later research, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Children became a primary focus of concern {{in the mental health}} response to bombing and many bomb related services were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a <b>clinical</b> <b>study</b> of {{middle and high school students}} conducted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students that had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
40|$|Background {{and purpose}} — The {{proximal}} femur locking compression plate (PF-LCP) {{is a new}} concept {{in the treatment of}} hip fractures. When releasing new implants onto the market, biomechanical studies are conducted to evaluate performance of the implant. We investigated the relation between biomechanical and <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> on PF-LCP. Methods — A systematic literature search of relevant biomechanical and <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> was conducted in PubMed on December 1, 2015. 7 biomechanical <b>studies</b> and 15 <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> were included. Results — Even though the biomechanical studies showed equivalent or higher failure loads for femoral neck fracture, the clinical results were far worse, with a 37 % complication rate. There were no biomechanical studies on pertrochanteric fractures. Biomechanical studies on subtrochanteric fractures showed that PF-LCP had a lower failure load than with proximal femoral nail, but higher than with angled blade plate. 4 <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> had complication rates less than 8 % and 9 studies had complication rates between 15 % and 53 %. Interpretation — There was no clear relation between biomechanical and <b>clinical</b> <b>studies.</b> Biomechanical studies are generally inherently different from <b>clinical</b> <b>studies,</b> as they examine the best possible theoretical use of the implant without considering the long-term outcome in a clinical setting. Properly designed <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> are mandatory when introducing new implants, and they cannot be replaced by biomechanical studies...|$|R
30|$|<b>Clinical</b> <b>studies</b> have {{examined}} O 2 and CO 2 exchange during vv-ECMO for respiratory failure [5]. Circuit blood flow {{was the main}} determinant of arterial oxygenation, while the sweep gas flow through the oxygenator was the main determinant of CO 2 elimination. While <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> are important in exploring vv-ECMO physiology, mathematical modelling is an essential tool to extend understanding of physiological systems [6]. It enables study of dynamic scenarios that cannot be examined in <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> due to ethical considerations, the inability to isolate the effects of changing a single parameter due to reflex responses and the logistics of <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> in {{a limited number of}} patients.|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 142 <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> have {{been devoted to}} the {{treatment}} of envenomations, of which 115 address snake bites, 20 scorpion stings, and 8 other animals (one addresses both snake and spider envenomation). Antivenom use was studied in 118, of which 82 addressed efficacy, 43 evaluated safety, 23 studied dosage and 8 explored other issues. Besides anecdotal clinical reports, three classes of <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> are distinguished: (a) observational <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> (55 of the total) which analyze series of cases, (b) comparative <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> (36) which compare therapeutic products or treatment regimens without a gold standard for comparison and (c) randomized clinical trials (RCT, 51). The goals, methods and constraints of design of RCT are determined by whether explanatory (analytical) or pragmatic considerations are prioritized. Explanation-oriented RCT rely on strict group comparability before and during treatment, in order to ensure the internal validity of the study. The pragmatically-oriented RCT aims at establishing the superiority of a treatment over another, the goal being to maximize the external validity of the trial (that is, its application in current practice). We found that all <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> of treatment of envenomation lean markedly toward the explanatory end and suggest that, given some particularities of envenomation as a medical condition, a more pragmatic approach may be of value, particularly under the conditions prevalent for <b>clinical</b> <b>studies</b> in developing nations...|$|R
