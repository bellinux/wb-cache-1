40|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>rules</b> are the {{overarching}} constraints {{that govern the}} operation of equipment on the International Space Station (ISS) and the Space Shuttle. There are thousands of <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> for ISS, all documented in Microsoft Word. Monitoring of <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> is currently done manually by flight controllers who are highly trained in understanding and interpreting <b>flight</b> <b>rules.</b> In this paper we describe a system that allows <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> to be expressed in a computer-understandable language and that then generates an automated monitoring system that connects to the ISS telemetry stream. For testing purposes we represented and monitored Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS) <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> for ISS smoke detectors. We describe how this <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> is represented in an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format that captures relationships between different pieces of raw telemetry. We describe a drag-and-drop editing environment that allows for easy authoring and debugging of the XML. We then describe how this XML file is translated into a monitoring capability that automatically executes the appropriate functions to validate or invalidate the <b>flight</b> <b>rule.</b> Finally, we show examples from actual ISS telemetry of the real-time monitoring of this specific <b>flight</b> <b>rule.</b> A <b>flight</b> controller interface has been designed using {{the next generation of}} mission control tools to allow easy configuration, manipulation and supervision of <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> monitoring. This <b>flight</b> controller interface will work in concert with the editor and execution engine to enhance the safety of space missions by automatically detecting <b>flight</b> <b>rule</b> violations.

40|$|The Cassini {{spacecraft}} {{was launched}} on October 15, 1997 {{and arrived at}} Saturn on June 30, 2004. It has performed detailed observations and remote sensing of Saturn, its rings, and its satellites since that time. Cassini deployed the European-built Huygens probe which descended through the Titan atmosphere and landed on its surface on January 14, 2005. Operating the Cassini spacecraft is a complex scientific, engineering, and management job. In order to safely operate the spacecraft, {{a large number of}} <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> were developed. These <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> must be enforced throughout the lifetime of the Cassini spacecraft. <b>Flight</b> <b>rules</b> are defined as any operational limitation imposed by the spacecraft system design, hardware, and software, violation of which would result in spacecraft damage, loss of consumables, loss of mission objectives, loss and/or degradation of science, and less than optimal performance. <b>Flight</b> <b>rules</b> require clear description and rationale. Detailed automated methods have been developed to insure the spacecraft is continuously operated within these <b>flight</b> <b>rules.</b> An overview of all the <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> allocated to the Cassini Attitude Control and Articulation Subsystem and how they are enforced is presented in this paper...|$|R

50|$|Visual <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> are {{generally}} simpler than instrument <b>flight</b> <b>rules,</b> and require significantly less training and practice.

40|$|Typically {{during the}} design and {{development}} of a NASA space mission, rules and constraints are identified to help reduce reasons for failure during operations. These <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> are usually captured {{in a set of}} indexed tables, containing rule descriptions, rationales for the rules, and other information. <b>Flight</b> <b>rules</b> can be part of manual operations procedures carried out by humans. However, they can also be automated, and either implemented as on-board monitors, or as ground based monitors that are part of a ground data system. In the case of automated <b>flight</b> <b>rules,</b> one considerable expense to be addressed for any mission is the extensive process by which system engineers express <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> in prose, software developers translate these requirements into code, and then both experts verify that the resulting application is correct.

40|$|Abstract. We {{address the}} problem of verifying {{planning}} domains as used in model-based planning, for example in space missions. We propose a methodology for testing <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> of planning domains which is selfcontained, in the sense that <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> are verified using a planner and no external tools are required. We review and analyse coverage conditions for requirements-based testing, and we reason in detail on ”Unique First Cause ” (UFC) coverage for test suites. We characterise <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> using patterns, encoded using LTL, and we provide UFC coverage for them. We then present a translation of LTL formulae into planning goals, and illustrate our approach on a case study. ...|$|R
