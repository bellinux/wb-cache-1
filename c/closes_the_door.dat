25|$|During {{the filming}} of The Bread and Alley in 1970, Kiarostami had major {{differences}} with his experienced cinematographer about how to film {{the boy and the}} attacking dog. While the cinematographer wanted separate shots of the boy approaching, a close-up of his hand as he enters the house and <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> followed by a shot of the dog, Kiarostami believed that if the three scenes could be captured as a whole it would have a more profound impact in creating tension over the situation. That one shot took around forty days to complete, until Kiarostami was fully content with the scene. Kiarostami later commented that the breaking of scenes would have disrupted the rhythm and content of the film's structure, preferring to let the scene flow as one.|$|E
