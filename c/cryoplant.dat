Due {{to the implementation of}} the X-ray free electron laser European XFEL, the existing HERA refrigeration plants have been adapted to the new heat load requirements. To provide the required cooling power for the XFEL, two of the three HERA refrigerator plants have been modified and will serve as the XFEL <b>cryoplant.</b> A 2 K cooling loop of approximately 2. 6 kW comprising a string of four cold compressors has been included into the XFEL <b>cryoplant.</b> The 2 K cooling loop features a full flow recooling bypass across the cold compressors, providing high turn down ability during part load. Since the <b>cryoplant</b> is designed for 17. 5 GeV beam load operation and prepared for further upgrade options already, efficient operation at future project stages is ensured.

40|$|Tokamak {{nuclear fusion}} {{reactors}} {{based on the}} magnetic confinement of the plasma, such as the ITER, under construction in France, are characterized by very large temperature differences (from the 108 K of the plasma core to the few K of the superconducting magnets) over a few meters. Heat transfer is therefore a critical issue, especially at the interface between different reactor subsystems, for instance the magnet - <b>cryoplant</b> interface, at which pulsed heat loads coming from the superconducting coils during tokamak operation are released to the <b>cryoplant.</b> The smoothing of these variable heat loads is a critical issue {{in order to avoid}} the oversizing of the refrigerators as well as to ensure a stable operation with power loads as constant as possible. Experimental devices, like the HELIOS loop at CEA Grenoble (France), as well as detailed computational tools, such as the 4 C code, have been used to study possible control strategies to smooth the pulsed heat loads to the <b>cryoplant.</b> These tools can provide a detailed overview of the magnets dynamics, up to the conductors cooling channels, requiring a large computational effort to solve sets of partial non-linear differential equations. However, from the <b>cryoplant</b> side, simplified models of the magnetic system response to the different operating scenarios, predicting the evolution of the heat load, are sufficient to carefully design the control scenarios and strategies. Simplified models based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been developed and tested on cryogenic loops, and have proved to be fast and accurate in predicting the power released from the magnets to the <b>cryoplant</b> during nominal operation, i. e. without any regulation acting on the system. The present work proposes a new approach for a simplified modeling of the heat transfer to the <b>cryoplant,</b> based again on ANNs, easy to handle and able to cope with control and regulation of the plant. The feasibility of the new approach is demonstrated and validated on different HELIOS test cases, adopting the state-of-the-art 4 C code as source of data for the ANN training. Next, an optimized ANN-based model is developed for the ITER CS and TF magnets and its predictive capability demonstrated against 4 C data. Thanks to their high speed of computation, the ANN-based models are used to address different control strategies for the smoothing of the pulse heat loads released to the <b>cryoplant</b> and perform fast parametric studies for the optimization of the control and regulation acting on the system. Once the best control strategy has been identified, a detailed 4 C simulation is used as a benchmark to prove the accuracy of the ANN-based model...|$|E

40|$|The design {{concept of}} the CMS experiment, {{foreseen}} for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) project at CERN, {{is based on a}} superconducting solenoid magnet. The large coil will be made of a four layers winding generating the 4 T uniform magnetic induction required by the detector. The length of the solenoid is 13 m with an inner diameter of 5. 9 m. The mass kept at liquid helium temperature totals 220 t and the electromagnetic stored energy is 2. 7 GJ. The windings are indirectly cooled with a liquid helium flow driven by a thermosyphon effect. The external cryogenic system consists of a 1. 5 kW at 4. 5 K (entropy equivalent) <b>cryoplant</b> including an additional liquid nitrogen precooling unit and a 5000 litre liquid helium buffer. The whole magnet and cryogenic system will be tested at the surface by 2003 before final installation in the underground area of LHC...|$|E
40|$|CERN {{regularly}} uses a {{large number}} of liquid helium cryoplants for cooling the superconducting magnets of large particle detectors. They are installed in the experimental areas of the electron-positron collider LEP and the proton (and heavy ion) accelerator SPS for the observation of high-energy interactions of elementary particles. The typical cold mass of a detector magnet ranges from 1 to 40 tons, and typical <b>cryoplant</b> cooling capacities are between 400 and 800 W/ 4. 5 K entropy equivalent. Operation must be very flexible to meet the varying experimental requirements. We intend to present technical data of the system and statistics from over 180 ' 000 running hours during the four years from 1992 to 1995. Operation includes phases of cool-down, steady-state cooling, recovery after magnet quench or other incidents and warm-up of the superconducting magnets. Emphasis will be laid on the analysis of fault conditions, multiple interaction between perturbations and consequences for the users of liquid helium supply interruption...|$|E
40|$|CERN uses several liquid helium cryoplants (total of 21) {{for cooling}} large variety of superconducting devices namely: {{accelerating}} cavities, magnets for accelerators and particle detectors. The cryoplants are remotely operated from several control rooms using industrial standard supervision systems, {{which allows the}} instant display of all plant data and the trends, over several days, for the most important signals. The monitoring of the <b>cryoplant</b> performance during transient conditions and normal operation over several months asks for a long-term recording of all plant parameters. An historical data recording system has been developed, which collects data from all cryoplants, stores them in a centralized database {{over a period of}} one year and allows an user-friendly graphical visualization. In particular, a novel tool was developed for debugging causes of plant failures by comparing selected reference data with the simultaneous evolution of all plant data. The paper describes the new system, already in operation with 11 cryoplants...|$|E
40|$|In superconducting tokamaks, cryoplants {{provide the}} helium needed {{to cool the}} superconducting magnet systems. The {{evaluation}} of the heat load from the magnets to the <b>cryoplant</b> is fundamental {{for the design of}} the latter and the assessment of suitable strategies to smooth the heat load pulses induced by the pulsed plasma scenarios is crucial for the operation. Here, a simplified thermal-hydraulic model of an ITER Toroidal Field (TF) magnet, based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), is developed and inserted into a detailed model of the ITER TF winding and casing cooling circuits based on the state-of-the-art 4 C code, which also includes active controls. The low computational effort requested by such a model allows performing a fast parametric study, to identify the best smoothing strategy during standard plasma operation. The ANNs are trained using 4 C simulations, and the predictive capabilities of the simplified model are assessed against 4 C simulations, both with and without active smoothing, in terms of accuracy and computational tim...|$|E
