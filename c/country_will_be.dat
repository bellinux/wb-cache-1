25|$|Even though Trami didn't made {{landfall}} {{over the}} Philippines, the storm did enhanced the southwest monsoon which brought extreme flooding {{throughout most of}} the country on August 18. Due to this, the government declares suspension of classes in some areas and PAGASA subsequently issued several rainfall advisories. Major areas in Metro Manila and nearby provinces reported severe flooding. The Marikina River as high as 19 meters, forcing authorities evacuate nearby residents. 8 people in the Philippines have been killed due to flooding. Monsoon rains are seen in Metro Manila, Regions I, IV-A, IV-B and V which may trigger flashfloods and landslides. Western Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula and the rest of Luzon will have cloudy skies with light to moderate rainshowers and thunderstorms, Pagasa added. The rest of the <b>country</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> partly cloudy to cloudy with isolated rainshowers or thunderstorms, it also said. More than half of Manila was flooded on the morning of August 20, although waters in some areas subsided by about 20 percent in the evening, authorities said. For two days, classes and work in government offices were suspended in Metro Manila and surrounding provinces of Laguna and Cavite, which bore the brunt of the heavy downpour.

In 1967, the Cabinet of Rhodesia started a contest to design a new flag for the country.

For these two reasons the Committee recommend that the Union Flag should not be incorporated into the new Rhodesian flag." [...] There were calls for the Southern Rhodesian flag to be retained, led by the Minister of Foreign Affairs the Duke of Montrose, who said it represented Rhodesia's past and was a symbol of their active rebellion against the British government. Despite these calls, the flag of Southern Rhodesia was abandoned and replaced with the new flag of Rhodesia in 1968. During the formal changeover ceremony on the third anniversary of UDI, Smith noticeably expressed sadness when the flag of Southern Rhodesia was lowered to the Last Post.|$|E
