5|$|Roaring Brook has a {{high level}} of water quality {{downstream}} as far as Cobbs Gap. However, in its lower reaches, it is impacted by urban storm impacts and abandoned mining land. Silt from the DeNaples Auto Parts property washed into the stream in 1991. There are also stormwater impacts and <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows in its lower reaches. Most of the stormwater flowing into the stream is associated with a <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> system in Scranton and Dunmore. Some highways in the watershed contribute stormwater as well. It is also affected by stormwater from the Daleville Shopping area, the village of Elmhurst, the borough of Moscow, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. There are 12 stormwater detention facilities in the watershed's lower reaches.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E
5000|$|The {{maintenance}} requirements {{vary with the}} type of sanitary sewer. In general, all sewers deteriorate with age, but infiltration and inflow are problems unique to sanitary <b>sewers,</b> since both <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> and storm drains are sized to carry these contributions. Holding infiltration to acceptable levels requires a higher standard of maintenance than necessary for structural integrity considerations of <b>combined</b> <b>sewers.</b> [...] A comprehensive construction inspection program is required to prevent inappropriate connection of cellar, yard, and roof drains to sanitary sewers. [...] The probability of inappropriate connections is higher where <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> and sanitary sewers are found in close proximity, because construction personnel may not recognize the difference. Many older cities still use <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> while adjacent suburbs were built with separate sanitary sewers.|$|R
50|$|Sanitary <b>sewers</b> {{evolved from}} <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> built where water was plentiful. Animal feces {{accumulated}} on city streets while animal-powered transport moved people and goods. Accumulations of animal feces encouraged dumping chamber pots into streets where night soil collection was impractical. <b>Combined</b> <b>sewers</b> were built to use surface runoff to flush waste off streets {{and move it}} underground to places distant from populated areas. Sewage treatment became necessary as population expanded, but treatment of diluted waste from <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> is more expensive than treating undiluted sewage.|$|R
50|$|Early <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> used {{surface runoff}} to dilute waste from toilets {{and carry it}} away from urban areas into natural waterways. Sewage {{treatment}} can remove some pollutants from toilet waste, but treatment of diluted flow from <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> produces larger volumes of treated sewage with similar pollutant concentrations. Modern sanitary sewers are designed to transport domestic and industrial wastewater directly to treatment facilities without dilution.|$|R
5|$|Issues {{that affect}} water {{supply in the}} United States include {{droughts}} in the West, water scarcity, pollution, a backlog of investment, concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall {{as a result of}} climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows.|$|E
5|$|A 1991 {{agreement}} between the City of Portland and the State of Oregon to dramatically reduce <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows (CSOs) led to Portland's Big Pipe Project. The project, part of a related series of Portland CSO projects completed in late 2011 {{at a cost of}} $1.44billion, separates the city's sanitary sewer lines from storm-water inputs that sometimes overwhelmed the combined system during heavy rains. When that occurred, some of the raw sewage in the system flowed into the river instead of into the city's wastewater treatment plant. The Big Pipe project and related work reduces CSO volume on the lower river by about 94percent.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} of sewage contamination, including sewer odors and debris, in the lower reaches of Nanticoke Creek. The city of Nanticoke has a permit to discharge sewage into the creek. Four <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows {{are present in the}} watershed. Orange sediment is deposited on the creek's streambed, indicating a high concentration of iron in the waters. Yellow boy is also present along the creek in some places and can be seen from South Cross Valley Expressway. The concentration of total dissolved solids in the creek is 622 milligrams per liter, higher than the United States Environmental Protection Agency criterion for suitability for aquatic life.|$|E
50|$|Some storm drains lead to {{a mixing}} of {{stormwater}} (rainwater) with sewage, either intentionally - {{in the case of}} <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> - or unintentionally.|$|R

5|$|Some {{reaches of}} Keyser Creek {{experience}} total flow loss {{and there is}} no regular flow in the watershed's lower reaches. There are also extensive piles of culm and silts piled up in the creek's floodplain, left over from the coal mining era. There is at least one sanitary sewer overflow in the watershed. As of 2013, there are an estimated four stormwater detention facilities in the watershed. The creek has no perennial flow, since it loses flow to mine pools during dry weather. For this reason, it is unlikely to attain its designated uses. However, it still has flow during storms. During storm flows, the creek carries large amounts of sediment containing coal waste. Additionally, there are some discharges of rusty water into the creek, in addition to a <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflow.|$|E
25|$|During high {{precipitation}} periods a <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> {{system may}} experience a <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflow event, which forces untreated sewage to flow directly to receiving waters. This can pose {{a serious threat}} to public health and the surrounding environment.|$|E
25|$|POTWs with {{combined}} sewers {{are required to}} comply with the national <b>Combined</b> <b>Sewer</b> Overflow Control Policy, published by EPA in 1994. The policy requires municipalities to make improvements to reduce or eliminate overflow-related pollution problems. About 860 communities in the US have <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> systems, serving about 40 million people.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: PVC {{sanitary}} sewer installation. Sanitary sewers are sized {{to carry the}} amount of sewage generated by the collection area. Sanitary sewers are much smaller than <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> designed to also carry surface runoff.|$|R
50|$|Storm drains are {{typically}} at shallower depths than combined sewers; because, while storm drains {{are designed to}} accept surface runoff from streets, <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> were designed to also accept sewage flows from buildings with basements.|$|R
50|$|A {{well-known}} urban legend, {{the sewer}} alligator, {{is that of}} giant alligators or crocodiles residing in <b>combined</b> <b>sewers,</b> especially of major metropolitan areas. Two public sculptures in New York depict an alligator dragging a hapless victim into a manhole.|$|R
25|$|A {{combination}} {{of public and}} private initiatives helped drastically lower levels of pollutants by focusing on eliminating <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows and storm water runoff. Since Weld's stunt, the river's condition has improved dramatically, although it was not deemed entirely swimmable by 2005.|$|E
25|$|Ferndale's first sewage {{treatment}} facility and <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> system {{was built in}} 1953 and upgraded in 1973, 1994 and 2001. Improvements {{were made to the}} sewers in 1989 under a $400,000 project funded by the California State Water Resources Control Board to improve the collection system and reduce inflow and infiltration.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, an {{investigation}} {{conducted by the}} BBC's Panorama concluded that the operation of more than 20,000 <b>Combined</b> <b>Sewer</b> Overflow pipes (CSO) was leading to the routine spillage of untreated wastes around Britain's coastline, potentially leading to very dirty water around {{some of the most}} popular beaches in the UK. The CSOs, intended for use in very rare occasions, were not covered by the existing legislation for waste emissions.|$|E
50|$|Sewers {{that were}} built {{in the early stages of}} {{urbanization}} were usually built before sewage treatment was implemented. Early sewers were simple drainage systems to remove surface runoff with any waste material it might contain. These drainage systems became <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> when sewage from kitchens, baths, and toilets was added; and the discharge became offensive. Early sewage treatment plants were built to treat the sewage during dry weather; but it was infeasible to treat the larger volume of mixed sewage and precipitation runoff from <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> during wet weather. Sanitary sewers were built to keep sewage from being mixed with surface runoff so the sewage could be efficiently treated during both wet and dry weather.|$|R
25|$|It {{can also}} {{refer to a}} graph showing the volume of water {{reaching}} a particular outfall, or location in a sewerage network. Graphs are commonly used {{in the design of}} sewerage, more specifically, the design of surface water sewerage systems and <b>combined</b> <b>sewers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{centralized}} {{sanitation infrastructure}} in the U.S. consists of 1.2 million miles of sewers—including both sanitary <b>sewers</b> and <b>combined</b> <b>sewers,</b> sewage pumping stations and 16,024 publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. In addition, at least 17% of Americans {{are served by}} on-site sanitation systems such as septic tanks.|$|R
25|$|During the 2000s, {{the city}} {{continued}} investing heavily in infrastructure projects, including {{two of the}} largest building projects in the city's history: the $1.1 billion Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal and $720 million Lucas Oil Stadium, both opened in 2008. A $275 million expansion of the Indiana Convention Center was completed in 2011. Construction began that year on DigIndy, a $1.9 billion project to correct the city's <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows (CSOs) by 2025.|$|E
25|$|Waste {{containing}} unusually low BOD concentrations {{may fail}} to sustain the secondary treatment population required for normal waste concentrations. The reduced population surviving the starvation event {{may be unable to}} completely utilize available BOD when waste loads return to normal. Dilution may be caused by addition of large volumes of relatively uncontaminated water such as stormwater runoff into a <b>combined</b> <b>sewer.</b> Smaller sewage treatment plants may experience dilution from cooling water discharges, major plumbing leaks, firefighting, or draining large swimming pools.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, the Red Hook Treatment Plant was opened, {{diverting}} more sewage {{input from}} the canal. This $375 million plant collected waste from the existing Bond Street sewer and brought the total of <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflow (CSO) points {{in the city to}} 14. With the opening of the new plant, the last dry-weather discharge into a New York City waterway ended, and the CSO points now only function during rain storms. The flushing tunnel was fixed, its fan having reversed direction, in 1999.|$|E
50|$|Sanitary sewage solids {{can either}} {{go through the}} system or settle out in laminar flow {{portions}} of the sewer to be available for washout during peak flows. The wetted perimeter of sewers may also be colonized by biofilm nourished by soluble sanitary wastes. Hydraulic design is the underlying reason for solids deposition in <b>sewers.</b> <b>Combined</b> <b>sewers</b> sized for peak runoff events expected once a decade can carry up to 1,000 times the average sanitary flow. Less dramatically oversized sewers are common in new developments and near the upstream end of collection systems. Suspended solids may accumulate when low-flow fluid velocities generate insufficient turbulence. Solids deposition is greatest where velocities are low during dry weather. In large <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> it may be impossible to attain sanitary sewage velocities generating sufficient turbulence to keep solids suspended during dry weather.|$|R
5000|$|Availability of {{reliable}} pumps allows lifting accumulations {{of water into}} gravity sewers from collection sumps in excavations like mines or building foundations; {{but the cost of}} pumping surface runoff discourages use of lift stations in storm drains or <b>combined</b> <b>sewers.</b> The capitalized cost of operation and maintenance of lift stations and emergency power supplies usually justifies considerable first cost for excavation or tunneling to build a gravity sewer. Sewage treatment is most efficient at centralized locations; and pumping is often required to lift sewage from lower elevations to the sewage treatment plant headworks. Structures called regulators allow overflow into gravity outfall sewers when peak flow in <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> exceeds pumping capacity. Sanitary sewers are preferred for cost-effective pumping of sewage when treatment is required. Gravity sewers are preferred where grades are favorable, but lift stations often move sewage to sewage treatment plants.|$|R
25|$|Portugal {{does not}} yet fully comply with EU {{regulations}} on wastewater discharges. Even where wastewater treatment plants exist they do not always function properly. Especially in cities with <b>combined</b> <b>sewers,</b> treatment plants do not function properly after heavy rains. Sewer overflows during heavy rains are frequent, partly due to unauthorized storm water drain connections to the sewer system.|$|R
25|$|In early 2006, {{the problem}} of {{wastewater}} management arose during a controversy over a planned arena for the Brooklyn Nets in nearby downtown Brooklyn. The project at that point, now called Pacific Park, was to include a basketball arena and 17 skyscrapers, with the resulting sewage would flow into antiquated combined sewers that can overflow when it rains. The Gowanus Canal has 14 <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflow points, so {{the fear is that}} the additional wastewater from the arena would lead to more frequent overflows in the canal.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} sanitation {{technology in}} urban areas is the collection of wastewater in gravity driven sewers, its treatment in wastewater treatment plants for reuse or disposal in rivers, lakes or the sea. Sewers are either combined with storm drains or separated from them as sanitary sewers. Combined sewers are usually found in the central, older parts or urban areas. Heavy rainfall and inadequate maintenance can lead to <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows or sanitary sewer overflows, i.e., more or less diluted raw sewage being discharged into the environment. Industries often discharge wastewater into municipal sewers, which can complicate wastewater treatment unless industries pre-treat their discharges.|$|E
25|$|The {{quality of}} water and {{sanitation}} services in England and Wales is regularly and comprehensively monitored by the economic regulator, OFWAT. OFWAT statistics show that service quality has improved since the early 1990s, i.e. shortly after services were privatised. For example, the number of unplanned interruptions, properties at risk of low pressure, the share of complaints that were not answered within five days and <b>combined</b> <b>sewer</b> overflows have all declined, while sewage treatment works compliance has increased and river water quality has improved. A comparison with service quality {{in other areas of}} the European Union is difficult, since in few other countries such comprehensive water and sanitation service quality data are being published as it is being done by OFWAT.|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of deposits in <b>combined</b> <b>sewers</b> is of vital importance from a technical and management point of view. In <b>combined</b> <b>sewers,</b> {{there are a}} wide range of shape of cross-sections that have not been characterised from a hydraulic aspect and where it is difficult to measure accurately the near wall velocity and shear stress. A research programme, therefore, is in progress to study how flows behave in such channels and the numerical simulations can be used systematically to investigate some parameters viz. velocity field, shear stress. In the present study, a numerical method was employed to compute distribution of shear stress in whole of the cross sections. The effect of turbulence modelling in simple and combined cross section was investigated. A comparison between one-dimensional and three-dimensional flow equations was carried out to estimate distribution of the shear stress. The three-dimensional model results were in close agreement with experimental data, whereas one-dimensional equations could not fit with experimental values...|$|R
50|$|A {{flow control}} {{structure}} is {{a device that}} alters {{the flow of water}} in a stream, drainage channel or pipe. As a group these are passive structures since they operate without intervention under different amounts of water flow and their impact changes based on the quantity of water available. This includes weirs, flow splitters and proprietary-design devices that are used for stormwater management and in <b>combined</b> <b>sewers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Effluent sewer {{systems are}} {{a much less}} common sewage {{disposal}} method than gravity sewer systems that use gravity, as well as pumping where needed, to send raw sewage and other wastewater straight from consumers to a sewage treatment plant. There are two main types of gravity <b>sewers,</b> sanitary and <b>combined.</b> Sanitary <b>sewers</b> only treat the wastewater from homes and business. <b>Combined</b> <b>sewers</b> have storm drains that {{are connected to the}} sewerage. In areas with high rainfall, this results in an enormous additional amount of wastewater that has to be treated. <b>Combined</b> <b>sewers</b> have higher operating costs due to the larger volume of wastewater that has to be treated, and they may require larger treatment plants, as well. In addition, when it rains very hard, the treatment plant {{will not be able to}} keep up, which can result in untreated wastewater being dumped into the plant's outfall, which may be a river, lake or ocean. When this occurs, the operator of the sewer is usually fined by one or more of the government bodies that oversee the body of water that the wastewater was dumped into. To prevent this, some cities have tanks, pits or ponds to store the excess wastewater until it can be properly treated. To prevent groundwater contamination, the pits and ponds should have liners if sewage has already been combined with the storm runoff.|$|R
