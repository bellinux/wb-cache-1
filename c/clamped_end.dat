40|$|Abstract. The {{temperature}} of the steel tube of a CFT column rises rapidly upon a fire causing the deterioration of its strength, while the concrete inside of the tube having large heat capacity provides fire-resistance performance. In order to employ CFT columns as fire-resistant structure, {{it is necessary to}} conduct studies on the factors exerting influence on structural capacities and the influence associated with each condition. Concrete’s compressive strength, cross-sectional size, axial load ratio and boundary condition are the major factors which are influential in fire-resistance performance. In particular, boundary condition between columns and beams {{is one of the major}} factors which decide fire-resistance performance because it exerts influence on load carrying capacity. The result of the test conducted in this study showed that fire-resistance time of 106 minutes was secured in the specimens with <b>clamped</b> <b>ends</b> and that of 89 minutes in those with pinned ends when cross-sectional size was 360 by 360.

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of a cantilever beam to imposed {{displacement of the}} <b>clamped</b> <b>end</b> is analyzed.

In this study, both analytical prediction and experimental investigation are implemented to eval-uate the effectiveness of active control of flexural vibration of the handlebars of a bicycle by using MFC actuators. The handlebars are simulated as a cantilevered hollow cylindrical rod surface-bonded with three flexible MFC actuators, two placed at the <b>clamped</b> <b>end</b> and the third at the bent location subjected to flexural vibration transmitted from a head tube.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a complete and}} asymptotic representation of the one-dimensional nanobeam model with nonlocal stress via an exact variational principle approach. An asymptotic governing differential equation of infinite-order strain gradient model and the corresponding infinite number of boundary conditions are derived and discussed. For practical applications, it explores and presents a reduced higher-order solution to the asymptotic nonlocal model. It is also identified here and explained at length that most publications on this subject have inaccurately employed an excessively simplified lower-order model which furnishes intriguing solutions under certain loading and boundary conditions where the results become identical to the classical solution, i. e., without the small-scale effect at all. Various nanobeam examples are solved to demonstrate the difference between using the simplified lower-order nonlocal model and the asymptotic higher-order strain gradient nonlocal stress model. An important conclusion is the discovery of significant over- or underestimation of stress levels using the lower-order model, particularly at {{the vicinity of the}} <b>clamped</b> <b>end</b> of a cantilevered nanobeam under a tip point load. The consequence is that the design of a nanobeam based on the lower-order strain gradient model could be flawed in predicting the nonlocal stress at the <b>clamped</b> <b>end</b> where it could, depending on the magnitude of the small-scale parameter, significantly over- or underestimate the failure criteria of a nanobeam which are governed by the level of stress...|$|E
40|$|Shells are {{structures}} {{designed to}} cover wide areas without internal supports. This type of structure can survive extreme loads, {{and has been}} used since antiquity. Modern applications include aircraft, spacecraft, pressure vessels, storage tanks and cooling towers. In this paper, dynamic stiffness equations are formulated for tapered cylindrical shells, under the assumptions of Donnell, Timoshenko and Flügge theories. These are transformed to governing ordinary differential equations of order eight, which are solved numerically using the boundary-value solver COLSYS [1], enabling the assembly of the dynamic stiffness matrix. Natural frequencies are found by solving the resulting transcendental eigenvalue problem using the Wittrick-Williams algorithm [2]. This algorithm requires knowledge {{of the number of}} <b>clamped</b> <b>end</b> natural frequencies exceeded at any trial value of the eigenparameter. The paper presents and validates a new method, based on the recently discovered "member stiffness determinant" [3], for dividing the shell into a sufficient number of smaller elements, so as to ensure that all their <b>clamped</b> <b>end</b> natural frequencies exceed the highest frequency of interest. Good agreement is obtained with previously published natural frequencies for constant and variable thickness cylindrical shells. A parametric study is performed, using the Donnell theory, to examine the natural frequencies of shells with linear and quadratic, asymmetrically and symmetrically tapered axial variation of thickness. The study considers the effects of varying the ratios of length to radius and radius to thickness, and covers clamped-clamped, simply supported and cantilevered end conditions. Increasing the amount of thickness variation decreases the natural frequencies in the case of asymmetric taper, but increases them in cases of symmetric taper. Natural frequencies decrease as the length to radius and radius to thickness ratios increase. For cantilevered end conditions, the natural frequencies increase if material is concentrated at the <b>clamped</b> <b>end</b> of the shell. Solution times appear to be competitive, and there is no loss of accuracy for higher natural frequencies because an exact formulation is used. The method could be further developed to find the natural frequencies and critical buckling loads of orthotropic and anisotropic shells, and shells with varying radius, e. g. conical and spherical shells, and domes...|$|E
