5|$|The Algoman orogeny {{occurred}} 2800 to , and {{it marks}} {{the end of}} the crust-building Archean Eon. There were several episodes of <b>continental</b> <b>collision,</b> compression and subduction which resulted in mountain building during this time. Orogenic events are characterized by extensive metaphorism, granitic extrusions and unconformities. The Algoman orogeny added landmass along a border from South Dakota to the Lake Huron region; this boundary is the Great Lakes tectonic zone (GLTZ).|$|E
5|$|The Mendip Hills are {{the most}} southerly Carboniferous Limestone upland in Britain. The rock strata known as the Carboniferous Limestone were laid down during the early Carboniferous Period, about 320–350million years ago. Subsequently, much of northwestern Europe {{underwent}} <b>continental</b> <b>collision</b> throughout the late Paleozoic Era, culminating in the final phases of the Variscan orogeny {{near the end of}} the Carboniferous, 300million years ago. This tectonic activity produced a complex suite of mountain and hill ranges across what is now southern Ireland, south-western England, Brittany, and elsewhere in western Europe.|$|E

50|$|However, some <b>continental</b> <b>collisions</b> are {{far more}} complex than this, and the region {{may not be in}} {{isostatic}} equilibrium, so this subject has to be treated with caution.|$|R
25|$|Slab {{rollback}} is {{not always}} a continuous process suggesting an episodic nature. The episodic nature of the rollback is explained by a change in the density of the subducting plate, such as the arrival of buoyant lithosphere (a continent, arc, ridge, or plateau), a change in the subduction dynamics, or a change in the plate kinematics. The age of the subducting plates does not have any effect on slab rollback. Nearby <b>continental</b> <b>collisions</b> have an effect on slab rollback. <b>Continental</b> <b>collisions</b> induce mantle flow and extrusion of mantle material, which causes stretching and arc-trench rollback. In the area of the Southeast Pacific, there have been several rollback events resulting in the formation of numerous back-arc basins.|$|R
5|$|The northeastern part of Iran lies across part of {{the belt}} of active <b>continental</b> <b>collision</b> between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Iran is crossed by several major faults, with 90% of them being seismically active and subject to many {{earthquakes}} each year; {{the area around the}} rupture experiences minor quakes almost daily. The most seismically active parts of this area are the Zagros fold and thrust belt and the Alborz mountain range. Qazvin Province, which is located between these two zones, suffers less earthquakes, but these may be more powerful because stresses have longer to build.|$|E
5|$|The {{area where}} Armenia lies is of {{interest}} to seismologists and geologists because of the relatively early stage of <b>continental</b> <b>collision</b> occurring there and because the earthquake's strong aftershock sequence and significant surface faulting presented scientists with an environment to study reverse faulting. Twelve days after the mainshock a French-Soviet team installed a temporary seismic network in the epicentral area to record aftershock activity (a separate expedition from the United States also visited the site). The initial portion of work included nearly a full week setting up the seismometers and optimizing their operation and, with that complete, two full weeks of continuous operation was then completed with twenty six seismometers covering an area over 1500 square kilometers. The final stage concluded with seven weeks (through the end of February 1989) of continued monitoring with a reduced capacity of twenty units.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the large}} shift, {{the change in}} {{direction}} was never recorded by magnetic declinations, fracture zone orientations or plate reconstructions; nor could a <b>continental</b> <b>collision</b> have occurred fast enough to produce such a pronounced bend in the chain. To test {{whether or not the}} bend was a result of a change in direction of the Pacific Plate, scientists analyzed the lava samples' geochemistry to determine where and when they formed. Age was determined by the radiometric dating of radioactive isotopes of potassium and argon. Researchers estimated that the volcanoes formed during a period 81 million to 45 million years ago. Tarduno and his team determined where the volcanoes formed by analyzing the rock for the magnetic mineral magnetite. While hot lava from a volcanic eruption cools, tiny grains within the magnetite align with the Earth's magnetic field, and lock in place once the rock solidifies. Researchers were able to verify the latitudes at which the volcanoes formed by measuring the grains' orientation within the magnetite. Paleomagnetists concluded that the Hawaiian hotspot had drifted southward sometime in its history, and that, 47 million years ago, the hotspot's southward motion greatly slowed, perhaps even stopping entirely.|$|E

50|$|Tectonically, lithic {{sandstones}} often form in a {{wide variety}} sedimentary depositional environments (including fluvial, deltaic, and alluvial sediments) associated with active margins. This tectonic setting provides the source of the lithic fragments, either through arc volcanism, thin-skinned faulting, <b>continental</b> <b>collisions,</b> unroofing, and subduction roll-back.|$|R
5|$|The Mendip Hills, {{of which}} Brean Down forms the most {{westerly}} part, {{are the most}} southerly Carboniferous Limestone upland in Britain.

Subsequently, much of northwestern Europe underwent <b>continental</b> <b>collision</b> throughout the late Paleozoic era, culminating in the final phases of the Variscan orogeny {{near the end of}} the Carboniferous period, 300million years ago. This tectonic activity produced a complex suite of mountain and hill ranges across what is now southern Ireland, south-western England, Brittany, and elsewhere in western Europe. As a result of the Variscan mountain-building, the Mendip area now comprises at least four anticlinal fold structures, with an east-west trend, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. West of the main Mendip plateau the Carboniferous Limestone continues in Bleadon Hill and Brean Down, and on the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Continental</b> <b>collision</b> is a {{phenomenon}} of the plate tectonics of Earth that occurs at convergent boundaries. <b>Continental</b> <b>collision</b> is {{a variation on the}} fundamental process of subduction, whereby the subduction zone is destroyed, mountains produced, and two continents sutured together. <b>Continental</b> <b>collision</b> is known only to occur on Earth.|$|E

5000|$|The area we {{now call}} the North Sea was {{interspersed}} amid several separate continental areas (Siberia, Baltica, Gondwana, and Laurentia) {{as well as the}} Iapetus Ocean and Tornquist Sea.

25|$|During the Late Archean Era the Algoman orogeny added landmass to the Superior {{province}} by {{volcanic activity}} and <b>continental</b> <b>collision</b> along a boundary {{that stretches from}} present-day South Dakota, U.S., into the Lake Huron region near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.|$|E
25|$|From late Carboniferous times, {{through the}} Permian, South Wales {{lay on the}} {{northern}} margin of the Variscan orogen, an area affected by a complex <b>continental</b> <b>collision</b> taking place to the south. The most intensely affected rocks are those of south and central Pembrokeshire where steeply dipping and vertical strata are commonplace and multiple folding, faulting and overthrusting are well seen in coastal sections. Southern Carmarthenshire and {{the western part of}} the South Wales Coalfield was affected to a lesser extent. Old Caledonoid weaknesses such as the Neath Disturbance were reactivated at this time.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of Pannotia began during the Pan-African orogeny when the Congo continent got {{caught between the}} northern and southern halves of the previous supercontinent Rodinia some 750 Ma. The peak in this mountain building event was around 640-610 Ma, but these <b>continental</b> <b>collisions</b> may have continued into the Early Cambrian some 530 Ma. The {{formation of}} Pannotia was the result of Rodinia turning itself inside out.|$|R
5000|$|When continents collide, the {{continental}} crust may thicken at their edges in the collision. If this happens, {{much of the}} thickened crust may move downwards rather than up as with the iceberg analogy. The idea of <b>continental</b> <b>collisions</b> building mountains [...] "up" [...] is therefore rather a simplification. Instead, the crust thickens and {{the upper part of}} the thickened crust may become a mountain range.|$|R
40|$|U/Pb {{detrital}} zircon ages {{from global}} modern river sediments define eight peak clusters centered at 2700, 2500, 2010, 1840, 1600, 1150, 600, and 300 Ma. These clusters extend vertically into {{both positive and}} negative εHf(T) space and are similar to those in orogenic granitoids that correlate well with supercontinent formation. We suggest that the clusters are preservation peaks that reflect juvenile and reworked continental crust selectively preserved during <b>continental</b> <b>collisions.</b> The greatest contribution of juvenile continental crust is associated with the 1600 and 1150 Ma clusters and may reflect a change in the style of collisional orogens in the Paleoproterozoic involving thicker and stronger lithosphere. Age gaps at 2400 - 2200, 1400 - 1300, 900 - 650, and 185 - 120 Ma represent times when crustal production and recycling rates were about the same. Although some new continental growth may occur during <b>continental</b> <b>collisions,</b> supercontinent assembly does not require an increase in production rate of continental crust. Rather, we suggest that the preservation rate increases by an increased probability of capture of both new and reworked continental crust in collisional orogens. 7 page(s...|$|R
25|$|The {{tectonics}} of Iran {{are dominated}} by the <b>continental</b> <b>collision</b> of the Arabian and Eurasian Plates. The rate of convergence has been estimated at two centimeters per {{year for the past}} 10 million years; about half of that occurs across the Zagros fold and thrust belt. The northern Iran region near the Alborz mountains contains numerous reverse and left-lateral strike-slip faults that lie to the south of the Caspian sea. The Astaneh strike-slip fault was a likely source of the 856 Damghan earthquake that caused the largest loss of life in the history of Iran—more than 200,000 deaths.|$|E
25|$|The {{geological}} {{structure of}} Poland {{has been shaped}} by the <b>continental</b> <b>collision</b> of Europe and Africa over the past 60million years and, more recently, by the Quaternary glaciations of northern Europe. Both processes shaped the Sudetes and the Carpathian Mountains. The moraine landscape of northern Poland contains soils made up mostly of sand or loam, while the ice age river valleys of the south often contain loess. The Polish Jura, the Pieniny, and the Western Tatras consist of limestone, while the High Tatras, the Beskids, and the Karkonosze are made up mainly of granite and basalts. The Polish Jura Chain {{has some of the}} oldest rock formation on the continent of Europe.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most highly {{deformed}} ultramafic rocks which underwent laterization are found in the complex Precambrian shields in Brazil and Australia. Smaller highly deformed Alpine-type intrusives have formed laterite profiles in Guatemala, Colombia, Central Europe, India and Burma. Large thrust sheets of Mesozoic to Tertiary 251- to 65-million-year-old island arcs and <b>continental</b> <b>collision</b> zones underwent laterization in New Caledonia, Cuba, Indonesia and the Philippines. Laterites reflect past weathering conditions; laterites which are found in present-day non-tropical areas are products of former geological epochs, when that area was near the equator. Present-day laterite occurring outside the humid tropics are considered to be indicators of climatic change, continental drift or a combination of both.|$|E
50|$|These {{conditions}} {{exist in}} the orogenic belts that result from either two <b>continental</b> tectonic <b>collisions</b> or from subduction zone accretion.|$|R
50|$|The high {{mountain}} ranges produced by <b>continental</b> <b>collisions</b> are immediately {{subjected to the}} forces of erosion. Erosion wears down the mountains and massive piles of sediment are developed in adjacent ocean margins, shallow seas, and as continental deposits. As these sediment piles are buried deeper they become lithified into sedimentary rock. The metamorphic, igneous, and sedimentary rocks of the mountains become the new piles of sediments in the adjoining basins and eventually become sedimentary rock.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Continental</b> <b>collisions</b> are a {{critical}} part of the supercontinent cycle and have happened many times in the past. Ancient collision zones are deeply eroded but may still be recognized because these mark sites of intense deformation, metamorphism, and plutonic activity that separate tracts of continental crust having different geologic histories prior to the collision. Old collision zones are commonly called [...] "suture zones" [...] by geologists, because this is where two previous continents are joined or sutured together.|$|R
25|$|After the {{break-up}} of Rodinia about 800Ma, the continents may have formed another short-lived supercontinent around 550Ma. The hypothetical supercontinent is {{sometimes referred to}} as Pannotia or Vendia. The evidence for it is a phase of <b>continental</b> <b>collision</b> known as the Pan-African orogeny, which joined the continental masses of current-day Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia. The existence of Pannotia depends on the timing of the rifting between Gondwana (which included most of the landmass now in the Southern Hemisphere, as well as the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent) and Laurentia (roughly equivalent to current-day North America). It is at least certain {{that by the end of}} the Proterozoic eon, most of the continental mass lay united in a position around the south pole.|$|E
25|$|A third type of basin exists along {{convergent}} plate boundaries – {{places where}} one tectonic plate moves under another into the asthenosphere. The subducting plate bends and forms a fore-arc basin {{in front of}} the overriding plate—an elongated, deep asymmetric basin. Fore-arc basins are filled with deep marine deposits and thick sequences of turbidites. Such infill is called flysch. When the convergent movement of the two plates results in <b>continental</b> <b>collision,</b> the basin becomes shallower and develops into a foreland basin. At the same time, tectonic uplift forms a mountain belt in the overriding plate, from which large amounts of material are eroded and transported to the basin. Such erosional material of a growing mountain chain is called molasse and has either a shallow marine or a continental facies.|$|E
25|$|The Carboniferous {{was a time}} {{of active}} {{mountain}} building, as the supercontinent Pangea came together. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America-Europe (Laurussia) along the present line of eastern North America. This <b>continental</b> <b>collision</b> resulted in the Hercynian orogeny in Europe, and the Alleghenian orogeny in North America; it also extended the newly uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the Ouachita Mountains. In the same time frame, much of present eastern Eurasian plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the Ural mountains. There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous the Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed the Rheic Ocean (closed by the assembly of South and North America), the small, shallow Ural Ocean (which was closed by the collision of Baltica, and Siberia continents, creating the Ural Mountains) and Proto-Tethys Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The geology of Massachusetts is {{the result}} of a process that began over a billion years ago. Massachusetts {{currently}} lies at an edge of a continent, and in the geological past has been the location of many <b>continental</b> <b>collisions</b> and collisions with other microcontinents and volcanic arcs, with their resulting mountain-building events. As a result, the state rock structure is squeezed together. Recently, multiple Ice Ages have shaped the modern geology of the state and have created notable landmarks such as Cape Cod.|$|R
25|$|Great Britain {{has been}} subject {{to a variety of}} plate tectonic {{processes}} over a very extended period of time. Changing latitude and sea levels have been important factors in the nature of sedimentary sequences, whilst successive <b>continental</b> <b>collisions</b> have affected its geological structure with major faulting and folding being a legacy of each orogeny (mountain-building period), often associated with volcanic activity and the metamorphism of existing rock sequences. As a result of this eventful geological history, the island shows a rich variety of landscapes.|$|R
50|$|According to some authors, the Caledonian <b>continental</b> <b>collisions</b> {{involved}} another microcontinent, Armorica (southern Portugal, most of {{the north}} of France and parts of southern Germany and the Czech Republic), even smaller than Avalonia. This microcontinent probably did not form one consistent unit, but was instead a series of fragments, of which the current Armorican and Bohemian Massifs are the most important. The ocean between the combined continental mass of Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia (called Euramerica, Laurussia or Old Red Continent) and Armorica is called the Rheic Ocean.|$|R
