Although the earliest cat fatality from the H1N1 virus in the U.S. occurred in Pennsylvania, the Oregon Veterinary Medical Association {{was the first to}} confirm a cat fatality in the U.S. The association recommends that <b>cat</b> owners with <b>flu</b> symptoms avoid touching cat's eyes, nose, and mouth while sick. Thoroughly wash your hands after handling a sick pet since it may be possible for cats to transmit the virus to humans. This is the third confirmed case of H1N1 in a cat in the U.S.; other cases have occurred in Utah and Iowa. The first case of a dog with H1N1 was reported in December 2009. On July 22, 2011 the Norwegian Veterinary Institute reported the first occurrence of 2009-H1N1 influenza virus in minks.|$|R

50|$|Influenza infects many animal species, and {{transfer}} of viral strains between species can occur. Birds {{are thought to}} be the main animal reservoirs of influenza viruses. Sixteen forms of hemagglutinin and nine forms of neuraminidase have been identified. All known subtypes (HxNy) are found in birds, but many subtypes are endemic in humans, dogs, horses, and pigs; populations of camels, ferrets, cats, seals, mink, and whales also show evidence of prior infection or exposure to influenza. Variants of flu virus are sometimes named according to the species the strain is endemic in or adapted to. The main variants named using this convention are: bird flu, human flu, swine flu, horse flu and dog flu. (<b>Cat</b> <b>flu</b> generally refers to feline viral rhinotracheitis or feline calicivirus and not infection from an influenza virus.) In pigs, horses and dogs, influenza symptoms are similar to humans, with cough, fever and loss of appetite. The frequency of animal diseases are not as well-studied as human infection, but an outbreak of influenza in harbor seals caused approximately 500 seal deaths off the New England coast in 1979-1980. However, outbreaks in pigs are common and do not cause severe mortality. Vaccines have also been developed to protect poultry from avian influenza. These vaccines can be effective against multiple strains and are used either as part of a preventative strategy, or combined with culling in attempts to eradicate outbreaks.|$|E
40|$|Feline Influenza Virus (FInV) and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) are two {{important}} viruses causing <b>cat</b> <b>flu</b> and neoplastic disease {{all over the}} world, respectively but to the knowledge, there is no epidemiological survey report available for these two killer diseases in cat in Bangladesh.

For this purpose, a total 60 randomly selected cats consisting of 48 pet and 12 stray cats at Tangail district in Bangladesh during May to October, 2009 were used. Nasal swab and blood sample were collected from all cats and tested by commercial rapid RapiGEN® Feline Influenza Virus (FInV) Ag Test kit and RapiGEN® Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) Ag Test kit, respectively following the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s (RapiGEN Inc., Korea) instructions.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to (a) identify the pathogenic agent causing symptoms in the upper respiratory tract using clinical examination only, (b) determine the agreement between clinical examination and laboratory diagnostics, (c) evaluate the use of lissamine green dye in the diagnosis of a feline herpes viral infection and (d) determine the interobserver reliability between a qualified veterinarian and an ophthalmologic specialist. 99 cats with upper respiratory tract symptoms were clinically examined; simultaneously, a sample for laboratory analyses using real time PCR was taken. 22 of these 99 animals were individually examined by the vet and the specialist, with only the specialist using a slit-lamp biomicroscope and the veterinarian using common methods for examination used by practitioners. All 99 cats showed clinical symptoms of <b>cat</b> <b>flu.</b> The PCR determined a pathogenic agent in 63 of them. In 57 cats, the veterinarian diagnosed only one causing agent (monoinfection) whilst in 42 cats the symptoms indicated a mixed infection caused by multiple pathogenic agents. The PCR also detected a monoinfection in 40 cats and a mixed infection in 23. The veterinarian diagnosed a feline herpes viral infection in 33 of the cats and in 45. 5 % (15 / 33 animals), the diagnosis was supported by the results of the PCR. Another 33 cats were diagnosed with the feline calicivirus and in 91. 0 % (30 / 33) the PCR also detected the feline calicivirus. Five of these 33 cats showed signs of massive conjunctivae ulceration whilst another two cats had plaque-like deposits on the conjunctiva. A Chlamydophila felis infection was diagnosed by the veterinarian in 63 animals and supported by the PCR result in 23 animals (36. 5 %). The veterinarian diagnosed 27 cats with an infection caused by Mycoplasma felis, and was supported by a positive PCR for this agent in 66. 6 % (18 / 27) of these animals. The diagnosis of feline herpes virus and feline calicivirus by only using clinical symptoms is well established and was proved to be successful in this clinical study. The pathognomic symptoms of Chlamydophila felis and Mycoplasma felis are not particularly well suited for differentiating between the two agents. It was noted that the ulcerative lesions caused by a feline calicivirus infection were usually limited to the oral cavity, tongue margins hard palate, tonsils and lungs, and this also seemed to be conjunctivally pathogenic in our study. Therefore, it can be assumed that not only the feline herpes virus causes viral conjunctivitis in cats. The findings by the veterinarian and the specialist were largely consistent with each other and it was observed that a practising veterinarian is able to identify the pathogenic agent causing the symptoms in upper respiratory tract infections. Furthermore, {{there seemed to be no}} advantage in using a slit lamp biomicroscope. Lissamine green was shown to be useful for the visualisation of ulcerations and fine dendritic or punctual lesions in the cornea at the early stage of a herpes virus infection. It was not possible to visualise the dendritic corneal lesions using fluorescein. Also lissamine green proved to be uncomplicated in its application. As a final conclusion of this study it should be noted that the different agents of the <b>cat</b> <b>flu</b> can be well determined by clinical examination...|$|E
40|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} domestic cat is Felis silvestris forma catus Linnaeus, 1758. The historically earliest findings of cats in connection with human beings were made in Jericho (approx. 800 B. C.) and Anatolia (approx. 6000 B. C.). In both cases it was in mud cottage villages in which people lived in large, stable communities. The growing of wild corn in the surroundings of the villages {{made it possible for}} cats to exist. Most likely local wild cats settled in these farm villages and because of their usefulness were tamed and finally domesticated. However, only assumptions may be made in this respect. The parallel appearance of cats on the Greek islands, Egypt and Pakistan may be based on the extended trading of the highly civilized cultures as well as a result of analogous domestication. Whether the ancient Egyptian cats were the first domesticated ones, as is commonly believed, is debatable. However, the Egyptians were most likely the first ones who bred cats to a large extend. The African wild cat Felis silvestris libyca Forster, 1780 is mentioned as progenitor in almost every publication, however, we can only be certain that our domestic cat stems from the race Felis silvestris. The domestic cat spread from the area along the Mediteranean Sea to Europe and around 1000 A. D. became a firm part of the European domestic animal world. In Eastern Asia the domestic cat was already known 800 B. C. In the United States of America its existence was first documented in 1626 and in Australia in 1798. Because of its reputation of being an unpredictable beast of prey along with other characteristics the cat was a part of religious acts in the ancient Egypt. This must not be understood as worship of or even love for the cat. The Egyptians killed cats during rituals. The cat was persecuted in every continent. The persecution reached its peak {{under the influence of the}} Christian Church and especially in Germany in the 15 th- 17 th Century the cat was nearly exterminated. Even if the cat in single cases was kept as a pet, the main reason for keeping cats was their participation in pest control. This trait saved the human race from immeasurable economical damage. During the end of the middle age and beginning of the new age the cat was furthermore deliverer of fur, meat and raw materials used for the production of medicine and witch craft. As laboratory animal the cat plays only a minor role. Today, however, its psychohygienic and social role must not be underestimated. The cat plays a large role in public belief as well as in literature and customs. It mainly symbolizes falseness, misfortune, greed and lust. It seldom stands for fortune. This symbolic is contained in animal tales and legends as well as in proverbs and idioms. Nevertheless the cat always has been the muse of many important literary men and performers. In the middle of the 18 th century miscellaneous literature appears for the first time which now and then relates to cat keeping and care, whereby the general opinion was that cats suffer from the same diseases as dogs. Therapy was often neglected because of the cat&# 65533;s resistance and robust constitution. The first specialized book about cat diseases was published in 1925. Thereafter the science about cat diseases developed rapidly and reached its peak in 1996 with the foundation of the European Society for Feline Medicine with more than 700 members world wide. One historically interesting disease of the domestic cat is the rabies as the oldest known infectious disease for which man is susceptible to as well as additional infectious diseases about whose epidemic occurrences historical deliveries exist or those infectious diseases having a large impact on cat population based on their morbidity and mortality. These include Panleukopenia, <b>cat</b> <b>flu,</b> FIP, FIV and the FeLV-Infection. In early publications much attention was paid to the parasitic diseases, mainly the Scabies, especially in regards to its therapy. In 2003 the cat with a number of 6, 9 million was the number one pet in Germany...|$|E
