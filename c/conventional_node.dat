40|$|The {{conduction}} {{tissue in}} a univentricular {{heart of the}} right ventricular type with a right-sided rudimentary chamber was studied. Both an anterior and <b>conventional</b> <b>node</b> were found, the anterior node being positioned in the atrial septum {{very close to the}} <b>conventional</b> <b>node.</b> Between the two nodes, a sling of conduction tissue passed through the annulus fibrosus but was not related to the trabecular septum. A non-branching bundle descended on to a free-running trabecula in the main ventricular chamber, the trabecular septum itself being devoid of conduction tissue. We believe it is likely that this trabecula represents the trabecula septomarginalis of the normal right ventricle. It has recently been suggested that during development the primordium of the trabecula septomarginalis is the structure which carries the conduction tissue from the atrioventricular node (whatever its position) to the trabecular septum.

To improve the interference immunity, PHY/MAC-layer protocols have evolved from competition based to cooperative based transmission and reception. Cooperative wireless communications can actually exploit interference, which includes self-interference and other user interference. In cooperative wireless communications, each node might use self-interference and other user interference to improve the performance of data encoding and decoding, whereas <b>conventional</b> <b>nodes</b> are generally directed to avoid the interference. For example, once strong interference is decodable, a node decodes and cancels the strong interference before decoding the self-signal.

The design space of single-hop interconnections is explored among such stations. Interconnections are presented whose throughput can grow quadratically {{with the number of}} transmitters and receivers per station. These are referred to as selective broadcast interconnections (SBIs). The performance of various SBIs are studied.

40|$|CEC Landran, Mohali, Punjab Abstract- Scientists use wsn {{networks}} for monitoring various environmental parameters. Routing protocols in WSNs emphasize on data dissemination, limited battery power and bandwidth constraints {{in order to}} facilitate efficient working of the network, thereby increasing the lifetime of the network. In several deployment scenarios, it is cumbersome to run cables to power the nodes. Therefore, sensor nodes are often equipped with pre-charged batteries, which supply the energy required for their operations. Over time, the node expends all the energy in its battery and becomes inoperable or dead. Eventually, the network itself fails to meet its sensing objective. Energy harvesting sensor (EHS) nodes provide an attractive and green {{solution to the problem of}} limited lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Unlike a <b>conventional</b> <b>node</b> that uses a non-rechargeable battery and dies once it runs out of energy, an EHS node can harvest energy from the environment and replenish its rechargeable battery. Thus, this paper reviews some of the most efficient routing protocols and briefly discusses the components and architecture of WSN...|$|E

In this paper, {{the effect of}} the FA mechanism on the throughput of wireless local area networks (WLANs) has been investigated. To this end, we propose an analytical model in order to analyze an IEEE 802. 11 n network comprised of an access point (AP) and several <b>conventional</b> <b>nodes</b> (CNs), all in the coverage area of each other. With respect to the heavier download traffic compared to the upload one, in our scenario, only the AP uses an FA mechanism and the other nodes use the basic IEEE 802. 11 standard. In our proposed analytical model, the maximum downlink (DL) throughput is derived. Regarding the asymmetry among nodes, our analytical model consists of two different queueing networks: one for the AP and the other one for CNs. We verify the accuracy of our analytical results by simulations, i. e., less than 5 % mismatch between the analytical and simulation results. We show that there is a tradeoff between the DL saturation throughput and performance of CNs. In other words, the FA improves the AP saturation throughput at the cost of a little degradation of the performance for CNs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Energy {{harvesting}} (EH) is {{an attractive}} and green {{solution to the problem}} of limited lifetime of wireless sensor net-works (WSNs). Unlike a <b>conventional</b> <b>node</b> that dies once it runs out of energy, an EH node harvests energy from the environment and replenishes its rechargeable battery. We investigate a new class of hybrid networks that comprise both EH and conventional nodes and differ from conventional and all-EH WSNs. We pro-pose two new and insightful performance criteria called k-outage duration and n-transmission duration to evaluate these networks. They overcome the pitfalls associated with defining lifetime, which arise because the EH nodes never die but can occasionally run out of energy, and capture the dynamic time evolution, which occurs because the conventional nodes irreversibly drain their batteries. They also account for the inability of the nodes to transmit data due to insufficient battery energy and channel fading. We prove two computationally efficient novel bounds for evaluating these criteria. Our results characterize the effect of the number of EH and conventional nodes and channel fading statistics on these criteria. Further, given a total cost constraint, we determine the conventional and EH node mixture in the network that optimizes these criteria.

Unlike a <b>conventional</b> <b>node</b> that uses a non-rechargeable battery and dies once it runs out of energy, an EHS node can harvest energy from the environment and replenish its rechargeable battery. We consider hybrid WSNs that comprise of both EHS and conventional nodes; these arise when legacy WSNs are upgraded or due to EHS deployment cost issues. We compare conventional and hybrid WSNs on the basis of a new and insightful performance metric called k-outage duration, which captures the inability of the nodes to transmit data either due to lack of sufficient battery energy or wireless fading. The metric overcomes the problem of defining lifetime in networks with EHS nodes, which never die but are occasionally unable to transmit due to lack of sufficient battery energy. It also accounts for the effect of wireless channel fading on the ability of the WSN to transmit data. We develop two novel, tight, and computationally simple bounds for evaluating the k-outage duration. Our results show that increasing the number of EHS nodes has a markedly different effect on the k-outage duration than increasing the number of conventional nodes. I...|$|E
40|$|Multiobjective genetic {{programming}} (MOGP) {{is a powerful}} evolutionary algorithm that requires no human pre-fixed model sets to handle regression and classification problems in the machine learning area. We aim to improve the model generalisation of MOGP in both regression and classification tasks. The work in this thesis has three main contributions. First, we propose replacing the division operator used in {{genetic programming}} with an analytic quotient (AQ) operator in regression to systematically achieve lower mean squared error due principally to removing the discontinuities or singularities caused by conventional protected or unprotected division. Further, this AQ operator is differentiable. Second, we propose using Tikhonov regularisation, in conjunction with node count (using an extension of Pareto comparison from vectors to tuples) as a general complexity measure in MOGP. We demonstrate that employing this general complexity yields mean squared test error measures over a range of regression problems which are typically superior to those from <b>conventional</b> <b>node</b> count. We further analysed the reason why our new method outperforms the conventional complexity measure and conclude that it forms a decision mechanism which balances both syntactic and semantic information. Third, we propose using a loss measure complementary to Vapnik's statistical learning theory, which can effectively stabilise classifiers trained by MOGP. We demonstrate that this loss measure {{has a number of}} attractive properties and has a better correlation with generalisation error compared to 0 / 1 loss, so that better generalisation performance is achievable...|$|E

Compared with <b>conventional</b> <b>node</b> based counterparts, they offer many useful properties. For example, they enforce tangential continuity only on inter-element boundaries but no normal continuity; they allow a vector field separated as {{the sum of the}} gradient of a scalar function and the remaining part. This dissertation presents a magnetic vector potential formulation implemented with edge elements to simulate eddy current phenomenon. The additional degree of freedom associated with the magnetic vector potential is fixed with the help of tree and co-tree separation from graph theory. The validity of the method is verified using well-known benchmark problems.;A phenomenological signal inversion scheme is proposed to characterize defect profiles from eddy current probe signals. The method relies on the edge element based forward model to predict probe responses and a minimization algorithm to minimize an objective function representing the squared error between the modal prediction and the observed signal. A gradient-based minimization algorithm is first investigated. The long computation time associated with the gradient calculation is reduced using the adjoint equation based method. However, gradient-based methods tend to converge to a poorer local minimum. A genetic algorithm and a simulated annealing algorithm are employed to improve performance. The performance of these stochastic methods {{in the context of the}} defect characterization problem is studied. The preliminary results show the effectiveness of the stochastic methods...|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} {{desirable}} {{to calculate the}} electromagnetic fields inside and about a complicated system of scattering bodies, {{as well as in}} their far-field region. The finite element method (FE) is well suited to solving the interior problem, but the domain has to be limited to a manageable size. At the truncation of the FE mesh one can either impose approximate (absorbing) boundary conditions or set up an integral equation (IE) for the fields scattered from the bodies. The latter approach is preferable since it results in higher accuracy. Hence, the two techniques can be successfully combined by introducing a surface that encloses the scatterers, applying a FE model to the inner volume and setting up an IE for the tangential fields components on the surface. Here the continuity of the tangential fields is used bo obtain a consistent solution. A few coupled FE-IE methods have recently appeared in the literature. The approach presented here has the advantage of using edge-based finite elements, a type of finite elements with degrees of freedom associated with edges of the mesh. Because of their properties, they are better suited than the <b>conventional</b> <b>node</b> based elements to represent electromagnetic fields, particularly when inhomogeneous regions are modeled, since the node based elements impose an unnatural continuity of all field components across boundaries of mesh elements. Additionally, our approach is well suited to handle large size problems and lends itself to code parallelization.
