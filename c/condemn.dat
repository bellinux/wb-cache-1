Verne reportedly cut some especially negative lines out of the script, and protested when d'Ennery had them reinserted for the production. Journey Through the Impossible would be their last collaboration. The play is also Verne's only contribution to the féerie genre.|$|E
5|$|Although Sarah {{implied that}} she had {{encouraged}} the escape {{for the safety of}} Princess Anne, {{it is more likely that}} she was protecting herself and her husband. If James succeeded in defeating Prince William of Orange in battle he might imprison and even execute Lord and Lady Churchill for treason, whereas it was unlikely he would <b>condemn</b> his daughter to a similar fate. But James fled to France in December 1688 rather than confront the invading army, allowing William to take over his throne.|$|E

There was some good ideas of where to take the game. I've always wanted to do a reboot and just play <b>Condemned</b> 2 off as a bad hangover and have Thomas closer to what he was in Condemned: Criminal Origins." ...|$|R

The day after Groves took over, he and Marshall took a train to Tennessee to inspect the site that Marshall had chosen for the proposed production plant at Oak Ridge.

By mid-November US Marshals were tacking notices to vacate on farmhouse doors, and construction contractors were moving in.|$|E
5|$|If {{this were}} the case, Helble {{concluded}} that the United States should tell Diệm that his regime must <b>condemn</b> {{the actions of the}} troops and punish the culprits. If Diệm refused, the United States should threaten to publicly <b>condemn</b> and distance itself from Saigon. With the US also decrying the use of troops against civilian protests, the South Vietnamese government complained that unlike their Saigon counterparts, the Huế police were not trained in riot control. Diệm's authorities requested that the Americans airlift 350 military personnel from Vũng Tàu in the far south to quell the protests in Huế, but the Americans refused. William Trueheart, {{who was in charge of}} the US Embassy, Saigon while Ambassador Frederick Nolting was on holiday, confronted Secretary of State Nguyễn Đình Thuận about the allegations of blister gas usage the next day.

This speech {{was only the beginning}} of a large campaign directed against Kosygin.

5|$|In the Official History of Australian Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Post-Cold War Operations, author David Horner {{stated that}} the Australian {{government}} led by Robert Menzies was loath to criticise South Africa during the 1950s. At that time Australia generally opposed anti-colonial movements (which were often supported by the Soviets or China), believing them part of a worldwide communist offensive. Indeed, as late as 1961 Australia (and Britain) abstained from a vote to <b>condemn</b> South Africa in the UN.|$|E
5|$|Issues of Gallicanism were {{prominent}} in the 1689 conclave that had elected Alexander VIII. Alexander's predecessor, Innocent XI, had refused to confirm new French bishops {{to the point where}} thirty-five dioceses lacked a bishop confirmed by Rome in 1688. Alexander's election had been secured by promising that he would confirm the unconfirmed French bishops. Despite this, Alexander's last act as pope before he died was to <b>condemn</b> the Declaration of the Clergy of France on 1 February 1691.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{was among}} the councilman and {{citizens}} who expressed outrage at the light punishment issued by the mayor's office over a multimillion-dollar city contract scheme.

5|$|On January 8, 1861 Helm chaired {{a meeting}} in Louisville that {{advocated}} for Kentucky's neutrality in the Civil War. Helm was an outspoken opponent of secession, but also denounced the election of Abraham Lincoln and his {{use of military force}} to subdue the southern states. Because Helm did not <b>condemn</b> his son, Benjamin, for joining the Confederate Army, federal authorities classified him as a southern sympathizer.|$|E
5|$|The administration's {{response}} to racial violence was minimal, {{causing him to}} lose black support. When black postmasters at Hogansville, Georgia in 1897, and at Lake City, South Carolina the following year, were assaulted, McKinley issued no statement of condemnation. Although black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction, supporters responded by saying there was little the president could do to intervene. Critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly <b>condemn</b> such events, as Harrison had done.|$|E

5|$|The {{chain of}} {{events leading up to}} Bishop Tempier's {{condemnation}} of 1277 is still not entirely clear. The Catholic Encyclopedia records that the theologians of the University of Paris had been very uneasy due to the antagonism that existed between Christian dogmas and certain Peripatetic doctrines. According to the historian Edward Grant, the theologians desired to <b>condemn</b> Aristotle's teachings on the eternity {{of the world and the}} unicity of the intellect.|$|E
5|$|The {{claim that}} all humans are due {{dignity and respect}} as {{autonomous}} agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed on anyone and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society. Kant's approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely {{as a means to}} an end, leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to <b>condemn</b> certain specific sexual practices - for example, extramarital sex. Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics to <b>condemn</b> practices such as prostitution and pornography because they treat women as ends. Kant also believed that, because animals do not possess rationality, we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them. Kant used the example of lying as an application of his ethics: because there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, we must never lie, even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{trial was}} seen {{by some as a}} {{political}} trial, inspired by the Belgian establishment.
