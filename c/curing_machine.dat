5000|$|In {{parallel}} to her husband's {{work on the}} management of hospitals, Madame Necker progressively modified the symbolism of hospitals: from charity to benevolence. In addition, the ideas advocated by the Siècle des Lumières allowed reflection on hospitals. However {{it was not until}} the end of the 18th century that hospitals became a [...] "curing machine", where the patient is treated and leaves cured. Previous Paris hospitals were characterized with poor sanitation and treatment followed by high mortality rate. The Hôtel-Dieu had a mortality rate close to 25%. Testimonies revealed that at least 3 patients shared one hospital bed, attempts at isolating contagious diseases were seldom, and women would even have to share beds while giving birth. The 1,200 beds in the hospital were completely inadequate for housing its over 3,500 patients. Conditions enhanced in 1787, when the Hôtel-Dieu implemented a code of medical services that shifted the hospital from a <b>curing</b> <b>machine</b> run by nuns to a medical and surgical establishment run by doctors. [...] By the 19th century hospitals became places of teaching and medical research in addition to practicing medicine. The Hôtel-Dieu, however, had received a high status as a surgical training institution by the late 18th century with the appointment of Pierre J. Desault as chef de service in 1785. Desault established an elaborate educational program for surgical interns when previously they had only informal training.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the research are to identify and prioritize issues that affect {{the performance of the}} tire production process, give a number of solutions, and map the value stream of the future (future state mapping). One of the tools used to accurately map the current conditions of the production process in lean manufacturing concept is value stream map/VSM. Another measuring instrument used to increase productivity is the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), which includes time availability, engine performance and quality. From the three variables, {{it can be seen that}} the downtime variable has the largest contribution resulting in low value of the OEE. Based on the OEE data, product time change reached 18, 8 %, and waiting period contributed as much as 4, 9 % of the total downtime. To reduce the product change time, SMED method (Single Minutes Exchange Dies) is applied at the change of bladder in <b>curing</b> <b>machine,</b> and visual control and poka-yoke applications are also applied to reduce the waiting time.

Following the TCA wipe, the machined surface is given a resin wet-coat and over-wrapped with more prepreg and cured. A TCA replacement solvent for these wiping operations must effectively remove both surface contaminants, and sub-surface oils and greases while not compromising the integrity of this interface. Selection of a TCA replacement solvent for phenolic over-wrap interface cleaning began with sub-scale compatibility tests with cured phenolics. Additional compatibility tests included assessment of solvent retention in machined phenolic surfaces. Results from these tests showed that, while the candidate solvent did not degrade the cured phenolics, it was retained in higher concentrations than TCA in phenolic surfaces.

40|$|Curing of {{concrete}} has substantial {{effects on the}} performance of Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement. Curing effectiveness depends {{on the quality of the}} curing materials, time of curing compound application in relation to evaporation, and the amount and uniformity of the curing compound applications. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) developed and maintains a quality monitoring (QM) program for curing compounds to ensure that curing compounds used in TxDOT projects meet the minimum requirements. The timing of curing compound application as required in the specifications is well adhered. On the other hand, the uniformity and the amount of curing compounds applied are not monitored as well as they should be, primarily due to the lack of simple and proper methods for verifying their compliance with the specification requirements. To ensure good quality of curing in TxDOT paving projects, there is a need for simple and easy-to-use compliance testing.

40|$|Abstract. The bonding {{mechanism}} between water-based UV curable ink {{and active}} groups on paper’s fiber during curing process was studied in this paper. Low viscosity water-based UV-cured resin was synthesized by epoxy resins, epoxy diluent, acrylic acid and maleic anhydride {{in the presence}} of catalyst. The viscosity of the synthesis system and synthetic products were significantly reduced when epoxy diluent was added to replace parts of the epoxy resin. Epoxy diluent was very useful in reducing the viscosity of the product, but over-dose would have negative effects {{on the quality of the}} cured film. The water-based epoxy acrylate prepolymer was used as the substitution for the ink to investigate the binding mechanism between the active groups of prepolymer and fiber under UV irradiation. The prepolymer and photoinitiator were mixed and the mixture was diluted to an appropriate viscosity by a small amount of water, then printed on the paper by the method of analog printing and curred by UV <b>curing</b> <b>machine.</b> The printed paper was used to extract lignin by enzymatic/mild acidolysis. FT-IR was used to characterize the changes of the active groups in lignin. The results showed that the changes of active groups in lignin were founded in the existence of ultraviolet and photoinitiator, which consistent with the change of double bonds in prepolymer. The free radicals produced by photoinitiator in curing process not only promoted the double bonds to polymerize, but also accelerated the active groups of lignin binding.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} how Holey Fibre (HF) technology can positively impact {{the field of}} materials processing and fabrication, specifically Direct Write (DW). DW is the large scale, patterned deposition of functional materials onto both flat and conformal surfaces. Currently, DW techniques involve thermal post-processing whereby the entire structure is enclosed inside an oven, so limiting the DW technique to small, heat resistant surfaces. Selectively laser curing the ink would allow the ink to be brought up to the required temperature without heating the surrounding substrate material. In addition the ability to trim components would allow miniature circuits to be written and devices to be tuned by changing the capacitance or resistance. HF technology enables in-situ curing and trimming of direct write components using the same rig and length of fibre. HF's with mode areas in excess of 450 µm 2 can be routinely fabricated allowing high power transmission whilst retaining the high beam quality of the radiation source. We will present results of curing and trimming trials which demonstrate that HF's provide a distinct advantage over standard multimode fibres by allowing both <b>curing</b> and <b>machining</b> to be achieved through a single delivery fibre...|$|R

The applied load envelope exceeded worst-case dynamic flight conditions with an added safety factor of 25 %. At peak load the fairing must maintain structural integrity remaining within the defined dynamic displacement envelope.

The goal {{of this research is}} to provide a minimum 100 x reduction in the time required to produce arbitrary, laminated products without the need for a separate mold or an autoclave. It will accomplish this by developing the science underlying the rapid production of composite structures, specifically those of carbon fiber-epoxy materials. This scientific understanding will be reduced to practice in a demonstration device that will produce a part on the order of 12 in. by 12 in. by 6 in. Work in the past year has focussed on developing an understanding of the materials issues and of the machine design issues. Our initial goal was to use UV cureable resins to accomplish full <b>cure</b> on the <b>machine.</b> Therefore, we have centered our materials work around whether or not UV cureable resins will work. Currently, the answer seems to be that they will not work, because UV light cannot penetrate the carbon fibers, and because no "shadow" curing seems to occur. As a result, non-UV cureable resins are being investigated. This has resulted in a change in the machine design focus. We are now looking into a "dip and place" machine design, whereby a prepreg layer would have one side coated with a curing agent, and then would be placed onto the previous layer. This would lead to cure at the interface, but not {{to the top of the}} layer. The formulation of the resins to accomplish this task at room or slightly elevated temperatures is being investigated, as is the machine design needed to apply the curing agent and then cure or partially cure the part.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the electrical response of toughened nanocomposites subjected to quasi-static and dynamic loading. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been extensively researched and found to have exceptional mechanical and transport properties. Carbon nanotubes were used to form a sensory network inside of an epoxy matrix. The electrical response of the material was correlated to the deformation and damage in the nanocomposite. The CNT composites utilized an epoxy matrix toughened by rubber and/or cenospheres. The cenospheres and rubber changed the material 2 ̆ 7 s mechanical properties and effected the formation of the CNT network. This had an impact on the electoral response of the sensory network. ^ Experimental specimens of Epoxy/CNT nanocomposite were made by loading epoxy resin with CNT. CNTs tend to agglomerate so in order to create a well dispersed network of CNT, the epoxy resin and CNT were subjected to ultrasonication and shear mixing. A vacuum chamber was used to remove any air bubbles and moisture from the composite. Cenospheres or liquid rubber were shear mixed into the resin to enhance the nanocomposites mechanical properties. The CNT/Epoxy specimens were then poured into a mold, allowed to <b>cure</b> and <b>machined</b> to standard testing dimensions. ^ Quasi static loading of specimens was done by an Instron 5585 and stress/strain data was recorded by the Instron software.
