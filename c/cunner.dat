She was really afraid of all boats, but she was willing to go out with him in the sail-boat of a superannuated skipper, because to sit talking in the stern and stoop for the vagaries of the boom in tacking was such good exercise. She would join him in fishing from the rotting pier, but with no certainty which was a <b>cunner</b> and which was a sculpin, when she caught it, and with an equal horror of both the nasty, wriggling things. When they went a walk together, her notion of a healthful tramp was to find a nice place among the sweet-fern or the pine-needles, and sit down in it and talk, or make a lap, to which he could bring the berries he gathered for her to arrange in the shallow leaf-trays she pinned together with twigs. She really preferred a rocking-chair on the veranda to anything else; but if he wished to go to those other excesses, she would go with him, to keep him out of mischief.|$|E

However, basal enzyme levels {{are known to}} vary seasonally and the usage of extra-hepatic tissues for biological monitoring has received little attention. Laboratory experiments were conducted {{in the summer of}} 1985 to determine the induction potential of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) in liver, kidney, gill, and heart tissues of <b>cunners</b> (Tautogolabrus adspersus) exposed to no. 2 fuel oil (diesel oil) during the reproductive season. Although basal levels varied, induction was readily resolved in hepatic and extrahepatic tissues of both male and female <b>cunners</b> during prespawning, early spawning and late spawning. The induction potential of heart (7 - 18 fold) was much greater than liver (4 - 6 fold), kidney (4 - 7 fold) and gill (2 - 5 fold). Male <b>cunners</b> displayed a much higher induction potential compared to females in heart EROD during prespawning (18 versus 13 fold) and early spawning (12 versus 7 fold) but no significant sex differences were observed during late spawning. Sex differences were also evident in liver and kidney tissues throughout the reproductive season, males exhibiting higher enzyme activities than females in each case. [...] The potential for induction of a conjugating enzyme, glutathione S-transferase (GST), was also studied. Unlike EROD, GST was refractory to induction in all tissues of male and female <b>cunners</b> throughout gonad maturation/spawning. Depression of GST was observed in the heart tissue of diesel exposed males during early spawning and male liver and kidney during late spawning.

50|$|The diet of {{the little}} skate {{consists}} mostly of decapod crustaceans and amphipods. Polychaete worms are also an important prey item, while other invertebrates (including isopods, bivalves, squid, sea squirts, and copepods) and small benthic fishes (including sand lances, herring, <b>cunners,</b> and cod) are rarely taken. The importance of crustaceans in the skate's diet increases with size. This species shares its benthic habitat with the similar winter skate; the little skate focuses more on epifauna (organisms living atop the substrate) while the winter skate eats more infauna (burrowing organisms). The little skate has an extremely high number of electrosensory ampullae of Lorenzini around its mouth, giving it {{a high degree of}} spatial precision when hunting for prey buried in the substrate.|$|R
500|$|The {{marine waters}} around the {{province}} are considered boreal, or sub-Arctic, in nature. [...] A {{great deal of}} the coastline is rock-strewn, allowing an extensive variety of plant and animal life to thrive. The leading plants of the shoreline are the large brown seaweeds, such as bladder, forked and knotted Wracks, and winged and sugar kelps, though there are also a number of red and green seaweeds present. Common animals of the seashore region include barnacles, [...] tortoiseshell limpet, common periwinkle, blue mussels, sea anemones, sea slugs, sea urchins, starfish, and rock crabs. The deeper waters are home to a variety of fish, such as Atlantic cod, sculpins and <b>cunners,</b> halibut, haddock, sharks, and marine mammals, such as dolphins, porpoises, and whales. Whales seen off Newfoundland include Pilot whales, minkes, sei whales, fin whales and humpbacks. Harp and hooded seals are usually found in the spring, giving birth to their young on coastal ice floes.|$|R
50|$|Coastal marshes, bays, tidal creeks, {{and rivers}} support diverse {{shellfish}} and finfish populations. Sunfish (Lepomis species), creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), <b>cunner</b> (Tautogolabrus adspersus), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), common mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), American eel (Anguilla rostrata), and white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) abound. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are stocked in rivers and estuaries each year. The Ogunquit River sustains alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), pollock (Pollachius virens), bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), longhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecimspinosus), and winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus). The Webhannet River has native {{species such as}} winter flounder, northern pipefish (Syngnathus fuscus), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), common mummichog, Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) and Atlantic mackerel. The Merriland River sustains populations of American eel, brown trout, and brook trout. The Mousam River attracts little skate (Raja erinacea), American shad (Alosa sapidissima), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), bluefish, <b>cunner,</b> Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), pollock, and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). The Spurwink River supports blueback herring, Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), American shad, pollock, <b>cunner,</b> winter flounder, and little skate. Striped bass and brown trout are popular recreational fishing resources in the area. The National Marine Fisheries Service has designated as “essential fish habitat” areas that provide substrate necessary for fish spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity. Estuaries within the refuge boundaries are part of that essential fish habitat.|$|E

There is nothing so dispiriting as poor fishing, and I spend most of the time with my head on my hands, looking at the sea breaking against the rocks, shagged around the bases with sea-weed. It is a sunny forenoon, with a cool breeze from the southwest. The mackerel craft are in the offing. Mr. Laighton says that the Spy (the boat which went to the mainland this morning) is now on her return with all her colors set; and he thinks that Pierce is on board, he having sent Mr. Thaxter to invite him to come in this boat.|$|R

Others, and fair girls among them, with the flush of the hot day still on their cheeks, bend over the railing and watch the heaps of seaweed floating upward with the flowing tide. The horses now tramp heavily along the bridge and wistfully bethink them of their stables.--Rest, rest, thou weary world! for to-morrow's round of toil and pleasure will be as wearisome as to-day's has been, yet both shall bear thee onward a day's march of eternity.--Now the old toll-gatherer looks seaward and discerns the lighthouse kindling on a far island, and the stars, too, kindling in the sky, as if but a little way beyond; and, mingling reveries of heaven with remembrances of earth, the whole procession of mortal travellers, all the dusty pilgrimage which he has witnessed, seems like a flitting show of phantoms for his thoughtful soul to muse upon.|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} in Broad Cove, Newfoundland, was {{conducted}} to describe the reproductive behavior, mate selection and spawning success of the lumpfish Cyclopterus lumpus. [...] Prior to courtship male lumpfish exhibited a characteristic nuptial coloration consisting of a greyish-black body and orange-red ventral surface and fins. After an extended courtship involving nest site cleaning, caressing and quivering, females released gametes. Following fertilization, males engaged in molding behavior manipulating the eggs into the nest site producing funnel-like depressions in the egg mass. [...] Males remained with the eggs throughout the incubation period exhibiting parental behaviors essential for egg development and hatching. Parental care behaviors of males were independent of male size. Pectoral fanning and puffing were the predominant parental care behaviors exhibited throughout the incubation period. Puffing behavior appeared to increase as the eggs neared hatching. During hatching emergent larvae were swept from the nest site by male fanning and puffing behaviors. [...] Qualities of the male and characteristics of the nest site were tested as criteria for mate choice, and their effect on male spawning success was evaluated. The number of eggs guarded was not correlated with male length. Nest site location variables; depth, distance offshore and distance to the nearest male were not related to spawning success. Nest topography and nest site concealment were also not significant criteria for female choice. [...] The hatching success of an egg mass was not predictable {{on the basis of}} the size of the guarding male. Guarding males, regardless of size, were unable to defend their eggs from predation by <b>cunners,</b> Tautogolabrus adspersus. Hatching success of eggs was also independent of nest characteristics.

50|$|The {{most common}} marine {{fish in the}} Sound include porgy, butterfish, winter flounder, summer flounder, {{windowpane}} flounder, fourspot flounder, northern and striped sea robin, little skate, menhaden, Atlantic silversides, black seabass, blackfish (tautog), <b>cunner,</b> bluefish, and smooth dogfish. Frequently Atlantic bonito and false albacore, both members of the tuna family, enter the sound and can be caught by anglers from small boats and shore. Many species have declined rapidly since 1975 due to over fishing. Winter flounder may not be currently present except for rare, small local populations. Tautog and summer flounder are also less numerous. Anadromous fishes include striped bass, white perch, alewives, blueback herring, and American and hickory shad. Although several shark species likely infrequently wander {{in and out of}} the Sound, e.g. blue shark, mako shark, hammerhead shark & thresher shark, there are only four species of sharks which are regularly found in the area. These are the sand tiger shark, the sandbar shark, the spiny dogfish and the smooth dogfish.|$|E
5000|$|Instead of {{examining}} brain activity for sleep patterns, an alternate {{approach is to}} examine any rest/activity cycles that might indicate [...] "behavioural sleep". The following four behavioural criteria are characteristic of sleep in birds and mammals and could be extended to fishes: (1) prolonged inactivity; (2) typical resting posture, often in a typical shelter; (3) alternation with activity in a 24-h cycle; (4) high arousal thresholds. Based on these criteria, many fish species have been observed sleeping. [...] The typical sleep posture of the brown bullhead is with the fins stretched out, the tail lying flat on the bottom, the body inclined to one side at an angle of 10-30 degrees to the vertical, the cardiac and respiratory frequencies much slower than normal, and much less sensitivity to sound and to being touched. [...] Mozambique tilapia are motionless at the bottom at night, with a lower respiratory rate and no eye movement, {{and they do not}} respond as readily as during the day to electrical currents or food delivery. At night, Spanish hogfish, bluehead wrasse, the wrasse Halichoeres bivittatus, the <b>cunner</b> Tautogolabrus adspersus, and even requiem sharks, can be picked up by hand without eliciting a response. A 1961 observational study of approximately 200 species in European public aquaria reported many cases of apparent sleep.|$|E
40|$|Digestive proteases were {{isolated}} from the pancreas of the stomachless <b>cunner</b> fish (Tautogolabrus adspersus) and characterized {{in terms of their}} physicochemical properties, their ability to hydrolyze native pectin methylesterase (PME) from orange and polyphenol oxidases (PPO) from mushroom and the ability of the <b>cunner</b> enzyme(s) to maintain the stability of orange juice cloud. The <b>cunner</b> trypsin fraction exhibited exceptional capacity to hydrolyze native proteins versus the bovine trypsin. Incubation of native PME with <b>cunner</b> or bovine trypsin resulted in a loss of 75 % or 35 % in PME activity respectively. Similarly, a 75 % or 55 % loss in PPO activity was observed after treatment with <b>cunner</b> and bovine trypsin respectively. Bovine trypsin, however, hydrolyzed the heat-denatured PME and PPO better than the <b>cunner</b> trypsin. Also, there was no reactivation of both PME and PPO activity after treatment with either the <b>cunner</b> or bovine enzyme during storage at 4 $ sp circ$C for 3 weeks. However, PPO retained up to 20 % or 50 % of the initial activity after treatment with <b>cunner</b> or bovine trypsin, respectively. A 3 x 3 factorial design involving the factors of temperature, enzyme concentration and incubation time carried out gave an r$ sp 2 $ of 0. 92 and 0. 95 for <b>cunner</b> and bovine trypsin treated PME respectively.

60|$|I {{had to take}} a {{great deal}} of this on faith; in fact, none of it was {{susceptible}} of proof; but I have not been able since to experience all the skepticism which usually replaces the impression left by sympathy with such supposed occurrences. The thing was not quite what we call uncanny; the people were so honest, both of them, that the morbid character of like situations was wanting. The events, if they could be called so, were not invited, I was quite sure, and they were varied by such diversions as we had in reach. I went blueberrying with Mrs. Alderling in the morning after she had got her breakfast dishes put away, in order that we might have something for dessert at our midday dinner; and I went fishing off the old stone crib with Alderling in the afternoon, so that we might have <b>cunners</b> for supper. The farmerfolks and fisherfolks seemed to know them and to be on tolerant terms with them, though it was plain that they still considered them probational in their fellow-citizenship. I do not think they were liked the less because they did not assume to be of the local sort, but let their difference stand, if it would. There was nothing countrified in her dress, which was frankly conventional; the short walking-skirt had as sharp a slant in front as her dinner-gown would have had, and he wore his knickerbockers--it was then the now-faded hour of knickerbockers--with an air of going out golfing in the suburbs. They stood on ceremony in addressing the natives, who might have been Jim or Liza to each other, but were always Mr. Donald or Mrs. Moody, with the Alderlings. They said they would not like being called by their first names themselves, and they did not see why they should take that freedom with others. Neither by nature nor by nurture were they out of the ordinary in their ideals, and it was by a sort of accident that they were so different in their realities. She had stayed on with him through the first winter in the place they had taken for the summer, because she wished to be with him, rather than because she wished to be there, and he had stayed because he had not just found the moment to break away, though afterwards he pretended a reason for staying. They had no more voluntarily cultivated the natural than the supernatural; he kindled the fire for her, and she made the coffee for him, not because they preferred, but because they must; and they had arrived at their common ground in the occult by virtue of being alone together, and not by seeking the solitude for the experiment which the solitude promoted. Mrs. Alderling did not talk less, nor he more, when either was alone with me, than when we were all together; perhaps he was more silent, and she not quite so much; she was making up for him in his absence as he was for her in her presence. But they were always hospitable and attentive hosts, and though under the peculiar circumstances of Mrs. Alderling's having to do the house-work I necessarily had to do a good many things for myself, there were certain little graces which were never wanting, from her hands: my curtains were always carefully drawn, and my coverlet triangularly opened, so that I did not have to pull it down myself. There was a freshly trimmed lamp on the stand at my bed-head, and a book and paper-cutter put there, with a decanter of whiskey and a glass of water. I note these things to you, because they are touches which help remove the sense of anything intentional in the occultism of the Alderlings.|$|R

The onset-temperature for metabolic depression in <b>cunner</b> increased with body size, i. e. from 5 °C in YOY <b>cunner</b> to 7 °C in adults. In contrast, the extent of metabolic depression was ∼ 80 % (Q 10  = ∼ 15) for YOY fish, ∼ 65 % (Q 10  = ∼ 8) for small fish and ∼ 55 % (Q 10  = ∼ 5) for adults, and this resulted in the metabolic scaling exponent (b) gradually increasing from 0. 84 to 0. 92 between 9 °C to 1 °C. All size classes of <b>cunner</b> had significantly (approximately 60 %) lower routine metabolic rates at 10 °C than Atlantic cod. However, there was no species' difference in the temperature-induced maximum metabolic rate, and this resulted in factorial metabolic scope values that were more than two-fold greater for <b>cunner,</b> and CTMax values that were 6 – 9 °C higher (∼ 21 vs. 28 °C). These results: 1) show that ontogeny influences the temperature of initiation and the extent of metabolic depression in <b>cunner,</b> but not O 2 consumption when in a hypometabolic state; and 2) suggest that the evolution of cold-induced metabolic depression in this northern wrasse species has not resulted in a trade-off with upper thermal tolerance, but instead, an enhancement of this species' metabolic plasticity...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic {{tracking}} using a fixed hydrophone {{array system}} {{was conducted in}} conception Bay, Newfoundland, to study the activity and movement patterns of female <b>cunner,</b> Tautogolabrus adspersus, (Walbaum 1792). Eight female <b>cunner</b> were monitored at various times from June 17 to November 24, 1991, providing 107 days of tracking. The tracking system provided positional information on individual <b>cunner</b> at 15 - second intervals. Ultrasonic transmitters had an average life of 17 days. Transmitters were attached externally through the dorsal musculature. Transmitters had no adverse effect on equilibrium or swimming ability and produced no detectable changes in female activity or movement. [...] Fish were active diurnally, commencing activity on average 55 minutes after sunrise and ceasing activity about 60 minutes after sunset. Fish were assumed active whenever positional information was obtained on movement. The active period, ranging from 11 to 16. 5 hrs, corresponded to the interim between daily onset and cessation of activity and was interrupted by periods of inactivity lasting between 5 and 15 minutes. Several factors influenced the activity of female <b>cunner.</b> As daylength shortened, <b>cunner</b> had a corresponding decrease in the duration of their diurnal activity. Increases in water temperature resulted in {{a decrease in the}} length of inactivity bouts. At temperatures below 5 °C <b>cunner</b> seek shelter and remain inactive. During increased surface waves <b>cunner</b> remained inactive for longer periods of time. [...] Activity was uninfluenced by cloud cover and tidal cycle. Activity did not differ between morning and afternoon observations, but over the observation period between June and November inactivity bouts became more numerous and lasted for longer periods. [...] Female <b>cunner</b> exhibited limited movements, remaining within 80 m of their original point of capture. The home range areas of 8 female <b>cunner</b> ranged in size from 300 to 2353 m². Females utilized space disproportionately within the boundaries of their home ranges, spending 60 % of their time in 30 % of their home range. [...] As water temperatures increased, both on a daily and seasonal basis, females occupied smaller home ranges. Home range areas were larger during the afternoon than the morning. Size of home range areas were not affected by sea state, but increased as cloud cover increased. Seasonally the largest home ranges occurred in June-July, followed by October-November, and lastly August-September. [...] While daily changes in environmental variables (Le.

Territorial males exhibited significantly slower growth than non-territorial males from the same pair spawning population. Although group spawning males had similar rates of growth as did males from the pair spawning population, they did exhibit a negative correlation between length at age and gonadosomatic index (GSI), suggesting a tradeoff between gonadal investment and somatic growth. No such relationship existed for males from the pair spawning population. Females from the two populations grew at similar rates and their growth was not correlated with GSI.

40|$|The central {{hypothesis}} {{tested in}} this dissertation is that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) {{found in the}} aquatic environment disrupt reproductive processes in fish. To gain a broad perspective of existing evidence, {{a review of the}} current literature was conducted. From this literature review, the lack of a dependable method or indicator to assess reproductive fitness of fish in situ was identified as an outstanding need. ^ In laboratory experiments, reproductive endpoints (egg production, fertility and viablity) were measured in the marine fish Tautogolabrus adspersus, or <b>cunner,</b> implanted with estrogens. Estrone and ethynylestradiol significantly reduced egg production in treated <b>cunner</b> at the highest implanted concentration. Estradiol had no significant effects on any reproductive parameter when compared to controls. ^ The applicability of male plasma vitellogenin as an indicator of reproductive dysfunction in estrogen-treated <b>cunner</b> was investigated. Results suggest that male plasma vitellogenin is not a reliable indicator of reproductive impairment. ^ Because steroidogenesis is critical to normal reproductive processes, changes in the activity of steroidogenic enzymes might serve as a discerning indicator of reproductive dysfunction. As a preliminary test of this hypothesis, changes in the activity of aromatase were measured in the brains and gonads of <b>cunner</b> exposed to atrazine, an EDC that does not bind with the estrogen receptor but appears to interfere with normal steroidogenesis. Aromatase catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens. In atrazine-treated <b>cunner,</b> reproduction (egg production, fertility and viability) was significantly decreased and brain aromatase activity significantly increased in one atrazine treatment. To further explore the hypothesis that aromatase activity could be used as an indicator of reproductive dysfunction in fish, <b>cunner</b> were exposed to a variety of EDCs, including estradiol, ethynylestradiol, octylphenol and androstatrienedione (an aromatase inhibitor). Reproductive endpoints were compared to brain and gonad aromatase activity in exposed fish. Results indicate that changes in male brain aromatase activity is a reliable indicator of exposure to all of these EDCs. Modulation of aromatase activity in the brains of spawning male <b>cunner</b> exposed to these EDCs was also consistently linked with reproductive impairment in these fish. ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>cunner,</b> Tautogolabrus adspersus, is {{a marine}} teleost endemic {{to the cold}} waters of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. The <b>cunner</b> is {{non-migratory}} and {{is known for its}} remarkable ability to endure the freezing winter months with little to no food. During this period, the <b>cunner</b> seeks refuge in the same rocky shelters it inhabits during the summer months and enters a torpid/dormant state. This response is characterized by a cessation of feeding, sluggish movements and a lowering of metabolic rate. Such a response calls for strict control of energy balance, and might use in part regulatory mechanisms present within the gut. To evaluate the physiological strategies employed by the cunner’s intestinal tract to withstand food deprivation, experimental fasting trials were conducted. <b>Cunner</b> were sampled for their stomachless digestive tract after a four-week period of acute food deprivation in July and August during their summer (active/feeding) state, and during their natural overwinter fasting in March. Digestive enzyme activities were assessed by biochemical assay. Specific activities for trypsin, alkaline phosphatase and lipase were all reduced in both 4 -week fasted and torpid fish, whereas aminopeptidase-N was only lowered in 4 -week fasted fish. Neither summer nor winter fasting caused significant changes in the intestinal mRNA expressions of digestive enzymes, {{with the exception of a}} decrease in aminopeptidase-N expression during torpor. Transcript expression in the gastrointestinal tract was also quantified for four putative appetite regulators. Orexin, the mechanistic target of rapamycin and cholecystokinin expressions were all reduced in torpid <b>cunner,</b> but not in summer fasting whereas apelin expression was reduced in summer fasting, but not in torpid fish. This work contributes to the overall understanding of energy balance in fish and provides novel insights into the intestine’s endocrine contribution to appetite regulation and digestive function in <b>cunner</b> during natural fasting and acute food deprivation...|$|E

40|$|This thesis examined: 1) how {{ontogeny}} affects {{aspects of}} metabolic {{depression in the}} cunner; and 2) whether the stress response of adult <b>cunner</b> is modified during metabolic depression. The effect of decreasing temperature at 2 °C per day on the metabolism of three size classes of ∼ 9 °C acclimated <b>cunner</b> was studied. The onset-temperature for metabolic depression in <b>cunner</b> decreased with body size (age), i. e. 7 °C in adult fish vs. 6 °C and 5 °C in small and young-of-the-year (YOY) fish, respectively. In contrast, the extent of metabolic depression was ∼ 80 % (Q₁₀ = ∼ 15) for YOY fish, ∼ 65 % (Q₁₀ = ∼ 8) for small fish, and ∼ 55 % (Q₁₀ = ∼ 5) for adults. Stress hormone levels and steroidogenic transcript levels were measured in adult <b>cunner</b> acclimated at 0 °C and 10 °C. Fish at 10 °C had 9. 09 fold and 4. 77 fold higher post-stress plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels, respectively, and 4. 67 fold greater resting plasma cortisol levels (∼ 65 ng ml⁻¹) compared with 0 °C fish (∼ 10 ng ml⁻¹). However, cortisol levels did not increase post-stress in 10 °C fish, whereas 0 °C fish had a 'typical' stress response with cortisol levels reaching ∼ 107 ng ml⁻¹ by 2 hours post-stress.

40|$|Enzyme {{immobilization}} as {{a technique}} attaches free forms of enzyme molecules to stationary support materials to permit enzymes {{to be reused}} several times. Bovine trypsin as a model enzyme was immobilized onto controlled pore glass (CPG) beads to investigate the optimum conditions for immobilization, {{as well as the}} physico-chemical properties of the immobilized enzyme versus the free form of the enzyme. At pH 9, about 60 % of the enzyme protein incubated with CPG was immobilized onto the CPG, and immobilized bovine trypsin activity was determined as 0. 265 BAPNA U/g CPG beads. The immobilized bovine trypsin showed lower affinity for its substrate, lower susceptibility to inhibition by soybean trypsin inhibitor and higher thermal stability, while the optimum pH and optimum temperature values were shifted to higher values compared to those of the free enzyme. The immobilized enzyme was evaluated for its capacity to extract carotenoproteins from shrimp shell. After 11 re-uses, the immobilized enzyme retained about 77 % of its initial activity, and the total yield of the product from the same immobilized trypsin was 4. 3 times higher than a single use of the same amount of the free enzyme. <b>Cunner</b> fish is a cold water adapted, stomachless teleost fish. <b>Cunner</b> fish trypsin possesses some unique properties compared with homologous trypsins from (i) species acclimated to warm temperature regimes, and (ii) species with functionally distinct-stomachs. <b>Cunner</b> fish trypsin was extracted from pancreatic tissue, and immobilized onto CPG beads using glutaraldehyde as cross-linking reagent. The influence of enzyme loading, the properties of the immobilized enzyme in terms of specific activities, and responses to pH and temperature were investigated. The kinetic properties and operational stability of the immobilized <b>cunner</b> trypsin were studied as well. The pH optimum of the immobilized fish trypsin shifted from pH 8. 5 to pH 9, and the temperature optimum also increased from 45 ºC to 50 ºC versus the free form of the <b>cunner</b> enzyme. The catalytic efficiencies (Vmax/Km) of the immobilized fish trypsin were determined for both amidase and esterase reactions, using BAPNA and TAME as substrates and were found to be greater than those of immobilized bovine trypsin. Thus, the immobilized <b>cunner</b> fish trypsin had a higher catalytic capacity for the hydrolysis of both the amide and ester substrates. The operational stability of immobilized fish trypsin was studied by extracting carotenoprotein from shrimp shell. The immobilized fish trypsin retained 75 % of its initial hydrolytic capacity after 11 re-uses, and the yield obtained was over 20 % higher than that of immobilized bovine trypsin. When the immobilized <b>cunner</b> fish trypsin was applied to digest native pectin methylesterase (PME), it exhibited greater capacity to inactivate the PME than immobilized bovine trypsin. The inactivation efficiency of the immobilized fish trypsin was 20 % higher than that of the immobilized bovine trypsin. The inactivation of PME was influenced by PME concentration, incubation time and temperature. In general, higher temperature, longer incubation period, and lower initial PME concentration produced more PME inactivation. PME inactivated by immobilized fish trypsin and bovine trypsin regained part of its activity during storage at 4 ºC. The initial PME concentration affected the reactivation period. The kinetic studies indicated that the inactivation rate constants increased and D-values (time to inactivate 90 % of the enzyme) decreased with increasing temperature for both immobilized fish trypsin and bovine trypsin. The activation energy (Ea) of PME inactivation by the immobilized fish trypsin was lower than that by the immobilized bovine trypsin, which explains why the immobilized fish trypsin had higher catalytic capacity at various temperatures than immobilized bovine trypsin...|$|E
