5|$|Brazil {{has one of}} {{the largest}} {{renewable}} energy programs in the world, involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar <b>cane,</b> <b>and</b> ethanol now provides 18 percent of the country's automotive fuel. As a result of this and the exploitation of domestic deep water oil sources, Brazil, which for years had to import a large share of the petroleum needed for domestic consumption, recently reached complete self-sufficiency in liquid fuels.|$|E

5|$|Cicadas are not major {{agricultural}} pests {{but in some}} outbreak years, trees may be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of females laying their eggs in the shoots. Small trees may wilt and larger trees may lose small branches. Although in general, the feeding activities of the nymphs do little damage, during the year before an outbreak of periodic cicadas, the large nymphs feed heavily and plant growth may suffer. Some species have turned from wild grasses to sugar <b>cane,</b> <b>and</b> this has affected the crop adversely, {{and in a few}} isolated cases, females have oviposited on food crops such as date palms, grape vines, citrus trees, asparagus and cotton.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{the rise}} of slavery {{was due to the}} {{increasing}} rise of crops being produced and traded, more specifically {{the rise of}} the plantation economy The rise of the plantations was the main reason for the trade of commodities during proto-globalization. Plantations were used by the exporting countries (mainly America) to grow the raw materials needed to manufacture the goods which were traded back into the plantation economy. Commodities that grew in trade due to the plantation economy were mainly tobacco, cotton, sugar <b>cane,</b> <b>and</b> rubber.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Inez {{struck the}} Dominican Republic near peak intensity. Along the Barahona Peninsula, more than 800homes were destroyed, and {{nationwide}} about 5,000people were left homeless. There was heavy {{damage to the}} country's cotton industry, {{as well as the}} coffee, sugar <b>cane,</b> <b>and</b> cocoa crops along the Barahona Peninsula. In the capital city of Santo Domingo, heavy rains flooded hundreds of homes along the Ozama River, forcing thousands to evacuate. High seas there damaged a portion of a seawall. Many rivers along the Barahona Peninsula were also flooded. Throughout the country, Inez killed about 100people, including 55 in Juancho, and left $12million in damage.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} differences between proto-globalization and archaic globalization was the switch from inter-nation trading of rarities to the trading of commodities. During the 12th and 13th centuries it was common to trade items that were foreign and rare to different cultures. A popular trade during archaic globalization involved European merchants sailing to areas of India or China in order to purchase luxury items such as porcelain, silk and spices. Traders of the pre-modern period also traded drugs and certain foods such as sugar <b>cane</b> <b>and</b> other crops.|$|E
5|$|The {{flooding}} {{caused by}} Irene damaged more than 471,000acres (1,900km²) of sugar <b>cane</b> <b>and</b> 39,000acres (158km²) of banana plantations. Irene's rainfall also flooded tobacco fields. Throughout the country, Irene's rainfall damaged 27,336houses and caused the total loss of 730. 13hospitals were also affected to some extent. 154sectors of Havana lost power {{due to the}} storm.

5|$|Across Honduras, {{agriculture}} sustained serious damage, with initial {{estimates of}} 70% of crops destroyed. Flooding affected about 29% of the country's arable land, much of covered {{for an extended}} period of time. This washed away large areas of topsoil, which would take a long period of time to recover. About 85% of the banana crop was lost, along with the loss of 60% of melons, 60% of sugar <b>cane,</b> <b>and</b> 58% of corn. About one-third of the corn crop had already been harvested. About 50,000bovine were killed, as were 60% of the fowl population. Crop and agricultural damage totaled about $1billion, which would take the country years to recover. Poor road conditions following the storm prevented crops from being dried, which caused further damage.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of Sina {{affecting}} the Fijian islands, from November 27 until November 29, with wind gusts {{of up to}} , hundreds of people were evacuated from Fiji's outer island resorts to hotels on the mainland. As the cyclone affected Fiji high winds and heavy rain forced the closure of several local airports and the Nadi International Airport for around 20 hours. As the cyclone moved towards the east-southeast between November 27–28, it passed near to or over the south-western coast of Viti Levu, Vatulele, Bequa, Northern Kadavu and various islands within the Moala and Southern Lau island groups and caused some coastal erosion. As it moved through the archipelago, the system destroyed or damaged houses and other building structures, while bringing down electric and telephone lines and uprooting trees. The system also severely affected crops and vegetation including sugar <b>cane</b> <b>and</b> pine forests, however {{the extent of the}} damage was limited by {{the fact that many of}} the crops had already been harvested.|$|E
5|$|Butler {{participated in}} a series of occupations, police actions, and {{interventions}} by the United States in Central America and the Caribbean, commonly called the Banana Wars because their goal was to protect American commercial interests in the region, particularly those of the United Fruit Company. This company had significant financial stakes in the production of bananas, tobacco, sugar <b>cane,</b> <b>and</b> other products throughout the Caribbean, Central America and the northern portions of South America. The U.S. was also trying to advance its own political interests by maintaining its influence in the region and especially its control of the Panama Canal. These interventions started with the Spanish–American War in 1898 and ended with the withdrawal of troops from Haiti and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy in 1934. After his retirement, Butler became an outspoken critic of the business interests in the Caribbean, criticizing the ways in which U.S. businesses and Wall Street bankers imposed their agenda on United States foreign policy during this period.|$|E

5|$|In {{advance of}} Winifred's approach, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) issued cyclone watches and {{warnings}} for various locations along the Queensland coast, prompting evacuations in several towns. Damage after landfall was widespread and severe, {{with thousands of}} homes damaged, flooding {{as a result of}} heavy rainfall along major rivers, and severe damage to crops. Debris obstructed roads across northern Queensland and power outages disrupted electrical service, even at water treatment plants, forcing officials to warn residents to boil water as a precautionary measure. Overall, the cyclone caused $86.4million in agriculture-related damages, with sugar <b>cane</b> <b>and</b> banana harvests suffering the most. Tourist operations were generally uninterrupted by the storm, while ecological and environmental damage, if any, was mild. Even so, high winds uprooted trees in wide swaths of forests, with those not completely defoliated. Overall, Winifred caused three deaths and inflicted $130million (1986AUD; $154million USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|John Kramer's widow Jill Tuck meets Matt Gibson, an {{internal}} affairs detective from the precinct where Detective Mark Hoffman works. She incriminates Hoffman {{in exchange for}} protection and immunity from prosecution. Gibson, who has distrusted Hoffman ever since he saved his life by gunning down a homeless man, agrees to her terms. Meanwhile, Hoffman abducts a skinhead gang – Dan, Evan, Jake and Kara – and places them in a junkyard trap that kills them all, leaving the reverse bear trap at the scene to incriminate Jill, who is later put into protective custody. After a meeting of Jigsaw survivors, including Lawrence Gordon, who cauterized his leg on a steam pipe after escaping the bathroom and now uses a <b>cane</b> <b>and</b> prosthetic foot, Hoffman abducts Bobby Dagen, a self-help guru who achieved fame and fortune by falsifying his own survival story. He sends Gibson some videos with cryptic clues to the game's location, offering to end the games if Jill is given to him.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon's early {{education}} was {{obtained in the}} public schools of Madisonville. While there, one of his teachers was his sister, Susan Isabella Laffoon, who was only 16 years old. At age 15, while plowing a field, Laffoon was kicked in the hip by a mule, requiring a six-week stay in a Nashville hospital. In the winter of the same year, he slipped on some ice and re-injured the hip. As a result of these injuries, his right leg was one-and-a-half inches shorter than his left leg, requiring him to wear special shoes and walk with a <b>cane</b> <b>and</b> a limp {{for the rest of his}} life. After his injury, Laffoon's parents decided that he could not make his living as a farmer and sent him to the private school of W. C. O'Bryan. By age 17, he was teaching in the common schools of Charleston in Hopkins County.|$|E

Spears then begins chasing Madonna in a wooden-like maze, and the latter enters a room covered with fallen leaves and stands in a swing. Once Spears finds the room, Madonna {{is nowhere to be}} found. Throughout the video, Madonna gradually loses her symbolic power, paralleled by her disposing the <b>cane</b> <b>and</b> jacket, becoming less phallic and more noticeably female biologically and more feminine socially. Although it ultimately seems that Spears becomes the dominant figure, Madonna recovers her phallic power {{in the form of a}} cigar from an onlooking male. Spears appears in Madonna's room and throws her against the wall, and Madonna vanishes just as they are about to kiss. The video ends as Madonna's laugh is heard in the background.|$|E
5|$|A second noted {{house in}} the Dupont Circle {{neighborhood}} which is claimed to be haunted is the Woodrow Wilson House (2340 S Street NW). Woodrow Wilson was elected President of the United States in 1912, was re-elected in 1916 promising to keep the nation out of war, led the nation through World War I, and left office in 1921. At 2 AM on September 26, 1919, while traveling to Wichita, Kansas, on a nationwide speaking tour to win public support to pressure the Senate into ratifying the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson collapsed and, after cancelling {{the rest of his}} speaking tour, was rushed back to the capital by train. His condition worsened on the journey, and upon arriving at the White House on October 2 the President suffered a life-threatening stroke that left him permanently paralyzed on his left side and blind in the left eye. Although the President lived, he was confined to bed for two months, seen only by his wife, a few close associates, and his physicians. From December 1919 to April 1920 Wilson required a wheelchair. Wilson attended his first Cabinet meeting in April 1920, {{but for the rest of}} the year his mind continued to wander, his memory was marred, and he tired easily. By March 1921 (when he left office) Wilson was able to walk short distances with the use of a <b>cane</b> (<b>and</b> with a valet close at hand). The extent of Wilson's disability was kept from the public until after his death on February 3, 1924. President and Mrs. Wilson purchased a large home at 2340 S Street NW, to which a number of modifications were made (including the addition of an elevator). Woodrow Wilson received few guests in his last years, and died in his third floor bedroom on February 3, 1924. His wife, Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, lived in the home until her death on December 28, 1961, and willed the home to the National Trust for Historic Preservation to be made into a museum honoring her husband. In the decades since her death, staff and visitors at the Woodrow Wilson House claim to have seen the President's ghost sitting in his rocking chair, heard the shuffle of a man walking with a <b>cane,</b> <b>and</b> heard a man sob.|$|E
