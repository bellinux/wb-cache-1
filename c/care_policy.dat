40|$|End of life {{care for}} people with {{advanced}} chronic disease is a growing international imperative, {{with the majority of}} deaths in the world now related to chronic disease. The provision of care that meets the needs of people with advanced chronic disease must be guided by appropriate policy. The key policy areas impacting directly on end of life care are related to chronic disease, palliative care and, increasingly, aged care. This paper describes the outcomes of an audit of Australian chronic disease and end of life/palliative <b>care</b> <b>policies.</b> We identified that chronic disease health policies/strategies demonstrate a focus on prevention, early intervention and management, with scant recognition of end of life care needs. The majority assume that a referral to palliative care will address end of life care needs {{for people with}} chronic disease. By contrast, palliative <b>care</b> <b>policies</b> recognise the need for the incorporation of a palliative approach into advanced chronic disease care, but there are few connections between these two policy areas. Whilst palliative <b>care</b> <b>policies</b> intersect with carer and advance <b>care</b> planning <b>policies,</b> chronic disease policy does not. Key concerns requiring consideration when developing policy in this area are discussed and possible policy options identified. Teresa Burgess, Annette Braunack-Mayer, Gregory B.

40|$|This article {{offers a}} micro-macro-economic {{approach}} {{for the long}} term analysis of health care sector and health <b>care</b> <b>policies.</b> The medical supply behavior is built using a «working-time allocation choice» between various qualities of care; this choice is connected to a decomposition of health care in two activities: one effective and another non-effective («induced demand»). A technical progress is also introduced in the model, taking into account the specificity of medical progress («extension of range»). These micro-economic foundations of health supply are then integrated in a model of growth with capital accumulation and overlapped generations (Solow-Diamond type). The conclusions concern the evolution of health expenditures, the population? welfare and capital accumulation, with respect to different health <b>care</b> <b>policies.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|A nationally {{recognized}} leader on health <b>care</b> <b>policy,</b> Altmire authored {{the legislation that}} ended the late enrollment penalty for low-income seniors participating in the Medicare Part D program, and he played a decisive role in preventing a proposed 2007 Medicare budget cut for hospitals.

Altmire was a key participant in the congressional debate {{on health care reform}} in 2009 and 2010.

25|$|The Conservatives {{argued that}} the GST cuts would benefit all Canadians, {{including}} low-income earners and those outside the workforce who do not pay income tax. The first GST cut went into effect on July 1, 2006, and no provinces have raised provincial sales tax yet. In addition, the Conservatives rolled back the income tax cut on the lowest tax bracket, restoring it back to 15.5% from 15%, increased and added tax exemption rates and introduced a $100 monthly child care allowance for families with children at or {{under the age of}} six. The Liberals and NDP voiced disapproval over the Conservatives following through on their election promise to replace the Liberal's proposed child <b>care</b> <b>policy</b> with their own, and for replacing Canada's $4 billion environmental policy with a $2 billion Conservative plan.

40|$|The rise of {{consumerism}} and {{the increasing}} availability of information through the Internet have increased patients’ demand for care that is {{more in line with}} their preferences. Because of this trend the expectation that hospitals act according to each individual patient’s preferences is becoming even more prominent. Hospitals could respond by implementing flexible health <b>care</b> <b>policies</b> that offer patients more choice. In this dissertation we explore two types of flexible health <b>care</b> <b>policies</b> from the consumer perspective: priority access pricing and customized care. We do this by (1) investigating how consumers evaluate price-based priority access allocation policies (i. e., allocation policies in which patients are offered the option to pay extra for faster health care access), and by (2) demonstrating how the collective costs and benefits of customized health <b>care</b> <b>policies</b> (i. e., policies that offer individuals the possibility to “create” their own health care program) can be used to evaluate customized care. Throughout, special attention is given to the role of collective health outcomes. Besides our scientific conclusions, our findings are also relevant for hospitals and policy makers that consider implementing new allocation policies. They can be used to provide assistance in future health care decision making...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{antibiotic}} {{policies of}} hospitals and primary care trusts (PCTs) in South East England were audited {{in the summer}} of 2004, to see how they had improved since 2000. METHODS: Antibiotic policies were obtained from pharmacists in NHS hospitals and PCTs, and examined for dates, formats, evidence base for policies, the type of guidance given on dosage, length of treatment, choice of antibiotics, coverage of common infections and reasons for prophylaxis. RESULTS: Twenty-three hospital and 25 primary <b>care</b> <b>policies</b> were examined. The average age of policies was 12 months, but 13 were more than 2 years old. The commonest format was an A 4 -sized document available in an electronic version. Primary <b>care</b> <b>policies</b> were more uniform than hospital <b>policies.</b> More primary <b>care</b> than hospitals' <b>policies</b> gave evidence to support their guidance. Ten policies used plain English for dosages, and 38 (79 %) policies made few or no cautionary points about the drugs recommended. Respiratory and urinary infections were covered in most policies, but guidance on gastroenteritis and antibiotic prophylaxis was less frequent. There was little advice in the policies on the management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Primary <b>care</b> <b>policies</b> have improved since 2000, using a national model for evidence and a consistent style. Hospitals could benefit from similar national guidance, especially in the evidence to support the contents of antibiotic policies...|$|R

25|$|The Deferre Law {{reduced the}} powers of the prefect, set up elected {{regional}} councils, and increased {{the powers of}} local government. The security court was abolished, and measures were introduced to control police harassment. Legal aid was extended, legislation was introduced which effectively combated discrimination against homosexuals, and the traditional powers of the juge d’instruction in the preparation of criminal cases was reduced. The Quillot Law of 1982 provided renters with additional rights in housing matters, while an audiovisual law passed that same year brought an end to the state monopoly of audiovisual broadcasting and established a High Authority to guarantee the independence of public television channels. Laws were passed in 1982 to reform higher education to make the academy more responsive {{to the needs of the}} state. High security wings in prisons were abolished, while social security reform increased workers’ representation on the bodies that oversaw the management of the social security schemes. In order to make the elite political academy (the ENA) accessible to a wider section of the population, a special entry pathway was established for those who had held trade union or political office. A new health <b>care</b> <b>policy</b> was implemented, which included the abolition of private beds in hospitals, reform of medical training, modernisation of facilities, and the election of the heads of medical services by the entire staff, rather than just by doctors, as had previously been the case. The Mauroy Government also withdrew a ministerial circular issued by the previous government that limited initiatives by regional councils, while a grant was created for the purpose of subsidizing local cultural projects and activities.|$|E
