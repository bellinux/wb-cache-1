40|$|Cuts by Rickard Lindqvist and Andreas Eklöf The {{aim of the}} Cuts {{project is}} to merge print design and pattern cutting within the {{practise}} of fashion design. Working within a tradition of cutting with only one pattern piece, established by French costume designer Genevieve Sevin-Doering, the project developed out of a selection Rickard's pattern archive. Instead of seeing print design and pattern cutting as two separated activities the cutting pattern becomes the print, which then becomes the <b>cutting</b> <b>template.</b> A printed line replaces the cutting line and no fabric is cut away {{in the making of}} the garments. The printed patterns are exhibited in there own right alongside with the garments made out of them. The beauty in the lines of the cutting is as important any other line in the garment composition...|$|E
40|$|Reconstruction of {{composite}} orbital defects {{must address}} the orbit and an exposed skull base and/or maxillary region. The orbit should not only be covered but also reshaped to accommodate the orbital contents or an epithesis when warranted. This study presents a rationale for a near-anatomical reconstruction of the orbit, together with adjacent dead space obliteration, using the segmentalized osteo-fascia-cutaneous fibula flap. Before the flap transfer, a <b>cutting</b> <b>template</b> for the fibula is made according to the measures and requirements of the facial defect. The segmentalized bone is then osteosynthesized to the facial skeleton and revascularized. Thus, an orbital depth is created by the bony fibula, whereas the fascio-cutaneous part of the flap {{may be used for}} lining the orbit and obliteration of the skull base or the maxillary region, or resurface the palate and/or the nasal cavity...|$|E
40|$|Flap endonucleases (FENs), {{essential}} for DNA replication and repair, recognize and remove RNA or DNA 5 ′-flaps. Related to FEN specificity for substrates with free 5 ′-ends, but controversial, {{is the role}} of the helical arch observed in varying conformations in substrate-free FEN structures. Conflicting models suggest either 5 ′-flaps thread through the arch, which when structured can only accommodate single-stranded (ss) DNA, or the arch acts as a clamp. Here we show that free 5 ′-termini are selected using a disorder-thread-order mechanism. Adding short duplexes to 5 ′-flaps or 3 ′-streptavidin does not markedly impair the FEN reaction. In contrast, reactions of 5 ′-streptavidin substrates are drastically slowed. However, when added to premixed FEN and 5 ′-biotinylated substrate, streptavidin is not inhibitory and complexes persist after challenge with unlabelled competitor substrate, regardless of flap length or the presence of a short duplex. Cross-linked flap duplexes that cannot thread through the structured arch react at modestly reduced rate, ruling out mechanisms involving resolution of secondary structure. Combined results explain how FEN avoids <b>cutting</b> <b>template</b> DNA between Okazaki fragments and link local FEN folding to catalysis and specificity: the arch is disordered when flaps are threaded to confer specificity for free 5 ′-ends, with subsequent ordering of the arch to catalyze hydrolysis...|$|E

40|$|In practice, cutting {{large number}} of pieces with {{different}} shapes often requires a well plan of assigning number of shapes on the cut template. The working arrangement of the cut-template is treated as Cut order plan (COP). The aim is to optimize <b>cutting</b> <b>templates</b> of fabric <b>cutting</b> function in apparel manufacturing firms when the cut order requirement is known. This solving of cut order plan problem is usually a tedious procedure so a signiﬁcant amount of arithmetic operations are required if conventional heuristic algorithms being used. However, optimization of COP solutions is not guaranteed by the conventional heuristics. This study presents a canonical genetic algorithm (CGA) approach {{to the problems of}} cut order planning with the objective of finding the optimum size ratios for each cut template used to fulfill the cut order requirement. General CGA techniques were used to achieve better solutions under a self-tuning attached to the proposed algorithm. Several cut order cases were employed to justify the performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method can yield better solutions compared to the available methodologies of generating cut-order plans available in apparel industr...|$|R
40|$|We present herein a {{new class}} of resin {{formulations}} for stereolithography, named FlexSL, with a broad bandwidth of tunable mechanical properties. The novel polyether(meth) acrylate based material class has outstanding material characteristics in combination with the advantages of being a biocompatible (meth) acrylate based processing material. FlexSL shows very promising results in several initial biocompatibility tests. This emphasizes its non-toxic behavior in a biomedical environment, caused mainly by the (meth) acrylate based core components. A short overview of mechanical and processing properties will be given in the end. The herein presented novel FlexSL materials show a significant lower cytotoxicity in contrast to commercial applied acrylic stereolithography resins. Further biocompatibility tests according to ISO 10993 protocols are planned. On the one hand, there are technical applications for this material (e. g. flaps, tubes, hoses, cables, sealing parts, connectors and other technical rubber-like applications), and on the other hand, broad fields of potential biomedical applications in which the FlexSL materials can be beneficial are obvious. Especially these could be small series production of medical products with special flexible material requirements. In addition, the usage for individual soft hearing aid shells, intra-operative planning services and tools like intra-op <b>cutting</b> <b>templates</b> and sawing guides is very attractive. The possibility to modify the FlexSL resins also for high-resolution applications makes it possible to manufacture now very flexible micro-prototypes with outstanding material characteristics and very fine structures with a minimum resolution of 20 mym and a layer thickness of minimal 5 myrn. These resin formulations are applicable and adjustable to other stereolithographic equipment available on the market...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Nanotechnology {{deals with}} {{structures}} that their dimensions are approximately between 1 to 100 nanometers. Research {{has shown that}} the composition, shape and different sizes of nanosilver make the features that possess different toxic effects compared with the chemicals with same but larger composition (microsilver). Nanosilver is associated with cell division, oxidative stress, and apoptosis or cell death. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effects of nanosilver on lung tissues. Methods: In this study, 50 adult male Wistar rats were examined in two groups of experimental and control. 70 nm silver nanoparticles with four different concentrations 0. 25, 0. 5, 1 and 2 mg kg- 1 were orally administered for 30 days. To investigate the pathological changes after 30 days, the lung tissue of mice in each group was apart and kept in formalin for histopathological examination. After molding and <b>cutting,</b> <b>template</b> samples were stained with H &E staining method. Then slides were observed by invert microscope. Results: According to the results, the high-dose groups(N 4, N 5) showed more pathological effects compared with other groups(N 2, N 3) and controls. In general, the effect of silver nanoparticles on lung tissue was significant and the resulting changes revealed cell and tissue damage. Conclusion: The toxicity of silver nanoparticles, administrated orally for 30 days in the experimental groups, was investigated that showed its harmful effect on lung tissue determined by pathological examinatio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Nesting in {{the leather}} {{industry}} {{is the problem}} of placing a set of irregularly shaped pieces known as templates on a plane irregularly shaped surface, such that no templates overlap and that the trim loss produced when <b>cutting</b> out the <b>templates</b> is minimised. Manual nesting process has many shortcomings that results in low productivity. In the mass manufacture of leather furniture, saving of materials is very important as material cost is the major portion of the overall production cost. By making use of automation, efficient nesting and cutting productivity is achieved. This paper discusses the manual as well as the automated processes of nesting and cutting for leather furniture production. It was found that a very high material utilization can be achieved through the automation of nesting and cutting processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{methods of}} {{molecular}} biology allow for analyzing the methylation {{pattern in the}} whole genome and in particular genes. We differentiate methylated sequences from unmethylated ones by means of <b>cutting</b> the genomic <b>template</b> with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes or by sodium bisulfite DNA modification. Chemical modification precedes most quantitative and qualitative PCR techniques: MS-PCR, MS-nested PCR, Real-Time PCR, QAMA, HeavyMethyl, MSHRM. Restriction enzymes, on the other hand, may be used together with PCR or hybridisation methods (Southern blot and microarrays). PCRs are conducted with primers specific for methylated and unmethylated sequences and sometimes, similarly to hybridisation techniques, with specifically labeled probes or dyes intercalating to double-stranded nucleic acids. The most advanced methylation detection techniques (MALDI-TOF MS and HPLC) significantly {{reduce the amount of}} biological material used for tests, but they require specialist equipment...|$|R
30|$|With the {{development}} of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology, it has been possible to reconstruct the cranio-maxillofacial defect with more accurate preoperative planning, precise patient-specific implants (PSIs), and shorter operation times. The manufacturing processes include subtractive manufacturing and additive manufacturing and should be selected in consideration of the material type, available technology, post-processing, accuracy, lead time, properties, and surface quality. Materials such as titanium, polyethylene, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), hydroxyapatite (HA), poly-DL-lactic acid (PDLLA), polylactide-co-glycolide acid (PLGA), and calcium phosphate are used. Design methods for the reconstruction of cranio-maxillofacial defects {{include the use of}} a pre-operative model printed with pre-operative data, printing a <b>cutting</b> guide or <b>template</b> after virtual surgery, a model after virtual surgery printed with reconstructed data using a mirror image, and manufacturing PSIs by directly obtaining PSI data after reconstruction using a mirror image. By selecting the appropriate design method, manufacturing process, and implant material according to the case, it is possible to obtain a more accurate surgical procedure, reduced operation time, the prevention of various complications that can occur using the traditional method, and predictive results compared to the traditional method.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Reconstruction of an oromandibular defect {{remains one}} of the most {{formidable}} surgical challenges faced by the reconstructive head and neck surgeon. The purpose of this study was to illustrate the added value of 3 D imaging and planning in oromandibular reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 41 -year-old dentate male patient with T 2 N 0 M 0 osteosarcoma of the mandible required segmental resection of the lateral mandible. In a virtual environment, the bony resection and reconstruction were planned preoperatively based on computed tomographic data of the head and neck and lower leg. Three custom-made templates designed in a computer-assisted design and manufacturing software package and materialized by a selective laser sintering process (DuraForm PA, 3 D Worknet, Ede, Netherlands) were used to transfer this planning to the operating theater. RESULTS: During the operative procedure, the 3 templates allowed for a rapid and accurate execution of the different surgical steps, ie, establishing the bony surgical margins and resection of the mandible (first <b>template),</b> <b>cutting</b> of the fibula while being pedicled to the leg (second template), and placement of the fibula to the donor site (third template). CONCLUSION: Computer-aided surgery and planning using the 3 -template method lead to an accurate and oncologically safe reconstruction of the mandibular geometry by eliminating intraoperative decision making, shortening ischemic time of the fibular graft, and shortening overall operative time...|$|R
40|$|Current {{techniques}} used for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) rely on conventional instrumentation (CI) systems that violate the intramedullary canals. The accuracy {{of these systems}} is questionable, and set up and assembly of their numerous pieces is time consuming. Navigation techniques are more accurate, but their broad application is limited by cost and complexity. The {{aim of this study}} was to prove a new concept of computer assisted preoperative planning to provide patient-specific templates (PST) that can replace conventional instruments. Computed tomography based planning was used to design two virtual templates. Using rapid prototyping technology, virtual templates were transferred into physical <b>templates</b> (<b>cutting</b> blocks) with surfaces that matched the distal femur and proximal tibia. Forty five TKA procedures were performed on 16 cadaveric and 29 plastic knees using the PST technique. Six out of 29 TKA procedures were included in a comparative trial against 6 procedures performed using CI systems. Computer assisted analysis of 6 random postoperative CT scans was performed to evaluate the accuracy of this technique. A reliability test was performed, in which five observers positioned the templates on a plastic knee model and a navigation system was used to measure alignment and the level of bone cutting for the planned tibial and femoral cuts. Each observer repeated the test 5 times. Errors in placement of the templates as well as intraobserver and interobserver variations were measured. The study showed that it was possible to perform all 45 TKA procedures without CI systems. There was no need for intramedullary perforation, tracking or registration. The mean time for bone cutting was 9 minutes (15 minutes for CI systems), when the surgeon had an assistant and 11 minutes (30 minutes for CI systems), when the surgeon was unassisted. Postoperative CT scans showed mean errors of 1. 70 and 0. 8 mm (maximum 2. 30 and 1. 2 mm) for alignment and bone resection respectively. The reliability test had a mean alignment error of 0. 670 (maximum 2. 50). The mean error for bone resection was 0. 32 mm (maximum 1 mm). The positioning of the templates was reliable, as there was no significant intraobserver and interobserver variation. This study proved the concept of patient-specific templating for TKA. It also showed a satisfactory level of accuracy and reliability of this technique. In conclusion, the PST technique has several advantages over conventional instrumentation and it is a simple alternative to navigation and robotic techniques for TKA. Further clinical validation is required before recommending this technique for new users. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
