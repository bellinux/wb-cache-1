Cú Roí, who has sent a contingent to the Connacht army but had not hitherto been personally involved in the recent hostilities between Ulster and Connacht, does intervene when he learns that the Ulster warrior Munremar mac Gerrginn (lit. [...] "Fatneck son of Shorthead") has come to assist Cú Chulainn in fighting the Connacht army. Since he believes no warrior in the army was able to withstand Munremar, he chooses to rally to the support of [...] "his people" [...] (muinter). The resulting encounter (comlond) between the two warriors is a spectacular stone-throwing contest, described {{from the perspective of}} the Connacht troops, who witness many stones flying in opposite directions from the east and west (Cotal and Ard Róich) and <b>colliding</b> <b>right</b> above their heads. The shower of falling rubble forces them to use their shields for protection, until on their request, Cú Roí and Munremar agree to discontinue the fight and return home. The plain strewn with stones is afterwards called Mag Clochair ("The Stony Plain").|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, the phenomenal {{progress}} {{in the development of}} ultraintense lasers has opened up many exciting new frontiers in laser matter physics, including laser plasma ion acceleration. Currently a major challenge in this frontier is to find simple methods to stably produce monoenergetic ion beams with sufficient charge for real applications. Here, we propose a novel scheme using a two color laser tweezer to fulfill this goal. In this scheme, two circularly polarized lasers with different wavelengths <b>collide</b> <b>right</b> on a thin nano-foil target containing mixed ion species. The radiation pressure of this laser pair acts like a tweezer to pinch and fully drag the electrons out, forming a stable uniform accelerating field for the ions. Scaling laws and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations confirm that high energy (10 - 1000 MeV) high charge (∼ 10 ^ 10) proton beams with narrow energy spread (∼ 4 %- 20 %) can be obtained by commercially available lasers. Such a scheme may open up a new route for compact high quality ion sources for various applications...|$|R
40|$|This article {{develops}} {{and tests}} {{a theory of}} the institutions that make property rights viable, ensuring their enforcement, mobilizing the collateral value of assets and promoting growth. In contrast to contractual rights, property rights are enforced in rem, being affected only {{with the consent of}} the right holder. This ensures enforcement but is costly when multiple, potentially <b>colliding</b> <b>rights</b> are held in the same asset. Different institutions reduce the cost of gathering consents to overcome this trade-off of enforcement benefits for consent costs: recording of deeds with title insurance, registration of rights and even a regimen of purely private transactions. All three provide functionally similar services, but their relative performance varies with the number of transactions, the risk of political opportunism and regulatory consistency. The analysis also shows the rationality of allowing competition in the preparation and support of private contracts while requiring territorial monopoly in recording and registration activities, this to ensure independence and protect third parties.

40|$|Judgments {{about right}} are {{normally}} circumscribed and balanced by other considerations {{but it is}} possible to imagine 'rights think- ing' as occurring without any such admixture. This pure rights thinking is characterized by several distinctive features. First, resentment, respect, and other passions of rectitude overrule sym- pathetic feelings of concern and compassion, love and affection. One responds simply as justice demands, never allowing extrane- ous factors to interfere with satisfaction of this moral ideal. Second, when claims of <b>rights</b> <b>collide</b> with personal attachments or calculations of benefit, the right systematically prevails. For exam- ple, rights thinking resists assertions presented to justify breaking promises to friends for their supposed greater good. Third, although rights entail obligations to their holders, responsibilities to others extend no further than these entailments within pure rights thinking. No general obligation of benevolence is recog- nized, for example, since no one in particular has a right to one's benevolence. Hence, fourth, as well as entailing moral protections for their holders and defining centres of independent agency, the perception of rights also promotes one's fundamental separateness from others...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{argues that}} the electoral {{competition}} between the New Left and the Radical Right is best understood as a cultural divide anchored in different class constituencies. Based on individual-level data from the European Social Survey, we analyze the links between voters' class position, their economic and cultural preferences and their party choice for four small and affluent European countries. We find a striking similarity in the class pattern across countries. Everywhere, the New Left attracts disproportionate support from socio-cultural professionals and presents a clear-cut middle-class profile, whereas the Radical Right is most successful among production and service workers and receives least support from professionals. In general, the Radical Right depends on the votes of lowereducated men and older citizens and {{has turned into a}} new type of working-class party. However, its success within the working-class is not due to economic, but to cultural issues. The voters of the Radical <b>Right</b> <b>collide</b> with those of the New Left over a cultural conflict of identity and community - and not over questions of redistribution. A full-grown cleavage has thus emerged in the four countries under study, separating a libertarian-universalistic pole from an authoritarian-communitarian pole and going along with a process of class realignment...|$|R
