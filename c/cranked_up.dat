Tech fumbled on their next possession, Oklahoma's Keenan Clayton recovered the fumble and return it 53yards to the Tech 3. The Sooners added another 7 points to extend their lead to 52–7. Tech <b>cranked</b> <b>up</b> its passing game on its next possession, eventually scoring a touchdown and extra point with 5:39 remaining in the third quarter. On the subsequent drive, the Red Raider defense forced their first sack on Bradford, and also forced the Sooners to punt. The Sooner defense countered in the next drive by forcing a three-and-out. The Sooner offense then added another score on a 66-yard reception by Manuel Johnson. The Tech defense blocked the extra point, and the score remained at 58–14.|$|E

500|$|... "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" [...] is a comical Halloween episode {{which was}} filmed in Auckland, New Zealand. [...] After {{shooting}} for two days, director T.J. Scott went to producer Robert Tapert and asked permission {{to alter the}} episode's artistic style to stylised rock video horror. [...] Scott said, [...] "I got the crew together and said, 'Okay guys, here we go. This {{is going to be}} a lot more vampy and fun,' and <b>cranked</b> <b>up</b> the ghetto blaster with rock music and away we went." [...] Because of the subject, Scott was able to increase the episode's level of sexual content. [...] Scott said, [...] "we did two takes that were on the edge of tasteful vampire sexuality, and we did a third take where Lucy really let loose. Of course, we all died laughing and said, 'Okay, that one is never going to make it to the screen'; we definitely pushed it too far!" [...] Ultimately, Scott felt that [...] "if you pull it too far out of context and try to take it seriously, it's a bit too rock video at times." ...|$|E

500|$|U.S. Department of State {{spokesman}} Nicholas Burns {{rejected the}} Nazi comparisons {{in the open}} letter as [...] "outrageous" [...] and distanced the U.S. government from Nazi comparisons made by the Church of Scientology, saying, [...] "We have criticized the Germans on this, but we aren't going to support the Scientologists' terror tactics against the German government." [...] Chancellor Kohl, commenting on the letter, said that those who signed it [...] "don't {{know a thing about}} Germany and don't want to know." [...] German officials argued that [...] "the whole fuss was <b>cranked</b> <b>up</b> by the Scientologists to achieve what we won't give them: tax-exempt status as a religion. This is intimidation, pure and simple." [...] Officials explained that precisely because of Germany's Nazi past, Germany took a determined stance against all [...] "radical cults and sects, including right-wing Nazi groups", and not just against Scientology. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union party denounced the letter as [...] "absurd" [...] and cited German court rulings stating that Scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a [...] "contemptuous cartel of oppression".|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Maurice Hurley {{was pleased}} with the outcome of the episode, saying [...] "The sets, the design of it and the look of that show was brilliant, I thought {{that might have been the}} best-looking show of the first season". However, he felt that the characterisations weren't quite right. This was the same opinion as that put forward by actor Brent Spiner, who portrayed both Data and Lore, who thought that Data's actions were not in line with his expectations of the character. This episode was the second and last appearance of Biff Yeager as Chief Engineer Argyle. He was the only one of the Chief Engineers introduced during the first season to appear twice, with Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) gaining the role in season two. Wil Wheaton later recalled that the stand-in actor used in this episode really irritated Spiner, and was never used again. He described the stand-in as looking like [...] "a break dancer doing the Robot" [...] whenever he had to portray Data or Lore, and said that [...] "I think the guy was really into playing an android, and his enthusiasm got <b>cranked</b> <b>up</b> to eleven, but by the end of the week, pretty much everyone wanted to deactivate him and sell him to the nearest Jawa." [...] The events of the episode would be followed up in later seasons, with the crystalline entity returning in the fifth-season episode [...] "Silicon Avatar". Brent Spiner reprised the role of Lore in the episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "".|$|E

However [...] "Acapella" [...] changed Nicholson's mind and she said, [...] "'Commander' is further evidence of this". Whilst Fraser McAlpine awarded the song four stars, his review was neither positive nor negative. He said [...] "Singers always like to sing about how brilliantly attractive and astonishing (and bossy) they are. Even if the words have a double meaning, which hints that they are merely mouthing the self-regard of a rampant egomaniac, who is laughing and rubbing his hands every time they start to sing, they don't mind. Why would they? The song mentions hair, and being {{better than the other}} ladies. That's what singers live for. [...] one extra star for the stoopid grammar switcheroo ... because of the chorus, which rules." [...] Gavin Martin of The Mirror made similar comments neither praising nor criticizing the song, instead saying it will put her [...] "firmly in control of the dance floor". Entertainment Weekly named it [...] "the number one summer jam of the year" [...] whilst music station KISS 100 called it fabulous and made it their song of the week for the week beginning May 24, 2010. A reviewer from the network said, [...] "Commander is another smash ... Kelly's taking command! With glamour set to max and drama <b>cranked</b> <b>up</b> to full power 'Commander' is proof that Kelly means business!" [...] In Fitness magazine's 100best workout songs, [...] "Commander" [...] was named one of the ten best dance workout songs for its bouncy 125beats per minute composition.|$|E

2500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "faithful, intelligent, admirably acted, superbly shot" [...] and added, [...] "It {{also offers a}} near-perfect case study {{of the ways in}} which film is {{incapable}} of capturing certain crucial literary qualities, in this case the very things that elevate the book from being a merely insightful study of a deteriorating marriage into a remarkable one... Even when the dramatic temperature is <b>cranked</b> <b>up</b> too high, the picture's underpinnings seem only partly present, to the point where one suspects that what it's reaching for dramatically might be all but unattainable—perhaps approachable only by Pinter at his peak." [...] McCarthy later significantly qualified his review, calling Revolutionary Road [...] "problematic" [...] and that it [...] "has some issues that just won't go away". He concludes that Revolutionary Road suffers in comparison to Billy Wilder's The Apartment and Richard Quine's Strangers When We Meet because of its [...] "narrow vision", even arguing that the television series Mad Men handles the issues of conformity, frustration, and hypocrisy [...] "with more panache and precision".|$|E

The kaleidoscopic imagery momentarily topples into live action for the baffling climax...", an assessment echoed by critic Mark Schilling. Mike Crandol of Anime News Network gave the film an overall passing grade and described it as [...] "a visual marvel". He described the DVD release as [...] "a mixed bag", expressing displeasure over the [...] "unremarkable" [...] video presentation and overall lack of extra material. David Uzumeri of ComicsAlliance summarized the film as [...] "a dark, brutal, psychedelic orgy of sex and violence that culminated in the mass extinction of humanity set to an optimistic J-pop song with lyrics about suicide." [...] Uzumeri also stated that the [...] "themes of [...] criticizing the audience for being spineless and lost in a fantasy world were <b>cranked</b> <b>up</b> to eleven, as the protagonist Shinji basically watches everybody die around him due to his refusal to make any effort whatsoever to engage with other people." ...|$|E

Trainer Todd Pletcher entered two horses, with Neolithic assigned to set a fast early pace in the hopes of tiring Gun Runner, while Rally Cry was intended to close from behind. The race went much as expected, with Gun Runner stalking Neolithic for the first 6 furlongs before swinging to the lead on the far turn. Gun Runner maintained his momentum and eventually won by [...] lengths over the late-closing Rally Cry. His time of 1:47.43 was the fastest Woodward Stakes since the race was moved to Saratoga in 2006 and earned Gun Runner a career high Beyer Speed Figure of 115. He was also given a Timeform US rating of 142, the highest Timeform US rating ever achieved. [...] "That was better than the Whitney, just stronger, faster overall," [...] said Geroux.

[...] "Rise Above" [...] is a trademark soaring U2 ballad, with [...] the elegant grandeur <b>cranked</b> <b>up</b> to Andrew Lloyd Webber levels. But show tunes need big voices too, and, singing next to Bono on this version from the forthcoming cast recording album, leading man Reeve Carney sounds like a nervous understudy." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album one star, stating that all the problems that plagued the production [...] "obscured one key problem with the musical: the songs written by Bono and The Edge are dreadful." [...] Erlewine summed up his review calling the songs a [...] "murky, turgid mess, too concerned with atmosphere and narrative to reel in a listener and ironically not offering ambience or story enough {{to suggest that the}} musical would entertain." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{their next}} drive, the Redskins moved the ball 73 yards in 12 plays to the Raiders 7-yard line, with Joe Theismann {{completing}} a 17-yard pass to receiver Alvin Garrett and three passes to tight end Clint Didier for 50 yards. [...] However, linebacker Rod Martin broke up Theismann's third-down pass attempt, forcing Washington {{to settle for}} a 24-yard field goal by Moseley. [...] Los Angeles took the ensuing kickoff and drove 41 yards to the Redskins 39-yard line. [...] The drive stalled when Plunkett's third-down pass fell incomplete, but Ray Guy's 27-yard punt pinned Washington back at their own 12-yard line with 12 seconds left in the half. [...] From there, head coach Joe Gibbs had Theismann run a screen play called [...] "Rocket Screen", but Raiders linebacker Jack Squirek intercepted the pass and returned it for a touchdown to give the Raiders a 21–3 halftime lead. The defense was prepared for the play, as Theismann had successfully completed an identical screen pass to Joe Washington for a 67-yard gain in their 37–35 victory over the Raiders on October 2. [...] In fact, Los Angeles linebackers coach Charlie Sumner had sent Squirek onto the field as a last-second substitution specifically to cover Washington. [...] "I was mad," [...] said linebacker Matt Millen, who had to run off the field to avoid a penalty. [...] "I'd called a blitz, and I was <b>cranked</b> <b>up</b> for it, but he told Jack to play the screen and sent him in. I guess Charlie knows what he's doing, huh?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{story of}} the longest 16 seconds in league history would happen in 1980 {{featuring}} the Toyota Tamaraws and the U/Tex Wranglers. The two teams tangled in the Finals of the Open Conference title with U/Tex having the privilege of playing their two imports {{side by side with}} each other. The two, Glenn McDonald and Aaron James, combined forces with Bogs Adornado, Lim Eng Beng and the diminutive Ricky Pineda to form a solid starting unit. Toyota of course had their resident import Andy Fields partnered with another old reliable in King. In Game 4 of the series and U/Tex ahead 2-1, Tommy Manotoc pulled out all his starters and sent in his shock troopers with more than 7 minutes remaining in the game and the Tamaraws up by only 9 points. Reporters bitterly criticized Manotoc's move for conceding the game at such an early stage, but Manotoc justified this by saying the most famous quote, [...] "one step backwards, two steps forward" [...] in reference to the tactic of relieving his star players and giving them enough time to rest in preparation for the all important Game 5. Toyota won Game 4 handily of course. In Game 5, with time down to 16 seconds, U/Tex in possession and Toyota ahead by four 94-90, the 16-second miracle happened. Upon receipt of the inbound pass from Lim Eng Beng, Aaron James <b>cranked</b> <b>up</b> a jumper from 18 feet to bring the game closer by 2, time down to 11 seconds. Toyota had possession, inbounded from the endline, but the full court press of U/Tex somehow added pressure to the Tamaraws. Instead of just holding on to the ball and waiting for a foul while watching the time tick away, the Tamaraws made one hurried pass after another until it reached the frontcourt. In the ensuing play, Arnie Tuadles made a pass to Abe King, who was unmolested in the paint, but his pass was read well by McDonald, who intercepted the ball. Francis Arnaiz, in haste, fouled McDonald in penalty instead of putting up a solid defense against the 6-foot, 6-inch former Celtic. McDonald, in his characteristically cool demeanor, proving once and again that his 1976 championship performance with Boston was no fluke, sank both free throws with time down to 2 seconds left. The game was tied and Toyota couldn't buy a basket in the remaining seconds, forcing the game into overtime, the very first recorded OT in Game 5 in PBA History (and probably the only one to date). At the end of 5 minutes of extension, U/Tex saw itself at the winning end with a 99-98 victory against the hapless Tamaraws which never know what hit them.|$|E
