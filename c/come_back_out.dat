500|$|Troy Middleton was out dove {{hunting with}} his son, Troy Jr., {{and a friend}} on Sunday morning, 7 December 1941. Having had a {{successful}} morning, the trio {{decided to take a}} break for lunch, then <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> and get their bag limits in the afternoon. When they arrived at home for the mid-day meal, Mrs. Middleton greeted them with the news of the attack on Pearl Harbor. This {{put an end to the}} dove hunting, and Troy Middleton began to make plans. [...] The next day he reported to the LSU president announcing his intention to offer his services to the U.S. Army, and he sent a telegram to the War Department announcing his availability for service. Within a day or so he received a reply: [...] he would report to active duty as a lieutenant colonel on 20 January 1942, allowing him time to get his affairs in order.|$|E
500|$|Following the race, Mercedes apologised to Hamilton for the pit call, which {{commentators}} such as F1Fanatic's Keith Collantine, Formula One {{correspondent for}} The Guardian Paul Weaver, and former Formula One driver David Coulthard felt cost him the victory. Team boss Toto Wolff told the press: [...] "We got our numbers wrong. We {{thought we had}} the gap for Lewis to take fresh tyres and <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> in the lead behind the safety car, ahead of Nico and covering off any risk of another competitor taking fresh tyres. But the calculation was incorrect and he came out in third place." [...] Indeed, {{more than half of}} the teams made a pit stop at least one car when the safety car was deployed, just as Hamilton did. However, he as race leader caught up with the safety car quicker and lost a considerably larger amount of time on his way into the pit lane, leading to him coming out behind Rosberg and Vettel.|$|E

50|$|The green flag <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> on lap 194. Luyendyk passed Goodyear on the backstretch to {{take the}} lead. Just two laps later, the yellow was brought out again {{for a piece of}} debris (Lazier's right-side {{rear-view}} mirror broke in turn 2). Luyendyk still led as the green <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> at the conclusion of lap 197 (three laps to go).|$|R

2500|$|The {{legend of}} the wind blowing around the cathedral is as follows: In olden days, the Devil flew over the ground, riding the wind. Thus he {{caught a glimpse of}} his {{portrait}} carved onto the cathedral: the Tempter, courting the foolish virgins (...) , {{in the guise of a}} seductive young man. It is true that his back opens up and toads and snakes come out of it, but none of the naïve girls notices that [...] nor do many tourists for that matter. Very flattered and curious, the Devil had the idea to enter to see whether there were other sculptures representing him on the inside of the cathedral. Taken captive inside the holy place, he could not <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>out.</b> The wind always waits in the square and still howls today from impatience on the places outside the cathedral. The Devil, furious, makes air currents from the bottom of the church to the height of the pillar of angels.|$|E
2500|$|... 14 And {{they found}} {{written in the}} Law, how that the [...] had {{commanded}} by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in {{the feast of the}} seventh month; 15 and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying: 'Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.' 16 So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim. 17 And all the congregation of them that were <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths; for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said he, {{putting aside}} his bowl, {{and looking at}} her dreamily. It seemed as if this young prattling thing were some memory <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> of his own youth.|$|E

6000|$|He spoke more vehemently now, {{for there}} was {{something}} in Crystal's calm attitude which had begun to chill him. Had he not been in deadly danger all the day?

60|$|Feeling {{moderately}} {{sure that}} this was the animal his uncle had seen, and that the deer would not go far, but might even <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> of curiosity, Earl began to climb the cliff. A profusion of brush grew among the rocks, and these afforded him a good hand-hold, and he was soon at the top.|$|E

60|$|As for Michael, he accepted, without surprise, the indubitable {{fact that}} Jerry had <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> of the Nothingness. Things {{of this sort}} had begun to happen rapidly, {{but it was not}} the things themselves, but the connotations of them, that almost stunned him. If the man and woman, whom he had last seen at Tulagi, and, likewise, Jerry, had come back from the Nothingness, then could come, and might come at any moment, the beloved Steward.|$|E
60|$|All {{the time}} he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and down the tavern on his crutch, {{slapping}} tables with his hand, and giving such a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge or a Bow Street runner. My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on finding Black Dog at the Spy-glass, and I watched the cook narrowly. But he was too deep, and too ready, and too clever for me, {{and by the time the}} two men had <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd, and been scolded like thieves, I would have gone bail for the innocence of Long John Silver.|$|E
60|$|I saw {{him when}} I {{was out on}} that Missouri trip four years ago. He was old then--though not quite so old as I--and the burden of life was upon him. He said his granddaughter, twelve years old, had read my books {{and would like to}} see me. It was a pathetic time, for she was a {{prisoner}} in her room and marked for death. And John knew that she was passing swiftly away. Twelve years old--just her grandfather's age when he rode away on that great journey with his yellow hair flapping behind him. In her I seemed to see that boy again. It {{was as if he had}} <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> of that remote past and was present before me in his golden youth. Her malady was heart disease, and her brief life came to a close a few days later.|$|E

60|$|I {{felt good}} and all washed clean of sin {{for the first}} time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn't do it {{straight}} off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the ONLY one he's got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.|$|E
6000|$|TRULY {{was there}} {{something}} high, generous, and noble in the native composition of our poor old Hepzibah! Or else,--and it was quite as probably the case,--she had been enriched by poverty, developed by sorrow, elevated by the strong and solitary affection of her life, and thus endowed with heroism, which never could have characterized her in what are called happier circumstances. Through dreary years Hepzibah had looked forward--for the most part despairingly, never with any confidence of hope, but always with the feeling {{that it was her}} brightest possibility--to the very position in which she now found herself. In her own behalf, she had asked nothing of Providence but the opportunity of devoting herself to this brother, whom she had so loved,--so admired for what he was, or might have been,--and to whom she had kept her faith, alone of all the world, wholly, unfalteringly, at every instant, and throughout life. And here, in his late decline, the lost one had <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>out</b> of his long and strange misfortune, and was thrown on her sympathy, as it seemed, not merely for the bread of his physical existence, but for everything that should keep him morally alive. [...] She had responded to the call. She had come forward,--our poor, gaunt Hepzibah, in her rusty silks, with her rigid joints, and the sad perversity of her scowl,--ready to do her utmost; and with affection enough, if that were all, to do a hundred times as much! There could be few more tearful sights,--and Heaven forgive us if a smile insist on mingling with our conception of it!--few sights with truer pathos in them, than Hepzibah presented on that first afternoon.|$|E
