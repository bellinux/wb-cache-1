25|$|On Saturday, 20 November {{the party}} {{set off on}} a two-day navigational {{exercise}} to cross the <b>Cairngorm</b> Plateau from Cairn Gorm south to Ben Macdui. Because they were very late in starting (it was almost 11:00 when they left Lagganlia) they used the <b>Cairngorm</b> ski lift {{to get close to}} the plateau and then, as planned, they separated into two groups – the more experienced group led by Beattie set off and was followed by the group led by Davidson and Sunderland. After crossing the plateau both groups were to descend to the Corrour Bothy at a much lower level in the Lairig Ghru where they would spend the night – sunset was just before 16:00. The less-experienced group of 15-year-olds would then return along the Lairig Ghru while the other group would return by traversing Cairn Toul and Braeriach {{on the far side of}} the valley. In case of emergency each group was to go to the Curran shelter high on the plateau. This plan had been approved in advance by the head of Lagganlia, John Paisley, who could forbid unsuitable expeditions.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{returning}} to Great Britain, the Scots Greys found themselves {{subject to the}} problems {{that the rest of}} the British Army were going through in that era. In 1933, the regiment took part in a recruiting drive by conducting a march through Scotland, including a three-day traverse of the <b>Cairngorm</b> Mountains to get better publicity. Although budgets were lean, the Scots Greys, like other British cavalry regiments, were finally re-equipped. Each troop would now contain an automatic weapons section.|$|E

Her outward passage was the quickest {{recorded}} to date, reaching Mauritius in 40 days and Singapore in 60. The whole journey from Liverpool to Hong Kong took 65 days. This beat the fastest tea clipper outward passage of 77 days by the <b>Cairngorm</b> in 1853.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Cairngorm</b> Plateau Disaster {{occurred}} in November 1971 when six fifteen-year-old Edinburgh {{school students and}} their two leaders were on a navigational expedition in a remote area of the Scottish mountains. When the weather deteriorated they adopted their emergency plan {{and headed for the}} Curran shelter, but they failed to reach it and became stranded for two nights on the high plateau in a blizzard. Five children and the leader's assistant died of exposure. A sixth student and the group's leader survived the ordeal with severe hypothermia and frostbite. The tragedy, also often called the Feith Buidhe Disaster, is regarded as Britain's worst mountaineering accident.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} day, on the Sunday, Beattie's {{group had}} great difficulty {{getting out of}} the hut because of the deep snow and in arduous conditions they were scarcely able to descend from the plateau. At 16:30 they reached Rothiemurchus Hut where they were able to telephone Lagganlia and they met their transport vehicle at 17:30. The children were returned to Lagganlia while Beattie and Paisley drove to the ski centre where they were unable to learn any news. They then went to Glenmore Lodge and then Aviemore police station where at 19:00 they reported Davidson's party missing. Three pairs of rescuers were immediately dispatched from Glenmore Lodge into the blizzard and the night and the <b>Cairngorm,</b> RAF Kinloss, Braemar and Aberdeen MRTs were called out. The mountain rescue teams made their preparations so they could start off hours before first light on Monday.|$|E

500|$|James Hutton (1726–1797), the [...] "father {{of modern}} geology", {{was born in}} Edinburgh. His Theory of the Earth, {{published}} in 1788, proposed {{the idea of a}} rock cycle in which weathered rocks form new sediments and that granites were of volcanic origin. At Glen Tilt in the <b>Cairngorm</b> mountains he found granite penetrating metamorphic schists. This showed to him that granite formed from the cooling of molten rock, not precipitation out of water as the Neptunists of the time believed. This sight is said to have [...] "filled him with delight". Regarding geological time scales he famously remarked [...] "that we find no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end".|$|E
500|$|Several {{accidents}} {{occurred during}} {{the production of the}} film. While filming at Wollaton Hall, Nottingham, a tractor-trailer crashed into the main entrance, though no one was injured. A stuntman parachutist later crashed through the roof of a home in <b>Cairngorm</b> Gliding Club, Feshiebridge in Scotland, and became wedged there after a failed landing during a skydiving stunt; he was not seriously injured. While filming scenes in Pittsburgh, Hathaway's stunt double crashed into an IMAX camera while filming a sequence that required her to ride a Batpod {{down a flight of stairs}} during a riot. There were no injuries, but the camera was destroyed. A second accident took place in Pittsburgh when the truck carrying the then-unidentified vehicle later termed [...] "the Bat" [...] went off-course and crashed into a lighting array, damaging the model of the aircraft. Production was delayed while the model was repaired.|$|E

Both contractors immediately started bagging stone from high up Ben Nevis to be brought down to by helicopter to replace crumbling steps and stabilise eroding parts of the path. The project will eventually upgrade 3.5km of the mountain track from the starting point at Achintee {{all the way up}} to John's Wall; this year the maintenance was focused on a difficult middle section which was most in need of attention. After six months of hard work and battling with the weather, the contractors have now upgraded 1km of the mountain track which is roughly 30% of the overall maintenance this project will carry out. The next contracted works will resume towards the end of September, after the Ben Nevis Race, for stage two of the project.|$|E

2500|$|The {{recommendation}} {{concerning the}} possible removal of high-level shelters {{was to become}} a cause of major disagreement. Traditional [...] "bothies" [...] were built for stalkers and gamekeepers and were in the valleys. The shelters being questioned were modern ones built on the plateau. The argument to keep them was that any shelter in an emergency was better than none – <b>Cairngorm</b> MRT, Banffshire County Council and local estate owners were of this opinion. However the Braemar MRT, most mountaineering bodies, the Chief Constable of police and Adam Watson thought they should be removed. More and more experts and politicians became involved and in July 1973 the Secretary of State for Scotland launched a formal consultation. Eventually the Scottish Office decided it had no powers in the matter. In February 1974 at a meeting which excluded everyone except the local authority, police, and mountaineering experts, a decision for removal was taken and after further argument they were indeed removed.|$|E

There are mountain peaks on the individual plateaux between the valleys but these are the eroded stumps of once much higher mountains – they are not much higher now than the plateaux themselves. Between two of these valleys, the Lairig Ghru and the Lairig an Laoigh, extends the <b>Cairngorm</b> Plateau of granite boulders and gravel where Cairn Gorm itself and the [...] Ben Macdui – the highest mountain in the Cairngorms and the second highest in the British Isles – are the main summits.

2500|$|The National Museum of Ireland {{is clearly}} not correct in saying that the fashion began after Queen Victoria was {{presented}} with {{a replica of the}} [...] "Cavan Brooch" [...] on her visit to Dublin to see the Great Industrial Exhibition in 1853; the Royal Collection has two brooches that Prince Albert bought for her from West & Son in 1849 on an earlier visit to Dublin, which were already being made in editions. [...] Albert presented them in November and at Christmas that year: [...] "...such beautiful souvenirs, both made after those very curious old Irish ornaments we saw in the College in Dublin, one a silver shawl brooch, in smaller size than the original" [...] was her reaction to the November gift. [...] A later gift from Albert included a setting of a <b>cairngorm</b> he had picked up when walking in the Scottish Highlands, a more authentic type of gem than the brightly coloured foreign stones used in much Celtic Revival jewellery.|$|E
2500|$|Rainfall totals {{vary widely}} across Scotlandthe western {{highlands}} of Scotland {{are one of}} the wettest places in the UK with annual rainfall up to [...] Due to the mountainous topography of the western Highlands, this type of precipitation is orographic in nature, with the warm, wet air forced to rise on contact with the mountainous coast, where it consequently, cools and condenses, forming clouds. In comparison, much of eastern Scotland receives less than [...] annually; lying in the rain shadow of the western uplands. The town of Dunbar, east of Edinburgh, has an annual rainfall of merely 560.18mm (22.05in), less than Barcelona. Snowfall is less common in the lowlands, but becomes more common with altitude. Parts of the Highlands have an average of 36 to 60 snow days per year, while some western coastal areas have between 0 and 6 days with snow a year. Scotland's snowiest spot is the <b>Cairngorm</b> mountain range.|$|E
2500|$|The plateau {{area has}} a subarctic climate and only {{supports}} sparse tundra. The shattered terrain {{is more like}} the high ground in high-arctic Canada or northern Norway than anywhere in the Alps or Rockies. The weather often deteriorates rapidly with altitude so that, when there are moderate conditions 150 metres below the plateau, the top can be stormy or misty and there can be icy or powdery snow. Even when no snow is falling the wind can whip up lying snow to produce white-out conditions for a few metres above the surface and snowdrifts can build up rapidly in sheltered places. Gravel can be blown {{through the air and}} walking can be impossible. Adam Watson says [...] "When a gale is accompanied by thick storms of ground drift, or worse, by heavy falling blizzards plus ground drift, or worse still by mist as well, conditions can be extremely serious on the plateau, making it suffocating and difficult to breathe, hard to open your eyes, impossible to see anything beyond your own feet, and unable to communicate with your party except one at a time by cupping an ear and shouting into it."

2500|$|Minerva McGonagall is deputy Headmistress, head of Gryffindor House, Transfiguration professor, {{and later}} Headmistress at Hogwarts, where she began {{teaching}} in December 1956.

McGonagall {{is described as a}} tall, rather severe-looking woman, with black hair typically drawn into a tight bun. She wears emerald green robes, a pointed hat, and always has a very prim expression. She speaks with a slight Scottish accent. She is, according to Rowling, a sprightly 70-year-old. McGonagall wears square spectacles that match the markings around the eyes of her Animagus form of a British Shorthair silver tabby cat; she has the distinction of being the first Animagus introduced in the series and being one of the few registered Animagi of the century, though she was rarely seen using the ability. Harry's immediate impression of her is of someone who is not to be crossed. She has a fondness for tartan, and her handkerchief, at least one hat, dressing gown, and dress robes are patterned with it. In the films, McGonagall often wears a Scottish brooch of a specific Scots style set with <b>Cairngorm</b> citrines and Scottish agate.|$|E

We found, on calling for mamma at St. Giles's, that she had gone away; but she rejoined us between four and five o'clock at our hotel, where the next thing we did was to dine.

60|$|I {{had turned}} {{off from the}} Edgware Road into a street leading west, the {{atmosphere}} of which had appealed to me. It {{was a place of}} quiet houses standing behind little gardens. They had the usual names printed on the stuccoed gateposts. The fading twilight was just sufficient to enable one to read them.

60|$|I had recollections, too, of {{fair and}} fertile holms, or level plains, {{extending}} between the wooded {{banks and the}} bold stream of the Clyde, which, coloured like pure amber, or rather having the hue of the pebbles called <b>Cairngorm,</b> rushes over sheets of rock and beds of gravel, inspiring a species of awe from the few and faithless fords which it presents, {{and the frequency of}} fatal accidents, now diminished by the number of bridges. These alluvial holms were frequently bordered by triple and quadruple rows of large trees, which gracefully marked their boundary, and dipped their long arms into the foaming stream of the river. Other places I remembered, which had been described by the old huntsman as the lodge of tremendous wild-cats, or the spot where tradition stated the mighty stag to have been brought to bay, or where heroes, whose might was now as much forgotten, were said to have been slain by surprise, or in battle.|$|E
