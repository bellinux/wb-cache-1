5|$|The tengu of {{this period}} were often {{conceived}} of as the ghosts of the arrogant, {{and as a result}} the creatures have become strongly associated with vanity and pride. Today the Japanese expression tengu ni naru ("becoming a tengu") is still used to describe a <b>conceited</b> person.|$|E
5|$|Philo of Alexandria, Josephus and Seneca {{state that}} Caligula was insane, but {{describe}} this madness as a personality trait {{that came through}} experience. Seneca states that Caligula became arrogant, angry and insulting once becoming emperor and uses his personality flaws as examples his readers can learn from. According to Josephus, power made Caligula incredibly <b>conceited</b> and led him {{to think he was}} a god. Philo of Alexandria reports that Caligula became ruthless after nearly dying of an illness in the eighth month of his reign in AD 37. Juvenal reports he was given a magic potion that drove him insane.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Uncle Vernon punishes Harry, fitting locks to {{his bedroom}} door and bars to the windows. However, Ron Weasley arrives with his twin {{brothers}} Fred and George in their father Arthur’s enchanted Ford Anglia and they rescue Harry, who stays at their family home, the Burrow, {{for the remainder of}} his holidays. Harry and the other Weasleys—mother Molly, third eldest son Percy, and daughter Ginny (who has a crush on Harry)—travel to Diagon Alley. There, they are reunited with Hermione Granger and introduced to Lucius Malfoy, father of Harry’s school nemesis Draco, and Gilderoy Lockhart, a <b>conceited</b> autobiographer who has been appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor after the death of Professor Quirrel. When Harry and Ron approach Platform 9 3/4 in King's Cross station it refuses to allow them pass; instead, they fly Arthur’s car to Hogwarts, where they crash into a sentient willow tree on the grounds.|$|E
5|$|Another {{close friend}} of SpongeBob is Sandy Cheeks, a {{squirrel}} from Texas. She is a scientist and an expert in karate. She lives in an oak tree entrapped in a clear glass dome locked by an airtight, hand-turned seal. When outside of her dwelling, she wears an astronaut-like suit because she cannot breathe underwater. Mr. Krabs, a miserly crab obsessed with money, {{is the owner of}} the Krusty Krab restaurant and SpongeBob's boss. Krabs has a teenage whale daughter named Pearl, whom he values equally with his riches. His rival, Plankton, is a small green copepod who owns a low-rank fast-food restaurant called the Chum Bucket, located {{across the street from the}} Krusty Krab. Plankton spends most of his time planning to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers, so as to gain the upper hand and put the Krusty Krab out of business. The majority of Plankton's plans come from his intelligent yet sarcastic computer wife Karen, who is more competent and less <b>conceited</b> than him. When SpongeBob is not working at the Krusty Krab, he can often be found at Mrs. Puff's boating school (the underwater equivalent of a driver's education course). SpongeBob is perpetually unable to pass Mrs. Puff's exams, which is why he almost always walks around town.|$|E
25|$|Richthofen {{met with}} Manstein on 28 April, and largely got on with Manstein. Despite being <b>conceited</b> personalities, they both {{genuinely}} respected each other. Though {{on one occasion}} Richthofen claimed in his diary to have taken great delight in beating Manstein in a debate over tactical differences. Manstein and Richthofen determined that the limited land forces available made cooperation between land and air forces critical. The main points of effort were discussed and each man's staff was ordered to deal directly {{with each other to}} facilitate rapid cooperation.|$|E
25|$|In 1863, Charles Cowden Clarke {{also wrote}} on this play. Kehler notes {{he was the}} husband of famous Shakespearean scholar Mary Cowden Clarke. Charles was more appreciative of the lower-class {{mechanicals}} of the play. He commented favourably on their individualisation and their collective richness of character. He thought that Bottom was <b>conceited</b> but good natured, and shows a considerable store of imagination in his interaction with {{the representatives of the}} fairy world. He also argued that Bottom's conceit was a quality inseparable from his secondary profession, that of an actor.|$|E
25|$|Three years later, Ernest Bevin, Minister of Labour in {{the wartime}} National government, invited Beveridge {{to take charge}} of the Welfare {{department}} of his Ministry. Beveridge refused, but declared an interest in organising British manpower in wartime (Beveridge had come to favour a strong system of centralised planning). Bevin was reluctant to let Beveridge have his way but did commission him to work on a relatively unimportant manpower survey from June 1940 and so Beveridge became a temporary civil servant. Neither Bevin nor the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry Sir Thomas Phillips liked working with Beveridge as both found him <b>conceited.</b>|$|E
25|$|The fable of Arachne is a late Roman {{addition}} to Classical Greek mythology {{that does not}} appear in any Greek texts from the Classical Era or in the myth repertoire of the Attic vase-painters. Arachne's name means spider in ancient Greek. According to Ovid, Arachne was the daughter of a famous dyer in Tyrian purple in Hypaipa of Lydia, and a weaving student of Athena. She became so <b>conceited</b> of her skill as a weaver that she began claiming that her skill was greater than that of Athena herself. Athena gave Arachne a chance to redeem herself by assuming the form of an old woman and warning Arachne not to offend the deities. Arachne scoffed and wished for a weaving contest, so she could prove her skill.|$|E
25|$|Cameron James, a new {{student at}} Padua High School in the Seattle area, becomes {{instantly}} smitten with popular sophomore Bianca Stratford. Geeky Michael Eckman warns him that Bianca is vapid and <b>conceited,</b> {{and that her}} overprotective father does not allow Bianca or her older sister, the shrewish Kat, to date. Kat, a senior, is accepted to Sarah Lawrence College in New York, but her father, Walter, wants her {{to stay close to}} home. Bianca wishes to date affluent senior Joey Donner, but Walter, an obstetrician worrisome of teenage pregnancy, will not allow his daughters to date until they graduate. Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's antisocial attitude makes this unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Efforts to {{establish}} the play's date of composition are complicated by its uncertain relationship with another Elizabethan play with an almost identical plot but different wording and character names, A Pleasant <b>Conceited</b> Historie, called the taming of a Shrew. The Shrews exact relationship with A Shrew is unknown. Different theories suggest A Shrew could be a reported text of a performance of The Shrew, a source for The Shrew, an early draft (possibly reported) of The Shrew, or an adaptation of The Shrew. A Shrew was entered in the Stationers' Register on 2 May 1594, suggesting that whatever {{the relationship between the}} two plays, The Shrew was most likely written somewhere between 1590 (roughly when Shakespeare arrived in London) and 1594 (registration of A Shrew).|$|E
25|$|At Midtown High School in Queens, New York, local {{teenager}} Peter Parker gives a book {{report about}} Arachne, Goddess of the Weavers ("The Myth of Arachne"). As Peter gives his report, Arachne descends {{to the stage}} and tells the audience her story ("Behold and Wonder"). Thousands of years ago, Arachne was a skilled weaver who became <b>conceited</b> and boasted that she was greater than the goddess Athena, who challenged Arachne to a weaving contest. During the contest, Arachne created blasphemous images of the gods. Furious, Athena destroyed Arachne's work. Devastated, Arachne hung herself, but Athena took pity on Arachne and transformed her into the world's first spider. Now Arachne is cursed to wander the universe and weave her web for all eternity.|$|E
25|$|Tony Stonem (Nicholas Hoult) is an attractive, {{intelligent}} and popular boy. His manipulative ways often go unnoticed by many, {{and are a}} catalyst {{for the majority of}} the events in the series. Sid Jenkins (Mike Bailey) is Tony's best friend and has an entirely opposite personality. He lacks confidence, is socially uneasy and struggles with school work. Tony's girlfriend is Michelle Richardson (April Pearson), a girl who can never stay angry at his mischievous behaviour for long. Outwardly, Michelle appears shallow, vain and <b>conceited,</b> but she works hard, has a strong interest in French and Spanish, and is very emotionally mature. She is friends with Cassie Ainsworth (Hannah Murray), an eccentric girl who suffers from an eating disorder. Cassie attempts to hide her own struggles with mental health while her flamboyant parents ignore her in favour of their new baby.|$|E
25|$|If {{the reader}} has also {{received}} {{the benefit of}} the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound <b>conceited,</b> contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.|$|E
25|$|After {{the hero}} Houyi shot down {{nine of the}} ten suns, he was {{pronounced}} king by the thankful people. However, he soon became a <b>conceited</b> and tyrannical ruler. In order to live long without death, he asked for the elixir from Xiwangmu. But his wife, Chang'e, stole it on the fifteenth of August {{because she did not}} want the cruel king to live long and hurt more people. She took the magic potion to prevent her husband from becoming immortal. Houyi was so angry when discovered that Chang'e took the elixir, he shot at his wife as she flew toward the moon, though he missed. Chang'e fled to the moon and became the spirit of the moon. Houyi died soon because he was overcome with great anger. Thereafter, people offer a sacrifice to Chang'e on every lunar fifteenth of August to commemorate Chang'e's action.|$|E
25|$|On August 15, 2004, Benoit was {{defeated}} by Randy Orton for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam. Benoit then teamed with William Regal at Unforgiven against Ric Flair and Batista in a winning effort. Benoit then feuded with Edge (who had turned into an arrogant and <b>conceited</b> heel), leading to Taboo Tuesday where Benoit, Edge, and Shawn Michaels were all put into a poll to see who would face Triple H for the World Heavyweight title that night. Michaels received the most votes and as a result, Edge and Benoit were forced to team up to face the then tag team champions, La Résistance, in the same night. However, Edge deserted Benoit during the match and Benoit was forced to take on both members of La Résistance by himself. He still managed to win the World Tag Team title. At Survivor Series, Benoit sided with Randy Orton's team while Edge teamed with Triple H's team, and while Edge was able to pin Benoit after a Pedigree, Orton's team won.|$|E
25|$|Ranma goes {{to school}} with Akane at , where he meets his {{recurring}} opponent Tatewaki Kuno, the <b>conceited</b> kendo team captain who aggressively pursues Akane, but also {{falls in love with}} Ranma's female form without ever discovering his curse (despite most other characters knowing it). Nerima serves as a backdrop for more martial arts mayhem with the introduction of Ranma's regular rivals, such as the eternally lost Ryoga Hibiki who traveled halfway across Japan getting from the front of his house to the back, where Ranma spent three days waiting for him. Ryoga, seeking revenge on Ranma, followed him to Jusenkyo where he ultimately falls into the Spring of Drown Piglet. Now when splashed with cold water he {{takes the form of a}} little black pig. Not knowing this, Akane takes the piglet as a pet and names it P-chan, but Ranma knows and hates him for keeping this secret and taking advantage of the situation. Another rival is the nearsighted Mousse, who also falls into a cursed spring and becomes a duck when he gets wet, and finally, there is Ranma's impish grandmaster, Happosai, who spends his time stealing the underwear of schoolgirls.|$|E
25|$|Himani Singh {{is played}} by Gurdeep Punj. She is Avatar's wife {{and the mother of}} Rohan, Dolly, Sunny, Nikki, and Bobby. She works as a {{hospital}} nurse and is often portrayed as dutiful, protective, and comedic. She loves her family and does everything to care for and protect them. She appears out of her element when she isn't nurturing them, especially Nikki, but as the series progresses, she begins to feel assured that her youngest children are in good hands and trusts that her husband and three elder children can look after Nikki and Bobby. She is notoriously <b>conceited</b> and enjoys bragging about her accomplishments, be they admirable, real, or otherwise. Himani used to work on the local news team and was also a poet in her high-school days. A running gag on the show is that she was involved in virtually every extracurricular activity at Arya College of Arts and Science, but still earned a nursing degree. She lets special opportunities go to her head, such as being on TV or singing in front of a group. She has a habit of taking any chance at publicity that may shine on her family to focus on her, but this never works out well; usually she ends up being cut from the project or tossed out of certain groups. Himani seldom accepts her children's misbehavior. It is revealed in the third special that she is pregnant again with her fifth child. In the middle of the third season, Himani quit her nursing job to be a stay-at-home mother to Nikki and Bobby. Himani is the equivalent of Amy Duncan in Good Luck Charlie, who {{is played by}} Leigh-Allyn Baker.|$|E
500|$|The {{audiobook}} {{was also}} well received. Publishers Weekly commented that [...] "Robbie Daymond’s narration is delightful: lively and comical, he perfectly captures the lovably <b>conceited</b> and pompous Apollo". The AudioFile review also praised Daymond’s performance, saying that [...] "Riordan's funny writing and Daymond's narration {{make sure the}} listener is always on Apollo's side as he learns how to manage without his godly gifts." ...|$|E

500|$|Thenceforth, Frederick and the [...] "ferocious and demonlike" [...] horse, {{which no}} one else but Frederick has dared to touch since its arrival, become {{seemingly}} inseparable. Day after day, Metzengerstein rides the animal as if addicted, and he becomes less and less interested {{in the affairs of}} his house and of society. He eventually begins to live in seclusion to the extent that others in the neighborhood suspect that he is either mad, sick, or overwhelmingly <b>conceited.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Cloten, [...] "the <b>conceited,</b> booby lord", is discussed as {{an occasion for}} noting how Shakespeare depicted what is most contradictory in human nature. Cloten, [...] "with all the absurdity of his person and manners, is not without shrewdness in his observations." [...] And again Hazlitt steps back and points out how Shakespeare set one {{character of}}f against the other and presented characters of similar types but with slight modifications of their otherwise similar traits to convey a certain impression about human nature. Hazlitt observes: ...|$|E
500|$|Within a few months, Vince officially {{became a}} star. However, Peggy {{is no longer}} on {{speaking}} terms with Vince, as his success has made him arrogant. Vince then signs a movie deal with Climax Studios. The studio head asks him {{to spend the day}} with Sherry Wilson (Jennifer Holden), the studio's new leading lady, for publicity purposes. The <b>conceited</b> actress is less than thrilled with her co-star at first; but she eventually falls in love with Vince after shooting a kissing scene, saying that she's [...] "come all unglued" [...] (indicating that she's no longer [...] "stuck up").|$|E
500|$|Years {{later as}} {{an elderly man}} {{near the end of}} his life, Marques de Sousa would fondly recall his advancement: [...] "Never in my life had I judged myself so great, nor {{experienced}} such ineffable rejoicing... as in the day I placed my fists into the cuffs of alferes. I walked through all the streets of the city, looking at myself, <b>conceited,</b> believing that everyone looking with admiration envied my luck, that all enamored ladies vied for my hand." [...] For the remainder of the conflict he was stationed in the defense of Montevideo. The conquest of the Banda Oriental was ended in July 1821, when Portugal declared it a province of Brazil with the name of Cisplatina.|$|E
500|$|Kurosawa quickly {{moved on}} to his next project, Red Beard. Based on a short story {{collection}} by Shūgorō Yamamoto and incorporating elements from Dostoyevsky's novel The Insulted and Injured, it is a period film, set in a mid-nineteenth century clinic for the poor, in which Kurosawa's humanist themes receive perhaps their fullest statement. A <b>conceited</b> and materialistic, foreign-trained young doctor, Yasumoto, is forced to become an intern at the clinic under the stern tutelage of Doctor Niide, known as [...] "Akahige" [...] ("Red Beard"), played by Mifune. Although he resists Red Beard initially, Yasumoto comes to admire his wisdom and courage, and to perceive the patients at the clinic, whom he at first despised, as worthy of compassion and dignity.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his enthusiasm}} for propaganda, Van der Byl was outraged when the BBC {{subsequently}} set up a radio station at Francistown in Botswana which broadcast for 27 months, criticising UDI and urging Rhodesians to revoke it. He was later to claim the station was inciting violence, although this was denied by some who had been regular listeners. On 26 January 1966, {{two months after the}} UDI, Van der Byl was willing to be quoted as saying that Rhodesian Army troops would follow a [...] "scorched earth" [...] policy should the United Kingdom send in troops, comparing their position to that of the Red Army when Nazi forces invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. He was highly critical of Harold Wilson, describing him as a [...] "highly dangerous, uninformed and <b>conceited</b> little man." ...|$|E
500|$|As the {{campaign}} progressed, fears grew among Hamilton {{and his supporters}} that Adams was too vain, opinionated, unpredictable and stubborn to follow their directions once elected. Desiring [...] "a more pliant president than Adams," [...] Hamilton maneuvered to tip the election to Pinckney. He coerced South Carolina Federalist electors, pledged to vote for [...] "favorite son" [...] Pinckney, to scatter their second votes among candidates other than Adams. Hamilton's scheme was undone, however, when several New England state electors heard of it, conferred, and agreed not to vote for Pinckney. Adams was nonetheless angered, writing shortly after the election that Hamilton was a [...] "proud Spirited, <b>conceited,</b> aspiring Mortal always pretending to Morality, with as debauched Morals as old Franklin who is more his Model than any one I know." ...|$|E
500|$|The two writers had {{different}} temperaments: Shōnagon was witty, clever, and outspoken; Murasaki was withdrawn and sensitive. Entries in Murasaki's diary {{show that the}} two {{may not have been}} on good terms. Murasaki wrote, [...] "Sei Shōnagon... was dreadfully <b>conceited.</b> She thought herself so clever, littered her writing with Chinese characters, [...] left a great deal to be desired." [...] Keene thinks that Murasaki's impression of Shōnagon could have been influenced by Shōshi and the women at her court because Shōnagon served Shōshi's rival empress. Furthermore, he believes Murasaki was brought to court to write Genji in response to Shōnagon's popular Pillow Book. Murasaki contrasted herself to Shōnagon in a variety of ways. She denigrated the pillow book genre and, unlike Shōnagon who flaunted her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki pretended to not know the language.|$|E
500|$|Charles Jennens {{was born}} around 1700, into a prosperous landowning family whose lands and {{properties}} in Warwickshire and Leicestershire he eventually inherited. His {{religious and political}} views—he opposed the Act of Settlement of 1701 which secured the accession to the British throne for the House of Hanover—prevented him from receiving his degree from Balliol College, Oxford, or from pursuing any form of public career. His family's wealth enabled him {{to live a life}} of leisure while devoting himself to his literary and musical interests. Although the musicologist Watkins Shaw dismisses Jennens as [...] "a <b>conceited</b> figure of no special ability", Donald Burrows has written: [...] "of Jennens's musical literacy there can be no doubt". He was certainly devoted to Handel's music, having helped to finance the publication of every Handel score since Rodelinda in 1725. By 1741, after their collaboration on Saul, a warm friendship had developed between the two, and Handel was a frequent visitor to the Jennens family estate at Gopsall.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the film}} {{received}} more critical reviews. The A.V. Club graded it a B− {{and stated that}} U2's performance was less thrilling than the 3D effects. Online magazine FilmSlash criticized The New York Times statement about U2 3D being the first IMAX art film, stating {{that some of the}} first IMAX titles were [...] "experimental works of art". Music critic Joel Selvin wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle that seeing U2 on the big screen was [...] "more distracting than illuminating", and Time Out London criticized Bono's political statements, stating he [...] "should refrain from ramming his preachy political meanderings down our throats and let the music do the talking". The Daily Telegraph favored Rattle and Hum over U2 3D and called U2's performance [...] "unexciting", criticizing how [...] "the cameras, not the band, are doing all the work". The Guardian, which gave a rating of one out of five stars, claimed that U2 appeared to be [...] "four <b>conceited</b> billionaires who are further up themselves than ever".|$|E
500|$|The {{broadcast}} of the first episode brought positive comments for Irving and Meyer from television critics. Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail described Meyer as the series' [...] "only distinctive character", while Peter Paterson, also of the Daily Mail, deemed Meyer a welcome change to the caring, politically correct and compassionate characters seen in Casualty. In the Birmingham Post, Graham Keal called Irving's portrayal [...] "a charismatic combination of autocratic arrogance and dry wit", and noted that the character's interactions with Nick Jordan [...] "form the programme's primary double act". Andrew Billen in the New Statesman called Meyer the most compelling character of the series, while Kathleen Morgan of the Daily Record similarly deemed Meyer {{the star of the}} show, writing that Irving: [...] "gave a chilling performance as a man who saves lives simply to boost his ego."

500|$|A {{few weeks}} after getting the title, Nitro's ring name was changed to [...] "John Morrison" [...] and his gimmick was tweaked {{to be even more}} <b>conceited</b> and self–aggrandizing — in {{addition}} to being modeled after Jim Morrison (1943–1971), the legendary frontman of the 1960s rock band The Doors, to whom Nitro bears a strong physical resemblance. After defeating CM Punk again at The Great American Bash, he began taking part in a [...] "15 Minutes of Fame" [...] segment on the weekly ECW on Sci Fi television program, where if a wrestler could either defeat him or last 15 minutes without being defeated, they would earn a title shot. The first wrestler to do so was CM Punk, which set up another match between the two at SummerSlam. Morrison won by illegally using the ring ropes for leverage. The next week, Punk again became the number one contender; this time, however, Punk won the championship. Morrison was then suspended for thirty days for violating WWE's Wellness Program, renewing his feud with Punk upon his return, as well as competing against The Miz for the number one contendership to the title.|$|E

She loses her sense of taste out of sorrow, although she quickly recovers it. After Sora's death, Daichi is unable to bring himself to act on his love for her, though he gives in to his father's demands to protect Najika from being kicked out of the school and becomes the student body president to replace Sora.

After Clarke finished questioning Williams, Asquith cross-examined the soldier {{for the remainder of the}} session; after a brief re-examination by Clarke, the day—and the case for the plaintiff—came to an end. The third day began with the opening speech for the defendants, after which Stanley Wilson took the stand for the remainder of the day, and on into the fourth day. Examined by Asquith, Stanley recounted seeing Gordon-Cumming illicitly add counters to his stake twice on the first night and at least twice on the second night, although he could not remember the full details. When cross-examined by Clarke he was not brow-beaten by the lawyer's questions, although Clarke made him appear [...] "brash, <b>conceited</b> and callow". Stanley was replaced in the witness box by Levett; The Morning Advertiser considered that Levett [...] "felt somewhat uncomfortable" [...] appearing against Gordon-Cumming, and reported that he had [...] "described his position as an 'awkward' one". Despite his discomfort, Levett confirmed that on the first evening he had seen Gordon-Cumming add counters after the hand had finished but before the stake had been paid. He was unsure of other details of the evening's play, and had not witnessed anything on the second night.|$|E
