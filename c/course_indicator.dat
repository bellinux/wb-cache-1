50|$|The Battenberg <b>course</b> <b>indicator</b> is a {{mechanical}} calculating device invented by Prince Louis of Battenberg in 1892 for taking station on other vessels whose range & bearing and course & speed are known. By extension, {{it has a}} range of other functions related to relative velocity calculations. A number of versions of the device were produced and it proved particularly useful for station-keeping, such as ships moving in convoy during World War II. Manufacture of the instruments was contracted to Elliott Brothers, London. Devices based on the Battenberg indicator were also developed for determining course and distance in aviation and when making allowances for aircraft drift due to winds. Instruments were also manufactured for other navies, for example in the USA.|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates students’ {{assessment}} of on-line vs face-to-face delivery of lecture-based information technology courses. The study used end-of-course surveys to examine students’ ratings of five course quality indicators: Course Organization, Assessment and Grading Procedures, Instructor Performance, Positive Learning Experience, and Perceived Success. The study analyzed five semesters of students’ ratings {{and found no}} significant differences in the overall ratings of the <b>course</b> quality <b>indicators</b> between the on-line and face-to-face courses. There were differences between the overall ratings of the <b>course</b> quality <b>indicators,</b> with instructor performance and course organization receiving the highest ratings. More importantly, there was a significant interaction between the <b>course</b> quality <b>indicators</b> and the <b>course</b> structure. Examination of this interaction indicated that the course organization, the assessment and grading procedures, and the students’ perceived success in the course, were higher in on-line courses, while instructor performance was better in face-to-face courses. These findings suggest different ways to improve both the on-line and face-to-face courses. Finally, the most surprising outcome was that students perceived greater success in on-line courses. However, this result needs further exploration in future studies...|$|R

Most of the BTR-50PUs have two {{projecting}} bays {{on the front of}} the vehicle (the respective NATO codes are: BTR-50PU(1) and BTR-50PU(2)). The two bays are the same shape, unlike in the OT-62 TOPAS, which is otherwise very similar in appearance. The vehicle has ten seats, of which four are for the commander and his staff, four are for the radio operators and two are for the vehicle's commander and driver. The staff compartment has a collapsible table, a second small table for the commander, two hammocks and three ladders. An emergency escape hatch is provided in the floor of the vehicle and the vehicle has thermal insulation. Specialized equipment consists of KN-2 and KP-2 navigation devices; an AB-1-P/30 1 kW generator (located on the rear engine deck); R-105, R-105U and R-113 VHF radios; a R-112 HF transceiver, a R-311 HF receiver; a collapsible 11 m mast antenna for the R-105U; a light 10 m telescopic mast for the R-112; a R-403BM relay-set; R-120 intercom and a P-193A 10-line field telephone switchboard with six TAI-43 field telephones and four cable reels, each with 600 m of two-wire cable. The navigation system includes a gyro <b>course</b> <b>indicator</b> and course plotter (the former indicates the vehicle's course, the latter plots it on a rectangular co-ordinate system). Some vehicles have different numbers of stowage boxes in different arrangements on the rear engine decks. Some vehicles have a second generator.|$|E

40|$|Objective:  To {{examine the}} {{prognostic}} value of personality dimensions and {{negative and positive}} life events for diagnostic and symptom course trajectories in depressive and anxiety disorder. Method:  A total of 1209 subjects (18 – 65 years) with depressive and/or anxiety disorder were recruited in primary and specialized mental health care. Personality dimensions at baseline were assessed with the NEO-FFI and incidence and date of life events retrospectively with a structured interview at 2 -year follow-up. DSM-IV-based diagnostic interviews as well as life chart assessments allowed course assessment at both the diagnostic and symptom trajectory level over 2 years. Results:  Life events {{were significantly related to}} diagnostic and symptom course trajectories of depression and anxiety also after correcting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Only negative life events prospectively predicted longer time to remission of depressive disorder. Prospective associations of neuroticism and extraversion with prognosis of anxiety and depression were greatly reduced after correcting for baseline severity and duration of index disorder. Personality traits did not moderate the effect of life events on 2 -year <b>course</b> <b>indicators.</b> Conclusions:  Negative life events have an independent effect on diagnostic and symptom course trajectories of depression {{and to a lesser extent}} anxiety unconfounded by sociodemographic, clinical, and personality characteristics...|$|R
