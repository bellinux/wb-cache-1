Framing these results within Garland’s depiction of the criminology of the self and the criminology of the other, it is evident that in reality, the punitive strategy prevails. This strategy explains the rare <b>use</b> of <b>compassionate</b> release and how it negatively impacts prisoners’ access to end-of-life care. A possible solution is the welfarist criminology, strongly supported by a human rights approach. Awareness of the dominance of the punitive strategy is crucial for medical personnel as they are best placed to ensure access to end-of-life care for prisoners through compassionate release...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} nurses to reflect or {{critically}} examine {{the impact of}} professional standards of practice, legal guidelines, and ethical frameworks that influence and guide their practice is essential to help patients achieve quality of life and wellness. Regardless of the location and setting where nursing takes place, contextual factors such as the benefits and potential harm resulting from the care provided, availability of resources, the nurse’s scope of practice, and evidence-based practice guidelines, all affect a nurse’s ability to practice in a safe, ethical, competent, caring, and <b>compassionate</b> manner. <b>Using</b> an exploratory case study to investigate nurses’ (n= 9) view of their practice during a 15 -day mission in Nepal, semi-structured interviews, perusal of documents, archival records, physical artifacts, and observation contributed to understanding the experience of nursing in the mission. A modified version of constant comparative analysis was employed to examine, code, and triangulate data into themes. Benner’s (2001) novice-to-expert levels of proficiency and an ethics of care provided the conceptual frameworks to support and facilitate the research through an Interpretivist lens. A strength-base care approach to nursing practice and the examination of the critical role of effective and ethical mission leadership also assisted to understand nursing practice in the mission. The findings demonstrate the impact of individual, group, and situational factors on the participants’ ability to nurse during the mission and practice in a safe, ethical, competent, caring, and compassionate manner.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThere {{are scarce}} data {{available}} on transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR), and these have been limited to procedural results, with no follow-up status reported. ObjectivesThe {{goal of this}} study was to evaluate the feasibility, procedural results, and 6 -month follow-up outcomes after TMVR with a mitral transcatheter heart valve (Fortis, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, California). MethodsWe report a series of 3 patients (mean age 71 ± 9 years, 2 men) who had TMVR under a <b>compassionate</b> clinical <b>use</b> program. All patients treated had functional mitral regurgitation (MR) secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy (prior bypass surgery in all cases; left ventricular ejection fraction between 25 % and 30 %) and were considered to be at very high surgical risk (mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score: 9. 3). ResultsThe procedure was performed through the transapical approach, and the valve was successfully implanted in all cases, with no major complications. At hospital discharge, echocardiographic evaluation revealed trace residual MR in 2 patients and no MR in 1 patient. The mean transvalvular mitral gradient was ≤ 4 mm Hg in all patients. At the 3 -month follow-up, the valve function remained unchanged, and transesophageal echocardiography and computed tomography showed no structural failures. All patients had improvements in functional status, in exercise capacity as evaluated by 6 -min walk test, and in quality of life. At 6 -month follow-up, all patients remain alive, without hospital readmission for heart failure and with New York Heart Association functional class ≤II. ConclusionsTMVR with this valve is feasible and is associated with good outcomes. Optimal valve functional results were obtained acutely and were sustained at 6 -month follow-up in all patients. Further studies with a larger number of patients and longer follow-up are warranted...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the benefits of}} a group-based compassion-focused therapy approach in a heterogeneous group of clients presenting with severe and enduring mental health difficulties to a community mental health team. Seven groups with an average of five clients per group were run over 12 – 14 weeks. The format of the group followed the procedures of explaining the evolutionary model, formulating client problems within the compassion-focused therapy model, introducing clients to the core practices of <b>compassionate</b> training, and <b>using</b> compassion based interventions to address core difficulties. Questionnaires were completed pre- and post intervention: Self-criticism, shame, depression, anxiety, and stress. Significant reductions were found for depression, anxiety, stress, self-criticism, shame, submissive behavior, and social comparison post intervention. Of importance, at pre-intervention the majority of patients were in the severe category of depression scores. At the end of therapy the majority were in the borderline category. A combination of self-report data and client feedback suggests that compassion focused therapy is easily understood, well-tolerated, seen as helpful and produces significant changes in objective measures of mental health difficulties in naturalistic settings.

40|$|In {{two lines}} of work, I explore the effects of <b>using</b> <b>compassionate</b> language.

The second line of work asks whether self-distancing promotes self-compassion.

6000|$|But Milton {{drew the}} line of liberty at what he calls 'neighbouring differences, or rather indifferences.' The Arminian {{controversy}} had loosened the bonds with which the newly liberated churches of the Reformation, had made haste to bind themselves again, and weakened that authority of confessions, which had replaced the older but not more intolerant authority of the universal church. Other controversies which raged {{during the first half}} of the seventeenth century,--those between catholics and protestants, between prelatists and presbyterians, between socinians and trinitarians, between latitudinarians, puritans, and sacramentalists,--all tended to weaken theological exclusiveness. This slackening, however, was no more than partial. Roger Williams, indeed, the Welsh founder of Rhode Island, preached, as early as 1631, the principles of an unlimited toleration, extending to catholics, Jews, and even infidels. Milton stopped a long way short of this.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to present and {{understand}} therapists’ experiences of the impact of their mindfulness meditation practice on their role in the therapeutic alliance. The topic emerged in response to extant research recommendations and researcher observations of the compatibility between mindfulness meditation outcomes and the demands on therapists for establishing effective alliances with clients. The study adopted an interpretive phenomenological analysis strategy located within the qualitative paradigm, and thus a small sample of therapists practicing mindfulness meditation were selected and interviewed on their experiences using semi-structured interviewing. Data were analysed for meaning units, which were then interpreted inductively and hermeneutically and categorized into superordinate themes. Three superordinate themes within participants’ experiences of how their mindfulness meditation practice impacts upon their role in the alliance were determined, namely: ‘self-care’; ‘insight into the structure of selfhood’; and ‘immediate mindfulness meditation during therapy’. This study found these experiences capacitated participants with <b>compassionate</b> interpersonal affects <b>used</b> for creating secure bonds with clients; skills for accurate empathic understanding; and skills and attitudes for working collaboratively with clients. Should future research confirm these findings, mindfulness meditation may be used as a tool to developed alliance formation abilities for therapists in training.

A systematic {{review of the}} existing literature on compassion and compassion-based interventions identified the primarily focused of research has been on symptom outcome measures utilizing quantitative approaches. No study that explored the experiences and processes of developing self-compassion was identified. The aims and epistemological stance of the researcher led to a qualitative methodology being used. Once ethical approval was gained, six participants were recruited from two CMT programmes, being run by the same facilitators. All service-users who completed the programme reported a development of self-compassion. Participants were interviewed face-to-face using a semi-structured interview schedule. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was selected to analyse the transcribed data. The {{analysis of the data}} identified four super-ordinate themes: essential components of self-compassion; process of self-compassion development over time; group experiences; and negotiating change. The first two themes focused on the development and experience of self-compassion. The second two themes included the experience of developing self-compassion in a group and the general change process. Each theme is discussed and presented with supporting quotes. The study found that service-users are able to develop components of self-compassion using CMT. However, continued practice of compassionate behaviours needs to follow the end of the programme for self-compassion to become habitual. The study also identified a number of group factors and processes that prevented or promoted therapeutic change. The results are discussed with reference to the current literature on self-compassion, compassion-based interventions, group processes, mechanisms of change, and further investigation. A model of self-compassion development is proposed. Finally, the researcher's critical reflections of the research process are presented...|$|R
