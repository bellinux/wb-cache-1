25|$|Tom Laliberty of Raytheon {{said that}} President Barack Obama {{was forced to}} shift from a land based missile defense system to a sea based one because of the {{difficulties}} of coordinating with partner nations. There is discussion {{about the effectiveness of}} this plan. Some <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is not as effective as a ground-based defense since the most advanced Standard missiles lack even half the range to hit ICBMs and even IRBMs arcing overhead. Also, the U.S. Defense Department has said it would be just one component of a wider defense which might also include ground-based facilities. There are some reports that SPY-1 radar systems onboard some individual warships are not being maintained properly.|$|E

However, in 1966 several {{fragments}} of the papyri were found in the archives of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and in the LDS Church archives. They are now referred to as the Joseph Smith Papyri. Upon examination by professional Mormon and non-Mormon Egyptologists, these fragments were identified as Egyptian funerary texts, including the [...] "Breathing Permit of Hôr" [...] and the [...] "Book of the Dead", among others. As a result, the Book of Abraham has been the source of significant controversy. <b>Critics</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is a work of fiction created by Smith, while some Mormon apologists defend its authenticity.|$|E

Weaver said it was [...] "urban and urbane," [...] and GSA Administrator Lawson B. Knott, Jr., praised it as [...] "a lasting architectural asset to our capital city and our country".

[...] In 1998, The Washington Post architectural critic called the building [...] "impressive...a brooding, strangely graceful concrete honeycomb." [...] Architecture critic Carole Rifkind called it [...] "compelling by virtue of the swaggering efficiency of the construction system." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{documentary}} evidence {{is the cornerstone}} in the stories of Polina Zherebtsova.
