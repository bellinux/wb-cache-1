50|$|They are chroma and luminance, <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> {{is where}} one see color {{fluctuations}} and luminance is where one see light/dark fluctuations. Generally, the luminance noise {{looks more like}} film grain while <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> looks more unnatural or digital like.|$|E
5000|$|In {{real-world}} photographs, {{the highest}} spatial-frequency detail consists mostly of variations in brightness ("luminance detail") rather than variations in hue ("chroma detail"). Since any noise reduction algorithm {{should attempt to}} remove noise without sacrificing real detail from the scene photographed, one risks a greater loss of detail from luminance noise reduction than <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> reduction simply because most scenes have little high frequency chroma detail to begin with. In addition, most people find <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> in images more objectionable than luminance noise; the colored blobs are considered [...] "digital-looking" [...] and unnatural, compared to the grainy appearance of luminance noise that some compare to film grain. For these two reasons, most photographic noise reduction algorithms split the image detail into chroma and luminance components and apply more noise reduction to the former.|$|E
50|$|This {{decision}} can be {{assisted by}} knowing {{the characteristics of}} the source image and of human vision. Most noise reduction algorithms perform much more aggressive <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> reduction, since there is little important fine chroma detail that one risks losing. Furthermore, many people find luminance noise less objectionable to the eye, since its textured appearance mimics the appearance of film grain.|$|E
50|$|Most {{dedicated}} noise-reduction {{computer software}} allows {{the user to}} control <b>chroma</b> and luminance <b>noise</b> reduction separately.|$|R
5000|$|Copying {{video from}} one VCR to another VCR {{displayed}} compromised playback reliability, and exponential levels of head-switching <b>noise,</b> <b>chroma</b> smearing and <b>noise,</b> compounded with every generation. These technical challenges motivated videotape editors and engineers to plan work around minimising generational degradation. Use of a time-base corrector (TBC) or [...] "dub" [...] cable were methods of minimising multi-generational quality loss. The TBC regenerates the sync tip {{portion of the}} video signal, improving playback reliability. The dub, demodulated (or [...] "demod") cable was a multi-conductor cable that circumvented a portion of video circuitry, minimising amplification noise.|$|R
3000|$|Dfine is {{made for}} both amateurs and experts. The {{automatic}} process consists of two steps: to measure the noise and to remove the noise. The application allows the full control of the noise reduction process, too. The entity of the noise can be measured manually depending on {{the features of the}} image under processing, by selecting a region of the image affected by noise and then by filtering only a specific color range or a specific object. The default noise reduction method is named [...] "Control Points" [...] and it allows the user to select different parts of the image and to tune the filter strength. The statistics collected on the selected data are used to perform the noise reduction on the whole image. The Control Points method allows the user also to manage separately the <b>chroma</b> and contrast <b>noise.</b> Moreover, the so-built noise profile can be saved and applied for further executions. The [...] "Color Range" [...] method is designed to preserve specific colors. It is also possible to apply the algorithm only to specific objects, for example, on the skin, or processing the background of the image only.|$|R
50|$|The Foveon X3 sensor, {{as used in}} the Sigma SD10 camera, {{has been}} {{characterized}} by two independent reviewers as noisier than the sensors in some other DSLRs using the Bayer sensor at higher ISO film speed equivalents,and specifically <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> has been noted.Another has noted higher noise during long exposure times.However, these reviewers offer no opinion as to whether this is an inherent property of the sensor or the camera's image processing algorithms.|$|E
50|$|In 1896, {{a trading}} post named Spitzkopje was built below the {{mountain}} by the German Colonial Society, the centrepiece of a 120,000-hectare farm. The Society built a five-room farmhouse and stables, storerooms and other outbuildings. In 1899 the farm held 120 horses, 1,500 cattle and 4,000 sheep and goats; its manager was a German settler named Carl Schlettwein.Later it {{was transferred to}} the Farmer Jooste and a police station was built (the foundation walls are still under Pontok 4 <b>chroma</b> <b>noise).</b>|$|E
5000|$|JVC would counter 1985's SuperBeta with VHS HQ, or High Quality. The {{frequency}} modulation of the VHS luminance signal {{is limited to}} 3 megahertz, which makes higher resolutions technically impossible even with the highest-quality recording heads and tape materials, but an HQ branded deck includes luminance noise reduction, <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> reduction, white clip extension, and improved sharpness circuitry. The effect was to increase the apparent horizontal resolution of a VHS recording from 240 to 250 analog (equivalent to 333 pixels from left-to-right, in digital terminology). The major VHS OEMs resisted HQ due to cost concerns, eventually resulting in JVC reducing the requirements for the HQ brand to [...] "white clip extension plus one other improvement." ...|$|E
40|$|Chroma is a two-part, sound {{installation}} for six cassette players. The piece both builds upon {{approaches to}} the sculpting and framing of ‘surplus’ noise evidenced in liminal’s (Frances Crow and David Prior) Organ of Corti, but here, the focus moves from the acoustic mediation of environmental sound to {{an examination of the}} role of noise in recording media. The installation was made for the Paul Stolper Gallery, London. Contributing to the recent upsurge in both scholarship and practice on the theme of <b>noise,</b> <b>Chroma</b> juxtaposes the two meanings of the term – as unwanted sound and as a sound that has no discernable pitch – in dialogue with each other. Part one of the piece plays six ostensibly 'static' noise colours through six tape players. While these recordings interact with each other within the acoustics of the gallery, they are also interacting with the technology that carries them: the cassette tape and the 6 -watt speaker. In this way, Chroma: Interactions of Noise, uses these coloured noises both as the fabric from which to sculpt the gallery space and as the material from which to make a homage to the medium of tape itself. Part two of the installation, Other Places, contrasts the focus on interactions in space with a focus on temporal evolution. Originally commissioned by Lunapark Ensemble (NL) for a concert listening environment, Other Places evolves as a musical work, using field recordings of noise: air conditioning, wind, and in particular the noise of slide and 8 mm projector fans, as the basis for an immersive tableaux of sculpted noise...|$|R
30|$|In {{literature}} {{there are}} several techniques for <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> reduction. Some of them make use of optical filters installed in the digital cameras to avoid aliasing [1 – 3].

It is a modular application for <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> reduction based on two principal algorithms: the SGBNR (Selective Gaussian Blur Noise Reduction) and the SCNR (Subtractive Chromatic Noise Reduction). The first one is an efficient method to reduce the noise in the medium and large-dimensional scales, while the second one is a technique developed to remove noise in the green channel of coloured deep-sky astrophotos.|$|E

30|$|But a fair {{comparison}} {{among the}} algorithms {{must take into}} account their complexity and the specific application they have been developed to. The DCT-CNR is fully automatic and it has been developed to be implemented as additional feature of a JPEG encoder with negligible additional hardware and computational resources. The main constraint driving the algorithm design was to reduce the computational and memory costs. Most of the <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> reduction algorithms, Dfine and CB included, have been developed for postprocessing. Their application into an IGP implies adding to the chain a block dedicated to <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> reduction, with consequently increase of resources requirement.|$|E
30|$|<b>Chroma</b> <b>noise</b> is {{a serious}} problem in color imaging under low light conditions. A.

The contribution of the DCT coefficients having highest probability to be corrupted by noise is reduced while preserving the image regions containing edges. The algorithm has been designed as an additional feature of a JPEG encoder with negligible hardware and computational resources. In L. Huang et al.'s paper, a new nonconvex variational model for multiplicative noise removal is proposed under MAP framework. They prove the existence and uniqueness of a minimizer for the new model and develop an associated iterative algorithm.|$|E
30|$|All the {{algorithms}} {{discussed above}} require {{interaction with the}} user. This paper presents the DCT-CNR (Discrete Cosine Transform-Chroma Noise Reduction), an efficient <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> reduction algorithm based on soft-thresholding on DCT data and designed to be integrated in the Image Generation Pipeline (IGP) [20], which allows any image system to yield the final color image starting from sensor data. Each step of the chain affects the noise level in the image; so reducing the noise during the generation process is a crucial step to improve the output quality. The DCT-CNR allows to limit <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> locally without using interaction {{and it can be}} easily embedded in JPEG encoders, which usually is the final step of the IGP, with negligible computational overload.|$|E

3000|$|The main {{drawback}} of the SCNR {{is that it}} {{can introduce}} a magenta cast to the sky background, which must be controlled by a careful dosage of the Amount parameter. PixInsight contains also the [...] "ATrousWaveletTransform", a rich tool able to reduce the high-frequencies <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> using the wavelet decomposition. It exploits median and erosion/dilation morphological filters for specific noise reduction tasks, such as impulsive noise removal.|$|E
30|$|The {{panorama}} of consumer solutions available as plug-in or as standalone application includes also Noise Ninja [18] and Dfine [19]. Noise Ninja {{is a powerful}} software produced by the PictureCode LLC that removes <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> with an algorithm in the wavelet domain. It is a good trade-off between noise reduction and details preservation.

3000|$|Noise {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} problems in digital images, especially in low-light conditions. The relative amount of [...] "chroma" [...] and [...] "luminance" [...] noise varies depending on the exposure settings and on the camera model. In particular, low-light no-flash photography suffers from severe noise problems. A complete elimination of luminance noise can be unnatural and the full <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> removal can introduce false colors; so the denoising algorithms should vary properly the filtering strength, depending on the input local characteristics.|$|E
30|$|The crucial {{step of the}} {{algorithm}} is the coring threshold definition. It should be big enough to reduce the noise and small enough to preserve the details. Moreover, it should be different for each block {{to take into account}} the information content, avoiding texture or detailed regions destruction and performing a strong noise reduction in the flat areas, where the <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> is more visible. A fixed threshold definition may not be a good solution because it could not manage differently the details in regions with different features.|$|E
30|$|Any image device {{contains}} an IGP [20], which transforms the sensor {{data in the}} final RGB image. Each step of the pipeline affects the output noise level, which depends on many factors, including sensor type, pixel dimensions, temperature, exposure time, and ISO speed. An effective noise reduction strategy should be distributed (limiting the noise introduction or amplification in each block of the chain). The DCT-CNR has been developed to be easily integrated into the JPEG encoder, which is placed {{at the end of}} the pipeline to perform the compression, providing <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> reduction without resources overload.|$|E
30|$|A {{simple and}} {{efficient}} algorithm for <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> reduction, called DCT-CNR, has been presented. It operates in the DCT data domain, managing the chromatic components only. The DCT-CNR {{has a very}} low complexity in terms of computational costs and it also requires few hardware resources because it could be easily integrated in the JPEG compression block of an IGP of a digital still camera improving the final image quality without additional complexity. It {{is based on a}} DCT block classification and it is able to preserve the zones of the image containing details or edges by applying a stronger filtering on the flat regions.|$|E
40|$|Non-linear filter {{responses}} of natural colour images {{have been shown}} to display non-Gaussian heavy tailed distributions which we call sparse. These filters operate in the YUV colour space on the chroma channel U (and V) using weighting functions obtained from the gray image Y. In this paper we utilise this knowledge for denoising the chroma channels of a colour image from inaccurate measurements. In our model the U (and V) elements are affected by noise, with a good version of the gray image Y obtainable through existing methods. We show that accurate reconstruction of the chroma components can be accomplished by solving an L 1 constrained optimisation problem, where the sparse filter response on natural images is used as a regularization term. This scheme gives comparable results to leading commercial and state of the art denoising algorithms, and exceeds for <b>chroma</b> <b>noise</b> that does not correlate with the luminance structure...|$|E
