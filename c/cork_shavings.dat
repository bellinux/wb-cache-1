50|$|Footballs {{have gone}} through a {{dramatic}} change over time. During medieval times balls were normally made from an outer shell of leather filled with <b>cork</b> <b>shavings.</b> Another method of creating a ball was using animal bladders for {{the inside of the}} ball making it inflatable. However, these two styles of creating footballs made it easy for the ball to puncture and were inadequate for kicking. It was not until the 19th century that footballs developed into what a football looks like today.|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, {{a growing}} public {{concern for the}} environment, the {{resources}} depletion and the increasing quantities of waste and energy, is forcing manufacturers to recycle or reuse materials. Recycled by-products, such as tyre <b>shavings,</b> wood tailings, <b>cork,</b> clothes and natural wool waste, may be formed into building materials that have desirable acoustic and physical properties. These materials are novel and can provide alternatives to traditional products {{in a number of}} environmental noise control applications. In the present work, their promising use as resilient layer in floating floor systems is evaluated using different techniques, such as dynamic stiffness and thermogravimetric tests. In particular, {{one of the most important}} aspects taken into account is the effect of their nonhomogeneous nature on the final performance. Considering resilient layers made of recycled textile fibres, <b>cork</b> and tyre <b>shavings,</b> the measured properties may significantly vary with manufacturer or production method...|$|R
