40|$|The marked {{increase}} of IP-based services {{has resulted in}} the need for a more flexible rating process than the present 'flat-rate' accounting approach. This paper presents the design and development of a Rating Bureau Service for the IP telecommunications environment. It illustrates the architecture, information model, technologies, and standards used in development of the system, as well as expounding upon some of the key implementation goals. In the proposed rating environment, flexibility is achieved by decoupling the charging algorithm and the core rating system. Hence, algorithms can be changed independently of the core system, avoiding the need to recode and recompile. Algorithms can be swapped {{in and out of the}} system during rating, allowing a potentially limitless range of services to be rated by equal numbers of tailored algorithms. All algorithms in the system are spreadsheet-based. This approach moves the modelling and construction of algorithms from the programming domain into the business design arena. Anyone with a working knowledge of spreadsheets can effortlessly construct/update these arbitrarily complex charging algorithms.

40|$|Abstract — The {{measurement}} of call quality from end users perspective is emerging {{area of research}} on speech quality in telecommunication networks. The research is focussed on deriving the call quality parameters from end-users perspective and visualize, escalate the critical call quality. Also proses the method of redemption of call charges based on call quality parameters perceived. The research proposed and developed measures certain call parameters during the call and provide average scores {{at the end of}} the call. Call quality for the bundle of calls is derived based on the aggregation of successful call parameters which gives the overall call quality measure. The call parameters used in our research were Signal Strength, the successful call rate, normal drop call rate, handover drop rate. GPS coordinates are also used to locate the location and quality of the individual calls. The methodology of extracting the parameters used is basically the signal strength and number of successful and un-successful calls in a bundle of 10 calls. At the end of 10 th call the average parameter value has been computed for each of the parameter mentioned that are used for deriving the final call quality. A model using the sms feature for tackling the critical quality and escalation has been proposed and developed as a part of the system. The results of the call quality correlation with the subjective scores are also presented. Various <b>call</b> <b>charging</b> methods based on call quality perceived by the enduser are proposed, which satisfies the subscribers and helps the operators to reduce the churn and increase the ARPU. Finally, the simulation results of the proposed and developed system are presented...|$|E
40|$|Fraud {{activities}} have reached to critical point causing millions of ringgit of losses to telecommunication companies, {{and as a}} result, forcing them to employ applications or systems (such as Telekom Malaysia Berhad’s Next Generation Fraud Detection System) to detect the said activities. We introduce a new algorithm that could detect fraud activities in telecommunication industry (e. g. intrusion fraud which occurs when legitimate account is comprised by an intruder who makes or sells calls on this account) that uses Gaussian Mixed Model (or GMM), a probabilistic model normally used in fraud detection via speech recognition. Due {{to the complexity of}} GMM, we use Expectation Maximization (or EM) algorithm by Dempster et al. (1977) to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the GMM parameters. Together with Kernel method (see Silverman, 1986), we improve the process of finding the number of components in GMM. In addition, we have also successfully derived the likelihood ratio test in the determination of the number of components in GMM and the comparison of its results with those of Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) will also be highlighted in this thesis. The said algorithm uses similarity coefficient to classify the real data based on the log-likelihood function and it’s extended to detect incoming fraud calls as suspected by the telecommunication company. The new algorithm is tested on simulated and real data where the results show it is capable of detecting fraud activities. The real data, which included <b>call</b> <b>charging</b> and duration, are collected from Telekom Malaysia Berhad’s exchanges and they are believed to be contaminated by fraud activities. As the original data are clearly not in the format that is generally used for speech recognition, they are reformatted prior to testing and analysis. The new algorithm is in agreement with those suspected by the company...|$|E

The Task The evaluation task is calculating the cost of a telephone call, using different versions of a prototype application. Each user is required to use all the different versions. Most people are familiar with telephone usage so that the task domain should not be unfamiliar to any user. However the method of <b>call</b> <b>charging</b> employed by BT is not particularly obvious, and so many people will not be familiar with exactly how telephone charges are calculated. BT charge calls by measuring the number of units used in each call. Each unit costs 5. 06 pence. Some calls are more expensive than others, due to the distance called, or the amount of equipment used. For example overseas calls are typically much more expensive than inland calls and calls to mobile phones are particularly expensive. BT cope with this by allotting different amounts of time per unit to each distance band, hence a Local call may use one unit every 360 seconds, and a call to Hong Kong may use a unit every 3. 5 seconds. Additionally BT vary the amount of time per unit according to the time of day, so that busy periods are more expensive. Inland calls usually have three charge rates, cheap, standard and peak, however some overseas calls have only one charge rate, and many have just two. British Telecom, (1987). In this study the functional part of each version of the prototype is clearly separated from the interface. There is considerable scope for variation in the way a user enters call parameters (distance and time of day). Also the way a user calls the different application functions provides considerable scope for interf [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Call {{quality has}} been crucial from the {{inception}} of telecommunication networks. Operators need to monitor call quality from the end-user¿s perspective, in order to retain subscribers and reduce subscriber ¿churn¿. Operators worry not only about call quality and interconnect revenue loss, but also about network connectivity issues in areas where mobile network gateways are prevalent. Bandwidth quality as experienced by the end-user is equally important in helping operators to reduce churn. The parameters that network operators use to improve call quality are mainly from the end-user¿s perspective. These parameters are usually ASR (answer seizure ratio), PDD (postdial delay), NER (network efficiency ratio), the number of calls for which these parameters have been analyzed and successful calls. Operators use these parameters to evaluate and optimize the network to meet their quality requirements. Analysis of speech quality is a major arena for research. Traditionally, users¿ perception of speech quality has been measured offline using subjective listening tests. Such tests are, however, slow, tedious and costly. An alternative method is therefore needed; {{one that can be}} automatically computed on the subscriber¿s handset, be available to the operator as well as to subscribers and, at the same time, provide results that are comparable with conventional subjective scores. QMeter® ¿ a set of tools for signal and bandwidth measurement that have been developed bearing in mind all the parameters that influence call and bandwidth quality experienced by the end-user ¿ addresses these issues and, additionally, facilitates dynamic tariff propositions which enhance the credibility of the operator. This research focuses on call quality parameters from the end-user¿s perspective. The call parameters used in the research are signal strength, successful call rate, normal drop call rate, and hand-over drop rate. Signal strength is measured for every five milliseconds of an active call and average signal strength is calculated for each successful call. The successful call rate, normal drop rate and hand-over drop rate are used to achieve a measurement of the overall call quality. Call quality with respect to bundles of 10 calls is proposed. An attempt is made to visualize these parameters for better understanding of where the quality is bad, good and excellent. This will help operators, as well as user groups, to measure quality and coverage. Operators boast about their bandwidth but in reality, to know the locations where speed has to be improved, they need a tool that can effectively measure speed from the end-user¿s perspective. BM (bandwidth meter), a tool developed as a part of this research, measures the average speed of data sessions and stores the information for analysis at different locations. To address issues of quality in the subscriber segment, this research proposes the varying of tariffs based on call and bandwidth quality. <b>Call</b> <b>charging</b> based on call quality as perceived by the end-user is proposed, both to satisfy subscribers and help operators to improve customer satisfaction and increase average revenue per user. Tariff redemption procedures are put forward for bundles of 10 calls and 10 data sessions. In addition to the varying of tariffs, quality escalation processes are proposed. Deploying such tools on selected or random samples of users will result in substantial improvement in user loyalty which, in turn, will bring operational and economic advantages...|$|E
