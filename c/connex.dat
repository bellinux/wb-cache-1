However, by February, <b>Connex</b> had changed their mind, {{and no longer}} wanted to purchase the company. Terje Bulling admitted that Timetoget {{had a very good}} agreement for operating the Arendal Line, and that a fourth Y1 railcar had been bought from Sweden for this route. However, when NSB had tried to sell Timetoget, this agreement {{was not part of the}} estate. By April, NSB estimated that they had lost NOK10 million on their engagement in Timetoget. However, they had three Y1 trains, and would be able to start using them on the Bratsberg Line and the Arendal Line.|$|E

5|$|From 1845, {{the line}} was {{operated}} by the SER. In 1899, the SER and LCDR entered into a joint working partnership, the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR). On 1 January 1923, the Railways Act 1921 came into force, resulting in the Grouping. The SECR {{became part of the}} Southern Railway (SR). On 1 January 1948, the Transport Act 1947 came into force, and the SR became part of British Railways, with the former SR lines becoming the Southern Region. British Railways was rebranded British Rail on 1 January 1965. On 10 June 1986, Network SouthEast branded trains began operating. On 1 January 1994, the Railways Act 1993 came into force, privatising British Rail. Passenger services were taken over by <b>Connex</b> South Eastern on 13 October 1996. On 27 June 2003, <b>Connex</b> lost the franchise due to poor financial management. The Strategic Rail Authority took over the running of passenger trains from 9 November 2003, using their South Eastern Trains train operating company. On 1 April 2006, Southeastern took over the operation of passenger trains on the route.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, NSB {{announced}} {{that they wanted to}} discontinue their operations in Narvik, hoping they could leave operation of passenger trains on the Ofot Line to Ofotbanen. In May, NSB signed an agreement with Ofotbanen, where the latter would take over NSB's responsibilities to operate trains from Narvik to Riksgränsen along the Ofot Line. The initial contract would last until 2006, and NSB paid NOK 13 million for the service. From 15 June, Ofotbanen took over all passenger transport on the line, including employing all former NSB employees in Narvik. On the same day, <b>Connex</b> Tåg took over the operations on the Swedish side of the border after winning a public service obligation contract with the Swedish government, and dismissing SJ of the right to offer the service. An operating and security license was granted from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate to Ofotbanen on 11 June.|$|E

On 29 January 2007, <b>Connex</b> cancelled 37 peak-period services until further notice, due to the shortage of operational trains.|$|E

25|$|The two {{companies}} merged in 1899, forming the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR), further amalgamated with other railways by the Railways Act 1921 {{to form the}} Southern Railway.

25|$|The British Rail Class 411 (or 4 Cep) {{electric}} {{multiple units}} were built at Eastleigh works from 1956–63 {{for the newly}} electrified main lines in Kent.

Variants of the class 411 design included the class 410 and class 412 4 Bep units, which contained a buffet car in place of a standard trailer. They were later used on services in Sussex and Hampshire; following the privatisation of British Rail in 1995, the units were used by the <b>Connex</b> South Central, <b>Connex</b> South Eastern and South West Trains franchises.

40|$|Georgette Dal : Morphological productivity: {{definitions}} and related concepts This {{is a state}} of the art article on the question of productivity. It first discusses the various definitions of productivity that have been proposed, and then examines the measures that have been suggested, with special attention to those proposed by Baayen. This survey leads to two results. The first is that the main recent developments do not concern the concept of productivity itself, but rather new measuring procedures which integrate both qualitative and quantitative aspects. The second is {{a significant increase in the}} importance of corpus-based studies in constructional morphology. Complex words are observed in situ in naturally occurring environments. Corpus-based studies allow one to distinguish active and inactive areas in a language, and to avoid confusing central and peripheral types of data. Dal Georgette.
