50|$|The arc {{evaporation}} process {{begins with the}} striking of a high current, low voltage arc {{on the surface of}} a cathode (known as the target) that gives rise to a small (usually a few micrometres wide), highly energetic emitting area known as a <b>cathode</b> <b>spot.</b> The localised temperature at the <b>cathode</b> <b>spot</b> is extremely high (around 15000 °C), which results in a high velocity (10 km/s) jet of vapourised cathode material, leaving a crater behind on the cathode surface. The <b>cathode</b> <b>spot</b> is only active {{for a short period of}} time, then it self-extinguishes and re-ignites in a new area close to the previous crater. This behaviour causes the apparent motion of the arc.|$|E
50|$|One {{downside}} of the arc evaporation process {{is that if}} the <b>cathode</b> <b>spot</b> stays at an evaporative point for too long it can eject a large amount of macro-particles or droplets. These droplets are detrimental to the performance of the coating as they are poorly adhered and can extend through the coating. Worse still if the cathode target material has a low melting point such as aluminium the <b>cathode</b> <b>spot</b> can evaporate through the target resulting in either the target backing plate material being evaporated or cooling water entering the chamber. Therefore, magnetic fields as mentioned previously are used to control the motion of the arc. If cylindrical cathodes are used the cathodes can also be rotated during deposition. By not allowing the <b>cathode</b> <b>spot</b> to remain in one position too long aluminium targets can be used and the number of droplets is reduced. Some companies also use filtered arcs that use magnetic fields to separate the droplets from the coating flux.|$|E
50|$|Since {{momentary}} interruptions or {{reductions of}} output current may cause the <b>cathode</b> <b>spot</b> to extinguish, many rectifiers incorporate an additional electrode {{to maintain an}} arc whenever the plant is in use. Typically, a two or three phase supply of a few amperes passes through small excitation anodes. A magnetically shunted transformer {{of a few hundred}} VA rating is commonly used to provide this supply.|$|E

When using stainless steel and copper as electrode material <b>cathode</b> <b>spots</b> of type I and type II are observed. These <b>cathode</b> <b>spots</b> appear in groups (macrospots) with a diameter of several 100 mu m. Assuming that the lifetime of the macrospots corresponds to the half period time of the current pulse {{the distribution of the}} <b>cathode</b> <b>spots</b> within the macrospots can be explained by a retrograde motion of the spots with a velocity of several 100 m/s in the self-magnetic field of the discharge current. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the <b>cathode</b> <b>spots</b> within the macrospots can be interpreted by assuming a splitting and a repulsion of the <b>cathode</b> <b>spots.</b> The electrode phenomena show that the discharge current is d istributed over a large area which is prerequisite for low erosion and long lifetime operation of the switch...|$|R

50|$|A vacuum arc {{can arise}} when the {{surfaces}} of metal electrodes in contact with a good vacuum begin to emit electrons either through heating (thermionic emission) or via an electric field that is sufficient to cause field electron emission. Once initiated, a vacuum arc can persist since the freed particles gain kinetic energy from the electric field, heating the metal surfaces through high speed particle collisions. This process can create an incandescent <b>cathode</b> <b>spot</b> which frees more particles, thereby sustaining the arc. At sufficiently high currents an incandescent anode spot may also be formed.|$|E

A recent thesis on plasma arcs mentions Priestley's account of a replication of this by the experimenter Benjamin Wilson (1721-1788): In 1759, when Wilson repeated experiments [...] "first contrived by Lord Charles Cavendish," [...] he observed a [...] "singular appearance of light upon one of the surfaces of the quicksilver," [...] (from The History and Present State of Electricity, J Priestly (1775) vol.

The arc exhibited a similar operating regime,to that described in the previous literature for the case of Inconel 718 and zirconium alloy electrodes. The arc behaved in a diffuse mode with many separate and rapidly moving <b>cathode</b> <b>spots.</b> Several parameters of the <b>cathode</b> <b>spots,</b> including their current, size and apparent velocity were evaluated.

A large density ratio of Ti+ ions and Ti atoms in the interelectrode plasma was evaluated, suggesting that the plasma was strongly ionized. The calculated excitation temperature of Ti+ ions (1 - 1. 2 eV) was about 1. 5 - 2 times greater than that obtained for Ti atoms.

The experiments were performed at four values of arc current, nine compositions of the process atmosphere N 2 +C 2 H 2 and three pressure ranges of the process atmosphere.

Abstract – Modern notations do not foresee princi-ple differences in <b>cathode</b> <b>spot</b> mechanisms in the breakdown stage as compared with steady burning arc. There is no reason to have doubts in this statement. Really, cathode spots generate similar craters regardless of discharge burning time under the condition of a cold cathode. <b>Cathode</b> <b>spot</b> plasma has rather stable parameters while gradual changes in plasma parameters can be convincingly explained in terms of cathode heating effects. The only difference is that the beginning stage gives a chance to trace a separate cycle of <b>cathode</b> <b>spot</b> operation and confidence that the initial moment of a cycle is a proper one. Unlike stable long-lasting arc, the first spot cycle is not hazy with prehistory; and spot behavior looks different as a result.
