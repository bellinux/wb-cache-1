50|$|A Woman in Amber {{begins with}} Agate Nesaule as an adult. She is a {{successful}} professor of Women’s Studies and 20th century American Literature at the University of Wisconsin Whitewater. Despite her outward professional success, Agate lives with an inner turmoil caused by her memories of war and perpetuated by her husband Joe. Nesaule finds herself in therapy, depressed and unable {{to come to terms}} with the root cause of her depression. On the advice of her therapist Ingeborg, Agate learns she <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> heal until she is able to tell her story; the story of what happened to her and her family during World War II in Latvia and Germany at the hands of the invading Russian soldiers.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a novel architecture for a hardware based network {{intrusion detection system}} (NIDS). NIDSs are becoming critical components of the network infrastructure as they serve as a key line of defense in network protection. However, current methods are much too compute intensive and <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> meet the bandwidth requirements of a moderate sized corporate network. Thus, hardware techniques are desired to speed up network processing. This paper introduces a FPGA based signature match processor that can serve as {{the core of a}} hardware based NIDS. The signature match processor’s key feature is a CAM-based cellular processor architecture that can match strings in an area efficient manner. Using a unique binary tree structure, we are also able to generate priority encoded addresses corresponding to multiple signature matches. 1...|$|E
40|$|Words <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> {{express my}} {{gratitude}} {{to all those}} that were instrumental in my successful completion of the doctoral program. I know that I did not accomplish this alone {{and that it was}} the support, encouragement, and prayers of my family, friends, and colleagues that gave me the ability to stay the course and achieve my goals. I would like to first thank a long time friend, Dr. Raheem A. Beyah for encouraging me to pursue a doctoral degree when I thought it was impossible. He continuously supported and guided me through this journey. I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. John A. Copeland for providing guidance through my research endeavors and the freedom to foster my own research ideas. It was an honor to work with someone of his stature. I am thankful to my thesis committee members, to my lab mates, Kathy Cheek, and the ECE administration. I {{would also like to thank}} all those that honored me with fellowships and scholarships that financially supported my education. Last, but definitely not least, I would like to acknowledge my daughter, Isis. She served as my motivation during this entire process...|$|E
60|$|Plural voting, though {{practiced in}} vestry {{elections}} {{and those of}} poor-law guardians, is so unfamiliar in elections to Parliament {{that it is not}} likely to be soon or willingly adopted; but as the time will certainly arrive when the only choice will be between this and equal universal suffrage, whoever does not desire the last <b>can</b> <b>not</b> too soon <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> reconcile himself to the former. In the mean time, though the suggestion, for the present, may not be a practical one, it will serve to mark what is best in principle, and enable us to judge of the eligibility of any indirect means, either existing or capable of being adopted, which may promote in a less perfect manner the same end. A person may have a double vote by other means than that of tendering two votes at the same hustings; he may have a vote in each of two different constituencies; and though this exceptional privilege at present belongs rather to superiority of means than of intelligence, I would not abolish it where it exists, since, until a truer test of education is adopted, it would be unwise to dispense with even so imperfect a one as is afforded by pecuniary circumstances. Means might be found of giving a farther extension to the privilege, which would connect it in a more direct manner with superior education. In any future Reform Bill which lowers greatly the pecuniary conditions of the suffrage, it might be a wise provision to allow all graduates of universities, all persons who have passed creditably through the higher schools, all members of the liberal professions, and perhaps some others, to be registered specifically in those characters, and to give their votes as such in any constituency in which they choose to register; retaining, in addition, their votes as simple citizens in the localities in which they reside.|$|R

Roueche, Jr., words <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> express my gratitude for your having faith in me and for the unwavering support you provided over the last two years. I am in your debt. To Dr. Kay McClenney, thank you for your friendship and guidance. Your grace and strength of character remind me that building a purposeful life requires that we transcend self-interest. To my good friend, Dr. Norvell Northcutt, thank you for your patience and for helping me see that although the work is important, never should we take ourselves too seriously. To Dr. William Moore, Jr., thank you for your kind words of support and for helping me better understand my responsibilities as a person who has been afforded unearned privileges in this society. Heartfelt thanks also go out to my dissertation committee members, Dr...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} is a document influenced by a traditional educational process, which {{is in contrast to}} my educational philosophy, i. e., in regards to my thesis project and my personal beliefs. I attempted to develop a high school based on the individual as the learner, in which he may reinforce his weak areas and strengthen his career goals. This is what I feel education should be, but presently the system forces students to build up school images or stereotype their professors. I took it upon myself to select a project that would challenge my weak areas in order to assure a learning experience during thesis year. My thesis project was an attempt to develop a strong philosophy and concept for the building environment to respond; this environment {{is more important than the}} structure itself. I set out to develop a learning environment in which the student feels is for him and not for the glory of the faculty, staff, or architect. My sole aim for this year was to learn, which I feel I accomplished quite well. The drawings were done to satisfy thesis requirements and do not reflect the total knowledge I gained. This document <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> represent the knowledge gained, and should not be looked upon as a final product. College of Architecture and PlanningThesis (B.

40|$|The general {{commodity}} price level, after declining 34 percent from 1925 - 1929 average levels {{during the past}} three years, returned to approximately pre-war levels in January, 1932. From then on, until September, 1932, it remained fairly stable. Since September, however, the general price level has been falling again at the rate of one or two points a month. How long the decline will continue, no one knows; but agriculture and industry <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> recover until the decline is arrested. The urgent need for some form of control of the general price level is steadily becoming greater. The present circular deals with the control of the general price level. It points out the need for this control, and shows what the Federal Reserve System has been doing to check deflation since the depression began. There is not space enough, however, for a presentation of some of the stronger reflationary measures that have recently been proposed. These measures will be presented and discussed in a later circular in this series. This is the fifth publication in the series dealing with the present agricultural emergency. The first circular in the series, 2 ̆ 7 The Situation Today, 2 ̆ 2 presented the main facts of the case. The second circular,. 2 ̆ 2 The Causes of the Emergency, 2 ̆ 2 dealt with the causative factor. The third circular was entitled 2 ̆ 2 The Domestic Allotment Plan. 2 ̆ 2 The fourth was entitled 2 ̆ 2 The Iowa Farm Mortgage Situation. 2 ̆ 2 The present circular, dealing with monetary questions, is the fifth in the series. A later circular will deal further with the same subject...|$|E
