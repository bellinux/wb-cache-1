500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X. [...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a <b>CD</b> <b>drive,</b> despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a <b>CD</b> <b>drive</b> and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons." ...|$|E
500|$|Up {{until the}} middle of 1991, Sega of America had been kept largely uninformed of the details of the project, without a {{functioning}} unit to test (although Sega of America was provided with preliminary technical documents earlier in the year). According to former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham, [...] "When you work at a multinational company, there are things that go well and there are things that don't. They didn't want to send us working Sega CD units. They wanted to send us dummies and not send us the working CD units until the last minute because they were concerned about what we would do with it and if it would leak out. It was very frustrating." [...] Even though they were not provided a functioning unit, Latham and Sega of America vice president of licensing Shinobu Toyoda put together a functioning Sega CD by acquiring a ROM for the system and installing it in a dummy unit. Further frustrating the Sega of America staff was the construction of the add-on. [...] "The Mega-CD was designed with a cheap, consumer-grade audio <b>CD</b> <b>drive,</b> not a CD-ROM," [...] stated Scot Bayless, former Sega of America senior producer. [...] "Quite late in the run-up to launch, the quality assurance teams started running into severe problems with many of the units—and when I say severe, I mean units literally bursting into flames. We worked around the clock, trying to catch the failure in-progress, and after about a week we finally realized what was happening," [...] citing the need for game titles to utilize more time seeking data than the <b>CD</b> <b>drive</b> was designed to provide.|$|E

40|$|In {{majority}} of Sugar Industries, to achieve better efficiency of power, VFDs are extensively used. Initially D. <b>C.</b> <b>Drives</b> were used, but now these are slowly getting phased out and {{are replaced by}} A. <b>C.</b> <b>Drives.</b> In {{a case study of}} Harmonic Analysis of SAMARTH CO-OPERATIVE SUGAR FACTORY, ANKUSH NAGAR, MAHAKALA, JALNA it is commonly seen perception that, latest technology A. <b>C.</b> <b>drives</b> are having in built harmonic filters and hence do not produce harmonics / produce harmonics within prescribed tolerance limit. Because of variation in load pattern these drives still produce harmonics, which must be suppressed by using appropriate Harmonic Filter, otherwise it may result into malfunction of sensitive devices. It is more essential to suppress these harmonics, for SAMARTH CO-OPERATIVE SUGAR FACTORY, ANKUSH NAGAR, MAHAKALA, JALNA, as Sugar Industry has grid connected Cogeneration plant. The suggested method of filter design gives better result, reduces harmonic level (5 th harmonics) to almost 10 A from 154 A. The values of load Kw, P.

2500|$|In August 1993, Nintendo {{announced}} the SNES's successor, code-named Project Reality.

The system was announced to be released by the end of 1995, but was subsequently delayed. Meanwhile, Nintendo continued the Nintendo Entertainment System family with the release of the NES-101, a smaller redesign of the original NES. Nintendo also announced a <b>CD</b> <b>drive</b> peripheral called the Super NES CD-ROM Adapter, which was co-developed first by Sony with the name [...] "Play Station" [...] and then by Philips.

2500|$|The rest of {{the tracks}} are usually in CD-ROM XA Mode 2 Form 2 and contain video and audio {{multiplexed}} in an MPEG program stream (MPEG-PS) container, but CD audio tracks are also allowed. Using Mode 2 Form 2 allows roughly 800 megabytes of VCD data to be stored on one 80 minute CD (versus 700 megabytes when using CD-ROM Mode 1). [...] This is achieved by sacrificing the error correction redundancy present in Mode 1. [...] It was considered that small errors in the video and audio stream pass largely unnoticed. [...] This, combined with the net bitrate of VCD video and audio, means that almost exactly 80 minutes of VCD content can be stored on an 80-minute CD, 74 minutes of VCD content on a 74-minute CD, and so on. This was done in part to ensure compatibility with existing <b>CD</b> <b>drive</b> technology, specifically the earliest [...] "1x" [...] speed CD drives.|$|E
