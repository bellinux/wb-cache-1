5|$|As Lord President of the Council, Dudley {{headed a}} {{distinctly}} conciliar government {{and sought to}} introduce the adolescent King into business. Taking over an almost bankrupt administration, he ended the costly wars with France and Scotland and tackled finances in ways that led to some economic recovery. To prevent further uprisings he introduced countrywide policing on a local basis, appointing Lords Lieutenants who were {{in close contact with}} the <b>central</b> <b>authority.</b> Dudley's religious policy was—in accordance with Edward's proclivities—decidedly Protestant, further enforcing the English Reformation and promoting radical reformers to high Church positions.|$|E
5|$|As Tikal and its {{hinterland}} reached peak population, {{the area}} suffered deforestation, erosion and nutrient loss {{followed by a}} rapid decline in population levels. Tikal and its immediate surroundings {{seem to have lost}} most of their population between 830 and 950 and <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> seems to have collapsed rapidly. There is not much evidence from Tikal that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbatún region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources.|$|E
5|$|During the Eastern Han, {{conscription}} {{could be}} avoided if one paid a commutable tax. The Eastern Han court favored the recruitment of a volunteer army. The volunteer army comprised the Southern Army (Nanjun 南軍), while the standing army stationed in and near the capital was the Northern Army (Beijun 北軍). Led by Colonels (Xiaowei 校尉), the Northern Army consisted of five regiments, each composed of several thousand soldiers. When <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> collapsed after 189 AD, wealthy landowners, members of the aristocracy/nobility, and regional military-governors relied upon their retainers to act as their own personal troops (buqu 部曲).|$|E
5000|$|In {{transnational}} criminal law, <b>Central</b> <b>Authorities</b> act {{as international}} nodes of coordination to receive and act upon {{mutual legal assistance}} and extradition requests from other countries. Many UN treaties, such as the UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) and the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) expressly call upon member states to designate <b>Central</b> <b>Authorities</b> in their government for just this purpose. [...] The lack of <b>Central</b> <b>Authorities</b> in developing countries, however, can pose challenges as, where such institutional architecture is lacking, states will generally be unable to offer assistance and, thus, unable to address many of the threats posed by transnational criminal groups and terrorist organizations.|$|R

5|$|Fajsz was {{the only}} known son of Jutotzas, the third son of Árpád who led the Hungarian tribes' {{confederation}} {{at the time of}} their conquest of the Carpathian Basin between around 895 and 907. After Árpád's death, fundamental changes happened in the government of the tribal confederation. Although the various tribes could even thereafter act in concert for raids, they did not obey a strong <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> any more.|$|E

Michael the Brave also adopted an anti-Ottoman policy, and upon his initiative Sigismund Báthory of Transylvania and Aaron the Tyrant of Moldavia (15911595) signed a treaty to form an anti-Ottoman alliance. The rebellion started by the massacre of all the Ottomans in Wallachia on November 13, 1594.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} forms of {{assimilation}} are still at work today. For example, when a <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> nationalizes one language, that attaches economic and social advantages to the prestige language. As generations pass, use of the indigenous language often fades or disappears, and linguistic and cultural identity recede as well. However, some groups are seeking to revive their indigenous identities. One important political aspect of this pursuit is petitioning the government for official recognition as a separate and distinct ethnic group.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{there had}} been rapid {{political}} development in the Arabian Peninsula, where Muhammad had been preaching Islam and by 630, he had successfully united most of the Arabia under a single political authority. When Muhammad died in June 632, Abu Bakr was elected Caliph and his political successor. Troubles emerged soon after Abu Bakr's succession, when several Arab tribes openly revolted against Abu Bakr, who declared war against the rebels. In {{what became known as}} the Ridda wars of 632–633, Abu Bakr managed to unite Arabia under the <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> of the Caliph at Medina.|$|E
5|$|Nyuserre {{is one of}} {{the very}} few Old Kingdom kings for whom there is {{evidence}} that the funerary cult continued uninterrupted during the First Intermediate Period, when the <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> of the pharaohs had broken down and the Egyptian state was in turmoil. The tombs of two priests Heryshefhotep I and II, who lived during this period, mention their roles and duties in the funerary establishment of Nyuserre, witnessing to the continuing existence of the official mortuary cult.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of 'joint' warfare {{was made clear}} to the Australian military during World War II when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands. Following the war, several senior officers lobbied for {{the appointment of a}} {{commander in chief of the}} three services. The government rejected this proposal and the three services remained fully independent. The absence of a <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> resulted in poor co-ordination between the services, with each service organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Espanyol {{was seen}} by the vast {{majority}} of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the <b>central</b> <b>authority,</b> in stark contrast to Barça's revolutionary spirit. Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Tombalbaye banned {{opposition}} parties {{and established a}} one-party system. Tombalbaye's autocratic rule and insensitive mismanagement exacerbated inter-ethnic tensions. In 1965, Muslims in the north, led by the National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT), began a civil war. Tombalbaye was overthrown and killed in 1975, but the insurgency continued. In 1979 the rebel factions led by Hissène Habré took the capital, and all <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> in the country collapsed. Armed factions, many from the north's rebellion, contended for power.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{importance}} of 'joint' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands, {{the absence of a}} <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> continued to result in poor co-ordination between the services in the post-war era, with each organising and operating {{on the basis of a}} different military doctrine. The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military's experiences in the Vietnam War. In 1973, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Arthur Tange, submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff.|$|E

5|$|Bloemfontein, {{the former}} British {{garrison}} town, became the Free State's capital; the Transvaal {{seat of government}} became Pretoria, named after the elder Pretorius. The South African Republic was in practice split between the south-west and central Transvaal, where most of Pretorius's supporters were, and regionalist factions in the Zoutpansberg, Lydenburg and Utrecht districts that viewed any <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> with suspicion. Kruger's first campaign as a commandant was {{in the latter part}} of 1854, against the chiefs Mapela and Makapan near the Waterberg. The chiefs retreated into what became called the Caves of Makapan ("Makapansgat") with many of their people and cattle, and a siege ensued in which thousands of the defenders died, mainly from starvation. When Commandant-General Piet Potgieter of Zoutpansberg was shot dead, Kruger advanced under heavy fire to retrieve the body and was almost killed himself.|$|E
5|$|In {{earliest}} recorded history, Norway {{was divided}} {{into a number of}} small and sometimes warring petty kingdoms with weak <b>central</b> <b>authority.</b> In traditional historiography the rise of Harald Fairhair in the 9th century started the process of unification of the country and the consolidation of royal power. Harald's descendants, and other claimants to the throne, had to contend with strong regional leaders such as the Jarls of Lade in the north and the rulers of Vingulmark in the east, while the kings of Denmark claimed regions in the south and were eager to acquire Norwegian vassals to increase their influence. The spread of Christianity also became an increasingly important political issue in the late 10th century.|$|E
5|$|In his New Policies {{sponsored}} by Shenzong, Wang Anshi enhanced <b>central</b> <b>authority</b> over Song's frontier administrations, increased militia activity, increased troop levels and war horses {{sent to the}} frontiers (including the border areas with Đại Việt), and actively sought loyal supporters in border regions who could heighten the pace of extraction of local resources for the state's disposal. Officials at court debated the merits or faults of Wang's policies, yet criticism of his reforms even appeared in Đại Việt, where the high officer Lý Thường Kiệt (1019–1105) publicly announced that Wang's policies were deliberate efforts to seize and control their border frontiers. Tensions between Song and Lý were critical, and in these conditions any sign of hostility had potential to ignite a war.|$|E
