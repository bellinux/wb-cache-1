It has been reported that an incident when the band were taping Dick Clark's TV show Where The Action Is in 1965 led to the ban. Ray Davies recalls in his autobiography, [...] "Some guy who said he worked for the TV company walked up and accused us of being late. Then he started making anti-British comments. Things like 'Just because the Beatles did it, every mop-topped, spotty-faced limey juvenile thinks he can <b>come</b> <b>over</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> make a career for himself." [...] following which a punch was thrown and the AFM banned them.|$|E

2500|$|Solicitor H.G. Bailey {{reminded}} {{the jury that}} the law presumed Patterson innocent, even if what Gilley and Price had described was [...] "as sordid as ever a human tongue has uttered." [...] Finally he defended the women, [...] "Instead of painting their faces ... they were brave {{enough to go to}} Chattanooga and look for honest work." [...] Bailey attacked the defense case.They say this is a frame-up! They have been yelling frame-up ever since this case started! Who framed them? Did Ory Dobbins frame them? Did brother Hill frame them? We did a lot of awful things over there is Scottsboro, didn't we? My, my, my.

Since you are bent on being an artist, and your Popper has consented and put you {{under the most}} {{expensive}} master in Paris, the least {{you can do is}} to follow the rules. And I dare say he only wanted you to 'sink the shop' in company. It's such horrid bad form for you artistic people to be always dragging out your sketch-books.

Take things as they come and do as others do; avoid all comparisons between French and English customs; fall in with the ways of those around you; and adopt {{as far as you}} can the polite and courteous manner which is general among the French, and in which, I must say, they are far ahead of us. If questioned, you will, of course, give your opinion frankly and modestly; it is the independence of thought among English boys which has attracted the attention and approval of Auguste de St. Caux.|$|R
