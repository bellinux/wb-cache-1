5|$|Sheet Harbour is a {{small rural}} {{community}} located on the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia, in the eastern area of the Halifax Regional Municipality. The catchment area around the community includes approximately 5,500 people. Sheet Harbour is located slightly more northward compared to other coastal communities in the area, due {{to the shape of}} the harbour. The population of <b>Census</b> <b>Tract</b> 2050154.00, which includes Sheet Harbour and a large amount of land around Sheet Harbour's land borders, is 3,478 as of the 2011 Canadian Census. Census tracts are small subdivisions of land that are used for statistics gathering by Statistics Canada that usually have a population of 2,500 to 8,000. Each <b>census</b> <b>tract</b> has a numerical designation. The population of the community of Sheet Harbour is about 800. Immediately west of Sheet Harbour is Sheet Harbour 36, a small Mi'kmaq reserve.|$|E

40|$|<b>Census</b> <b>tracts</b> are small, {{relatively}} permanent geographic entities within counties (or {{the statistical}} equivalents of counties) delineated {{by a committee}} of local data users. Generally, <b>census</b> <b>tracts</b> have between 2, 500 and 8, 000 residents and boundaries that follow visible features. When first established, <b>census</b> <b>tracts</b> are to be as homogeneous as possible with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Block numbering areas (BNAs) are geographic entities similar to <b>census</b> <b>tracts,</b> and delineated in counties (or the statistical equivalents of counties) without <b>census</b> <b>tracts.</b> For the 1990 census, the difference between <b>census</b> <b>tracts</b> and BNAs generally {{was the type of}} organization doing the delineation.

This method aims to be applied in places where the boundaries of <b>census</b> <b>tracts</b> changed between the two years, which makes impossible a direct comparison between them. The methodology is developed from {{the implementation of a}} geographic information system (GIS) using the program TerraView/INPE, with three main layers of information: the <b>census</b> <b>tracts</b> meshes of the two years, with their statistics, and a network of orthogonal points distant 100 m from each other, covering the two meshes. The operational procedure is based on the capture of statistical information of the <b>census</b> <b>tracts</b> of 1991 by the points network, followed by the transfer of information to the <b>census</b> <b>tracts</b> of 2000.
