5|$|In 1850 {{he gave up}} {{his career}} in science and entered the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg. He studied in academy under the {{historical}} painter Pyotr Basin until 1857. He graduated from the academy in 1857 with a gold medal for his painting The Witch of Endor <b>Calling</b> <b>Up</b> the Spirit of the Prophet Samuel. According to Ge himself, during that period he was strongly influenced by Karl Briullov.|$|E
5|$|Other critics emphasise {{that the}} letter's object, Lord Molesworth, was {{targeted}} to bind the higher and lower classes together. Using Molesworth, a religious dissenter, a nobleman, and {{the opposite of}} Swift, the Drapier unites all of the various people of Ireland in a common nationalist cause. Instead of defending charges against himself, the Drapier is <b>calling</b> <b>up</b> more support for the Irish cause; he seeks attention so that the greater liberty of Ireland will be respected.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel's {{unit was}} called up in March 1891 during the shearers' strike {{that had begun}} earlier that year. Leading his troops and a small {{detachment}} of Queensland Police, Chauvel was given the task of escorting a party of strikebreakers to a station north of Charleville. Near Oakwood, Chauvel's troops were confronted by a crowd of around two hundred mounted sheep shearers. When the inspector {{in charge of the}} police detachment arrested four of the shearers who were wanted by the police, the crowd became agitated, but Chauvel managed to disperse the crowd peacefully, and bring his charges safely to their destination. During the 1894 Australian shearers' strike, the Queensland government enrolled special constables rather than <b>calling</b> <b>up</b> the militia. Chauvel was appointed a temporary sub-inspector in Clermont, and later the district around Longreach.|$|E

Brad McKay, Jack Hamilton, Kevin McHattie, Jason Holt, Jamie Walker, David Smith, Callum Paterson and Jordan McGhee were <b>called</b> <b>up</b> to represent the under-21 squad.

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the war, the government's immediate response was to announce on 5 September 1939 that it would begin <b>calling</b> <b>up</b> 10,000 militiamen at a time to provide sixteen days continuous service manning guard posts at selected points around the country. This was later expanded on 15 September to include all of the Militia, in two drafts of 40,000 men, for one month's continuous training, however, the suspension on compulsory training introduced in 1929 was not amended until January 1940. On 5 September 1939 it was also announced that a division would be raised for overseas service, but there was still large-scale opposition to the concept of conscription and the provisions of the Defence Act still precluded conscripts from serving outside of Australian territory, so it was announced that this force would be raised from volunteers only and would not be raised directly from the Militia. Conscripts, however, were required to serve in the Militia, with the result being that the Militia's ranks were filled with both volunteers and conscripts during this time.|$|E
5|$|For {{nearly two}} weeks the French frigates {{remained}} at anchor, Malcolm and Grant drawing up plans for an attack with fireships, when Amazone successfully slipped out of harbour on 27 November, returning successfully to Le Havre before dawn the following day. With Amazone gone, Grant maintained a closer watch on Elisa, <b>calling</b> <b>up</b> a bomb vessel to attack the anchorage on 6 December. This proved no more accurate than the rockets, but Elisa was again driven into shallow waters to avoid the attack, this time becoming irretrievably grounded on a shoal. Over {{the next two weeks}} Elisa remained grounded, the frigate gradually being reduced to the state of a total wreck. On 23 December Grant sent his boats, commanded by Lieutenant Thomas Rowe, into the anchorage under cover of darkness and set the wreck on fire to ensure that the frigate's stores could not be salvaged.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the first battle, both sides set about making urgent repairs and <b>calling</b> <b>up</b> reinforcements. On 9 July a fleet of five Spanish and one French ship of the line and several frigates arrived from Cadiz to safely escort Linois's squadron to the Spanish port, and the British at Gibraltar redoubled their efforts to restore their squadron to fighting service. In the evening of 12 July the French and Spanish fleet sailed from Algeciras, and the British force followed them, catching the trailing ships in the Second Battle of Algeciras and opening fire at 11:20. A confused night action followed, in which the British ship HMS Superb cut through the disorganised allied rearguard, followed by the rest of Saumarez's force. In the confusion one French ship was captured, a Spanish frigate sank and two huge 112-gun Spanish first rates collided and exploded, killing as many as 1,700 men. The following morning the French ship Formidable came under attack {{at the rear of the}} combined squadron, but successfully drove off pursuit and reached Cadiz safely.|$|E

25|$|During the 1968–1974 period, Presidents Johnson and Nixon {{decided against}} <b>calling</b> <b>up</b> National Guard units for service in Vietnam.

25|$|The morning {{service is}} also uniquely {{characterized}} by the <b>calling</b> <b>up</b> of each male member (in some Orthodox, and {{in the majority of}} non-Orthodox congregations, male and female members) of the congregation for an aliyah. There is also a special aliyah for all the children (under 13 for boys and 12 for girls).|$|E

25|$|In Britain, {{conscription}} {{resulted in}} the <b>calling</b> <b>up</b> of nearly every physically fit man in Britain—six of ten million eligible. Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives. Most deaths were to young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers. In the United States, conscription began in 1917 and was generally well received, with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural areas.|$|E

25|$|Israel {{responded by}} <b>calling</b> <b>up</b> its {{civilian}} reserves, bringing {{much of the}} Israeli economy to a halt. The Israelis set up a national unity coalition, including {{for the first time}} Menachem Begin's party, Herut, in a coalition. During a national radio broadcast, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol stammered, causing widespread fear in Israel. To calm public concern Moshe Dayan (Chief of Staff during the Sinai war) was appointed Defence Minister.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of war, Henderson-Stewart sought {{to ensure that the}} system of National Service in the armed services worked smoothly; in November 1939, he criticised the operation of the scheme in <b>calling</b> <b>up</b> agricultural workers when the government was calling for farmers to plough more land. In the Norway Debate of May 1940, Henderson Stewart voted against Chamberlain. After Churchill took over as Prime Minister, Henderson-Stewart enlisted again in the Royal Artillery in which he served from September 1940 to June 1941.|$|E
25|$|While Pyrrhus {{had been}} campaigning against the Carthaginians, the Romans had rebuilt their army by <b>calling</b> <b>up</b> {{thousands}} of fresh recruits.

After the inconclusive Battle of Beneventum in 275 BC, Pyrrhus decided to end his campaign in Italy and return to Epirus {{which resulted in the}} loss of essentially all the gains he had made in Italy. However, the city of Tarentum remained under the dominion of the Epirotes.|$|E

25|$|On May 1, 1952, 14 {{months after}} his {{promotion}} to Captain in the Marine Corps Reserve, Williams was recalled to active duty for service in the Korean War. He had not flown any aircraft for eight years but he turned down all offers to sit out the war in comfort {{as a member of}} a service baseball team. Nevertheless, Williams was resentful of being called up, which he admitted years later, particularly regarding the Navy's policy of <b>calling</b> <b>up</b> Inactive Reservists rather than members of the Active Reserve.|$|E
25|$|Preparations {{for a new}} {{campaign}} required first and foremost the assembly of troops at a designated base. In Assyria, the designated locations included Nineveh, Kalhu or Khorsabad. On some occasions the designated meeting points would change depending upon the campaign. Governors were instructed to accumulate supplies of grain, oil and war material. Other requirements of the Governors included <b>calling</b> <b>up</b> the needed manpower. Vassal states were in particular required to present troops {{as part of their}} tribute to the Assyrian King and in good time - failure to do so, would have almost certainly been seen as an act of rebellion.|$|E
