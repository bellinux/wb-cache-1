40|$|Most {{governments in}} Sub-Saharan Africa have a capital {{spending}} problem. They don’t spend {{enough money to}} build or improve infrastructure that is in obviously short supply.

This is an unfortunate solution, not just for the weakness in state capacity that it perpetuates, and the fiscal space it frees up for countries to undertake expensive <b>commercial</b> <b>borrowing,</b> but also because it links unnecessary debt to necessary infrastructure. I propose a private sector-based solution that links infrastructure spending to contemporaneous revenues, in which the useful functions of the development agency are opened up to competition and the debt financing is replaced by markets for political risk. This solution could not only reduce the cost and debt burden of building infrastructure, but also create high-powered incentives that would solve the weaknesses in state capacity that made debt-linked infrastructure necessary in the first place...|$|E
