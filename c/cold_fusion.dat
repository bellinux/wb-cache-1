40|$|The {{interfacial}} {{properties of}} palladium electrode in sulfate solutions of different pH values {{have been investigated}} using the piezoelectric response of surface stress change induced by a potential modulation.

The pH dependence of pzc was measured in the range from pH 0. 7 to 12. 8. Below pH 6. 0, pzc was close to the equilibrium potential of hydride formation.

The piezoelectric signals obtained in the potential region of oxide formation suggested that sign-rever-sal of surface charge takes place in the potential range of PdO monolayer formation which is similar to Pt electrode.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} {{provided evidence}} of piezonuclear reactions occurring in condensed matter during electrolysis. These experiments {{were characterized by}} significant neutron and alpha particle emissions, together with appreciable variations in the chemical composition at the electrode surfaces. A mechanical reason for the so-called <b>Cold</b> Nuclear <b>Fusion</b> was recently proposed by the authors. The hydrogen embrittlement due to H atoms produced by the electrolysis plays an essential role for the observed micro-cracking in the electrode host metals (Pd and Ni). Consequently, our hypothesis is that piezonuclear fission reactions may occur in correspondence to the micro-crack formation or propagation. In order to confirm the early results obtained by the Ni-Fe and Co-Cr electrodes and presented in the companion paper (Part I), electrolytic tests have been conducted using 100 % Pd at the cathode and 90 % Ni at the anode. As a result, relevant compositional changes {{and the appearance of}} elements previously absent have been observed on the Pd and Ni electrodes after the experiments, as well as significant neutron emissions. The most relevant process emerging from the experiment is the primary fission of palladium into iron and calcium. Then, secondary fissions of both the products as well as of nickel in the other electrode appear in turn producing oxygen atoms, alpha particles, and neutrons...|$|R

40|$|All {{scientists}} know well: {{to achieve}} nucleus fusion, {{a temperature of}} {{hundreds of millions of}} degrees is required. Only in this case, the kinetic energy of nucleus overcomes the repulsive electric force of nucleus and connects two initial nucleuses into a single nucleus. In the last sixty years, scientists have spent tens of billion US dollars attempting to develop useful thermonuclear fusion energy. Yet, today they still cannot reach a stable long-period thermonuclear reaction. They still are promising publically, after many years of effort, and additional tens of billions of US dollars to finally design the expensive but ultimately workable industrial installation, which possibly will produce electric energy more expensive than current heat, wind and hydro-electric stations can in 2015. Author, instead, uses well-known physical laws and shows the other andcheaperway: very low temperatures (0. 01 ÷ 10 K) and high-pressure (some thousands or millions of atmospheres) allows reaching the same results: thermonuclear fusion. He does not use kinetic energy of nucleus again repulsive force of nucleus, as in the long-touted conventional plasma confinement method. Instead, he uses the blocking the repulsive forces of nucleus by electrons (sphere Debya), very low-temperatureand high-pressure. In current time to reach these temperature and pressure are easily than hundreds millions degrees by magnetic or inertial confinement. New method for thermonuclear fusion is relatively cheap and allows use of other thermonuclear fuel which are less expensive and which produce theaneutronic reaction.
