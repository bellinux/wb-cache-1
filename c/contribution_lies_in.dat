6000|$|Certain favourers of Wordsworth answer our {{question}} with a triumphant affirmative, {{on the strength}} of some ethical, or metaphysical, or theological system which they believe themselves to find in him. But is it credible that poets can permanently live by systems? Or is not system, whether ethical, theological, or philosophical, the heavy lead of poetry? Lucretius is indisputably one of the mighty poets of the world, but Epicureanism is not the soul of that majestic muse. So with Wordsworth. Thought is, on the whole, predominant over feeling in his verse, but a prevailing atmosphere of deep and solemn reflection does not make a system. His theology and his ethics, and his so-called Platonical metaphysics, have as {{little to do with the}} power of his poetry over us, as the imputed Arianism or any other aspect of the theology of Paradise Lost has to do with the strength and the sublimity of Milton, and his claim to a high perpetual place in the hearts of men. It is best to be entirely sceptical as to the existence of system and ordered philosophy in Wordsworth. When he tells us that [...] "one impulse from a vernal wood may teach you more of man, of moral evil and of good, than all the sages can," [...] such a proposition cannot be seriously taken as more than a half-playful sally for the benefit of some too bookish friend. No impulse from a vernal wood can teach us anything at all of moral evil and of good. When he says that it is his faith, [...] "that every flower enjoys the air it breathes," [...] and that when the budding twigs spread out their fan to catch the air, he is compelled to think [...] "that there was pleasure there," [...] he expresses a charming poetic fancy and no more, and it is idle to pretend to see in it the fountain of a system of philosophy. In the famous Ode on Intimations of Immortality, the poet doubtless does point to a set of philosophic ideas, more or less complete; but the thought from which he sets out, that our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting, and that we are less and less able to perceive the visionary gleam, less and less alive to the glory and the dream of external nature, as infancy recedes further from us, is, with all respect for the declaration of Mr. Ruskin to the contrary, contrary to notorious fact, experience, and truth. It is a beggarly conception, no doubt, to judge as if poetry should always be capable of a prose rendering; but it is at least fatal to the philosophic pretension of a line or a stanza if, when it is fairly reduced to prose, the prose discloses that it is nonsense, and there is at least one stanza of the great Ode that this doom would assuredly await. Wordsworth's claim, his special gift, his lasting <b>contribution,</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> the extraordinary strenuousness, sincerity, and insight with which he first idealises and glorifies the vast universe around us, and then makes of it, not a theatre on which men play their parts, but an animate presence, intermingling with our works, pouring its companionable spirit about us, and [...] "breathing grandeur upon the very humblest face of human life." [...] This twofold and conjoint performance, consciously and expressly--perhaps only too consciously--undertaken by a man of strong inborn sensibility to natural impressions, and systematically carried out in a lifetime of brooding meditation and active composition, is Wordsworth's distinguishing title to fame and gratitude. In [...] "words that speak of nothing more than what we are," [...] he revealed new faces of nature; he dwelt on men as they are, men themselves; he strove to do that which has been declared to be the true secret of force in art, to make the trivial serve the expression of the sublime. [...] "Wordsworth's distinctive work," [...] Mr. Ruskin has justly said (Modern Painters, iii. 293), [...] "was a war with pomp and pretence, and a display of the majesty of simple feelings and humble hearts, together with high reflective truth in his analysis of the courses of politics and ways of men; without these, his love of nature would have been comparatively worthless." ...|$|E

5000|$|Professor Casti {{elaborated}} {{the theory}} of cartographic semiosis in 1998, when she also published her first theoretical book L’ordine del mondo e la sua rappresentazione, translated into English in 2005 under the title Reality as Representation. The semiotics of cartography and the generation of meaning. Casti’s theory lies within the fold of the research area called “postmodern cartography” inaugurated by John B. Harley in 1989 and developed {{in the first decade}} of the 21st century with contributions by Emanuela Casti, Jeremy Crampton, Martin Dodge, Rob Kitchin, John Pickles, Denis Wood. The underlying assumption of postmodern research is a questioning of the objectivity and neutrality of maps, and more specifically a questioning of the scientific nature of Euclidean metrics. Accordingly, maps are not seen as straightforward “mirrors of reality”, but rather as instruments through which reality is shaped. Casti’s key <b>contribution</b> <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> having embraced this initial assumption as a springboard for articulating a theory able to investigate the construction and the communicative mechanisms of maps. By shifting the focus of interest from maps as tools for mediating territory to maps as operators which actively affect the range of activities one can implement on territories, Casti’s theory earmarked the areas in which action is needed in order to take control of the communicative outcomes of mapping. Assuming a symbiosis between territory and mapping, Casti conclusively defines maps as complex denonational acts, on the basis of which individuals appropriate territory intellectually and symbolically order the world. Maps should be taken as instances of a “metasemiosis" [...] - or “second-level semiosis”, for even though they are based on territorial semiosis they also deploy signs, names, symbols which convey messages and meanings quite independently of the intentions of those who first produced them. Maps, Casti insists, are endowed with self-reference, which produces its own messages and may well lead an interpreter to read the world through the framework of theory and to advance entirely conjectural propositions as if they were facts (in this regard, Casti speaks of iconization). Casti rereads the theoretical framework of Charles Morris, whereby signs in communication become sign vehicles activated by an interpreter, to show a cartographic semiosis based on icons (a key feature of maps) and analyzed in light of three aspects: in the encoding of signs (semantics); in the syntax that connects icons and develops their meanings in a reticular dimension; in the pragmatic sphere, when maps become the objects of interpretation as well as key models for socially relevant patterns of behavior. Within such theoretical framework, maps become sophisticated instruments capable of suggesting and envisioning strategies of production, use and mediatization of territory to their interpreters. According to Casti, this network provides not only the platform for an interpretation of cartographic documents, but also for actual experimenting with maps, now tailored to the changing needs of society; maps that are designed to envisage a topological space, as Casti’s second theoretical book makes clear (Cartografia critica, translated in English as: Reflexive Cartography, 2015). Professor Casti explores the transition from a topographic mapping, created by government agencies, to open cartography, collaboratively produced by the people (and linked to a new idea of Chorography). The latter has the potential to become a highly workable concept, to be used as an operator for assisting citizens in thinking and designing their own living space and in understanding the current world. Specifically, Casti argues that, by virtue of its highly interactive features, new digital mapping (specifically WebGIS) opens up new scenarios, and poses cybercartography as a privileged discipline for recovering and promoting the social significance of territory in all its forms (landscape and environment).|$|E

The proposed approach effectively involves real-time estimation of the diffuse albedos of the real scene, and essentially relighting these areas to take virtual shadows into account.
