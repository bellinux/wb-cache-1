5|$|Academics {{estimate}} that the Court of <b>Chancery</b> formally split from and became independent of the curia regis in the mid-14th century, at which time it consisted of the Lord Chancellor and his personal staff, the <b>Chancery.</b> Initially an administrative body with some judicial duties, the <b>Chancery</b> experienced an explosive growth in its work during the 15th century, particularly under the House of York, which academics attribute to its becoming an almost entirely judicial body. From the time of Elizabeth I onwards the Court was severely criticised for its slow pace, large backlogs, and high costs. Those problems persisted until its dissolution, despite being mitigated somewhat by reforms, particularly during the 19th century. Attempts at fusing the <b>Chancery</b> with the common law courts began in the 1850s, and finally succeeded with the 1873 and 1875 Supreme Court of Judicature Acts, which dissolved the <b>Chancery</b> and created a new unified High Court of Justice, with the <b>Chancery</b> Division – one of three divisions of the High Court – succeeding the Court of <b>Chancery</b> as an equitable body.|$|E
5|$|As {{keeper of}} the seal, and {{subsequently}} as chancellor, Neville was noted for his impartiality, and he oversaw a number {{of changes in the}} way the <b>chancery</b> operated. Neville was deprived of the Great Seal in 1238 after quarrelling with the king, but continued to hold the title of chancellor until his death. He died in his London palace, built on a street later renamed <b>Chancery</b> Lane owing to his connection with the <b>chancery.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1345 the Lord Chancellor {{began to}} be seen {{as the leader of the}} Court of <b>Chancery,</b> rather than as a {{representative}} of the King, and writs and bills were addressed directly to him. Under Richard II it became practice to consider the <b>Chancery</b> separate from the curia; academic William Carne considers this a key moment in confirming the independence of the Court of <b>Chancery.</b> The Chancellor and his clerks often heard the cases directly, rather than having them referred to the council itself; occasionally a committee of lay and church members disposed of them, assisted by the judges of the common law courts. John Baker argues that it was the late 14th century that saw <b>Chancery</b> procedure become fixed, citing the work done by John Waltham as Master of the Rolls between 1381 and 1386, and notes that this period also saw the first complaints about the <b>Chancery.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{title and}} office {{existed at the}} Imperial Court (cf. Cod. Theod., VI, 16, [...] "De primicerio et notariis"), whence they passed into all the royal <b>chanceries,</b> though {{in the course of}} time the term notary ceased to be used. This was the case also with the <b>chanceries</b> of the pope, the great episcopal sees, and even every bishopric.|$|R
50|$|The earlier Roman notaries (tabelliones) {{had their}} own {{traditional}} formulæ, and the drafting of their acta was subject to an infinity of detail; the imperial <b>chanceries</b> of Rome and Byzantium were more remarkable still for their formulæ. The <b>chanceries</b> of the barbarian kingdoms {{and that of the}} papacy followed in their footsteps. Nevertheless it is usually not directly from the <b>chanceries</b> that the formularies drawn up in the Middle Ages have come down to us, but rather from the monastic and ecclesiastical schools. Therein was taught, as pertaining to the study of law, the art of drafting public and private documents. It was called dictare as opposed to scribere, i. e. the mere material execution of such documents.|$|R
5|$|Major Kean {{returned}} to {{the ground floor of}} the <b>Chancery</b> and ordered his men to withdraw into a large semicircle at the main entrance to the <b>Chancery.</b> Most of the Marines were inside the <b>Chancery</b> when the crowds outside the Embassy broke through the gates into the compound. The Marines closed and bolted the <b>Chancery</b> door, the elevators were locked by Seabees on the sixth floor and the Marines withdrew up the stairwells locking grill gates behind them. On the ground floor a water tanker was driven through the <b>Chancery</b> door and the crowd began to surge up through the building toward the rooftop. The Marines on the rooftop had sealed the doors and were using Mace to discourage the crowd from trying to break through. Sporadic gunfire from around the Embassy passed over the rooftop.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} part of a large reform {{movement}} to prevent equitable courts such as the Court of <b>Chancery</b> from undermining their business. It was far cheaper and faster than the older equivalents used by the <b>Chancery</b> and Common Pleas, leading to a drop in their business and an increase in that of the King's Bench. As such, the <b>Chancery</b> issued injunctions in an ineffective attempt to prevent its use. The Bill was finally abolished by the Uniformity of Process Act 1832.|$|E

5|$|Central to Gray's was {{the system}} shared across the Inns of Court of {{progress}} towards {{a call to}} the Bar, which lasted approximately 12 to 14 years. A student would first study at either Oxford or Cambridge University, or at one of the Inns of <b>Chancery,</b> which were dedicated legal training institutions. If he studied at Oxford or Cambridge he would spend three years working towards a degree, and be admitted to one of the Inns of Court after graduation. If he studied at one of the Inns of <b>Chancery</b> he would do so for one year before seeking admission to the Inn of Court to which his Inn of <b>Chancery</b> was tied—in the case of Gray's Inn, the attached Inns of <b>Chancery</b> were Staple Inn and Barnard's Inn.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{had such}} trust in his {{chancellor}} and the chancellor's clerks that Burnell and the clerks {{were allowed to}} dispense with the hanaper system, which required fees for sealing charters to be paid into the hanaper department of the <b>Chancery</b> for disbursal. Robert and his clerks were permitted to enjoy the profits from the fees of their office. Burnell was also responsible for the decision to force the Court of <b>Chancery</b> to settle in London, rather than following the king and his court around the country. A <b>Chancery</b> memorandum of 1280 records that the chancellor, {{along with the other}} ministers, now had the duty of sorting the many petitions that came into the government and only passing on the most urgent to the king.|$|E
5|$|For several centuries, {{education}} {{at one of}} the Inns of <b>Chancery</b> was the first step towards becoming a barrister. A student would first join one of the Inns of <b>Chancery,</b> where he would be taught in the form of moots and rote learning. He would also be taught by Readers sent from the Inn of Court that his Inn of <b>Chancery</b> was attached to, who would preside over the moots and discuss cases with the students. At the end of each legal term, particularly promising students would be transferred to the parent Inn of Court and begin the next stage of their education. By 1461 there were approximately 100 students studying at the Inns of <b>Chancery</b> at any one time.|$|E
40|$|In {{its first}} part, this article dwells upon the {{pluralism}} and {{the complex nature}} of the documentary system in the Este dominion between the fifteenth and the sixteenth century: both are well shown by {{the structure of the}} princely archive and the control exerted on their archives by the governed communities. Nevertheless, what is afterwards underlined is the importance of institutional, documentary and administrative links; through them, territorialization and reciprocal legitimation practices took place among the varied political agents. Special stress is laid on the existence of ducal territorial <b>chanceries,</b> on their interaction with urban <b>chanceries</b> and on the creation of specular series of registers, with particular reference to the evolution of urban copialettere, where a shared elaboration of norms occurred between the fifteenth and the sixteenth century...|$|R

5|$|From its foundation, the Court of <b>Chancery</b> could {{administer}} estates, {{due to its}} {{jurisdiction over}} trusts. While the main burden in the 16th century fell on the ecclesiastical courts, their powers over administrators and executors was limited, regularly necessitating the Court of Chancery's involvement. Before the Statute of Wills, many people used feoffees to dispose of their land, something that fell {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Lord Chancellor anyway. In addition, in relation to the discovery and accounting of assets, the process used by the Court of <b>Chancery</b> was far superior to the ecclesiastical one; as a result, the Court of <b>Chancery</b> was regularly used by beneficiaries. The common law courts also had jurisdiction over some estates matters, but their remedies for problems were far more limited.|$|E
5|$|From the 13th century onwards, the Court of Common Pleas could issue its own writs, {{and was not}} {{dependent}} on the Court of <b>Chancery,</b> where such documents usually originated. These were sealed with the Great Seal of the King until at least 1338, along with the seal of the justices; the <b>Chancery</b> writs had their own independent seal. Documents were, from 1350, considered acceptable if only marked with the seal of the justices. In 1344, the king created a separate seal for the Common Pleas, allowing them to process cases without involving the <b>Chancery</b> or the king. The court stood {{on an equal footing}} with the Exchequer of Pleas, Court of <b>Chancery</b> and King's Bench in relation to transferring cases between them. Any errors {{on the part of the}} Common Pleas would be corrected by the King's Bench through a separate action brought there. Thanks to the Bill of Middlesex and other legal fictions, the King's Bench gained much of the Common Pleas's jurisdiction, although the Common Pleas remained the sole place where real property claims could be brought.|$|E
5|$|In the {{administration}} of his diocese, Hugh introduced new methods of recording documents.

5|$|Some of the {{information}} contained in the Liber is important to historians. It is in the Liber that the first statement that Æthelwold translated the Benedictine Rule into Old English is made. The Liber is the longest of the local histories produced in England during the 12th century, and it contains a description of the royal <b>chancery,</b> which might be the earliest evidence for the existence of that office in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The Liber describes how King Edgar (died 975) granted the abbey the office of chancellor (head of the <b>chancery),</b> but the authenticity of the passage is unclear. The existence of a formal <b>chancery</b> office in Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman Conquest is a matter of some debate amongst historians.|$|E
5|$|The Inns of <b>Chancery</b> or Hospida Cancellarie were a {{group of}} {{buildings}} and legal institutions in London initially attached to the Inns of Court and used as offices for the clerks of <b>chancery,</b> from which they drew their name.

5|$|The Inns of <b>Chancery</b> {{sprung up}} around the Inns of Court, and took their name and {{original}} purpose from the <b>chancery</b> clerks, who used the buildings as hostels and offices where they would draft their writs. As with the Inns of Court the precise dates of founding of the Inns of <b>Chancery</b> are unknown, but the one commonly {{said to be the}} oldest is Clifford's Inn, which existed from at least 1344. Thavie's Inn, founded in 1349, is considered to be the next oldest, and several legal historians mistakenly considered it the oldest of them all.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Inns of <b>Chancery</b> {{was used as}} {{accommodation}} and offices by solicitors, the other branch of the English legal profession. During {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries the purpose of the Inns changed. After the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642, the practice of teaching barristers in the Inns ceased, and as a result the Inns of <b>Chancery</b> became a dedicated association for solicitors instead, offering offices and accommodation. The foundation of the Society of Gentlemen Practisers and Law Society of England and Wales in 1739 and 1825 respectively as professional bodies for the solicitors profession relegated the Inns of <b>Chancery</b> to little more than eccentric dining clubs, and they were gradually dissolved and sold. In 1897 a popular book reported that nobody could remember the purpose of the buildings and that an 1850 investigation had failed to uncover their origins. The last Inn to be sold was Clement's Inn, which was sold in 1903, and demolished in 1934.|$|E
