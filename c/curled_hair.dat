In the neighbourhood, a shop attendant told the police that the actual name of the victim was Josef and that he was often {{in the company of a}} Finnish-looking man. Thanks to this testimony, the police were able to identify Josef ben Meddour, aged 36, an Algerian national. Settled in Sweden for about ten years, Meddour was gay, and the Finnish-looking man was his boyfriend.|$|E

500|$|The {{monolith}} of Gomateshwara {{commissioned by}} Chavundaraya {{is considered the}} high point of the Ganga sculptural contribution in ancient Karnataka. Carved from fine-grained white granite, the image stands on a lotus. It has no support up to the thighs and is [...] tall with the face measuring [...] With the serene expression {{on the face of the}} image, its <b>curled</b> <b>hair</b> with graceful locks, its proportional anatomy, the monolith size, and the combination of its artistry and craftsmanship have led it to be called the mightiest achievement in sculptural art in medieval Karnataka. It is the largest monolithic statue in the world. Their free standing pillars called Mahasthambha or Bhrahmasthambha are also considered unique, examples of which are the Brahmadeva pillar and Tyagada Brahmadeva Pillar. At the top of the pillar whose shaft (cylindrical or octagonal) is decorated with creepers and other floral motifs is the seated Brahma and the base of the pillar normally has engravings of important Jain personalities and inscriptions.|$|E
500|$|After being {{attacked}} by the crows, Homer is seen being treated by Dr. Hibbert at the Springfield General Hospital. While there are no visible scars on him, the character instead has a slightly <b>curled</b> <b>hair.</b> During a color screening of the scene, Homer's body looked [...] "a little too bloody" [...] and damaged, prompting the staff to change it. [...] "One thing I learned {{a long time ago}} is, you gotta be careful how you change [...] basic model pack", Jean said in the episode's DVD commentary. He also said that he was happy that many viewers identify with the characters and don't want to see them get hurt or injured in any way. [...] "They don't mind if [...] falls down a cliff but [...] he should recover." [...] While working on the episode, the series' staff debated what size to make Homer's pupils when he is under the influence of marijuana. Because a common effect of smoking marijuana is to get dilated pupils, the animators initially suggested to widen them, but settled on only dilating Homer's pupils slightly.|$|E

She coupled it with metallic plates on her shoulder and a wig with long <b>curled</b> <b>hair.</b> Madonna and her dancers emerged from behind backdrops, on which Timbaland and Timberlake appeared, to perform their lines. An apparent duet between Madonna and Timberlake ensues, with Timberlake singing and dancing his part from the screens. He joined Madonna in person, for the show at Los Angeles's Dodger Stadium on November 6, 2008, the same show in which Britney Spears appeared alongside Madonna to perform [...] "Human Nature". They performed [...] "4 Minutes" [...] in similar fashion to the promotional tour choreography.

One of his hands rests on Nandi bullâ€™s left horn, Shiva's mount, which is fairly well preserved. The pair of hands at the back is also bejewelled; the right hand of the male side holds a serpent, while the left hand of the female side holds a mirror. The front left hand is broken, while {{a large part of}} the lower half of the panel was damaged at some point. Around the Ardhanarishwara are three layers of symbolic characters.

Above them are gods and goddesses such as Brahma, Vishnu, Indra and others who are seated on their vahanas. Above them are flying apsaras approaching the fused divinity with garlands, music and celebratory offerings.|$|E
500|$|In the Sticky & Sweet Tour, [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] was {{performed}} as the closing {{song of the}} [...] "Futuristic rave with Japanese influence" [...] section. During the last segment of the show, Madonna wore a futuristic robotic dress with plates on her shoulder and a wig with long <b>curled</b> <b>hair.</b> She opened the breastplate from the previous performance, and started singing [...] "Give It 2 Me". Parts of the lyrics of the song flashed on the screens {{in the style of}} a shooter video game, featuring 1980s games like Space Invaders and Asteroids. Gradually, more and more dancers joined Madonna, and together they started jumping on stage. Williams appeared on the screens to sing his lines. He made a special guest appearance, for the performances of [...] "Give It 2 Me", at the Madison Square Garden stop of the tour. Near the end of the performance, Madonna asked the crowd to sing along with her while she shouted, [...] "No one is ever going to stop me". The performance ended with video backdrops showing Madonna's sweaty, unsmiling, exhausted face, as she disappeared behind the reformed cubicle-shaped screens, which showed the words, 'Game Over', and [...] "Holiday" [...] started playing in the background.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also {{added to the}} six song set list of the Hard Candy Promo Tour in 2008. Madonna wore a shiny black outfit with black tails, Adidas track pants and high-heeled, lace-up boots. [...] "Hung Up" [...] was the fourth song of the set list. It was re-invented as a heavy-metal version. As the {{performance}} of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] ended, Madonna picked up an electric guitar and played the first few chords of The Rolling Stones single [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". She then asked the crowd whether {{they thought they had}} come to a Rolling Stones concert. When the crowd responded negatively, she started [...] "Hung Up", while dedicating it to all the people who had waited outside in the queue to watch the show. She declared that the noisy, metallic guitar breakdown of the song symbolised what waiting sounded like in the brain of all those who had waited. The song was performed in the futuristic rave with Japanese influences segment of the 2008 Sticky & Sweet Tour. Madonna wore a futuristic robotic outfit designed by Heatherette, with plates on her shoulder and a wig with long <b>curled</b> <b>hair.</b> The similar heavy-metal version of [...] "Hung Up" [...] was performed but it later gave way to the ABBA music. Before starting the performance, she played a capella versions of her older hit songs on audience demand, mostly [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and [...] "Like a Virgin". However, after that, the electric guitar was played to make noises, which Madonna dedicated to Republican vice-presidential nominee for the 2008 election, Sarah Palin. She said, [...] "I'd like to express myself to Sarah Palin right now. [...] This is the sound of Sarah Palin thinking. [...] Sarah Palin can't come to my party. Sarah Palin can't come to my show. It's nothing personal." [...] The performance ended with Madonna playing the guitar riff of [...] "A New Level" [...] by heavy-metal band Pantera. For the second European leg of the tour in 2009, [...] "Hung Up" [...] was removed from the setlist and was replaced by an up-beat version of [...] "Frozen".|$|E
50|$|<b>Curling</b> and {{straightening}} <b>hair</b> {{requires the}} stylist {{to use a}} curling rod or a flat iron to get a desired look. These irons use heat to manipulate the hair {{into a variety of}} waves, curls and reversing natural curls and temporarily straightening the hair. Straightening or even <b>curling</b> <b>hair</b> can damage it due to direct heat from the iron and applying chemicals afterwards to keep its shape.There are irons that have a function to straighten or <b>curl</b> <b>hair</b> even when its damp (from showering or wetting the hair), but this requires more heat than the average iron(temperatures can range from 300-450 degrees). Heat protection sprays, and hair repairing shampoos and conditioners can protect the hair from damage caused by the direct heat from the irons.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, Benaderet befriended Paul Henning, a {{scriptwriter}} {{on the radio}} production of Burns & Allen. She appeared on nineteen episodes of the show that he had written between 1947 and 1951, {{and became one of}} his regular television players with the first two seasons of Burns & Allen, a two-episode guest appearance as Blanche Morton on The Bob Cummings Show in 1956-57, and then her involvement in three of the most successful sitcoms of the 1960s. After reading the 1961 first script for The Beverly Hillbillies, Benaderet wanted to audition for the role of Granny. Despite considering her to be too buxom for his vision of the character as a small and wiry woman, Henning allowed her to test anyway. Irene Ryan would win the part; according to Henning, [...] "Bea {{took one look at the}} way Irene did the part and said to me, 'There's your Granny!'" [...] He additionally took Benaderet's suggestion of casting Harriet MacGibbon as Granny's rival Margaret Drysdale. Henning created for Benaderet the supporting character of Cousin Pearl Bodine, the middle-aged widowed mother of Jethro Bodine (Max Baer Jr.) and cousin of main character Jed Clampett (Buddy Ebsen), whom she convinces to move from his humble home in the Ozarks after he strikes oil on his property and becomes a millionaire. Prior to shooting the pilot, Benaderet enlisted a dialect coach to help her learn a hillbilly accent. Impressed with her performance while screening the pilot to potential sponsors, Henning made Cousin Pearl a recurring character in the 1962-63 first season as she moved into the Clampetts' Beverly Hills mansion, feuded with Granny, and pursued oil tycoon Mr. Brewster (Frank Wilcox) as a love interest. Bluegrass duo Flatt & Scruggs, who performed the show's opening theme, recorded a comedic serenade in 1963 titled [...] "Pearl Pearl Pearl", and Benaderet was pictured with the duo on the single's cover. Benaderet described Pearl's curly hair as [...] "just my mental image of the character. ... Pearl played the piano for the silent movies and she saw such high fashion and ridiculous hairdos. She could read and write, and the <b>curled</b> <b>hair</b> seemed to Pearl the height of smartness." [...] Her performance as Pearl was well received; author Stephen Cox wrote in his 1993 book The Beverly Hillbillies: From the Small Screen to the Big Screen: [...] "When The Beverly Hillbillies first aired, it started to become 'The Bea Benaderet Show.' Every scene that had Cousin Pearl in it was just about stolen by the actress." ...|$|E
