50|$|A second {{category}} of solutions are primarily strategic. In repeated interactions cooperation might emerge when people adopt a Tit for tat strategy (TFT). TFT {{is characterized by}} first making a cooperative move while the next move mimics {{the decision of the}} partner. Thus, if a partner does not <b>cooperate,</b> <b>you</b> copy this move until your partner starts to cooperate. Computer tournaments in which different strategies were pitted against each other showed TFT to be the most successful strategy in social dilemmas. TFT is a common strategy in real-world social dilemmas because it is nice but firm. Consider, for instance, about marriage contracts, rental agreements, and international trade policies that all use TFT-tactics.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} writing this thesis was to improve methods during {{requirements}} engineering phase. Usercentred system engineering has some problem areas, which are examined and verified {{to create a}} new guideline for developers. This guideline tends to make requirements engineering more effective and help developers create more concrete requirements. It is not uncommon that system development projects ends up with unsatisfied users or delay in deliveries. The reasons are different kinds of communication problems between users and developers during verification of requirements. There is a therapy model, called solution-focused therapy, used in family and individual therapy. The model focuses on solutions for the future instead of problems in the past. This method has never been used in system developing until today. Based on literature studies and scenarios we have shown {{that it is possible to}} transfer this pedagogy into the system developing branch especially in requirements engineering. During our investigation we have shown that the pedagogy refute the difficulties within usercentred design. The pedagogy model can be used in four kinds of methods for capturing requirements; questionnaires, interviews, workshops and observations. The model activates and makes the user more implicated. To show this, we have applied the pedagogy model on scenarios taken from earlier experiences of requirements engineering. The outcome of this investigation is that developers can create a more pleasant communication atmosphere with this pedagogy. A result of this is that users becomes more willing and helpful {{to create a new}} system and therefore makes it easier for developers and users to <b>cooperate.</b> <b>You</b> can avoid many communication problems if you know how to go around them...|$|E

40|$|Theory of Mind (ToM) is {{the ability}} to {{attribute}} mental states (e. g., beliefs and desires) to other people in order to understand and predict their behaviour. If others are rewarded to compete or <b>cooperate</b> with <b>you,</b> then what they will do depends upon what they believe about you. This is the reason why social interaction induces recursive ToM, of the sort "I think that you think that I think, etc. ". Critically, recursion is the common notion behind the definition of sophistication of human language, strategic thinking in games, and, arguably, ToM. Although sophisticated ToM is believed to have high adaptive fitness, broad experimental evidence from behavioural economics, experimental psychology and linguistics point towards limited recursivity in representing other's beliefs. In this work, we test whether such apparent limitation may not in fact be proven to be adaptive, i. e. optimal in an evolutionary sense. First, we propose a meta-Bayesian approach that can predict the behaviour of ToM sophistication phenotypes who engage in social interactions. Second, we measure their adaptive fitness using evolutionary game theory. Our main contribution is to show that one does not have to appeal to biological costs to explain our limited ToM sophistication. In fact, the evolutionary cost/benefit ratio of ToM sophistication is non trivial. This is partly because an informational cost prevents highly sophisticated ToM phenotypes to fully exploit less sophisticated ones (in a competitive context). In addition, cooperation surprisingly favours lower levels of ToM sophistication. Taken together, these quantitative corollaries of the "social Bayesian brain" hypothesis provide an evolutionary account for both the limitation of ToM sophistication in humans as well as the persistence of low ToM sophistication levels...|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} {{potential}} benefits of involving university students in research (as researchers, not subjects). It can help students to increase their retentive knowledge in the subject they study, and also develop research skills such as problem framing and analysis. While disciplines such as psychology and medicine have a tradition of students contributing to research publications, Design and Product Development does not. This indicates an untapped potential for researchers in these fields to more actively engage their students in their work. In the spring of 2014, we {{made an effort to}} involve Interaction Design master’s students in our research. It was in a Product Development course on "User Requirements Elicitation”. The research itself dealt by comparison with the effectiveness of two research methods; namely, individual interviews compared to group interviews. During the course, students in groups made a quantitative and qualitative comparison of the two methods. The initiative of involving the students in research was evaluated in terms of: •	Quality of the conducted research. •	The students’ knowledge development of the course topic. •	The students’ development of research skills. •	The students’ experiences and perceptions of the research initiative. Furthermore, the goal was to provide some explanations on why these effects occurred, and show implications for future initiatives of a similar kind. In retrospect, {{it was clear that the}} students did not appreciate this initiative. Their opinion was that it did not have a high enough “pay-off” in relation to their efforts. The course received very low scores when the students evaluated it. However, we could see quite clearly that they had developed an in-depth knowledge of the compared methods. The students also discussed issues such as reliability and validity of their research in a way that we had not seen in the course in its previous years. Although the results of the experiment were particularly encouraging in terms of knowledge generation and research skills’ development due to the all-time low course ratings of the student evaluation there will not be a continuation of the course in the current form. In general our advice for teachers wanting to do research with students is the following: •	If it is part of a course, be aware of the challenges this conveys. In particular, be aware of the students' expectations and try to make the research-based part of the course its main objective, rather than something they perceive as “extra work” •	Make them true co-researchers. Take part in the “simpler” tasks yourself and let them take part in the more advanced tasks. They will learn more by actively working with you, than by merely <b>cooperating</b> with <b>you</b> through an asynchronous division of the work in the research process. This will also have a positive effect on the scientific quality of the research, which may suffer if the students work on their own...|$|R
30|$|The goal of {{the network}} Figure  1 is to {{allocate}} power among players in order to stimulate {{all of them to}} cooperate. Obviously, each player tries to get the highest possible payoff. Let us predict the behavior of the players after having known the definition of the game. Suppose that the players k 1 [*]and k 2 [*]find an opportunity to meet each other. Obviously, they quickly take advantage to cooperate and achieve payoff distribution x[*]=[*][0.4, 0.4, 0]. Then, it is profitable for player k 1 [*]to invite player k 3 [*]to join, therefore improving its own payoff from 0.4 to 0.6 and that of player k 3 [*]from zero to 0.2. On the other hand, this new agreement causes a decreasing payoff of player k 2 [*]from 0.4 to 0.2, and now the players k 2 [*]and k 3 [*]have an incentive to cooperate and increase their proper payoff from 0.2 to 1 / 3. Note that this agreement makes the player k 1 ’s payoff decrease from 0.6 to 1 / 3. The unfavorable decision of player k 2 [*]would tempt player k 1 [*]to retaliate. A negotiation between k 1 [*]and k 3 [*]to release cooperation with k 2 [*]results increasing their payoffs and boiling down k 2 ’s payoff to zero. The result of the above argument concerns the network is sustained by only one pair cooperation under the threat of ‘If <b>you</b> <b>cooperate</b> with the third player, then I will do the same’. a[*]It is fairly clear that the players would seek to cooperate only as pairs for the purpose of negotiation, and not cooperate in the grand coalition framework, even though the game is superadditive. This {{is due to the fact}} of being superadditive but not balanced. The pairs can be changed as time goes on. In fact, the core apportionment suffers the lack of ‘farsighted’ (i.e., long-term)stability.|$|R
40|$|EXTENDED ABSTRACT: Through a close {{analysis}} of a single paragraph of J. Rawls’s A Theory of Justice, I examine {{his position on the}} issue of desert and show how it {{does not take into account}} the separateness of persons. As it is widely known, one of the charges that Rawls addresses to utilitarianism is the criticism that it does not take seriously the individuality of any person, because of the monistic principle of preference aggregation, which seems essential to the very idea of utilitarianism as social-political philosophy. I think that Rawlsian accusation against utilitarianism can be revolted against Rawls himself. Since the two Rawlsian principles of justice (liberty and difference) shape all social institutions and model a fair social cooperation, the benefit and burdens of cooperation must ultimately be judged also from a foundational perspective, that is from the perspective of perfect procedural justice. The perfect procedural justice, using Kantian terminology, is the transcendental condition of our critical judgment on any institution and on any action with social significance. It represents, in other words, the condition of possibility of institutions in accordance with the two principles. The call for fairness is nothing more than this: calling for corrections in accordance with the two principles. But which kind of call? Since equity has this corrective dimension, common sense thinks that this claim consists of and is based upon some qualities of the subject, in particular, some of his/her moral qualities, which have been violated. Some of these qualities can be grouped under the name of “moral desert”. Justice should represent, according to common sense, the realization of some desert, or at least should be sensitive to the recognition of individual desert. The goods should be distributed according to the Aristotelian principle of “to each his own”: this seems to be the appropriate conception, prima facie and intuitively, of the realization of justice in our imperfect world, as far as at least it can be in accordance with the circumstances, always inadequate, of an empirical life. Does Rawls mean that the application of the principle of giving “to each his own” is impossible? On the one hand, the answer seems to be positive, because the notion of distribution according to virtue fails to distinguish between moral desert and legitimate expectations. Indeed, we do not expect that a judicial decision or a general political decision is structured by the amount of virtue of the subject who the decision is addressed to. Such procedure would be appropriate, for example, in a caste system society, but not in a society worried to outline some general and/or initial conditions of opportunity (constrained by insurance terms of choice, for example). A distribution of justice according to virtue then would violate the conditions of fairness. The fact that liberal citizens, having done various things encouraged by the existing arrangements, have now certain rights, and just distributive shares honor these claims, recognizes what might be considered a social truism: if you are going to <b>cooperate,</b> then <b>you</b> are reasonably waiting for a symmetrical cooperative behavior from your partner. The fact is, indeed, that your personal acquisitions, your claims, a proper ascription of your own deserts make sense only within a scheme that is not your product. In a certain way, you, as a citizen of a society properly adequate with the concept of well-ordered society, are the product. The legitimate expectations that arise are designed on justice as fairness. But the acceptance of a particular social asset is less a voluntary act than the product of your insurance rationality, the most important part of the theory of justice. When you join a just social asset you recognize what is already in you, and this is precisely your being entitled to citizenship within a well-ordered society. But then is there any distinction between the possession of a valid entitlement for something and desert? I thinks it is not. The conclusion that should be drawn from this discussion is that the rawlsian critique of utilitarianism – not taking seriously into account the real separateness of person – should be fully ascribed to his theoretical construction too...|$|R
60|$|Not having met the Chancellor at home, {{either on}} my first visit or my second after {{receiving}} his letter, and fearful that the Cabinet should come to come unpleasant resolution, I went to the Treasury on Friday. There I saw Sir G. Cooper. I possessed him {{of the danger of}} a partial, and the inevitable mischief of the total rejection of the bill. I reminded him of the understood compact between parties, upon which the whole scheme of the toleration originating in the English bill was formed,--of the fair part which the Whigs had acted in a business which, though first started by them, was supposed equally acceptable to all sides, and the risk of which they took upon themselves, when others declined it. To this I added such matter as I thought most fit to engage government, as government,--not to sport with a singular opportunity which offered for the union of every description of men amongst us in support of the common interest of the whole; and I ended by desiring to see Lord North upon the subject. Sir Grey Cooper showed a very right sense of the matter, and in a few minutes after our conversation I went down from the Treasury chambers to Lord North's house. I {{had a great deal of}} discourse with him. He told me that his ideas of toleration were large, but that, large as they were, they did not comprehend a promiscuous establishment, even in matters merely civil; that he thought the established religion ought to be the religion of the state; that, in this idea, he was not for the repeal of the sacramental test; that, indeed, he knew the Dissenters in general did not greatly scruple it; but that very want of scruple showed less zeal against the Establishment; and, after all, there could no provision be made by human laws against those who made light of the tests which were formed to discriminate opinions. On all this he spoke with a good deal of temper. He did not, indeed, seem to think the test itself, which was rightly considered by Dissenters as in a manner dispensed with by an annual act of Parliament, and which in Ireland was of a late origin, and of much less extent than here, a matter of much moment. The thing which seemed to affect him most was the offence that would be taken at the repeal by the leaders among the Church clergy here, on one hand, and, on the other, the steps which would be taken for its repeal in England in the next session, in consequence of the repeal in Ireland. I assured him, with great truth, that we had no idea among the Whigs of moving the repeal of the test. I confessed very freely, for my own part, that, if it were brought in, I should certainly vote for it; but that I should neither use, nor did I think applicable, any arguments drawn from the analogy of what was done in other parts of the British dominions. We did not argue from analogy, even in this island and United Kingdom. Presbytery was established in Scotland. It became no reason either for its religious or civil establishment here. In New England the Independent Congregational Churches had an established legal maintenance; whilst that country continued part of the British empire, no argument in favor of Independency was adduced from the practice of New England. Government itself lately thought fit to establish the Roman Catholic religion in Canada; but they would not suffer an argument of analogy to be used for its establishment anywhere else. These things were governed, as all things of that nature are governed, not by general maxims, but their own local and peculiar circumstances. Finding, however, that, though he was very cool and patient, I made no great way in the business of the Dissenters, I turned myself to try whether, falling in with his maxims, some modification might not be found, the hint of which I received from your letter relative to the Irish Militia Bill, and the point I labored was so to alter the clause as to repeal the test quoad military and revenue offices: for these being only subservient parts in the economy and execution, rather than the administration of affairs, the politic, civil, and judicial parts would still continue in the hands of the conformists to religious establishments. Without giving any hopes, he, however, said that this distinction deserved to be considered. After this, I strongly pressed the mischief of rejecting the whole bill: that a notion went abroad, that government was not at this moment very well pleased with the Dissenters, as not very well affected to the monarchy; that, in general, I conceived this to be a mistake,--but if it were not, the rejection of a bill in favor of others, because something in favor of them was inserted, instead of humbling and mortifying, would infinitely exalt them: for, if the legislature had no means of favoring those whom they meant to favor, as long as the Dissenters could find means to get themselves included, this would make them, instead of their only being subject to restraint themselves, the arbitrators of the fate of others, and that not so much by their own strength (which could not be prevented in its operation) as by the coöperation of those whom they opposed. In the conclusion, I recommended, that, if they wished well to the measure which was the main object of the bill, they must explicitly make it their own, and stake themselves upon it; that hitherto all their difficulties had arisen from their indecision and their wrong measures; and to make Lord North sensible of the necessity of giving a firm support to some part of the bill, and to add weighty authority to my reasons, I read him your letter of the 10th of July. It seemed, in some measure, to answer the purpose which I intended. I pressed the necessity of the management of the affair, both as to conduct and as to gaining of men; and I renewed my former advice, that the Lord Lieutenant should be instructed to consult and <b>cooperate</b> with <b>you</b> in the whole affair. All this was, apparently, very fairly taken.|$|R
