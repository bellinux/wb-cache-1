30|$|One hundred eighty-seven {{patients}} who completed treatment with [177 Lu]-DOTA-TATE and underwent PTS for dosimetry calculation {{were included in}} this retrospective study.

30|$|Based on {{preliminary}} {{observations of}} the low variability of the kidney absorbed dose across successive cycles of treatment administered empirically, we hypothesized that the <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> would be correlated to the absorbed dose after the first cycle(s).

30|$|Among the {{patients}} who did not complete 4  cycles, 14 were stopped because of an expected kidney absorbed dose after the following cycle higher than 25  Gy.

We withheld PRRT if the expected cumulated absorbed dose after the subsequent treatment was predicted to exceed 25  Gy for kidneys (except for very specific cases where cost/benefit ratio led us to continue treatment).

30|$|For 60 {{induction}} cycles in 15 patients, the dosimetry {{analysis was}} performed independently by three observers having different backgrounds and purposely varied levels of experience in internal dosimetry. Observer 1 (M.D.P.), a certified endocrinologist, current PRRT Fellow and Ph.D. student, performed 258 of the 279 primary analyses described in this paper and, as such, accumulated the most experience with this dosimetry procedure. Observer 2 (F.A.) was a certified nuclear medicine physician and current Nuclear Oncology fellow who performed 21 primary analyses. Observer 3 (N.S.) was an M.D. student who was new to both nuclear medicine and dosimetry and who received only a short training. Relative errors of per-cycle and <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> between each pair of observers were computed for the reference method (3 TP) and the two most accurate simplified methods.|$|R
30|$|Fractionation of {{the therapy}} is {{necessary}} for the practically achievable specific activities of the radionuclides considered. Fractionation will lead to higher <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> in tumours and has been shown to lead to lower probability of renal toxicity in clinical application of radionuclide therapy [35]. Fractionation of therapy with 177 Lu-DOTA-octreotate in rats with CA 20948 tumours has been shown to reduce renal toxicity while maintaining the same tumour response as for the single fraction therapy [36]. This reduction in renal toxicity was also influenced by the time interval between the fractions; renal toxicity was significantly reduced for intervals of a week or longer compared to a 1 -day interval. This inter-fraction recovery of renal damage is not fully explained by the repair mechanism within the LQ model [37]. In clinical practice, 177 Lu-DOTA-octreotate is given in four fractions of 7.4 GBq with a 6 -week interval, also in order to allow the bone marrow to recover [38].|$|R
30|$|We {{used the}} {{predicted}} Y values method [30] (chapter 19 and 20) to predict score on D 2 + D 3 + D 4 for each possible value of D 1, on D 3 or D 3 + D 4 for each possible value of D 1 and D 2 and on D 4 for each possible value of D 1, D 2, and D 3. The {{probability that the}} <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> DT after 3 or 4  cycles exceeds 25  Gy {{was obtained from the}} t statistic values with a p value <[*] 0.1 considered significant. For the probability of erroneously precluding a cycle of treatment that would not have led to the <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to exceed 25  Gy, a p value of 0.05 was considered significant. We deliberately chose a different p value for these two probability since the side effects of PRRT are less well established than its efficiency.|$|E
30|$|For D 1 [*]=[*] 6.2  Gy, the {{probability}} of DT exceeding 25  Gy after 4  cycles is 18.7 % while by choosing a higher safety threshold of 29  Gy as proposed in refs.

30|$|For {{patients}} with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with 177 Lu-octreotate {{is an effective}} palliative treatment that rarely causes serious toxicity [1, 2]. PRRT has been mostly administered as a 4 -cycle induction course using a fixed injected activity (IA) of not more than 7.4  GBq per cycle, in order to not exceed <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> of 23  Gy to the kidney and 2  Gy to the bone marrow (BM) {{in the majority of}} patients [1 – 4]. However, {{it is well known that}} for these critical organs, and in particular for the kidney which is the dose-limiting organ for most patients, the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> per IA is highly variable and usually lower than 23  Gy per 4  cycles, resulting in most patients being undertreated with such an empiric PRRT regime [5, 6]. We and others have proposed personalized PRRT (P-PRRT) protocols in which the number of fixed IA cycles or the IA per cycle are modulated to deliver a safe prescribed renal <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose,</b> with the aim to maximize tumor irradiation while keeping the toxicity low [4, 6]. Such P-PRRT protocols require careful dosimetry monitoring, which is often perceived as a complex and resource-consuming process, therefore constituting a barrier for wide clinical adoption. As a result, the clinical practice of “one-size-fits-all” PRRT prevails, at the potential cost of delivering a suboptimal treatment to most patients.|$|R
40|$|The {{studies of}} occupationally exposed workers to {{radiation}} {{have been based}} on recorded annual radiation doses. Monitoring programs in Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC) use thermoluminescent dosimeter which measures the whole body dose and not the actual dose to the organs and tissues.

The organ doses averaged over a cohort of occupationally exposed workers were estimated for the purpose of the ongoing cancer risk analysis. The skin indicates to be more susceptible organ to radiation with high mean dose of 1. 15 ± 0. 59 mGy/ 5 yrs and followed by the thyroid and the female breast with the mean dose of 0. 90 ± 0. 46 mGy/ 5 yrs and 0. 72 ± 0. 38 mGy/ 5 yrs respectively.

SPSS was used to analyze the recorded data. Consequently the estimated mean annual cancer risks indicated low estimates as compared to the international reference levels.

Post-treatment scans (PTS) are acquired after each cycle of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with [177 Lu]-DOTA-TATE for personalized radiation dosimetry in order to ensure a <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to kidneys under a safety threshold of 25  Gy.|$|E

30|$|The {{slope of}} the {{testosterone}} absorption curve is less steep indicating that the skin of X. laevis represents a greater barrier to the uptake of testosterone compared to caffeine. Nevertheless, the steepest slope was reached within the first hour of exposure (Fig.  1). Similar to caffeine experiments, testosterone permeated slowest across freshly excised dorsal skin. However, the differences between freshly excised and frozen skin {{and the location of}} the skin sites were not as clearly defined as for caffeine absorption [see (Additional file 2) for detailed information on <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> for each time point]. Percentages of testosterone after 8  h found in the receptor fluids were slightly less than mean percentages of caffeine absorbed after 4  h, ranging between 66.5  ±  6.3 and 84.8  ±  5.7  % (Table  1). Non-absorbed doses of testosterone washed off the skin surface after 8  h ranged from 9.6  ±  1.8 to 21.5  ±  4.1  %. With regard to the content of testosterone within the skin, trends were similar to those of caffeine: the highest percentage of testosterone was contained within freshly excised dorsal skin accounting for 16.5  ±  1.9  % of the applied dose. The maximum absorption rates, ranging from 5.3  ±  0.5 to 12.0  ±  5.6  µg/(cm 2  h), and maximum permeability coefficients, ranging from 1.3  ±  0.1 to 3.0  ±  1.4  ×  10 − 3  cm/h, again demonstrated that the skin of X. laevis seemed to be a greater barrier for testosterone than caffeine uptake.|$|R
40|$|Following {{contamination}} {{from the}} Chernobyl accident in April 1986 excess infant leukemia (0 – 1 y) was reported from five different countries, Scotland, Greece, Germany, Belarus and Wales and Scotland combined. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> to the fetus, as conventionally assessed, varied from 0. 02 mSv in the UK through 0. 06 mSv in Germany, 0. 2 mSv in Greece and 2 mSv in Belarus, {{where it was}} highest. Nevertheless, the effect was real and given the specificity of the cohort {{raised questions about the}} safety of applying the current radiation risk model of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) to these internal exposures, a matter which was discussed in 2000 by Busby and Cato [7, 8] and also in the reports of the UK Committee examining Radiation Risk from Internal Emitters. Data on infant leukemia in the United Kingdom, chosen {{on the basis of the}} cohorts defined by the study of Greece were supplied by the UK Childhood Cancer Research Group. This has enabled a study of leukemia in the combined infant population of 15, 466, 845 born in the UK, Greece, and Germany between 1980 and 1990. Results show a statistically significant excess risk RR = 1. 43 (95 % CI 1. 13 < RR < 1. 80 (2 -tailed); p = 0. 0025) in those born during the defined peak exposure period of 01 / 07 / 86 to 31 / 12 / 87 compared with those born between 01 / 01 / 80 and 31 / 12 / 85 and 01 / 01 / 88 and 31 / 12 / 90. The excess risks in individual countries do not increase monotonically with the conventionally calculated doses, the relation being biphasic, increasing sharply at low doses and falling at high doses. This result is discussed in relation to fetal/cell death at higher doses and also to induction of DNA repair. Since the cohort is chosen specifically on the basis of exposure to internal radionuclides, the result can be expressed as evidence for a significant error in the conventional modeling for such internal fetal exposures...|$|R
30|$|The main aim of {{this work}} was to compare, over the whole series of treatment, the {{dosimetry}} results for the kidneys and bone marrow based on the “classical” protocol to those based on a new protocol. In the “classical” one, dosimetry {{is calculated based on}} a SPECT and CT after each cycle. In the new one, the dosimetry is calculated based on a SPECT after each cycle of treatment but on one single CT for all the cycles. Individual patient dosimetry along the treatment is used to design a patient-tailored treatment schedule. At our institution, before giving a subsequent PRRT treatment, the <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> to the kidneys and bone marrow during the previous p treatments are examined and an expected cumulative dose after the following (p[*]+[*] 1) cycle is determined. The latter is calculated as the mean dose over the previous p treatments to which is added the <b>cumulative</b> <b>dose</b> <b>absorbed</b> over these p treatments. In our institution, we withheld PRRT if the expected cumulated dose after the next treatment will exceed by 10 % the safe dose limits, i.e., 25.3  Gy for the kidneys and 2.2  Gy for the bone marrow (except for very specific clinical setups where cost/benefit ratio led us to continue treatment beyond these limits). In this work, we compared the actual patient management (whether or not treatment was stopped due to dosimetry) to the hypothetical management of the patient, had we used the new “single CT” protocol.|$|R
30|$|Understanding the {{correlation}} between the tumor <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> and tumor response is crucial for the optimization of PRRT outcome.

A reliable dosimetry method is thus mandatory in order to improve the efficacy/toxicity balance and achieve patient-specific treatment planning. More specifically, pre- and peri-therapeutic dosimetry might help us gain better knowledge of PRRT therapeutic window, hence, allowing the prediction of the maximal absorbed dose to the tumors while minimizing radiation burden to the critical organs.|$|E

30|$|Lutetium- 177 -DOTA-(Tyr 3)-octreotate ([177 Lu]-DOTA-TATE) is {{used for}} peptide {{receptor}} radionuclide therapy (PRRT) of metastatic progressive neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Its efficiency has been proven by several studies [1 – 3] compared to cold somatostatin analogs. Commonly, recommended schedule of treatment with [177 Lu]-DOTA-TATE consists of a so-called empiric protocol of four fixed doses of 7.4  GBq (200  mCi) infusions every 6 – 12  weeks [1, 4 – 6]. This protocol is {{in accordance with the}} Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) approval and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) summary of product characteristics [7, 8], provided that the <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the most radiosensitive non-pathological tissues will not exceed safety limits [9 – 12]. The main late side effects of this treatment are myelotoxicity and renal toxicity [10, 12 – 16]. Therefore, the limiting factor of the administered dose is the radiation dose to the critical organs, kidneys and bone marrow. Nevertheless, it has been pointed out by Sandström [17] that the dose to bone marrow is rarely a limiting factor (1.5 % of the patients). The true threshold of the kidney dose that predisposes patients to toxicity is not precisely known. Preliminary works estimate its value around 23  Gy [17 – 19] based on external beam radiotherapy, whereas others argue for absorbed doses of about 30  Gy [12, 20]. In our institution, treatment series is stopped if the expected <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> will exceed 25  Gy, unless otherwise decided by a multidisciplinar staff based on assessment of the individual benefit/risk ratio. The occurrence of toxicity in the patients with high cumulative kidney absorbed dose may be related to risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension [5, 12]. Individual dosimetry by quantitative single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) after each cycle of treatment monitors the <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the organs at risk to decide whether the patient can receive more cycles of treatment. Following the EANM/MIRD guidelines [21], it is recommended to perform full dosimetry after the first treatment with three SPECT/CT acquisitions at 24, 96, and 168  h after the administration of [177 Lu]-DOTA-TATE. For the subsequent treatment cycles, only a single SPECT/computed tomography (CT) study approximately 24  h after the treatment is performed assuming an unchanged effective half-life of [177 Lu]-DOTA-TATE between treatments as proved and proposed by Garske et al. [22].|$|E
30|$|Conclusively, the {{cellular}} response to ionizing radiation {{is complex and}} differs with <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose.</b> The response acquired at high <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> cannot be extrapolated down to low <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> or vice versa.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} therapeutic efficacy and normal tissue toxicity of single dosage and fractionated targeted alpha therapy (TAT) in mice with HER 2 -expressing breast and ovarian cancer xenografts using the low dose rate radioimmunoconjugate (227) Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-trastuzumab. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Nude mice carrying HER 2 -overexpressing subcutaneous SKOV- 3 or SKBR- 3 xenografts were treated with 1000 kBq/kg (227) Th-trastuzumab as single injection or four injections of 250 kBq/kg with intervals of 4 - 5 days, 2 weeks, or 4 weeks. Control animals were treated with normal saline or unlabeled trastuzumab. In SKOV- 3 xenografts tumor growth to 10 -fold size was delayed (p< 0. 01) and survival with tumor diameter less than 16 mm was prolonged (p< 0. 05) in all TAT groups compared to the control groups. No statistically significant differences were seen among the treated groups. In SKBR- 3 xenografts tumor growth to 10 -fold size was delayed in the single injection and 4 - 5 days interval groups (p< 0. 001) and all except the 4 weeks interval TAT group showed improved survival to the control groups (p< 0. 05). Toxicity was assessed by blood cell counts, clinical chemistry measurements and body weight. Transient reduction in white blood cells was seen for the single injection and 4 - 5 days interval groups (p< 0. 05). No significant changes were seen in red blood cells, platelets or clinical chemistry parameters. Survival without life threatening loss of body weight was significantly prolonged in 4 weeks interval group compared to single injection group (p< 0. 05) for SKOV- 3 animals and in 2 weeks interval group compared with the 4 - 5 days interval groups (p< 0. 05) for SKBR- 3 animals. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The same concentration of radioactivity split into several fractions may improve toxicity of (227) Th-radioimmunotherapy while the therapeutic effect is maintained. Thus, it might be possible to increase the <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> radiation <b>dose</b> to tumor with acceptable toxicity by fractionation of the dosage...|$|R

30|$|Peptide {{receptor}} {{radionuclide therapy}} (PRRT) is a promising treatment {{for patients with}} neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Recently, the NETTER- 1 trial [6] showed that treatment with 177 Lu-DOTATATE results in markedly longer progression-free survival and higher response rate than treatment with high-dose octreotide alone in patients with advanced midgut NET. In September 2017, 177 Lu-DOTATATE (LUTATHERA®) was approved for this indication by the European Medicines Agency. It {{has been shown that}} 177 Lu-DOTATATE uptake in kidneys and tumors greatly varies among patients [7], and bone marrow and kidneys are considered as dose-limiting organs. Although no clear <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> cut-off has been identified in PRRT with 177 Lu to predict the risk of organ failure, which is probably multifactorial [4, 8], 23  Gy for kidneys and 2  Gy for bone marrow are sometimes proposed, although these values are based on studies with fractionated external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) that has different physical and radiobiological mechanisms. For example, based on fractionated EBRT, a 5 % risk of renal dysfunction at 5  years has been described for a mean absorbed dose of 18 – 23  Gy and 0.5 – 1.25  Gy/fraction [9, 10].|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Peptide {{receptor}} {{radionuclide therapy}} (PRRT) {{is used in}} tumours expressing type 2 somatostatin receptors (sst 2), mainly neuroendocrine. The aim of this prospective phase I-II study was to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of 177 Lu-DOTATATE in multiple cycles. Methods: Fifty-one consecutive patients with unresectable/metastatic sst 2 -positive tumours, divided into two groups, received escalating activities (3. 7 - 5. 18 GBq/cycle, group 1; 5. 18 - 7. 4 GBq/cycle, group 2) of 177 Lu-DOTATATE. Cumulative activities ranged from 3. 7 to 29. 2 GBq (median 26. 4 GBq in median 6 cycles, group 1, 21 patients) and 5. 55 to 28. 9 GBq (median 25. 2 GBq in 4 cycles, group 2, 30 patients), based on dosimetry. Results: No major acute or delayed renal or haematological toxicity occurred (one grade 3 leukopenia and thrombocytopenia). <b>Cumulative</b> renal <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> were 8 - 37 Gy (9 - 41 Gy bioeffective doses). A median decrease of creatinine clearance of 21. 7 % 6 months after PRRT, 23. 9 % after 1 year and 27. 6 % after 2 years was observed. Higher losses (> 20 %) {{occurred in patients with}} risk factors for renal toxicity, particularly hypertension and diabetes. Cumulative bone marrow doses were < 1. 5 Gy. Blood elements showed a progressive mild drop during cycles and recovered during follow-up (median 30 months). Thirty-nine patients were progressive at enrolment. Partial and complete responses occurred in 15 of 46 (32. 6 %) assessable patients. The median time to progression was 36 months. Overall survival was 68 % at 36 months. Nonresponders and patients with extensive tumour involvement had lower survival. Conclusion: 177 Lu-DOTATATE was well tolerated up to 29 GBq cumulative activity (up to 7. 4 GBq/cycle). The maximum tolerated dose/cycle was not reached. However, considering the individual bone marrow function and the presence of risk factors for kidney toxicity, it seems safer to divide cumulative activities into lower activity cycles.

40|$|AbstractThe U. S. EPA's SHEDS-Multimedia {{model was}} applied to enhance the {{understanding}} of children's exposures and doses to multiple pyrethroid pesticides, including major contributing chemicals and pathways. This paper presents combined dietary and residential exposure estimates and cumulative doses for seven commonly used pyrethroids, and comparisons of model evaluation results with NHANES biomarker data for 3 -PBA and DCCA metabolites. Model input distributions were fit to publicly available pesticide usage survey data, NHANES, and other studies, then SHEDS-Multimedia {{was applied to}} estimate total pyrethroid exposures and doses for 3 – 5 year olds for one year variability simulations. For dose estimations we used a pharmacokinetic model and two approaches for simulating dermal absorption. SHEDS-Multimedia predictions compared well to NHANES biomarker data: ratios of 3 -PBA observed data to SHEDS-Multimedia modeled results were 0. 88, 0. 51, 0. 54 and 1. 02 for mean, median, 95 th, and 99 th percentiles, respectively; for DCCA, the ratios were 0. 82, 0. 53, 0. 56, and 0. 94. Modeled time-averaged <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> of the seven pyrethroids was 3. 1 nmol/day (versus 8. 4 nmol/day for adults) {{in the general population}} (residential pyrethroid use and non-use homes) and 6. 7 nmol/day (versus 10. 5 nmol/day for adults) in the simulated residential pyrethroid use population. For the general population, contributions to modeled cumulative dose by chemical were permethrin (60 %), cypermethrin (22 %), and cyfluthrin (16 %); for residential use homes, contributions were cypermethrin (49 %), permethrin (29 %), and cyfluthrin (17 %). The primary exposure route for 3 – 5 year olds in the simulated residential use population was non-dietary ingestion exposure; whereas for the simulated general population, dietary exposure was the primary exposure route. Below the 95 th percentile, the major exposure pathway was dietary for the general population; non-dietary ingestion was the major pathway starting below the 70 th percentile for the residential use population. The new dermal absorption methodology considering surface loading had some impact, but did not change the order of key pathways...|$|E
40|$|The {{radiation}} {{environment on}} LDEF was monitored by <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> measurements made with TLDs at different locations and shielding depths. The TLDs {{were included in}} four experiments: A 0015 (a) Biostack, P 0004 Seeds in Space and P 0006 Linear Energy Transfer Spectrum Measurements at the trailing edge (west side) of the satellite; M 0004 Fiber Optics Data Link {{at the leading edge}} (east side); and A 0015 (b) Biostack at the Earth side. The shielding depths varied between 0. 48 and 15. 4 g/cm 2, Al equivalent. Both the directional dependence of trapped protons incident on the satellite and the shielding thickness were reflected in absorbed dose values. The trapped proton anisotropy was measured by TLDs at the east and west sides of LDEF. At the east side doses ranged from 2. 10 to 2. 58 Gy under shielding of 2. 90 to 1. 37 g/cm 2 (M 0004) while on the west side doses ranged from 2. 66 to 6. 48 Gy under shielding of 15. 4 to 0. 48 g/cm 2 (P 0006). The west side doses were more than a factor of two higher, where the vertical shielding thicknesses to space were equal. Other west side doses of 3. 04 to 4. 49 Gy under shielding of 11. 7 to 3. 85 g/cm 2 (A 0015 (a)) and 2. 91 to 6. 64 Gy under shielding of 11. 1 to 0. 48 g/cm 2 (P 0004) generally agreed with the P 0006 results. The Earth side doses of 2. 41 to 3. 93 Gy under shielding of 10. 0 to 1. 66 g cm 2 (A 0015 (b)) were intermediate between the east side and west side doses. Calculations utilizing a model of trapped proton spectra were performed by Watts et al. (1993) and comparisons of dose measurement and calculations may be found in a companion paper (Armstrong et al., 1996) ...|$|E
3000|$|... 177 Lutetium (177 Lu) is {{a useful}} {{radionuclide}} in several targeted peptide receptor radionuclide therapies (PRRTs) due to its favorable decay characteristics {{and the possibility of}} reliable labeling of biomolecules used for tumor targeting. Being both a beta and gamma emitter, the therapeutic effect achieved thanks to beta emission can be monitored by a gamma camera with planar or SPECT imaging. In order to maximize the treatment efficiency of [177 Lu]-DOTA-TATE [1 – 3], shown to be an effective therapy of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), the amount of 177 Lu radioactivity to be administered has to achieve an optimal therapeutic effect of radioligand therapy, i.e., to lead to a maximal absorbed dose in the tumors with limited side effects to the most radiosensitive non-pathological tissues, namely the kidneys and bone marrow [4 – 7]. For this purpose, individual dosimetry after each cycle of treatment is necessary to evaluate the <b>cumulative</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the organs at risk and to decide whether the patient can continue to receive further treatments. Recommended schedule of treatment with [177 Lu]-DOTA-TATE [8] consists of a fractionated therapy of four 7.4  GBq (200  mCi) injections spaced by 6 – 12  weeks, provided that the cumulative dose will not exceed the safety limits of 23  Gy [9 – 11] for the kidneys and 2  Gy [9, 12] for the bone marrow. It has previously been shown that in most cases, the kidneys are the dose-limiting organs in PRRT treatments with [177 Lu]-DOTA-TATE [9]. However, a recent study by Bergsma et al. [13] showed low nephrotoxicity after PRRT with a cumulative activity of 29.6  GBq (800  mCi) of [177 Lu]-DOTA-TATE and a mean calculated radiation dose to the kidneys of 20.1 [*]±[*] 4.9  Gy. Three of their 323 patients developed renal toxicity grade 2, and no grade 3 or 4 renal toxicity occurred. Other authors [7, 14] have argued that higher safe absorbed doses to the kidneys (28 – 29  Gy) could probably be adopted due to the inhomogeneous distribution at a microscopic level of PRRT with [177 Lu]-DOTA-TATE and to the short range of its β-particles in the tissue.|$|E
40|$|Radioembolisation (RE), with yttrium- 90 (90 Y) {{labelled}} microspheres, is {{an increasingly}} common treatment method for unresectable liver tumours. The tolerable mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> for normal liver (NL) tissue {{is higher in}} RE than in External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT); <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> heterogeneity {{is thought to be}} one important reason, together with a low <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> rate, but the knowledge of microsphere distributions is limited. The aim of this thesis was to describe macroscopic and small-scale heterogeneity in the distribution of microspheres and consequently in <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose,</b> and to create a hepatic branching artery tree model, able to reproduce normal liver microsphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distributions. Another aim was to develop and evaluate a method for prediction of <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the surgeon’s hands during liver resection on still radioactive tissues. Two patients with marginally resectable cholangiocarcinoma underwent resection, nine days after RE with resin SIR-Spheres®. Considering radiation safety, simulation of <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to surgeon’s hands was performed with the software Varskin Mod 2 ® before surgery and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> rate measurements were done with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) on resected tissue. The macroscopic sphere distribution within NL was investigated by gamma well chamber activity measurements on punch biopsies from sliced resected tissues and by calculating coefficient of variation (CV) and skewness (SK), in relation to biopsy mass. Small-scale heterogeneity in microsphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution was studied by light microscopy and subsequent <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> simulations by beta dose point kernel convolution. A branching artery tree model was used, to simulate microsphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distributions. Tissue measurements and simulations of <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to surgeon’s hands showed similar results. The CV and SK of activity concentration, by gamma well chamber measurements, decreased rapidly with increasing mass and/or mean activity concentration. Aggregations of clusters increased in frequency and CV and SK for <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distribution increased with mean sphere concentration. The branching artery tree model was able to resemble the biopsy sphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> distributions. Expected <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the surgeon’s hands was not alarming, but simulations and measurements of surgeon finger <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> are recommended. Decreasing CV and SK for macroscopic distribution indicated a heterogeneous pattern larger than the punch biopsy masses investigated. Small-scale sphere and <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> heterogeneity both increased with mean sphere concentration. The branching artery tree model helps to explain the distribution mechanism better than previous distribution models. The shown heterogeneity and the arterial tree model provide knowledge that may be helpful in optimising RE treatment, regarding number of injected spheres and activity per sphere...|$|R
30|$|In {{line with}} the expectation, the {{comparison}} of the <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> per activity between the lemon-juice and chewing-gum stimulation groups yielded, on average, a significantly lower value for the chewing-gum than for the lemon-juice stimulation group (Table  2 and Figure  4). The <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> per activity was approximately 30 % to 40 % lower when chewing tasteless gum. The above findings demonstrate that the increased blood flow {{appears to be a}} decisive factor causing the increased <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> in the lemon-juice stimulation group. However, {{no significant difference in the}} <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> per activity (P[*]≥[*] 0.60) was observed between the chewing-gum stimulation and non-stimulation groups (Figure  4); the percentage difference of the mean <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> was − 8 % for the submandibular gland and 5 % for the parotid gland. Contrary to the expectation, chewing-gum stimulation and non-stimulation yielded similar <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> per activity. Thus, the assumed washout effect was not large enough to alter significantly the <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> between the chewing-gum stimulation and non-stimulation groups.|$|R
