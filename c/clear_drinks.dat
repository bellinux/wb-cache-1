40|$|Complex fluids are {{the rule}} in biology and in many {{industrial}} applications. Typical examples are blood, cartilage, and polymer solutions. Unlike water (as well as domestic oils, soft <b>clear</b> <b>drinks,</b> and so on), the law(s) describing the behavior of complex fluids are not yet fully established. The complexity arises from strong coupling between microscopic scales (like the motion of a red blood cell {{in the case of}} blood, or a polymer molecule for a polymer solution) and the global scale of the flow (say at the scale of a blood artery, or a channel in laboratory experiments). In this issue entitled Complex and Biofluids a large panel of experimental and theoretical problems of complex fluids is exposed. The topics range from dilute polymer solutions, food products, to biology (blood flow, cell and tissue mechanics). One of the earliest model put forward as an attempt to describe a complex fluid was suggested a long time ago by James Clerk Maxwell (in 1867). Other famous scientists, like Einstein (in 1906), and Taylor (in 1932) have made important contributions to the field, but the topic of complex fluids still continues to pose a formidable challenge to science. This field has known during the past decade an unbelievable upsurge of interest in many branches of science (physics, mechanics, chemistry, biology, medical science, mathematics, and so on). Understanding complex fluids is viewed as one of the biggest challenge of the present century. This synthesis will provide a simple introduction to the topic, summarize the main contribution of this issue, and list major open questions in this field. To cite this article: C. Misbah, C. R.

40|$|Milk {{proteins}} can be hydrolysed (i. e. fragmented) using proteolytic enzymes to give enhanced {{functional and}} nutritional properties. There {{is an increasing}} demand for hydrolysed protein ingredients with specific properties for nutrition of individuals with specialised dietary requirements including infants, the critically ill, the immuno-compromised and athletes. Such hydrolysed proteins can be specifically designed to provide distinctive tailor-made solutions to meet customer needs in these areas. This project explored the technologies {{for the production of}} two types of hydrolysates i. e. acid-soluble and glutamine-rich. Acid-soluble protein hydrolysates have potential in the fortification of acidic beverages, including soft drinks. Glutamine-rich hydrolysates are suggested as an optimal glutamine source for administration during periods of stress, such as recovery from strenuous exercise, or from surgery. Casein was selected as the protein for development of acid-soluble product and cereal protein for the glutamine-rich product. The main conclusions were as follows: A number of protein hydrolysate products with value added properties and the processes required for their manufacture have been developed and are available for uptake by the food industry. Laboratory investigations identified conditions for the generation of two casein hydrolysates with desirable functional properties. Scale-up conditions for the manufacture of these hydrolysates in the pilot plant were successfully developed. Both hydrolystates were 100 % soluble at pH 4. 6, exhibited clarity in solution at low pH in <b>clear</b> soft <b>drinks</b> and in caramelised beverages and were stable in solution over a wide temperature range (from 4 to 30 ºC) for extended periods. Solutions containing these hydrolysates exhibited no foaming properties and had acceptable sensory properties, being considered as weakly bitter compared to unsupplemented solutions. These performance characteristics make the acid-soluble hydrolysates useful supplements for caramelised beverages, such as colas, and <b>clear</b> soft <b>drinks.</b> Six glutamine-enriched peptide products were produced at laboratory scale using two commercially available enzyme preparations. These products had desirable characteristics such as increased levels of peptide bound glutamine, low free amino acid and free pyroglutamate levels. Pilot plant processes were developed for manufacture of the two glutamine-rich hydrolysates with most suitable compositional properties and these were fully characterised chemically. The manufacturing process was modified to enable industrial scale batches (5, 000 litres) to be produced. End of Project ReportDepartment of Agriculture, Food and the Marin...|$|R

A questionnaire assessing the clarity and accuracy of fasting instructions and patient hydration was employed to survey patients undergoing elective anaesthesia or sedation in July 2013 (first cycle) and September 2013 (second cycle). The fasting instruction policy and patient information leaflet were reviewed; they state “nothing to eat or drink from midnight ” for morning surgery and “nothing to eat or drink from 7 AM” for afternoon surgery.

40|$|Optimal {{perioperative}} fluid {{management is}} an important component of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathways. Fluid management within ERAS should be viewed as a continuum through the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases. Each phase is important for improving patient outcomes, and suboptimal care in one phase can undermine best practice within the rest of the ERAS pathway. The goal of preoperative fluid management is for the patient to arrive in the operating room in a hydrated and euvolemic state. To achieve this, prolonged fasting is not recommended, and routine mechanical bowel preparation should be avoided. Patients should be encouraged to ingest a <b>clear</b> carbohydrate <b>drink</b> two to three hours before surgery. The goals of intraoperative fluid management are to maintain central euvolemia and to avoid excess salt and water. To achieve this, patients undergoing surgery within an enhanced recovery protocol should have an individualized fluid management plan. As part of this plan, excess crystalloid should be avoided in all patients. For low-risk patients undergoing low-risk surgery, a "zero-balance" approach might be sufficient. In addition, for most patients undergoing major surgery, individualized goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) is recommended. Ultimately, however, the additional benefit of GDFT should be determined based on surgical and patient risk factors. Postoperatively, once fluid intake is established, intravenous fluid administration can be discontinued and restarted only if clinically indicated. In the absence of other concerns, detrimental postoperative fluid overload is not justified and "permissive oliguria" could be tolerated...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{metabolic}} and cellular effects of carbohydrate-based preconditioning drinks in humans. Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} that preoperative carbohydrate loading, as opposed to overnight fasting, attenuated the development of postoperative insulin resistance by up to 50 % and led to clinical benefits. Preconditioning with carbohydrate-based drinks was incorporated into enhanced recovery after surgery programs. The latter included interventions that aimed to minimise ‘metabolic-stress’ and hasten recovery after major surgery. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of preoperative fasting and the beneficial effects of preconditioning with carbohydrate-based drinks were hitherto unknown. In healthy volunteers, short-term fasting (up to 24 hours) reduced liver volume, depleted liver glycogen (- 50 %) and lipid reserves, and increased intramyocellular lipid concentrations (+ 23 %), as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Changes in liver glycogen were partially reversed following ingestion of a carbohydrate-based drink that also contained glutamine and antioxidants (ONS, Fresenius Kabi, Germany). Fasting also led to significantly decreased blood mononuclear cell mitochondrial complex activity. In patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, preoperative conditioning with ONS, compared to ingestion of a placebo-drink, significantly increased intraoperative liver glycogen by 50 %, increased intraoperative plasma glutamine and antioxidant concentrations, led to lower expression of skeletal muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 mRNA and protein expression, and finally, reduced cellular oxidative stress, as indicated by a 1. 5 -fold lower expression of metallothionein- 1 A in the ONS group. Ingestion of ONS led to markedly differing hormonal and metabolic responses compared to those following a <b>clear</b> carbohydrate <b>drink</b> (preOp®, Nutricia Clinical Care, UK), with ‘blunted’ postprandial glucose and insulin responses following ONS. Supplementing preOp® with glutamine ‘blunted’ postprandial insulin and glucose responses but this was not due to differences in glucagon-like peptide- 1 concentrations.
