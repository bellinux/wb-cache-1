5|$|Grandmaster Flash {{suggests}} that Herc {{may not have}} kept pace with developments in techniques of <b>cueing</b> (lining up a record to play at a certain place on it). Developments changed techniques of cutting (switching from one record to another) and scratching (moving the record by hand to and fro under the stylus for percussive effect) in the late 1970s. Herc said he retreated from the scene after being stabbed at the Executive Playhouse while trying to intercede in a fight, and the burning down {{of one of his}} venues. In 1980, Herc had stopped DJing and was working in a record shop in South Bronx.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Australian {{designed}} and built eight-seat GippsAero GA8 Airvan {{was added to the}} corporate fleet. Sixteen of the Civil Air Patrol's fleet of 18 Airvans carry the Airborne Real-time <b>Cueing</b> Hyperspectral Enhanced Reconnaissance (ARCHER) system, which can be used to search for aircraft wreckage based on its spectral signature. Other aircraft types include the Cessna 206 and the Maule MT-235. CAP also has a number of gliders, such as the LET L-23 Super Blaník, the Schleicher ASK 21 and the Schweizer SGS 2-33, used mainly for cadet orientation flights.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cue</b> is some {{organization}} of the data present in the signal which allows for meaningful extrapolation. For example, Sensory <b>cues</b> include Visual <b>cues,</b> auditory <b>cues,</b> haptic <b>cues,</b> olfactory <b>cues,</b> environmental <b>cues,</b> and so on. Sensory <b>cues</b> are a fundamental part of theories of perception, especially theories of appearance (how things look).|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} was to provide further evidence regarding the role of remember <b>cues</b> on pigeon short-term memory. The first two experiments were conducted to determine whether, using a single <b>cuing</b> procedure, control over delayed matching-to-sample (DMTS) performance could be demonstrated by establishing a no <b>cue</b> condition as an implicit <b>cue</b> to forget. In Experiment 1, subjects were provided with training in a procedure where both forget <b>cue</b> (F) and no <b>cues</b> indicated the omission of the comparison stimuli {{at the end of}} the delay interval. In Experiment 2, naive subjects were trained with remember (R) and F trials <b>cued</b> from the outset. In both experiments the <b>cuing</b> effect was evaluated with R, F, and no <b>cue</b> probe trials where the <b>cues</b> were presented in the beginning, middle, or end of a 3 sec delay interval. The results revealed that DMTS accuracy on F <b>cued</b> probe trials was significantly lower than that on R <b>cued</b> or no <b>cue</b> probe trials. Performance on R <b>cued</b> and no <b>cue</b> probe trials was statistically equivalent despite both the explicit training of the no <b>cue</b> condition to function as an implicit <b>cue</b> to forget (Experiment 1), and <b>cuing</b> R and F trials from the outset and presenting the no <b>cue</b> trials only during probe testing (Experiment 2). The main {{aim of the}} third experiment was to determine whether the attenuating effect of an R <b>cue</b> over a previously presented F <b>cue</b> was the result of conditioning history. The <b>cuing</b> effect was evaluated in three types of single <b>cued</b> trials (R, F, and no <b>cue),</b> and two types of double <b>cued</b> trials (forget-remember, FR, and forget-novel, FN). The results indicated identical performance in FR and FN <b>cued</b> probe trials, suggesting that the novelty of presenting two <b>cues</b> in the retention interval may play a role in determining DMTS performance in double <b>cued</b> probe trials. Performance on double <b>cued</b> and no <b>cue</b> probe trials did not significantly differ from R or F <b>cued</b> probe trials. The evidence is contrary to the hypothesis that, as a result of previous training, a no <b>cue</b> functions as an implicit remember <b>cue...</b>|$|R
40|$|Various visual <b>cues</b> provide {{information}} about depth and shape in a scene. In this paper, research on depth <b>cue</b> combination is reviewed. Using normative considerations, we have developed the "Modified Weak Fusion" (MWF) model of <b>cue</b> combination. This model includes a simple, linear <b>cue</b> combination rule (weighted averaging of depth estimates). But, it also raises three key issues for depth <b>cue</b> combination in human vision that lead to apparent nonlinearities and interactions between cues: (1) <b>cue</b> promotion (most <b>cues</b> must be scaled and disambiguated before averaging is a meaningful operation), (2) dynamic weighting of <b>cues</b> (a <b>cue's</b> weight depends on scene content, including the weight of other <b>cues),</b> and (3) robustness of <b>cue</b> combination (a <b>cue's</b> weight may change with the degree of discrepancy of the estimate of depth derived using that <b>cue</b> relative to the estimates from other <b>cues</b> present in the scene).

5|$|The Civil Air Patrol also {{provides}} non-emergency {{assistance to the}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Drug Enforcement Administration, and United States Forest Service in the War on Drugs. In 2005, CAP flew over 12,000hours {{in support of this}} mission and led these agencies to the confiscation of illegal substances valued at over US$400million. Civil Air Patrol makes extensive use of the Airborne Real-time <b>Cueing</b> Hyperspectral Enhanced Reconnaissance system, mounted on the Gippsland GA8 Airvan. The system is able to evaluate spectral signatures given off by certain objects, allowing the system to identify, for example, a possible marijuana crop.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the USMC was {{studying}} potential enhancements {{to keep the}} AV-8B Harrier IIs up to date until its planned retirement, such as a helmet-mounted <b>cueing</b> system. It is also predicted that additional work on the aircraft's radars and sensor systems may take place. The USMC's Harrier II fleet was planned to remain in service until 2030, owing to delays with the F-35B {{and the fact that}} the Harriers have more service life left than USMC F/A-18 Hornets. However, by 2014 the USMC had decided to retire the AV-8B sooner because changing the transition orders of Harrier II and Hornet fleets to the Lightning II would save $1billion. After entering service in the mid-2010s, the F-35B will start to replace the AV-8B in 2016, with the AV-8B expected to continue service until 2025. Meanwhile, the AV-8B will receive revamped defensive measures, updated data-link capability and targeting sensors, and improved missiles and rockets, among other enhancements.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNeurologically normal {{subjects}} misperceive the midpoints {{of lines}} (PSE) as reliably leftward of veridical center, a {{phenomenon known as}} pseudoneglect. This leftward bias reflects {{the dominance of the}} right cerebral hemisphere in deploying spatial attention. Transient visual <b>cues,</b> delivered to either the left or right endpoints of lines, modulate PSE such that leftward biases are increased by leftward <b>cues,</b> and are decreased by rightward <b>cues,</b> relative to a no-cue control condition. We ask whether lateralized auditory <b>cues</b> can similarly influence PSE in a tachistoscopic visual line bisection task, and describe how visual and auditory <b>cues,</b> in spatially synergistic or antagonistic combinations, jointly influence PSE. Our results demonstrate that whereas auditory and visual <b>cues</b> both modulate PSE, visual <b>cues</b> are overall more potent than auditory <b>cues.</b> Visual and auditory <b>cues</b> are weighted such that visual <b>cues</b> are significantly more potent than auditory <b>cues</b> when visual <b>cues</b> are delivered to left hemispace. Visual and auditory <b>cues</b> are equipotent when visual <b>cues</b> are delivered to right hemispace. These results are consistent with the existence of independent lateralized networks governing the deployment of visuospatial and audiospatial attention.

40|$|An {{important}} empirical {{and theoretical}} {{issue in the}} study of learning is the manner in which one’s learning about one <b>cue</b> affects learning about another <b>cue.</b> In most cases, one’s learning about one <b>cue</b> competes with learning about other <b>cues</b> (i. e., overshadowing or blocking), and these <b>cue</b> competition effects have inspired and guided some of the most influential ideas about the mechanisms of learning (see, e. g., Rescorla & Wagner, 1972). In other cases, the presence of one <b>cue</b> can facilitate learning about a second <b>cue.</b> For example, taste <b>cues</b> have been found to facilitate learning about odor <b>cues</b> in food aversion learning (e. g., Rusiniak, Palmerino, Rice, Forthman, & Garcia, 1982).

40|$|Navigation is {{influenced}} by body-based self-motion <b>cues</b> that are integrated over time in {{a process known as}} path integration, and also by environmental <b>cues</b> such as landmarks and room shape. This project explored whether humans combine path integration and room shape <b>cues</b> when returning to a previously visited location and connects human <b>cue</b> integration research to animal <b>cue</b> competition research. Participants walked an outbound path in an immersive virtual environment before attempting to return to the path origin. Path integration and an environmental <b>cue</b> were both available during the outbound path, but experimental manipulations created single- and dual-cue conditions during the return path. Response variance when returning to the path origin was reduced when both <b>cues</b> were available. These findings indicate that humans integrate multiple spatial <b>cues</b> during navigation.
