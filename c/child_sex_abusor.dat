40|$|Sexual {{offending}} {{against children}} is a highly emotive issue. It is nonetheless important that public policy initiatives to prevent and/or respond to child sexual abuse {{are based on the}} available evidence about <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> offenders. This paper addresses five common misperceptions about the perpetrators of sexual offences against children. Specifically, the issues addressed include whether all <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> offenders are ‘paedophiles’, who sexually abuse children, whether most <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> offenders were victims of sexual abuse themselves, rates of recidivism among <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> offenders and the number of <b>children</b> <b>sex</b> offenders typically abuse before they are detected by police. The evidence outlined in this paper highlights that there are few black and white answers to these questions. Perpetrators of sexual crimes against children are not, contrary to widespread opinion, a homogenous group. Rather, {{there are a number of}} varied offending profiles that characterise <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> offenders. Gaining an understanding of the nuances of this offender population is critical if children are to be protected from sexual abuse...|$|R

Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in Asia and <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> industry is a growing business in Cambodia. Cambodia is well-known as one of the destinations for <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> tourist from Asia and Western countries. Cambodia’s popularity as a <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> tourism destination can be linked by several factors such as, historical, cultural, poverty, corruption and weak law enforcement factors. Although prohibited by law, the <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> industry is still rampant across Cambodia, especially in tourist attractions. To address this issue, Cambodia government take actions by cooperating with ECPAT, which is a non-governmental organization whose focus is to eliminate Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. However, the number of trafficked children to fulfill demand of sex tourism industry are still growing. This problem will be analyzed by using liberalism perspective, concept of international organization and organizational performance. The research method is descriptive which used to describing the <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> trafficking issues which is aimed to fulfill demand of Cambodia’s sex tourism industry. The result of this research shows that <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> trafficking in Cambodia is still growing despite the efforts of Cambodian Government and ECPAT, because of external factors that hinder ECPAT’s performance, which is the growing corruption in Cambodia. It causes ECPAT’s efforts to combat <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> trafficking in Cambodia cannot work effectively...|$|R

40|$|<b>Child</b> <b>sex</b> {{tourism is}} tourism {{organised}} {{with the primary}} purpose of facilitating a commercial sexual relationship with a child. It involves a segment of the local <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> industry that is directly connected to both an international and domestic tourist market. The increase of tourism has brought with it complications in that tourism is being used as a means for sex tourists to initiate contact with children. Aside from <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> tourists who are paedophiles, there are those who engage in the opportunistic exploitation of children while travelling on business or for other reasons. There are a number of social and economic factors leading to <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> tourism and the effect is that child victims are exposed to immediate harm, irreversible damage and even death. As South Africa's tourism industry expands into one of the country’s top earners of foreign currency, it is unfortunate to note that its <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> tourist trade is also on the increase. Reports show that sex tours are as easily organised as wine route tours in Cape Town. Commercial sexual exploitation of children is prevalent in South Africa and has become more organised in recent years. A comprehensive response to the problem is essential to ensure that South Africa does not become a “safe haven” for <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> tourists. Effective laws at home and the extraterritorial application of these laws to prosecute South African nationals for crimes committed abroad are imperative. Significant steps are being taken both nationally and internationally to target <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> tourism. South Africa has ratified several international instruments on children’s rights, trafficking in persons, child labour, and discrimination against women and young girls, all of which relate to <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> tourism. In doing so, South Africa has made an international commitment to uphold the provisions of these instruments and give effect to them. South Africa is therefore under an international obligation to create the necessary structures and apply mechanisms and resources to combat <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> tourism...|$|R

Chapters 1 and 2 evaluate sexual interest in <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> offenders, exploring the attentional blink theories. Chapter 3 examines RSVP in <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> offenders and offenders with no sexual offence history, showing <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> offenders displaying enhanced attentional blink towards images of children. Chapter 4 examined released <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> offenders who did not show the hypothesised attentional blink effect. Chapter 5 looked into RSVP responses of fathers with children under two, and shows an opposite pattern of response to <b>child</b> <b>sex</b> offenders. Chapter 6 showed that RSVP, using male and female images, elicited heightened attentional blink in a normative sample of females, but not the male sample. Chapter 7 examined the RSVP using erotic images of males and females on heterosexual males and females with no significant effect. Chapter 8 tested {{the reliability and validity of}} the RSVP in a subsample using the procedure on two separate occasions, showing significant improvement from Session 1 to Session 2. This shows practice effect can influence performance on the RSVP. The main discussion evaluates the results in terms of implications for the utility of the RSVP.
