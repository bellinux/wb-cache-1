40|$|Reasons for {{describing}} cosmic hydromagnetic phenomena by introducing electric currents are summarized demonstrating that {{change from the}} traditional magnetic field description to a current description provides new aspects of <b>cosmic</b> <b>electrodynamics.</b> It is shown that the kink-instability of electric currents is the basic physical phenomenon responsible for magnetic flux generation in cosmic physics. A model which starts with a poloidal magnetic field is discussed; differential motions change the field configuration so that kinetic energy is transferred into magnetic energy of induced toroidal fields; the currents associated with these become unstable when the toroidal energy exceeds the poloidal energy resulting in an amplification of the original poloidal field...|$|E
40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the fluid theory has been {{successful}} in magnetospheric problems (such as the shape of the magnetopause) which involve basic considerations such as the conservation of particles, of momentum, and of energy, but that it is inadequate for other problems (such as the energization of auroral particles). Difficulties arise {{from the fact that it}} is not always possible to specify 'a volume of plasma' because particles do not remain as neighbors. Misuse of the fluid theory has led to a number of fallacies, such as the idea that the causal order of physical events in <b>cosmic</b> <b>electrodynamics</b> is the reverse of that in the familiar laboratory electrodynamics. This mistaken idea comes from a confusion of a mathematical sequence of calculations with the causal order. A plea is made for a common sense approach to magnetospheric and auroral problems wherein the fluid theory is used whenever it can, but where it is not expected to be adequate for all occasions...|$|E
40|$|In 1967, at the Birkeland Symposium in Sandefjord, Norway, Professor Hannes Alfvén {{stated that}} the second {{approach}} (in solving unsolved problems by the standard MHD theory) to <b>cosmic</b> <b>electrodynamics</b> is to "thaw" the "frozen-in" magnetic field lines. "We can illustrate essential properties of the electromagnetic state of space either by depicting the magnetic field lines or by depicting electric current lines," he said. There has been much progress in space physics since the Birkeland Symposium more than 40 years ago, but unfortunately our scientific community has not really succeeded in thawing the frozen-in field lines. Instead, it has pursued magnetic reconnection, a concept that Alfvén had been critical of. It is shown here {{that we have to}} study many unsolved problems and problems thought to be solved in terms of both the magnetic field line concept and the current system concept. In taking Alfvén's approach, we must consider the whole system, including the power supply (dynamo process) and its transmission and distribution (electric currents) and observed phenomena (power dissipation processes). Such a consideration can provide physical insight into many of our unsolved problems and problems thought to be solved. In this paper, we consider substorm onset processes, the substorm current system, sunspots, solar flares, coronal mass ejections, the interplanetary current sheet, and the magnetic field configuration of the heliosphere in terms of the current system concept. In particular, it is shown that a study of the current system is essential in substorm studies, more than changes of the magnetic field configuration in the magnetotail...|$|E
5000|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} ingredient he brought to his teaching was his exquisite taste. He always knew what were the important problems, as shown by his choice of subjects. He truly lived with those problems, struggling for a solution, and he communicated his concern to the group. In its heyday, there were about eight or ten graduate students in his group and about six Post-doctoral Fellows. He met this group once a day in his office, and discussed with one after another {{the status of the}} student's research problem. He was interested in everything, and in one afternoon they might discuss quantum <b>electrodynamics,</b> <b>cosmic</b> rays, electron pair production and nuclear physics.|$|R
5000|$|... {{was born}} in 1924 in Tiflis (now - Tbilisi, Georgia) {{in a family of}} a Medical Doctor and a homemaker. Eventually the family moved to Baku (Azerbaijan) where Garibian got his general education. In 1943 he {{graduated}} from school in Baku and went to Moscow. Physical science was Garibian's passion in life. Even {{at a very young age}} he followed news in the world of physics and was very excited when in 1942 he learned about the Alikhanian brothers’ expedition to Mount Aragats (Armenia) in order to search for protons in cosmic rays. Garibian was accepted into the Department of Physics and Mathematics of Moscow State University which he graduated from in 1948 immediately to leave for Yerevan and join the Yerevan Physics Institute, which was founded by Artyom Alikhanian in 1943.After that time Garibian dedicated himself to scientific research in Theoretical physics, in the fields of Quantum <b>electrodynamics,</b> <b>Cosmic</b> rays, and High energy particles.|$|R
