50|$|Wiggle matching, {{also known}} as carbon - 14 wiggle-match dating (WMD) is a dating method that uses the {{non-linear}} relationship between 14C age and calendar age to match {{the shape of a}} series of closely sequentially spaced 14C dates with the 14C calibration curve. A numerical approach to WMD allows one to assess the precision of WMD chronologies. The method has both advantages and limitations vis-a-vis the calibration of individual dates. High-precision chronologies are needed for studies of rapid climate changes. Alan Millard refers to wiggle matching as a way of dealing with the flat portion of the carbon 14 <b>calibration</b> <b>graph</b> which is known as the Hallstatt plateau, named after the Hallstatt culture period in central Europe with which it coincides.|$|E
50|$|Suppose {{that the}} {{concentration}} of silver in samples of photographic waste is {{to be determined by}} atomic-absorption spectrometry. Using the calibration curve method, an analyst could calibrate the spectrometer with some aqueous solutions of a pure silver salt and use the resulting <b>calibration</b> <b>graph</b> in the determination of the silver in the test samples. This method is only valid, however, if a pure aqueous solution of silver, and a photographic waste sample containing the same concentration of silver, give the same absorbance values. In other words, in using pure solutions to establish the <b>calibration</b> <b>graph</b> it is assumed that there are no ‘matrix effects’, i.e. no reduction or enhancement of the silver absorbance signal by other components. In many areas of analysis such an assumption is frequently invalid. Matrix effects occur even with methods such as plasma spectrometry, which have a reputation for being relatively free from interferences.The method of standard additions is usually followed to eliminate matrix effects. Experimentally, equal volumes of the sample solution are taken, all but one are separately ‘spiked’ with known and different amounts of the analyte, and all are then diluted to the same volume. The instrument signals are then determined for all these solutions and the results plotted. As usual, the signal is plotted on the y-axis; in this case the x-axis is graduated in terms of the amounts of analyte added (either as an absolute weight or as a concentration). The (unweighted) regression line is calculated in the normal way, but space is provided for it to be extrapolated to the point on thex-axis at which y = 0. This negative intercept on the x-axis corresponds to the amount of the analyte in the test sample. This value is given by a/b, the ratio of the intercept and the slope of the regression line.Similarly in gas chromatography the following procedure is used: 1) The chromatogram of the unknown is recorded 2) a known amount of the analyte(s) of interest is added 3) the sample is analyzed again under the same conditions and the chromatogram is recorded. From the increase in the peak area (or peak height), the original concentration can be computed by extrapolation. The detector response must be a linear function of analyte concentration and yield no signal (other than background) at zero concentration of the analyte.|$|E
50|$|When a {{continuum}} radiation source {{is used for}} AAS measurement it is indispensable {{to work with a}} high-resolution monochromator. The resolution has to be equal to or better than the half width of an atomic absorption line (about 2 pm) in order to avoid losses of sensitivity and linearity of the <b>calibration</b> <b>graph.</b> The research with high-resolution (HR) CS AAS was pioneered by the groups of O’Haver and Harnly in the USA, who also developed the (up until now) only simultaneous multi-element spectrometer for this technique. The break-through, however, came when the group of Becker-Ross in Berlin, Germany, built a spectrometer entirely designed for HR-CS AAS. The first commercial equipment for HR-CS AAS was introduced by Analytik Jena (Jena, Germany) {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century, based on the design proposed by Becker-Ross and Florek. These spectrometers use a compact double monochromator with a prism pre-monochromator and an echelle grating monochromator for high resolution. A linear charge coupled device (CCD) array with 200 pixels is used as the detector. The second monochromator does not have an exit slit; hence the spectral environment at both sides of the analytical line becomes visible at high resolution. As typically only 3-5 pixels are used to measure the atomic absorption, the other pixels are available for correction purposes. One of these corrections is that for lamp flicker noise, which is independent of wavelength, resulting in measurements with very low noise level; other corrections are those for background absorption, as will be discussed later.|$|E
