5|$|Zoo or {{laboratory}} rearing and isolation are important factors leading to increased susceptibility to self-harm in higher mammals, e.g., macaque monkeys. Non-primate mammals are also known to mutilate themselves under laboratory conditions after administration of drugs. For example, pemoline, <b>clonidine,</b> amphetamine, and very high (toxic) doses of caffeine or theophylline {{are known to}} precipitate self-harm in lab animals.|$|E
5|$|Medication is {{available}} to help when symptoms interfere with functioning. The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), pimozide (Orap) and fluphenazine (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term adverse effects. The antihypertensive agents <b>clonidine</b> (trade name Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. Stimulants and other medications {{may be useful in}} treating ADHD when it co-occurs with tic disorders. Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including guanfacine (trade name Tenex), atomoxetine (Strattera) and tricyclic antidepressants. Clomipramine (Anafranil), a tricyclic, and SSRIs—a class of antidepressants including fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and fluvoxamine (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.|$|E
25|$|Gabapentin or <b>clonidine</b> {{may help}} {{but does not}} {{work as well as}} hormone therapy. <b>Clonidine</b> may be {{associated}} with constipation and sleeping problems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonidine</b> {{and other}} {{imidazoline}} compounds {{have also been}} shown to reduce muscle spasms by their central nervous system activity. Tizanidine is perhaps the most thoroughly studied <b>clonidine</b> analog, and is an agonist at α2-adrenergic receptors, but reduces spasticity at doses that result in significantly less hypotension than <b>clonidine.</b> Neurophysiologic studies show that it depresses excitatory feedback from muscles that would normally increase muscle tone, therefore minimizing spasticity. Furthermore, several clinical trials indicate that tizanidine has a similar efficacy to other spasmolytic agents, such as diazepam and baclofen, with a different spectrum of adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|An α2A {{adrenergic}} receptor agonist {{has also been}} approved in the US. <b>Clonidine</b> was initially developed {{as a treatment for}} high blood pressure. Low doses in evenings and/or afternoons are sometimes used in conjunction with stimulants to help with sleep and because <b>clonidine</b> sometimes helps moderate impulsive and oppositional behavior and may reduce tics. It may be more useful for comorbid Tourette syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{adverse effects}} of <b>clonidine</b> are sedation, dry mouth, and hypotension (low blood pressure).|$|E
25|$|Unlike α2 {{adrenoceptor}} agonists such as guanfacine and <b>clonidine,</b> atomoxetine's use can be abruptly stopped {{without significant}} discontinuation effects being seen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonidine</b> is classed by the FDA as {{pregnancy}} category C. It {{is classified}} by the TGA of Australia as pregnancy category B3, {{which means that}} it has shown some detrimental effects on fetal development in animal studies, although the relevance of this to human beings is unknown. <b>Clonidine</b> can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby; caution is warranted in women who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.|$|E
25|$|Other {{ineffective}} treatments include leukocyte elastase protease inhibitors, the EIPH Patch, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, pentoxyfylline, guanabenz, <b>clonidine,</b> snake venom, and enalapril.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonidine</b> {{suppresses}} sympathetic outflow {{resulting in}} lower blood pressure, but sudden discontinuation can cause rebound hypertension {{due to a}} rebound in sympathetic outflow.|$|E
25|$|Other psychotropic {{analgesic}} agents include ketamine (an NMDA receptor antagonist), <b>clonidine</b> {{and other}} α2-adrenoreceptor agonists, and mexiletine {{and other local}} anaesthetic analogues.|$|E
25|$|A {{case report}} {{published}} in 2000 noted an {{instance in which}} mirtazapine counteracted the action of <b>clonidine,</b> causing a dangerous rise in blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonidine</b> {{may be used}} in {{combination}} with benzodiazepines to help some of the symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of baclofen for alcohol withdrawal syndrome.|$|E
25|$|A {{case report}} {{described}} mirtazapine as inducing hypertension in a clonidine-treated patient, {{likely due to}} occupancy of α2-adrenergic receptors by mirtazapine limiting the efficacy of concurrent <b>clonidine</b> therapy.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} neurons of the {{sympathetic}} nervous system (SNS), which release noradrenaline, which, besides affecting postsynaptic receptors, also affects presynaptic α2-adrenergic receptors, inhibiting further release of noradrenaline. This effect is utilized with <b>clonidine</b> to perform inhibitory effects on the SNS.|$|E
25|$|Stimulants are {{the most}} {{effective}} medications available {{for the treatment of}} ADHD. Seven different formulations of stimulants have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ADHD: four amphetamine-based formulations, two methylphenidate-based formulations, and dextromethamphetamine hydrochloride. Atomoxetine, guanfacine and <b>clonidine</b> are the only non-controlled, non-stimulant FDA approved drugs for the treatment of ADHD.|$|E
25|$|Many {{drugs have}} been found that lessen the risk of {{neurotoxicity}} from NMDA receptor antagonists. Centrally acting alpha 2 agonists such as <b>clonidine</b> and guanfacine are thought to most directly target the etiology of NMDA neurotoxicity. Other drugs acting on various neurotransmitter systems known to inhibit NMDA antagonist neurotoxicity include: anticholinergics, diazepam, barbiturates, ethanol, 5-HT2A serotonin receptor agonists, and muscimol.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clonidine</b> {{may be used}} to ease {{withdrawal}} symptoms associated with the long-term use of narcotics, alcohol, benzodiazepines and nicotine (smoking). It can alleviate opioid {{withdrawal symptoms}} by reducing the sympathetic nervous system response such as tachycardia and hypertension, as well as reducing sweating, hot and cold flashes, and general restlessness. It may also be helpful in aiding smokers to quit. The sedation effect is also useful. However, its side effects can include insomnia, thus exacerbating an already common feature of opioid withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{dose range}} for {{induction}} of anesthesia using thiopental is from 3 to 6mg/kg; however, {{there are many}} factors that can alter this. Premedication with sedatives such as benzodiazepines or <b>clonidine</b> will reduce requirements, as do specific disease states and other patient factors. Among patient factors are: age, sex, and lean body mass. Specific disease conditions that can alter the dose requirements of thiopentone {{and for that matter}} any other intravenous anaesthetic are: hypovolemia, burns, azotemia, hepatic failure, hypoproteinemia, etc.|$|E
25|$|Chlorpromazine {{may also}} {{interact}} with epinephrine (adrenaline) {{to produce a}} paradoxical fall in blood pressure. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and thiazide diuretics may also accentuate the orthostatic hypotension experienced by those receiving chlorpromazine treatment. Quinidine may interact with chlorpromazine to increase myocardialdepression. Likewise it may also antagonize the effects of <b>clonidine</b> and guanethidine. It also may reduce the seizure threshold and hence a corresponding titration of anticonvulsant treatments should be considered. Prochlorperazine and desferrioxamine may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce transient metabolic encephalopathy.|$|E
25|$|Alarm pheromone-induced {{anxiety in}} rats {{has been used}} to {{evaluate}} the degree to which anxiolytics can alleviate anxiety in humans. For this the change in the acoustic startle reflex of rats with alarm pheromone-induced anxiety (i.e. reduction of defensiveness) has been measured. Pretreatment of rats with one of five anxiolytics used in clinical medicine was able to reduce their anxiety: namely midazolam, phenelzine (a nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor), propranolol, a nonselective beta blocker, <b>clonidine,</b> an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist or CP-154,526, a corticotropin-releasing hormone antagonist.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} for mild cases is simply reassurance and topical treatment with calcium-channel blocker (diltiazem, nifedipine) ointment, salbutamol inhalation and sublingual nitroglycerine.For persistent cases, local anesthetic blocks, <b>clonidine</b> or Botox injections can be considered. Supportive treatments directed at aggravating factors include high-fiber diet, withdrawal of drugs which have gut effects (e.g., drugs that provoke or worsen constipation including narcotics and oral calcium channel blockers; drugs that provoke or worsen diarrhea including quinidine, theophylline, and antibiotics), warm baths, rectal massage, perineal strengthening exercises, anti-cholinergic agents, non-narcotic analgesics, sedatives or muscle relaxants such as diazepam.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{stimulant}} and non-stimulant medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD. The most commonly used stimulant medications include methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta), mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse). Non-stimulant medications with a specific indication for ADHD include atomoxetine (Strattera), guanfacine (Intuniv), and <b>clonidine</b> (Kapvay). Other medicines which may be prescribed off-label include bupropion (Wellbutrin), tricyclic antidepressants, SNRIs, or MAOIs. The presence of comorbid (co-occurring) disorders can make finding the right treatment and diagnosis much more complicated, costly, and time-consuming. So it is recommended to assess and simultaneously treat any comorbid disorders.|$|E
25|$|The stimulants are {{the first}} line of {{treatment}} for ADHD, with proven efficacy, but they do fail in up to 20% of cases, even in patients without tic disorders. Current prescribed stimulant medications include: methylphenidate (brand names Ritalin, Metadate, Concerta), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall). Other medications can be used when stimulants are not an option. These include the alpha-2 agonists (<b>clonidine</b> and guanfacine), tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine and nortriptyline), and newer antidepressants (bupropion and venlafaxine). There have been case reports of tics worsening with bupropion (brand name Wellbutrin). There is good empirical evidence for short-term safety and efficacy for the use of desipramine, bupropion and atomoxetine (Strattera).|$|E
25|$|The {{withdrawal}} symptoms for opiates may include severe dysphoria, craving for another opiate dose, irritability, sweating, nausea, rhinorrea, tremor, vomiting and myalgia. Slowly reducing the intake of opioids over {{days and weeks}} can reduce or eliminate the {{withdrawal symptoms}}. The speed and severity of withdrawal depends on the half-life of the opioid; heroin and morphine withdrawal occur more quickly and are more severe than methadone withdrawal. The acute withdrawal phase is often followed by a protracted phase of depression and insomnia that can last for months. The symptoms of opioid withdrawal can be treated with other medications, such as <b>clonidine.</b> Physical dependence does not predict drug misuse or true addiction, and {{is closely related to}} the same mechanism as tolerance. While there is anecdotal claims of benefit with ibogaine, data to support its use in substance dependence is poor.|$|E
25|$|Local anesthetics {{are broken}} down into 2 categories: ester-linked and amide-linked drugs. The esters include benzocaine, procaine, tetracaine, and chloroprocaine. The amides include {{lidocaine}}, mepivacaine, prilocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, and levobupivacaine. Chloroprocaine is a short-acting drug (45–90 minutes), lidocaine and mepivacaine are intermediate duration (90–180 minutes), and bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivacaine are long-acting (4–18 hours). Drugs commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks include lidocaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine, and mepivacaine. These drugs are often combined with adjuvants (additives) with the end goal of increasing {{the duration of the}} analgesia or shortening time of onset. Additives may include epinephrine, <b>clonidine,</b> and dexmedetomidine. Vasoconstriction caused by local anesthetic may be further enhanced synergistically with the addition of epinephrine, the most widely used additive. Epinephrine increases the length of analgesic duration and decreases blood flow by acting as an agonist at the α1-adrenoceptor. Dexmedetomidine is not as widely used as epinephrine. Studies in humans indicate improved onset time and increased duration of analgesia.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Clonidine</b> — {{antihypertensive}} {{action of}} <b>clonidine</b> may be antagonized ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Clonidine</b> therapy should {{generally}} be gradually tapered when discontinuing therapy to avoid rebound effects from occurring. Treatment of <b>clonidine</b> withdrawal hypertension {{depends on the}} severity of the condition. Reintroduction of <b>clonidine</b> for mild cases, [...] alpha and beta blockers for more urgent situations. Beta blockers never should be used alone to treat <b>clonidine</b> withdrawal as alpha vasoconstriction would still continue.|$|E
2500|$|The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has {{approved}} <b>clonidine</b> {{for the treatment}} of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), under the trade name of Kapvay alone or with stimulants in 2010, for pediatric patients aged 6–17 years. It was later approved for adults. In Australia, <b>clonidine</b> is an accepted but not approved use for ADHD by the TGA. <b>Clonidine</b> along with methylphenidate has been studied for treatment of [...] According to the clinical trials submitted to FDA its effectiveness is comparable to stimulants commonly used for ADHD. [...] While not as effective as methylphenidate in treating ADHD, <b>Clonidine</b> does offer some benefit; it can also be useful in combination with stimulant medications. Some studies show <b>clonidine</b> more sedating than guanfacine, which may be better at bed time along with an arousing stimulant at morning. <b>Clonidine</b> can be used in the treatment of Tourette syndrome (specifically for tics).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Clonidine</b> {{also has}} several off-label uses, {{and has been}} {{prescribed}} to treat psychiatric disorders including stress, sleep disorders, and hyperarousal caused by post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, and other anxiety disorders. [...] <b>Clonidine</b> is also a mild sedative, {{and can be used}} as premedication before surgery or procedures. Its epidural use for pain during heart attack, postoperative and intractable pain has also been studied extensively. [...] <b>Clonidine</b> has also been suggested as a treatment for rare instances of dexmedetomidine withdrawal. <b>Clonidine</b> can be used in restless legs syndrome. It {{can also be used to}} treat facial flushing and redness associated with rosacea. It has also been successfully used topically in a clinical trial as a treatment for diabetic neuropathy. <b>Clonidine</b> can also be used for migraine headaches and hot flashes associated with menopause. <b>Clonidine</b> has also been used to treat diarrhea associated with irritable bowel syndrome, fecal incontinence, diabetes, withdrawal-associated diarrhea, intestinal failure, neuroendocrine tumors and cholera.|$|E
