40|$|S u m m a r y The paper {{presents}} a description and {{results of a}} flexibility study of a steel adjustable foundation <b>chock</b> (Vibracon ® SM). <b>Chocks</b> of this type are used in so-called rigid seatings (mountings) on foundations of heavy machinery and equipment, which require precise alignment and adjustment. They are an alternative to conventional (ordinary) metal <b>chocks</b> or new generation <b>chocks</b> – which are ready-cast with specifically for this purpose developed polymer composites. Experimental studies were conducted in laboratory conditions on an original new <b>chock.</b> The characteristics of deformation for this <b>chock</b> were determined in conditions close to the operation conditions of such <b>chocks.</b> The results show that in the investigated system there are significant deformations of a non-linear-elastic character.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{presented}} a new procedure of the seating of a combustion engines at the marine power plant with steel <b>chocks</b> cemented by a thixotropic polymer composition between the engine’s spot footing and the foundation ledge. A combustion engine is seated on foundation at the marine power plant by steel <b>chocks</b> or the <b>chocks</b> that are cast from polymer composition at the marine power plant. The arrangement, number and dimensions of foundation <b>chocks,</b> as well as arrangement, number and dimensions of the lateral and frontal stoppers that secure <b>chocks</b> work, are established by an engine manufacturer and are approved by Classification Society that supervises the vessel’s construction and operation. The author’s intention was to develop such <b>chocks</b> that combine the good resistance of steel <b>chocks</b> with the easiness of adjustment the bearing surfaces of polymer compositions <b>chocks.</b> Combination of these features was obtained for steel <b>chocks</b> which are glued by the relatively thin layers of polymer compositions between the engine spot footing and the foundation ledges. Such a method of making the <b>chocks</b> and seating with them the engines on foundation was claimed with the Patent RP No. 192120 on 24 th July 2000 for the Polish Naval Academy. In order to receive {{the approval of the}} Polish Register of Shipping to use new <b>chocks</b> at the marine power plants, the author carried out appropriate research, results of which are presented below. The results obtained in the research show that by seating of a combustion engine with these steel-thixotropic polymer <b>chocks</b> at the marine power plant, the foundation bolts tension can be diminished to the value equal to five times of the engine weight...|$|R
60|$|I {{was with}} the {{earliest}} of the troops to enter the Mills. In passing through to the north side, looking towards Chapultepec, I happened to notice that there were armed Mexicans still {{on top of the}} building, only a few feet from many of our men. Not seeing any stairway or ladder reaching {{to the top of the}} building, I took a few soldiers, and had a cart that happened to be standing near brought up, and, placing the shafts against the wall and <b>chocking</b> the wheels so that the cart could not back, used the shafts as a sort of ladder extending to within three or four feet of the top. By this I climbed to the roof of the building, followed by a few men, but found a private soldier had preceded me by some other way. There were still quite a number of Mexicans on the roof, among them a major and five or six officers of lower grades, who had not succeeded in getting away before our troops occupied the building. They still had their arms, while the soldier before mentioned was walking as sentry, guarding the prisoners he had SURROUNDED, all by himself. I halted the sentinel, received the swords from the commissioned officers, and proceeded, with the assistance of the soldiers now with me, to disable the muskets by striking them against the edge of the wall, and throw them to the ground below.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{selection}} of optimum <b>chock</b> (support) capacity is very crucial {{for a successful}} longwall mining. The {{selection of}} <b>chock</b> capacity depends on the site-specific geotechnical parameters, constraints and longwall panel geometry, which are generally not known in detail in priority. Hence, based {{on the field and}} laboratory data, various possible combinations should be analyzed to cater for the unforeseeable mining conditions. This paper discusses the use of numerical model for selecting an appropriate <b>chock</b> capacity based on the site-specific geological and geotechnical information and longwall panel geometry. The fracture mechanisms of immediate and main roofs are also discussed for various panel widths and support capacities. For the models considered, the <b>chock</b> convergence is predicted to increase by about 33 % due to the increase in face width from 100 to 260 m. Similarly, the massive roof strata are found to yield higher <b>chock</b> convergence compared to bedded strata...|$|R

40|$|Advances {{in modern}} {{longwall}} (LW) technology {{have resulted in}} high production faces with more powerful <b>chocks</b> and shearers that can advance at faster rates. As longwall <b>chocks</b> (supports) advance, crushed roof coal and/or rock can fall {{from the top of}} the <b>chock</b> canopy into the face ventilation airflow. Dust survey showed that <b>chock</b> movement is a significant source of dust exposure for shearer operators, accounting for about 47 % of total LW face dust make during the cutting cycle. 3 D CFD models have been developed to understand the behaviour of longwall dust particles from various sources including maingate (MG) <b>chocks</b> and stage loader/crusher. Modelling results demonstrated that much of the respirable dust particles generated from MG <b>chock</b> movements and the beam stage loader (BSL) will disperse onto the longwall face ventilation, contributing significantly to dust exposure levels. Dust control systems using ultra fine water-mist technology have demonstrated promising results in encapsulating respirable dust particles. A prototype water-mist based venturi system has been developed to firstly produce ultra-fine water droplets (5 - 15 μm) for suppressing the respirable dust particles from the MG chocks/BSL; and secondly induce a water-mist airflow with sufficient momentum to divert dust clouds off the walkway area along the face. The new system will be trialled on MG <b>chocks</b> in medium to high seam longwalls on which dust contamination appears to be more problemati...|$|R
