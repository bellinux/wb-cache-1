5000|$|Tetraphis pellucida reproduces asexually {{through the}} use of asexual propagules called gemmae. The gemmae are found either in gemma cups or stalks.Gemmae cups are {{typically}} composed of three to five larger specialized leaves, and house gemmae in the center. Stalk gemmae are found in a terminal clusteron a microphyllous stalk that extends one to four millimeters above the leafy gametophyte.Gemmae are distributed largely through the energy provided by precipitation. This is possible due to the shape of gemmae cups, it allows them to harness the energy of a raindrop to propel the gemmae.

40|$|In {{the field}} of total joint replacements, polymer nanocomposites are being {{investigated}} as alternatives to {{ultra high molecular weight}} polyethylene (UHMWPE) for acetabular <b>cup</b> <b>bearings.</b> The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the wear performance and biocompatibility of UHMWPE/graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposites. This study revealed that low concentrations of GO nanoparticles (0. 5 wt%) do not significantly alter the wear performance of UHMWPE. In contrast, the addition of higher concentrations (2 wt%) led to a significant reduction in wear. In terms of biocompatibility, UHMWPE/GO wear particles did not show any adverse effects on L 929 fibroblast and PBMNC viability at any of the concentrations tested over time. Moreover, the addition of GO to a UHMWPE matrix did not significantly affect the inflammatory response to wear particles. Further work is required to optimise the manufacturing processes to improve the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites and additional biocompatibility testing should be performed to understand the potential clinical application of these materials...|$|R
5000|$|Cannondale {{has since}} made this a free {{international}} standard known as BB30. In BB30, {{the diameter of}} the bottom bracket spindle is increased from the standard 24mm to 30mm. As a result, the inside diameter of the bottom bracket shell is increased to 42mm. This allows a reduction in weight by permitting aluminum {{to be used as a}} spindle material instead of the more traditional steel. The larger spindle in addition to the larger bottom bracket shell make for increased stiffness of both the frame and crankset. Perhaps the biggest difference between the BB30 standard and more traditional bottom brackets is the use of pressed-in bearings rather than cartridge or <b>cup</b> <b>bearings.</b> The lack of threads or extra [...] "packaging" [...] creates additional weight savings. Because of the [...] "press fit" [...] needed to hold the bearings, tighter and more precise machining tolerances are needed.

50|$|The Archaeological Collection of Galaxidi {{is under}} the {{directorate}} of the Ephorate of Antiquities of Phocis. The collection was established in 1932 in order to host antiquities found and donated by citizens as well as excavation finds from the regions in and around Galaxeidi. The exhibition is organised in three main themes: (a) Private and daily life, (b) Trade and maritime activity and (c) Cemeteries. It focuses on the educational aspects as the finds are accompanied by pictures and texts, revealing the history of ancient Haleion, the precursor of Galaxeidi. The settlements represented in the first window case are Dexameni, Kefalari, Apsifia and Anemokambi; the Early Helladic period (3200-1900 B.C.)of Haleion itself is also represented. Among the exhibits stand out Mycenaean vessels (three-eared pithoid amphora, stirrup jar and pyxis) and Geometric vessels from the cemetery of Agios Athanasios. In the next case are exhibited finds {{from the city of}} Haleion (Galaxeidi) itself. The city wall, dating to the period of the Aetolian League delimited the settlement and made it one of the best protected ports of the Corinthian gulf. At Heroon Square there was excavated a cemetery rich in finds, which reveal aspects of the daily life in Haleion. Among the finds stands out a black glazed kantharos, two lagynoi, some spindle-shaped unguentaria and terracotta lamps. To the Archaic period (7th century BC) date cotylae with angular handles, aryballoi and pyxides originating from Corinth and other vessels. Attic pottery is also represented through black-figure cylixes and lekythoi and two black-glazed kantharoi. Particularly interesting is the red-figured pelike with the representation of a man wearing the himation, supported by a stick and talking to a young man, also wearing the himation (2nd quarter of the 5th century B.C.).This is a type quite common as a similar one is exhibited in the Archaeological Museum of Amphissa and one in the Archaeological Museum of Messenia, found in Nihoria.Seven glass vessels represent the glassmaking of the 1st century A.D. Among them stands out a cast <b>cup,</b> <b>bearing</b> the inscription “Be happy in everything that you participate at”. From the woman's world are displayed mainly beauty items, such as the two bronze mirrors, pieces of bronze Geometric jewelry and a remarkable pendant {{in the form of a}} head of Ammon Zeus probably dating to the Roman period. Household weaving, one of the basic women's activities, is attested by numerous clay loom weights one of which bears the name “Agesiou”. The case opposite to the entrance comprises clay figurines and metal vessels and tools from the site Akona or Ankona. They are mainly busts, seated figures and standing figures with a tall headcover holding a bird in her chest. More than 100 bronze vessels and utensils from Galaxeidi are found scattered in 15 museums in America and Europe. They have all been illegally exported in the 19th century. In 1973 these vessels were identified through the discovery of a bell-shaped lekythos and a tall handle, which reminded of the two lekythoi of the British Museum and the one in Edinburgh which bear the indication “Galaxeidi”. In a corner case is displayed a globular amphora of the Late Early Helladic II period(2400-2200 B.C.) from Anemokambi, covered entirely with shells' residues. In a compartment with sand on the floor have been placed seven commercial amphoras for transportation of wine, dated in various periods and coming from different regions (Corinth, Corfu, Cnidus, Hellensitic of the 1st century B.C., Aegean type of the 5th-6th century A.D). At the end of the hall are displayed finds from Agios Athanasios (Geometric period) and from the town of Galaxeidi itself (Classical-Roman period). Part of a Roman marble statue and a funerary relief as well as three inscribed funerary stele of the late Hellenistic period are displayed. Geometric pottery comprises mainly skyphoi and wine jugs from Corinth as well as other vessels. The Hellenistic pottery comprises lagynoi, Corinthian kantharoi, miniature lekythoi,etc. Among the Roman vessels stands out one with the pattern of a gladiator, another one with a cupid and a third one with the depiction of a female figure, holding torches and bearing a crescent on the head, possibly an incarnation of the Night.|$|E

This {{is the first}} demonstration of cup edge-loading using the “Inverted-cup” test mode. Benefits included, (i) clinically relevant wear-patterns, and (ii) cup inclinations varying from ideal to edge-loaded during each 1 -s simulator cycle. The 60 mm head and <b>cup</b> <b>bearings</b> in metal-on-metal (MOM) hip joints showed run-in and steady-state wear phases to 10 -million cycles (Mc). MOM edge-wear was not unduly high at 1. 7 mm 3 /Mc overall, this 3 -fold higher than 60 mm MOM study without edge-loading. One MOM outlier averaged 2. 7 mm 3 /Mc, this representing the break-away wear (BAW) phenomena. A surprising result was that cups contributed 75 – 93 % of total wear. The most disturbing conclusion from review of laboratory studies was that MOM wear-rates varied 1 to > 30 mm 3 /Mc for reasons not understood. These data suggested a new hypothesis, that MOM bearings were very sensitive to external stimuli, be they simulator artifact or patient related...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this program}} {{is to improve the}} oil-off {{survivability}} of a tapered roller bearing when applied to a helicopter transmission, since the tapered bearing has shown a performance advantage in this application. However, the critical roller end-rib conjunction is vulnerable to damage in an oil-off condition. Three powdered metal materials were selected to use as the rib material for oil-off evaluation. These were: M 2 steel to a 65 % density, CBS 1000 M 65 % density, and CBS 1000 M 75 % density. The bearing styles tested were ribbed cone (inner race) and ribbed cup (outer race). Carburized solid CBS 600 was also used as a ribbed material for comparison of oil-off results. The tests were conducted at six speeds from 4000 rpm (0. 26 million DN) through 37000 rpm (2. 4 million DN). The ribbed cup style bearing achieved longer lives than the ribbed cone style. A standard bearing lasted only 10 minutes at 4000 rpm; however, the 30 -min oil-off goal was achieved through 11000 rpm using the survivable ribbed <b>cup</b> <b>bearing.</b> The oil-off lives at 37000 rpm were less than 10 seconds. The grinding of the powder metal materials and surface preparation to achieve an open porosity is extremely critical to the oil-off performance of the powder metal component...|$|E
