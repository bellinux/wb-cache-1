5|$|For the Australians, {{the attack}} had been successful, {{as they had}} gained {{possession}} of the main Ottoman line, and after being halted at The Cup they began preparing to defend their gains. Hastily erecting sandbag barriers along the parapet, they settled down {{to wait for the}} first counterattack. As they did so, the brigade reserve—the 1st Battalion—was brought up. Due to <b>crowding</b> <b>in</b> the tunnels that had been used for the attack, the reinforcements were sent via the open ground that had been in front of the old Ottoman positions; despite being behind the recently captured position, the ground was still subjected to heavy Ottoman artillery and machine-gun fire, which was being poured down from positions in overwatch on the flanks. Nevertheless, in company lots, the 1st Battalion moved up and began filling in the gaps between the assault battalions, while engineers from the 2nd Field Company began the task of extending the tunnels from The Pimple towards the new Australian line.|$|E
5|$|The 1910 Dual Contracts {{called for}} {{extending}} IRT and BMT lines to Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Owing to Queens' lack of {{development at the}} time, it did not receive many new IRT and BMT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city's Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway <b>crowding</b> <b>in</b> the other two boroughs first before building in Queens. The IRT Flushing Line was {{to be one of}} two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, and it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens' oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the turn}} of the 20th century, {{bicycles}} reduced <b>crowding</b> <b>in</b> inner-city tenements by allowing workers to commute from more spacious dwellings in the suburbs. They also reduced dependence on horses.

25|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review {{concluded that there}} is insufficient evidence to determine {{the effectiveness of these}} clear aligners. Opinion is that they are likely useful for moderate front-teeth <b>crowding.</b> <b>In</b> those with teeth that are too far forward or backward, or rotated in the socket, the aligners are likely not as effective as conventional braces. More cases of relapse of the anterior teeth have been found with clear aligners compared with conventional braces. A 2013 Cochrane review found no high-quality evidence with respect to the management of the recurrence of lower-front-teeth misalignment following treatment.|$|E
25|$|Author Edgar Allan Poe {{spent the}} last years of his life (1846 to 1849) in the Bronx at Poe Cottage, now located at Kingsbridge Road and the Grand Concourse.

25|$|As Chief Justice, he was {{responsible}} for overseeing many of the day-to-day functions of the court, and oversaw the court during its move from the capitol of Corydon to Indianapolis in 1825. In 1831 the General Assembly granted the court permission to hold sessions anywhere within Indianapolis that they should chose, due to <b>crowding</b> <b>in</b> the statehouse. Blackford petitioned to have a chamber made available in the Indiana Governor's Mansion which was at that time being used for office space. He oversaw a fourth move to the new Indiana Statehouse in 1839. The court remained there for the remainder of his time on the bench.|$|E
25|$|In July 2014, the QualityWatch {{research}} programme published in-depth analysis which tracked 41 million A attendances from 2010 to 2013. This {{showed that the}} number of patients in a department at any one time was closely linked to waiting times, and that <b>crowding</b> <b>in</b> A had increased {{as a result of a}} growing and ageing population, compounded by the freezing or reduction of A capacity. Between 2010/11 and 2012/13 crowding increased by 8%, despite a rise of just 3% in A visits, and this trend looks set to continue. Other influential factors identified by the report included temperature (with both hotter and colder weather pushing up A visits), staffing and inpatient bed numbers.|$|E
25|$|All equines have a {{parasite}} burden, and therefore treatment is periodically needed throughout life. Some steps to reduce parasite infection include regularly removing droppings from the animal's stall, shed or field; breaking up droppings in fields by harrowing or disking; minimizing <b>crowding</b> <b>in</b> fields; periodically leaving a field empty for several weeks; or placing animals other than equines {{on the field}} {{for a period of}} time, particularly ruminants, which do not host the same species of parasites as equines. If botflies are active, frequent application of fly spray may repel insects. A small pumice stone or specialized bot egg knife can also scrape off any bot eggs that were laid on the hairs of the horse.|$|E

25|$|The Cochrane {{review of}} {{surgical}} removal versus retention of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth {{suggests that the}} presence of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth may be associated with increased risk of periodontal disease affecting adjacent 2nd molar (measured by distal probing depth > 4mm on that tooth) in the long term, however it is of very low quality evidence and high risk of bias. Another study which was at high risk of bias, found no evidence to suggest that removal of asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom teeth has an effect on <b>crowding</b> <b>in</b> the dental arch. There is also insufficient evidence to highlight a difference in risk of decay with or without impacted wisdom tooth.|$|E
25|$|A {{shopping}} arcade outside fare control {{leads to}} a staircase and elevator inside {{the south side of}} 132 East 53rd Street that go up to the northeast corner of East 52nd Street and Lexington Avenue. There is a token booth and turnstile bank leading to the passageway between the two lines, which was added in 1989. Outside fare control under the Citigroup Center, there are two stairs and an elevator. The passageway extends to the staircases and escalators going down to the IND platform and contains a turnstile bank in the center. In 2003, as part of efforts to ease <b>crowding</b> <b>in</b> the station, a mezzanine was added to connect the passageway to the Third Avenue end of the IND station.|$|E
25|$|World War II and the {{war effort}} in Montreal resurrected trams <b>crowding.</b> <b>In</b> 1944, the MTC {{proposed}} a two-line network, one line running underneath Saint Catherine Street, the other under Saint Denis and Notre-Dame and Saint Jacques Streets. In 1953 the newly formed public Montreal Transportation Commission replaced streetcars by buses and proposed a single subway line reusing the 1944 plans and extending {{it all the way}} to Boulevard Crémazie, right by the D'Youville maintenance shops. By this point, construction was already well underway on Canada's first subway line in Toronto under Yonge Street, which would be opened in 1954. Still, Montreal councillors remained cautious and no work was initiated. For some of them, including Jean Drapeau during its first municipal term, public transit was a thing of the past.|$|E

25|$|From 1989 to 1996, the Camden Line {{had high}} {{ridership}} growth and substantial changes to its stations. A new station at Savage just off Route 32 was opened on July 31, 1989. MARC began service to Greenbelt station in May 1993, seven months before Metro began serving the station. On January 31, 1994, MARC expanded midday {{service on the}} Camden and Brunswick lines, opened Laurel Race Track station to relieve a parking shortage at Laurel station, and closed the underused Berwyn station on the Camden Line. On December 12, 1994, Muirkirk station (originally planned as South Laurel) was opened to reduce congestion on nearby Route 1. In 1996, a $1.2 million project added 600 parking spaces at Savage station to relieve <b>crowding.</b> <b>In</b> July 1996, the Elkridge station was closed and replaced with Dorsey station, which has a larger parking area and a dedicated interchange with Route 100.|$|E
500|$|An {{accepted}} sign of domestication is {{the presence}} of tooth <b>crowding,</b> <b>in</b> which the orientation and alignment of the teeth are described as touching, overlapping or being rotated. A 2017 study found that 18% of Beringian wolf specimens exhibit tooth crowding compared with 9% for modern wolves and 5% for domestic dogs. These specimens predate the arrival of humans and therefore there is no possibility of cross-breeding with dogs. The study indicates that tooth crowding can be a natural occurrence in some wolf ecomorphs and cannot be used to differentiate ancient wolves from early dogs.|$|E

500|$|The Third Battle of Gaza {{was never}} {{intended}} to capture the town, but to keep the garrison in place after the capture of Beersheba. Only {{the first line of}} Ottoman trenches had been the objectives of the XXI Corps, which used new infantry tactics, tanks and massed artillery organised in accordance with Western Front standards. Although all objectives had not been won, the operations had forced two regiments of the Ottoman 7th Division reserve to move away from Hareira and Sheria, forward to strengthen the Ottoman defences between Gaza and the sea. According to the British official historian, [...] "The attack on the western defences of Gaza...had fulfilled the Commander-in-Chief's object." [...] The EEF had also inflicted severe losses on the Ottoman defenders; more than one thousand of whom the EEF buried in the captured trenches. The EEF captured twenty-eight officers, 418 soldiers, twenty-nine machine guns and seven trench mortars. During the fighting, the corps infantry had advanced about [...] on a [...] front, and held their gains against repeated Ottoman counterattacks, although the attempt to create a gap for the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade to ride through was not successful. The front line defensive system on the south–west side of Gaza had been captured and the infantry occupied a position from which they could threaten [...] "Ali Muntar {{and the rest of the}} defences in front of the town." [...] The XXI Corps suffered 350 killed, 350 missing and two thousand wounded during this fighting. Many casualties were blamed on loss of direction and <b>crowding</b> <b>in</b> the captured trenches, which were too shallow.|$|E
