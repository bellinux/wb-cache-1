5|$|The Paris–Roubaix {{is famous}} for rough terrain and cobblestones, or pavé (setts), being, with the Tour of Flanders, E3 Harelbeke and Gent–Wevelgem, one of the cobbled classics. It {{has been called the}} Hell of the North, a Sunday in Hell (also the title of a film about the 1976 race), the Queen of the Classics or la Pascale: the Easter race. Since 1977, the winner of Paris–Roubaix has {{received}} a sett (<b>cobble</b> <b>stone)</b> as part of his prize.|$|E
500|$|We won't {{go as far}} as {{say that}} the five-time winner of the Tour [...] - who every year gives the winner his celebration <b>cobble</b> <b>stone</b> on behalf of the organisers— has contributed to the {{dilution}} [...] of the queen of classics, which would offend him, but his words have contributed to the snub, or the indifference, of those who stay away. The fact isn't new but the phenomenon is getting worse and is concerning. The peloton of stayaways has grown to the point where Paris–Roubaix is now only for a tight group of specialists... especially the Belgians, capable of maintaining high speed on the cobbles.|$|E
60|$|The {{man looked}} like a devil. His cap had gone, and his fiery red hair was smeared with mud. Moreover, his nose had been broken on a <b>cobble</b> <b>stone,</b> and blood from it poured all over him, while his little red eyes glared like a ferret's, and his face turned a dirty white with pain and rage. Howling out {{something}} in Scotch, {{of a sudden he}} drew his sword and rushed straight at his adversary, purposing to kill him.|$|E

50|$|The instream {{habitat of}} the Snowy River below Jindabyne can be best {{described}} as highly disturbed. Many of the in-stream features of a large upland river are not evident today. The substrate was previously typified by a clean <b>cobble</b> <b>stone</b> substrate. Today, the river channel has contracted and the substrate has a heavy cover of sediment, overlaying much of the <b>cobble</b> <b>stone</b> riverbed.|$|E
50|$|In August 1999, the Optimist Club of Greensville {{undertook}} {{a campaign to}} repair the <b>cobble</b> <b>stone</b> bridge above the falls. A total of $365,000 was raised by the club, and a grand opening of a re-built bridge took place on July 1, 2000.|$|E

5000|$|The {{district}} of Brè-Aldesago offers its visitors charming corners created by its characteristic stone buildings.

50|$|In 1920, Lamb {{designed}} for himself a private summer {{home in the}} Adirondacks {{in the village of}} Elizabethtown, New York. The house, which is still extant as a residence, is situated on the Boquet River. The eight-bedroom manor, referred to today as Cobble Mountain Lodge, is a shingle and <b>cobble</b> <b>stone</b> design marked by the inclusion of a stone turret.|$|E
50|$|The {{very large}} Gimbel’s Department Store {{occupied}} {{the corner of}} 9th and Market, and the relatively tiny Leary’s Book Store on 9th Street was separated from it by a small <b>cobble</b> <b>stoned</b> alleyway.|$|R
50|$|Two {{neighbouring}} plots on 31-33 Kmety Street remained empty. The parcel {{was used}} by the municipality as storage place for <b>cobble</b> <b>stones</b> from 1897 until 1910 when it was sold for a private villa.|$|R

50|$|On {{either side}} of the street was the Blackfriars monastery from the 1330s to the Reformation (1520-1530). Archaeological {{excavations}} in the area have unveiled the remains of the monastery's wall under the present streets. In the southern end of Tyska Stallplan several such traces have been discovered, and in Prästgatan, south of the street, lines of <b>cobble</b> <b>stone</b> are indicating the former extent of the monastery.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{trouble is}} that the Belgians then come out to see the race and they pull up a <b>cobble</b> <b>stone</b> each and take it home as a souvenir. They've even gone off with the milestones. It's a real headache. But I'm {{confident}} now that Paris-Roubaix is safe, that {{it will always be}} the race it has always been." [...] Alain Bernard, President of 'Les Amis de Paris-Roubaix', 2007.|$|E

25|$|In 1874, Hildebrand {{started an}} {{excavation}} {{of the western}} mound and opened an enormous shaft right into the cairn in {{the centre of the}} mound. Under the <b>cobble</b> <b>stones,</b> there were the charred remains of the funeral fire.|$|R
5000|$|Living {{mostly in}} rivers and streams, Coastrange {{sculpins}} {{are found in}} riffles and glides with coarse or <b>cobble</b> <b>stone</b> bottoms from [...]20m to 1.0m in depth. At night, they move into shallower, calmer waters {{on the edges of}} rivers. It occurs in virtually the same habitats as the Prickly sculpin (Cottus asper) and the two species encounter one another and interact regularly. They also tend to encounter salmon and the Three-spined stickleback as well.|$|E

50|$|Quarrying {{started in}} the Tabataud quarry in the 1890s. The {{encountered}} ores were gathered, but {{the focus of the}} mining activities was the granodiorite itself. In the beginning the granodiorite was a highly esteemed building and <b>cobble</b> <b>stone,</b> but was milled later on mainly to gravel (for roadworks etc.). In 2003 the mining came to a final halt; since then the quarry is used as a storage area for the countless trees uprooted by cyclone Lothar in 1999.|$|E

50|$|San Francisco {{is located}} on Cordoba and Santa Fe's provincial borders. The city is also located in a {{geographic}} depression. Frequently during the heavy summer rains the entire city floods with up to two feet of water that covers the city's streets.

50|$|With a matter-of-fact air and {{straightforward}} filming, Shalom Abu Bassem evaluates the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on an intimate, human scale, where a simple hello means a great deal.

But their noble intentions are tested over time, as waves of violence pass over the city, leaving blood stains on the <b>cobble</b> <b>stone</b> streets that lead to their homes.|$|E
50|$|Bozdoğan {{itself is}} a small, quiet town of {{historic}} narrow <b>cobble</b> <b>stone</b> streets, and stone houses. Bozdogan has a population 9,888, but has many basic amenities such as the newly built Rasim Mentese University. The Bozdogan municipality {{is currently working on}} a cultural park and regional hospital with millionaire Rasim Mentese, who was born in Bozdogan, and on another project aimed at switching from coal to wind and solar power. The cuisine includes pide (a flat bread) flavoured with tahinli and eaten with fresh cream which attracts many tourist within the province.|$|E
60|$|Even as he spoke, {{a distant}} clatter was heard of an {{approaching}} coach; louder and louder it grew, one or two shouts became distinguishable, then the rattle of horses' hoofs on the uneven <b>cobble</b> <b>stones,</b> and the next moment a stable boy had thrown open the coffee-room door and rushed in excitedly.|$|R
5000|$|The {{memorial}} in the Jewish cemetery was initiated on 28 May 1995. It's originated {{with the help}} of an engaged working group in the municipality with collaboration with the sculptress Marianne Roetzel from Harscheid. On old <b>cobble</b> <b>stones</b> there lies a stone tablet, this is complemented with seven columns. They symbolize Menora, the 7-armed candlestick.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{annoyance}} {{ratings and}} detection thresholds of incoming traffic are discussed {{as a function}} of road-tyre noise. Empirical data on annoyance, from the Noiseless project, can be interpreted as follows: (1) <b>cobble</b> <b>stones</b> pavements were significantly the most annoying; (2) the open asphalt rubber pavement had lower annoyance ratings but it did not differ significantly from the dense asphalt; (3) increasing speeds and traffic densities always led to higher annoyance ratings. On the other hand, as far as safety and detection of incoming traffic is concerned: (1) the hybrid vehicle was the least detected whereas the pickup truck was the most detected; (2) a clear effect of pavement type was found, with less detections for the asphalt rubber pavement while the <b>cobble</b> <b>stones</b> pavement always provided good detection.
