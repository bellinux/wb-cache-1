40|$|Using Portugal's {{extensive}} matched employer-employee data set, {{this paper}} documents an unusual {{feature of the}} Portuguese economy. For decades, the entire Portuguese firm size distribution has been shifting to the left. We argue in this paper that Portugal's shrinking firms {{are linked to the}} country's anemic growth and low productivity. We show that the shift in the Portuguese firm size distribution is not reflected in other advanced industrial economies for which {{we have been able to}} obtain comparable data. Careful attempts to account for expanding data coverage, a structural shift from manufacturing to services, and aggressive efforts to "demonopolize" the Portuguese economy leave about half of this shift unexplained by these factors. So, what does explain the shift? We argue that Portugal's uniquely strong protections for regular workers have played an important role. Drawing upon an emerging literature that that attributes much of the productivity gap between advanced nations and developing nations to the misallocation of resources across firms in developing countries, we develop a theoretical model that shows how Portugal's labor market institutions could prevent more productive firms from reaching their optimal size, thereby constraining GDP per capita. <b>Calibration</b> <b>exercises</b> based on this model quantify the degree of labor market distortion consistent with recent shifts in the Portuguese firm size distribution. These <b>calibration</b> <b>exercises</b> suggest quite substantial growth effects could arise if the distortions were lessened or abolished altogether. ...|$|R

To this end a growth model with endogenous innovation and accumulation of high-tech and low-tech human capital is developed. We consider a negative effect of technological development on the accumulation of high-tech human capital and that services are relatively intensive in low-tech human capital.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{dependence}} of production on foreign inputs (or non-producible natural resources) can significantly {{increase the likelihood}} of indeterminacy.

This is demonstrated using a standard neoclassical growth model. <b>Calibration</b> <b>exercise</b> shows that the required increasing returns to scale can be reduced by as much as 64 % based on estimated share of foreign inputs in production for OECD countries. ...|$|E
40|$|Since 1992, {{northern}} and southern hake (Merluccius merluccius) stock assessments have used age data based on otolith analysis. Age data for stock assessment is provided by different institutions, which implies a quantification of age‐reading precision to estimate assessment quality indicators. During this period, considerable effort {{has been made to}} improve the precision of age data by means of successive agereading <b>calibration</b> <b>exercises,</b> exchanges, and workshops in 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2004. This goal was partly achieved, and experts recently agreed on standard criteria (Piñeiro and Saínza, 2003) that allowed an acceptable precision to be reached for ages up to 3 years (Piñeiro et al., 2004). However, these criteria have never been validated, and recent mark ‒ recapture experiments are not in line with ageing results based on the standard criteria. Given the impact of bias in age estimation on stock assessment results, consequent management advice, and concern {{about the state of the}} hake stocks (ICES, 2007 a, 2007 b), a report on the current state of the art is needed.

A successful joint calibration to real market data is presented together with various in- and out-of-sample <b>calibration</b> <b>exercises</b> to highlight the robustness of the parameters estimation.

It provides a novel interpretation of such models, specifies consistency criteria for long-run analysis, and proposes metrics for model convergence. Analytical and <b>calibration</b> <b>exercises</b> are conducted to show that convergence to perfect foresight need not occur and even when it occurs it does not ensure that relationships between long-run averages or low-frequency components are captured by perfect foresight models.

40|$|We {{construct}} a dynamic assignment model that explains persistent productivity differences between firms. Large expected organization capital (firm-specific knowledge) attracts skilled workers, who help to accumulate organization capital.

This behavior contrasts sharply with the implications of many pricing models and with the asymptotic behavior implied by the central limit theorem (CLT). We develop a parsimonious model which deliberately violates the CLT assumptions and thus captures the observed behavior of the volatility smirk over the maturity horizon. <b>Calibration</b> <b>exercises</b> demonstrate its superior performance against several widely used alternatives...|$|R
