According to Indian site GameGuru, the supposed game would apparently introduce a morality system where the choices players make would branch the storyline and the plot would be unveiled entirely through the player's perspective without cutscenes. In 2011, it was revealed that a new title, called Perfect Dark Core, was in development at one point, but was ultimately canceled. The game was intended to feature a more realistic atmosphere than its predecessors, with a [...] "smoking, flirting" [...] Joanna Dark. In 2012, Chris Seavor, {{who was in charge of}} project, mentioned Deus Ex as inspirations for the game. According to him, [...] "It wasn't as narrow as something like <b>Call</b> <b>Duty</b> , where it's like, walk, cutscene, walk, cutscene. It was definitely going to be, you could go over here and do this over here, or you could go over here and do this over here. And then it would bottleneck down to something that would then take you to the next bit. It was very much about missions and storyline." [...] He also said that the game would feature several parkour mechanics, including jumping from walls. He commented, [...] "we had that really good. There was a really nice feel to it. So you could fight like that, and then there was the more traditional gun shooting." [...] The game was in development for nearly a year. It was canceled since Perfect Dark Zero did not sell as many copies as Microsoft had hoped, leading them to prioritize the development of the Halo series.|$|E
50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} against enemy Viet Cong forces {{at the risk}} of his life above and beyond the <b>call</b> <b>duty</b> while serving as Platoon Sergeant of the Third Platoon, Company F, Second Battalion, Third Marines, Third Marine Division (Reinforced), Fleet Marine Force, in Quang Ngai Province, Republic of Vietnam on 25 February 1966. Leading his platoon on a search and destroy operation in an area made particularly hazardous by extensive cave and tunnel complexes, Sergeant Connor maneuvered his unit aggressively forward under intermittent enemy small-arms fire. Exhibiting particular alertness and keen observation, he spotted an enemy spider hole emplacement approximately fifteen meters to his front. He pulled the pin from a fragmentation grenade intending to charge the hole boldly and drop the missile into its depths. Upon pulling the pin he realized that the firing mechanism was faulty, and that even as he held the safety device firmly in place, the fuze charge was already activated. With only precious seconds to decide, he further realized that he could not cover the distance to the small opening of the spider hole in sufficient time, and that to hurl the deadly bomb in any direction would result in death or injury to some of his comrades tactically deployed near him. Manifesting extraordinary gallantry and with utter disregard for his personal safety, he chose to hold the grenade against his own body in order to absorb the terrific explosion and spare his comrades. His act of extreme valor and selflessness in the face of virtually certain death, although leaving him mortally wounded, spared many of his fellow Marines from death or injury. His gallant action in giving his life in the cause of freedom reflects the highest credit upon the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.|$|E

They list several potential yet unknown causes for the increase in stress, such as disorientation or an undeclared emergency. Concerning the pilot's performance, the AAIB summarizes: The combined effects of fatigue, possible over-load and lack of recent flying practise would have caused the pilot's performance to become more variable, especially in tasks that required sustained attention, such as precision instrument flying... If, as is probable, the last transmission was made very shortly before the accident, it indicates that the pilot's situational awareness may have been seriously degraded, as he was therefore unaware of the aircraft's very low altitude... Although there are signs of overload and fatigue, it is unlikely that the pilot became so focused on one aspect of flying the aircraft that he neglected to monitor the aircraft's altitude for a protracted period. It is therefore possible that a further factor such as distraction or disorientation may have played a part.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} {{workload}} and work patterns of junior doctors of all grades while on call. DESIGN [...] Pilot study of activity data self recorded by junior doctors, {{with the help}} of students during busy periods.

SUBJECTS [...] Four registrars, three senior house officers, and five preregistration house officers. RESULTS [...] Senior house officers and preregistration house officers spent nearly half of all their on <b>call</b> <b>duty</b> time working, but less than half of that time was spent in direct contact with patients. Registrars were on call more often than the house officers but spent less than one fifth of their on <b>call</b> <b>duty</b> time working, and almost two thirds of that time was spent in direct contact with patients. CONCLUSIONS [...] Workload while on duty is excessive for both senior and preregistration house officers.

Afterwards questions about the previous nights sleeping hours as well as questions about physical and emotional condition had to be answered. A control group of 13 students without any experience in laparoscopic surgery went thrue the same setting but without sleep deprivation. Both testing groups accomplished a five day training period before the actual testing time. During the training of five days all test persons (including the students) reached a similar level of skills on the VEST-System. Hence no learning effects could have affected the actual testing period. The results showed no significant deterioration of psychomotoric skills after sleep deprivation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{studied the}} {{response}} of males to the singing of nearby male conspecifics in two species of the orthopteran genus Cyphoderris, primitive relatives of crickets and katydids. Lone male Cyphoderris buckelli stridulating in a large cage made a phonotactic approach to a nearby speaker broadcasting conspecific calling song. But in field experiments no phonotaxis to song broadcasts occurred; rather, {{a significant number of}} male C. buckelli increased their chirp duty cycle and pulse rate. There was no change in their carrier frequency. Calling male Cyphoderris monstrosa were exposed in the field to (i) playback of a synthetic calling song at a typical conspecific pulse rate, (ii) relayed broadcast of their own call, and (iii) low-frequency audio noise. <b>Call</b> <b>duty</b> cycle decreased significantly in response to the noise, while the pooled song models fell just short of significance. Singing C. buckelli were marked individually and their perches flagged over successive nights. We observed low site fidelity and extensive male displacement. Such behaviour is inconsistent with defense of topographically fixed singing territories and concurs with the absence of fighting in this species. Chirp duty cycle was increased significantly in C. buckelli in response to the singing of nearby conspecifics, but unlike in C. monstrosa, this change in duty cycle plays no role in overt aggression, though it may maintain a male’s relative attractiveness to females.
