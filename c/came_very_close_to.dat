5|$|Alston guided {{his teams}} {{to at least}} 85 wins per season between 1969 and 1976. They {{finished}} in second place in their division six times during that span. The team <b>came</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> a pennant in 1971; after falling 11 games out of first place, the team performed well {{late in the season}} and finished one game behind the San Francisco Giants. Beginning in 1973, Alston's team featured an infield of Steve Garvey, Davey Lopes, Bill Russell and Ron Cey. The group played together for eight years, remaining together long after the end of Alston's tenure.|$|E
5|$|As {{the club}} changed their name to Società Sportiva Calcio Napoli on 25 June 1964 {{they began to}} rise up again, gaining {{promotion}} in 1964–65. Under the management of former player Bruno Pesaola, they won the Coppa delle Alpi and were back amongst the elite in Serie A, with consistent top-five finishes. Napoli <b>came</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> winning the league in 1967–68, finishing just behind Milan in second place. Some {{of the most popular}} players from this period were Dino Zoff, José Altafini, Omar Sívori and hometown midfielder Antonio Juliano. Juliano would eventually break the appearance records, which still stands today.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1975 season, Pryce's future was subject to much speculation. Rumour linked him with a drive at Lotus, the team run by Colin Chapman, who had been keeping an eye on Pryce's {{progress}} throughout 1973 and 1974. At the time, Lotus was experiencing financial difficulties and reports suggested that Shadow and Lotus would swap Pryce and Swede Ronnie Peterson. The trade was viewed as a good acquisition for both teams, as Pryce was considered a driver of the same ability as Peterson, but would cost Lotus less, while Peterson could attract sponsorship to the relatively new Shadow team. The deal never materialised, although Shadow team manager Alan Rees claims that it <b>came</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> being completed.|$|E

Another pentito, Francesco Di Carlo, declared in 2001 that De Mauro was killed because he had learned {{that one of his}} former fascist friends, Prince Junio Valerio Borghese, was planning a coup d'état (the so-called Golpe Borghese) with like-minded army officers determined to stop what they considered as Italy's drift to the left. Yet another pentito, Rosario Naimo, who started to collaborate with the Italian authorities after his arrest in October 2010, said that the journalist was killed because of his investigative reporting that damaged the Mafia.|$|E
5|$|Hawker Siddeley aggressively marketed the Harrier for export. At {{one point}} the company was holding talks with Australia, Brazil, Switzerland, India and Japan.

Following an overture by the UK in the early 1970s, when relations with the West were warming, China became interested in the aircraft as it sought to modernise its armed forces; British Prime Minister James Callaghan noted significant hostility from the USSR over the sales bid. The deal was later cancelled by the UK as part of a diplomatic backlash after China invaded Vietnam in 1979.|$|E

The tonnage of bombs dropped suggested {{there were fewer}} bombers than claimed. The RAF fighters claimed four Do 17s. The fact remains that the Germans penetrated the airspace without interception and <b>came</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> inflicting critical damage to the Spitfire factory. The radar had done its job and alerted No. 11 and 10 Group 20 minutes before the bombs started to fall.

5|$|Saeed joined Al-Jameaa, {{currently}} {{known as}} Al-Talaba, {{when he was}} 17 years old in 1975 with an invitation from the manager Jamal Salih who lived in Saeed's neighborhood. His first match for Al-Jameaa was in the 1975–76 Iraqi League against Al-Shorta, which ended in a 3–0 win for Al-Jameaa. He scored his first goal with the club in his second match against Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, where Al-Jameaa won with Saeed's only goal. The club eventually finished in 8th place. They <b>came</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> achieve the league in the 1976–77 season but they settled in 2nd place in the league table behind Al-Zawra'a. In the 1977–78 season, Saeed scored three goals with his team finishing in 8th place.|$|E
5|$|On August7, a banding eye feature {{developed}} with deep convection around the eastern {{portion of the}} storm. Later that day, the storm sharply recurved towards the northeast and paralleled the southern coastline of Honshu. As Maria made the turn, dry air began to enter the system, causing it to weaken. Along with the dry air, wind shear began to increase and the JMA downgraded Maria to a severe tropical storm early on August8. The storm continued to weaken as it <b>came</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> landfall near Tokyo, Japan on August9. Both agencies downgraded Maria to a tropical depression early on August9, with the JTWC issuing their final advisory at that time. Maria remained a tropical depression for another 24hours before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on August10 while located about 835km (520mi) east-northeast of Tokyo. The extratropical remnants turned towards the north and dissipated late on August14 over the Sea of Okhotsk.|$|E

5|$|Several investors {{stepped forward}} with offers {{to buy the}} Buccaneers after Culverhouse's death, {{including}} Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, New York Yankees owner (and Tampa resident) George Steinbrenner, and Massachusetts developer Socrates Babacas. In response to the ensuing publicity, the trust administering Culverhouse's estate then issued a statement that the team was not for sale. They reversed their position two months later, as a poor early-season record led to declining fan support and revenues. The decision to sell the franchise came {{on the same day}} that Joy filed a $25 million claim against Hugh's estate. Hugh had paid $16 million for the franchise, which was now valued at $142 million. With Barnett Bank filing claims for $20.8 million against the Culverhouse estate, the trustees <b>came</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> accepting Angelos' $200 million offer, which would have involved relocating the team to Baltimore, Maryland. Fearful of losing the team, civic leaders presented a proposal guaranteeing ticket sales of at least 55,000 for all home games for the next two years. The team was eventually sold to Palm Beach, Florida businessman Malcolm Glazer for $192 million, at that moment the largest price ever paid for a professional sports franchise.|$|E
