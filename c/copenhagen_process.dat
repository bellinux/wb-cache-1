40|$|HIV/AIDS is {{an urgent}} health issue {{in many areas}} of the world, {{particularly}} in Africa. In addition to reaching pandemic status, HIV/AIDS is also being elevated to the level of a security threat. While this is occurring both nationally and internationally, the United Nations is leading this securitization attempt. The UN has been able to engage in this attempt as it is the most influential international organization and the leading norm promoting organization. Securitization is an analytic process that traces how issues become identified and understood as security threats. This concept originated within the Copenhagen school of security studies, and this is the framework that this paper relies on to analyze the connection between HIV/AIDS and security. The connection between HIV/AIDS and security is now widely internalized, accepted and even promoted by national governments, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations. However, the successful securitization of HIV/AIDS has yet to be fully explored, understood, or tested. This paper undertakes this task, and relies on the <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>process</b> of securitization to trace the security discourse initiated from the UN, down through four selected case studies. It identifies which of the key Copenhagen requirements for securitization have been met, and which have not been met, ultimately leading to the conclusion that the United Nations prompted a successful internal securitization and an unsuccessful external securitization. This paper concludes that the current Copenhagen school process of securitization is flawed and is inadequate for studying today’s emerging non-traditional threats. In particular, it is unable to trace the securitization of HIV/AIDS as a result of stringent and unrepresentative criterions.

Higher education institutions should recognise prior learning outcomes to be equivalent to certain study requirements after a formal procedure of evaluation. This idea introduces a mechanism of opening and permeability into highly regulated authorisation systems such as the German one based primarily on formal qualifications that include the entitlement to study at a university. This idea seems to be diametrically opposed to the tradition of segmentation between vocational and higher education. In the meantime, many higher education institutions—more in the sector of Fachhochschulen than universities—have implemented such procedures of recognition, even though the situation is still far away from being introduced on a country- or institutional-wide basis.|$|E

40|$|Countries {{around the}} world have {{witnessed}} educational expansion at all levels, leading to the massification of tertiary education and training. Tertiary education has become a major factor of economic competitiveness in an increasingly science‐based global economy and a key response to shifts in national labour markets. Within the EU, the reform of skill formation systems has been advanced by the Lisbon strategy, with the Bologna and <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>processes</b> in higher education (HE) and vocational education and training (VET) articulating and diffusing overarching goals in European skill formation. If European benchmarks call for at least 40 % of all 30 ‐ to 34 ‐year‐olds to hold a tertiary‐level certificate, Germany exhibits a relatively low proportion of each cohort entering HE and attaining that qualification level (28 %). We analyse this ‘German exceptionalism’, locating a range of factors in the educational system: the institutional logic of segregation, the structure of secondary schooling, the division or schism between the organisational fields of VET and HE, and limited permeability throughout. Regardless of isomorphic pressures that led Germany to quickly implement undergraduate bachelor's (BA) and graduate master's (MA) courses of study, these factors limit the extent of HE expansion visible among other European countries...|$|R

40|$|Summary Vocational {{education}} and training (VET) is regarded by EU policymakers as crucial to cre-ating a high-skill workforce capable of adapting to European and global demands in an intensified competitive environment. It {{is part of the}} so-called <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Process,</b> in which social dialogue between employers and employees is seen as an important means of realizing policy. However, many of the new member states from the Eastern European countries which joined the European Union in 2004 have only weak forms of social dialogue. Moreover, the prevailing neo-liberal environment in many post-communist new member states undermines ‘reform fit ’ between broad European social policy goals and narrower domestic agendas.

40|$|The {{monograph}} {{presents an}} overview of the system regulating the recognition of non-formal and informal learning in the European Union. Non-formal and informal learning are an important factor in the further development of such a qualification and of the educational system in the European Union. This is demonstrated by current strategic documents, for example the Lisbon Strategy, Memorandum on lifelong learning, Resolution on lifelong learning, etc. This is also part of the Bologna and <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>processes.</b> The success of the development of non-formal and informal learning will be dependent on the level of development of the recognition of non-formal and informal learning. In an effort to establish a uniform system of development in this area, the ministers of education adopted common guidelines for the recognition of prior learning. Despite this desire for homogenized recognition of learning, there is in the European Union a range of different forms of recognition. Thus, the monograph will deal with the response of individual countries to homogenization. We were especially interested in analysing a normative basis for the recognition of prior learning and qualifications in the Slovenian educational system. ...|$|R
40|$|The Bologna and <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>processes</b> promote {{standards}} for the categorization of educational programs and qualifications throughout Europe – with the goal to create greater transparency and permeability in European skill formation. However, key tools of Europeanization, like the Bachelor and Master degree cycles and the European Qualification Framework, fail to acknowledge important cultural, normative, and regulative idiosyncrasies of the educational systems in Austria and Germany. In both countries the sectors of vocational training and academic education represent distinct organizational fields divided by an "educational schism". The tensions and contradictions that accompany this traditional institutional divide have in many cases been masked by patterns of loose coupling. However, the current Europeanization processes tend to unsettle these patterns, which unleashes conflicts between the actors of the respective organizational fields, for example, {{with regard to the}} placement of the different certificates in the common qualification framework. The outcome of these struggles often is that the institutional divide between vocational training and academic education is widening rather than narrowing.

40|$|For decades, {{the skill}} {{formation}} systems in France and Germany have been analysed as contrasting cases because of institutionalised differences in educational values, norms, and governance, {{as well as}} in labour markets. This comparison follows the logic of difference, comparing dissimilar skill formation systems in centralist France and federalist Germany. Cross-national variance has often been explained in terms of the institutionalization of vocational education, but higher education also differs considerably. Many typologies of vocational education and training (VET) and higher education (HE) summarise these differences. However, not only are national skill formation systems affected by the emerging European model of education via the Bologna and <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Processes,</b> but the French and German political economies have also been greatly reconfigured in the last two decades. Comparing the present situation, we ask whether traditional education and training typologies continue to be valid. While they have served as useful heuristic devices, they may hinder recognition of contemporary institutional changes, especially incremental changes that may nevertheless be transformational because of endogenous reforms and exogenous pressures due to Europeanisation. Do these typologies continue to reflect these systems as they evolve?

40|$|ABSTRACT This article aims {{to analyse}} the interrelationship between the <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Process,</b> EU {{vocational}} {{education and training}} policy, and Danish initial vocational education and training policies in order {{to shed light on}} the role of EU policies in policy and institutional change. The article points to the complexity of policy-making and the crisscrossing of policies across the globe. A major change is the acceptance of the EU as a stakeholder in vocational education and training policy-making and thereby an expansion of the policy space. However, the changes taking place at national level are incremental and the EU policy is translated in the national context, where it contributes to the re-accentuation of existing conflicts and fissures. … joint efforts to develop a European Qualifications Framework (EQF) based on learning outcomes are having a significant catalytic effect: the EQF appears to be substantially contributing to the implementation of national qualifications frameworks; the principles on which it is based have significant consequences on the organisation of systems and are applied to all sectors and levels of education and training.

40|$|National Qualification Frameworks (NQF) offer common sets of {{principles}} and references. They provide {{the opportunity to}} make informed decisions on the relevance and value of qualifications.

Approaches to achieving coherence and clarity through NQF vary from country to country.

The <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Process</b> and the way it strives to increase the portability of qualifications has pushed the issue of qualification frameworks upwards on European education and training policy agendas.

40|$|Education Planning and Policy On every continent, {{educational}} systems {{are considered the}} exclusive responsibil-ity of individual states. Particularly in Europe, developing {{educational systems}} was viewed as {{an important part of}} nation building 1 until World War II. After the war, however, there was a concerted effort to harmonize educational policies to protect the continent from nationalist excesses that had originally led to war. The {{purpose of this article is}} to trace the evolution of national systems and modes of intervention by supernational and international organizations in order understand the institutional convergence across Europe of different policy frameworks for education. Our primary argument is that as different states consent to European-level educational frameworks—a phenomenon referred to as “relinquishment” 2 — their actions will be interpreted as the expression of their acceptance of the de facto integration of differing national educational policies. The “European area ” of education and life-long learning established by the Bologna and <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>processes</b> has important implications for policy making for the countries of the European Union [EU].

40|$|Given ongoing economic, {{political}} and social transformation, skill formation systems are under pressure to change. This is acknowledged in European declarations - Bologna for higher education and Copenhagen for vocational training - and various national reform processes. The omnipresent convergence hypothesis is that these international pressures will result in national skill formation systems becoming more similar. However, if these systems throughout Europe are to match the dominant Anglophone models, which value general higher education more than specific vocational training, those countries with strong apprenticeship traditions are especially challenged. Due to countries' differential starting points, the convergence hypothesis needs to be tested, taking the shifting complementary and competitive {{relationship between the two}} organizational fields of higher education and vocational training into account. Ideational internationalization, and normative and regulative Europeanization, as manifest in the Bologna and <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>processes,</b> require analysis as factors driving institutional change in post-secondary higher and vocational educational systems. Key questions are: will common trends and challenges lead to cross-national convergence of skill formation systems? Or do national responses instead indicate that adaptations are mainly consistent with specific cultural and structural characteristics? This article discusses why, in order to answer such questions adequately, in-depth comparative research should overcome the persistent division in research on these two sectors by examining the nexus of higher education and vocational training...|$|R

The process of adapting cities to climate changes {{can be seen as a}} task for the spatial planing, a process that can be called climate adaption. However, the question of adapting cities to future climate changes is at low priority due to many causes.

40|$|The {{past several}} decades have seen a Copernican shift in the {{paradigm}} of armed conflict, which the traditional Law of International Armed Conflict (LOIAC) canon has not fully matched. Standing out in stark relief {{against the backdrop of}} relative inactivity in LOIAC, is the surfeit of activity in the field of international human rights law, which has become a dramatic new force in the ancient realm of international law. Human rights law, heretofore not formally part of the traditional juridico-military calculus, has gained ever increasing salience in that calculus. Indeed, human rights law has ramified in such a manner that – given the nature of contemporary conflict, it is no longer possible to address one body of law without also dealing with the other. This has been the most dramatic trend for LOIAC in the last decade. It will doubtlessly continue. This article briefly addresses this interesting and important phenomenon {{in the context of the}} history of LOIAC and modern warfare, which has changed from large-scale clashes of the military might of sovereign states to conflict characterized by long-term guerilla and asymmetric warfare, concomitant counterinsurgency, and stability operations. The nature of contemporary stability operations and counterinsurgency has broadened the scope of military operations so that commanders must now engage in a range of activities not traditionally considered combat-related. Associated with this expanded range of military responsibility is an expanded range of legal responsibility. Hence, we arrive at the necessity and value of human rights law. We briefly identify the general implications of the legal trend and illuminate some notable aspects of the legal landscape that loom before military commanders and their advisors. The issue of where, when, and how human rights protections apply is essential to understanding their functionality. The treatment of detainees is a prime example of the expanded range of legal responsibility that implicates human rights law. Thus, our discussion of jurisdiction includes analysis of variations among some countries and various regional and international organizations, which differ in their positions on the proper extraterritorial application or jurisdictional scope of their own and international human rights norms. This includes analysis of recent interesting decisions from the British House of Lords and the European Court of Human Rights. Finally, we discuss the <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Process,</b> which began with the first Copenhagen Conference held in October 2007. The <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>Process</b> is an effort to establish a common platform for the handling of detainees which illustrates how intertwined strands of international human rights law and LOIAC have become.

Beyond this diffuse influence, more concrete programmes, such as the EuroSocial Programme, have been set up by the European Union with a view to offering some support for increasing social cohesion in that region. The developing countries engaged in negotiations with the European Union should exploit further the harmful effect that incoherencies within the European Union’s external action might have for the European Union itself.

40|$|We report {{numerical}} simulation results using a multiyear global multi country modeling framework which {{we use to}} assess the impacts of alternative emissions cuts which will likely come under consideration for the process to follow the December 2009 UNFCCC negotiation in Copenhagen. The Copenhagen Accord sets out prior country unilateral commitments, and provides a framework for further negotiation of mutually agreed cuts. We also consider possible financial transfers under the Adaptation Fund and possible trade linked border measures against non participants. Countries are linked not only through shared impacts of global temperature change but also through trade among country subscripted goods. We can thus evaluate the potential impacts of either explicit or implicit accompanying mechanisms including funds/transfers, border adjustments, and tariffs. We calibrate the model to alternative BAU damage scenarios largely {{as set out in}} the Stern report. The welfare impacts of both emission reductions and accompanying measures are computed in Hicksian money metric equivalent form over alternative potential commitment periods: 2012 - 2020, 2012 - 2030, and 2012 - 2050. We consider different depth, forms, and timeframes for reductions by China, India, Russia, Brazil, US, EU, Japan and a residual Row. Given the damage estimates we use all countries lose from joint reductions since their foregone consumption is more costly than saved damage from reduced climate change. With the use of larger damage estimates this reverses the depth of cut and allocation of cuts by country cause large differences in impacts by country, while differences in form of cut (intensity, embedment) matter less. Accompanying mechanisms also can make a large difference to participation decisions and especially for large population, low wage, rapidly growing non OECD countries, but are costly for the OECD countries.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{provided for}} the conference presents initiatives which have been launched within last year {{in order to improve}} training of trainers and TVET teachers all over Europe by establishing Europe-wide standards and networks relating national debates to European issues. For the purpose of better understanding, the background will be shortly described against which all European activities in the area of education and training nowadays should be considered; the Lisbon Agenda from 2000 and all processes related to or derived from it, as the Bologna process in the field of tertiary education, the <b>Copenhagen</b> <b>process</b> in the area of VET, and, in particular, the set-up of the European Qualification Framework for Lifelong Learning (EQF) which is now available as a Europe-wide usable reference grid to describe national and sectoral qualification systems in terms of learning outcomes, intended to enhance transparency of certificates all over Europe for various purposes, as mobility of students, employees and competition with regard to efficiency of learning, etc. It will then be highlighted which initiatives at European level have been undertaken in order to support specifically the improvement of trainers’ and TVET teachers competences {{with the help of the}} EQF. After a short overview of some studies and papers initiated by the European Commission and CEDEFOP, the European Centre of Vocational Training Development, the presentation will focus on the European Training of Trainers Network (TTNet) and the initiative to establish a European Competence Framework for VET Professions. Taking in account that the overall aim of the framework should be to support the quality of vocational teaching and training in Europe, which includes finally the delivering of benchmarks for best practice, it will be shown that it is problematic to start with (national) occupational profiling (resp. curricula) and corresponding activities of trainers and VET teachers, and to assign them to EQF levels; Profiles often have to be considered as bundles of obligations which are not necessarily directly oriented to the general objective of delivering best training, but reflect more on the specific (institutional, market) conditions under which training is carried out. These circumstances (as dealing with administrative or financial matters) are nearly always connected to specific national settings resp. traditions, not necessarily to be considered as a model for improving the system of training the trainers elsewhere. Before setting up a competence framework in the field of training trainers and TVET teachers, we regard it therefore as crucial to determine clearly the actual domain of trainers’ or TVET teachers who work independently from specific national environments, and then to relate national profiles to it. Taken as starting point the work process and training requirements derived from it (incl. the needs arising from the change of work processes) some general recommendations will be made how trans-national standards can be used successfully as an instrument to enhance training of trainers or TVET teachers and TVET in general. </p...|$|E

Tricky tries to pin the blame on baseball player Curt Flood and the nation of Denmark, managing to obliterate the city of <b>Copenhagen</b> in the <b>process.</b> After an operation to remove his upper lip sweat gland, he is eventually assassinated by being drowned in a giant baggie filled with water, his corpse in the fetal position. Tricky ends the novel in Hell, campaigning against Satan for the position of Devil.|$|R
50|$|The {{economic}} situation in Denmark {{was one of}} high unemployment and poor housing, especially in Copenhagen. In the 1970s, the Copenhagen City Council, led by a social democratic mayor, Egon Weidekamp, had begun a process of rehousing for {{people living in the}} poor areas of <b>Copenhagen.</b> The <b>process</b> involved the demolition of large parts of the old boroughs surrounding the city center. Although the intent was to raise the standard of living for working-class people, the consequence was that the new houses often became too expensive for those very people to live in. Many found themselves temporarily relocated to elsewhere in the city, and when they wanted to return to their old homes, they found the rent to be too high for them to pay. This gave rise to a growing anger towards the city council and a feeling amongst the poor people of Copenhagen that decisions concerning their lives were being made without them having anything to say about it. The city's plans also left many old and worn, but still useful, buildings empty. At the same time, {{a lot of young people}} were unemployed and without homes. All these factors opened the door to widespread squatting.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis applies securitisation theory to the Israeli-Palestinian case with a particular focus on the potential for desecuritisation processes arising from Israeli-Palestinian cooperation/coexistence efforts in peace education and water management. It aims to apply securitisation theory {{in general and the}} under-employed concept of desecuritisation in particular, to explore the limits and prospects as a theoretical framework. Concepts, arguments and assumptions associated with the securitisation theory of the Copenhagen School are considered. In this regard, the thesis makes a contribution to Security Studies through its application of securitisation theory and sheds light on a complex conflict situation. Based on an analytical framework that integrates the concept of desecuritisation with the concepts of peace-building and peace-making, the thesis pays attention to desecuritisation moves involving Israeli and Palestinian civil societies through peace education and water management. The thesis contributes to debates over the problems and prospects of reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians, so making a significant empirical and theoretical contribution {{in the development of the}} concept of desecuritisation as a framework for analysing conflict resolution. The thesis develops an analytical framework that combines political level peace-making with civil society actors' peace-building efforts. These are seen as potential processes of desecuritisation; indeed, for desecuritisation to occur. The thesis argues that a combination of moves at both the political and societal levels is required. By contrast to securitisation processes which are mainly initiated by political andlor military elites with the moral consent of society (or 'audience' in <b>Copenhagen</b> School terms), <b>processes</b> of desecuritisation, especially in cases of protracted conflicts, go beyond the level of elites to involve society in cultural and structural peace-building programmes. Israeli-Palestinian peace education and water management cases are employed to illustrate this argument...|$|R
