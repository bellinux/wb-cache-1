5|$|A <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> a {{group of}} loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they {{can be regarded as}} a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E

5|$|A {{much larger}} galaxy <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> the redshift-0.0354 Abell 2063. The <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to be}} {{interacting}} with the nearby galaxy group MKW 3s, based on radial velocity measurements of galaxies and the positioning of the cD galaxy {{at the center of}} Abell 2063. The active galaxy at the center of MKW 3s—NGC 5920—appears to be creating a bubble of hot gas from its radio activity. Near the 5th-magnitude star Pi Serpentis lies AWM 4, a cluster containing an excess of metals in the intracluster medium. The central galaxy, NGC 6051, is a radio galaxy that is probably responsible for this enrichment. Similar to AWM 4, the cluster Abell 2052 has central cD radio galaxy, 3C 317. This radio galaxy is believed to have restarted after a period of inactivity less than 200 years ago. The galaxy has over 40,000 known globular clusters, the highest known total of any galaxy as of 2002.|$|E
5|$|Another way of {{estimating}} {{the age of}} the <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> by looking at the lowest-mass objects. In normal main-sequence stars, lithium is rapidly destroyed in nuclear fusion reactions. Brown dwarfs can retain their lithium, however. Due to lithium's very low ignition temperature of 2.5 × 106 K, the highest-mass brown dwarfs will burn it eventually, and so determining the highest mass of brown dwarfs still containing lithium in the cluster can give an idea of its age. Applying this technique to the Pleiades gives an age of about 115 million years.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{characterize}} the morphology of a globular cluster {{by means of}} standard radii. These are the core radius (r'c), the half-light radius (r'h), and the tidal (or Jacobi) radius (r't). The overall luminosity of the cluster steadily decreases with distance from the core, and the core radius is the distance at which the apparent surface luminosity has dropped by half. A comparable quantity is the half-light radius, or {{the distance from the}} core within which half the total luminosity from the <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> received. This is typically larger than the core radius.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This talk is {{an attempt}} at {{structuring}} and systematising the develop-ment of clustering as a discipline. As the attendants to this conference <b>are</b> well aware, <b>clustering</b> <b>is</b> devoted to finding and describing cohesive or similar or homo-geneous parts in data, the clusters. Common clustering structures are: partition, hierarchy, and a single cluster. Among distinguishabe goals of <b>clustering</b> <b>are</b> data structuring, data describing, data generalizing, associating aspects, and information visualising. At least four different frameworks can be distingushed {{in the literature on}} clus-tering as a data analysis discipline: probabilistic statistics, machine learning, data mining, and knowledge discovery. In probabilistic statistics, <b>clustering</b> <b>is</b> a method to fit a prespecified probabilistic model of the data generating mechanism. In ma-chine learning, <b>clustering</b> <b>is</b> a tool for prediction. In data mining, <b>clustering</b> <b>is</b> a tool for finding patterns and regularities within the data.

Located in the galactic halo, it was noted to lie on the same plane as the Large Magellanic Cloud and the possibility has been raised that it might be an escaped object from that galaxy.|$|E
5|$|IC 410, a faint nebula, is {{accompanied}} by the bright open cluster NGC 1893. The <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> thin, with a diameter of 12 arcminutes and a population of approximately 20 stars. Its accompanying nebula has very low surface brightness, partially because of its diameter of 40 arcminutes. It appears in an amateur telescope with brighter areas {{in the north and}} south; the brighter southern patch shows a pattern of darker and lighter spots in a large instrument. NGC 1893, of magnitude 7.5, is classified as a Trumpler Class II 3 r n or II 2 m n cluster, meaning that it is not very large and is somewhat bright. The cluster possesses approximately 30 stars of magnitude 9–12. In an amateur instrument, IC 410 is only visible with an Oxygen-III filter. NGC 2281 is a small open cluster at a distance of 1,500 light-years. It contains 30 stars in a crescent shape. It has an overall magnitude of 5.4 and a fairly large diameter of 14.0 arcseconds, classified as a Trumpler Class I 3 m cluster. The brightest star in the <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> magnitude 8; there are approximately 12 stars of magnitude 9–10 and 20 stars of magnitude 11–13.|$|E

5|$|M53 (NGC 5024) is a {{globular}} cluster which was discovered independently by Johann Elert Bode in 1775 and Charles Messier in February 1777; William Herschel {{was the first}} to resolve it into stars. The magnitude-7.7 <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> 56,000 light-years from Earth. Only 1° away is NGC 5053, a {{globular cluster}} with a sparser nucleus of stars. Its total luminosity is the equivalent of about 16,000 suns, one of the lowest luminosities of any globular cluster. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784. NGC 4147 is a somewhat dimmer globular cluster, with a much-smaller apparent size.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} half-light radius {{includes}} {{stars in the}} outer part of the cluster that happen to lie {{along the line of}} sight, so theorists will also use the half-mass radius (r'm)—the radius from the core that contains half the total mass of the cluster. When the half-mass radius of a <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> small relative to the overall size, it has a dense core. An example of this is Messier 3 (M3), which has an overall visible dimension of about 18 arc minutes, but a half-mass radius of only 1.12 arc minutes.|$|E

While, by definition, the notes that form a cluster must sound at the same time, there is no requirement that they must all begin sounding at the same moment. For example, in R. Murray Schafer's choral Epitaph for Moonlight (1968), a tone <b>cluster</b> <b>is</b> constructed by dividing each choir section (soprano/alto/tenor/bass) into four parts.

5|$|On {{the largest}} scale, the Universe is {{continually}} expanding, {{resulting in an}} average increase in the separation between individual galaxies (see Hubble's law). Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These associations formed early in the Universe, as clumps of dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters. This on-going merger process (as well as an influx of infalling gas) heats the inter-galactic gas within a cluster to very high temperatures, reaching 30–100 megakelvins.
