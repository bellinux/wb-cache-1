While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. Cherrill waved {{and asked if she}} would ever get the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> him. After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin {{eventually}} invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness, and Cherrill signed a contract on November 1, 1928.|$|E
5|$|McQuarrie wrote nine {{drafts of}} his {{screenplay}} over five months, until Singer {{felt that it}} was ready to shop around to the studios. None were interested except for a European financing company. McQuarrie and Singer had a difficult time getting the film made because of the non-linear story, the large amount of dialogue and the lack of cast attached to the project. Financiers wanted established stars, and offers for the small role of Redfoot (the L.A. fence who hooks up the five protagonists with Kobayashi) went out to Christopher Walken, Tommy Lee Jones, Jeff Bridges, Charlie Sheen, James Spader, Al Pacino and Johnny Cash. However, the European money allowed the film's producers to make offers to actors and assemble a cast. They were only able to offer the actors salaries that were well below their usual pay, but they agreed because of the quality of McQuarrie's script and the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> each other. That money fell through, however, and Singer used the script and the cast to attract PolyGram to pick up the film negative.|$|E

He chose the squad number 16, due to the fact he often wore it when on international duty, and later claimed he never wanted to leave Liverpool but that the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> André Villas-Boas, with whom he had spent a short period of time at Porto, was too good an opportunity to turn down.|$|E

She is on the live recording of the Vienna State Opera's production of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde for Deutsche Grammophon (2003). In a 2001 interview with Associated Press, however, Voigt expressed that she was unlucky with recording because of unexpected cancellations and postponements. The opportunities of cooperation with high profile musicians could have made her a major prima donna more quickly. She had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti in a televised production of Verdi's La forza del destino in 1997. However, the performance did not take place since Pavarotti had not learned the role of Alvaro and another opera was substituted. Later the same year, Voigt was cast to sing for a new recording of Tristan und Isolde under the direction of Sir Georg Solti. Before it proceeded, Solti suddenly died of a heart attack.|$|E
25|$|By 1982, Peckinpah's {{health was}} poor. Producers Peter S. Davis and William N. Panzer were undaunted, as {{they felt that}} having Peckinpah's name {{attached}} to The Osterman Weekend (1983) would lend the suspense thriller an air of respectability. Peckinpah accepted the job but reportedly hated the convoluted screenplay based upon Robert Ludlum's novel, which he also disliked. Multiple actors in Hollywood auditioned for the film, intrigued by the opportunity. Many of those who signed on, including John Hurt, Burt Lancaster and Dennis Hopper, did so for less than their usual salaries for a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the legendary director. By the time shooting wrapped in January 1983 in Los Angeles, Peckinpah and the producers were hardly speaking. Nevertheless, Peckinpah brought the film in on time and on budget, delivering his director's cut to the producers. Davis and Panzer were unhappy with Peckinpah's version, which included an opening sequence of two characters making love. The producers changed the opening and also deleted other scenes they deemed unnecessary. The Osterman Weekend had some effective action sequences and some strong supporting performances, but Peckinpah's final film was critically panned. It grossed $6 million in the United States and did well in Europe and on the new home-video market.|$|E

He also played the ondes Martenot (an early electronic instrument), improvising accompaniments to radio dramas and occasionally deputising {{in the pit}} orchestra of the Folies Bergère. In early 1946 the actor and director Jean-Louis Barrault needed someone to play the instrument for a production of Hamlet for the new company he and his wife, Madeleine Renaud, had formed. Honegger suggested Boulez. He was soon appointed Music Director of the Compagnie Renaud-Barrault, a post he held for nine years. He arranged and conducted incidental music, mostly by composers {{with whom he had}} little affinity (such as Milhaud and Tchaikovsky), but it gave him the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> professional musicians, whilst leaving him time to compose during the day. It also broadened his horizons: in 1947 the company toured to Belgium and Switzerland ("absolutely pays de cocagne , my first discovery of the big world"); in 1948 they took their production of Hamlet to the second Edinburgh International Festival; in 1951 they gave a season of plays at St James's Theatre in London at the invitation of Laurence Olivier; and between 1950 and 1957 there were three tours to South America and two to North America.

After writer Ken Keeler {{was assigned}} to write an episode featuring Sideshow Bob, he drew inspiration from episodes of Frasier. He decided to incorporate elements of Grammer's other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and designed Cecil to resemble Grammer's brother on Frasier. Cecil is voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who portrayed Frasier Crane's brother Niles. Pierce commented, [...] "Normally, I would not do something like this. But {{how often do you}} get a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?"

In Frasier, Maris Crane is an unseen character, and the producers of Frasier asked that the scene be removed. Many of the interactions between Bob and Cecil were based on those of Niles and Frasier. Cecil was drawn to resemble David Hyde Pierce, while retaining a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob.
