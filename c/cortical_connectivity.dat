The proposed system {{is based on an}} EEG-based dynamic neu-roimaging system, which is capable of monitoring spatio-temporal changes of cortical rhythmic activity at a specific frequency band by conducting real-time cortical source imaging. To verify the implemented system, we performed three test experiments in which we monitored temporal changes in <b>cortical</b> functional <b>connectivity</b> patterns in various frequency bands during structural face processing, finger movements, and working memory task. We also traced the changes in the number of connections between all possible pairs of ROIs whose correlations exceeded a predetermined threshold.

40|$|By {{employing}} {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS) {{in combination}} with high-density electroencephalography (EEG), we recently reported that <b>cortical</b> effective <b>connectivity</b> is disrupted during early non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. This {{is a time when}} subjects, if awakened, may report little or no conscious content. We hypothesized that a similar breakdown of <b>cortical</b> effective <b>connectivity</b> may underlie loss of consciousness (LOC) induced by pharmacologic agents. Here, we tested this hypothesis by comparing EEG responses to TMS during wakefulness and LOC induced by the benzodiazepine midazolam. Unlike spontaneous sleep states, a subject’s level of vigilance can be monitored repeatedly during pharmacological LOC. We found that, unlike during wakefulness, wherein TMS triggered responses in multiple cortical areas lasting for > 300 ms, during midazolam-induced LOC, TMS-evoked activity was local and of shorter duration. Furthermore, a measure of the propagation of evoked cortical currents (significant current scattering, SCS) could reliably discriminate between consciousness and LOC. These results resemble those observed in early NREM sleep and suggest that a breakdown of <b>cortical</b> effective <b>connectivity</b> may be a common feature of conditions characterized by LOC. Moreover, these results suggest that {{it might be possible to}} use TMS-EEG to assess consciousness during anesthesia and in pathological conditions, such as coma, vegetative state, and minimally conscious state...|$|R
40|$|The {{brain is}} highly energy consuming, {{therefore}} is under strong selective pressure to achieve cost-efficiency in both <b>cortical</b> <b>connectivities</b> and activities. However, cost-efficiency as a design principle for cortical activities has been rarely studied. Especially {{it is not}} clear how cost-efficiency is related to ubiquitously observed multi-scale properties: irregular firing, oscillations and neuronal avalanches. Here we demonstrate that these prominent properties can be simultaneously observed in a generic, biologically plausible neural circuit model that captures excitation-inhibition balance and realistic dynamics of synaptic conductance. Their co-emergence achieves minimal energy cost as well as maximal energy efficiency on information capacity, when neuronal firing are coordinated and shaped by moderate synchrony to reduce otherwise redundant spikes, and the dynamical clusterings are maintained in the form of neuronal avalanches. Such cost-efficient neural dynamics can be employed as a foundation for further efficient information processing under energy constraint...|$|R

(2007) {{constructed}} a connection matrix from fiber densities measured between homogeneously distributed and equal-sized regions of interest (ROIs) numbering between 500 and 4000. A quantitative analysis of connection matrices obtained for approximately 1000 ROIs and approximately 50,000 fiber pathways from two subjects demonstrated an exponential (one-scale) degree distribution {{as well as}} robust small-world attributes for the network. The data sets were derived from diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) (Wedeen, 2005), a variant of diffusion-weighted imaging that is sensitive to intra-voxel heterogeneities in diffusion directions caused by crossing fiber tracts and thus allows more accurate mapping of axonal trajectories than other diffusion imaging approaches (Wedeen, 2008).The combination of whole-head DSI datasets acquired and processed according to the approach developed by Hagmann et al.

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} the electroencephalogram in children who emerged with emergence delirium (ED) compared with children without ED using methods that involved the assessment of <b>cortical</b> functional <b>connectivity.</b> Methods: Children aged 5 to 15 yr had multichannel electroencephalographic recordings during induction and emergence from anesthesia during minor surgical procedures. Of these, five children displayed ED after sevoflurane anesthesia. Measures of <b>cortical</b> functional <b>connectivity</b> previously used to evaluate anesthetic action in adults were compared between ED and age-, sex-, and anesthetic-matched non-ED children during emergence from anesthesia. Results: At the termination of sevoflurane anesthesia, the electroencephalogram in both ED and control patients showed delta frequency slowing and frontally dominant alpha activity, followed by a prolonged state with low-voltage, fast frequency activity (referred to as an indeterminate state). In children with ED, arousal with delirious behavior {{and a variety of}} electroencephalogram patterns occurred during the indeterminate state, before the appearance of normal wake or sleep patterns. The electroencephalogram in children without ED progressed from the indeterminate state to classifiable sleep or drowsy states, before peaceful awakening. Statistically significant differences in frontal lobe functional connectivity were identified between children with ED and non-ED. Conclusions: ED is associated with arousal from an indeterminate state before the onset of sleep-like electroencephalogram patterns. Increased frontal lobe <b>cortical</b> functional <b>connectivity</b> observed in ED, immediately after the termination of sevoflurane anesthesia, will have important implications for the development of methods to predict ED, the design of preventative strategies, and efforts to better understand its pathophysiology...|$|R
40|$|As an {{indicator}} of synchronous neural activity, resting-state functional networks are influenced by neuropathological and neurochemical changes in degenerative diseases. To further advance understanding about neurochemical and neuropathological basis for resting-state functional maps, we performed a comparative analysis of resting-state functional connectivity in patients with Parkinson&# 39;s disease (PD) and drug induced parkinsonism (DIP). Resting-state neuroimaging data were analyzed with a seed-based approach to investigate striatocortical functional <b>connectivity</b> and <b>cortical</b> functional <b>connectivity</b> within the default mode network, executive control network, and the dorsal attention network. The striatal subregions were divided into the more or less affected sides in terms of dopamine transporter uptake. Compared with DIP, PD exhibited an increased cerebellar connectivity from the more affected side of the caudate and the less affected sides of the anterior and the posterior putamen. Additionally, PD showed increased functional connectivity in the anterior prefrontal areas from the more affected side of the anterior putamen and from the less affected side of the posterior putamen. However, PD exhibited decreased <b>cortical</b> functional <b>connectivity</b> from the posterior cingulate cortex in the left temporal area. Finally, DIP patients showed decreased <b>cortical</b> functional <b>connectivity</b> from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in frontal and parietal areas compared with PD patients. In summary, the present study demonstrates that PD patients exhibited a unique resting state functional connectivity that {{may be associated with}} PD-related pathological changes beyond the dopaminergic system, whereas DIP patients showed altered functional connectivity within executive control network.

We attributed the pattern to arousal-related cardiovascular changes overruling cerebral autoregulation thereby masking specific signal changes elicited by local neuronal activity. To {{rule out the possibility that}} interhemispheric neuronal communication might contribute to bilateral {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} responses, we compared stimulus-evoked functional magnetic resonance imaging responses to unilateral hindpaw stimulation in acallosal I/LnJ, C 57 BL/ 6, and BALB/c mice.

5000|$|Sign {{language}} {{refers to}} a mode of communication, distinct from spoken languages, which uses visual gestures with the hands accompanied by body language to express meaning. It has been determined that the brain's left side is the dominant side utilized for producing and understanding sign language, {{just as it is}} for speech. In 1861, Paul Broca studied patients with the ability to understand spoken languages but the inability to produce them. The damaged area was named Broca's area, and located in the left hemisphere’s inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann areas 44, 45). Soon after, in 1874, Carl Wernicke studied patients with the reverse deficits: patients could produce spoken language, but could not comprehend it. The damaged area was named Wernicke's area, and is located in the left hemisphere’s posterior superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann area 22). Signers with damage in Broca's area, have problems producing signs. Those with damage in the Wernicke's area (left hemisphere) in the temporal lobe of the brain have problems comprehending signed languages. Early on, it was noted that Broca’s area was near the part of the motor cortex controlling the face and mouth. Likewise, Wernicke's area was near the auditory cortex. These motor and auditory areas are important in spoken language processing and production, but the connection to signed languages had yet to be uncovered. For this reason, the left hemisphere was described as the verbal hemisphere, with the right hemisphere deemed to be responsible for spatial tasks. This criteria and classification was used to denounce signed languages as equal with their spoken counterparts before it was more widely agreed upon that due to the similarities in <b>cortical</b> <b>connectivity</b> they are linguistically and cognitively equivalent. In the 1980's research on deaf patients with left hemisphere stroke were examined to explore the brains connection with signed languages. The left perisylvian region was discovered to be functionally critical for language, spoken and signed. Its location near several key auditory processing regions led to the belief that language processing required auditory input and was used to discredit signed languages as [...] "real languages." [...] This research opened the doorway for linguistic analysis and further research of signed languages. Signed languages, like spoken languages, are highly structured linguistic system; they have their own sets of phonological, morphological and syntactic characteristics. Despite complex differences between spoken and signed languages, the associated brain areas are thus far thought to share a lot in common.|$|E

Low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was used to compute intracortical source model-based lagged functional connectivity not biased by volume conduction effects between 19 cortical regions of interest (ROIs).

40|$|Long-range <b>cortical</b> {{functional}} <b>connectivity</b> {{is often}} reduced in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but {{the nature of}} local <b>cortical</b> functional <b>connectivity</b> in ASD has remained elusive. We used magnetoencephalography to measure task-related local functional connectivity, as manifested by coupling between the phase of alpha oscillations and the amplitude of gamma oscillations, in the fusiform face area (FFA) of individuals diagnosed with ASD and typically developing individuals while they viewed neutral faces, emotional faces, and houses. We also measured task-related long-range functional connectivity between the FFA {{and the rest of}} the cortex during the same paradigm. In agreement with earlier studies, long-range functional connectivity between the FFA and three distant cortical regions was reduced in the ASD group. However, contrary to the prevailing hypothesis in the field, we found that local functional connectivity within the FFA was also reduced in individuals with ASD when viewing faces. Furthermore, the strength of long-range functional connectivity was directly correlated to the strength of local functional connectivity in both groups; thus, long-range and local connectivity were reduced proportionally in the ASD group. Finally, the magnitude of local functional connectivity correlated with ASD severity, and statistical classification using local and long-range functional connectivity data identified ASD diagnosis with 90 % accuracy. These results suggest that failure to entrain neuronal assemblies fully both within and across cortical regions may be characteristic of ASD.

Anatomical and physiological investigations in non-human primates have demonstrated that these regions have differing patterns of <b>cortical</b> <b>connectivity</b> and distinctive neuronal responses. Brain-imaging techniques and lesion studies have begun to probe the functions of homologous regions in humans...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} study to apply EEG {{coherence}} analysis {{to the study of}} Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). EEG coherence is argued to be an objective measure of <b>cortical</b> <b>connectivity.</b> Five DID patients were compared to five controls, who were professional actors. Fifteen dissociated DID alter states were studied, as were 15 “alters” simulated by the actor control participants. Comparisons of EEG coherence were made between DID participants and controls. Significant differences in EEG coherence were found in comparing DID host and alter personalities, with coherence found to be lower in the alter personalities. No significant differences were found in comparing DID host personalities and controls. The acted alters matched for age and gender, showed no significant differences in coherence compared to DID alter personalities. The results indicate that EEG coherence may be an objective measure of the neuronal <b>cortical</b> <b>connectivity</b> associated with DID...|$|E
40|$|Current {{theories}} {{hold that}} brain function is highly related to long-range physical connections through axonal bundles, namely extrinsic connectiv-ity. However, obtaining a groupwise cortical parcellation based on extrinsic connectivity remains challenging. Current parcellation methods are compu-tationally expensive; need tuning of several parameters or rely on ad-hoc constraints. Furthermore, {{none of these}} methods present {{a model for the}} <b>cortical</b> extrinsic <b>connectivity</b> of the cortex. To tackle these problems, we propose a parsimonious model for the extrinsic connectivity and an efficient parceling technique based on clustering of tractograms. Our technique allows the creation of single subject and groupwise parcellations of the whole cortex. The parcellations obtained with our technique are in agreement with structural and functional parcellations in the literature. In particular, the motor and sensory cortex are subdivided in agreement with the human ho-munculus of Penfield. We illustrate this by comparing our resulting parcels with the motor strip mapping included in the Human Connectome Project data...|$|R
5000|$|... eConnectome (Electrophysiological Connectome) is an {{open-source}} MATLAB toolbox with graphical {{user interfaces}} for mapping and imaging brain functional connectivity at both the scalp and cortical levels from electrophysiological signals including electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG). Major functions of the eConnectome include EEG/ECoG preprocessing, scalp/cortical potential mapping, <b>cortical</b> source estimation, <b>connectivity</b> analysis and visualization. Granger causality measures including Directed Transfer Function (DTF) and Adaptive Directed Transfer Function (ADTF) {{can be used to}} estimate the directional interactions of brain functional networks.

40|$|Whole-brain voxel-based {{unbiased}} resting state functional connectivity was analysed in 418 {{subjects with}} autism and 509 matched typically developing individuals. We identified a key {{system in the}} middle temporal gyrus/superior temporal sulcus region that has reduced <b>cortical</b> functional <b>connectivity</b> (and increased with the medial thalamus), which is implicated in face expression processing involved in social behaviour. This system has reduced functional connectivity with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which is implicated in emotion and social communication. The middle temporal gyrus system is also implicated in theory of mind processing. We also identified in autism a second key system in the precuneus/superior parietal lobule region with reduced functional connectivity, which is implicated in spatial functions including of oneself, and of the spatial environment. It is proposed that {{these two types of}} functionality, face expression-related, and of one’s self and the environment, are important components of the computations involved in theory of mind, whether of oneself or of others, and that reduced connectivity within and between these regions may make a major contribution to the symptoms of autism...|$|R
