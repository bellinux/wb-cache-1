25|$|The {{condition}} that γ'A(λ) ≤ μ'A(λ) can be proven by considering a particular eigenvalue ξ of A and diagonalizing the first γ'A(ξ) columns of A {{with respect to}} the eigenvectors of ξ, described in a later section. The resulting similar matrix B is block upper triangular, with its top left block being the diagonal matrix ξI'γ'A(ξ). As a result, the <b>characteristic</b> <b>polynomial</b> <b>of</b> B will have a factor of (ξ−λ)γ'A(ξ). The other factors of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>polynomial</b> <b>of</b> B are not known, so the algebraic multiplicity of ξ as an eigenvalue of B is no less than the geometric multiplicity of ξ as an eigenvalue of A. The last element of the proof is the property that similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial.|$|E
