The valley widens as the river nears its mouth, so the <b>central</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> of the city forms a triangle with its longest side along the shoreline.

25|$|Hastings District {{encompasses}} {{a large area}} of Hawke's Bay. The population of Hastings District is 77,400 (population density 15.0 per km2). The <b>central</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> however which is specifically the population centre of Hastings, Flaxmere, and Havelock North is around 73,000. Due to restrictions on encroachment of land, satellite suburbs have absorbed the residential expansion of the city. Compared to other cities of similar size, Hastings has grown relatively quick since it was settled in 1864 (over 150 years ago). Hastings {{is known for its}} gridiron city planning system, crisscrossed by the railway line running northeast–southwest and the main southeast–northwest artery, Heretaunga Street, which also links the city with its suburban centres of Havelock North and Flaxmere.|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} pattern of hospitals in Wuhan indicates a core in the <b>central</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> and a sparse {{distribution in the}} suburbs, particularly {{at the center of}} suburbs. This study aims to improve the gravity and Huff models to analyze healthcare accessibility and resources. Results indicate that healthcare accessibility in <b>central</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas</b> is better than in the suburbs, where it increasingly worsens for the suburbs. A shortage of healthcare resources is observed in large-scale and high-class hospitals in <b>central</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas,</b> whereas the resources of some hospitals in the suburbs are redundant. This study proposes the multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) analysis model for the location assessment in constructing new hospitals, which can effectively ameliorate healthcare accessibility in suburban areas. This study presents implications for the planning of urban healthcare facilities...|$|R

[...] In AD1115 Aguda established Jin's capital Shangjing (Upper Capital) Huining Prefecture in today's Acheng District of Harbin. After Aguda's death, the new emperor Wanyan Sheng ordered {{the construction of a new}} city on a uniform plan. The planning and construction emulated major Chinese cities, in particular Bianjing (Kaifeng), although the Jin capital was smaller than its Northern Song prototype. Huining Prefecture served as the first superior capital of the Jin empire until Wanyan Liang (the fourth emperor of Jin Dynasty) moved the capital to Yanjing (now Beijing) in 1153. Liang even went so far as to destroy all palaces in his former capital in 1157. Wanyan Liang's successor Wanyan Yong (Emperor Shizong) restored the city and established it as a secondary capital in 1173. Ruins of the Shangjing Huining Prefecture were discovered and excavated about 2km from present-day Acheng's <b>central</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area.</b> The site of the old Jin capital ruins is a national historic reserve, and includes the [...] The museum, open to the public, was renovated in late 2005.
