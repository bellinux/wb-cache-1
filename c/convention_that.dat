Jones, who was later known for the mass murder and suicide at Jonestown in November 1978, {{organized}} a religious <b>convention</b> <b>that</b> took place June 11 through June 15, 1956, at Cadle Tabernacle in Indianapolis.

5|$|Naylor had scouted Australia {{to get an}} idea of {{locations}} and finance costs, with pre-production beginning in 2004 and filming planned for 2005. However, finding sufficient funding has been difficult. Naylor explained at a Red Dwarf Dimension Jump <b>convention</b> <b>that</b> the film had been rejected by the BBC and the British Film Council. Reasons given for the rejections were that while the script was considered to be funny, it was not ready.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, Breckinridge quickly became an ardent supporter of the Union, not for its position against slavery, but for the sake of preserving the Union. He used his position as editor of the Danville Quarterly Review to advocate his position. He called for harsh measures against secession, and in time, accepted President Lincoln's immediate emancipation of slaves. He was chosen as the temporary chair of the 1864 Republican National <b>Convention</b> <b>that</b> re-nominated Lincoln for president, and his pro-Union speech was hailed by freshman Representative James G. Blaine {{as one of the most}} inspiring given at the event.|$|E
5|$|Bradley's {{election}} in 1895 had {{marked the first}} time in Kentucky's history that the Commonwealth had elected a Republican governor. Angry Democrats, who had controlled the governorship since the fall of the Whig Party, sought to regain what they had lost. Bitter divisions in the party led to a contentious <b>convention</b> <b>that</b> nominated William Goebel as the party candidate. A faction of the Democratic Party held a second nominating convention and chose former governor John Y. Brown as their nominee.|$|E
5|$|Buckner had a keen {{interest}} in politics and friends had been urging him to run for governor since 1867, even while terms of his surrender confined him to Louisiana. Unwilling to violate these terms, he instructed a friend to withdraw his name from consideration if it was presented. In 1868, he was a delegate to the Democratic National <b>Convention</b> <b>that</b> nominated Horatio Seymour for president. Though Buckner had favored George H. Pendleton, he loyally supported the party's nominee throughout the campaign.|$|E

5|$|Despite their successes, {{these three}} dissenters grew {{increasingly}} unpopular as most other delegates {{wanted to bring}} the Convention's business {{to an end and}} return home. As the Convention was drawing to a conclusion, and delegates prepared to refer the Constitution to the Committee on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an objection over civil trials. He wanted to guarantee the right to a jury trial in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity. Mason told the <b>Convention</b> <b>that</b> the constitution should include a bill of rights, which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them. They wanted to go home, and thought this was nothing more than another delaying tactic.|$|E
5|$|George {{inherited}} the throne at a politically turbulent time. Lloyd George's People's Budget had been rejected {{the previous year}} by the Conservative and Unionist-dominated House of Lords, contrary to the normal <b>convention</b> <b>that</b> the Lords did not veto money bills. Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith had asked the previous king to give an undertaking that he would create sufficient Liberal peers to force the budget through the House. Edward had reluctantly agreed, provided the Lords rejected the budget after two successive general elections. After a general election in January 1910, the Conservative peers allowed the budget, for which the government now had an electoral mandate, to pass without a vote.|$|E
5|$|Going {{against the}} normal <b>convention</b> <b>that</b> the strongest {{characters}} {{should be the}} largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of Dragon Balls most powerful characters, including Goku, with small statures. Toriyama explained that he had Goku grow up so that drawing fight scenes would be easier, even though Torishima was against it initially because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically. Torishima later referred to this as his own biggest crisis during the series, with Toriyama threatening to end it if Goku could not grow up. The editor said his concerns were unfounded, as readers accepted the change without complaint.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, Maine Republicans {{refused to}} pass more anti-alcohol legislation, and Dow quit {{the party to}} join the Prohibitionists; he {{instantly}} became the party's most prominent member. His friend and ally James Black requested that Dow's name be placed in nomination for the presidency at the 1880 convention, to which Dow agreed. The <b>convention</b> <b>that</b> met in Cleveland that June welcomed delegates from twelve states, but attracted almost no attention from the press. Dow himself did not attend, staying home with his ailing wife (candidates for a party's nomination often did not attend conventions in person at that time). He was nominated, heading a ticket with vice-presidential nominee Henry A. Thompson of Ohio.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011, Williams {{publicly}} campaigned with Vaughn Granter, {{who was the}} PC Candidate in Williams' former {{district of}} Humber West.

The tribute dinner was to be held in conjunction with the leadership <b>convention</b> <b>that</b> would swear Dunderdale in as PC leader. Following this, Williams announced that Premier Dunderdale and her staff were distancing themselves from him.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln did {{not stay}} long, and soon {{returned}} to Northampton, where {{he passed the}} bar. He established a practice in Worcester in 1775, where his business flourished {{because most of the}} Worcester lawyers had been Loyalist and had fled to Boston. From 1775 to 1781, he served as clerk of the court and probate judge of Worcester County, and served the town of Worcester in a variety of posts into the 1790s. He was elected in 1779 to the state <b>convention</b> <b>that</b> drafted the state constitution. During these years, Lincoln rose in prominence {{to become one of the}} largest landowners in Worcester. He was a charter member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.|$|E

5|$|Morehead was a {{delegate}} to the Peace Conference of 1861 and the Border States <b>Convention</b> <b>that</b> attempted {{to stave off the}} Civil War. Although he favored Kentucky's neutrality, Morehead sympathized with the South and was an open critic of the Lincoln administration. He was imprisoned for disloyalty in September 1861, although no formal charges were ever brought against him. He was released from prison in January 1862, and afterward fled to Canada, Europe, and Mexico. After the war, he returned to the United States and settled on his plantation in Greenville, Mississippi, where he died on December 21, 1868.|$|E
5|$|Shelby {{began working}} to secure Kentucky's {{separation}} from Virginia {{as early as}} 1784. That year, he attended a convention to consider leading an expedition against the Indians and separating Kentucky from Virginia. He was a delegate to subsequent conventions in 1787, 1788, and 1789 that worked toward a constitution for Kentucky. During these conventions he helped thwart James Wilkinson's scheme to align Kentucky with the Spanish. In 1791 Shelby, Charles Scott and Benjamin Logan were among those chosen by the Virginia legislature {{to serve on the}} Board of War for the district of Kentucky. Shelby was also made High Sheriff on Lincoln County. In 1792, he was a delegate to the final <b>convention</b> <b>that</b> framed the first Kentucky Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in Covington, Stevenson was elected county attorney for Kenton County. He was chosen as a delegate to the 1844 Democratic National Convention and was elected to represent Kenton County in the Kentucky House of Representatives the following year. He was reelected in 1846 and 1848. In 1849, he was chosen as a delegate to the state constitutional <b>convention</b> <b>that</b> produced Kentucky's third state constitution. In 1850, he, Madison C. Johnson, and James Harlan were appointed as commissioners to revise Kentucky's civic and criminal code. Their work, Code of Practise in Civil and Criminal Cases was published in 1854.
