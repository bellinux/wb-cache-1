40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{availability}} of an alternative reinforcer on responding maintained by food pellets or fluid solutions were examined in 6 adult male baboons (Papio cynocephalus anubis). During daily 23 -hr experimental sessions, baboons had concurrent access to both food pellets and fluid, with responding maintained under fixed-ratio schedules of reinforcement that varied between the two commodities. The fixed-ratio requirement, or cost, for pellets was increased when (a) no fluid, (b) a dilute dextrose vehicle, (c) 0. 002 mg/kg d-amphetamine, or (d) 0. 004 mg/kg d-amphetamine was available. When given nonrestricted concurrent access to food pellets and amphetamine at minimal cost (FR 2), baboons self-administered sufficient amphetamine to decrease pellet intake. Increasing the response requirement for pellets decreased pellet intake at a similar rate regardless of the available fluid and increased fluid intake in a variable manner among baboons such that there were no statistically significant increases in fluid intake. In contrast, when access to pellets was restricted to 70 % of maximal intake under nonrestricted conditions, increasing pellet cost decreased pellet intake and increased fluid intake more rapidly when the high amphetamine dose was available. Thus, amphetamine was more effective as an economic substitute for pellets when access to pellets was restricted. The response cost for vehicle and both amphetamine concentrations was increased when baboons had nonrestricted and restricted access to pellets. Increasing the response requirement for fluid delivery decreased intake of all three fluids similarly under both pellet-access conditions. The results indicate that substitution between commodities with minimal commonalities can be studied under controlled laboratory conditions and is dependent upon reinforcement schedule and <b>commodity</b> <b>restrictions...</b>|$|E

50|$|Russia's {{systems for}} {{agricultural}} production influenced {{the attitudes of}} peasants and other social groups to reform against the government and promote social changes. “At {{the beginning of the}} twentieth century, agriculture constituted the single largest sector of the Russian economy, producing approximately one-half of the national income and employing two-thirds of Russia’s population”. This illustrates the tremendous role peasants played economically; thus making them detrimental to the revolutionary ideology of the populist and social democrats. At the end of the 19th century, Russian agriculture as a whole was the worst in Europe. The Russian system of agriculture lacked capital investment and technological advancement. Livestock productivity was notoriously backwards and the lack of grazing land such as meadows forced livestock to graze in fallow uncultivated land. Both the crop and livestock system failed to be adequate to withstand the Russian winters. During the Tsarist rule, the agricultural economy diverged from subsistence production to production directly for the market. Along with the agricultural failures, Russia had a rapid population growth, railroads expanded across farmland, and inflation attacked the price of <b>commodities.</b> <b>Restrictions</b> were placed on the distribution of food and ultimately lead to famines. Agricultural difficulties in Russia limited the economy, influencing social reforms and assisting the rise of the Bolshevik party.|$|R

We find that neither finite transactions costs in the goods markets nor minimum levels of subsistence consumption can explain the observed bias in international portfolios towards domestic equities. In contrast, {{in the presence of}} non-traded goods the optimal portfolio as a whole exhibits a substantial bias towards domestic equities, and a simple calibration exercise shows that the degree of bias exhibited by the international portfolio in the theoretical model is of similar magnitude to that observed in the data. However, at the sectoral level the pattern is not satisfactory. The combined model, with transaction costs for all goods, does not generate pervasive home bias either...|$|R

40|$|Whilst {{the laws}} {{affecting}} property {{in these countries}} have wisely given to every one an unrestricted power of disposal over the property of his own creation, they have, at the same time, indirectly interfered with that privilege in practice, by throwing obstacles {{in the way of}} the alienation of land, injurious alike to the owner or debtor, and his creditor. As the power of transferableness forms one of the elements of the value of a <b>commodity,</b> any <b>restriction</b> on that power is a diminution of its value to the owner; whilst his creditor, from the period that he became entitled to claim the property, by advancing his money, his labour, or his goods, is injured in proportion to the delay and expense attendant upon its alienation. In considering, therefore, economically, the laws that affect the transfer of land, I propose to review them not only as they affect the possessor or the debtor, but also his creditor; and will endeavour to establish that whilst mortgages and charges created by the owner should be the only permanent incumbrances upon land, yet that it will not be incompatible with the speedy transfer and improvement of real property, that it should be liable to the claims of judgment creditors...|$|R

40|$|Cameroon and Indonesia are two {{countries}} that have received much attention {{in the literature on}} tropical deforestation. Both have also experienced devastating economic crises and subsequent macroeconomic adjustment policies. Through a contrast of the {{two countries}}' experiences, this chapter explores the effect of such economic events on small farmers and their forest management practices, and the subsequent effects on tropical forest cover. In both countries, economic crises led to changes in farming systems and to {{a significant increase in the}} rate of forest clearing, yet the circumstances leading to this outcome are strikingly different. In Cameroon, a collapse of the prices of leading agroexport commodities (cocoa and coffee), withdrawal of government subsidies for these <b>commodities,</b> and <b>restrictions</b> on food imports made farmer’s clear land to produce food crops for domestic consumption. In Indonesia, a drastic depreciation of the national currency against the USD made certain agroexport commodities profitable, with the consequence that many farmers cleared land to produce these crops. There are three main lessons to be drawn from a comparison of the two countries' experiences. First, opposite forms of macroeconomic destabilization (i. e. decrease or increase of agroexport prices) can lead to the same forest cover consequences. Second, this suggests that increased rates of forest clearing have more to do with destabilization, in and of itself, rather than with the direction of change in farm commodity prices. Third, policymakers should be aware of the ways in which widely differing economic shocks and macroeconomic adjustment policies can lead to unexpected, and in some cases undesirable social and environmental consequences...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} capacitated warehouse location problem {{consists of}} determining the number {{and the location of}} capacitated warehouses on a predefined set of potential sites such that the demands of a set of customers are met. A very common assumption made in modeling this problem in almost all of the existing research is that the total capacity of all potential warehouses is sufficient to meet the total demand. Whereas this assumption facilitates to define a well-structured problem from the mathematical modeling perspective, it is in fact restrictive, not realistic, and hence rarely held in practice. The modeling approach presented in this paper breaks away from the existing research in relaxing this very restrictive assumption. This paper therefore investigates the generalized problem of locating warehouses in a supply chain setting with multiple <b>commodities</b> with no <b>restriction</b> on the total capacity and the demand. A new integer programming formulation for this problem is presented, and an algorithm based on Lagrangean relaxation and decomposition is described for its solution. Three Lagrangean heuristics are proposed. Computational results indicate that reasonably good solutions can be obtained with the proposed algorithms, without having to use a general purpose optimizer...|$|R

The paper provides a broad overview of the explanations for sub-Saharan Africa’s unsatisfactory growth performance in the past, paying particular attention to the empirical literature.

40|$|The {{literature}} on k-splittable flows, see Baier et al. (2002), provides evidence on how controlling {{the number of}} used paths enables practical applications of flows optimization in many real-world contexts. Such a modeling feature has never been integrated so far in Quickest Flows, a class of optimization problems suitable to cope with situations such as emergency evacuations, transportation planning and telecommunication systems, where one aims to minimize the makespan, i. e. the overall time needed to complete all the operations, see Pascoal et al. (2006). In order to bridge this gap, a novel optimization problem, the Quickest Multicommodity k-Splittable Flow Problem (QMCkSFP) is introduced in this paper. The problem seeks to minimize the makespan of transshipment operations for given demands of multiple <b>commodities,</b> while imposing <b>restrictions</b> on {{the maximum number of}} paths for each single commodity. The computational complexity of this problem is analyzed, showing its NP-hardness in the strong sense, and an original Mixed-Integer Programming formulation is detailed. We propose a matheuristic algorithm based on a hybridized Very Large-Scale Neighborhood Search that, utilizing the presented mathematical formulation, explores multiple search spaces to solve efficiently large instances of the QMCkSFP. High quality computational results obtained on benchmark test sets are presented and discussed, showing how the proposed matheuristic largely outperforms a state-of-the-art heuristic scheme frequently adopted in path-restricted flow problems...|$|R
60|$|A tax {{on any one}} commodity, whether laid on its production, its importation, its {{carriage}} {{from place}} to place, or its sale, and whether the tax be a fixed sum of money for a given quantity of the commodity, or an ad valorem duty, will, as a general rule, raise the value and price of the commodity by at least {{the amount of the}} tax. There are few cases in which it does not raise them by more than that amount. In the first place, there are few taxes on production on account of which it is not found or deemed necessary to impose restrictive regulations on the manufacturers or dealers, in order to check evasions of the tax. These regulations are always sources of trouble and annoyance, and generally of expense, for all of which, being peculiar disadvantages, the producers or dealers must have compensation in the price of their <b>commodity.</b> These <b>restrictions</b> also frequently interfere with the processes of manufacture, requiring the producer to carry on his operations in the way most convenient to the revenue, though not the cheapest or most efficient for purposes of production. Any regulations whatever, enforced by law, make it difficult for the producer to adopt new and improved processes. Further, the necessity of advancing the tax obliges producers and dealers to carry on their business with larger capitals than would otherwise be necessary, on the whole of which they must receive the ordinary rate of profit, though a part only is employed in defraying the real expenses of production or importation. The price of the article must be such as to afford a profit on more than its natural value, instead of a profit on only its natural value. Neither ought it to be forgotten that whatever renders a larger capital necessary in any trade or business limits the competition in that business, and, by giving something like a monopoly to a few dealers, may enable them either to keep up the price beyond what would afford the ordinary rate of profit, or to obtain the ordinary rate of profit with a less degree of exertion for improving and cheapening their commodity. In these several modes, taxes on commodities often cost to the consumer, through the increased price of the article, much more than they bring into the treasury of the state. There is still another consideration: the higher price necessitated by the tax almost always checks the demand for the commodity; and, since there are many improvements in production which, to make them practicable, require a certain extent of demand, such improvements are obstructed, and many of them prevented altogether. It is a well-known fact that the branches of production in which fewest improvements are made are those with which the revenue-officer interferes; and that nothing, in general, gives a greater impulse to improvements in the production of a commodity than taking off a tax which narrowed the market for it.|$|R
40|$|The export {{performance}} of Sub-Saharan Africa has lagged behind that {{of developing countries}} in other regions {{for the past two}} decades, and total export proceeds have fallen significantly since 1980. Many factors explain this outcome, including continued concentration in slowly-growing non-fuel primary commodities and domestic economic policies that have discouraged new investment that could promote diversification and increased production of traditional crops. Diversification into new agricultural products and light manufactures could boost export earnings, but only if the region can compete successfully with existing producers elsewhere. In most countries this will require major structural reforms to create a more attractive economic environment.

40|$|Tephritid {{fruit flies}} (Diptera: Tephritidae) are {{considered}} {{by far the}} most important group of horticultural pests worldwide. Female fruit flies lay eggs directly into ripening fruit, where the maggots feed causing fruit loss. Each and every continent is plagued by a number of fruit fly pests, both indigenous as well as invasive ones, causing tremendous economic losses. In addition to the direct losses through damage, they can negatively impact <b>commodity</b> trade through <b>restrictions</b> to market access. The quarantine and regulatory controls put in place to manage them are expensive, while the on-farm control costs and loss of crop affect the general well-being of growers. These constraints can have huge implications on loss in revenues and limitations to developing fruit and vegetable-based agroindustries in developing, emergent and developed nations. Because fruit flies are a global problem, the study of their biology and management requires significant international attention to overcome the hurdles they pose. The Joint Food and Agriculture Organisation / International Atomic Energy Agency (FAO/IAEA) Programme on Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture has been on the foreground in assisting Member States in developing and validating environment-friendly fruit fly suppression systems to support viable fresh fruit and vegetable production and export industries. Such international attention has resulted in the successful development and validation of a Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) package for the Mediterranean fruit fly. Although demands for R&D support with respect to Mediterranean fruit fly are diminishing due to successful integration of this package into sustainable control programmes against this pest in many countries, there were increasing demands from Member States in Africa, Asia and Latin America, to address other major fruit fly pests and a related, but sometimes neglected issue of tephritid species complexes of economic importance. Any research, whether it is basic or applied, requires a taxonomic framework that provides reliable and universally recognized entities and names. Among the currently recognized major fruit fly pests, there are groups of species whose morphology is very similar or identical, but biologically they are distinct species. As such, some insect populations that are grouped taxonomically within the same pest species, display different biological and genetic traits and show reproductive isolation which suggest that they are different species. On the other hand, different species may have been taxonomically described, but there may be doubt as to whether they actually represent distinct biological species or merely geographical variants of the same species. This uncertain taxonomic status has practical implications on the effective development and use of the SIT against such complexes, particularly at the time of determining which species to mass-rear, and significantly affects international movement of fruit and vegetables through the establishment of trade barriers to important agricultural commodities which are hosts to these pest tephritid species [...] ...|$|R
