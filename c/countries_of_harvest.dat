40|$|Emissions of {{greenhouse}} gases is accounted for and reported annually under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto protocol. In the current accounting system, emissions of CO 2 from harvested wood products (HWP) are attributed to the year <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> and the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest.</b> All harvested wood is thus assumed to be oxidised to CO 2 in the year <b>of</b> <b>harvesting,</b> and no wood goes into long term storage. This is called the IPCC default approach. Much <b>of</b> the <b>harvested</b> wood will however be stored for a short or {{long period of time}} before it oxidises and this will cause a delayed emission of CO 2. If more wood is stored than oxidised in a given year, harvested wood products will act as a sink and a removal of CO 2 is recorded. However, if the consumption of wood decreases to a level below what is oxidised, harvested wood products will act as a source and emissions of CO 2 is recorded. In Norway, as on many other <b>countries,</b> the stock <b>of</b> <b>harvested</b> wood products has been increasing for many years, and is likely to increase further. Including emissions/removals of CO 2 from harvested wood products in the post Kyoto 2012 regime is under consideration by the UNFCCC, and in that context it is imperative to evaluate estimation models and approaches for the reporting/accounting (IPCC 2006 a) ...|$|R

Our main objective was to test tea infusions and nonpolar extracts prepared from different A. annua varieties against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro in order to determine if synergism will increase the effectiveness of artemisinin in the samples as compared to pure artemisinin. We found that the IC 50 of artemisinin in the tea and nonpolar extracts was not significantly different to the IC 50 of pure artemisinin. We could show that the year and <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>harvest</b> or storage conditions did not have any influence on the activity and that it narrowly followed the concentration of artemisinin in all the extracts. In conclusion, based on these in vitro results, artemisinin seems to be the only active antiplasmodial compound in A. annua. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{sugar cane}} {{industry}} forms {{a significant portion}} of the South African economy, and unlike many other <b>countries</b> the <b>harvesting</b> <b>of</b> sugar cane in South Africa remains manual in nature. The focus of the present study was therefore on the assessment of spinal kinematics (range of motion, velocities and accelerations in all three cardinal planes) during the harvesting process. Eight workers were recruited from the Illovo Esperanza farm in Kwa-zulu Natal as subjects for the study. The experimental protocol was conducted in situ and required subjects to cut the sugar cane using specially modified knives as they would under normal harvesting conditions. The motion performance was quantified using the lumbar motion monitor (LMM), a triaxial electrogoniometer. Results indicate that the <b>harvesting</b> <b>of</b> sugar cane places excessive demands on the spine. During cutting, subjects were required to maintain the spine in a high degree of flexion throughout the task which also demonstrated significant twisting and lateral bending. Of particular concern were the high lateral velocities (ranging between 50 and 90 m. s- 1), as this is a key risk factor in the development of lower back pain. It is evident from these results that new techniques <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> sugar cane are essential to reduce the rate of injury within this industry...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{medicinal}} plants {{is an increasing}} phenomenon among {{the majority of people}} in many developing <b>countries.</b> Some <b>of</b> the <b>harvested</b> {{medicinal plants}} are often stored for shorter or longer periods prior to usage. Evidence from recent studies has demonstrated the pharmacological efficacy of short and long-term stored plant materials when compared to freshly-harvested ones. In an attempt to evaluate the effect of long-term storage on the safety of some commonly used medicinal plants, the Ames test which involved the use of three Salmonella typhimurium tester strains (TA 98, TA 100 and TA 1535) were conducted. Current findings indicate the absence of any mutagenic effects resulting from the storage of medicinal plant materials for as long as 16 years. Although freshly collected Acokanthera oppositifolia extract demonstrated a mutagenic effect against TA 1535 strain at the highest concentration tested, no such effect was observed in the stored material. Further studies involving metabolic activation systems and in vivo conditions may further elucidate the effect of long-term storage on the safety of medicinal plants...|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to assess botanical composition, DMY and chemical composition of Fogera upland natural pastureland under different application rates of N fertilizer and <b>harvesting</b> stages <b>of</b> natural pasture at smallholder farmers condition. The {{experiment was}} conducted using 3 x 4 factorial experiment arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications and the treatment consisted three stages <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> (60, 90 and 120 days) and four levels of N fertilizer application (0, 23, 46 and 69 kg N/ha) on the natural pasture land. The botanical composition of the natural pasture land that have been identified at the experimental site included thirteen grasses, seven annual legumes and seven other herbaceous species belonging to different families. The influence <b>of</b> stages <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> was significant (P< 0. 05) but application of N fertilizer was not significant on total DMY of the pasture. Natural pasture harvested at 120 -days <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> and at a fertilizer application of 69 kg/ha results the highest DMY (9. 97 t/ha) while the lowest level was (5. 38 t/ha) from unfertilized plots at 120 -days <b>of</b> <b>harvesting.</b> The effect <b>of</b> stage <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> and fertilizer level on DMY of legume components was highly significant (P< 0. 001) but for the grass components stage <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> had non- significant effect, where as fertilizer had a highly significant effect (P< 0. 001). The relative proportion of legumes in the pastureland reached highest at 90 -days <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> {{at all levels of}} fertilizer application. The proportion of legumes varied from the highest mean of 56. 18 % to the lowest of 37. 66 % at 90 and 120 -days <b>of</b> <b>harvesting,</b> respectively while that of grasses ranged from 58. 09 % to 40. 24 % at 120 and 90 -days <b>of</b> <b>harvesting,</b> respectively. The relative proportion of grasses increased with increasing levels of N fertilizer and stage <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> up to 120 -days. Significant effect <b>of</b> stage <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> (P< 0. 001) on CP, NDF, ADF, hemi-cellulose, cellulose, P and IVDMD were obtained at all levels of fertilizer application. At 60 -days <b>of</b> <b>harvesting,</b> highest values <b>of</b> 15. 53 %, 0. 41 % and 54. 86 % were obtained for CP, P and IVDMD, respectively. However, the lowest values 55. 63 %, 37. 32 %, 17. 55 % and 32. 02 % were obtained for NDF, ADF, hemi-cellulose and cellulose, respectively at the same stage <b>of</b> <b>harvesting.</b> The CP content was significantly (P< 0. 001) lower (6. 76 %) at 120 -days <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> compared with other stages <b>of</b> <b>harvesting.</b> At all levels of N- fertilizer, the mean CP content obtained were above the reported critical level for ruminant’s microorganism’s functioning (7 %). The IVDMD at 90 and 120 -day harvesting was 50. 09 % and 38. 76 %, respectively. The values at all harvesting stages were below the reported threshold value that ranged between 55 and 70 % for medium quality forages from natural pastures. The results obtained in the present study revealed that fertilizer application increased the yield of natural pasturelands by 36. 07 %. Fertilizer applications at the level of 46 kg/ha resulted in higher mean dry matter yield of 9. 58 t/ha and higher nutritional quality (11. 89 % CP, 1. 08 t/ha CPY, 49. 91 % IVDMD and 4. 65 t/ha IVDMDY) of the natural pasture.
