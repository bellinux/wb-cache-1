2500|$|Chisel plows are {{becoming}} more popular as a primary tillage tool in row crop farming areas. Basically the <b>chisel</b> <b>plow</b> is a very heavy duty field cultivator intended to operate at depths from 15cm [...] {{to as much as}} 46cm [...] However some models may run much deeper. Each of the individual ploughs, or shanks, are typically set from nine inches (229mm) to twelve inches (305mm) apart. Such a plough can encounter significant soil drag, consequently a tractor of sufficient power and good traction is required. When planning to plough with a chisel plough it is important to bear in mind that 10 to 20 horsepower (7.5 to 15kW) per shank will be required, depending on depth.|$|E

The four agronomic treatments studied were <b>chisel</b> <b>plowed</b> with conventional chemical inputs (CT), no-till with conventional chemical inputs (NT), <b>chisel</b> <b>plowed</b> with low chemical input and a winter leguminous cover crop (CTL), and organic-based <b>chisel</b> <b>plowed</b> with a winter leguminous cover crop (CTO).

Variability of yields in NT and CTO systems was better explained by precipitation in early spring and during pollination and grain fill than that in CT and CTL. No-till and CTL tended to produce higher maximal yields than CT at the summit/ steep-sloped areas (lower WI), while at intermediate and high WI levels the differences between them were inconsistent.

Continuous corn (Zea mays L.) and a corn‐soybean [Glycine max L. (Herr.) ] rotation were grown using moldboard <b>plowing,</b> <b>chisel</b> <b>plowing,</b> ridge‐tillage, or no‐tillage methods. Tillage and crop rotation effects on soil pH, Bray P 1, 1 M NH 4 OAc exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg, total C, and total N in the top 200 mm were evaluated. Profile NO 3 ‐N concentrations were also measured in spring and autumn of 1988. Crop yields and N use efficiencies were used to assess sustainability. Bray P 1 levels increased, but exchangeable K decreased for all cropping and tillage methods. Nutrient stratification was evident for no‐tillage and ridge‐tillage methods, while the moldboard plowing treatment had the most uniform soil test levels within the 200 mm management zone. <b>Chisel</b> <b>plowing</b> incorporated fertilizer to a depth of 100 mm. Soil pH was lower with continuous corn than with crop rotation because of greater and more frequent N applications. Profile NO 3 ‐N concentrations were significantly different for sampling depth and among tillage methods in spring 1988. In autumn the concentrations were significantly different for sampling depth and for a rotation by tillage interaction. Estimated N use efficiencies were 40 and 50 kg grain per kg N for continuous corn, and 48 and 69 kg grain per kg N for rotated corn in 1988 and 1989, respectively.

A three-phase field {{study was conducted}} to investigate the impact of two tillage systems (chisel vs. no-till) and different N application management systems on flow-weighted NO 3 -N concentrations and leaching losses to tile water. The study was conducted at Iowa State University 2 ̆ 7 s Northeastern Research Center, near Nashua, Iowa, from 1990 to 1992, 1993 to 1998, and 2001 to 2005. N application rates of 202 and 168 kg-N ha- 1 during the first and third phases and low N rates of 135 and 110 kg-N ha- 1 during the second phase were applied to continuous corn (CC) and rotated corn (CS), respectively, for both tillage systems. Rotated corn plots had significantly (p = 0. 05) higher corn grain yields and lower NO 3 -N leaching losses than CC plots for both tillage systems. On the average, higher flow-weighted NO 3 -N concentrations were observed during the first phase (20. 7 mg L- 1), followed by the third phase (18. 7 mg L- 1) and the second phase (10. 5 mg L- 1) due to higher N application rates. <b>Chisel</b> <b>plowing</b> increased corn grain yields and resulted in almost equivalent NO 3 -N leaching losses to tile water compared with the no-till system. Effects of a wet year after dry years and low plant N uptake in some years elevated NO 3 -N concentrations to as high as 32. 8 mg L- 1 in 1990, 12. 5 mg L- 1 in 1995, and 24. 5 mg L- 1 in 2004. Fall-applied manure and <b>chisel</b> <b>plowing</b> had significantly higher NO 3 -N concentrations of 27 mg L- 1 compared with 17. 7 mg L- 1 from no-till and spring-applied manure.

40|$|Introduction The dynamic {{response}} of soil on tillage tools, {{is an important}} factor in determining their performance. For a tractor with a certain size, a reduction in draft force, the working width and speed of tools can rise and result in increasing performance and reduce costs. Researches carried out in order to reduce the draft force led to design and build new tillage tools called Bent Leg and Parra plows. The dual bent blade sub-surface tillage tool was built and examined inspired by the shape of a bent leg. The researches indicated that the combination of a dual bent blade sub-surface tillage tool and <b>chisel</b> <b>plow</b> could be used in order to reduce draft force, loosen the seed bed by the <b>chisel</b> <b>plow</b> and wings, increase in soil disturbance area by the wings, and create a suitable space for root growth by <b>chisel</b> <b>plow.</b> Since the fuel consumption and traction power of tractor are the limiting factors for pulling tools in the soil. The rake angle of tillage tools is the penetration factor of the tools to the soil. It is necessary to determine the optimized rake and bend angles according to their effect on draft force and better penetration in soil. In this research, the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was utilized to determine the optimized points of wing geometry of winged <b>chisel</b> <b>plow</b> in order to minimize the draft and vertical forces of tillage tool. Materials and Methods Using the properties of dual bent blade subsurface tillage implement and <b>chisel</b> <b>plow,</b> the winged <b>chisel</b> <b>plow</b> was designed by Catia V 5 R 20 software and was built in the workshop of mechanics of biosystems engineering department at Shiraz University. The effect of three factors of working depth of wing (5, 10, and 15 cm), bend angle (10, 20, and 30 degree), and rake angle (7. 5, 15, and 22. 5 degree) were analyzed on draft and vertical forces of wined <b>chisel</b> <b>plow</b> in soil bin of Karaj Agricultural Engineering Research Institute. The length, width, and depth of the soil bin were 24 m, 1. 7 m, and 1 m, respectively. The most important issue was to study the main effects and interactions of factors. So, the Response Surface Methodology was selected. With the help of this statistical design, the numbers of experiments were reduced and all coefficients of quadratic regression and interaction factors were estimated. The experiments were conducted based on the central composite design considering three main surface including central and axial points for each factors.

A six–year (1993 – 1998) field study was conducted on subsurface–drained Clyde–Kenyon–Floyd soils to quantify the impact of two tillage systems (<b>chisel</b> <b>plow</b> vs. no tillage) and two N fertilizer management practices (preplant single application vs. late–spring soil test based application) on nitrate–nitrogen (NO 3 –N) leaching loss with subsurface drain discharge from corn (Zea mays L.) soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation plots. Preplant injected urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) fertilizer was applied at the rate of 110 kg ha– 1 to <b>chisel</b> <b>plow</b> and no–till corn plots, while the late–spring N application rate averaged 179 and 156 kg ha– 1 for the no–till and <b>chisel</b> <b>plow</b> corn plots, respectively. Data on subsurface drainage flow volume, NO 3 –N concentrations in subsurface drainage water, NO 3 –N loss with subsurface drainage flow, and crop yield were collected and analyzed using a randomized complete block design. Differences in subsurface drainage flow volume due to annual variations in rainfall significantly (P = 0. 05) affected the NO 3 –N loss with subsurface drainage flows. High correlation (R 2 = 0. 89) between annual subsurface drainage flow volume and the annual NO 3 –N leaching loss with subsurface drainage water was observed. The flow–weighted average annual NO 3 –N concentrations varied from a low of 6. 8 mg L– 1 in 1994 to a high of 13. 9 mg L– 1 in 1996. Results of this study indicated that NO 3 –N losses from the <b>chisel</b> <b>plow</b> plots were 16 % (16 vs. 19 kg–N ha– 1) lower in comparison with no–till plots, while corn grain yield was 11 % higher in the <b>chisel</b> <b>plow</b> plots (8. 3 vs. 7. 5 Mg ha– 1).

The main objective of this project was {{to determine the effects of}} crop rotation, weed control, tillage and nutrient source and their interactions on weed communities and weed emergence. The field experiment was conducted on a Sainte-Rosalie clay and a Duravin loam in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada, in 1996 and 1997.

The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with a 3 × 4 factorial. The effect of plowing depth {{on all of the}} parameters mentioned was highly significant. Implement draft and drawbar power requirement both increased with plowing depth, whereas a decreasing trend of specific draft with depth was observed. Soil moisture content had no significant effect on draft and specific draft of <b>chisel</b> <b>plow</b> in the range of moisture contents studied, though both parameters were minimized at 10 - 12 % m. c. At this moisture level, the drawbar power requirement showed a significant reduction comparing with the other two moisture levels.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} organic material turnover on soil structure and maize photosynthetic rate was researched in this paper. The {{results showed that}} comparing the control treatment, the soil bulk density of two treatments of shallow reversing and <b>chiseling</b> <b>plow</b> with straw returning and organic fertilizer were decreased by 0. 13 g·cm- 3 and 0. 09 g·cm- 3, respectively. The application of shallow reversing and <b>chiseling</b> <b>plow</b> with straw turnover,organic fertilizer, green organic fertilizer and bio-fertilizer could reduce soil hardness, change the soil three phase state, improve the soil physics structure. Organic fertilizer and green organic fertilizer and bio-fertilizer increased the maize photosynthetic rate at trumpet period by 2. 1 ~ 7. 6 μmol·m- 2 ·s- 1. The transpiration rate of straw turnover and bio-fertilizer treatments was decreased by 57 % and 56 % separately. Conductances of all treatments were {{lower than that of}} the control treatment at trumpet period. Meanwhile stomatal conductance was increased at filling stage which may lead to the decreasing CO 2 concentration with the reason that reducing of stomatal booster caused the lower CO 2 concentration. Returning of organic materials could reduce soil bulk density and com paction, make the soil three phase state having a reasonable range, improve crop photosynthetic rate, decrease the transpiration rate, especially the treatments of straw returning and organic fertilize. In short, protection tillage and organic materials returning to field play a positive role for improving soil fertility, soil physical characteristics, crop photosynthetic rate and crop yields...|$|R
40|$|Draft {{measurements}} {{were made for}} major primary tillage implements operating on sandy loam soil. Implements included three <b>chisel</b> <b>plows</b> of different shanks, an offset disk harrow, a moldboard plow and a disk plow. The effects of speed and depth upon the draft {{measurements were}} investigated. Soil classification, implement specifications and results of tillage experiments are reported. A general regression equation to predict draft of these implements was developed based on speed and depth. A significant increase in draft was observed for all the implements {{with an increase in}} depth. The values of specific draft of the six tillage implements tested were affected significantly by speed and depth also. The relationships between specific draft and speed are presented graphically...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} in 1994 to evaluate P and K fertilizer placement methods for {{corn and soybeans}} managed with no-till and chisel-plow tillage. The study consists of four trials: P for corn, P for soybeans, K for corn, and K for soybeans. Corn and soybeans are grown in a rotation by alternating crops each year between adjacent areas with Mahaska and Nira soils. Treatments are applied for both crops. Cornstalks of plots managed with chisel-plow tillage are <b>chisel</b> <b>plowed</b> {{in the fall and}} field cultivated in the spring, whereas soybean residues are field-cultivated in the spring. Crops are planted using 30 -inch row spacing, Yetter bubble-type coulter blades, Yetter 2976 series dry fertilizer coulters, and Martin residue managers...|$|R
