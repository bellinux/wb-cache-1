5|$|Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis, {{a primary}} infection, {{typically}} presents as {{swelling of the}} <b>conjunctiva</b> and eyelids (blepharoconjunctivitis), accompanied by small white itchy lesions {{on the surface of}} the cornea.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} {{may occur}} {{in association with}} several systemic disorders (see table). These ulcers are clinically and histopathologically identical to the lesions of aphthous stomatitis, but this type of oral ulceration is {{not considered to be}} true aphthous stomatitis by some sources. Some of these conditions may cause ulceration on other mucosal surfaces in addition to the mouth such as the <b>conjunctiva</b> or the genital mucous membranes. Resolution of the systemic condition often leads to decreased frequency and severity of the oral ulceration.|$|E
5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, <b>conjunctiva,</b> and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.|$|E
40|$|The <b>conjunctivas</b> of 273 {{inflamed}} {{eyes were}} cultured by both aerobic and anaerobic techniques. Isolations {{were obtained from}} 267 (97. 8 %) of the eyes. Aerobic organisms were isolated from 237 (86. 8 %) of the <b>conjunctivas.</b> Staphylococcus aureus from 63 (23. 1 %) of the diseased eyes was the aerobic pathogen most often isolated. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 172 (63. 0 %) of the <b>conjunctivas.</b> Propionibacterium acnes was isolated from 126 (46. 2 %) of the <b>conjunctivas,</b> and Peptostreptococcus species were isolated from 80 (29. 3 %) of the <b>conjunctivas.</b> Comparison with the bacteriology of 96 normal eyes showed that anaerobes play a much greater role as etiological agents of conjunctivitis than formerly believed. When anaerobic bacteria were isolated, they appeared on the average in 7 days, indicating {{that they may be}} missed by ordinary bacteriological culturing...|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasma <b>conjunctivae</b> is the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} infectious keratoconjunctivitis, a highly contagious ocular infection that affects {{both domestic and}} wild Caprinae species in the European Alps. In order to study the transmission and spread of M. <b>conjunctivae</b> across domestic and wild Caprinae populations, we developed a molecular method for subtyping and identifying strains of M. <b>conjunctivae.</b> This method is based on DNA sequence determination of a variable domain within the gene lppS, a gene that encodes an antigenic lipoprotein of M. <b>conjunctivae.</b> This domain of lppS shows variations among different strains but remains constant upon generations of individual strains on growth medium and thus allows identification of individual strains and estimation of their phylogenetic intercorrelations. The variable domain of lppS is amplified by PCR using primers that match conserved sequences of lppS flanking it. Sequence analysis of the amplified fragment enables fine subtyping of M. <b>conjunctivae</b> strains. The method is applicable both to isolated strains and to clinical samples directly without requiring the cultivation of the strain. Using this method, we show that M. <b>conjunctivae</b> was transmitted between domestic and wild animals that were grazing in proximate pastures. Certain animals also presented infections with two different strains simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasma <b>conjunctivae</b> is {{considered}} the major cause of infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC) in Alpine ibex (Capra i. ibex) and chamois (Rupicapra r. rupicapra). While {{it is known that}} domestic sheep can act as healthy carriers for M. <b>conjunctivae,</b> this question has not been addressed in wild ungulates so far. In this study, bacteriological investigations and field observations were performed to assess whether free-ranging Alpine ibex can be healthy carriers of M. <b>conjunctivae.</b> Among 136 ibex without clinical signs of IKC, M. <b>conjunctivae</b> was identified 26 times (19. 1 %) by TaqMan PCR. To assess the potential pathogenicity of M. <b>conjunctivae</b> strains isolated from asymptomatic eyes, strains from three healthy ibex and from 15 IKC-ibex and IKC-chamois were analysed genetically by DNA sequence analysis of the variable part of the lppS gene. No significant differences were observed between strains from asymptomatic and clinically affected animals, reflecting the assumption that healthy ibex may act as carriers for M. <b>conjunctivae</b> strains that may be pathogenic for other individuals. Our results further indicate that development of IKC is associated with M. <b>conjunctivae</b> load in the eyes. In addition, a questionnaire survey revealed that IKC is generally less common in ibex than chamois and that infection in wild ungulates is not necessarily linked to the presence of sheep. These data support the hypothesis that apparently healthy ibex may be important in the epizootiology of IKC and indicate that host predilection {{may play a role in}} IKC development...|$|R
25|$|Conjunctivitis is {{identified}} by irritation and redness of the <b>conjunctiva.</b> Except in obvious pyogenic or toxic/chemical conjunctivitis, a slit lamp (biomicroscope) {{is needed to}} have any confidence in the diagnosis. Examination of the tarsal <b>conjunctiva</b> is usually more diagnostic than the bulbar <b>conjunctiva.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ocular tumors* in {{dogs are}} found in the eyelid, <b>conjunctiva,</b> third eyelid, cornea, sclera, iris, ciliary body, retina, choroid, optic nerve, and orbit. The most common types are Meibomian gland adenoma (eyelid), {{papilloma}} (eyelid), melanoma (eyelid, <b>conjunctiva,</b> sclera, iris, ciliary body, choroid), squamous cell carcinoma (<b>conjunctiva),</b> adenoma (ciliary body), adenocarcinoma (ciliary body), lymphoma (retina, choroid, ciliary body), medulloepithelioma (retina, choroid), ganglioglioma (retina, choroid), osteosarcoma (orbit), mast cell tumor (orbit), and optic nerve sheath meningioma.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{conjunctivitis}} shows a fine, diffuse pinkness of the <b>conjunctiva,</b> {{which is}} easily mistaken for the ciliary infection of iris (iritis), {{but there are}} usually corroborative signs on microscopy, particularly numerous lymphoid follicles on the tarsal <b>conjunctiva,</b> and sometimes a punctate keratitis.|$|E
40|$|Infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC), {{caused by}} Mycoplasma <b>conjunctivae,</b> {{is a highly}} {{contagious}} ocular disease in Caprinae.

40|$|The {{induction}} of caprine keratoconjunctivitis by the subconjunctival inoculation of a cloned {{culture of}} Mycoplasma <b>conjunctivae</b> is described. The clinical {{course of the}} experimental disease {{was similar to that}} noted in naturally occurring outbreaks of "pink-eye" among goats, and biopsies of inflamed <b>conjunctivae</b> showed similar histological response. M. <b>conjunctivae</b> was consistently recovered from the inflamed conjunctival tissues of inoculated animals that developed ocular disease, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates and establishing this organism as an etiological agent of caprine keratoconjunctivitis. Immunological studies suggested that cellular immune mechanisms {{may play a role in}} protecting animals from disease produced by this mycoplasma...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{roles of}} {{domestic}} and wild host populations in infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC) epidemiology have been extensively discussed claiming a domestic reservoir for the more susceptible wild hosts, however, based on limited data. With the aim to better assess IKC epidemiology in complex host-pathogen alpine systems, the long-term infectious dynamics and molecular epidemiology of Mycoplasma <b>conjunctivae</b> was investigated in all host populations from six study areas in the Pyrenees {{and one in the}} Cantabrian Mountains (Northern Spain). Detection of M. <b>conjunctivae</b> was performed by qPCR on 3600 eye swabs collected during seven years from hunted wild ungulates and sympatric domestic sheep (n = 1800 animals), and cluster analyses of the strains were performed including previous reported local strains. Mycoplasma <b>conjunctivae</b> was consistently detected in three Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra p. pyrenaica) populations, as well as in sheep flocks (17. 0 % of sheep) and occasionally in mouflon (Ovis aries musimon) from the Pyrenees (22. 2 % in one year/area); statistically associated with ocular clinical signs only in chamois. Chamois populations showed different infection dynamics with low but steady prevalence (4. 9 %) and significant yearly fluctuations (0. 0 %- 40. 0 %). Persistence of specific M. <b>conjunctivae</b> strain clusters in wild host populations is demonstrated for six and nine years. Cross-species transmission between chamois and sheep and chamois and mouflon were also sporadically evidenced. Overall, independent M. <b>conjunctivae</b> sylvatic and domestic cycles occurred at the wildlife-livestock interface in the alpine ecosystems from the Pyrenees with sheep and chamois as the key host species for each cycle, and mouflon as a spill-over host. Host population characteristics and M. <b>conjunctivae</b> strains resulted in different epidemiological scenarios in chamois, ranging from the fading out of the mycoplasma to the epidemic and endemic long-term persistence. These findings highlight the capacity of M. <b>conjunctivae</b> to establish diverse interactions and persist in host populations, also with different transmission conditions...|$|R

40|$|A serine-rich {{membrane}} protein named LppS from Mycoplasma <b>conjunctivae,</b> the aetiological agent of infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC) {{of domestic and}} wild Caprinae, was characterized. Gene cloning and sequence analysis of the lppS gene revealed that it encoded a {{membrane protein}} precursor. The protein had a typical signal sequence and a signal peptidase II cleavage site followed by a cysteine residue representing a potential acylation site. The mature LppS protein had an apparent molecular mass of 150 kDa and {{was found in the}} detergent-associated fraction of Tween 20 extractedM. <b>conjunctivae</b> proteins. It possessed a serine-rich domain of 41 aa with 37 (90 ? 2 %) serine residues. Twenty-seven of these serine residues were contiguous. The protein adhered to lamb joint synovial cells. Using an in vitro adhesion model, Fab fragments from IgG directed against recombinant purified LppS were shown to specifically inhibit adhesion of M. <b>conjunctivae</b> to lamb cells. Thus, LppS is likely to be an adhesin ofM. <b>conjunctivae</b> that may {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of IKC...|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasma <b>conjunctivae,</b> the causative {{agent of}} {{infectious}} keratoconjunctivitis (IKC), was recently detected in asymptomatic Alpine ibex (Capra ibex ibex). This suggested that an external {{source of infection}} may not be required for an IKC outbreak in wildlife but might be initiated by healthy carriers, which contradicted previous serologic investigations in chamois. Our aims were to 1) assess the prevalence of M. <b>conjunctivae</b> among asymptomatic ibex and Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra) and its frequency in IKC-affected animals, 2) determine mycoplasma loads in different disease stages, and 3) characterize the M. <b>conjunctivae</b> strains involved. Eye swabs from 654 asymptomatic and 204 symptomatic animals were collected in diverse Swiss regions between 2008 and 2010, and tested by TaqMan real-time PCR. Data analysis was performed considering various patterns of IKC occurrence in the respective sampling regions. Strains from 24 animals were compared by cluster analysis. Prevalence of M. <b>conjunctivae</b> was 5. 6 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3. 7 - 8. 1 %) in asymptomatic ibex and 5. 8 % (CI: 3. 0 - 9. 9 %) in asymptomatic chamois, with significant differences between years and regions in both species. Detection frequency in symptomatic animals was significantly higher during IKC outbreaks than in nonepidemic situations (i. e., regular but low incidence or sporadic occurrence). Mycoplasma load was significantly lower in eyes from healthy carriers and animals with mild signs than from animals with moderate and severe signs. Although some strains were found in both asymptomatic and diseased animals of the same species, others apparently differed in their pathogenic potential depending on the infected species. Overall, we found a widespread occurrence of M. <b>conjunctivae</b> in wild Caprinae with and without IKC signs. Our results confirm {{the central role of}} M. <b>conjunctivae</b> in outbreaks but suggest that other infectious agents may be involved in IKC cases in nonepidemic situations. Additionally, presence and severity of signs are related to the quantity of M. <b>conjunctivae</b> in the eyes rather than to the strain. We propose that individual or environmental factors influence the clinical expression of the disease and that persistence of M. <b>conjunctivae</b> in populations of wild Caprinae cannot be excluded...|$|R

40|$|Background: Infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC) is a {{clinical}} condition affecting eyes {{of domestic and}} wild Caprinae worldwide, and Mycoplasma <b>conjunctivae</b> is considered the primary causative agent of IKC in sheep, goats and wild Caprinae. Domestic ruminants from high mountain habitats share grazing areas with wild mountain ungulates, such as chamois (Rupicapra spp.), Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) and European mouflon (Ovis aries musimon), and domestic sheep seem to act as M. <b>conjunctivae</b> reservoir. In this study, the presence of M. <b>conjunctivae</b> in domestic sheep and goats from the two main mountain ranges of Northern Spain, the Pyrenees and the Cantabrian Mountains, has been investigated. Results: Eye swabs were obtained from 439 domestic small ruminants selected from flocks that seasonally graze in alpine meadows during three consecutive years (2011 - 2012 - 2013). Seventy-nine out of the 378 domestic sheep (20. 9 %) tested positive to a M. <b>conjunctivae</b> specific real time-PCR (rt-PCR) {{in at least one}} eye, whereas all the 61 sampled domestic goats were negative. Statistically significant higher prevalence and higher proportion of infected flocks (P < 0. 001) was observed in the Pyrenees (25. 7 %; 12 flocks out of 13), where M. <b>conjunctivae</b> is widespread and probably endemic in domestic sheep, than in the Cantabrian Mountains (7. 8 %; one flock out of six).

During a period of 30 months, 196 patients with in life-threatening situations (of different, natural causes) were examined for petechial bleeding of <b>conjunctivae</b> and eyelids before, directly after and 122 (62 %) patients after 24 hours following CPR. In only 12 (6, 12 %) of 196 cases petechiae was registered. 8 (4 %) of them had petechiae before starting the CPR. In 3 of 4 cases the patients survived CPR and the finding of petechiae {{was a result of}} the intensive medical treatment in the hospital. In 0, 5 % of all cases petechial bleeding of <b>conjunctivae</b> and eyelids was found. This only case couldnt be explained by the documentary material of it.

25|$|Overexposure to {{ethyl acetate}} may cause {{irritation}} of the eyes, nose, and throat. Severe overexposure may cause weakness, drowsiness, and unconsciousness. Humans {{exposed to a}} concentration of 400ppm in 1.4mg/L ethyl acetate {{for a short time}} were affected by nose and throat irritation. Ethyl acetate is an irritant of the <b>conjunctiva</b> and mucous membrane of the respiratory tract. Animal experiments have shown that, at very high concentrations, the ester has central nervous system depressant and lethal effects; at concentrations of 20,000 to 43,000ppm (2.0–4.3%), there may be pulmonary edema with hemorrhages, symptoms of central nervous system depression, secondary anemia and liver damage. In humans, concentrations of 400ppm cause irritation of the nose and pharynx; cases have also been known of irritation of the <b>conjunctiva</b> with temporary opacity of the cornea. In rare cases exposure may cause sensitization of the mucous membrane and eruptions of the skin. The irritant effect of ethyl acetate is weaker than that of propyl acetate or butyl acetate.|$|E

LppT {{was shown to}} promote cell attachment to LSM 192 primary lamb joint synovial cells. Adhesion of M. <b>conjunctivae</b> to LSM 192 cells is inhibited by antibodies directed against LppT. The RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif of LppT {{was found to be}} a specific site for binding of M. <b>conjunctivae</b> to these eukaryotic host cells. Recombinant LppT fixed to polymethylmethacrylate slides binds LSM 192 cells, whereas LppT lacking the RGD site is deprived of binding capacity to LSM 192, and LppT containing RGE rather than RGD shows reduced binding. Synthetic nonapeptides derived from LppT containing RGD competitively inhibit binding of LSM 192 cells to LppT-coated slides, whereas nonapeptides containing RAD rather than RGD do not inhibit. RGD-containing, LppT-derived nonapeptides are able to directly inhibit binding of M. <b>conjunctivae</b> to LSM 192 cells by competitive inhibition, whereas the analogous nonapeptide containing RAD rather than RGD or the fibronectin-derived RGD hexapeptide has no inhibitory effect. These results reveal LppT as the first candidate of a RGD lectin in Mycoplasma species that is assumed to bind to beta integrins...|$|R
