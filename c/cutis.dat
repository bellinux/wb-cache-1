5|$|The pileipellis, the {{top layer}} of hyphae in the cap, is a <b>cutis.</b> The <b>cutis</b> is made up of {{cylindrical}} hyphae between 2 and 5µm thick. The inamyloid and thin-walled hyphae are covered in brown granules. The flesh in the cap is made up of cylindrical hyphae from 4 to 7µm wide with thin cell walls. They are all generative hyphae, and run parallel to one another. They can be either inamyloid or only weakly dextrinoid. The flesh in the gills is basically the same as the flesh in the cap, but for {{the fact that it is}} completely inamyloid. The hyphae of the stipitipellis, the uppermost layer in the stem, also form a <b>cutis.</b> The cylindrical hyphae making up the <b>cutis</b> run parallel to one another, and measure from 2.5 to 4.5µm in width, with walls up to 1µm thick. They are encrusted with a brown pigment, and are dextrinoid. The flesh of the stem is made up of generative hyphae running lengthways (that is, up and down the stem). The cells are 5 to 8µm wide, and are smooth and colourless; the cell walls up to 1µm thick. They are dextrinoid. All M.funalis hyphae lack clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|Enlargement of the spleen {{may occur}} in AML, {{but it is}} {{typically}} mild and asymptomatic. Lymph node swelling is rare in AML, in contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The skin is involved about 10% {{of the time in}} the form of leukemia <b>cutis.</b> Rarely, Sweet's syndrome, a paraneoplastic inflammation of the skin, can occur with AML.|$|E
5|$|Spores of R.brevipes are egg-shaped to {{more or less}} spherical, {{and measure}} 7.5–10 by 6.5–8.5µm; they have a {{partially}} reticulate (network-like) surface dotted with warts measuring up to 1µm high. The cap cuticle is arranged {{in the form of}} a <b>cutis</b> (characterized by hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface) comprising interwoven hyphae with rounded tips. There are no cystidia on the cap (pileocystidia).|$|E
5|$|The flesh in {{the gills}} is {{composed}} of cylindrical hyphae measuring between 4 and 8μm thick that run parallel to one another. The hyphae typically have fairly thin, smooth walls, but {{they can have a}} small amount of brown pigment, which stains orange-brown in potassium hydroxide. The pileipellis, the uppermost layer of hyphae in the cap, forms a <b>cutis</b> made up of cylindrical, slightly thicker-walled hyphae of between 5 and 10μm wide. They can be interwoven or primarily extending from the margin to the centre. The pigmentation is yellowish-brown and stains reddish-brown in potassium hydroxide. The hyphae below the pileipellis run parallel to one another and measure between 4 and 8μm in width. Their yellowish-brown pigment stains orange-brown in potassium hydroxide. The stipitipellis, the uppermost layer of hyphae on the stem, also forms a <b>cutis.</b> The cylindrical hyphae run parallel to one another and have thick cell walls. They have a dark red-brown pigment, which stains darker still in potassium hydroxide. Clamp connections are present.|$|E
5|$|The {{yellowish}} hyphae {{are between}} 15 and 13.5μm wide with {{a wall of}} variable thickness. There are clamp connections at the septa (the walls dividing individual hypha cells). The flesh in the cap is radial, and {{is made up of}} yellowish hyphae of between 2.4 and 20μm wide. The pileipellis, the outermost layer of hyphae, forms a <b>cutis,</b> and on older specimens (and on the small scales) forms a trichoderm.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushrooms}} {{produce a}} white spore print, and the spores are broadly elliptical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), inamyloid, measuring 6–7.5 by 4–5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, without clamps, and measure 17–32 by 6.0–7.5μm. The hymenium lacks cystidia. The {{arrangement of the}} hyphae in the cap cuticle ranges from a <b>cutis</b> (with hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface) to a trichoderm (hyphae perpendicular to the cap surface); these hyphae are roughly cylindrical, and measure 3.5–8.0μm wide, with roughly cylindrical to club-shaped ends that are 6.0–11.0μm wide. There are no clamp connections in the hyphae of T.vaccinum.|$|E
5|$|The basidiospores are 10.5–13.5 by 6.5–8µm with an {{ellipsoid}} shape. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 35–55 by 10–15µm, and four-spored. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) are 70–110 by 25–45µm, fusiform (spindle-shaped), utriform (shaped like a leather bottle) or lageniform (flask shaped); some have an apical excrescence (outgrowth). Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are 60–75 by 15–27µm, commonly fusiform or utriform; they cover completely the gill edge. The cap cuticle is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae {{embedded in a}} gelatinous matrix). The stipitipellis is a <b>cutis</b> (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia (cystidia on the stipe surface) are sometimes present, and they are 100–360 by 10–20µm and mostly cylindrical.|$|E
5|$|The basidiospores are {{ellipsoid}} {{and measure}} 12–16 by 8–9.5µm. Basidia are 20–35 by 7–15µm and usually four-spored, but sometimes two-spored basidia can occur. Pleurocystidia are 60–90 by 20–50µm with variable morphology: club-shaped, fusiform, ovoid, and sometimes {{with a small}} apical papilla. Cheilocystidia are 55–100 by 15–40µm with similar morphology to the pleurocystidia; they completely cover the gill edge. The cap cuticle (pileipellis) is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae wide embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Stipitipellis is a <b>cutis</b> (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia are sometimes present, measuring 70–180 by 10–25µm; they are mostly cylindrical. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is white, and the oval to oblong spores are 7.5–9.5μm long by 5.0–7.0μm wide. Spores are smooth, hyaline (translucent), nonamyloid, {{and have a}} {{prominent}} hilum. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to club shaped, four spored, and measure 39–50 by 8.0–9.6μm. The cystidia present on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are thin walled, hyaline, have a short stalk and a spherical apical portion, and measure 29–41 by 12–21μm; cystidia are absent from the gill face. The cap cuticle ranges in cellular form from a <b>cutis</b> (in which the hyphae are bent over, running parallel to the cap surface) to a trichoderm (with hyphae emerging roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface); the hyphae comprising the cuticle are cylindrical, and measure 2.0–9.0μm wide with a club-shaped tip up to 11μm wide.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, the spore {{color is}} white. The spores are smooth, {{ellipsoidal}} to tear-shaped, hyaline (translucent), not amyloid, and measure 3.9–5.2 by 2.6–3.3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells in the}} hymenium) are four-spored and hyaline, with dimensions of 16–20 by 4–5μm. They have clamps at their bases. There are no cystidia on either the edges (cheilocystidia) or faces (pleurocystidia) of the gills. The arrangement of the hyphae in the hymenophoral tissue varies from regular to interwoven. The cap cuticle is a <b>cutis</b> (a type of tissue where the hyphae are arranged more or less parallel to the surface), formed by hyphae with septa, roughly 4–9μm in diameter. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae. The sclerotium is made of hyphae that have yellow pigment in their walls that appear in cross-section to be pseudoparenchymatous (compactly interwoven short-celled hyphae that resemble parenchyma of higher plants), and measure 5–10μm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is pink, and the spores measure 10–13 by 6–9μm. They are heterodiametric (with {{different}} diameters in different directions), possessing between 6 and 8 pronounced angles. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, lack clamps, and measure 33–40 by 9–14μm. Located on the gill edge, the thin-walled, inconspicuous cheilocystidia measure 20–30 by 5–9μm and have shapes ranging from irregular cylinders to narrow clubs to flasks. The cap cuticle is arranged {{in the form}} of a <b>cutis</b> (with bent-over hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface) to a trichoderm (where the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, perpendicular to the cap surface), comprising cylindrical to inflated hyphae that are up to 20μm wide. The cap tissue is made of narrow cylindrical hyphae that are 4.5–9μm in diameter. They contain granules that have a purple-brown pigment. The stipe cuticle is made of loosely arranged, cylindrical hyphae measuring 2–7μm. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{ellipsoid}} {{and measure}} 11–16 by 8–11µm. Basidia are 20–40 by 8–16µm; {{they are usually}} four-spored but sometimes two-spored, and, more rarely, one-spored forms can occur. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent in most collections; if present they are scarce and similar to the cheilocystidia. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) measure 30–70 by 10–35µm, and are club-, spindle-, or flask-shaped, and usually each one has an apical outgrowth up to 40µm long. The cheilocystidia completely cover the gill edge. In the form acystidiatus (N.C.Pathak) Vizzini & Contu, both pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia are completely absent. The cap cuticle (pileipellis) is an ixocutis (parallel hyphae embedded in a gelatinous matrix). The stipe cuticle (stipitipellis) is a <b>cutis</b> (parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix). Caulocystidia (cystidia on the cap) are sometimes present; they measure 65–140 by 10–25µm, and are mostly cylindrical.|$|E
25|$|Megalencephaly-capillary (MCAP) {{is one of}} the {{two major}} syndromes of megalencephaly. Typically, MCAP and MPPH can be {{distinguished}} by somatic features. MCAP includes many characteristics that are observed at birth including: cutaneous vascular malformations, especially capillary malformations of the face and <b>cutis</b> marmorata, polydactyly, connective tissue dysplasia, and focal or segmental body overgrowth. Furthermore, MCAP can occasionally be linked with asymmetric brain overgrowth (hemimegalencephaly) as well as segmental overgrowth of the body (hemihypertrophy).|$|E
25|$|The {{subcutaneous}} tissue (also hypodermis and subcutis) {{is not part}} of the skin, and lies below the dermis of the <b>cutis.</b> Its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying bone and muscle as well as supplying it with blood vessels and nerves. It consists of loose connective tissue, adipose tissue and elastin. The main cell types are fibroblasts, macrophages and adipocytes ({{subcutaneous tissue}} contains 50% of body fat). Fat serves as padding and insulation for the body.|$|E

500|$|The {{fruit body}} of Agaricus deserticola can {{grow up to}} [...] in height. Fresh {{specimens}} are usually white, but will age to a pale tan; dried fruit bodies are light gray or tan mixed with some yellow. The cap is [...] in diameter, initially conic, later becoming convex to broadly convex as it matures. The cap is composed of three distinct tissue layers: an outer volval layer, a middle cuticular layer (<b>cutis),</b> and an inner (tramal) layer which supports the gleba. The surface of the cap is white with yellow-brown to brown-tipped raised small scales; these scales result from {{the breakup of the}} volva and the <b>cutis.</b>|$|E
500|$|Acne usually {{improves}} {{around the}} age of 20, but may persist into adulthood. Permanent physical scarring may occur. There is good {{evidence to support the}} idea that acne and associated scarring negatively impact a person's psychological state, worsen mood, lower self-esteem, and are associated with a higher risk of anxiety disorders, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Another psychological complication of acne vulgaris is acne excoriée, which occurs when a person persistently picks and scratches pimples, irrespective of the severity of their acne. This can lead to significant scarring, changes in the affected person's skin pigmentation, and a cyclic worsening of the affected person's anxiety about their appearance. [...] Rare complications from acne or its treatment include the formation of pyogenic granulomas, osteoma <b>cutis,</b> and solid facial edema. [...] Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to reduce the chances of these poor outcomes.|$|E
500|$|The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) have {{dimensions}} of 18–26 by 6–9μm, and a shape ranging from ventricose-rostrate (broad {{in the middle}} and tapering to a beaklike neck) to mucronate (ending abruptly in a short sharp point). They are hyaline (translucent), thin-walled, and clamped, with necks that are 3–5μm long. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are similar in shape to cheilocystidia, but narrower (4–8μm wide), and usually have a shorter neck measuring 2.5–4μm. [...] The cap cuticle is a <b>cutis</b> (characterised by hyphae that run parallel to the cap surface) of long-celled, 2–3μm diameter, gelatinised hyphae. The hypodermium (the tissue layer under the cap cuticle) is filamentous, comprising 4–6μm diameter cells with pale brown walls. Clamps are common. The subhymenium (the tissue layer under the hymenium) is poorly developed, containing 2–4μm diameter cells with pale brown walls. The tissue comprising the hymenophore is made of short cylindric, 3–6μm diameter hyaline cells.|$|E
500|$|Boletopsis nothofagi has a monomitic hyphal structure, whereby all hyphae are {{generative}} hyphae, {{which serve}} {{the growth of}} the fungus. The cap, when viewed under a microscope, is clearly differentiated and consists of a <b>cutis,</b> a layer of oriented hyphae lying radially. They are up to 2µm thick, pigmented brown and covered with small, irregularly shaped granules. They become green when stained with potassium hydroxide (KOH), a diagnostic characteristic of the genus. The subcutis consists of swollen hyphae up to 6µm thick. These are thin-walled, filled with oil droplets and have clamp connections in the septa. The hymenial layer has porous cystidium structures measuring 4 by 80µm. The basidia of [...] B.nothofagi are pleurobasidia arising {{on the sides of the}} hyphae. They are cylindrical to club shaped, 5–10 by 20–30µm in size, and clamped at the base. The basidia always have four sterigmata, on which light brown, thin spores are situated. The spores are uneven, with flattened ends and elongated in shape. On average, they measure 5.3 by 4.1µm.|$|E
2500|$|This {{functional}} component {{consists of the}} only of the structural features of the feather tracts, namely the <b>cutis,</b> and connective tissue layer fascia superficialis. This {{functional component}} was named [...] "hydraulic skeletal" [...] {{due to the fact}} that the fat bodies embedded within <b>cutis</b> and fascia act similar to the hydrostatic bodies within a hydrostatic skeleton. However the functional role of the fat bodies within the hydraulic skeleto-muscular apparatus of the feathers is to counteract forces generated by the erector and depressor muscle of the feathers tracts. rather than to facilitate movement within of a body.|$|E
2500|$|Urbach–Wiethe disease (also {{known as}} lipoid proteinosis and hyalinosis <b>cutis</b> et mucosae) {{is a rare}} {{recessive}} genetic disorder, with approximately 400 reported cases since its discovery. [...] It was first officially reported in 1929 by Erich Urbach and Camillo Wiethe, although cases may be recognized dating back as early as 1908.|$|E
2500|$|In 1908, {{what appears}} to be the first case of Urbach–Wiethe disease was {{reported}} by Friedrich Siebenmann, a professor of otolaryngology in Basel, Switzerland. [...] In 1925, Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss dermatologist, reported on three similar patients. An official report of Urbach–Wiethe disease was first described in 1929 by a Viennese dermatologist and otorhinolaryngologist, Urbach and Wiethe. Its original name of 'lipoidosis <b>cutis</b> et mucosae' was changed to 'lipoid proteinosis <b>cutis</b> et mucosae' due to Urbach's belief that the condition was due to abnormal lipid and protein deposits within the tissues. Some have debated as to whether or not the disease is actually a form of mucopolysaccharidosis, amyloidosis, or even porphyria. [...] The discovery of the Urbach–Wiethe disease causing mutation to the ECM1 gene has now provided a definitive way to differentiate Urbach–Wiethe disease from these other conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Cellulite (also {{known as}} adiposis edematosa, dermopanniculosis deformans, status protrusus <b>cutis,</b> gynoid lipodystrophy, and orange peel syndrome) is the {{herniation}} of subcutaneous fat within {{fibrous connective tissue}} that manifests topographically as skin dimpling and nodularity, often on the pelvic region (specifically the buttocks), lower limbs, and abdomen. Cellulite occurs in most postpubescent females. A review gives a prevalence of 85 to 98% of women, indicating that it is physiologic rather than pathologic. [...] It can result from a complex combination of factors ranging from hormones to heredity.|$|E
