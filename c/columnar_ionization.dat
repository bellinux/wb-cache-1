5000|$|Jaffe is {{best known}} for his classic paper [...] "Zur Theorie der Ionisation in Kolonnen" [...] (Theory of <b>columnar</b> <b>ionization),</b> which was {{published}} in 1913. In it he proposes a model for charge recombination and charge collection efficiency for a [...] "column" [...] of charge generated by ionizing radiation.|$|E

The Jaffé theory of <b>columnar</b> <b>ionization</b> does not explain the observed variation of ion current when it is applied {{over a wide range}} of collecting fields to data free from volume recombination...|$|E
