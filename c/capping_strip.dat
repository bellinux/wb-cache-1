50|$|Cap guns {{get their}} {{name from the}} small discs of {{shock-sensitive}} explosive compounds (roughly 1.4 to 1.6 mm in diameter) that provide the noise and smoke, effectively {{the same as the}} Maynard tape primer and percussion caps used in real firearms of the mid to late 1800s but usually smaller and made from cheap plastic or paper. Some are arranged in plastic rings of eight or twelve. There are also single caps, roll caps (of 50 to 500), disk <b>caps,</b> and <b>cap</b> <b>strips</b> all of which are actually extremely small versions of percussion fireworks. Armstrong's mixture is often used today as the explosive, but previously the tiny powder charge was a simple mixture of potassium perchlorate, sulfur, and antimony sulfide sandwiched between two paper layers which hold in the gases long enough to give a sound report when the cap is struck.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to obtain information for use in the design of truss and plywood forms, particularly with reference to wing ribs. Tests were made on many designs of wing ribs, comparing different types in various sizes. Many tests were also made on parallel-chord specimens of truss and plywood forms in place of the actual ribs and on parts of wing ribs, such as truss diagonals and sections of <b>cap</b> <b>strips.</b> It was found that for ribs of any size or proportions, when they were designed to obtain a well-balanced construction and were carefully manufactured, distinct types are of various efficiencies; the efficiency is based on the strength per unit of weight. In all types of ribs the heavier are the stronger per unit of weight. Reductions in the weight of wing ribs are accompanied even in efficient designs by a much greater proportional reduction in strength...|$|R

5000|$|... ==History== A cap gun is a toy {{gun that}} creates a loud sound {{simulating}} a gunshot and {{a puff of smoke}} when the percussion cap is exploded. Cap guns were originally made of cast iron, but after World War II were made of zinc alloy, and most newer models are made of plastic. The [...] "Golden Age" [...] of cap guns was roughly a 20-year period following World War II when television became popular and such companies as Nichols, Hubley, Kenton, Kilgore, Wyandotte, Classy, Mattel, Actoy, Esquire, George Schmidt, and Stevens made millions of cap guns in various versions. While many had their names patterned after a hero or heroine, many cap guns also were named with western-sounding names, like: [...] "Stallion 45", [...] "Pony", [...] "Mustang", [...] "Pioneer", [...] "Cowboy", [...] "Texan", [...] "Colt 45", [...] "Rodeo", and such.Ring cap guns are usually modelled after revolver pistols, with the cap ring placed in the cylinder section of the toy gun. Like its real-world counterpart, when the trigger is pulled, the cylinder rotates a new cap into place, the hammer is drawn back, and then released; the shock causes the cap to explode harmlessly, producing the noise and smoke.Strip or paper cap guns use the aforementioned <b>cap</b> <b>strip</b> in lieu of the cap ring. As in the ring style of gun, each pull of the trigger advances the <b>cap</b> <b>strip</b> forward, pulls back the hammer {{to the point where it}} releases, striking the cap.Potato or spud guns occasionally use a cap to provide a burst of gas to fire the projectile, a small cutting of potato. One design employs a small reusable metal [...] "cartridge" [...] which has a recess for a cap at one end and a small drilling through to the other end, which holds the potato. Due to the low energy contained in a paper cap and the poor seal around the cartridge, these spud guns usually have very modest range, barely enough to eject the potato cutting.Mattel introduced a modified type of roll cap that used sprocket feed instead of simple friction feed.Today, cap guns and other toy guns in the United States must be manufactured with a bright orange, red, or yellow tip placed over the [...] "muzzle" [...] of the cap gun, or with the entire gun made in these or other bright colors. Laws requiring these markings were made because of incidents where civilians - usually children or teenagers - were killed by police officers when the officers thought they saw real guns. While these incidents were rare, lawmakers decided that toy guns must be marked so they cannot be mistaken for real guns.2 It is also possible to commit acts of robbery with a replica gun, since no shots need to be fired from a gun that looks real.There are many collectors throughout the world who collect all types of cap guns, even though restrictive laws in some areas may make it difficult. Whereas the toy guns brought small prices originally, they now command significant prices for many models, with some of the most famous sets of holsters, guns and original boxes selling for high prices at auctions and toy gun shows. Some collectors will collect all types of cap guns, but many collectors specialize in either guns named after a famous western hero or a particular company's set, like the Nichols Industries or Hubley cap guns.Caps have occasionally been used in toys other than cap guns where an explosive effect is desired. One example would be the [...] "Thunder Punch" [...] version of the He-Man action figure from the original 1980s Masters of the Universe toy line. Ring caps were placed in a [...] "backpack" [...] integrated into the figure, which contained the striking mechanism for the caps (as well as tiny vents to allow smoke from a triggered cap to escape). This mechanism was triggered by drawing the figure's spring-loaded right arm back and releasing it to swing forward; the explosion of the cap was intended to simulate a thunderous noise caused by the superhuman power of the character's punch. Another example is a relatively new type of Airsoft, called Hybrid Guns. Hybrid guns use small round BBs in the tip of a casing, usually designed to mimic that of its respective magazine. The caps are placed behind the casing. In electric models, the caps are burst, and the pressure is used to propel the BB forward in a manner similar to real firearms. The leftover energy is then sometimes put to use simulating recoil and a blowback system that ejects the casings Another use is in so-called [...] "cap bombs"; devices roughly in the shape of an aerial bomb that contain a firing mechanism in the nose capable of holding a single cap, either plastic or paper (cut from a strip), though types are not interchangeable due to the mutually exclusive design. With the newer designs they have both the paper cap or plastic cap. When dropped they hit a hard surface and explode.|$|R

Because of the greater area covered by the scaler compared to a knife, the scaling process is quicker to carry out. The configuration of the caps can be varied in order to adapt the scaler to different types of fish. The scaler has other useful applications such as removing small feathers from poultry. However, a scaler used on poultry should not then be used on fish as this could cause cross-contamination by bacteria such as Salmonella.

50|$|The {{following}} {{description is}} from USGS Bulletin 798 by C. R. Longwell in 1928:In all the large intermontane valleys {{adjacent to the}} Muddy Mountains and neighboring ranges there are thick clays or silts and associated deposits that have been relatively little disturbed by crustal deformation. As a rule they form belts from {{a fraction of a}} mile to several miles wide on each side of present stream valleys, above which the clay outcrops rise to a maximum height of approximately 600 feet. Adjacent to the high lands they feather out, lapping up on the older rocks. Between the Muddy and Virgin Mountains the area occupied by the clays is from 9 to 12 miles wide. South of St. Thomas this large area is divided into two nearly equal belts by Virgin River, and to the north the clays are cut by the converging Muddy and Virgin Valleys, each of which leaves a comparatively narrow strip of the deposits bordering the mountains. Between the streams the clays occupy a large triangular area extending more than 15 miles to the Mormon Mountains. In California Wash, the clay exposures extend a maximum of more than 10 miles to the ranges on the west, and they form wide belts bordering Meadow Valley Wash and the upper part of Muddy Creek. They have invaded St. Thomas Gap in places, and in the broad Grand Wash Valley they are exposed wherever the surface waste has been sufficiently dissected. In a word, the intermontane areas occupied by clays are nearly equal to the areas of the mountain ranges. However, these broad belts do not show continuous clay outcrops, for the clays are largely covered by a veneer of varying thickness formed from more recent waste that was used in building aggradation levels at several altitudes. The clays are conspicuous beneath the waste in the sides of the large valleys and small washes and in extensive badland tracts where the later <b>capping</b> has been <b>stripped</b> away.Owing to many interbedded layers of sandstone more or less firmly cemented, the clays tend to stand in steep fronts along wash courses. The edges of the sandy layers are visible in all sections, standing out as narrow shelves or forming a horizontal banding almost concealed by clay carried from above and plastered on the slope by infrequent rains. In detail the carved surfaces have an intricate but typical pattern, many times repeated. Steep slopes are dissected into long parallel spurs, and these subdivide repeatedly into steep spurs of many orders, all with rounded upper surfaces and separated by V-shaped trenches. From a distance the spurs resemble irregular columns. In places they are interrupted by persistent shelves formed on sandstone layers of unusual resistance, below which the typical patterns reappear.|$|R
