40|$|Nonoverlapping <b>closed</b> <b>loops</b> {{of around}} 25 - 35 amino acids formed via nonlocal {{interactions}} at the loop ends {{have been proposed}} as an important unit of protein structure. This hypothesis is significant as such short loops can fold quickly and so would not be bound by the Leventhal paradox, giving insight into the possible nature of the funnel in protein folding. Previously, these <b>closed</b> <b>loops</b> have been identified either by sequence analysis (conservation and autocorrelation) or studies of the geometry of individual proteins. Given the potential significance of the <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> hypothesis, we have explored a new strategy for determining <b>closed</b> <b>loops</b> from the insertions identified by the structural alignment of proteins sharing the same overall fold. We determined {{the locations of the}} <b>closed</b> <b>loops</b> in 37 pairs of proteins and obtained excellent agreement with previously published <b>closed</b> <b>loops.</b> The r elevance of NMR structures to <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> determination is briefly discussed. For cytochrome c, cytochrome b 562 and triosephophate isomerase, independent folding units have been determined on the basis of hydrogen exchange experiments and misincorporation proton-alkyl exchange experiments. The correspondence between these experimentally derived foldons and the theoretically derived <b>closed</b> <b>loops</b> indicates that the <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> hypothesis may provide a useful framework for analyzing such experimental data. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

50|$|MARS is an extracorporeal {{hemodialysis}} system {{composed of}} three different circuits: blood, albumin and low-flux dialysis. The blood circuit uses a double lumen catheter and a conventional hemodialysis device to pump the patient’s blood into the MARS FLUX, a biocompatible polysulfone high-flux dialyser. With a membrane surface area of 2.1 m2, 100 nm of thickness and a cut-off of 50 KDa, the MARSFLUX is essential to retaining the albumin in the dialysate. Blood is dialysed against a human serum albumin (HSA) dialysate solution that allows blood detoxification of both water-soluble and protein-bound toxins, {{by means of the}} presence of albumin in the dialysate (albumin dialysis). The albumin dialysate is then regenerated in a <b>close</b> <b>loop</b> in the MARS circuit by passing through the fibres of the low-flux diaFLUX filter, to clear water-soluble toxins and provide electrolyte/acid-base balance, by a standard dialysis fluid. Next, the albumin dialysate passes through two different adsorption columns; protein-bound substances are removed by the diaMARS AC250, containing activated charcoal and anionic substances are removed by the diaMARS IE250, filled with cholestyramine, an anion-exchange resin. The albumin solution is then ready to initiate another detoxifying cycle of the patient's blood that can be sustained until both adsorption columns are saturated, eliminating the need to continuously infuse albumin into the system during treatment (Fig. 1).|$|E
