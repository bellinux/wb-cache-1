5000|$|Papilio rutulus, {{the western}} tiger swallowtail, is a <b>common</b> <b>swallowtail</b> {{butterfly}} of western North America, frequently seen in urban parks and gardens, {{as well as}} in rural woodlands and riparian areas. It {{is a member of the}} Papilio genus, of which Papilio appalachiensis and Papilio xuthus are also members. It is a large, brightly colored and active butterfly, rarely seen at rest; its wingspan is 7 to 10 cm, and its wings are yellow with black stripes, and it has blue and orange spots near its tail. It has the [...] "tails" [...] on the hindwings that are often found in swallowtails.|$|E
50|$|Papilio zelicaon, the anise swallowtail, is a <b>common</b> <b>swallowtail</b> {{butterfly}} {{of western}} North America. Both {{the upper and}} lower sides of its wings are black, but the upper wing has a broad yellow stripe across it, which gives the butterfly an overall yellow appearance. There are striking blue spots on the rear edge of the rear wing, and the characteristic tails of the swallowtails. Its wingspan is 52-80 mm. Its body is somewhat shorter than the rather similar western tiger swallowtail, with which its range overlaps; it also lacks the black stripes, converging toward the tail, of the latter. There is a somewhat darker subspecies, P. z. nitra, which is rare throughout the range, though somewhat more often found at lower elevations.|$|E

5000|$|Papilio eurymedon, {{the pale}} {{swallowtail}} or pallid swallowtail, {{is a relatively}} <b>common</b> <b>swallowtail</b> butterfly found {{throughout much of the}} western North America. It is found on the Pacific coast from northern Baja California to southernmost British Columbia and inland to New Mexico and the Black Hills of South Dakota. It is present from the coast to western Montana and Wyoming to northern New Mexico. It is absent from most of Nevada and western Utah. It prefers open woodlands and forest clearings, especially near permanent bodies of water such as ponds, but also urban parks and is occasionally seen in suburban areas. Though not as common as the western tiger swallowtail, the pale swallowtail can be seen in large numbers at puddling parties where up to a dozen or more males may be gathered. There they join other species to sip water from damp soil to obtain nutrients for mating. Their appearance is quite {{similar to that of the}} western tiger swallowtail except they are a white-cream color or very pale yellow. Some pale swallowtails also have differing amounts of red-orange patches on the wings just above the tail. Tiger stripes and borders are thicker than those of western tiger swallowtails. The wingspan is typically 3.5 to 4.5 in.|$|E
50|$|Papilio cyproeofila, the <b>common</b> white-banded <b>{{swallowtail}},</b> is {{a species}} of swallowtail butterfly from the genus Papilio that is found in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo and Nigeria.|$|R

50|$|In Kashmir, the <b>common</b> yellow <b>swallowtail,</b> as Papilio machaon {{is called}} there, inhabits alpine meadows in the Himalayas {{occurring}} from 2000 ft in Kashmir valley to 16000 ft in the Garhwal Himalayas. In India, in Himachal Pradesh, {{it is found}} over 4000 ft only and in Sikkim over 8000 ft only.|$|R
50|$|Note that ashitaba {{closely resembles}} Angelica japonica, {{but can be}} {{distinguished}} by its blooming period, which lasts from May to October whereas A. japonica's blooming period lasts only between May and July. Another indicator is the characteristic color of its sap. The larvae of the <b>Common</b> Yellow <b>Swallowtail</b> are known to feed frequently on the plant.|$|R
50|$|Papilio machaon, the Old World swallowtail, is a {{butterfly}} {{of the family}} Papilionidae. The butterfly {{is also known as}} the <b>common</b> yellow <b>swallowtail</b> or simply the <b>swallowtail</b> (a <b>common</b> name applied to all members of the family, but this species is the 'original', first to go by the name). It is the type species of the genus Papilio.|$|R
50|$|Papilio troilus, the spicebush {{swallowtail}} or green-clouded butterfly, is a <b>common</b> black <b>swallowtail</b> butterfly {{found in}} North America. It has two subspecies, Papilio troilus troilus and Papilio troilus ilioneus, the latter found {{mainly in the}} Florida peninsula. The spicebush swallowtail derives its name from its most common host plant, the spicebush, members of the genus Lindera.|$|R
2500|$|The forked {{appearance}} of the swallowtails' hindwings, which can be seen when the butterfly is resting with its wings spread, {{gave rise to the}} <b>common</b> name <b>swallowtail.</b> As for its formal name, Linnaeus chose Papilio for the type genus, as papilio is Latin for [...] "butterfly". For the specific epithets of the genus, Linnaeus applied the names of Greek heroes to the swallowtails. The type species: Papilio machaon honored Machaon, one of the sons of Asclepius, mentioned in the Iliad.|$|R
25|$|Papilio demoleus is a <b>common</b> and {{widespread}} <b>swallowtail</b> butterfly. The butterfly {{is also known}} as the common lime butterfly, lemon butterfly, lime swallowtail, small citrus butterfly, chequered swallowtail, dingy swallowtail and citrus <b>swallowtail.</b> These <b>common</b> names refer to their host plants, which are usually citrus species such as the cultivated lime. Unlike most swallowtail butterflies, it does not have a prominent tail. The butterfly is a pest and invasive species from Asia and Australia which has spread to the Caribbean and Central America.|$|R
50|$|The {{density of}} wild {{animals in the}} valley is not high, but all the animals found are rare or endangered. A total 13 species of mammals are {{recorded}} for the park by CP Kala and its vicinity although only he sighted 9 species directly: {{northern plains grey langur}} Semnopithecus entellus, flying squirrel Petaurista petaurista, Himalayan black bear Ursus thibetanus (VU), red fox Vulpes vulpes, Himalayan weasel Mustela sibirica, and Himalayan yellow-throated marten Martes flavigula, Himalayan goral Naemorhedus goral, Himalayan musk deer Moschus leucogaster, Indian chevrotain Moschiola indica, Himalayan thar Hemitragus jemlahicus (VU) and serow Capricornis sumatraensis (VU). The tahr is common, the serow, goral, musk deer and bharal, blue sheep are rare. The common leopard Panthera pardus is reported from lower parts of the valley closer to the villages. Local people have also reported evidence of brown bear Ursus arctos and bharal or blue sheep Pseudois nayaur. A recent faunal survey in October 2004 has established the presence of snow leopard Panthera uncia (EN) in the national park. The area is within the West Himalayan Endemic Bird Area but there have been no surveys specific to the Valley. 114 species were seen in 1993 in Nanda Devi Park. Species frequently seen in the valley include lammergeier Gypaetus barbatus, Himalayan vulture Gyps himalayensis, yellow billed and red billed choughs Pyrrhocorax graculus and P. pyrrhocorax, koklass pheasant Pucrasia macrolopha, the nationally listed Himalayan monal pheasant Lophophorus impejanus, found in rhododendron thickets, scaly-bellied and yellow-nape woodpeckers Picus squamatus and P. flavinucha, great and bluethroated barbets Megalaima virens and M. asiatica, snow pigeon Columba leuconota and spotted dove Stigmatopelia chinensis. The area is relatively poor in reptiles: most often seen are the high altitude lizard Agama tuberculata, Himalayan ground skink Leiolopisma himalayana and Himalayan pit viper Gloydius himalayanus. Along with the flowers are wild bees and many species of butterfly which need to be more researched. A few of the more evident species are lime butterfly Papilio demoleus demoleus, <b>common</b> yellow <b>swallowtail</b> Papilio machaon, <b>common</b> Mormon Papilio polytes romulus, spangle Papilio protenor protenor and common blue apollo Parnassius hardwickei.|$|R
