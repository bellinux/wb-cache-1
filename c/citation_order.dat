40|$|Contemporary {{styles of}} music There are several areas of {{difficulty}} that plague classifiers when approaching 780 Music: � The <b>citation</b> <b>order</b> is complex; its implementation, via a class-with-the-last policy, {{is hard to}} grasp. � Not all cultures recognize a distinction between folk music and popular music. � The evolution of music styles muddies everything!

Relative to the second difficulty, we propose to supply a criterion-based characterization of 781. 62 Folk music. All styles of music that meet both of the criteria given would belong under 781. 62, unless they have already been explicitly provided for elsewhere.

40|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20 th century, Julius Otto Kaiser (1868 â 1927), a special {{librarian}} and indexer of technical literature, developed a method of knowledge organization (KO) known as systematic indexing. Certain elements of the method - its stipulation that all indexing terms be divided into fundamental categories "concretes", "countries", and "processes", which are then to be synthesized into indexing "statements" formulated according to strict rules of <b>citation</b> <b>order</b> - have long been recognized as precursors to key principles of the theory of faceted classification. However, other, less well-known elements of the method may prove no less interesting to practitioners of KO. In particular, two aspects of systematic indexing seem to prefigure current trends in KO: (1) a perspectivist outlook that rejects universal classifications in favor of information organization systems customized to reflect local needs and (2) the incorporation of index terms extracted from source documents into a polyhierarchical taxonomical structure. Kaiserâ s perspectivism anticipates postmodern theories of KO, while his principled use of polyhierarchy to organize terms derived from the language of source documents provides a potentially fruitful model that can inform current discussions about harvesting natural-language terms, such as tags, and incorporating them into a flexibly structured controlled vocabulary...|$|E
40|$|The Integrative Level Classification (ILC) {{research}} project is {{experimenting with a}} knowledge organization system based on phenomena rather than disciplines. Each phenomenon has a constant notation, which can be combined with {{that of any other}} phenomenon in a freely faceted structure. <b>Citation</b> <b>order</b> can express differential focality of the facets. Very specific subjects can have long classmarks, although their complexity is reduced by various devices. Freely faceted classification is being tested by indexing a corpus of about 3300 papers in the interdisciplinary domain of bioacoustics. The subjects of these papers often include phenomena {{from a wide variety of}} integrative levels (mechanical waves, animals, behaviour, vessels, fishing, law, [...] .) as well as information about the methods of study, as predicted in the LeÃ³n Manifesto. The archive is recorded in a MySQL database, and can be fed and searched through PHP Web interfaces. Indexer's work is made easier by mechanisms that suggest possible classes on the basis of matching title words with terms in the ILC schedules, and synthesize automatically the verbal caption corresponding to the classmark being edited. Users can search the archive by selecting and combining values in each facet. Search refinement should be improved, especially for the cases where no record, or too many records, match the faceted query.

40|$|Starting {{from some}} general {{thoughts}} on the relationship discipline-phenomenon within the Bliss bibliographic classification (2. ed.), the article offers {{an overview of the}} architecture of a specific field: economics. The difficulties in systematizing the discipline, and the quick diffusion of acronyms and new definitions - created by abbreviation or combination of existing words - lead to a full structural revision of the T entry, Economics & Management of economic enterprise, that at the moment is organized into categories, facets, and subfacets, offering a strict <b>citation</b> <b>order.</b> The system has a linear order, a notation to maintain the listing order, and an alphabetic list of the terms. BC 2 is the only example of a classifying analytic-concise architecture fully faceted, updated and coherently developed, even though it is few used outside the United Kingdom, and it still lacks a web interface representing the semantic relations of the system. The influence of BC 2 structure on computer science is shown by the FATKS project of the University College London, a project that studies the use of analytic-concise classification systems as the basis for digital resources indexing. Moreover, some ongoing experimentations are demonstrating the potential of this classification to be converted into a thesaurus; in addition, a software for supporting the semi-automatic generation of a thesaurus starting from the input files used for producing the classification and the alphabetic list, is under consideration.

40|$|The Moving Image Genre-Form Guide and Library of Congress Subject Headings are {{compared}} {{as sources of}} genre or form terms for moving image and broadcast materials. In comparing these two lists, {{it is noted that}} both seem to include a certain number of headings that are actually topical subject headings disguised as example of headings (655). Both lists contain example of headings that index categories other than genre/form, such as audience, filmmaker and the like. MIGFG has headings that are more direct than LCSH, which has many headings that begin with the terms 'Motion picture,' 'Radio,' and 'Television. ' MIGFG has a much more rigid <b>citation</b> <b>order</b> than LCSH, {{to the extent that it}} works against literary warrant. LCSH headings adhere to literary warrant much more than do MIGFG headings, that is, LCSH headings are much more likely to correspond to the terminology actually used by scholars and researchers in the moving image and broadcasting field. LCSH follows a standard approach to number and grammatical part of speech in its headings (plural nouns for genre/form headings), while MIGFG is very idiosyncratic and unpredictable in this regard, sometimes using adjectives and sometimes nouns, and seeming to prefer the singular to the plural. LCSH has a much more powerful syndetic structure than does MIGFG. MIGFG is missing many more genre and form headings that used to be present in MIM than is LCSH, which means, surprisingly, given its specialist nature, that MIGFG is less comprehensive than LCSH. LCSH is given a further edge with regard to inclusivity by the SACO program that allows users of the list to submit new genre and form headings as they are needed, and by the large editorial staff it has available to maintain the list over time. It is much easier to integrate LCSH genre and form headings into displays of LCSH topical subject headings (such as those used for works about a particular genre or form) than it is to integrate MIGFG headings into such displays. LCSH is also rich in headings for related performing arts genres and forms such as those for music, dance and theater, all of which can easily be recorded using moving image or broadcast media. Both lists contain headings that are likely to create huge unmanageable groupings over time if used as example of headings for moving image material. Based on these findings, it is recommended that any library, media collection or archive that uses LCSH for the provision of topical subject access to moving images and broadcast materials strongly consider using LCSH for genre and form access to moving images and broadcast materials as well. In addition, a number of recommendations are made for improving LCSH as a tool for form and genre access to moving image materials...|$|E
40|$|Language learner use of concordances attracts {{considerable}} research interest. Concordances are {{now being}} conceptualized as presenting language learners with multiple affordances (Leńko-Szymańska & Boulton, 2015), affordances being the latent value of an object determined by the use made of it and not necessarily by its design. However, empirical research has typically operationalized concordances in simple, monolithic terms, and thus, from an experimental design perspective, they are implicitly seen as providing a single set of language learning affordances. That is, the majority of research conducted on concordancing treatments is {{discussed in terms of}} concordancing in fairly simple undifferentiated terms (see overviews of research in Boulton, 2010 a; Cobb & Boulton, 2015; C. Yoon, 2011). Thus, previous research has contributed to an understanding of whether concordances can facilitate language learning, but it has rarely addressed the issue of how the operationalisation of concordances in pedagogical contexts interacts with the language learning affordances provided. Insufficient engagement with this issue is important because, alongside studies that have shown strong facilitative effects, there are many studies of learner use of concordances that show little to no facilitative effect of the concordancing condition. To address this issue, this thesis addresses the construct of learner use of concordances from an experiment design perspective, helping to define the construct of concordancing and examining potential variables in learner use of concordances. The thesis reports a series of studies that examine the construct of concordancing from both the perspective of concordance users’ concordancing preferences and the perspective of the lexical qualities of concordances as texts. First, a quasi-experimental, quantitative survey of concordance users’ concordancing preferences showed the construct of concordancing to comprise four distinguishable operational parameters: citation format, type of corpus concordanced, <b>citation</b> <b>order</b> and reading style. It then found correlations between these parameters and three of four user groupings: grouping by frequency of concordance use, by linguistic relationship to concordance language, and by field of concordance use. It revealed that different types of concordance user can be characterized by preferences for different types of concordance use, and vice versa. In two further studies, quantitative analysis of concordances showed that manipulation of factors in concordance generation resulted in concordances with significant differences in measures of word frequency and type token ratio. These analyses showed {{the extent to which the}} affordances of concordances vary in relation to two key factors in concordance generation: which corpus is concordanced and level of corpus generality. The findings of these four studies are discussed in relation to the definition of concordancing presented in Chapter 2 of the thesis and the affordances of concordances that have been discussed in the literature. Together the findings indicate that effective learner use of concordances is likely to be dependent on matching the operationalization of concordancing in pedagogical contexts to learner profiles. For this reason, research on learner use of concordances needs to adopt experimental designs that can account for variation in concordancing as a treatment condition. The findings are also discussed in relation to their practical implications for effectively operationalising concordancing in pedagogical practice and the development of pedagogical concordancers and concordance-based language learning materials...|$|E
