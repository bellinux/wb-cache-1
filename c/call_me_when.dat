On January 25, 2014, Cyrus sang [...] "#GetItRight" [...] during Clive Davis' party the evening before the 56th Annual Grammy Awards; after an unenthusiastic response from the audience, she performed a cover version of [...] "Jolene" [...] by Dolly Parton which received a more favorable reception. An episode of MTV Unplugged starring Cyrus premiered through MTV on January 29. She performed acoustic versions of [...] "Adore You", [...] "SMS (Bangerz)", [...] "4x4", [...] "Wrecking Ball", [...] "#GetItRight", [...] "Drive", [...] "Do My Thang", and [...] "Rooting for My Baby". Cyrus {{also performed}} a cover version of [...] "Jolene", while Madonna appeared as a surprise guest that evening to sing a medley of Cyrus [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] and her own [...] "Don't Tell Me".

2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] is {{a literal}} song which depicts the {{difficult}} situation {{of a female}} protagonist dealing with a lover who suffers from an addiction; she eventually decides {{to move away from}} this dysfunctional relationship and leave him. According to Lee, writing a song with literal meaning was an unusual practice for her. A writer for The Daily Princetonian concluded that [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] and [...] "Lithium" [...] from The Open Door were both dedicated to Lee's ex-boyfriend, with the latter song exploring his perspective of the story started by Lee in the former one. Andree Farias from Christianity Today felt that the song was [...] "self-explanatory". A Stornoway Gazette [...] writer called it a [...] "tough-love" [...] song which finds the protagonist [...] "hoping that he'll crash and burn and finally learn a lesson". In the song, Lee accuses her lover numerous times, as illustrated in the chorus lines [...] "Don't cry to me/ If you loved me/ You would be here with me" [...] and the bridge lines [...] "You never <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> you're sober/ You only want it cause it's over". The lines [...] "make up your mind" [...] repeated during the song's chorus are replaced with [...] "I've made up your mind" [...] at the end, indicating that the protagonist has moved on, eventually realizing her worth. The song closes off with Lee giggling, which was described as [...] "the proverbial last laugh".|$|E

6000|$|I went to sleep, and Jim didn't <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> {{it was my}} turn. He often done that.

He was thinking about {{his wife and his}} children, away up yonder, and he was low and homesick; because he hadn't ever been away from home before in his life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their'n. It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so. He was often moaning and mourning that way nights, when he judged I was asleep, and saying, [...] "Po' little 'Lizabeth! po' little Johnny! it's mighty hard; I spec' I ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo', no mo'!"

6000|$|... "Yes, if {{the phrase}} {{is to be}} shuttlecocked between us!" [...] I answered, hotly. [...] "There can be no {{question}} about love, or mutual regard, or difference of age, when that word is used: and were you my own father--and I love you better than a father, Uncle Lambert,--I would not bear it! What have I done? I have seen the woman whom I consider my wife before God and man, and if she calls me I will see her again. If she comes to me, here is my home for her, and the half of the little I have. 'Tis you, who have no right, having made me the gift, to resume it. Because my mother taunts you unjustly, are you to visit Mrs. Esmond's wrong upon this tender, innocent creature? You profess to love your daughter, and you can't bear a little wounded pride for her sake. Better she should perish away in misery, than an old woman in Virginia should say that Mr. Lambert had schemed to marry one of his daughters. Say that to satisfy what you call honour and I call selfishness, we part, we break our hearts well nigh, we rally, we try to forget each other, we marry elsewhere? Can any man be to my dear as I have been? God forbid! Can any woman be to me what she is? You shall marry her to the Prince of Wales to-morrow, {{and it is a}} cowardice and treason. How can we, how can you, undo the promises we have made to each other before Heaven? You may part us: and she will die as surely as if she were Jephthah's daughter. Have you made any vow to Heaven to compass her murder? Kill her if you conceive your promise so binds you: but this I swear, that I am glad you have come, so that I may here formally recall a hasty pledge which I gave, and that, <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> she will, I will come to her!" ...|$|E
60|$|The letter {{began with}} Gilbert's {{happiness}} in those from home, {{which he called}} the greatest pleasure he had ever known. He feared he had caused uneasiness by not writing sooner, {{but it had been}} out of his power while Fred Ferrars was in danger. Then followed the account of the severe illness from which Fred was scarcely beginning to rally, though that morning, on hearing that he was to be sent home as soon as he could move, he had talked about Canada and Emily. Gilbert said that not only time but strength had been wanting for writing, for attendance on Fred had been all that he could attempt, since moving produced so much pain and loss of breath, that he had been forced to be absolutely still whenever he was not wanted, but he was now much better. 'Though,' he continued, 'I do not now mind telling you that I had thought myself gone. You, who have known all my feelings, and have borne with them so kindly, will understand the effect upon me, when on the night previous to the 25th, I distinctly heard my own name, in Edmund's voice, at the head of my bed, just as he used to <b>call</b> <b>me</b> <b>when</b> he had finished his lessons, and wanted me to come out with him. As I started up, I heard it again outside the tent. I ran to the door, but of course there was nothing, nor did poor Wynne hear anything. I lay awake for some time, but slept at last, and had forgotten all by morning. It did not even occur to me when I saw the pleasant race they had cut out for us, nor through the whole affair. Do not ask me to describe it, the scene haunts me enough. When I found that I had not come off unhurt, and it seemed as if I could not ask for one of our fellows but to hear he was dead or dying, poor Wynne among them, then the voice seemed a summons. I was thoroughly done up, and could not even speak when General Ferrars came to me; I only wanted to be let alone to die in peace. I fancy I slept, for the next thing I heard was the Major's voice asking for some water, too feebly to wake the fellow who had been left in charge. I got up, and found him in a state of high fever and great pain, and from that time to the present, I have hardly thought of the circumstance, and know not why I have now written it to you. Did my danger actually bring Edmund nearer, or did its presence act on my imagination? Be that as it may, I think, after the first impression of awe and terror, the having heard the dear old voice braced me, and gave me a sense of being near home and less lonely. Not that my hurt has been for an instant dangerous, and I am mending every day; if it were warmer I should get on faster, but I cannot stir into the air without bringing on cough. Tell Ulick O'More that we entertained his brother at tea last evening, we were obliged to desire him to bring his own cup, and he produced the shell of a land tortoise; it was very like the fox and the crane. Poor fellow, it was the first good meal he had for weeks, and I was glad he came in for some famous bread that the General had sent us in. He made us much more merry than was convenient to either of us, not being in condition for laughing. He is a fine lad, and liked by all.' Then came a break, and the letter closed with such tidings of Inkermann as had reached the invalid's tent.|$|E
