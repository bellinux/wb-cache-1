40|$|In {{the early}} years of the oil and gas industry, fire in storage tanks was the common root of most of the incidents.

40|$|There has been, {{and will}} {{continue}} to be, tremendous growth in the use and distribution of liquefied natural gas (LNG). As LNG poses the hazard of flammable vapor cloud formation from a release, which may result in a massive fire, increased public concerns have been expressed regarding the safety of this fuel. In addition, regulatory authorities in the U. S. as well as all over the world expect the implementation of consequence mitigation measures for LNG spills. For the effective and safer use any safety measure to prevent and mitigate an accidental release of LNG, it is critical to understand thoroughly the action mechanisms. Water <b>spray</b> <b>curtains</b> are generally used by petro-chemical industries to prevent and mitigate heavier-than-air toxic or flammable vapors. It is also used to cool and protect equipment from heat radiation of fuel fires. Currently, water <b>spray</b> <b>curtains</b> are {{recognized as one of the}} economic and promising techniques to enhance the dispersion of the LNG vapor cloud formed from a spill. Usually, water curtains are considered to absorb, dilute, disperse and warm a heavier-than-air vapor cloud. Dispersion of cryogenic LNG vapor behaves differently from other dense gases because of low molecular weight and extremely low temperature. So the interaction between water curtain and LNG vapor is different than other heavier vapor clouds. Only two major experimental investigations with water curtains in dispersing LNG vapor clouds were undertaken during the 1970 s and 1980 s. Studies showed that water <b>spray</b> <b>curtains</b> enhanced LNG vapor dispersion from small spills. However, the dominant phenomena to apply the water curtain most effectively in controlling LNG vapor were not clearly demonstrated. The main objective of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of water <b>spray</b> <b>curtains</b> in controlling the LNG vapor clouds from outdoor experiments. A research methodology has been developed to study the dispersion phenomena of LNG vapor by the action of different water curtains experimentally. This dissertation details the research and experiment development. Small scale outdoor LNG spill experiments have been performed at the Brayton Fire Training Field at Texas A&M University. Field test results regarding important phenomena are presented and discussed. Results have determined that the water curtains are able to reduce the concentration of the LNG vapor cloud, push the vapor cloud upward and transfer heat to the cloud. These are being identified due to the water curtain mechanisms of entrainment of air, dilution of vapor with entrained air, transfer of momentum and heat to the gas cloud. Some of the dominant actions required to control and disperse LNG vapor cloud are also identified from the experimental tests. The gaps are presented as the future work and recommendation on how to improve the experiments in the future. This will benefit LNG industries to enhance its safety system and to make LNG facilities safer...|$|R
40|$|Phlebotominae sand flies (Diptera: Phlebotominae) are {{important}} vectors of leishmaniasis. Control measures are {{complicated by the}} fact that sand fly breeding sites and resting places are generally hard to find.

Therefore, new methods of biological control should be tested; entomopathogenic organisms (Bacillus sphaericus, B. thuringiensis, Beauveria bassiana), pheromone-baited traps and noxious plants could be used.

40|$|A new brute-force {{method of}} warm fog {{dispersal}} is described. The method uses large volume recycled water <b>sprays</b> to create <b>curtains</b> of falling drops {{through which the}} fog is processed by the ambient wind and spray induced air flow.

The efficiency of the technique depends upon the drop size spectra in the spray, the height to which the spray can be projected, the efficiency with which fog laden air is processed through the <b>curtain</b> of <b>spray,</b> and {{the rate at which}} new fog may be formed due to temperature differences between the air and spray water. Results of a field test program, implemented to develop the data base necessary to assess the proposed method, are presented.

40|$|Radiative {{transfer}} {{through water}} <b>spray</b> <b>curtains</b> has been presently addressed in {{conditions similar to}} devices used in fire protection systems.

Such a participating medium requires a careful treatment of its spectral response in order to model the radiative transfer accurately. This particular problem is dealt with using a correlated-K method. Radiative properties for the droplets are calculated applying the Mie theory. Transmissivities under realistic conditions are then simulated after a validation thanks to comparisons with some experimental data available in the litterature.

40|$|Nowadays, water {{curtains}} {{are often}} employed in industry to contain flammable or toxic clouds due to accidental releases of process fluids (Deaves, 1983; St-Georges et al., 1992). The action of water curtains consists, essentially, in diluting vapour clouds down to safety level from both toxic effect threshold and lower flammability limit (Mc Quaid et al., 1983). The extent of dilution {{depends on the}} effectiveness of the mechanism involved: dispersion enhancement, owing to the air entrainment and the mixing of entrained air with the vapour released; physical absorption of the released gas, eventually joined to chemical reaction; heating of gas clouds (if gas behaving like heavy ones, due to low temperature, are concerned, e. g. cryogenically liquefied LNG or ammonia gas). Recently it has been observed that the effect of mitigation could be increased by the use of a chemical solution giving a non-reversible reaction with the released substance (Griolet et al., 1995).

5000|$|In general, {{the rotary}} kilns used to {{chemically}} combine {{the raw materials}} are operated at a higher peak temperature (1600°C) than that required for gray clinker manufacture (1450°C). This requires a higher fuel consumption (typically 20-50% more), and results in lower kiln output (typically 20-50% less) for a given sized kiln. The {{reason for this is}} the relatively small amount of molten liquid produced during sintering, because of the low iron-content of the mix. The final reaction in the kiln, conversion of belite to alite, requires the melt liquid as a solvent, and is slower if the amount of melt is low. This can be partially compensated by adding to the rawmix a combination of calcium and fluoride in the form of calcium fluoride or waste cryolite. This combination lowers the melting temperature. In cases where the clinker Fe2O3 content is above 0.2% (which is almost always the case), the unique processes of [...] "bleaching" [...] and [...] "quenching" [...] are also employed. [...] "Bleaching" [...] involves directing a second flame (apart from that used to heat the kiln) onto the bed of clinker close to the kiln exit to reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II). This reduction is rigorously avoided in gray cement production, because of the deleterious effect it can have on clinker quality. But in white clinker production, where the iron content is low, this is not an issue. Subsequently, to prevent the re-oxidation of the iron, [...] "quenching" [...] is performed. This consists of rapidly lowering the clinker temperature from 1200°C to below 600°C in a few seconds, as it leaves the kiln. This usually involves dropping it into water and removing it quickly with a screw or passing it through a <b>curtain</b> of water <b>sprays.</b> This contributes to the relatively poor energy efficiency of the process, since the sensible heat of the clinker is not recycled as in normal clinker manufacturer.|$|R
40|$|Simulation of {{a process}} by means of {{physical}} models at a reduced scale is an essential tool in many application, allowing to perform {{a large number of}} experimental runs, so as to obtain a quantitative representation of the involved phenomena, at relatively low cost. Some difficulties can arise when the mathematical model derived from the simulation is applied to a real scale problem, in that the scaling of some empirical coefficients with the system size is not obvious at all. As fluid barrier scaling is a difficult task, still not deeply investigated in the scientific literature, the focus {{of this study is to}} translate knowledge from research on this topic into practice for industrial application. Following an extensive and accurate experimental work in wind tunnel, the main parameters determining the effectiveness of containment, absorption and dilution of chlorine releases were determined and a mathematical model is developed. In order to frame proper scale-up strategies, the most important result of this study rests on the explicit formulae giving, as a function of the aforesaid parameters, the single pass efficiency, the global absorption efficiency, and the toxic gas concentration downwind the barrier. In the far field, the gas concentration is practically determined only by the rate of atmospheric dispersion of the mass flow-rate of gas escaping the abatement. The absorption efficiencies are related to the drop size and to the mass transfer coefficients in the gas and liquid phases. The mean drop diameter plays an essential role in the absorption efficiency, since it simultaneously acts on air entrainment, interfacial surface and mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase. The evaluation of the mitigation effect for an industrial installation requires the scaling of the entrainment coefficient experimentally determined from wind tunnel testing. All the scaling criteria needed for adapting the proposed model to the design of a <b>spray</b> <b>curtain</b> suitable for the protection from a chlorine release, are amply discussed presenting some carefully designed simulations. Owing to its rather general structure, the model can be applied to different gaseous releases and/or absorbing solutions, provided that proper values of the parameters related with the chemical and physical absorption of the involved substances be theoretically or experimentally obtained in advance...|$|R
40|$|Liquid <b>spray</b> <b>curtains</b> are {{considered}} among the most common devices suitable to mitigate the risk connected to accidental flammable or toxic releases and jets. The effectiveness of a liquid barrier can be evaluated {{on the basis of}} several items, i. e. : the release containment effect and its ability to slow down the dispersion into the environment, so to permit the adoption of proper additional protective measures; the enhancement of the dilution of the released gas by means of the air entrained by the liquid sprays; the physical and chemical adsorption of toxic/flammable vapours by the liquid solution. It must be remarked that liquid barrier design is a complex problem to be solved, in that it requires to consider: the expected release/jet properties (flow rate, momentum, time length, chemico-physical characteristics); the meteo-climatic and geo-morphological characteristics of the site, the fluid-dynamics effects and the effectiveness of chemical/physical absorption, as a function of both the liquid flow rate and the droplet size; the optimal reagent concentration in the liquid, suitable to obtain a target removal efficiency. In this experimental and theoretical work, particular attention is dedicated to the adsorption efficiency of the curtain, both chemical and physical, in connection with the different spray characteristics. A mathematical model of a two-phase jet is developed, considering the entrained air rate in connection with the liquid flow rate. The developed model was validated by means of replicated wind tunnel experimental runs, adopting spray nozzles designed ad hoc and able to create a two-blade barrier to contain mechanically the release. The experimental phase evidenced {{that it is possible to}} distinguish two regions in the barrier: in the former, dominated by the liquid inertia, the curtain is comparable to a plane jet; in the latter, with prevalence of gravitational effects, the dimensions of the two-phase region do not vary appreciably. As regards the release mitigation, the developed mathematical model correlates both the efficiency and the adsorption rate with the liquid flow rate, the reagent concentration and the droplet size. An analytical solution of the problem is obtained, making reference to instantaneous and non-reversible chemical reactions e. g. chlorine absorption in alkaline solutions. In any case, the developed methodology can be applied to more complex situations, allowing, as well, the attainment of a more generalized approach for the design of a curtain (position, dimensioning, nozzle characteristics, liquid flow rate and characteristics), once given the release parameters, the site layout and the vulnerable target geometrical characteristics...|$|R
