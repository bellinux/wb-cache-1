25|$|The global {{financial}} crisis affected the FTF, which is required maintained its value {{in real terms}} before a distribution can be made. At 30 September 2010, the maintained value was $27.3 million; the result of <b>capital</b> <b>growth</b> and contributions from development partners. This is some $3.5 million higher than {{the market value of}} $23.8 million. The gap of 15% between the market value and the maintained value must be recouped before another distribution can be made. Since the commencement of FTF there have been four years in which distributions were made. The FTF has distributed $6.4 million with some $5.3 million allocated to island development (the balance of $1.1 million is held in reserve by the communities). This equates to an average of $55,000 spent per island per year.|$|E

25|$|Solow {{also was}} the first to develop a growth model with {{different}} vintages of capital. The idea behind Solow's vintage <b>capital</b> <b>growth</b> model is that new capital is more valuable than old (vintage) capital because new capital is produced through known technology. Within the confines of Solow's model, this known technology is assumed to be constantly improving. Consequently, the products of this technology (the new capital) are expected to be more productive as well as more valuable. The idea lay dormant for some time perhaps because Dale W. Jorgenson (1966) argued that it was observationally equivalent with disembodied technological progress, as advanced earlier in Solow (1957). It was successfully pushed forward in subsequent research by Jeremy Greenwood, Zvi Hercowitz and Per Krusell (1997), who argued that the secular decline in capital goods prices could be used to measure embodied technological progress. They labeled the notion investment-specific technological progress. Solow (2001) approved. Both Paul Romer and Robert Lucas, Jr. subsequently developed alternatives to Solow's neo-classical growth model.|$|E

2500|$|Shared {{ownership}} of the property and its deed will also entitle shareholders to certain usage rights, usually {{in the form of}} weeks.

Fractional ownership affords much of the freedom and usage benefits offered in timeshare, however, the fundamental difference with fractional ownership is that the purchaser owns part of the title (as opposed to units of [...] "time"). Therefore, if the property appreciates in value, then so do the shares.
