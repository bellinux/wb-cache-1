It is found that chemical interaction between SFC and LDPE is attributed to their overlapped pyrolysis temperature regions, leading to instant and rapid propagation and termination of macromolecular chains produced in the co-pyrolysis.

Nowadays waste disposal and incineration of polymers waste are the most frequently used methods which (i) did not allowed chemical and energy utilization and (ii) are not environmentally friendly.

40|$|Pyrolysis is an {{attractive}} alternative for the conversion of solid fuels to valuable chemicals and bio-fuels. In order to obtain more H 2 and syngas from pyrolysis of coal and biomass, microwave has been adopted to enhance the <b>co-pyrolysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> and biomass, which has been investigated systematically in this study. Firstly, conventional pyrolysis of coal and biomass was carried out using a vertical tube furnace. Characterizations of pyrolytic gas, liquid and solid products were conducted to study the different properties of products from the pyrolysis of coal and biomass. More gas products were produced at higher temperatures and biomass samples produced more H 2 and syngas than coals. Bio-oils produced from conventional pyrolysis of biomass samples have relatively simpler compositions compared with those produced from conventional pyrolysis of coals. Char samples produced from conventional pyrolysis of coal and biomass samples show different morphologies due to the different nature of original coal and biomass. Secondly, microwave-induced pyrolysis of coal and biomass was carried out and compared {{with the results of}} conventional pyrolysis. Microwave-induced pyrolysis was found to produce pyrolytic gas products with higher contents of H 2 and syngas than conventional pyrolysis. The bio-oils produced from microwave-induced pyrolysis were not as complicated as those from conventional pyrolysis. The reason for this is believed to be that both microwave irradiation and the longer residence time favour more complete decomposition of large hydrocarbon molecules in coal and biomass, which subsequently results in less complicated composition compared with bio-oil produced via conventional pyrolysis. Char samples from microwave-induced pyrolysis undergo more complete pyrolysis than char samples from conventional pyrolysis, and results in less volatiles remaining. Because of the thermal annealing process by microwave at the later stage of pyrolysis, char samples produced by microwave-induced pyrolysis have higher peak temperatures and burnout temperatures than those produced by conventional pyrolysis. In char samples prepared via microwave-induced pyrolysis of coal and biomass, special structures are found, such as nano-scale fibers in char samples from gumwood and pine, spheres in char samples from coals as well as coal and biomass blends. Based on the analysis of energy balance, it is evident that microwave-induced pyrolysis is a cost-effective and energy saving method for solid fuel conversion...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} energy {{insecurity and}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from fossil fuel utilization demands sustainable and cleaner fuel resources. Bio-fuel and chemicals from biomass have been recognized as renewable energy resource. Coal {{has the potential to}} become an important source for liquid and gas fuels. Co-processing of coal with biomass is considered a step towards sustainable and clean coal utilization. In this research work, oil palm shell (OPS) and coal were subjected to microwave (MW) pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis conditions to produce liquid fuels. Coconut activated carbon (CAC) used as a MW absorber was distributed uniformly over pyrolysis material to reduce hotspots. Three process parameters; CAC loading, MW power and nitrogen (N 2) flow rate were studied on pyrolysis performance. Initially, pyrolysis performance with 1, 2 and 3 -Layer of carbons over isolated fuels were studied. Later, 3 -Layer of carbon over isolated fuels was carried out with 35, 55 and 75 wt% CAC loading, increasing MW power and N 2 flow rate. The MW <b>co-pyrolysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> and OPS in segregation and blend were investigated to observe vapor-phase synergy. The effects of process parameters on the efficiency of co-pyrolysis of blend were tested to identify the optimal processing conditions. The highest bio-oil and coal-tar of 36. 26 wt% and 18. 59 wt% were obtained with 75 wt% CAC loading using 450 W and 600 W with 4 liters per minute (LPM) of N 2 flow rate, respectively. This improved oil recovery is mainly {{due to the fact that}} higher MW power and CAC loading produced sustained pyrolysis conditions for longer duration for the complete conversion of fuel solids. The bio-oil was enriched in phenol with highest detected 71. 77 % gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) area with 3 -Layer method at 75 wt% CAC loading, 300 W and 4 LPM of N 2 flow rate. This higher phenol formation can be attributed to the slow and uniform process heating conditions, and in-situ upgrading of pyrolysis vapors over successive carbon surfaces. The coal-tar is composed mainly of aromatics (naphthalenes, benzenes and xylene) and saturated aliphatics (alkanes and alkenes) hydrocarbons. The gas produced from pyrolysis of OPS and coal is H 2 with composition of 27. 94 – 50. 46 vol% and 40. 23 – 65. 22 vol%, respectively. The co-pyrolysis oil is composed of polars (phenol, phenolics and guaiacols) consisting of more than 50 % GC-MS area. The MW co-pyrolysis in segregation of upper-bed-coal/bottom-bed-OPS produced higher polars of 71. 62 – 76. 33 % GC-MS area with much limited aromatics and saturated aliphatics of 2. 41 – 8. 43 % and 0. 37 – 0. 80 % GC-MS area, respectively. Conversely, upper-bed-OPS/bottom-bed-coal segregated fuels produced lower polars of 50. 92 – 61. 82 % GC-MS area with much higher aromatics and saturated aliphatics of 19. 72 – 28. 29 % and 8. 22 – 21. 36 % GC-MS area, respectively. The difference in polar, aromatics and saturated aliphatics in co-pyrolysis oil shows positive vapor-phase synergy.

40|$|Coal plays a {{dominating}} role in {{the primary}} energy in China which brings serious environmental problems during its utilization. Biomass is a renewable energy. But its utilization is easily limited by seasonal restriction and its own characteristics. The co-gasification of coal and biomass can improve the conversion efficiency of biomass and reduce the emissions of contaminants. Experimental studies on co-pyrolysis of biomass and coal were performed in the thermogravimetric analyzer and in the furnace reactor. The studies were focused on possible synergetic effects between biomass and coal. The synergetic effects were studied from the yield and component of the major prolysis products. The effects of alkali and alkaline earth metals on the biomass characteristics were also studied in the thermogravimetric analyzer. A new co-pyrolysis method was introduced to use coal and biomass. In a two-stage fixed bed, the cracking characteristics of tar derived from biomass pyrolysis in coal char were studied. The main conclusions are drawn as following: (1) The results in the thermogravimetric analyzer show that in co-pyrolysis progress, the biomass volatile releasing temperature increase with increasing amount of lignite in blends. <b>Co-pyrolysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> and biomass produces more char than the summation of individual lignite and biomass pyrolysis. The synergistic effects in the co-pyrolysis of biomass and coal are suggested. The co-pyrolysis results of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin mixed with lignite show synergetic effects litte. The diameter of sample particle has no influence on the synergetic effects between biomass and coal. (2) The co-pyrolysis results of biomass and lignite in furnace reactor show that the yield of gas, liquid and char is coincide with the calculated value. But the content of H 2 in gas is lower {{and the content of}} CO and CO 2 is higher both in blends of RS/lignite and wood/lignite. The H 2 from wood/lignite blends was 5. 89 % lower than the calculated value at lignite content 50 % while CO was 4. 63 % higher. The C/H ratio of RS/lignite blends is much higher while that of wood/lignite blends is lower than expectation. Both the gas and char show synergetic effects obviously. The component of tar from blends of biomass and lignite is similar with the tar from biomass or lignite which showes additional effect only. (3) The pyrolysis results of microcrystalline cellulose (mcc) and biomass loaded K, Na, Mg, Ca investigated by thermogravimetric analysis with measurement of products by means of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (TG–FTIR) show that the catalytic effect of the metals added on the cellulose is K>Na>Mg>Ca. Potassium catalysed pyrolysis increase the char yields markedly, shift the pyrolysis process to lower temperature, and increase the light organic fraction in volatile components. The alkali metals can lower the average apparent first-order activation energy for pyrolysis. The catalysis of KCl and NaCl is relatively weak compared to KAc and NaAc. KAc and NaAc can prompt the pyrolysis of cellulose into light fractions at lower temperature, especially acids. In biomass, the organically bound alkali metals may catalyse pyrolysis of biomass more than the inorganically alkalis. (4) In a two-stage fixed bed, the cracking results of tar derived from biomass pyrolysis in a high temperature coal char show that both long residence time in char and the higher cracking temperature can decrease the tar yield with the increase of gas yield and H 2 percentage. The percentage of H 2 and CO can reach 94. 51 % at the craking temperature 1000 ℃. The prepare condition of char has influence on the gas yield and composition. Low pyrolysis temperature and short residence time can increase reactivity of coal char and is favor to the higher H 2 and CO percentage in gas. 煤炭是我国主要的化石能源，在一次能源中占主导地位，但其利用过程中排放的污染物带来了较严重的环境问题。生物质是一种清洁能源，但受到季节与自身特征的限制，其转化利用规模较小、转化效率较低。煤和生物质的共利用可以实现资源互补，提高生物质利用的转化效率、减少污染气体的排放。因此研究生物质与煤的共利用过程对于研究洁净煤技术以及污染物控制有着重要的意义。 本论文首先对煤与生物质直接混合后的共热解进行研究，在热天平反应装置和管式炉反应器中对反应特性进行分析，并对共热解过程中存在的协同效应的机理进行分析，探讨了碱/碱土元素在热解中所起的作用；最后采用一种新型共热解方式，在两段式热解炉中将生物质热解气通过灼热的煤焦层，煤焦催化裂解生物质焦油，并与气体发生气化反应转化为可燃气。经过试验，得到以下主要结论： （ 1 ）生物质与褐煤直接混合后共热解能促进固体焦产率的提高，热解过程中生物质挥发分析出温度段向高温段移动，煤析出向低温段移动。木屑与煤的共热解中起始温度tv比木屑单独热解高 10 ℃以上，协同效应最明显，生物质与煤混合后最大挥发分析出温度tmax均比单独热解高 3. 0 - 11. 8 ℃之间。说明生物质与煤共热解过程中存在协同作用。生物质中半纤维素、纤维素、木质素与褐煤共热解中热解产物分布基本与理论计算值相符，反应过程中协同效应不明显。 （ 2 ）在生物质与煤直接混合的管式炉热解实验中，对热解产物分析得到如下结论：生物质和褐煤混合热解产物分布与计算值一致，但共热解气体中H 2 的含量低于理论计算值，CO和CO 2 的实际含量略高于计算值，在煤含量为 50 %时，与计算值相比较，木屑/煤的热解气中H 2 的含量低 5. 89 %、CO高 4. 63 %，生物质与褐煤在共热解过程中发生了协同作用。稻秆与煤共热解焦中C/H比明显大于理论计算值，而木屑/煤混合热解焦的C/H比基本低于理论计算值。生物质与褐煤的共热解焦油组成基本上与单独热解焦油成份类似，协同效应不明显。 （ 3 ）添加到生物质中的四种金属元素对热解催化作用的顺序为：K> Na> Mg> Ca。碱金属能促进纤维素在较低温度下热解，能够降低纤维素的表观活化能，当纤维素中以KAc形式添加的K含量为 3. 57 %时，可使纤维素的起始热解温度降低约 115 ℃。碱金属添加量低时对纤维素热解几乎没有催化作用。碱金属存在形态对热解催化作用有影响，生物质中以有机结合态存在的碱金属对热解的催化能力大于以无机态存在的同种金属。KAc能够促进纤维素热解产物中小分子物质，尤其是羧酸类物质的生成。 （ 4 ）在两段式热解中对生物质煤焦进行分段共热解，生物质热解气经过灼热的煤焦后，气体中所携带的焦油被裂解为可燃气体。增加稻秆热解气在煤焦中的 停留时间及提高裂解温度，都有利于促进焦油裂解，高温也能促进煤焦的气化反应，使气体产率增加。裂解温度对出口端气体产率、组分影响更明显，在 1000 ℃时H 2 和CO的含量可以达到 94. 51 %。当稻秆热解气在煤焦中停留时间大于一定值后，气体中各组分和焦油裂解效率变化趋于平稳。不同热解条件所制煤焦对生物质热解气中所携带焦油裂解效果不同，降低制焦温度、缩热解时间都有利于增加煤焦的反应活性，促进焦油分解，使气体中H 2 和CO含量增加，CH 4 与CO 2 含量下降。减小煤焦颗粒直径可以增加焦油裂解率，但对气体组分影响不大...|$|E

The {{reason for}} the mixture of different biomass is to investigate the impact <b>of</b> <b>co-pyrolysis</b> on the upper phase of bio-oil in terms of changes to composition, elemental analysis, viscosity, water content, pH, higher heating value and acid number that could impact on their applications. The biomass was pyrolysed in a laboratory at 450 °C and bio-oil was collected from two cooling traps. The bio-oil obtained from <b>co-pyrolysis</b> <b>of</b> sewage sludge with wood, rapeseed and straw was analysed for composition using the gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The upper phase from the co-pyrolysis process was also characterised for ultimate analysis, higher heating values, water content, viscosity, pH and acid number. There {{was an increase in}} the amount of upper phase produced with <b>co-pyrolysis</b> <b>of</b> 40 % rapeseed. It was also found that the upper phase from sewage sludge with mixed wood has the highest viscosity, acid number and lowest pH. The bio-oil containing 40 % straw was found to have a pH of 6. 5 with a very low acid number while the 40 % rapeseed was found to have no acid number. Sewage sludge with 40 % rapeseed was found to have the highest energy content of 34. 8 MJ/kg, 40 % straw has 32. 5 MJ/kg while the 40 % mixed wood pyrolysis oil has the lowest energy content of 31. 3 MJ/kg.

The experimental results indicate that <b>co-pyrolysis</b> <b>of</b> plastic and MD {{is similar to that}} <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> and MD {{due to the fact that}} coal and plastic share some common properties, for example, they possess macromolecular structure and their thermal decomposition follow free radical mechanism. In detail, heteratomic radicals (e. g. S. and Cl.) altogether with hydrocarbon (R.) and hydrogen fragments (H.) were generated during their pyrolysis processes within the relatively lower temperature range, as a result, formation of wide range of gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons and inorganic substances with high activities, such as HCI, H 2 S, CS 2, COS and H- 2 could be rationalized in terms of typical free radical reactions including bond fission, intra-radical hydrogen abstraction, inter-radical addition, isomerization and termination, When co-existing with MD, these gaseous sulfides will react with metal oxides containing in MD to form metal sulfide with high stability and the cleaner Coke Oven Gas (COG) are obtained. Within higher temperature interval of 500 - 1000 degreesC, some of the gaseous products after pyrolysis (e. g. H 2, CO) and C in MID reinforced the reduction atmosphere necessary for the coking reaction system and accelerated the reduction of metal oxides in MD, even the gasification of metal, this is conducive to the effective removal of sulfur in coke. Therefore, it is definitely feasible to adding waste plastic and MD into coking-coal to remove the sulfur in COG and coke simultaneously...|$|R
