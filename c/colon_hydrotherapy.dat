40|$|From {{the signal}} stage of history {{surrounding}} ancient Egypt, practices of <b>colon</b> <b>hydrotherapy</b> {{in their most}} basic form – enemas or clysters – have provided people with internal cleansings adjunctive to their personal external hygiene. The Ebers Papyrus, from the 14 th century B. C. prescribes internal cleansing for no less than twenty stomach and intestinal complaints. 1 But {{in the modern era}} it fell to J. H. Kellogg, MD, of Battle Creek, Michigan, famous for his in-vention of corn flakes and various techniques of good hygiene, to popularize colon hydro-therapy. This happened from Dr. Kellogg’s publication of his article in the Journal of the Ameri-can Medical Association praising the procedure’s efficacy for saving a dysfunctional large bowel. 2 That descriptive article was the impetus for advancement of a highly beneficial therapeutic method which has since flourished and found medical recognition among enlightened healt...|$|E
40|$|<b>Colon</b> <b>Hydrotherapy</b> (CHT) {{is an old}} form of {{complementary}} medicine, {{widely used}} in former times. Nowadays, {{due to lack of}} evidence its use is criticised. The intention of CHT is the cleansing of the colon using a closed inflow/ outflow system where tempered water is administered into the colon of the patient under the control of a therapist. A systematic literature search identified only one prospective, controlled trial of poor quality which measures the effectiveness of CHT in patients with obstructed defecation disorders compared to standard therapy. Outcomes were measured by the “Modified Wexner Score”, which mean decreased from 8 (range 2 - 14) to 4. 5 (range 1 - 8) in the CHT group and from 11. 6 (range 6 - 18) to 9. 2 (range 1 - 16) in the control group. Thus the authors concluded that CHT is superior to standard therapy. Overall, CHT can be constituted as being safe. Due {{to the fact that the}} evidence about CHT is very limited, further RCTs of good quality are needed to obtain a clear picture if CHT is effective and safe for obstructed defecation disorders. ...|$|E

International Association for <b>Colon</b> <b>Hydrotherapy</b> Quarterly Spring 2011 I-ACT recommends the use of currently registered FDA equipment and only disposable speculums, rectal tubes, or rectal nozzles.

Additionally, the autoclave unit must be tested and inspected by competent authority at least four times per year- maintain documentation. (Under NO conditions should a disposable speculum or rectal tube be reused). I-ACT recognizes the FDA classifies equipment used to instill water into the colon through a nozzle inserted into the rectum to evacuate the contents of the colon into three distinct classes; Class I (Enema Kits), Class II and Class III are (Colon Irrigation Systems).
