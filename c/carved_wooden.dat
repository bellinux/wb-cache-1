5|$|The {{building}} {{dates from}} the 14thcentury, although a number of changes have since been made, particularly a substantial 19th-century restoration by SirGeorge Gilbert Scott. The church and its octagonal tower are built in red sandstone. Features of the church's interior include the lierne-vaulted ceiling of the choir, the carved stone canopies of the sedilia in the chancel, and the intricately <b>carved</b> <b>wooden</b> canopies over the choirstalls together with the 20misericords {{at the back of}} the stalls.

5|$|The solar block has two storeys and a cellar, {{and would}} have {{probably}} acted as the living space for Laurence of Ludlow when he first moved into the castle. The solar room itself is on the first floor, and is reached by external steps. The wood panelling and <b>carved</b> <b>wooden</b> fireplace are of 17th-century origin, probably from around 1640. This woodwork would have originally been brightly painted, and included spy-holes so that the hall could be observed from the solar.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{elaborate}} carved stone battle-axes found in East Lothian, Aberdenshire and Lanarkshire. These show little sign of use or wear, and so, {{rather than being}} practical objects, may be symbolic representations of power. Similarly, the site at Forteviot, in Perthshire, produced a unique warrior burial under a giant sandstone slab. The slab is engraved with a spiral and has an axehead pecked into the underside, and underneath there are grave goods of a copper dagger with leather scabbard and a <b>carved</b> <b>wooden</b> bowl.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1079 and 1532, Winchester Cathedral has had {{an unusual}} {{architectural}} history. The exterior, apart from the modified windows, gives {{the impression of a}} massive Norman building and indeed, it is the longest medieval church in the world. However, the west front is now Perpendicular, with its huge window filled with fragments of medieval glass. Inside, only the crypt and the transepts have retained their Norman appearance. The spectacular Perpendicular nave with its tall arcade arches and strong vertical emphasis has been literally carved out of the original Norman interior. The Very Rev. Sykes wrote of it “Well might the visitor who enters … by the west door gasp with amazement.” Winchester is also famous for its <b>carved</b> <b>wooden</b> fittings of many different periods.|$|E

5|$|The Unitarian Chapel retains {{much of its}} {{original}} interior, including square Corinthian columns, Oak galleries and a <b>carved</b> <b>wooden</b> pulpit. A large brass chandelier was donated to the chapel later in the 18th century by Nathaniel Webb, one the town's members of parliament. In 1881, the building's frontage was decorated with stucco to an Italianate style. Each floor is split {{by a number of}} Corinthian pilasters, and the doorway is framed by two pairs of similar identical pilasters, and topped by a triangular pediment. On the ground floor, there are four round-headed windows, while the first floor has five round-headed window bays, though the outer pairs are blocked. It was designated as a Grade II* listed building in 1952.|$|E
5|$|In 1798, Napoleon ordered this bucentaur to be destroyed, {{less for}} the sake of its golden decorations than as a {{political}} gesture to symbolize his victory in conquering the city. French soldiers broke up the <b>carved</b> <b>wooden</b> portions and the gold decorations of the ship into small pieces, carted them to the island of San Giorgio Maggiore and set fire to them to recover the gold. The ship burned for three days, and French soldiers used 400 mules to carry away its gold. The decorative elements of the vessel that survived the flames are preserved in the Museo Civico Correr in Venice, and there is a detailed scale model of the vessel in the Arsenale. The hull survived and, renamed the Prama Hydra and armed with four cannons, was stationed {{at the mouth of the}} Lido's port where it served as a coastal battery. Subsequently, the ship was returned to the Arsenale and used as a prison ship until it was entirely destroyed in 1824.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} of Texas was changed {{as a result}} of some Spanish policies. As early as the 1690s, Spaniards brought European livestock, including cattle, horses, and mules, with them on their expeditions throughout the province. Some of the livestock strayed or stayed behind when the Spanish retreated from the territory in 1693, allowing the Indian tribes to begin loosely managing herds of the animals. These herds grazed heavily on the native grasses, allowing mesquite, which was native to the lower Texas coast, to spread inland. Although the introduced livestock were able to adapt to the changing conditions, the buffalo had a more difficult time grazing among the new vegetation, beginning the decline in their numbers. Spanish farmers also introduced tilling and irrigation to the land, further changing the landscape. Spanish architectural concepts were also adopted by those in Texas, including the addition of patios, tile floors and roofs, arched windows and doorways, <b>carved</b> <b>wooden</b> doors, and wrought iron grillwork.|$|E

5|$|The palace {{building}} {{consists of}} four floors built with timber, mud bricks, clay, and soil mortar. A <b>carved</b> <b>wooden</b> gate that Yabgo Raja Hatim Khan took from a fort in Skardu after conquering most of the Baltistan was erected {{at the entrance of}} the palace. The passage beyond the main gate, which formerly housed a stable, leads to the front lawn of the palace, which was used by the musical band during festivities in the reign of Yabgo Rajas. The wooden ceiling of the palace is crafted with designs using chisel and paint, without the use of nail. A hall at the top floor that was used as a leisure room overlooks the Karakoram mountain range and the lawns around the palace. Other notable rooms of the palace include the Royal meeting room (Chogoraftal), Royal balcony (Chogojarokh), Princess dressing room (Lainakhang), and Queen room.|$|E
5|$|This pagoda, a Buddhist {{religious}} place, {{is believed}} to enshrine a bone and tooth of Gautama Buddha. The pagoda {{is in the form}} of a cone formed by five square terraces with a central solid core. There are footprints below the four standing Buddha statues here. Jataka legends are depicted on glazed terra-cotta tiles set into three rectangular terraces. At the entrance of the pagoda there are large statues of guardians of the temple. There are also four bronze standing statues of Buddha which are stated to be of the current age Buddha. At the outer limits of the pagoda there are 37 nats deified along with an intricately <b>carved</b> <b>wooden</b> sculpture of Thagyamin a Burmese version of Hindu god Indra. Within the compound of the Shwezigon Pagoda there is a stone pillar containing Mon language inscriptions dedicated by Kyansittha.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of the {{entrance}} lies the dining room, which was formerly the Jacobean great hall. The room least damaged by the fire, it was restored by Barry to its 17th century appearance, with facsimiles of the original ceiling and <b>carved</b> <b>wooden</b> screen. It contains an overmantel featuring a relief of Plenty, considered to be original, and a large stone chimneypiece, which {{is believed to be the}} only surviving work by Blore on the interior. The oak parlour, in the south west, contains a large wooden Jacobean overmantel, featuring Green Men carving. The Jacobean carving here and in the dining room is noticeably cruder than the Victorian work. The carved parlour is another reproduction by Barry of the original. Panelled in oak, it has a plaster frieze of the Elements, Graces and Virtues. The alabaster chimneypiece depicts the winged figure of Time rewarding Industry and punishing Sloth, symbolised by two boys, which is surmounted by a carved portrait of Sir Randolph Crewe.|$|E

5|$|The large {{external}} sculptural schemes of Early Gothic churches {{gave way}} to more sculpture inside the building, as tombs became more elaborate and other features such as pulpits were sometimes lavishly carved, as in the Pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in Sant'Andrea. Painted or <b>carved</b> <b>wooden</b> relief altarpieces became common, especially as churches created many side-chapels. Early Netherlandish painting by artists such as Jan van Eyck (d. 1441) and Rogier van der Weyden (d. 1464) rivalled that of Italy, as did northern illuminated manuscripts, which in the 15th century began to be collected {{on a large scale}} by secular elites, who also commissioned secular books, especially histories. From about 1450 printed books rapidly became popular, though still expensive. There were around 30,000 different editions of incunabula, or works printed before 1500, by which time illuminated manuscripts were commissioned only by royalty and a few others. Very small woodcuts, nearly all religious, were affordable even by peasants in parts of Northern Europe {{from the middle of the}} 15th century. More expensive engravings supplied a wealthier market with a variety of images.|$|E
5|$|This {{structure}} {{was built in}} the mid-15th century. At the southern end is a shallow raised dais on which the Lytes and favoured guests would have sat at a long table, facing the rest of the hall where the servants would have dined. The roof has arch-braced-collar trusses, with double purlins, and cusped curved windbraces. Typical of West Country design, these carved windbraces are both decorative and practical. Beneath is a cornice of pierced quatrefoils, and at the base of each main rafter is a <b>carved</b> <b>wooden</b> angel with a shield with the Lyte arms. The fireplace is 15th century, while the windows and the stained glass in them date from the early 16th century. The hall is entered from the east front porch via the screens passage, which would have divided the Hall from the kitchen and servants quarters' which would have lain {{to the left of the}} hall. The screen and gallery are not original, having been inserted by Sir Walter Jenner in 1907. He based the decoration on that of the arch from the Great Hall through to the Oriel Room. At the time of Jenner's arrival in 1907 the Great Hall was being used as a cider store.|$|E
5|$|The nave and chancel {{are divided}} from the aisles by seven-bay arcades, the piers being without capitals. At {{the top of}} each pier, facing the nave, is a carved human face. The roofs are divided into panels and contain much carving, {{including}} bosses (protrusions), shields, inscriptions and three pendants. The chapel at the west end of the south aisle is known as the Lady Chapel, and that on the north side is dedicated to Saint Mary. The church contains more medieval fittings and furniture than any other Cheshire church. Between the nave and the chancel is a screen, and there are parclose screens between the aisles and the chapels. The chancel screen, dated 1500, is elaborately carved with representations of birds, roses, vines and foliage. It has ten bays with lierne vaulting. The chancel stalls and the <b>carved</b> <b>wooden</b> eagle lectern date from around the same period. The lectern {{is one of the oldest}} eagle lecterns in the United Kingdom. The stalls have hinged seats, and formerly had misericords (shelves to support a standing person). Much of the furniture dates from the 17thcentury and is in Jacobean style. This includes the altar rails, the octagonal pulpit, the box pews, the reredos (screen behind the altar) in the Lady Chapel, and the font cover. The font itself is Perpendicular. The reredos in the chancel of 1866 was designed by the Manchester architect J. S. Crowther.|$|E
