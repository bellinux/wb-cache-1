5|$|Reflector sights work {{by using}} a lens or an image-forming curved mirror with a {{luminous}} or reflective overlay image or reticle at its focus, creating an optical collimator that produces a virtual image of that reticle. The image is reflected off some form of angled beam splitter or the partially silvered <b>collimating</b> curved mirror itself so that the observer (looking through the beam splitter or mirror) will see the image at {{the focus of the}} <b>collimating</b> optics superimposed in the sight's field of view in focus at ranges up to infinity. Since the optical collimator produces a reticle image made up of collimated light, light that is nearly parallel, the light making up that image is theoretically perfectly parallel with the axis of the device or gun barrel it is aligned with, i.e. with no parallax at infinity. The collimated reticle image can also be seen at any eye position in the cylindrical volume of collimated light created by the sight behind the optical window. But this also means, for targets closer than infinity, sighting towards the edge of the optical window can make the reticle move in relation to the target since the observer is sighting down a parallel light bundle at the edge. Eye movement perpendicular to the device's optical axis will make the reticle image move in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the <b>collimating</b> optics.|$|E
5|$|As {{reflector}} sight designs advanced after World War II, {{giving the}} pilot {{more and more}} information, they eventually evolved into the head-up display (HUD). The illuminated reticle was eventually replaced by a video screen at {{the focus of the}} <b>collimating</b> optics that not only gave a sighting point and information from a lead-finding computer and radar, but also various aircraft indicators (such as an artificial horizon, compass, altitude and airspeed indicators), facilitating the visual tracking of targets or the transition from instrument to visual methods during landings.|$|E
5|$|Observatories were {{constructed}} {{to the north}} and south of the mountain, plus a bothy to accommodate equipment and the scientists. Most of the workforce was however housed in rough canvas tents. Maskelyne's astronomical measurements were the first to be conducted. It was necessary for him to determine the zenith distances with respect to the plumb line for a set of stars at the precise time that each passed due south. Weather conditions were frequently unfavourable due to mist and rain. However, from the south observatory, he was able to take 76 measurements on 34 stars in one direction, and then 93 observations on 39 stars in the other. From the north side, he then conducted a set of 68 observations on 32 stars and a set of 100 on 37 stars. By conducting sets of measurements with the plane of the zenith sector first facing east and then west, he successfully avoided any systematic errors arising from <b>collimating</b> the sector.|$|E
50|$|For {{the present}} purposes, {{the light from}} a star can {{be treated as a}} {{practically}} <b>collimated</b> beam, but apart from this, a <b>collimated</b> beam is rarely if ever found in nature, though artificially produced beams can be very nearly <b>collimated.</b> For some purposes the rays of the sun can be considered as practically <b>collimated,</b> because the sun subtends an angle of only 32′ of arc. The specific (radiative) intensity is suitable for the description of an uncollimated radiative field. The integrals of specific (radiative) intensity with respect to solid angle, used for the definition of spectral flux density, are singular for exactly <b>collimated</b> beams, or may be viewed as Dirac delta functions. Therefore the specific (radiative) intensity is unsuitable for the description of a <b>collimated</b> beam, while spectral flux density is suitable for that purpose.|$|R
50|$|Light can be {{approximately}} <b>collimated</b> {{by a number}} of processes, for instance by means of a collimator. Perfectly <b>collimated</b> light is sometimes said to be focused at infinity. Thus, as the distance from a point source increases, the spherical wavefronts become flatter and closer to plane waves, which are perfectly <b>collimated.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{the present}} purposes, {{the light from}} a star, and for some {{particular}} purposes, {{the light of the}} sun, can be treated as a practically <b>collimated</b> beam, but apart from this, a <b>collimated</b> beam is rarely if ever found in nature, though artificially produced beams can be very nearly <b>collimated.</b> The spectral radiance (or specific intensity) is suitable for the description of an uncollimated radiative field. The integrals of spectral radiance (or specific intensity) with respect to solid angle, used above, are singular for exactly <b>collimated</b> beams, or may be viewed as Dirac delta functions. Therefore, the specific radiative intenstity is unsuitable for the description of a <b>collimated</b> beam, while spectral flux density is suitable for that purpose. At a point within a <b>collimated</b> beam, the spectral flux density vector has a value equal to the Poynting vector, a quantity defined in the classical Maxwell theory of electromagnetic radiation.|$|R
5|$|Since the {{collimated}} image {{produced by}} the sight is only truly parallax free at infinity, the sight has an error circle equal to {{the diameter of the}} <b>collimating</b> optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind the sight and the closeness of the target this induces some aiming error. For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of the sight) this aiming error is considered trivial. On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle {{in the middle of the}} optical window (sighting down its optical axis). Some manufacturers of small arms sights also make models with the optical collimator set at a finite distance. This gives the sight parallax due to eye movement the size of the optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance (somewhere around a desired target range of 25-50 yards).|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a <b>collimating</b> lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E
25|$|The way {{in which}} the beam profile of a laser beam changes as it propagates is {{determined}} by diffraction. When the entire emitted beam has a planar, spatially coherent wave front, it approximates Gaussian beam profile and has the lowest divergence for a given diameter. The smaller the output beam, the quicker it diverges. It is possible to reduce the divergence of a laser beam by first expanding it with one convex lens, and then <b>collimating</b> it with a second convex lens whose focal point is coincident with that of the first lens. The resulting beam has a larger diameter, and hence a lower divergence.|$|E
40|$|A {{reconfigurable}} <b>collimated</b> radiation detector, {{system and}} related method includes {{at least one}} <b>collimated</b> radiation detector. The detector has an adjustable collimator assembly including at least one feature, such as a fin, optically coupled thereto. Adjustments to the adjustable collimator selects particular directions of travel of scattered radiation emitted from an irradiated object which reach the detector. The <b>collimated</b> detector is preferably a <b>collimated</b> detector array, where the collimators are independently adjustable. The independent motion capability provides the capability to focus the image by selection of the desired scatter field components. When an array of reconfigurable <b>collimated</b> detectors is provided, separate image data {{can be obtained from}} each of the detectors and the respective images cross-correlated and combined to form an enhanced image...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Collimated</b> {{light is}} light whose rays are parallel, and {{therefore}} will spread minimally as it propagates. A perfectly <b>collimated</b> beam, with no divergence, would not disperse with distance. Such a beam cannot be created, due to diffraction.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn exact {{formulation}} for {{the source}} function, the radiative flux, and the intensity is presented for a two-dimensional, finite, planar, isotropically scattering medium. Exact expressions are obtained for both <b>collimated</b> and diffuse radiation. Cosine varying <b>collimated</b> and diffuse radiation is considered in detail. The solution for the cosine varying <b>collimated</b> radiation model is used to construct the solutions for the other boundary conditions. The two-dimensional integral equations are reduced to one-dimensional equations by the method of separation of variables...|$|R
500|$|Open sights (also {{known as}} [...] "mini reflex sights" [...] and [...] "mini red dots") take {{advantage}} {{of the fact that the}} reflector sight's only optical element, the optical window, doesn't need any housing at all. This configuration consists of a base with just the necessary reflective surface for <b>collimating</b> the reticle mounted on it. Due to their diminished profile, open sights do not usually accommodate filters and other accessory options typically supported by tube designs.|$|E
500|$|A {{common type}} (used in {{applications}} such as aircraft gun sights) uses a <b>collimating</b> lens and a beam splitter. This type tends to be bulky since it requires at least two optical components, the lens and the beam splitter/glass plate. The reticle collimation optics are situated at 90° to the optical path making lighting difficult, usually needing additional electric illumination, condensing lenses, etc. A more compact type replaces the lens/beam splitter configuration with a half silvered or dichroic curved <b>collimating</b> mirror set at an angle that performs both tasks of focusing and combining {{the image of an}} offset reticle. This type is most often seen as the red dot type used on small arms. It is also possible to place the reticle between the viewer and the curved mirror at the mirror's focus. The reticle itself is too close to the eye to be in focus but the curved mirror presents the viewer with an image of the reticle at infinity. This type was invented by Dutch optical engineer Lieuwe Van Albada in 1932, originally as a camera viewfinder, and was also used as a gunsight on World War II bazookas: the US M9 and M9A1 [...] "Bazooka" [...] featured the D7161556 folding [...] "Reflecting Sight Assembly".|$|E
500|$|Collimator sights (also called <b>collimating</b> or [...] "occluded eye gunsight" [...] (OEG)) {{are simply}} the optical {{collimator}} focusing a reticle without any optical window. The viewer cannot see through them and only sees {{an image of}} the reticle. They are used either with both eyes open while one looks into the sight, with one eye open and moving the head to alternately see the sight and then at the target, or using one eye to partially see the sight and target at the same time. The reticle is illuminated by an electric, radioluminescent or passive ambient light source. The Armson OEG and the Normark Corp. Singlepoint are two examples of commercially available ambient lit collimator sights. These sights have the advantage of requiring less illumination for the reticle for the same level of usability, due to the high contrast black background behind the reticle. For this reason occluded eye gunsights were more practical for use on small arms before low power consumption illumination sources such as LEDs became commonplace.|$|E
50|$|A perfect {{parabolic}} mirror will bring parallel rays to a focus {{at a single}} point. Conversely, a point source at {{the focus of a}} {{parabolic mirror}} will produce a beam of <b>collimated</b> light creating a Collimator. Since the source needs to be small, such an optical system cannot produce much optical power. Spherical mirrors are easier to make than parabolic mirrors and they are often used to produce approximately <b>collimated</b> light. Many types of lenses can also produce <b>collimated</b> light from point-like sources.|$|R
40|$|<b>Collimated</b> {{directional}} emission {{is essentially}} required an asymmetric resonant cavity. In this paper, we theoretically investigate {{a type of}} peanut-shaped microcavity which can support highly directional emission with the emission divergence as small as 2. 5 o. The mechanism of the <b>collimated</b> emission is explained with the short-term ray trajectory and the intuitive lens model in detail. Wave simulation also confirms these results. This extremely narrow divergence of the emission holds a great potential in highly <b>collimated</b> lasing from on-chip microcavities...|$|R

When RTP is used, <b>collimated</b> TiN of much smaller thickness than the furnace-annealed <b>collimated</b> TIN shows reliable electrical contact properties withoutjunction leakage failure at subhalf micron contacts.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was the dosimetric {{characterization}} of a mini-beam collimator on three clinically beam matched Varian iX linear accelerators. Measurements of the beam quality (%DD(10)), peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR), collimator factor (CF), and relative output factor (OF) were carried out for 2 cm x 2 cm, 3 cm x 3 cm, 4 cm x 4 cm, and 5 cm x 5 cm mini-beam <b>collimated</b> 6 MV fields on each linear accelerator. As well, Monte Carlo simulation of the mini-beam <b>collimated</b> fields were used to link the measurement results to a validated linear accelerator model. The quality of the mini-beam <b>collimated</b> field was clinically equivalent to that of the open field. Changes in the mini-beam <b>collimated</b> field in response to changes in both field size and collimator inclination were consistent across all three linear accelerators. However, PVDR, collimator factors, and relative output factors varied in excess of the measurement uncertainty, revealing a difference in the mini-beam <b>collimated</b> fields of each linear accelerator. The change in PVDR was proportional to that of the collimator factor and relative output factor. The Monte Carlo simulations showed that variation in the full-width half-maximum of the linear accelerators’ electron beam incident on the Bremsstrahlung target correlated to the variation in collimator factor and PVDR across the accelerators. These results demonstrate that while the mini-beam <b>collimated</b> field varies across linear accelerators, the effect can be accounted for in the linear accelerator model, allowing the planning and delivery of mini-beam <b>collimated</b> fields using medical linear accelerators...|$|R
