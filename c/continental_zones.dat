5|$|Although the 2012 Olympic men's {{basketball}} tournament was then {{more than a}} year away, qualifying tournaments in all five of FIBA's <b>continental</b> <b>zones</b> were to be held in the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2011 (the traditional basketball offseason throughout the world). The lockout resulted in the suspension of an agreement between the NBA and FIBA by which the NBA would take on most of the costs for insuring the value of its players' contracts in the event they were injured during international competition. As a result, national federations that wish to have NBA players on their squads must now provide full coverage instead of supplemental insurance.|$|E
5|$|The tournament sees players {{competing}} {{for their country}} in four singles and one doubles matches, known as rubbers, {{over the course of}} three days, with the team that wins three rubbers progressing. The countries are divided into groups based upon their location or performance in previous years. The Davis Cup World Group is the top level of the competition and features matches between players from the top 16 countries {{at the start of the}} year. Countries that lose their first round match face a relegation play-off against winning countries from the <b>continental</b> <b>zones.</b> World Group winning countries progress to the quarter-finals. Nations have to win a further three ties in order to claim the position of Davis Cup Champions.|$|E

25|$|Considering its {{relatively}} small area, Bulgaria has variable and complex climate. The country occupies the southernmost {{part of the}} <b>continental</b> climatic <b>zone,</b> with small areas in the south falling within the Mediterranean climatic <b>zone.</b> The <b>continental</b> <b>zone</b> is predominant, because continental air masses flow easily into the unobstructed Danubian Plain. The continental influence, stronger during the winter, produces abundant snowfall; the Mediterranean influence increases {{during the second half}} of summer and produces hot and dry weather. Bulgaria is subdivided into five climatic zones: <b>continental</b> <b>zone</b> (Danubian Plain, Pre-Balkan and the higher valleys of the Transitional geomorphological region); transitional zone (Upper Thracian Plain, most of the Struma and Mesta valleys, the lower Sub-Balkan valleys); continental-Mediterranean zone (the southernmost areas of the Struma and Mesta valleys, the eastern Rhodope Mountains, Sakar and Strandzha); Black Sea zone along the coastline with an average length of 30–40km inland; and alpine zone in the mountains above 1000m altitude (central Balkan Mountains, Rila, Pirin, Vitosha, western Rhodope Mountains, etc.).|$|R

40|$|This work {{is meant}} to {{demonstrate}} that, in the special synoptic conditions, {{on the surface of}} the Black Sea, a baric depression is being formed. This depression is formed when the Black Sea's water temperature is higher than the surrounding continental ground's temperature. There are situations when the baric depression of the Black Sea occurs because of the consequences of the movement of another baric depression from the east of the Mediterranean Sea to its north-east side. Due to the high atmospheric pressure of the <b>continental</b> <b>zone</b> that's surrounding the Black Sea, the baric depression will get a retrograde movement, towards the north or northwest. Eventually, this depression occludes in the eastern <b>continental</b> <b>zone</b> of Europe or even near the Baltic Sea.
