5|$|Notwithstanding {{the level}} of {{controversy}} surrounding cost, the Scottish Parliament Building proved controversial {{in a number of}} other respects: the decision to construct a new building, the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>site,</b> the selection of a non-Scottish architect, and the selection of Bovis as construction manager after having earlier been excluded from the shortlist. In 1997, the initial cost of constructing a new Parliament building was given as £40 million, a figure produced by the Scottish Office, prior to the September 1997 devolution referendum, and subsequently revealed to be the figure for housing MSPs. Further controversy surrounding the project sprang from the selection of the Holyrood site, which was a late entrant onto the list of sites to be considered, and the rejection of the Royal High School on Calton Hill, long thought to be the home of any future devolved Scottish Parliament. After a formal visit to the Royal High School by Dewar and his aides on 30 May 1997, it was rejected as unsuitable on the grounds of size and location.|$|E

A Green Building can thus be defined as a high-performance building designed, built, operated and disposed of in a resource-efficient manner with the aim to minimize the overall (negative) impact on the built environment, human health and the natural environment.

25|$|The post-338 Latin colonies {{comprised}} 2,500–6,000 {{adult male}} settlers (average 3,700) {{based on an}} urban centre with a territorium of an average size of 370km². The territorium would frequently consist {{of some of the}} defeated people's best agricultural land, since the social function of colonies was to satisfy the Romans' land-hungry peasantry. But the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>site</b> for a colonia was primarily dictated by strategic considerations. Coloniae were situated at key geographical points: the coasts (e.g. Antium, Ariminum), the exits to mountain passes (Alba Fucens), major road intersections (Venusia) and river fords (Interamna). Also colonies would be sited to provide a defensive barrier between Rome and her allies and potential enemies, as well as to separate those enemies from each other and keep watch on their activity: a divide-and-rule strategy. Thus Rome's string of colonies and eventual annexation of a belt of territory across the centre of the Italian peninsula was driven by the strategic aim of separating the Etruscans from the Samnites and interdicting a potential coalition of these powerful nations.|$|E

500|$|Pressure for an {{independent}} parliament grew in the 1970s {{with the growth of}} the Scottish National Party and monies were invested into the conversion of the former Royal High School on Calton Hill into an official parliament. Whilst much of this conversion was completed (including creation of the main debating hall) and the building was renamed New Parliament House it was determined that the facility was too small for its stated purpose (as and when that purpose arose). Following the April 1992 election, when a weakened John Major was re-elected, a campaign group set up adjacent to the Royal High School {{at the foot of the}} access road to Calton Hill. Starting informally this became a permanently manned [...] "vigil" [...] to keep the concept in the public mind. This led to the Royal High School being the [...] "popular" [...] <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>site</b> in the public (and particularly SNP) mindset.|$|E

60|$|Yet {{during the}} first {{settlement}} of the country, the region was not unproductive. Here {{it was that the}} original settlers came, acting upon the principle well known to have regulated their <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>site,</b> namely, the high land in preference to the low, as less subject to the unwholesome miasmas generated by breaking into the rich valleys and alluvial bottoms of primeval regions. By degrees, however, they quitted the safety of this sterile elevation, to brave the dangers of richer though lower fields. So that, at the present day, some of those mountain townships present an aspect of singular abandonment. Though they have never known aught but peace and health, they, in one lesser aspect at least, look like countries depopulated by plague and war. Every mile or two a house is passed untenanted. The strength of the frame-work of these ancient buildings enables them long to resist the encroachments of decay. Spotted gray and green with the weather-stain, their timbers seem to have lapsed back into their woodland original, forming part now of the general picturesqueness of the natural scene. They are of extraordinary size, compared with modern farmhouses. One peculiar feature is the immense chimney, of light gray stone, perforating the middle of the roof like a tower.|$|E

Slight differences are seen however in drinking ware, which are frequent and of greater volume in the graves of deceased males...|$|R
5000|$|A {{rigorous}} {{evaluation of}} the MVP is impossible due to shortcomings in the project's evaluation design which include the [...] "subjective <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> intervention <b>sites,</b> the subjective <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> comparison <b>sites,</b> the lack <b>of</b> baseline data on comparison sites, the small sample size, and the short time horizon". A self-published assessment comparing villages three years into the project to how they were initially estimated large impacts on health, agricultural yield, {{and a variety of}} other measures. As some of this may have been due to regional improvements unrelated to the MVP, an independent evaluation comparing the MV to surrounding areas finds the effects are much more modest. An additional independent evaluation found that while agricultural productivity increased, final household income was not increased by the MVP.|$|R
