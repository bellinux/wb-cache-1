25|$|Although {{the reserve}} covers {{a large portion}} of Honduras, very little is {{recorded}} about the biological diversity within it. While previous management plans have proven successful, a continued investigation into ongoing management plans and future conservation issues will be necessary to keep this valuable reserve safe. Currently there are threats to the conservation of the reserve which include illegal hunting, logging and clearing of land to graze cattle. Recent rafting expeditions from the Rio Plátano headwaters through all three zones of the reserve (cultural, buffer and core) have documented cattle grazing in the core zone, commercial fishing and hunting camps along the river and <b>clear</b> <b>cutting</b> of forest near Las Marias.|$|E
25|$|Cargill, a {{multinational}} company which controls {{the majority of}} the soya bean trade in Brazil has been criticized, along with fast food chains like McDonald's, by active groups such as Greenpeace for speeding up the process of the deforestation of the Amazon. Cargill is the main supplier of soya beans to large fast food companies such as McDonald's which uses the soya products to feed their cattle and chickens. As fast food chains expand, fast food chains must increase the quantity of their livestock in order to produce more products. In order to meet the large demands of soya, Cargill is forced to expand its soya production by <b>clear</b> <b>cutting</b> parts of the Amazon.|$|E
500|$|On November 3, Sony Music {{released}} , comprising 8 CDs and 1 DVD. Trouble No More documents what Rolling Stone {{described as}} Dylan's [...] "Born Again Christian period of 1979 to 1981 - an intense, wildly controversial time that produced three albums {{and some of}} the most confrontational concerts of his long career." [...] Reviewing the box set in The New York Times, Jon Pareles wrote, [...] "Decades later, what comes through these recordings above all is Mr. Dylan’s unmistakable fervor, his sense of mission. The studio albums are subdued, even tentative, compared with what the songs became on the road. Mr. Dylan’s voice is <b>clear,</b> <b>cutting</b> and ever improvisational; working the crowds, he was emphatic, committed, sometimes teasingly combative. And the band tears into the music." [...] Trouble No More includes a DVD of a film directed by Jennifer Lebeau consisting of live footage of Dylan's gospel performances interspersed with sermons delivered by actor Michael Shannon.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the formation of}} pine plantations established by planting of container seedlings on <b>clear</b> <b>cuttings</b> with and without soil scarification. Experimental plantations were laid down {{in the framework of}} “Taiga – Model Forest” international project in the Republic of Karelia in triplicate for each case and continued for 12 years. An old overgrown pine <b>clear</b> <b>cuttings</b> with fresh green moss on podzolic illuvial iron-rich sandy loam soils was planted by container seedlings, two-year bareroot seedlings and sowing. It was shown that forest regeneration material and soil preparation play important roles within the first 6 years. Five years’ pine plantations regenerated by container seedlings with soil scarification had 1. 35 m average height and 98 % survival rate, container seedlings without soil scarification had 0. 8 m average height and 63 % survival rate and sowings 0. 57 m average height and 15 – 55 % survival rate in the seed area. The bare-root seedlings had the same average height and survival rate as container seedlings. Substantiated density planting of container seedlings for Southern Karelia is 2500 seedlings per ha. After 10 – 12 years of planting the forest regeneration material and soil reparation influenced to a lesser extent on the growth of the pine plantations and the difference between the options of experience has become less significant...|$|R

30|$|While {{suggesting}} {{to shorten the}} rotation length in production forests, we point at the effects of present management regulations on the age structure which is highly unbalanced. Shortening the rotation length, for instance by skipping the current no-cut period, would help to avoid <b>clear</b> <b>cuttings,</b> and to limit the illegal flow of timber coming from uncontrolled sanitation cuttings. In Germany the open canopy cover of old stands allows for natural regeneration before harvest rather than of plantations after felling of dense old stands. Thus, with proper management, the clear felling could be abandoned even in Norway spruce stands (Thueringen 2015). An increased productivity would also mean that more forest could be put under protection by land-sharing without affecting the country-level wood supply.|$|R
