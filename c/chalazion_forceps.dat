40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of chronic suppurative lacrimal canaliculitis treatment using <b>chalazion</b> <b>forceps.</b> Patients and Methods: A prospective study was performed on consecutive patients who accepted the aid of <b>chalazion</b> <b>forceps</b> to treat chronic suppurative lacrimal canaliculitis. Two different treatment methods using <b>chalazion</b> <b>forceps</b> were performed according to the degree of lacrimal canaliculitis. Postoperatively, the patients received 0. 5 % levofloxacin eye drops four times per day and 0. 5 g oral levofloxacin tablets once per day for 4 days. The follow-up period was more than 3 months. Lacrimal irrigation, the condition of the lacrimal punctum, and patients′ symptoms were carefully evaluated. Results: In total, 32 patients met the criteria for chronic suppurative lacrimal canaliculitis. Included were 6 males and 26 females. Their average age was 51. 7 ± 14. 9 years (range; 19 - 80 years), and all had unilateral canaliculitis. The mean duration of the symptoms was 18. 9 ± 9. 8 months (range; 3 - 48 months). The mean follow-up time was 14. 7 ± 7. 8 months. The signs and symptoms resolved completely in all patients within 15 days, and no recurrence was observed. No patients reported epiphora after the treatment. Conclusions: The use of <b>chalazion</b> <b>forceps</b> is effective in treating chronic suppurative lacrimal canaliculitis. The forceps may offer an alternative treatment technology in the management of suppurative lacrimal canaliculitis...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{review the}} {{existing}} techniques for minor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB) in the lip {{and to suggest}} {{a new approach to}} ease the procedure and reduce post-operative complications. Study Design: A comprehensive literature review and a descriptive study of a new surgical technique. Results: Diverse incisions have been suggested for MSGB with different designs (ellipse, circular, linear), different directions (parallel, oblique, vertical) and a wide range of lengths (from 1 mm up to 3 cm), but no comparative studies supporting the advantages of a particular type of incision over the others could be retrieved. A variety of features of the existing techniques for MSGB are linked to undesired events and surgical complications which could be minimized by modifying certain aspects of these procedures. The technique described, together {{with the use of the}} S forceps, represents a significant improvement over the already described <b>chalazion</b> <b>forceps</b> because it allows for a better access and positioning of the lower lip, improves the ergonomic conditions of the assistant, and facilitates the identification of lip areas with more superficial gland lobules. Conclusions: The suggested approach for lip MSGB includes a specifically designed instrument whose performance during lip biopsy may contribute to minimize post-operative complications.
