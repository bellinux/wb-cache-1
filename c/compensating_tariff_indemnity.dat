We stress the study of fiscal policies that the government could tap in order to <b>compensate</b> for <b>tariff</b> revenue loss. This {{is a very important}} issue for Ecuador because this country adopted the US dollar as its currency in 2000, forgiving the use of important policy instruments. To study these issues we combine a reduced-form micro household income and occupational choice model (using 2005 / 6 data from the Ecuadorian LSMS) with a standard single-country computable general equilibrium model (employing a 2004 SAM). We follow a sequential approach that simulates the full distributional impact of trade and tax policies. We find that the impact of these policy changes on extreme poverty and income distribution is small but positive...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} quantifies {{the effects}} on poverty in Ecuador of bilateral trade liberalization with the U. S. and fiscal changes (value added tax and direct taxes) which seek to <b>compensate</b> <b>tariff</b> revenue losses, so that the government deficit remains constant. This {{is a very important}} issue for Ecuador because it adopted the U. S. dollar as its currency in 2000, forgoting the use of monetary and exchange rate policy instruments. This paper highlights labor market effects and fiscal policies as the main mechanisms through which trade impacts poverty. The paper combines a reduced-form micro household income and occupational choice model (using the 2005 / 6 Ecuadorian household survey) with a standard single-country computable general equilibrium model (employing a 2004 Social Accounting Matrix). A sequential approach that simulates the full income and distributional impact of trade and tax policies is followed. The impact of these policy changes on the economy is small. Indigence and income distribution effects are small but positive. There are mixed results on poverty. The best poverty reduction outcomes are attained when only direct taxes are used for making up tariff revenue losses and the worst when a flat VAT rate is employed, including the elimination of current VAT exemptions (mostly for agricultural goods). A key contribution of this research is to illustrate the significance for poverty of policy choices available to the government.

Using a CGE-microsimulation analysis, tariff cuts between 1994 and 2000 are shown to have been generally poverty-reducing. This is due to a fall in consumer prices and, to <b>compensate</b> lost <b>tariff</b> revenue, an increase in direct taxes that primarily hits the non-poor.

We also show that these results are highly sensitive to behavioral shifts in exports. Since such shifts are quite likely given the nature of the trade reform currently being undertaken, it is important that we qualify our results accordingly. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} theory of product promotion {{has been developed}} {{within the framework of}} the theory of imperfect competition and under rather restrictive conditions. Application of these theories to rural product promotion is, in most cases, of limited value. This paper first examines some characteristics of agricultural product markets which necessitate modification of standard promotion theory. Some further complex issues in promotion theory as it relates to agricultural products are then examined. These include the stabilization of funds fOl financing promotion expenditures, promotion strategy under price discrimination schemes characteristic of several Australian primary product markets, the welfare consequences of promotion by primary producer promotion cartels, possible terms of trade effects of overseas promotion expenditures, and subsidies for rural product promotion as a form of <b>tariff</b> <b>compensating</b> income transfers.

40|$|In this {{teaching}} note, {{we discuss}} the basic principles for tariff setting. Tariff setting {{is very important for}} regulated industries, such as water and power. The tariff should provide an appropriate risk-adjusted return to the investor. If the tariff were too low, then the investors would not be willing to invest. On the other hand, if the tariff were too high, then it would reduce the consumers’ welfare. We examine the Rate of Return method for calculating the tariff in a regulated firm. In the rate of return method, the <b>tariff</b> <b>compensates</b> the investor for all the costs that the investor incurs, including a fair return. We use the discounted cash flow approach to value the return that the investor receives. The results of both calculations must be consistent. In particular, using simple examples, we show that {{in the presence of a}} positive expected inflation rate, the typical tariff calculation, Rate of return method, is an overestimation of the required payment to the equity holder. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{potential}} impact of acarbon tax on the economy of the Philippines and on the livelihood of its people. It focuses on the interaction between such a tax and the country's ongoing trade liberalization programme. With energy use on the rise in the Philippines, increases in greenhouse gas emissions are almost inevitable. The policy most widely recommended by economists - a carbon tax - may be an efficient {{way to deal with the}} problem, but there is concern about its distributional effects. The study finds that a carbon tax would <b>compensate</b> for any <b>tariff</b> revenues lost through a reduction in trade tariffs. It also finds that the tax would reduce poverty and increase people's welfare. Imposing a carbon tax during the ongoing trade liberalization process - provided the carbon tax is used to reduce income taxes -is a sensible approach that could meet the country's economic, environmental and equity objectives. tariff, carbon emissions, poverty, Philippines...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to assess the {{possible}} impacts of the Doha round of negotiations on poverty in Cameroon. During the recent period of economic recovery, Cameroon has enjoyed {{a sharp decline in}} poverty with the headcount index falling from 53. 3 percent of inhabitants in 1996 to 40. 2 percent in 2001, mostly thanks to economic growth rather than redistribution. Will the current trade negotiations under the Doha Round reinforce or curb this trend? We apply a CGE microsimulation model which involves 10, 992 households in order to address this question. The Doha Round is found to be poverty reducing for Cameroon. For the whole country, the estimate of net {{number of people who are}} lifted out of poverty is 22, 000 following this scenario. Further investigations indicate that more ambitious world trade liberalization leads to greater poverty alleviation at the national level, while Cameroon's domestic trade liberalization has adverse poverty and inequality impacts - despite giving rise to higher aggregate welfare. Under the Doha scenario, the cuts in Cameroon's tariffs in the Doha scenarios are very small (the average tariff rate moves from 11. 79 percent in the base run to merely 11. 66 percent) so that ROW liberalization effects on world prices more than offset the adverse own liberalization effects in this scenario. If the Rest of the World (ROW) and Cameroon full trade liberalizations are combined, the adverse impacts of own liberalization outweigh the favourable outcomes of the ROW liberalizations. Our results suggest furthermore that the choice of tax replacement instrument canhaave an important bias in poverty impacts: poverty gets worse in our country-case study when using an imperfect VAT instead of a neutral replacement tax to <b>compensate</b> lost <b>tariff</b> revenue, and gets even worse when using consumption tax.

40|$|The path to Turkey-EU {{integration}} has {{not been}} a straightforward one. It has historical, cultural and political as well as economic dimensions. Within this wide spectrum, the purpose of this thesis is to analyze the implications of integrating Turkey 2 ̆ 7 s agricultural sector with that of the EU. As the first study to investigate the implications of extending the CU to include agriculture in a multi-sector, multi-region general equilibrium framework, this thesis addresses some of the key issues such as welfare effects, sectoral reallocations, agricultural unskilled labor mobility, revenue replacement and the cost of integration on the EU budget. The results indicate that much of the benefit of agricultural integration for Turkey will be conditional upon the availability of EU budget transfers to cover anticipated production subsidies. As long as EU budget transfers can be ensured, then agricultural integration will be beneficial to Turkey in terms of aggregate welfare. Primary agricultural and food sectors expand in this case, leading to increased employment and export possibilities. However, the implied cost of agricultural integration with full harmonization of protection structure on the EU budget is nontrivial: 9. 6 billion (in 1995 US). When the EU budget transfers are disregarded, then the benefits of agricultural integration vanish. Both unilateral agricultural liberalization by Turkey on a Most Favored Nation Basis and multilateral liberalization by all regions as alternative policy options are more favorable than agricultural integration with the EU in the absence of budget transfers. This thesis also explores the implications of alternative assumptions about unskilled labor mobility and revenue replacement. The results indicate that unskilled labor mobility will be essential in determining the impact of trade policy reforms. As far as the implications of agricultural integration on government finance is concerned, the results indicate that Turkey has to increase value-added taxes by one-quarter in order to <b>compensate</b> for <b>tariff</b> revenue loss due to integration when production subsidies are not covered by the EU. This will negatively affect the projected welfare gains. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a political economy {{analysis of the}} difficulties of liberalizing tariffs in Egypt in general and in its specific industries. The theoretical and empirical models are presented and results are discussed. We also explore the potential effects of the EuroMed agreement for Egypt. The political economy analysis of the Egyptian tariff structure allows for the identification of two sets of highly protected sectors. Over-protected industries are defined as those with actual tariffs at least 25 percent higher than what is predicted by the political economy variables used in the analysis. The political determinants we use {{can be divided into}} two groups: the lobbying and counter-lobbying forces. First, the lobbying strength of specific capital in each sector is proxied by the degree of industry concentration, the labor-capital ratio, and the import penetration ratio. Second, counterlobbying in factor or input markets is proxied by wage level, degree of processing in the industry, and degree of intra-industry trade. Using this political economy methodology, we identify two sets of products: six products where tariff cuts will not be politically costly and six where it will be politically costly. In both cases, lowering tariffs will improve resource allocation and efficiency in the industries involved. The prospects of a Free Trade Area (FTA) with Europe should also help reduce tariffs in sectors where a high share of production is exported or imported from Europe. If products are exported to Europe, the potential free access to the European market should more than <b>compensate</b> for any <b>tariff</b> reductions in the local market.

40|$|Despite {{attempts}} to liberalize India's import trade regime, {{the structure of}} import licensing is still restrictive and complex and for most products, trade restrictions are probably redundant as protection. Reforming export policies alone - without reforming India's import and tax systems - will produce only marginal improvements. Problems in the export administration can be resolved only by making changes in four areas. (1) The import licensing system must be rationalizedto eliminate import restrictions on inputs and components. The import regime inflicts heavy administrative costs on the Indian economy. Imports of raw materials and other inputs essential for production are delayed, leaving downstream producers idle when domestic supplies are interrupted (which happens often). The export regime is still not rationalized for smaller producers, indirect exporters, and firms that rely on domestic suppliers. (2) Tariffs and excise taxes must be consolidated around two to three slabs and the quantitative restrictions in intermediate and capital goods must be eliminated so firms can be compensated accurately for their tax burdens. The system that exists is far two complex. (3) The absolute level of tariffs on inputs must be reduced to administer the duty-free import schemes efficiently. High tariffs encourage leakage of duty-free imports into the domestic market and abuse of high drawback rates (incentives). (4) Tariffs and taxes on capital goods must be reduced to reduce the costs of investment. Tariffs in India - especially on key intermediate products (metals and chemicals) and capital goods - are high and getting higher fast. The high cost of basic inputs increases the cost of production, leads to uneconomic import-substitution which causes pressure for more protection, and requires an elaborate, cumbersome system to <b>compensate</b> exporters. High <b>tariffs</b> and excise taxes on capital goods damage Indian competitiveness, adding 10 to 15 percent {{to the cost of}} production and severely handicapping exporters. The excessive tariffs do not fulfill their primary purpose of providing protection and incentives; they are aimed at mainly generating revenues. Public revenues should be generated through more efficient instruments especially taxes.

40|$|Egyptian {{economic}} {{history has been}} influenced by the import-substitution industrialization approach to development, dating back to Gamal Abdel Nasser's Pan-Arabic and socialist movement in the 1950 s. Two major waves of liberalization have marked the government's efforts to rationalize and modernize the economy-the Infitah (opening) promoted by Anwar Sadat in the 1980 s, and further trade and privatization efforts by Hosni Mubarak in the 1990 s. Nonetheless, the extent of trade liberalization does not compare well with similar countries. Despite a decade of liberalization, the trade regime is characterized by deliberate and gradual reforms. By 1999 these reforms had led to average tariffs close to 30 percent, with high dispersion and escalation, well above those in comparable countries. provide a political economy analysis of the difficulties of liberalizing tariffs in Egypt in general, and in its specific industries.

If products are exported to Europe, the potential free access to the European market should more than <b>compensate</b> for any <b>tariff</b> reductions in the local market. On the other hand, if products are heavily imported from Europe, the preferential access for European exporters will tend to significantly increase their presence in the Egyptian market. This in turn will reduce the"protective"aspect of external tariffs in sectors with large import penetration as competition will be coming from Europe. The EU-Egypt agreement includes a lengthy (19 years) structure of tariff reduction. This structure will lead to increased effective rates of protection for the first eight years of its implementation, added economic distortions, and inefficient use of resources. The Egyptian authorities may want to consider speeding up the Euro-Med schedule of liberalization to mitigate an increase in effective rates of protection. Furthermore, special effort should be made to reduce external tariffs on semi-processed and processed goods to attenuate the expected negative effects of the rise in effective rates of protection. More generally, to prevent the high potential for trade diversion associated with Egypt's high tariffs, a simultaneous reduction in Egypt's external tariffs should accompany the EU-Egypt agreement.
