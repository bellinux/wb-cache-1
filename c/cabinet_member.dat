5|$|Cllr John Holdich OBE (Glinton and Wittering), <b>Cabinet</b> <b>Member</b> for Education, Skills and University {{and former}} mayor (1995-1996) was {{appointed}} Leader of the Council in 2015, replacing Cllr Marco Cereste OMRI (Stanground Central), {{who had served}} in the role since 2009 but lost his seat in 2015. The Deputy Leader is currently Cllr Wayne Fitzgerald (West), <b>Cabinet</b> <b>Member</b> for Integrated Adult Social Care and Health, replacing Holdich, who had served in that role since 2013.|$|E

5|$|By 1966, {{party leaders}} viewed Thatcher as a {{potential}} Shadow <b>Cabinet</b> <b>member.</b> Jim Prior suggested her as a member after the Conservatives' 1966 defeat, but party leader Edward Heath and Chief Whip William Whitelaw eventually settled on Mervyn Pike as the Shadow Cabinet's sole woman member.|$|E
50|$|Of the <b>cabinet</b> <b>members</b> {{excluding}} Ensour, four retained {{their previous}} {{posts in the}} first cabinet. Nine of the <b>cabinet</b> <b>members</b> are newcomers, while five served in other cabinets. There is only one woman in the cabinet, Reem Abu Hassan who was appointed minister of social development. None of the <b>cabinet</b> <b>members</b> are member of the parliament.|$|R
50|$|Telford and Wrekin {{operates}} a cabinet-style council. It has 54 elected councillors who appoint the seven <b>cabinet</b> <b>members,</b> including the leader, each year. The <b>cabinet</b> <b>members</b> make decisions {{as a whole}} and meet every two weeks.|$|R

5|$|Meester Hajjah Maria Ulfah Soebadio Sastrosatomo (18 August 1911– 15 April 1988), {{better known}} by her first married name Maria Ulfah Santoso, was an Indonesian women's rights activist and politician.

5|$|Bath and North East Somerset (B) Council has {{established}} the Bath City Forum, compising 12 nominated B councillors representing wards in Bath (and representing {{a cross-section of}} political parties), 1 <b>cabinet</b> <b>member</b> of B Council, and up to 13 co-opted members drawn from the communities of the city. The first meeting of the Forum was held on 13 October 2015, at the Guildhall, where the first Chair and Vice-Chair were elected.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{found that}} Fall and a {{relative}} {{had received a}} total of about $400,000 from Doheny and Sinclair, and that the transfers were contemporaneous with the controversial leases. Fall was ultimately convicted in 1929 for accepting bribes and, in 1931, became the first U.S. <b>cabinet</b> <b>member</b> to be imprisoned for crimes committed while in office. Sinclair was convicted only of contempt of court for jury tampering. Doheny was brought to trial before a jury in April 1930 for giving the bribe Fall had been convicted of accepting, but he was acquitted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cabinet</b> <b>members</b> {{are listed}} in bold face.|$|R
5000|$|All <b>Cabinet</b> <b>members</b> must {{be members}} of the Privy Council, since the cabinet is a {{committee}} of the council. Further, certain senior Loyal Opposition shadow <b>cabinet</b> <b>members</b> are also made Privy Counsellors, so that sensitive information may be shared with them [...] "on Privy Council terms".|$|R

5|$|Tătărescu {{resigned}} {{his office}} on 6 November 1947, {{and was replaced by}} the Communist Ana Pauker. For the following two months, he was sidelined in his own party by PCR pressures, and removed from its leadership in January 1948 (being replaced with Petre N. Bejan — the party was subsequently known as National Liberal Party-Petre N. Bejan). One of his last actions as <b>cabinet</b> <b>member</b> had been to sign the document officially rejecting the Marshall Plan.|$|E
5|$|Weizmann's {{political}} efforts {{picked up}} speed, and on 10December 1914 {{he met with}} Herbert Samuel, a British <b>Cabinet</b> <b>member</b> and a secular Jew who had studied Zionism; Samuel believed Weizmann's demands were too modest. Two days later, Weizmann met Balfour again, {{for the first time}} since their initial meeting in 1905; Balfour had been out of government ever since his electoral defeat in 1906, but remained a senior member of the Conservative Party in their role as Official Opposition.|$|E
5|$|During the 1850s, Inhaúma held {{a series}} of bureaucratic positions. He entered {{politics}} in 1861 {{as a member of the}} Conservative Party. He became a <b>cabinet</b> <b>member</b> and was given the position of navy minister. Inhaúma also became the first person to hold the Ministry of Agriculture portfolio, albeit briefly. The first professional firefighter corps in Brazil was formed during his tenure as agriculture minister. In late 1866, Inhaúma was appointed commander-in-chief of the fleet engaged in the Paraguayan War. During the fighting, he achieved the rank of admiral, the highest in the Brazilian armada. He was also awarded a noble title, eventually being raised from baron to viscount. In 1868, he was elected to the national legislature's lower house, but never assumed office.|$|E
50|$|As the <b>cabinet</b> <b>members</b> had feared, Tyler proved {{hostile to}} core Whig initiatives, vetoing {{a string of}} bills {{introduced}} by Clay and his allies in Congress. Finally, on September 11, 1841, two days after Tyler vetoed the Fiscal Corporation bill, Bell and several other <b>cabinet</b> <b>members</b> resigned in protest.|$|R
50|$|All <b>cabinet</b> <b>members</b> also {{sit in the}} National Assembly. This {{situation}} has been criticised by Namibia's civil society and the opposition as creating a significant overlap between executive and legislature, undermining the separation of powers. The seniority of <b>cabinet</b> <b>members</b> generally relegate ordinary MPs to the back benches.|$|R
50|$|Only {{three of}} the 27 <b>cabinet</b> <b>members</b> had {{previous}} experience in government, leading to speculation that it wouldn't last long. As it turned out, personality conflicts and the general inexperience of LPF <b>cabinet</b> <b>members</b> led to the rapid implosion of the cabinet after {{a little more than}} two months.|$|R
5|$|Former North Carolina Senator Elizabeth Dole is {{the first}} woman to have served in two {{different}} Cabinet positions in two different administrations. She was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as Secretary of Transportation in 1983, and was the Secretary of Labor during the tenure of George H. W. Bush—Reagan's successor. Czechoslovakia-born Madeleine Albright became the first foreign-born woman to serve in the Cabinet when she was appointed Secretary of State in 1997. Her appointment also made her the highest-ranking female <b>Cabinet</b> <b>member</b> at that time. Condoleezza Rice was appointed Secretary of State in 2005, and thus became the highest-ranking woman in the United States presidential line of succession in history. In 2006, Nancy Pelosi replaced Rice as the highest-ranking woman in line when she was elected Speaker of the House.|$|E
5|$|He {{then joined}} the cabinet during a 2004 reshuffle, {{serving as the}} Norwegian Minister of the Environment from summer 2004 to fall 2005. He was the {{youngest}} ever <b>cabinet</b> <b>member</b> from the Christian Democratic Party, and the first Christian Democratic to hold the post. The second cabinet Bondevik did not survive the 2005 elections, and as such Hareide had to step down from office that year. His successor was Helen Bjørnøy. Until 2009, Hareide had never been elected to the Norwegian Parliament, but served as a deputy representative during the terms 19972001, 20012005 and 20052009. On the local level of politics {{he was a member}} of Bømlo municipality council from 1991 to 1995.|$|E
5|$|If a {{representative}} is absent for whatever reason, {{his or her}} seat will be filled by a candidate from the same party-list—in other words, there are no by-elections. Representatives who die during the term are replaced permanently, whereas representatives who are appointed to a government position, such as government minister (<b>cabinet</b> <b>member)</b> or state secretary, {{will be replaced by}} a deputy representative until the representative no longer holds the government position. Deputy representatives also meet during typically short-term absence, like when {{a representative}} travels abroad with a parliamentary work group or is absent for health reasons.|$|E
50|$|Since none of {{the members}} of the Keep Commission were even Presidential <b>Cabinet</b> <b>Members,</b> it seems that some of the <b>Cabinet</b> <b>members</b> were quite embarrassed by the results but others such as the Department of the Interior and the Department of Commerce took the {{recommendations}} of the Commission seriously and even encouraged more investigation. The President's direct involvement and support of the Commission seems to have kept dissension to the report to a minimum from the cabinet. However, since the Commission was not sanctioned by Congress, the <b>Cabinet</b> <b>members</b> were free to ignore some recommendations.|$|R
5|$|The Department of Treasury has had {{the most}} {{foreign-born}} Secretaries, with five. Department of Labor and Interior follow with three, and the departments of Housing and Urban Development and State have each had two. Former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and Madeleine Albright were the highest-ranking foreign-born <b>Cabinet</b> <b>members</b> ever in accordance to the United States presidential line of succession. The majority of foreign-born <b>Cabinet</b> <b>members</b> were born in Europe. Most European-born <b>Cabinet</b> <b>members</b> originated from the United Kingdom and Germany with five and four respectively, {{and the others were}} born in Ireland, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland and Italy. Four <b>Cabinet</b> <b>members</b> were born in the Americas, and one was born in Asia. The departments of Defense, Justice, Health and Human Services, Energy, Education, Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security have not had foreign-born Secretaries.|$|R

5|$|Macdonald also {{wished to}} secure the Colony of British Columbia. There was {{interest}} in the United States in bringing about the colony's annexation, and Macdonald wished to ensure his new nation had a Pacific outlet. The colony had an extremely large debt {{that would have to}} be assumed should it join Confederation. Negotiations were conducted in 1870, principally during Macdonald's illness and recuperation, with Cartier leading the Canadian delegation. Cartier offered British Columbia a railroad linking it to the eastern provinces within 10 years. The British Columbians, who privately had been prepared to accept far less generous terms, quickly agreed and joined Confederation in 1871. The Canadian Parliament ratified the terms after a debate over the high cost that <b>cabinet</b> <b>member</b> Alexander Morris described as the worst fight the Conservatives had had since Confederation.|$|E
5|$|Robert C. Weaver {{became the}} first African American to hold a Cabinet-level {{position}} when he was appointed Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Patricia Roberts Harris {{became the first}} African-American female <b>cabinet</b> <b>member</b> when she was appointed Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in 1977. In 1979, Harris became the first African American to be head of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, which was split into the departments of Education and Health and Human Services in the same year. The appointments of Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of State made them the highest-ranking African Americans in the United States presidential line of succession.|$|E

5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} Indonesia in 1942, Santoso {{left her}} work as a teacher and found employment as legal assistant to Soepomo, who later became the country's first minister of justice. In 1945, with the Japanese preparing to withdraw from the Indies and the proclamation of independence looming, Santoso {{became a member of the}} Committee for Preparatory Work for Indonesian Independence. On 12 March 1946, Santoso became the first ever female <b>cabinet</b> <b>member</b> when she was selected as services minister in the Second Sjahrir Cabinet. Working quickly and efficiently, she found herself organising the return of internees from Japanese-run camps. She was kept on through the Third Sjahrir Cabinet, but when it dissolved on 26 June 1947, Santoso refused another term as social minister. She instead chose to work as head of prime minister Amir Sjarifuddin's secretariat. She kept this position into the First Hatta Cabinet. During Operation Kraai, a Dutch-led offensive on the city of Yogyakarta on 19 December 1948, her husband was killed outside Maguwo.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{became the}} leading <b>cabinet</b> <b>member</b> {{in the new}} {{government}} under President Washington. He was a nationalist who emphasized strong central government and successfully argued that the implied powers of the Constitution provided the legal authority to fund the national debt, assume states' debts, and create the government-backed Bank of the United States. These programs were funded primarily by a tariff on imports, and later also by a highly controversial tax on whiskey. To overcome localism, Hamilton mobilized a nationwide network of friends of the government, especially bankers and businessmen, which became the Federalist Party. A major issue {{in the emergence of}} the American two-party system was the Jay Treaty, largely designed by Hamilton in 1794. It established friendly trade relations with Britain, to the chagrin of France and the supporters of the French Revolution. Hamilton {{played a central role in}} the Federalist party, which dominated national and state politics until it lost the election of 1800 to Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, the United States Embassy in London chose Thatcher to {{take part}} in the International Visitor Leadership Program (then called the Foreign Leader Program), a {{professional}} exchange programme that gave her the opportunity to spend about six weeks visiting various US cities and political figures as well as institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. Although she was not yet a Cabinet or Shadow <b>Cabinet</b> <b>member,</b> the embassy reportedly described her to the State Department as a possible future Prime Minister. The description helped Thatcher meet with many prominent people during a busy itinerary focused on economic issues, including Paul Samuelson, Walt Rostow, Pierre-Paul Schweitzer and Nelson Rockefeller. In 1967, Heath appointed Thatcher to the Shadow Cabinet as Fuel and Power spokesman. Prior to the 1970 general election, she was promoted to Shadow Transport spokesman and later to Education.|$|E
