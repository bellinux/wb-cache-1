5|$|A Markov <b>chain</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} Markov {{process that}} has either {{discrete}} state space or discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies.

If such a <b>chain</b> <b>is</b> found, the instance cannot be satisfiable.

5|$|A recent {{modification}} of the Nice model has the Solar System begin with five giant planets, including an additional ice giant, in a chain of mean-motion resonances. About 400 million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System the resonance <b>chain</b> <b>is</b> broken. Instead of being scattered into the disc, the ice giants first migrate outward several AU. This divergent migration eventually leads to a resonance crossing, destabilizing the orbits of the planets. The extra ice giant encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and after a series of encounters is ejected from the Solar System. The remaining planets then continue their migration until the planetesimal disc is nearly depleted with small fractions remaining in various locations.|$|E

The IgD-like membrane H <b>chain</b> <b>was</b> denser than membrane IgM H chain, and its carbohydrate content was calculated to be 15. 5 %. The resolution of the technique was sufficient {{to conclude that the}} apparent 1500 mol. wt. difference, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, between membrane and secreted IgM H <b>chains</b> <b>was</b> due to peptide rather than to carbohydrate.

5|$|At higher {{temperatures}} tellurium {{is sufficiently}} plastic to extrude. It melts at 449.51°C. Crystalline tellurium has a structure consisting of parallel infinite spiral chains. The bonding between adjacent atoms in a <b>chain</b> <b>is</b> covalent, {{but there is}} evidence of a weak metallic interaction between the neighbouring atoms of different chains. Tellurium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 1.0S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.32 to 0.38eV. Liquid tellurium is a semiconductor, with an electrical conductivity, on melting, of around 1.9 × 103S•cm−1. Superheated liquid tellurium is a metallic conductor.|$|E
5|$|At pH values {{between the}} two pKa values, the {{zwitterion}} predominates, but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint {{between the two}} pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero. This pH {{is known as the}} isoelectric point pI, so pI = ½(pKa1 + pKa2). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the side <b>chain</b> <b>is</b> involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative side chains, pI = ½(pKa1 + pKaR), where pKaR is the side chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pKaR = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side <b>chain</b> <b>is</b> not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side chains, pI = ½(pKaR + pKa2). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.|$|E
5|$|Causes of {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} include an ear canal blocked by ear wax, ossicles that are fixed together or absent, or holes in the eardrum. Conductive hearing loss may also result from middle ear inflammation causing fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space, such as by otitis media. Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ear's eardrum and ossicles. Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum. Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular <b>chain</b> <b>is</b> rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.|$|E
40|$|J <b>chain</b> {{expression}} <b>was</b> examined as {{a function}} of the stage in differentiation along the B cell axis in humans. Intracellular distribution of J and mu chains in leukemic HLA-DR+ null and pre-B cells, and in normal B cells stimulated with pokeweed mitogen (PWM) was determined by immunoelectron microscopy and radioimmunoassay (RIA). J <b>chain</b> <b>was</b> detected in leukemic null and pre-B cells on free and membrane-bound ribosomes in the cytoplasm, or on perinuclear cisternae. Mu <b>chain</b> <b>was</b> found on free ribosomes and ribosomal clusters in leukemic pre-B cells but was absent in the leukemic null cells. In pre-B cell lines, mu <b>chain</b> <b>was</b> seen within rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and the Golgi apparatus whereas J <b>chain</b> <b>was</b> not detected in these organelles. However, both mu and J <b>chain</b> <b>were</b> detected in RER and the Golgi apparatus of immature and mature plasma cells induced by PWM stimulation of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. Low levels of J <b>chain</b> <b>were</b> also detected by RIA in lysates of leukemic null and pre-B cells. Most of the intracellular J chain became detectable after reduction and alkylation of cell lysates, and free J <b>chain</b> <b>was</b> not found in the culture supernatants. The amount of intracellular and secreted immunoglobulin-bound J chain increased dramatically after PWM stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes. The majority of J chain- positive cells seen over an 8 d culture interval were lymphocytes and lymphoblasts, while mu <b>chain</b> <b>was</b> found primarily in plasma cells. These results suggest that J chain expression precedes mu chain synthesis during B cell differentiation and that a combination of the two <b>chains</b> for secretion <b>is</b> not initiated until the onset of plasma cells maturation...|$|R

5|$|Each {{heavy chain}} has two regions, the {{constant}} {{region and the}} variable region. The constant region is identical in all antibodies of the same isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a constant region composed of three tandem (in a line) Ig domains, and a hinge region for added flexibility; heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of four immunoglobulin domains. The variable region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, but {{is the same for}} all antibodies produced by a single B cell or B cell clone. The variable region of each heavy <b>chain</b> <b>is</b> approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain.|$|E

Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical; only one type of light chain, κ or λ, is present per antibody in mammals. Other types of light chains, such as the iota (ι) chain, are found in other vertebrates like sharks (Chondrichthyes) and bony fishes (Teleostei).|$|E
