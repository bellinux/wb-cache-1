25|$|The {{legitimacy}} of the subcell structure came from the recruitment process, originally by the case officer {{and then by the}} cell leaders. Sometimes, the cell leader would propose subcell member names to the case officer, so the case officer could have a headquarters name check run before bringing the individual into the subcell. In principle, however, the subcell members would know ALPINE, and sometimes {{the other members of the}} ALPINE cell if they needed to work together; if ALPINE-1 and ALPINE-2 had independent assignments, they might not know each other. ALPINE-1 and ALPINE-2 <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> know ALASTAIR or anyone in the ALTITUDE or ALLOVER cells.|$|E

According to Jeff Kitts of Guitar World, he [...] "influenced a generation and changed the course of metal forever". Alex Webster of Cannibal Corpse, who considers Hanneman his major influence as a composer, regarded him as [...] "one of the greatest musicians and songwriters in metal" [...] and Alexi Laiho of Children of Bodom described him as [...] "one of the fathers of metal".|$|E

500|$|Reviewing Harrison's musical {{career in}} a 2002 issue of Goldmine magazine, Dave Thompson wrote that [...] "Love You To" [...] "opened {{creative}} doors through which Harrison's bandmates may not – and [...] Martin <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> – have {{ever dreamed of}} passing". Rolling Stone contributor Greg Kot pairs it with [...] "Taxman" [...] as two [...] "major contributions" [...] that saw Harrison [...] " [...] into his own as a songwriter" [...] on Revolver. Kot describes [...] "Love You To" [...] as [...] "a boldly experimental track" [...] and [...] "the first full-scale incorporation of Eastern instruments on a Beatles album". Writing on his music website Elsewhere, Graham Reid views the song as a [...] "classic" [...] due to its standing as [...] "arguably the first in Western pop … which owes nothing to pop music traditions. It is an Indian song in its structure and execution." ...|$|E
500|$|Lody {{stated that}} he had been sent to the UK [...] "to remain until the first [...] {{encounter}} had taken place between the two Powers, and to send accurate information as regards the actual losses of the British Fleet", as well as to observe what he could of Fleet movements off the coast. The court martial went into an in camera session while sensitive evidence was being heard. Lody claimed that he had asked in August to be erased from military service on the grounds of poor health and to be allowed to travel to the United States. This was refused, he went on, but a member of naval intelligence whom he had previously never met coaxed him into undertaking a mission in the UK on the condition that he could go to the US afterwards. Lody told the tribunal that he was not pressured but that [...] "I have never been a coward in my life and I <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be a shirker", and that he had persisted with his mission because [...] "once a man has promised to do a thing he does it, that is the understanding." [...] His services were provided [...] "absolutely as an honour and free", while he had never intended to be a spy: [...] "I was pressed for secret service, but not as a spy– oh, no. If that would have been mentioned to me at Berlin I surely would have refused. The word in the sentence, I do not think it goes together." [...] He claimed that he had [...] "pledged my word of honour" [...] not to name his controller.|$|E

2500|$|Sheshet, who, {{as stated}} above, was blind, once mingled with a crowd {{waiting to see}} the entry of the king. A heretic, {{probably}} an adherent of Manicheism, against which Sheshet polemized (comp. Bacher Ag. Bab. Amor. p.78, note 12), taunted him with the remark that he <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{be able to see}} the king. Sheshet, however, put the heretic to shame by recognizing, despite his blindness, when the instant of the king's appearance was at hand. When the unbeliever, in his astonishment, asked Sheshet how he knew it, he received the answer: [...] "The earthly kingdom is like unto the heavenly; God's appearance, however, is announced in I Kings xix. 12-13 by a deep silence" [...] (Ber. 58a).|$|E

2500|$|On {{choosing}} {{a career in}} chess, Duchamp said, [...] "If Bobby Fischer came to me for advice, I <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> discourage him—as if anyone could—but I would {{try to make it}} positively clear that he will never have any money from chess, live a monk-like existence and know more rejection than any artist ever has, struggling to be known and accepted." [...] Duchamp left a legacy to chess {{in the form of an}} enigmatic endgame problem he composed in 1943. The problem was included in the announcement for Julian Levi's gallery exhibition Through the Big End of the Opera Glass, printed on translucent paper with the faint inscription: [...] "White to play and win". Grandmasters and endgame specialists have since grappled with the problem, with most concluding that there is no solution.|$|E
2500|$|Though this {{particular}} painting {{is one of}} the most straightforward in the series, there is still some minor dispute about its significance. Rather than accept this as a depiction of Marie as Justice, some hold that the real subject of the painting is the [...] "return to earth of Astraea, the principle of divine justice, in a golden age." [...] They support this claim with a statement in Rubens's notes which indicates that [...] "this theme holds no special reference to the particular reason of state of the French kingdom." [...] Certain symbolic elements, such as the wreath of oak leaves (a possible corona civica), France being seen as a subjugated province, and the inclusion of Saturn in the scheme might all point to this interpretation and <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have been lost on Rubens. Fortunately, and perhaps solely due to the controversy surrounding this painting, Rubens mentioned its significance in a letter to Peiresc dated 13 May 1625. [...] It reads, ...|$|E
2500|$|Kant thinks that, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the good will, all goods are qualified. By qualified, Kant means that those goods are good insofar as they presuppose or derive their goodness from something else. Take wealth as an example. Wealth can be extremely good if it is used for human welfare, but it can be disastrous if a corrupt mind is behind it. In a similar vein, we often desire intelligence and take it to be good, but we <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> take the intelligence of an evil genius to be good. The good will, by contrast, is good in itself. [...] Kant writes, “A good will is not good because of what it effects or accomplishes, because of its fitness to attain some proposed end, but only because its volition, that is, it is good initself [...] [...] [...] [...]” (4:394) The precise nature of the good will is subject to scholarly debate.|$|E

2500|$|The {{authenticity}} of the documents was challenged within hours on Internet forums and blogs, with questions initially focused on alleged anachronisms in the documents' typography. [...] Content soon spread to the mass media. Although CBS and Rather defended the authenticity and usage of the documents for a two-week period, continued scrutiny from other news organizations and independent analysis of the documents obtained by USA Today and CBS raised questions about their validity {{and led to a}} public repudiation on September 20, 2004. Rather stated, [...] "if I knew then what I know now – I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have used the documents in question," [...] and CBS News President Andrew Heyward said, [...] "Based on what we now know, CBS News cannot prove that the documents are authentic, which is the only acceptable journalistic standard to justify using them in the report.

2500|$|In 1909, Murphy {{published}} a column deploring the ongoing agitation against college football. He responded to charges {{that it was}} a brutal sport as follows: [...] "I am not disposed to deny that football is a rough game. But when cleanly played as it is in our big colleges, and when properly safeguarded the element of danger is almost entirely eliminated." [...] In response to proposals to replace football in American universities with either soccer or Canadian rugby, Murphy expressed disdain: [...] "Both of these are jokes when compared to the American game. They lack the science of our football and <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> prove very interesting to the spectators." [...] Murphy spoke in favor of removing restrictions on the forward pass, which he viewed as a spectacular play and one that weakens the defense. His main suggestions for eliminating injuries were to abolish the diving tackle, develop better padding, and eliminate the kickoff. With respect to the kickoff, Murphy noted: [...] "I have always felt that it was in the crash of the two teams that most accidents occurred." ...|$|E
2500|$|The church's nave {{would have}} been used for parish worship, regular preaching, {{university}} debates and lectures. Until the completion of a chapel for neighbouring Gonville Hall in 1396, both Michaelhouse and Gonville shared {{in the use of the}} two aisles; Gonville making use of the north aisle of the church, Michaelhouse using the south. Since Gonville Hall was dedicated to the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the north aisle altar was also dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. The south aisle altar was known as that of [...] "St Gregory of Pity", indicating that it {{would have been}} surmounted by an image of the Pity, that is, Christ and the instruments of the Passion. Its association with St Gregory derives from a vision by Pope Gregory the Great when celebrating mass of Christ's real presence and sacrifice in the eucharistic bread. One of the later Hostels of Michaelhouse shared the dedication of the College chapel. While the altarpiece may have survived the reformation, it <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have survived local Cromwellian iconoclasm, and was most likely destroyed, alongside other images in St Michael's, on Boxing Day 1643. However, a late-medieval scutum sancti Trinitatis (Shield of the Trinity), in the middle ages widely believed to be the Shield of St Michael and probably used as the College's coat of arms, has survived in the chapel's stained glass window.|$|E
