5|$|From January to April 1916, Kippenberger {{underwent}} {{basic training}} at Trentham Military <b>Camp</b> <b>as</b> {{part of the}} 12th Reinforcement of the NZEF. On 1 May, he embarked for Europe to join the New Zealand Division. However, during transit his transport ship was unexpectedly diverted to Egypt. For two months, his contingent was based at the training camp of the Australian Imperial Force at Tel-el-Kebir but had {{very little to do}} with only a few hours of training each day. The 12th Reinforcement left in July for Sling Camp in England, where it underwent more intense training.|$|E

5|$|Heading {{into his}} rookie {{training}} camp, Sanchez {{was listed as}} the second quarterback behind veteran Kellen Clemens.

5|$|Shein's army {{retreated to}} its main camp, {{which was in}} turn {{surrounded}} by Commonwealth forces in mid-October. The besieged Russians waited for relief, but none arrived, as Commonwealth and Cossack cavalry {{had been sent to}} disrupt the Russian rear. Some historians also cite dissent and internal divisions in the Russian <b>camp</b> <b>as</b> responsible for their inaction and ineffectiveness (Jasienica blames the Russian warlords, and Parker the foreign mercenaries). The Tatar invasion threatening the south Russian borderlands was a contributory factor, with many soldiers and boyars from those regions deserting the Russian camp to return to protect their homes. Some foreign mercenaries also deserted to the Commonwealth side.|$|E
5|$|Sobieski was {{a member}} of the Polish defense crew besieged by Cossacks at Zbaraż from 10 July to 22 August 1649. In 1650 he fought against the Cossacks at Kamieniec Podolski. Marek Sobieski also took part in the Battle of Beresteczko on 28–30 June 1651. After the Polish victory, due his bravery, he {{received}} a saber of Tugay Bey, who had been killed during the battle. In September 1651 he fought at the Battle of Biała Cerkiew. When the Poles, Cossacks and Tatars began negotiations, Marek Sobieski was sent to the Cossack <b>camp</b> <b>as</b> a guarantor of safety for the Cossack leader, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, who was in the Polish camp.|$|E
5|$|The Romans {{spent the}} next two days {{scouting}} the surrounding area and on the third day they met the Galatian army consisting of 50,000 men.

The flanks stood their grounds for longer but were eventually forced to retreat. The Romans chased them, plundered the Galatian <b>camp</b> <b>as</b> the surviving Galatians fled across the river to join the women, children and the Trocmi.|$|E

He was reassigned to the Moose on October 3, 2005, and missed the first {{month and a half}} of the 2005–06 season. While sidelined, Bieksa was named an alternate captain to Mike Keane by Moose Head Coach Alain Vigneault on October 29. He made his return to the line-up on November 11 against the Rochester Americans. In his second game back, he notched two goals and an assist on November 15 against the Grand Rapids Griffins in a 6–5 shootout loss.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, Lamason {{was among}} a group of 168 allied airmen from Great Britain, United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Jamaica who -- along with over 2,500 French prisoners -- were taken by train—in overcrowded cattle boxcars — from Fresnes Prison outside Paris, to Buchenwald {{concentration}} <b>camp.</b> <b>As</b> the airmen were herded into the boxcars, Lamason protested about the poor treatment of the airmen, only to be struck in the face by a SS guard. Lamason fell to the ground and captured pilot Roy Allen watched as a SS Major pulled a Luger from his holster and thought Lamason would be shot on the spot. After five days travel, during which the airmen received very little food or water, they arrived at Buchenwald on 20 August 1944.|$|E
5|$|Due to Nelsen's injury, Gault {{was given}} the start in next week's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, facing off against fellow rookie and first overall draft pick, Terry Bradshaw. In his only career start, he {{completed}} one pass for 44 yards in 16 attempts, threw two interceptions, and finished {{the game with a}} 0.0 passer rating. He also led the Browns to only three first downs during the first half, and as a result Phipps took over at quarterback; the Browns {{went on to win the}} game, 15-7. Nelsen recovered from the injury the following week and turn back over for the Browns at quarterback; Gault did not play another snap that season. Entering the 1971 season, Gault modified his throwing style after discussion with new head coach Nick Skorich, and was throwing better in training <b>camp</b> <b>as</b> a result. After training camp ended, however, he was placed on the practice squad, where he remained throughout the season.|$|E

5|$|Following restructuring, {{the army}} in Scotland {{became part of the}} 2nd Division, whose {{headquarters}} moved to Craigiehall Camp from York. Craigiehall itself was formerly the HQ of the Black Watch regiment, and now serves as the Officers' Mess for the <b>camp.</b> <b>As</b> of 2007, around 250 people, including civilian and military personnel, are employed at Craigiehall. In March 2007, the Ministry of Defence announced plans for a new headquarters building at Craigiehall. Under the plans, the existing Annandale Block would be demolished, and the walled garden in which it stands would be restored. The new building was to be constructed elsewhere on the grounds, and was granted planning permission in September 2007. On 14 December 2007, defence ministers from eight NATO countries met at Craigiehall to discuss the role of NATO troops involved in Afghanistan. Among the ministers attending were Des Browne from the UK, Robert Gates from the US, and Joel Fitzgibbon from Australia. A protest march was organised, attracting around 30 demonstrators.|$|E
5|$|In March 1524 Pedro de Alvarado camped outside Q'umarkaj. He {{invited the}} K'iche' lords Oxib-Keh (the ajpop, or king) and Beleheb-Tzy (the ajpop k'amha, or king elect) {{to visit him}} in his <b>camp.</b> <b>As</b> soon as they did so, he seized them as prisoners. In {{response}} to a furious K'iche' counterattack, Alvarado had the captured K'iche' lords burnt to death, and then proceeded to burn the entire city. After the destruction of Q'umarkaj, Pedro de Alvarado sent messages to Iximche, capital of the Kaqchikel, proposing an alliance against the remaining K'iche' resistance. Alvarado wrote that they sent 4000 warriors to assist him, although the Kaqchikel recorded that they sent only 400. With the capitulation of the K'iche' kingdom, various non-K'iche' peoples under K'iche' dominion also submitted to the Spanish. This included the Mam inhabitants of the area now within the modern department of San Marcos.|$|E
5|$|News of {{the rescue}} was {{released}} to the public on February 2. The feat was celebrated by MacArthur's soldiers, Allied correspondents, and the American public, as the raid had touched an emotional chord among Americans concerned about the fate of the defenders of Bataan and Corregidor. Family members of the POWs were contacted by telegram to inform them {{of the rescue}}. News of the raid was broadcast on numerous radio outlets and newspaper front pages. The Rangers and POWs were interviewed to describe the conditions of the <b>camp,</b> <b>as</b> well as the events of the raid. The enthusiasm over the raid was later overshadowed by other Pacific events, including the Battle for Iwo Jima and the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The raid was soon followed by additional successful raids, such as the raid of Santo Tomas Civilian Internment Camp on February3, the raid of Bilibid Prison on February4, and the raid at Los Baños on February23.|$|E

5|$|On 4 May a {{group of}} around forty men carried out the Acre Prison break, {{releasing}} forty-one Jews and 214 Arabs. At {{the same time a}} mortar attack was carried out on the 2nd Parachute Battalion's <b>camp,</b> <b>as</b> a diversion. The first unit to reach the prison was a platoon from the 1st Parachute Battalion, 35 minutes later. Other men from the battalion and some divisional units were bathing in the sea a short distance from the prison. A truck load of escaping prisoners opened fire on one unit's armoured car. The escaping truck then reached an improvised road block set up by some bathers and crashed under fire. The division's bathing party killed four attackers, four Jewish and one Arab escapee, and recaptured thirteen Jews. The bathers had eight men wounded during the short battle. While this was going on, the 1st Parachute Brigade was establishing a cordon around Acre and the surrounding area but no further escapees were caught.|$|E
5|$|The Teaneck Community Charter School (TCCS) had a 2011–12 {{enrollment}} of 306 students in Kindergarten through eighth grade with 26.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.77:1. TCCS is {{a charter school}} that operates independently of the Teaneck Public Schools under a charter granted by the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Education, which was renewed for five years in 2012. Admission {{is open to the}} public for available slots (after returning students and siblings of existing students are entered) and offers an after school program and summer <b>camp.</b> <b>As</b> the school is a public school, no tuition is charged. Funding comes from the Teaneck Public Schools (and the home districts of non-resident students), which provides 90% of its cost per pupil in the district; the balance of funding comes directly from the state of New Jersey. The school moved to a new building at 563 Chestnut Avenue in the 2009–10 school year, from a space it had rented on Palisade Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The dispute did not delay work. Although {{progress}} on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict {{the scope of the}} project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the construction <b>camp.</b> <b>As</b> area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site. At its peak, the construction camp was the third most populous town in Washington state. Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago. Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a gated community with restricted access, but it looked more like a typical wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and physical security elements like high fences, towers, and guard dogs were less evident.|$|E
