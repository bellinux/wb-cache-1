40|$|Introduction. <b>Clotiapine</b> is an {{atypical}} antipsychotic of the dibenzothiazepine class {{introduced in}} a few European countries since 1970, efficient in treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients. There is little published data on the therapeutic and toxic concentrations of this drug. Aims. The aim {{of the present study}} is the development and validation of a method that allows the detection and quantification of <b>clotiapine</b> in blood and urine specimens by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Methods. Validation was performed working on spiked postmortem blood and urine samples. Samples were extracted with liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) technique at pH 8. 5 with n-hexane/dichloromethane (85 / 15 v/v) and analysis was followed by GC-MS. Methadone-d 9 was used as internal standard. Results. The limit of detection (LOD) was 1. 2 and 1. 3 [*]ng/mL for urine and blood, respectively, while the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 3. 9 and 4. 3 [*]ng/mL, respectively. Linearity, precision, selectivity, accuracy, and recovery were also determined. The method was applied to a postmortem case. The blood and urine <b>clotiapine</b> concentrations were 1. 32 and 0. 49 [*]μg/mL, respectively. Conclusions.

40|$|The {{case here}} {{reported}} involves a schizophrenic 19 -year-old girl under treatment with <b>clotiapine,</b> which was well tolerated {{except for a}} moderate dry mouth. The woman ingested a whole sole (Solea solea), which caused a very rapid death by choking. A complete autopsy was performed 24 h later, as well as histological and toxicological analysis. At autopsy, the sole was wedged in the esophagus causing a choking ab extrinseco. The fish had a length of 18 cm and a maximum width of 6 cm, weighing 188. 7 g. Toxicological analysis detected 0. 57 mg/L of <b>clotiapine</b> in blood, which falls within the therapeutic range. The peculiarity of this case is represented by two factors: one is the choking by fish and the second was the adverse affect caused by <b>clotiapine,</b> which induced a condition of dry mouth making the act of swallowing even more difficult, thereby contributing to a very rapid mechanical asphyxia {{and the death of}} the young woman...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} drugs are largely metabolized after oral administration, {{especially}} by redox processes. Among the neuroleptics, loxapine, <b>clotiapine</b> and clozapine, which are seven-membered tricyclic molecules with a piperazine side-chain, {{are known to}} be extensively metabolized by oxidation. An electrochemical study of these compounds was initiated in order to determine their in vitro redox properties and to elucidate their oxidation mechanisms. The measurements were carried out in aqueous and non-aqueous media using voltammetric, cyclic voltammetric, coulometric, exhaustive electrolysis and thin-layer spectroelectrochemical techniques. The oxidation mechanisms, which differ essentially depending on the pH of the solution, are suggested. In view of these results, various similarities have been detected between the in vitro oxidation processes and the pharmacological behaviour reported in the literature. For example, the importance of the piperazine side-chain has been pointed out: oxidation no longer occurs if this side-chain is protonated; similarly, binding to the receptor is prevented if the lone electron pair of the tertiary atom is occupied. Nucleophilic additions have also been observed in non-aqueous media and the compounds have been identified using classical spectroscopic techniques. If the oxidation mechanism is identical on the piperazine chain for the three compounds, the process is somewhat different when it occurs on the tricyclic ring. Loxapine and <b>clotiapine</b> exhibit different behaviour from clozapine, in their electrochemical as well as in their pharmacological properties. SCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

In the first study, which included 84 randomized outpatients, TBZ showed a significant improvement of chorea compared with placebo. In the open-label study extension, TBZ confirmed its efficacy on chorea, with a frequent occurrence of withdrawals due to side effects. In a retrospective study of long-term efficacy, 63 patients under TBZ therapy for an average period of 34 months showed a stable effect on chorea, despite a slight reduction of effect over time.

40|$|Objective: The neuroleptic-induced {{catatonia}} is {{an unusual}} side effect traditionally associated with high potency neuroleptics. Method: We describe the case of 36 -year-old woman suffering from disorganized schizophrenia, without previous history of catatonia, who developed a catatonic reaction secondary {{to the use of}} clozapine. Results: After having been treated with different classes of neuroleptics (i. e. haloperidol, risperidone, <b>clotiapine,</b> olanzapine) with alternate clinical responses, a trial of clozapine was started. Over the next two weeks, the patient’s mental conditions gradually improved but marked catatonic symptoms emerged, {{in the absence of any}} symptoms of NMS. In the hypothesis of a NIC secondary to clozapine, all medications were discontinued and lorazepam was started. Catatonic symptoms gradually improved and five days after clozapine discontinuation all symptoms disappeared. Conclusions: This case report supports that hypothesis that atypical neuroleptics, with weak dopamine-blocking properties, such as clozapine, could also be involved in causing NIC...|$|E

We analyzed antipsychotic prescriptions in 4345 patients attended in five Psychiatric Community Mental Health Centers from June 2014 to October 2014. The web-application reported average daily dose prescribed for antipsychotics, prescribed daily dose (PDD), and the PDD to defined daily dose (DDD) ratio. The MEmind web-application reported that antipsychotics were used in 1116 patients out of the total sample, mostly in 486 (44 %) patients with schizophrenia related disorders but also in other diagnoses. Second generation antipsychotics (quetiapine, aripiprazole and long-acting paliperidone) were preferably employed. Low doses were more frequently used than high doses.

40|$|Great strides {{have been}} made in the last few years in the {{pharmacological}} treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, with the introduction into the therapy of several new and more efficient agents, which have improved the quality of life of many patients. Despite these advances, a large percentage of patients is still considered “non-responder” to the therapy, not drawing any benefits from it. Moreover, these patients have a peculiar therapeutic profile, due to the very frequent application of polypharmacy, attempting to obtain satisfactory remission of the multiple aspects of psychiatric syndromes. Therapy is heavily individualised and switching from one therapeutic agent to another is quite frequent. One of the main problems of this situation is the possibility of unwanted or unexpected pharmacological interactions, which can occur both during polypharmacy and during switching. Simultaneous administration of psychiatric drugs can easily lead to interactions if one of the administered compounds influences the metabolism of the others. Impaired CYP 450 function due to inhibition of the enzyme is frequent. Other metabolic pathways, such as glucuronidation, can also be influenced. The Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) of psychotropic drugs is an important tool for treatment personalisation and optimisation. It deals with the determination of parent drugs and metabolites plasma levels, in order to monitor them over time and to compare these findings with clinical data. This allows establishing chemical-clinical correlations (such as those between administered dose and therapeutic and side effects), which are essential to obtain the maximum therapeutic efficacy, while minimising side and toxic effects. It is evident the importance of developing sensitive and selective analytical methods for the determination of the administered drugs and their main metabolites, in order to obtain reliable data that can correctly support clinical decisions. During the three years of Ph. D. program, some analytical methods based on HPLC have been developed, validated and successfully applied to the TDM of psychiatric patients undergoing treatment with drugs belonging to following classes: antipsychotics, antidepressants and anxiolytic-hypnotics. The biological matrices which have been processed were: blood, plasma, serum, saliva, urine, hair and rat brain. Among antipsychotics, both atypical and classical agents have been considered, such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, <b>clotiapine,</b> loxapine, risperidone (and 9 -hydroxyrisperidone), clozapine (as well as N-desmethylclozapine and clozapine N-oxide) and quetiapine. While the need for an accurate TDM of schizophrenic patients is being increasingly recognized by psychiatrists, only in the last few years the same attention is being paid to the TDM of depressed patients. This is leading to the acknowledgment that depression pharmacotherapy can greatly benefit from the accurate application of TDM. For this reason, the research activity has also been focused on first and second-generation antidepressant agents, like triciclic antidepressants, trazodone and m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-cpp), paroxetine and its three main metabolites, venlafaxine and its active metabolite, and the most recent antidepressant introduced into the market, duloxetine. Among anxiolytics-hypnotics, benzodiazepines are very often involved in the pharmacotherapy of depression for the relief of anxious components; for this reason, it is useful to monitor these drugs, especially in cases of polypharmacy. The results obtained during these three years of Ph. D. program are reliable and the developed HPLC methods are suitable for the qualitative and quantitative determination of CNS drugs in biological fluids for TDM purposes...|$|E
