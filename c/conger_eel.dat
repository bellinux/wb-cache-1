5|$|Bouillabaisse is a {{substantial}} dish from the French port of Marseille, capital of Provence. It is a stew for at least eight people, because it should contain many kinds of fish such as crayfish, gurnard, weever, John Dory, monkfish, <b>conger</b> <b>eel,</b> whiting, sea bass, and crab. These are cooked with Mediterranean vegetables and herbs, namely onions, garlic, tomatoes, thyme, fennel, parsley, bay, and orange peel.|$|E
25|$|Much {{maritime}} activity {{takes place}} - especially at Kilmore Quay and Slade, {{but also on}} a smaller scale at many other locations. Common fish species include herring, mackerel, cod, monkfish, whiting, bass, perch, gurnard, haddock, mullet, pollock, John Dory, sole, <b>conger</b> <b>eel,</b> shad, salmon, trout, pike, carp, and tench. Shellfish include mussels, cockles, periwinkles, clams, and oysters.|$|E
25|$|Fishery {{data for}} the Atlantic sawtail {{catshark}} is inadequate as it is still recorded as G. melastomus by observers. This species is caught incidentally on deepwater longlines and bottom trawls targeting other species, including wreckfish (Polyprion americanus), <b>conger</b> <b>eel</b> (Conger conger), Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), and red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus). Most landed sharks are discarded and likely suffer high mortality due to damage sustained during capture; the larger specimens are marketed for human consumption. Given the small extent of its range and the ubiquitous heavy fishing pressure within, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this shark as Near Threatened.|$|E
50|$|When <b>conger</b> <b>eels</b> {{are between}} 5 and 15 years old, their bodies undergo a transformation, with the {{reproductive}} organs of {{both males and}} females increasing in size and the skeleton reducing in mass and the teeth falling out. <b>Conger</b> <b>eels</b> then stop feeding and leave European waters and make the long migration to the subtropical areas of the Atlantic, such as the Sargasso Sea. Once in this area, they spawn, with the female producing 3 to 8 million eggs. Once hatched, the larval <b>conger</b> <b>eels</b> begin to swim back to European waters, where they live until they reach maturity and then begin to migrate to repeat the cycle.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{understand}} how marine ecosystems function, {{it is essential to}} study the trophic interactions among the community members, particularly from poorly known regions. In this study, the feeding ecology and diet of <b>conger</b> <b>eels,</b> <b>Conger</b> conger, an abundant fish species with commercial interest, was examined in the north-east Atlantic, off Algarve (southern Portugal) between May 2005 and August 2006. The diet was characterized by species composition, size and mass of prey. <b>Conger</b> <b>eels</b> are opportunistic feeders, cannibalistic, feeding on benthopelagic/pelagic prey (67 % by mass and 71 % by number) but also benthic prey (32 % by mass and 29 % by number). Fish (67. 8 + 4. 7 % in mass) are the main prey of <b>conger</b> <b>eels,</b> followed by cephalopods (16. 5 + 3. 8 %) and crustaceans (15. 6 + 3. 7 %). The most numerous (identifiable) fish consumed were Capros aper, occurring in 90 % of the stomach samples that contained food and representing 1. 4 % in mass, and Scomber japonicus, the most important fish in mass (21. 1 %), which occurred in 4. 2 % of the stomach samples that contained food. The present study shows that octopodids can play a more important role in the diet of <b>conger</b> <b>eels</b> than previously thought. Of the species preyed upon by <b>conger</b> <b>eels,</b> six species (21 % of the total prey taxa) are caught commercially (Trachurus trachurus, Scomber japonicus, Micromesistius poutassou, Helicolenus dactylopterus and Conger conger) by local fisheries. As discards by local trawl and longline fisheries do not correspond with the diet of C. conger, it is likely that most prey of C. conger in rocky areas were caught actively in that study region...|$|R

6000|$|Running hard to {{the help}} of Mr. Raeburn was the {{youngest}} Britling boy, a beautiful contrast.

But Mrs. Teddy, running as swiftly as her sister, was between Teddy and the ball. Whack! the little short man's stick had clashed with Cecily's. Confused things happened with sticks and feet, and the little short man appeared to be trying to cut down Cecily as one cuts down a tree, she tried to pass the ball to her centre forward--too late, and then Mrs. Teddy had intercepted it, and was flickering back towards Mr. Britling's goal in a rush in which Mr. Direck perceived it was his duty to join.|$|E

Truth to say, if he was now more reserved, there was a very good reason for it, for he played such havoc amongst the eatables that there was little time for talk. At last, after passing from the round of cold beef to a capon pasty, and topping up with a two-pound perch, washed down by a great jug of ale, he smiled upon us all and told us that his fleshly necessities were satisfied for the nonce.
