Subpart J specifies requirements for the design, construction, installation, operation, inspection, maintenance, repair, release, response, and closure of HazW tanks. Also, the regulations make a distinction between new and existing tanks. Effective December 6, 1995, standards for controlling volatile organic air emissions will apply to non-exempt HazW tanks. HazW tanks will have to be equipped with a <b>cover</b> or <b>floating</b> <b>roof,</b> or be designed to operate as a closed system, to be in compliance with the air emission control requirements.

50|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>roof</b> {{tanks are}} broadly divided into {{external}} <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tanks (usually called <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tanks: FR Tanks) and internal <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> types (IFR Tanks).|$|R
50|$|IFR {{tanks are}} used for liquids with low {{flash-point}}s (e.g., ATF, MS. gasoline, ethanol). These tanks are nothing but cone roof tanks with a <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> inside which travels up and down along with the liquid level. This <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> traps the vapor from low flash-point fuels. <b>Floating</b> <b>roofs</b> are supported with legs or cables on which they rest.FR tanks {{do not have a}} fixed roof (it is open in the top) and has a <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> only. Medium flash point liquids such as naphtha, kerosene, diesel, and crude oil are stored in these tanks.|$|R

The seismic response of {{these two types of}} structure in different site conditions and seismic intensity were calculated and the numerical solutions were compared. The results show that <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> has little impact on base shear and base moment in different site conditions and seismic intensity. <b>Floating</b> <b>roof</b> can effectively reduce the sloshing wave height. The influence of <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> on dynamic fluid pressure decreases with the increase of seismic intensity, which is less affected by ground conditions...|$|R
50|$|Some {{storage tanks}} need a <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> in {{addition}} to or {{in lieu of the}} fixed roof and structure. This <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> rises and falls with the liquid level inside the tank, thereby decreasing the vapor space above the liquid level. <b>Floating</b> <b>roofs</b> are considered a safety requirement as well as a pollution prevention measure for many industries including petroleum refining.|$|R
40|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>roofs</b> {{are widely}} used to prevent {{evaporation}} of content in large cylindrical aboveground oil storage tanks. The 2003 Hokkaido Earthquake caused severe damages to the <b>floating</b> <b>roofs</b> due to sloshing. These accidents became a cause to establish structural integrity of the <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tanks in sloshing. However, many designers {{do not have a}} solution for the sloshing of <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tanks except for three-dimensional FEA computer codes. The three-dimensional FEA requires a long computational time and expenses. The sloshing of <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tanks is a coupling vibration problem with fluid and structure.

40|$|Storage tanks {{have been}} widely used in many {{industrial}} particularly in the oil refinery and petrochemical industry which are to store a multitude of different product with crude oil as one if it. There are different types of tank such as fixed roof tank, open <b>roof</b> tank, <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tank etc. <b>Floating</b> <b>roof</b> tank is which the <b>roof</b> <b>floats</b> directly on top of the product, with no vapour space and eliminating the possibility of flammable atmosphere. There are various industrial code and standard available for the basic requirement for tank design and construction.

The aim of this project is to develop basic rules and procedures, highlighting the concerns in designing, construction and operation of a <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> by taking an existing Oil Development Project with it’s readily available information as a base, to design the tank, and identify the problematic and lesson learnt throughout the projec...|$|R
40|$|Storage {{of crude}} oil and {{petroleum}} products inevitably leads to evaporative losses. Those losses are important for the industrial plants mass balances, {{as well as for}} the environmental protection. In this paper, estimation of evaporative losses was performed using software program TANKS 409 d which was developed by the Agency for Environmental Protection of the United States - US EPA. Emissions were estimated for the following types of storage tanks: fixed conical roof tank, fixed dome <b>roof</b> tank, external <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tank, internal <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tank and domed external <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tank. Obtained results show quantities of evaporated losses per tone of stored liquid. Crude oil fixed roof storage tank losses are cca 0. 5 kg per tone {{of crude oil}}. For <b>floating</b> <b>roof,</b> crude oil losses are 0. 001 kg/t. Fuel oil (diesel fuel and heating oil) have the smallest evaporation losses, which are in order of magnitude 10 - 3 kg/tone. Liquids with higher Reid Vapour Pressure have very high evaporative losses for tanks with fixed roof, up to 2. 07 kg/tone. In case of external <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tank, losses are 0. 32 kg/tone. The smallest losses are for internal <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tank and domed external <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tank: 0. 072 and 0. 044, respectively. Finally, it can be concluded that the liquid with low volatility of low BTEX amount can be stored in tanks with fixed roof. In this case, the prevailing economic aspect, because the total amount of evaporative loss does not significantly affect the environment. On the other hand, storage of volatile derivatives with high levels of BTEX is not justified from the economic point of view or from the standpoint of the environment protection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{heat loss}} and surface {{temperature}} of the top surface and sidewall of large-scale <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tank is tested by the heat flow meter and surface temperature method. Based on the test data, the heat loss from the top surface is about twice more {{than that of the}} sidewall which means the top surface is the weakest insulation part of the <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tank. On the surface, the heat loss profile is in accord with the surface temperature distribution. Special attention is given on the calculation of thermal conductivity for the top surface and sidewall which finally deduced the total heat transfer coeffi-cient of large <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tank. Moreover, the heat loss of <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tank in different working conditions is predicted. According to the calculation results, the level of 6 m is regarded as a critical level determining the heat loss.

Applying integrated variational principles on deck plate and fluid facilitate the treatment of the compatibility of deformation between <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> and supporting liquid. Analysis results showed that different assumptions about deck plate formulation were commonly used in the literature which resulted in considerably different deflection and stress patterns on the <b>floating</b> <b>roof.</b> The results showed that modeling of the deck plate as a flexural element rather than membrane, by eliminating the need for nonlinear analysis, gave reasonable results for deflections and stresses in the deck plate. Finally, a simple and efficient procedure using linear finite element code analyzes of the <b>floating</b> <b>roofs,</b> considering only the flexural stiffness was developed...|$|R

It is {{pointed out that}} the present fire fighting systems of large scale crude oil storage depots cannot meet the need to extinguish full surface fires of large scale <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tanks. Adequate data of successful extinguishment of large scale tanks full surface fires and full scale tank fire experiments in the world are badly needed to design fire fighting system to extinguish full surface fires of large scale tanks in large scale crude oil storage depots. According to “Code of design for low expansion foam extinguishing system” and relative study results abroad, the fire fighting systems are calculated and designed to deal with full surface fires of large scale <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tanks. It is shown that designing parameters provided by API are more credible and large foam monitors act as the main fire extinguish facilities.

40|$|AbstractTanks with <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> {{have shown}} high {{vulnerability}} subjected to past earthquakes, such as Kobe, and Izmit. The {{main cause of}} damage {{is believed to be}} the interaction between the <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> and the tank wall. In this paper a simplified method is presented for modeling the <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> and its interaction with the tank wall, making it possible to use Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for calculating the seismic response of tank-floating roof system. In the proposed method, assuming that the sloshing phenomenon is mainly suppressed by the <b>floating</b> <b>roof,</b> the seal between the roof and the tank's wall is modeled by introducing some radial pre-compressed ‘only-compression elements’ all around the roof, itself substituted by a rigid disk, and the tank's wall is modeled by 3 -dimensional shell elements. The dynamic effect of the impounded oil in the tank is taken into account by the use of added mass concept. If during the time history analysis the maximum relative displacement between the roof disk and the tank's wall in any radial direction exceeds the initial length of the pre-compressed only-compression springs the tank is considered to be vulnerable. The proposed method has been applied to a tank sample in Kharg (southern Iran) island...|$|R
