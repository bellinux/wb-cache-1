5000|$|Because {{the port}} area {{did not fall}} within the {{jurisdiction}} of the local municipality, plans for buildings required the approval of the port engineer rather than that of the city council. The plans for the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> <b>facility</b> were, nonetheless, submitted to the council's fire department for comment. The fire department classified the store as [...] "moderate risk storage" [...] and required, in terms of the applicable SA Bureau of Standards code, the installation of a sprinkler system in the roof void and in the store itself. (No sprinkler system would have been required by a [...] "low risk" [...] classification.) At the time, only one or two cold stores in South Africa had sprinkler systems. The same was generally true of cold stores in the United Kingdom and Europe. After discussing the fire department's [...] "requirements" [...] with the project engineer and architect, and then consulting the National Building Regulations and SABS code, the port engineer concluded that the correct classification of the building was [...] "low risk" [...] and that a sprinkler system was accordingly not required. None was therefore installed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{unreasonable}} airflow distribution often {{occurs in}} the <b>cold</b> <b>store.</b> Some specific parameters of airflow in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> are difficult to obtain in the practical experiments. The unreasonable airflow causes quality decline and large energy consumption. In this paper, the airflow distributions in an empty commercial <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> and the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> filled with products were studied by CFD and investigated using the 3 D modeling method which combined SIMPLE calculation method and finite-volume method. Meshes of the fan were refined locally with the airflow near the walls was modified by applying the non-wall function. Through comparing the airflow distributions in the empty <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> and in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> filled with products, differences such as the lower margin velocity, the smaller width and the deviation of the main steam in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> filled with products were found...|$|R

Air {{curtains}} {{are commonly}} used to cut off air flow between the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> and hot environment, and reduce heat and mass transfer {{in order to maintain}} the low temperature in the <b>cold</b> <b>store.</b> CFD can be used to predict operation rule of air curtain used in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> intuitively and modelling is the most important part of numerical simulation of air curtain used in the <b>cold</b> <b>store.</b> In this study, different numerical models including standard εκ − model (with and without boussinesq approximation) and RSM (with and without boussinesq approximation) were used to simulate the temperature field and air flow field in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> and operation rule of air curtain used in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> after air curtain opened for 60 s. Meanwhile, the actual operation of air curtain used in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> was tested and the simulation values were compared with the experimental values. The results showed that the velocity of the central mainstream decayed slowly, but the velocity of both sides of air curtain decayed fast. The optimal model used to predict the temperature field and air flow field in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> and operation rule of air curtain used in the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> was standard εκ − model with boussinesq approximation, the relative error was within 20 %.

40|$|Most {{existing}} crop scheduling {{models are}} cultivar specific and are developed using academic resources. As such they rarely meet the particular {{needs of a}} grower. A series of protocols have been created to generate effective schedules for a changing product range using data generated on site at a commercial nursery. A screening programme has been developed to help determine a cultivar's photoperiod sensitivity and vernalisation requirement. Experimental conditions were obtained using a <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> <b>facility</b> set to 5 degreesC and photoperiod cloches. Eight and 16 hour photoperiod treatments were achieved at low cost by growing plants in cloches of opaque plastic with a motorised rolling screen. Natural light conditions were extended where necessary using a high pressure sodium lamp. Batches of plants were grown according to different schedules based on these treatments.

For chilled <b>cold</b> <b>stores,</b> 93 % of the variation in energy was related to store volume. For frozen stores, 56 % and for mixed stores, 67 % of the variation in energy consumption was related to store volume.

The simulation result showed that temperature of corner was highest in the <b>cold</b> <b>store.</b> The temperature change of the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> in the cooling process could be better predicted by using modified simulation method and the accuracy of numerical simulation of <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> in the cooling process could also be validated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To get the air {{distribution}} {{in a small}} <b>cold</b> <b>store,</b> a mini type <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> (4. 5 m (l) × 3. 3 m (w) × 2. 5 m (h)) was referenced. The model of the small <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> {{was established in the}} software named GAMBIT and after this the three-dimensional numerical simulation was used. The different simulation result was verified by the experiments. The accuracy of simulation in airflow field in <b>cold</b> <b>stores</b> was studied by comparison of various mesh rezoning, various decoupling methods for airflow speed and pressure. The results showed that 10 cm dimensional accuracy was the suitable mesh size for the calculation speed without affecting the simulation accuracy, and the SIMPLE algorithm was better for the PISQ algorithms to simulate steady air flow of the cooling process in a <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> without products. It was concluded that there was a large circumfluence in the flow field, the speeds in the center and corner were lower than those in other places. The distribution of flow speed in the horizontal plane had a good symmetrical, however that in the vertical plane was lower than that in the center, but higher upwards and downwards.

40|$|AbstractObjective of the {{research}} was to determine ambient temperature and relative humidity distributions of two different <b>cold</b> <b>stores</b> which have two different cooling systems. One of the <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> which is called as Cold store-I, has classical cooling system such as compressor, condenser and evaporator.

Computational fluid dynamics was used for modelling of distribution of temperature and relative humidity of <b>cold</b> <b>store</b> walls. Storage temperature and relative humidity were assumed 2 °C and 90 %, respectively. Boundary conditions were set as; Inlet-Surface of fluid inlet, Outlet-Surface of fluid outlet, and walls-solid, proof against flow of fluid.
