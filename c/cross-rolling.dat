40|$|The {{evolution}} of microstructure and texture in commercially pure titanium {{has been studied}} {{as a function of}} strain path during rolling using experimental techniques and viscoplastic self-consistent simulations. Four different strain paths, namely unidirectional rolling, two-step cross rolling, multistep cross rolling, and reverse rolling, have been employed to decipher the effect of strain path change on the {{evolution of}} deformation texture and microstructure. The <b>cross-rolled</b> samples show higher hardness with lower microstrain and intragranular misorientation compared to the unidirectional rolled sample as determined from X-ray diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction, respectively. The higher hardness of the <b>cross-rolled</b> samples is attributed to orientation hardening due to the near basal texture. Viscoplastic self-consistent simulations are able to successfully predict the texture evolution of the differently rolled samples. Simulation results indicate the higher contribution of basal slip in the formation of near basal texture and as well as lower intragranular misorientation in the <b>cross-rolled</b> samples...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the authors}} numerically {{simulate}} roll vortices (rolls) {{generated by the}} inflection-point instability in the hurricane boundary layer (HBL). The approach is based on embedding a two-dimensional high-resolution single-grid roll-resolving model (SRM) at selected horizontal grid points of an axisymmetric HBL model. The results from a set of idealized experiments indicate that the mixed-layer height {{is an important factor}} affecting the magnitude of the roll velocities and the structure of the internal waves triggered in the stably stratified layer above. This study reveals the important difference between the roll-induced <b>cross-roll</b> (nearly radial) and along-roll (nearly azimuthal) momentum fluxes: while the <b>cross-roll</b> momentum flux is well correlated to the <b>cross-roll</b> mean wind shear, the along-roll momentum flux is typically not correlated with the along-roll mean wind shear. Therefore, the commonly used K theory in the boundary layer parameterizations cannot reasonably capture the vertical distribution of the roll-induced along-roll momentum flux. Moreover, the authors find that the rolls induce more significant changes in the mean radial wind profile than in the mean azimuthal wind profile. Specifically, rolls reduce the inflow near surface, enhance the inflow at upper levels, and increase the inflow-layer height. Based on a linear dynamical HBL model, the authors find that the impact of rolls on the mean radial wind profile is essentially due to their redistribution effect on the mean azimuthal momentum in the HB...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{describes}} {{the evolution of}} microstructure and texture in an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Zr-based 7010 aluminum alloy during different modes of hot <b>cross-rolling.</b> Processing of materials involves three different types of <b>cross-rolling.</b> The development of texture in the one-step cross-rolled specimen can be described by a typical beta-fiber having the maximum intensity near Copper (Cu) component. However, for the multi-step cross-rolled specimens, the as-rolled texture is mainly characterized by a strong rotated-Brass (Bs) component and a very weak rotated-cube component. Subsequent heat treatment leads to sharpening of the major texture component (i. e., rotated-Bs). Furthermore, the main texture components in all the specimens appear to be significantly rotated in a complex manner away from their ideal positions because of non-symmetric deformations in the two rolling directions. Detailed microstructural study indicates that dynamic recovery is the dominant restoration mechanism operating during the hot rolling. During subsequent heat treatment, static recovery dominates, while a combination of particle-stimulated nucleation (PSN) and strain-induced grain boundary migration (SIBM) causes partial recrystallization of the grain structure. The aforementioned restoration mechanisms {{play an important role}} in the development of texture components. The textural development in the current study could be attributed to the combined effects of (a) <b>cross-rolling</b> and inter-pass annealing that reduce the intensity of Cu component after each successive pass, (b) recrystallization resistance of Bs-oriented grains, (c) stability of Bs texture under <b>cross-rolling,</b> and (d) Zener pinning by Al 3 Zr dispersoids...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} change in strain path during cold rolling on the {{evolution}} of microstructure and texture is investigated. For this purpose, high purity aluminum and Al- 2. 5 %Mg alloy are deformed (∼ 90 % reduction in thickness) by unidirectional and cross cold rolling. Irrespective of the alloy system, copper-type texture is observed in unidirectional processed materials, while strong brass ({ 011 } 112) texture is developed during cross rolling. Unidirectionally rolled aluminum showed higher HAGB fraction, but similar HAGB spacing as compared to the <b>cross-rolled</b> aluminum after 90 % reduction in thickness. At the same time, the internal misorientation in the <b>cross-rolled</b> 2 N-Al is higher than in the unidirectionally rolled material.

40|$|International audienceRayleigh-Bénard {{convection}} in {{a horizontal}} layer of a non-Newtonian fluid between slabs of arbitrary thickness and finite thermal conductivity is considered. The {{first part of}} the paper deals with the primary bifurcation and the relative stability of convective patterns at threshold. Weakly nonlinear analysis combined with Stuart-Landau equation is used. The competition between squares and rolls, {{as a function of the}} shear-thinning degree of the fluid, the slabs' thickness, and the ratio of the thermal conductivity of the slabs to that of the fluid is investigated. Computations of heat transfer coefficients are in agreement with the maximum heat transfer principle. The second part of the paper concerns the stability of the convective patterns toward spatial perturbations and the determination of the band width of the stable wave number in the neighborhood of the critical Rayleigh number. The approach used is based on the Ginzburg-Landau equations. The study of rolls stability shows that: (i) for low shear-thinning effects, the band of stable wave numbers is bounded by zigzag instability and <b>cross-roll</b> instability. Furthermore, the marginal <b>cross-roll</b> stability boundary enlarges with increasing shear-thinning properties; (ii) for high shear-thinning effects, Eckhaus instability becomes more dangerous than <b>cross-roll</b> instability. For square patterns, the wave number selection is always restricted by zigzag instability and by " rectangular Eckhaus " instability. In addition, the width of the stable wave number decreases with increasing shear-thinning effects.

40|$|Two {{grades of}} {{austenitic}} stainless steel (ASS), types 304 (UNS S 30400) and 316 L (UNS S 31603), were cold rolled to different reductions by unidirectional and by <b>cross-rolling.</b> The steels had reasonable difference in stacking fault energy (estimated respectively as 15 and 61 mJ/m(2) in types 304 and 316 L) and also in starting (or pre-deformation) crystallographic texture-being relatively weak and reasonably strong in types 304 and 316 L respectively. The cold rolling increased texturing in type 304, but not in type 316 L ASS. The more significant effect of cold rolled texture development was in the relative increase of Brass ({ 011 }) against Copper ({ 112 }) and S ({ 231 }) orientations. In type 304 the increase in Brass was significant, while in type 316 L the increase in Copper and S was stronger. This effect could be captured by Taylor type deformation texture simulations considering stronger twinning contributions in type 304 -for example the respective 'best-fits' (in terms of matching {{the changes in the}} volume fractions of Brass against Copper and S) were obtained by full constraint Taylor model with 1 : 100 and 1 : 10 slip: twin activities in types 304 and 316 L ASS respectively. Microstructural developments during cold rolling were generalized as strain induced martensite formation and developments of dislocation substructure. The former, as estimated by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), increased with cold reduction, being significantly more in type 304 and was also noticeably stronger in both grades under <b>cross-rolling.</b> The most significant aspect of substructural developments was the formation of strain localizations. These were observed as dense dislocation walls (DDWs), micro-bands (MBs) and twin lamellar structures (TLS). The TLS contribution gained significance at higher reductions and during <b>cross-rolling,</b> especially in type 304.

In order to avoid deformation induced phase transformation and dynamic strain aging, the rolling was carried out at an optimized temperature of 898 K (625 °C) at the warm-deformation range. The microstructure after cross warm-rolling revealed a lamellar structure with alternate arrangement of the bands of two phases.

It {{is well known that}} the thermo-mechanical processing parameters strongly influence both the evolution of texture as well as microstructure in the material. As a result, the semi-finished products exhibit anisotropy in mechanical properties causing legitimate concerns on the applicability of the alloys. In the present thesis, a systematic study on the evolution of texture and microstructure and its implications on the mechanical properties anisotropy of AA 7010 alloy has been attempted. A brief introduction on the development of texture and its influence on the anisotropy of the mechanical properties of 7 xxx series {{aluminum alloy}}s is presented first with a view to explore the scopes for further investigation. An overview of the relevant literature is described subsequently. The development of texture and microstructure in an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Zr based 7010 aluminum alloy during uneven, hot <b>cross-rolling</b> is presented. Materials processing involves three different types of uneven <b>cross-rolling.</b> The variations in relative intensity of the β-fibre components as a function of cross rolling modes have been investigated. It has been shown that the main attributes to the texture evolution in the present study are (a) <b>cross-rolling</b> and inter-pass annealing that reduce the intensity of Cu component following each successive pass, (b) recrystallization resistance of Bs oriented grains, (c) stability of Bs texture under <b>cross-rolling,</b> and (d) Zener pinning by Al 3 Zr dispersoids. The stability of the unique single, rotated Brass-{ 110 }(556) component developed in the present alloy, during long term thermal annealing and cold rolling deformation has been systematically investigated further. Subsequently, the influence of development of microstructure and texture on the in-plane anisotropy (AIP) of yield strength, work hardening behavior and yield locus anisotropy has been presented. The AIP and work hardening behavior are evaluated by tensile testing at 0 o, 45 o and 90 o to the rolling direction, whilst yield loci have been generated by Knoop hardness method. It has been observed that in spite of having strong rotated Brass texture, the specimens show low AIP especially in peak aged temper. The in-plane anisotropy (AIP) of yield strength, and work hardening behavior of a heat treated 7010 aluminum alloy sheet having strong, rotated Brass-{ 110 } 556  component with different texture intensity and volume fraction of recrystallization has been further evaluated. It is observed that the AIP increases with increase in texture intensity and volume fraction of recrystallization.
