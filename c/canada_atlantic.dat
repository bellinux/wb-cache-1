5|$|Canada is a {{federation}} {{composed of}} ten provinces and three territories. In turn, {{these may be}} grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central <b>Canada,</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as health care, education, and welfare. Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, {{the federal government can}} initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the Canada Health Act; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.|$|E
25|$|MacKinnon's first {{experience}} with Hockey Canada came when he {{was named to the}} <b>Canada</b> <b>Atlantic</b> team for the 2011 World U-17 Hockey Challenge in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Despite being the second-youngest player at the tournament, MacKinnon scored five goals and eight points in only five games to finish seventh in tournament scoring. This included a game in which he scored two goals and two assists to be named player of the game as <b>Canada</b> <b>Atlantic</b> defeated Finland 4–3. His impressive play helped <b>Canada</b> <b>Atlantic</b> to its best finish since the 2005 World U-17 Hockey Challenge, defeating Canada West 2–1 in the fifth place game.

25|$|Booth also {{operated}} grain elevators at Depot Harbour, Coteau, Duluth and Milwaukee, and steamships on the Great Lakes, {{and formed}} the <b>Canada</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Transit Company, which operated five large lake freighters on the Upper Great Lakes.|$|E
25|$|Prompted by {{the federal}} government, the Grand Trunk Railway began {{negotiating}} with Booth to acquire the <b>Canada</b> <b>Atlantic</b> {{as part of the}} Grand Trunk's efforts to expand into northern Ontario and eventually into Western Canada. In August 1904 the GTR agreed to purchase the <b>Canada</b> <b>Atlantic</b> system, including the Great Lakes steamship fleet and the line in Vermont which connected with its Central Vermont Railway subsidiary. The agreed-upon price for the entire system as well as the Depot Harbour and Ottawa terminals was $16,000,000. The Grand Trunk took over all operations of the CAR on 1 October 1905, but the actual purchase was ratified by Parliament only in 1914. Booth was subsequently one of the GTR's directors until its nationalization as part of the Canadian National Railways in 1923.|$|E
25|$|Booth's sawmill {{operations}} {{could never}} run at full capacity because the output {{could not be}} carried out of the lumber yards fast enough. Because of these transportation problems in the Ottawa area, Booth became an important participant {{in the development of}} Canada's railway system when he purchased the Montreal and City of Ottawa Junction Railway (M) and the Coteau and Province Line Railway and Bridge Company (C) in 1879, amalgamating them to form the <b>Canada</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Railway. The M had received a charter to build southeast from Ottawa to Coteau Landing on the north bank of the St. Lawrence River. The C had received a charter to build a bridge across the St. Lawrence River to Valleyfield, Quebec and then operate a railway across southwestern Quebec to the United States border. Due to financial difficulties, neither line had been completed, and Booth worked to complete the entire route by 1882. The Coteau bridge was completed in 1890, thus eliminating the necessity of transshipping cargo by barge. The CAR formed a subsidiary, the Vermont and Province Line Railroad, which would build a line to Swanton, Vermont on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain in 1897, thus connecting Ottawa to the United States via the Delaware and Hudson Railway, the Rutland Railroad, and the Central Vermont Railway.|$|E

2500|$|John Rudolphus Booth (April 5, 1827 [...] December 8, 1925) was a Canadian lumber {{king and}} {{railroad}} baron.
