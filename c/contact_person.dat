40|$|BACKGROUND: Persons {{with less}} severe disabilities {{are able to}} express their needs and show {{initiatives}} in social <b>contacts,</b> <b>persons</b> with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD), however, depend on others for this. This study analysed the structure of informal networks of persons with PIMD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data concerning the number, type and frequency of contacts were collected in 205 persons with PIMD. RESULTS: The mean number of <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> was 5. 1 (range: 0 - 26, SD: 4. 2) per year. 79. 4 % of the <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> are family, {{with an average of}} 72. 3 contacts per year. Parents had significantly more contact compared to the other informal <b>contact</b> <b>persons.</b> In 2. 2 % of the sample contacts with peers were seen. CONCLUSIONS: The informal networks of persons with PIMD consist mainly of family. The question arises how informal networks can be expanded and which role professionals have in this process...|$|R

40|$|A {{broad range}} of {{infectious}} diseases such as influenza, measles and Ebola are transmitted through direct or close human contact. These pathogens do not spread randomly through a population, but follow the structure of human contact networks. Making use of these networks may help to understand and control the spread of infectious diseases. In this thesis, we introduce online respondent-driven detection (RDD). With RDD, individuals are asked to recruit <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> from their network via the Internet. <b>Contact</b> <b>persons</b> are then asked to do the same, resulting in successive waves of <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> as respondents. The aims of this thesis were to investigate the feasibility of using online RDD (I) to study infectious disease transmission within contact networks and (II) to enhance case finding during outbreaks of emerging or re-emerging pathogens. We conducted empirical studies in Thailand and the Netherlands to pilot the use of online RDD for sampling contacts of contacts of individuals in the general population. Participants were asked to record their numbers of <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> at different settings and self-reported influenza-like-illness symptoms, and to invite four persons whom they had met in the preceding weeks. In {{the first part of}} thesis, we investigated mixing patterns by analysing correlations between recruiters and their recruitees. Such information is needed for mathematical models that provide evidence-based support for outbreak preparedness and interventions. We found that participants had a tendency to invite <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> with similar socio-demographic characteristics, but they did not preferably invite persons who also reported similar numbers of <b>contact</b> <b>persons.</b> In the second part of this thesis, we analysed self-reported symptoms of individuals linked in recruitment chains and observed that symptomatic participants recruited other symptomatic participants. This suggests that RDD can enhance identification of hitherto ‘hidden’ cases that go unnoticed by traditional surveillance systems, especially for infectious disease outbreaks in which the majority of symptomatic patients do not seek health care. Online RDD also has large geographical coverage and can provide timely, detailed information about individuals and their contacts. However, RDD has important limitations concerning peer recruitment. During all our studies, sample sizes of recruitment remained small. To increase our understanding of factors important for the success of the recruitment process, we developed a stochastic simulation model where parameters were suggested by our empirically collected data. This model is useful for preparing future RDD surveys, e. g., by providing input on the required mean number of successfully sent invitations to reach large recruitment trees. In practice, however, it remains challenging to motivate participants to invite others. More empirical research is needed to understand the reasons why people choose to invite others, why they choose to invite specific <b>contact</b> <b>persons,</b> which recruitment options are most convenient for them and why or why not their <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> decide to participate. If peer recruitment can be further increased, our research shows that online RDD has great potential for enhancing case finding and improving epidemiological knowledge on the transmission of pathogens within contact networks...|$|R

40|$|Background: Transmission of {{respiratory}} pathogens {{in a population}} depends on the contact network patterns of individuals. To accurately understand and explain epidemic behaviour information on contact networks is required, but only limited empirical data is available. Online respondent-driven detection can provide relevant epidemiological data on numbers of <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> and dynamics of contacts between pairs of individuals. We aimed to analyse contact networks with respect to sociodemographic and geographical characteristics, vaccine-induced immunity and self-reported symptoms. Methods: In 2014, volunteers from two large participatory surveillance panels in the Netherlands and Belgium were invited for a survey. Participants were asked to record numbers of contacts at different locations and self-reported influenza-like-illness symptoms, and to invite 4 individuals they had met face to face in the preceding 2 weeks. We calculated correlations between linked individuals to investigate mixing patterns. Results: In total 1560 individuals completed the survey who reported in total 30591 contact persons; 488 recruiterrecruit pairs were analysed. Recruitment was assortative by age, education, household size, influenza vaccination status and sentiments, indicating that participants tended to recruit <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> similar to themselves. We also found assortative recruitment by symptoms, reaffirming our objective of sampling <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> whom a participant may infect or by whom a participant may get infected {{in case of an}} outbreak. Recruitment was random by sex and numbers of <b>contact</b> <b>persons.</b> Relationships between pairs were influenced by the spatial distribution of peer recruitment. Conclusions: Although complex mechanisms influence online peer recruitment, the observed statistical relationships reflected the observed contact network patterns in the general population relevant for the transmission {{of respiratory}} pathogens.

Methods: Psychosocial distress was measured between 04 - 07 / 2009 using the distress thermometer and problem list. All patients were asked 3 questions: To whom do you talk, when you are distressed? Which persons are helpful to reduce your distress? How did helpful persons help you? Results: 202 patients with a median age of 68 years (37 - 85) completed the interview. Most important <b>contact</b> <b>persons</b> named by patients were: oncologist (84 %), partner (71 %), children (64 %), friends (53 %) and general practitioner (52 %). The most helpful persons were oncologist (97 %), friends (94 %), partner (92 %), children (92 %) and general practitioner (91 %) {{and the most important}} qualities of help were listening, patience and mindfulness.
