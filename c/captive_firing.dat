25|$|Before launch, two <b>Captive</b> <b>Firing</b> Tests were {{conducted}} on the rocket which was to launch HTV-1. The first test, which consisted of firing the first stage for ten seconds, was originally scheduled to occur at 02:30 UTC on 27 March 2009, however it was cancelled after the launch pad's coolant system failed to activate. This was later discovered to {{have been due to}} a manual supply valve not being open. The test was rescheduled for 1 April, but then postponed again due to a leak in a pipe associated with the launch facility's fire suppression system. The test was rescheduled for 2 April, when it was successfully conducted at 05:00 UTC. Following this, the second test, which involved a 150-second burn of the first stage, was scheduled for 20 April. This was successfully conducted at 04:00 UTC on 22 April, following a two-day delay due to unfavourable weather conditions. A ground test, using a battleship mockup of the rocket was subsequently conducted on 11 July.|$|E

40|$|In view of {{the complex}} flight {{operation}} of the Space Shuttle propulsion system together with an expected launch rate increase, the flight performance reconstruction process needs to be performed by automated computer programs. These programs must {{have the capability to}} quickly and reliably determine the true behavior of the various components of the propulsion system. For the flight reconstruction, measured values from the solid rocket motors, liquid engines, and trajectory are appraised through the Kalman filter technique to identify the most likely flight propulsion performance. A more detailed data collection program for the single SSME engine <b>captive</b> test <b>firing</b> evaluation is scheduled for startup in September of 1988. Engine performance evaluation for the <b>captive</b> test <b>firing</b> requires a reconstruction process that is similar to the process that is used for the flight reconstruction. Analytical tools that may be used to reconstruct a propulsion system's true performance under flight and/or test conditions are described...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{an overall}} program to {{investigate}} the vibrational environment of small solid-propellant rockets, a <b>captive</b> test <b>firing</b> of a Nike rocket with a boilerplate payload was conducted in a unique test stand which, while restraining the total vehicle displacement, allowed substantial freedom for the test vehicle to vibrate.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Stoner joined Knight's Armament Company. He {{continued}} his AR-10 design work and joined {{it with the}} direct gas system of the AR-15. The end result was the SR-25 (adding together the numbers of the AR-10 and AR-15) which improved the AR-10 design with M16A2 advancements and parts commonality. The original SR-25 was released in the early 1990s and had a heavy free-floating 24 in match grade barrel with a fiberglass handguard. It had a flat top upper receiver with a Mil-Std 1913 rail for mounting optics and a 2-stage match grade trigger. The bolt carrier {{was similar to the}} AR-10's, being chrome plated and having a <b>captive</b> <b>firing</b> pin retainer pin. The SR-25 was designed specifically to fire 168 gr g open-tip match cartridges. Accuracy was guaranteed at or under 1 minute of angle. At first, AR-10 type 20-round magazines were used, but they were later replaced by steel 20-round magazines resembling those used by the M16.|$|E

By {{the end of the}} month 118 Acadians arrived and about 30 Mi’kmaq from Ile St. Jean and the Miramachi. Boishebert arrived in June with 70 more Acadia militia members from Ile St. Jean and 60 Mi’kmaq militia. On June 2, The British vessels arrived and the militias went to their {{defensive}} positions on the shore. The 200 British vessels waited for six days, until the weather conditions were right, before they attacked on June 8. Four companies of Rogers Rangers under the command of George Scott were the first to come ashore in advance of James Wolfe. The British came ashore at Anse de la Cormorandiere and [...] "continuous fire was poured upon the invaders". The Mi'kmaq and Acadian militias fought the Rangers until the latter were supported by Scott and James Wolfe, which led to the militias retreat. Seventy of the militia were captured and 50 others scalped. The Mi'kmaq and Acadian militias killed 100 British, some of whom were wounded and drowned. On June 16, 50 Mi'kmaq returned to the cove and took 5 seaman <b>captive,</b> <b>firing</b> at the other British marines.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} day Tom drove Lafayette home and ordered his family to pack their belongings for a long trip. They loaded up the wagons and headed North. Tom's oldest son David Witter Campbell drove the herd South to Mexico in order to deny the Confederacy use of the cattle. Thomas L. Campbell was 51 years old. His oldest son Witter was 29. The youngest, Texanna was 8 years old. The family would not learn what happened to Witter for over four years.|$|R
5000|$|Demand {{build up}} {{measures}} can be initiated to consume the cheaper electricity (average price Rs 2.5 per kWhr) {{available from the}} grid instead of running the coal/gas/oil <b>fired</b> <b>captive</b> power plants in various electricity intensive industries. The captive power generation capacity by coal/gas/oil fired plants is nearly 47,000 MW mainly established in steel, fertiliser, aluminium, cement, etc. industries. These bulk captive electricity producers can draw cheaper electricity from the grid on short term open access (STOA) basis and avoid the costly imported coal/RLNG/natural gas or utilise these fuels for process purposes instead of electricity generation. Some of these idling captive power plants {{can be used for}} grid reserve service for earning extra revenue. At present substantial diesel oil is consumed by railways for rail traffic on its non electrified rail lines. To eliminate the substantial cost of imported diesel fuel, power ministry is envisaging to fund the electrification of these lines and achieve additional power demand of 7 billion units.|$|R
60|$|To {{quit the}} lake and lead their new <b>captive</b> to the <b>fire</b> {{occupied}} the Indians but another minute. So much engaged were they all with the struggle and its consequences, that the canoe was unseen, though it still lay so near the shore as to render every syllable that was uttered perfectly intelligible to the Delaware and his betrothed; and the whole party left the spot, some continuing the pursuit after Hist, along the beach, though most proceeded to the light. Here Deerslayer's antagonist so far recovered his breath and his recollection, for he had been throttled nearly to strangulation, as to relate {{the manner in which}} the girl had got off. It was now too late to assail the other fugitives, for no sooner was his friend led into the bushes than the Delaware placed his paddle into the water, and the light canoe glided noiselessly away, holding its course towards the centre of the lake until safe from shot, after which it sought the Ark. When Deerslayer reached the fire, he found himself surrounded by no less than eight grim savages, among whom was his old acquaintance Rivenoak. As soon as the latter caught a glimpse of the captive's countenance, he spoke apart to his companions, and a low but general exclamation of pleasure and surprise escaped them. They knew that the conqueror of their late friend, he who had fallen on the opposite side of the lake, was in their hands, and subject to their mercy, or vengeance. There was no little admiration mingled in the ferocious looks that were thrown on the prisoner; an admiration that was as much excited by his present composure, as by his past deeds. This scene may be said to have been the commencement of the great and terrible reputation that Deerslayer, or Hawkeye, as he was afterwards called, enjoyed among all the tribes of New York and Canada; a reputation that was certainly more limited in its territorial and numerical extent, than those which are possessed in civilized life, but which was compensated for what it wanted in these particulars, perhaps, by its greater justice, and the total absence of mystification and management.|$|R
5000|$|... 1571: Moscow burned; {{more than}} 30 cities looted, about 60,000 <b>captives.</b> See also <b>Fire</b> of Moscow (1571). In spring {{occurred}} {{one of the}} worst Tatar invasions of Muscovy. Crimean Khan Devlet I Giray, knowing from prisoners and deserters of the problems of the Moscow state - [...] "море" [...] (sic) and drought, the unending Livonian War, the concentration of only a few Russian regiments on the Oka River fords at Kolomna and Serpukhov - launched his most successful campaign against Russia. The Khan originally planned to raid near Kozelsk and led his horde to the upper Oka (the north-flowing part southwest of the defense line). Forcing this river at the Bystry ford, the horde moved toward Bolkhov and Kozelsk. But on Zlynsky Field he accepted the suggestion of a defector form Belyov, Boyar-son Kudeyar Tishenkov, to go straight to Moscow. The traitor promised to lead the horde through unprotected [...] "perelazhy" [...] on the upper Zhizdra River, a place where the Crimeans had never been. This flanking maneuver was completely unexpected. In mid-May 40,000 Tatars crossed the Zhizdra near Peremyshl(?), bypassed the Russian troops from the rear west of the Oka-bank-line west of Kaluga and advanced on Moscow. With a sudden attack they destroyed the troops of royal ataman Yakov Volynsky. Ivan the Terrible, hearing of this dangerous breakthrough and the approaching enemy troops, fled from Serpukhov past Moscow to Rostov, and planned to go further in Yaroslavl. Voyevods Prince I. D. Belsky, Prince I. F. Mstyslavsky, and Prince M. N. Vortynsky rapidly marched from Kolomna to Moscow, trying to get ahead of the Tatar horde and got there one day ahead of the Crimean Khan (23 May). They placed themselves {{on the other side of}} the river from the Kremlin and beyond the Moscow River and prepared for battle. After losing the first skirmishes the Khan camped at the village of Kolomenskoye and sent 20,000 Tatars to burn the outlying parts of the city. The outskirts were burned along with the earthen fortress and many Muscovites were killed. Tatars began to plunder and ravage the Moscow district. On 25 May Devlet Giray left Moscow for Kashira and Ryazan, sending out raiding parties to take captives. Soon, loaded with loot and a huge number of captives, the Crimeans returned to the steppes. On their way they passed through the Ryazan land and captured and burned Kashira. Prince Mikhail Vorotyinskiy with forward regiment followed the retreating enemy, but because of the small number of troops could not prevent them from ravaging and destroying the Russian land. During this invasion 36 Russian cities were destroyed and many people taken prisoner. The Crimean ambassador to Lithuania later boasted that the Tatars had killed 60,000 people and taken the same number captive. At the same time the Great Nogai Horde, as allies of the Crimeans raided the Kazan area at Tetyushi and Alatyr.|$|R
