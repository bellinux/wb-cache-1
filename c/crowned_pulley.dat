50|$|In {{the case}} of a drum-style pulley, without a groove or flanges, the pulley often is {{slightly}} convex to keep the flat belt centred. It is sometimes referred to as a <b>crowned</b> <b>pulley.</b> Though once widely used on factory line shafts, this type of pulley is still found driving the rotating brush in upright vacuum cleaners, in belt sanders and bandsaws. Agricultural tractors built up to the early 1950s generally had a belt pulley for a flat belt (which is what Belt Pulley magazine was named after). It has been replaced by other mechanisms with more flexibility in methods of use, such as power take-off and hydraulics.|$|E
