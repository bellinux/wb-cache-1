40|$|From Introduction: Wax and wax-like {{substances}} {{have been}} defined in many ways. One reasonably extensive definition, by Hatt and Lamberton (1956) is given below: "The term "wax" seems best used to denote {{a group of}} substances which qualitatively have certain physical properties in common. These properties are familiar ones, for in almost all countries some natural wax - beeswax, Japan <b>wax,</b> <b>Chinese</b> insect <b>wax,</b> the carnauba and candelilla waxes of the Americas - {{has been an important}} material in art and industry from prehistoric times. Waxes are understood to be opaque or translucent solids, which melt without decomposition to form mobile liquids at temperatures in the region of 100 ⁰C. They differ in hardness, but are all essentially soft substances with poor mechanical strength. Most waxes can be easily shaped or kneaded at a little above ambient temperatures. In fact, the term could easily have been made to cover the whole class now named thermoplastics. " Pure n-paraffins would be too crystalline and brittle for use as waxes, whereas mixtures of n-paraffins have some valuable properties. The molecules bear such close resemblance to one another that they form mixed crystals of lowered crystallinity and the melting point {{is a function of the}} mean molecular weight. This is a desirable feature for it permits crystallinity and brittleness to be reduced without a marked loss in the melting point or hardness. It also allows a mixture to simulate a pure compound very closely. Waxes, in general, have been put to a large number of uses. They are used, for example, in candles, polishes, paper-coating, plastics, printing, matches, rust protectants and insulation. Each application requires its own appropriate range of wax properties...|$|R
30|$|The <b>Chinese</b> white <b>wax</b> scale insect, Ericerus pela, is a {{well-known}} resource insect species, owing to its role in wax production and has been bred in China for over one thousand years. White wax, produced by the male second-instar larvae, is widely used in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and cosmetics industries. However, female E. pela cannot produce wax. In addition, females and males are dramatically distinct at each developmental stage. The males undergo holometabolous-like development, developing through egg, first- and second-stage nymph, pupal (prepupal and pupal), and adult stages and emerging as winged adults. The second-instar male nymphal period lasts 2  months, which is a relatively long period, whereas the male adult period lasts only 1  week because the males die immediately after mating (Chen 2011). In contrast, the females undergo neotenous development, developing through egg, first- and second-stage nymph, and adult stages. The female adult period is approximately 8  months and is the longest developmental stage in E. plea. E. pela is widely distributed from the subtropics to temperate areas in China, Korea, and Japan. Individuals can survive a high temperature of 44.0  °C and a low temperature of − 30.4  °C in these areas (Chen 2011).|$|R
40|$|Wax gourd is {{a popular}} {{vegetable}} in East Asia. In traditional <b>Chinese</b> medicine, <b>wax</b> gourd peel is used to prevent and treat metabolic diseases such as hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. However, there is no experimental evidence to support these applications. Here, we examined {{the effect of the}} extract of wax gourd peel (EWGP) on metabolic disorders in diet-induced C 57 BL/ 6 obese mice. In the preventive experiment, EWGP blocked body weight gain and lowered serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), liver TG and TC contents, and fasting blood glucose in mice fed with a high-fat diet. In the therapeutic study, we induced obesity in the mice and treated with EWGP for two weeks. We found that EWGP treatment reduced serum and liver triglyceride (TG) contents and fasting blood glucose and improved glucose tolerance in the mice. Reporter assay and gene expression analysis showed that EWGP could inhibit peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) transactivities and could decrease mRNA levels of PPARγ and its target genes. We also found that HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) was downregulated in the mouse liver by EWGP. Our data suggest that EWGP lowers hyperlipidemia of C 57 BL/ 6 mice induced by high-fat diet via the inhibition of PPARγ and HMGCR signaling...|$|R

40|$|Background: The <b>Chinese</b> white <b>wax</b> scale, Ericerus pela Chavannes is {{economically}} {{significant for}} {{its role in}} wax production. This insect has been bred in China for over a thousand years. The wax secreted by the male scale insect during the secondinstar larval stage has been widespread used in wax candle production, <b>wax</b> printing, engraving, <b>Chinese</b> medicine, and more recently in the chemical, pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetics industries. However, {{little is known about}} the mechanisms responsible for white wax biosynthesis. The characterization of its larval transcriptome may promote better understanding of wax biosynthesis. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, characterization of the transcriptome of E. pela during peak wax secretion was performed using Illumina sequencing technology. Illumina sequencing produced 41, 839 unigenes. These unigenes were annotated by blastx alignment against the NCBI Non-Redundant (NR), Swiss-Prot, KEGG, and COG databases. A total of 104 unigenes related to white wax biosynthesis were identified, and 15 of them were selected for quantitative real-time PCR analysis. We evaluated the variations in gene expression across different development stages, including egg, first/second instar larvae, male pupae, and male and female adults. Then we identified five genes involved in white wax biosynthesis. These genes were expressed most strongly during the second-instar larval stage of male E. pela. Conclusion/Significance: The transcriptome analysis of E. pela during peak wax secretion provided an overview of gen...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, China and India {{have become}} the most {{important}} economic partners of Africa and their footprints are growing by leaps and bounds, transforming Africa's international relations in a dramatic way. Although the overall impact of China and India's engagement in Africa has been positive in the short-term, {{partly as a result of}} higher returns from commodity exports fuelled by excessive demands from both countries, little research exists on the actual impact of China and India's growing involvement on Africa's economic transformation. This book examines in detail the opportunities and challenges posed by the increasing presence of China and India in Africa, and proposes critical interventions that African governments must undertake in order to negotiate with China and India from a stronger and more informed platform.

40|$|Soft wax scale (SWS) Ceroplastes {{destructor}} (Newstead) and <b>Chinese</b> <b>wax</b> scale (CWS) C. sinensis Del Guercio (Hemiptera: Coccidae) are indirect pests {{of citrus}} (Citrus spp.) in New Zealand. Honeydew they produce supports sooty mould fungi that disfigure fruit and reduce photosynthesis and fruit yield. Presently, control relies on calendar applications of insecticides. The main {{aim of this}} study was to provide the ecological basis for the integrated management of SWS and CWS. Specific objectives were to compare their population ecologies, determine major mortality factors and levels of natural control, quantify the impact of ladybirds on scale populations, and evaluate pesticides for compatibility with ladybirds. Among 57 surveyed orchards, SWS was more abundant than CWS in Kerikeri but was not found around Whangarei. Applications of organophosphates had not reduced the proportion of orchards with medium or high densities of SWS. Monthly destructive sampling of scale populations between November 1990 and February 1994 was supplemented by in situ counts of scale cohorts. Both species were univoltine, but SWS eggs hatched two months earlier than those of CWS, and development between successive instars remained two to three months ahead. The start of SWS crawler emergence varied by seven weeks between 1988 - 1993. A linear relationship between scale size and fecundity was found for both species. The variation in mean scale size amongst orchards corresponded to large differences in egg production. Survivorship curves and life tables were compared between populations with high and low levels of ladybird predation. Over 90 % of crawlers failed to settle. At four orchards with high numbers of ladybirds, 99 % of settled first and second instar scales died. The key mortality factor occurred at this stage where ladybirds were abundant. In contrast, where ladybirds were scarce, mortality of first and second instar scales was approximately 82 % and some scales survived to breed. Mortality of third instar and adult scales was approximately 80 % and 50 % respectively. Parasitised scales were incubated and parasitoids identified from emerged adults. Diseased scales were cultured to identify fungal entomopathogens. One primary and one secondary parasitoid (Euxanthellus philippiae Silvestri and Coccidoctonus dub ius (Girault) respectively) and two fungal pathogens (Verticillium lecanii (Zimmermann) Viegas and Fusarium spp.) attacked one or both of these stages of SWS and CWS. Parasitoids and pathogens each caused less than 30 % mortality. Density-dependent mortality was not shown by any of the natural enemies. The effect of ladybirds on scale populations was assessed by sampling and experiments where branches and trees were covered to exclude or include ladybirds. Ladybirds predated first and second instar scales and could reduce local scale populations to extinction. Both larval and adult steel blue ladybirds (SBL) Halmus chalybeus (Boisduval), Rhyzobius forestieri (Mulsant), and adult Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant and Rodolia cardinalis (Mulsant) fed on SWS in laboratory experiments. Adult SBL and R. forestieri consumed approximately 15 scales per day in the field. SBL comprised 98 % of ladybirds in visual and manual searches. Pesticides were screened for toxicity to SBL by a slide dip method, and for disruption to predation by the reduction in feeding on treated leaves. Fungicides and insecticides inhibited feeding by SBL and reduced their numbers. Copper-based fungicides reduced predation by about 80 % compared with approximately 30 % by non-copper fungicides. Buprofezin was non-toxic and non-disruptive to SBL. Mineral oils were moderately toxic but caused some disruption to predation. Organophosphates, synthetic pyrethroids and an insecticidal soap were highly toxic to SBL at recommended label rates. Three fungicides were evaluated in an orchard. Both copper and non-copper fungicides reduced numbers of ladybirds. Nine-spray programmes reduced numbers more than 5 -spray programmes. SWS were more abundant than CWS probably in part because their phenology made them less vulnerable to adverse environmental conditions and ladybirds. Currently, SBL are the key to biological control of SWS and CWS, but with present spray programmes particularly those involving organophosphates, ladybirds cannot be relied on to be sufficiently abundant at the right time of year to achieve control. Orchardists should avoid or reduce applications of copper fungicides during spring and summer to minimise disruption to predation of SWS by ladybirds. The introduction of parasitoids such as those which control SWS in South Mrica and Australia would complement the existing biocontrol from ladybirds and should be investigated...|$|E
