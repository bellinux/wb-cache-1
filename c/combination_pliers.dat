5000|$|The program {{currently}} comprises approximately 100 {{types of}} pliers, totalling more than 900 different variants {{in terms of}} length, shape and finish. These include commonly used types of pliers such as <b>combination</b> <b>pliers,</b> side cutters and water pump pliers {{as well as more}} specialized pliers for use in electrical and plumbing installation and electronics. The range also includes special tools for cutting, stripping and crimping including tools for applications in aerospace, solar power technology and optical fiber installation. Knipex also offers a broad program of high-voltage insulated tools. Knipex has built up a reputation of being a strong innovator in its field with products like self-locking water pump pliers ("Alligator" [...] pliers), precision push-button water pump pliers ("Cobra" [...] pliers), high-leverage mini bolt cutters ("Cobolt" [...] cutters) and parallel jaw, ratchet action wrenches ("Pliers Wrench").|$|E
50|$|Lineman's, {{linesman}}'s (US English), linesman pliers (Canadian English), <b>combination</b> <b>pliers,</b> or side-cutting pliers are {{a type of}} pliers used by electricians {{and other}} tradesmen primarily for gripping, twisting, bending and cutting wire and cable. Linemen's pliers owe their effectiveness to their plier design, which multiplies force through leverage. Lineman's pliers have a gripping joint at their snub nose and cutting edge in their craw. Some versions include either an additional gripping or crimping device at {{the crux of the}} handle side of the pliers' joint. Lineman's pliers typically are machined from forged steel and the two handles precisely joined with a heavy-duty rivet that maintains the pliers' accuracy even after repeated use under extreme force on heavy-gauge wire. Lineman's pliers usually have grips for better handling than bare metal handles; the grips may also provide insulation for protection against electric shock when working with live circuits, although most models are marked as not listed for such use. Some pliers are certified to withstand a specified voltage, e.g. 1000V.|$|E
