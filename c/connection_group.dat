The aim {{of this article was}} to evaluate, by x-ray 3 -dimensional microtomography, implant-abutment contact surfaces and microgaps at the implant-abutment interface in different types of implant-abutment connections. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 implants were used in this in vitro study. Ten implants presented a screw-retained internal hexagon abutment (group I), 10 had a Morse Cone taper internal <b>connection</b> (<b>group</b> II), 10 another type of Morse Cone taper internal <b>connection</b> (<b>group</b> III), and 10 had a screwed trilobed <b>connection</b> (<b>group</b> IV). Results: In both types of Morse Cone internal connections, there was no detectable separation at the implant-abutment {{in the area of the}} conical connection, and there was an absolute congruity without any microgaps between abutment and implant.

40|$|As {{technology}} trends push future microprocessors toward chip multiprocessor designs, {{operating system}} network stacks must be parallelized {{in order to}} keep pace with improvements in network bandwidth. There are two competing strategies for stack parallelization. Messageparallel network stacks use concurrent threads to carry out network operations on independent messages (usually packets), whereas connection-parallel stacks map operations to <b>groups</b> of <b>connections</b> and permit concurrent processing on independent <b>connection</b> <b>groups.</b> Connection-parallel stacks can use either locks or threads to serialize access to <b>connection</b> <b>groups.</b> This paper evaluates these parallel stack organizations using a modern operating system and chip multiprocessor hardware. Compared to uniprocessor kernels, all parallel stack organizations incur additional locking overhead, cache inefficiencies, and scheduling overhead. However, the organizations balance these limitations differently, leading to variations in peak performance and connection scalability. Lock-serialized connection-parallel organizations reduce the locking overhead of message-parallel organizations by using many <b>connection</b> <b>groups</b> and eliminate the expensive thread handoff mechanism of thread-serialized connection-parallel organizations. The resultant organization outperforms the others, delivering 5. 4 Gb/s of TCP throughput for most connection loads and providing a 126 % throughput improvement versus a uniprocessor for the heaviest connection loads. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} risks for wound dehiscence after guided bone regeneration (GBR) in dental implant surgery. Methods: Patients who received dental implant therapy with GBR procedure at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (Seongnam, Korea) from June 2004 to May 2007 were included. The clinical outcome of interest was complications related to dental implant surgery. The factors influencing wound dehiscence, classified into patient-related factors, surgery-related factors and material-related factors, were evaluated. Results: One hundred and fifteen cases (202 implants) were included in this study. Wound dehiscence (19. 1 %) was considered a major complication. The risk of wound dehiscence was higher in males than in females (odds ratio= 4. 279, P = 0. 014). In the main graft, the allogenic group had the lowest risk of wound dehiscence (odds ratio= 0. 106, P = 0. 006).

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} effect of the {{condition}} of the right heart after the Fontan operation on portal venous flow, and to determine whether the characteristics of portal venous flow were different when there was an atriopulmonary connection with atrial septal closure rather than an atriopulmonary or total cavopulmonary connection with intra-atrial routing. PATIENTS AND METHODS [...] After the Fontan operation six patients with an atriopulmonary <b>connection</b> (<b>group</b> 1), three patients with an atriosubpulmonary <b>connection</b> (<b>group</b> 2), four patients with intra-atrial routing and an atriopulmonary <b>connection</b> (<b>group</b> 3), and five patients with a total cavopulmonary <b>connection</b> (<b>group</b> 4) were studied by pulsed Doppler echocardiography. The flow signals were recorded for the pulmonary artery, hepatic vein, and intrahepatic portal vein in each patient. Postoperative cardiac catheterisation was performed in 16 of the 18 patients. The Doppler findings were compared with those of 14 controls. RESULTS [...] The portal flow was pulsatile in 13 patients and constant in five patients. Reversed flow was shown at or just after the QRS wave after hepatic venous regurgitation in two group 1 patients. The flow signal was interrupted in two group 1 patients and two group 2 patients. Decrease in velocity of flow was recorded in two group 1 patients, one group 2 patients, three group 3 patients, and one group 4 patient. Portal flow was constant in one group 3 patient and four group 4 patients. The pulsatility ratio ranged from - 0. 46 to 0. 49 (mean (SD), 0. 03 (0. 32)) in the patients from group 1 and 2, from 0. 41 to 0. 76 (0. 54 (0. 15)) in group 3, and from 0. 70 to 0. 80 (0. 75 (0. 04)) in group 4. The ratio in the controls ranged from 0. 29 to 0. 83 (0. 61 (0. 13)). The ratio was significantly lower in groups 1 and 2 than in group 3 (p < 0. 01), group 4 (p < 0. 01), or the controls (p < 0. 005). There {{was no significant difference in}} the ratio between group 3 and group 4 and no correlation between the pulsatility ratio and the cardiac index (r = 0. 26), mean right atrial pressure (r = 0. 25), or pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0. 17). CONCLUSION [...] The larger hepatic venous regurgitation caused by atrial contraction in patients with an atriopulmonary connection correlated with the higher portal pulsatility and a total cavopulmonary connection reduced portal pulsatility...|$|E

The null hypothesis tested was that the accuracy of implant-impressions was not affected when internal connection or external connection implants were used. Materials and Methods: Two master models were fabricated with polyurethane by duplicating an edentulous mandibular arch. In each model four implant analogs (Biomet 3 i®, Florida, USA) – internal <b>connection</b> (<b>Group</b> A) and external <b>connection</b> (<b>Group</b> B) - were placed in the intra-mental foramen region, simulating a supra osseous clinical environment and with longitudinal axis parallel to each other. The replicas were numbered anti-clockwise from 1 to 4 based on a frontal view of the master cast. For each group, reference bars machined to fit passively were fabricated using cobalt-chromium alloy. Twenty medium-consistency polyether (Impregum™ Penta™; 3 M ESPE, Germany) impressions - 10 for each group - were made using the open-tray technique. Each cast produced was assessed for accuracy by attaching the respective reference framework with a single screw on analog number 1 and measuring the vertical gap between each cylinder and the respective analog (2, 3 or 4) at four different points - buccal, lingual, distal and mesial – using a toolmakers’ microscope. Results: The results showed there were significant differences between internal and external connections, comparing measurements in all analog/point combinations. It was determined that in Group B (External connection) the vertical gaps were statistically higher than the ones verified in Group A (Internal connection). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that internal connection implants present better results on the accuracy of implant impressions comparing to external connection implants.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty implants were selected, inserted in 20 patients, 10 with a screwed implant-abutment <b>connection</b> (<b>Group</b> 1) and 10 with a cemented implant-abutment <b>connection</b> (<b>Group</b> 2). The peri-implant microflora was collected, after at least 360 days from the prosthetic rehabilitation, using paper points inserted in peri-implant sulcus for 30 s. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Real-time analyzed the presence of 9 bacteria periodontal-pathogens and Candida albicans. RESULTS: Our findings showed that bacteria colonized all Groups analyzed, the average bacterial count was 3. 7 E + 08 (± 1. 19) in Group 1, compared to 2. 1 E + 08 (± 0. 16) in Group 2; no statistically significant differences were observed (p> 0. 0. 5). In Group 1, however, bacterial colonization of peri-implant sulci was over the pathogenic threshold for 5 bacteria, indicating a high-risk of peri-implantitis. Also in Group 2, results showed a microflora composed by all bacteria analyzed but, in this case, bacterial colonization of peri-implant sulci was over the pathogenic threshold for only 1 bacterium, indicating a lower risk of peri-implantitis. Moreover, clinical parameters (PPD > 3 mm and m SBI > 0) confirmed a greater risk of peri-implantitis in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (p< 0. 05).

The aim of this in vitro study is to evaluate two different types of implant-abutment connections: the screwed <b>connection</b> (<b>Group</b> 1) and the cemented <b>connection</b> (<b>Group</b> 2), analyzing the permeability of the IAI to bacterial colonization, using human saliva as culture medium. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of twelve implants were tested, six in each experimental group. Five healthy patients were enrolled in this study. Two milliliters of non-stimulated saliva were collected from each subject and mixed in a test tube. After 14 days of incubation of the bacteria sample in the implant fixtures, a PCR-Real Time analysis was performed. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the proportions of implant-abutment assembled structures detected with bacterial leakage. Differences in the bacterial counts of the two groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. A p value < 0. 05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The results showed a decreased stability with the screwed implant-abutment connections compared to the cemented implant-abutment connections. A mean total bacterial count of 1. 2 E+ 07 (± 0. 25 E+ 07) for Group 1 and of 7. 2 E+ 04 (± 14. 4 E+ 04) for Group 2 was found, {{with a high level of}} significance, p =. 0001.

40|$|Composite beams using bolts {{to attach}} steel plates {{to the side}} faces of {{existing}} reinforced concrete (RC) coupling beams can enhance both their strength and deformability. The behavior of those composite beams differs substantially from the behavior of typical composite beams made up of steel beams and concrete slabs. The former are subjected to longitudinal, vertical and rotational slips, while the latter only involve longitudinal slip. In this study, a mixed analysis method was adopted to develop the fundamental equations for accurate prediction of the load-carrying capacity of steel plate strengthened RC coupling beams. Then, a rigid plastic analysis technique was used {{to cope with the}} full composite effect of the bolt group connections. Two theoretical models for the determination of the strength of mediumlength plate strengthened coupling beams based on mixed analysis and rigid plastic methods are presented. The strength of the strengthened coupling beams is derived. The vertical and longitudinal slips of the steel plates and the shear strength of the anchor-bolt <b>connection</b> <b>group</b> is considered. The theoretical models are validated by the available experimental results presented in a companion paper. The strength of the specimens predicted from the mixed analysis model is found to be in good agreement with that from the experimental results.

40|$|Background: Microgap {{is defined}} as the {{microscopic}} space that exists between the implant body and abutment. The main mechanism proposed for microgap-related crestal bone loss is the role of this space as a trap for bacteria and thus, as a putative etiological factor for inflammatory reaction in the peri-implant soft tissues. The aim of this paper was to evaluate, with X-ray 3 D microtomography, the microscopic space that exists between the implant body and abutment with internal hexagon versus cone morse. Methods: A total of 20 implants were used in this in vitro study. Ten implants per group were used. Ten implants presented a screw retained internal hexagon abutment (Group I) and 10 had a Cone Morse taper internal <b>connection</b> (<b>Group</b> II). Results: In both types of Cone Morse internal connection implants there was no detectable separation at the implant/abutment {{in the area of the}} conical connection, and there was an absolute congruity without any microgaps between abutment and implant.

40|$|As {{the use of}} {{large-scale}} data-driven analysis becomes increasingly common, the need for robust methods for interpreting {{a large number of}} results increases. To date, neuroimaging attempts to interpret large-scale activity or connectivity results often turn to existing neural mapping based on previous literature. In case {{of a large number of}} results, manual selection or percent of overlap with existing maps is frequently used to facilitate interpretation, often without a clear statistical justification. Such methodology holds the risk of reporting false positive results and overlooking additional results. Here, we propose using enrichment analysis for improving the interpretation {{of large-scale}} neuroimaging results. We focus on two possible cases: position group analysis, where the identified results are a set of neural positions; and <b>connection</b> <b>group</b> analysis, where the identified results are a set of neural position-pairs (i. e. neural connections). We explore different models for detecting significant overrepresentation of known functional brain annotations using simulated and real data.
