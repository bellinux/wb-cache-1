50|$|The {{primary cause}} of CFIT occurrences with no GPWS warning is landing short. When the landing gear is down and landing flaps are deployed, the GPWS expects the {{airplane}} to land and therefore, issues no warning. EGPWS introduces the Terrain <b>Clearance</b> <b>Floor</b> (TCF) function, which provides GPWS protection even in the landing configuration.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} the {{buildings}} with a high <b>clearance</b> between the <b>floor</b> and the ceiling such as airport terminals, shopping malls, atria, movie studios, theaters, convention halls, and hotel lobbies has been steadily increasing in recent years. These structures pose a unique challenge to fire safety engineers and building code officials alike because of their high <b>clearances</b> between the <b>floor</b> and the ceiling. One of the most practical yet most reliable protection schemes is installing automatic fire sprinklers on the ceiling. Two critical issues regarding the sprinkler operation at high ceiling clearance facilities are: (1) whether the sprinklers installed on such a high ceiling would operate when there is fire, and (2) what are the proper sprinkler parameters that would effectively control fire once the system activates? Utilizing the test data collected {{through a number of}} fire tests in a high ceiling clearance facility, this paper will discuss the two issues...|$|R

I have worked with Dr. Assaad and I heard him {{say that he has}} a vendetta against the U.S. government and that if anything happens to him, he told his sons to carry on." [...] According to Assaad: [...] "The letter-writer clearly knew my entire background, my training in both chemical and biological agents, my security <b>clearance,</b> what <b>floor</b> where I work now, that I have two sons, what train I take to work, and where I live." [...] Don Foster concluded it was sent by a female officer at Ft. Detrick, although he did not name Marion Rippy directly.|$|R

5000|$|The {{village of}} Barfiliya {{stood on a}} large tell, {{considered}} one potential site for ancient Be'eroth (the other possibilities being the tells of Daniyal or Simzu).

Engine finished like a show piece. There are electric lights in the quarters with two switches, louvres over the four-door windows, twin wind-tone horns, a lockable cupboard, two wipers, winding screen, and sliding roof. The Times' Motoring Correspondent continued [...] "the boot is not very large and the door does not fold down to the same level. Entrance and leg room behind are but fair, and the back seat is rather upright. On the other hand, the wheelbase of the Fifteen is not long and this body is of the sports type. There is enough head <b>clearance</b> and the <b>floors</b> are flat and unobstructed. The spare easy-clean wheel is in its own compartment. The seating is luxurious." ...|$|R
40|$|Many modern {{cars with}} rear-wheel drives have a two-piece, {{rather than the}} {{traditional}} one-piece, props haft (or tail-shaft). The two-piece shaft requires less <b>floor</b> <b>clearance,</b> and hence a smaller floor tunnel, and does not suffer from the high-speed twisting resonances to which the one-piece shaft is susceptible. The two-piece shaft is, however, susceptible to a lower speed, high load (high torque) phenomenon in which the propshaft whirls with increasing amplitude until its restraining rubber bush is fully compressed in its mounting bracket, causing a thump sound. The whirling amplitude builds up periodically, so that a regular series of thumps is heard at a frequency of about 5 per second. The effect is very sensitive to {{the properties of the}} rubber bush and to its temperature. Different designs of bush are used by different makers, each with the purpose of minimizing both the whirling problem and the transmission of other vibrations to the car body. GMH has a particular design which it would prefer not to vary, because of retooling costs. It can however vary the properties of the rubber material itself. By trial and error it has achieved rubber properties which control the whirling problem to an acceptable level under normal conditions. GMH posed the question, to the MISG, of whether one can give theoretical guidelines for optimal rubber properties. This might lead to improved control of the whirling problem. It would also be useful for new and modified propshafts, if it could replace the tedious trial and error process previously employed. GMH were also anxious {{to gain a better understanding}} of the whirling phenomenon, and felt, with us, that a mathematical description of the phenomenon was a prerequisite for the study of the rubber properties. The thumping phenomenon is observed at both 40 and 80 kph approximately, although the phenomenon had a different quality at these two speeds...|$|R

These are the biggest buildings of the premises as for the volume, which stand out for their impressing construction and their area (1493, 1 & 1486, 6 m 2). The distance between them is aprox. 125 m. The systém of construction is the same in both the buildings, it is a wooden timber reinforced brick masonry frame in modular size of 3, 6 x 6, 15 m. The constructive height of street floor of building A is 4, 4 m, building B 3, 85 m. The clearence of bulinding A is 3, 85 m and for building B 3, 27 m.

40|$|Sweden has {{a strong}} demand on the {{construction}} of student accommodations and consequently significant efforts have been taken to increase and streamline construction methods. In addition, the fluctuation on the number of students admitted at each year, in each university, lead to periods of house shortage or, in opposition to that, to eventual surplus on the housing market. For these reasons urges finding a fast execution process in construction to fulfil the market needs, together with a housing mechanism of control which balances the students' needs with the housing availability. FRAMEUP system arises thus to solve both problems by combining a modular construction with an innovative execution process. The FRAMEUP buildings uses a steel frame in combination with prefabricated 3 D modules (fully equipped and suitable for student accommodations) which are assembled by starting from the roof to the 1 st floor. The existence of a lifting system permits the erection of the building, promoting each time the building is lifted, a <b>clearance</b> of one <b>floor</b> height, at ground level, for the assembly of a new floor. The procedure is repeated several times, according to the number of floors, until the 1 st floor of the building, the last floor of the execution sequence, is assembled. Alongside with its advantage on the fast execution, the FRAMEUP system allows to efficiently increase or decrease the number of the floors and consequently its permutability with other buildings of the same nature. Thus, assuming a net of FRAMEUP buildings at each university, its permutability system would create the necessary conditions so that the number of floors at each campus would follow the fluctuations of the students' population among the different universities on different periods of time, so to suppress the needs for housing or to avoid the surplus on construction. </p...|$|R
