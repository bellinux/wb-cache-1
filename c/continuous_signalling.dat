40|$|Much of the {{literature}} on costly signalling theory concentrates on separating equilibria of <b>continuous</b> <b>signalling</b> games. At such equilibria, every signaller sends a distinct signal, and signal receivers are able to exactly infer the signaller's condition from the signal sent. In this paper, we introduce a vector-field solution method that simplifies the process of solving for separating equilibria. Using this approach, we show that <b>continuous</b> <b>signalling</b> games can have low-cost separating equilibria despite conflicting interests between signaller and receiver. We find that contrary to prior arguments, honesty does not require wasteful signals. Finally, we examine signalling games in which different signallers have different minimal-cost signals, and provide a mathematical justification for the argument that even non-signalling traits will be exaggerated beyond their phenotypic optimum when they are used by other individuals to judge condition or quality...|$|E

40|$|We showed {{previously}} that oligodendrocytes {{and their}} precursors require <b>continuous</b> <b>signalling</b> by protein trophic factors to avoid {{programmed cell death}} in culture. Here we show that three classes of such trophic factors promote oligodendrocyte survival in vitro: (1) insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), (2) neurotrophins, particularly neurotrophin- 3 (NT - 3), and (3) ciliary-neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin 6 (IL- 6). A single factor, or combinations of factors within the same class, promote only short-term survival of oligodendrocytes and their precursors, while combinations of factors from different classes promote survival additively. Long-term survival of oligodendrocytes in vitro requires at least one factor from each class, suggesting that multiple signals may be required for long-term oligodendrocyte survival in vivo. We also show that CNTF promotes oligodendrocyte survival in vivo, that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) can promote the survival of oligodendrocyte precursors in vitro by acting on a novel, very high affinity PDGF receptor, and that, {{in addition to its}} effect on survival, NT- 3 is a potent mitogen for oligodendrocyte precursor cells...|$|E
40|$|The thymus is {{a primary}} lymphoid organ that {{supports}} the production, differentiation and selection of self-tolerant T cells from immature precursors of extrathymic origin. T cell development is a dynamic process involving the movement of thymocytes through specialised regions of the thymus, each directing distinct developmental stages. The formation of these microenvironments is crucial for providing the ordered and <b>continuous</b> <b>signalling</b> required to drive the non-cell autonomous process of T cell development. The development of thymocytes and thymic epithelial cells (TEC) are interdependent processes involving reciprocal signalling termed “thymic crosstalk”. Using novel in vitro and in vivo experimental techniques we elucidated novel processes in the regulation of thymic epithelial cell development. We corroborated the importance of thymic crosstalk by revealing a new role for innate like  T cells in influencing medullary thymic epithelial cell development. Furthermore, this study argues against a specific time frame for the occurrence of thymic crosstalk by demonstrating that adult thymic epithelium retains its receptivity to lymphostromal signalling. In addition, we have recognised the importance of intrathymic niches in regulating early T cell progenitor development. Collectively these data have provided an insight into {{the development of the}} thymic epithelium and thus have important implications in relation to developing rejuvenation strategies for the atrophied thymus and following ablative therapy. ...|$|E

To further investigate how influenza virus interacts with cells in a pre-existing IFN-induced antiviral state, I have used in situ hybridization to follow the fate of input and progeny genomes in cells that have, or have not, been treated with IFN prior to infection. Here I show {{for the first time that}} IFN pre-treatment blocks the nuclear import of influenza A virus genome, which prevents the establishment of virus replication, but this can be overcome by increasing multiplicities of infection. Of those IFN-induced antiviral molecules, human MxA is an essential component of the IFN-induced antiviral state in blocking influenza virus genome import, as this block can be abolished by lentivirus-mediated knockdown of MxA. I also show that in cells constitutively expressing MxA the viral genome still manages to be transported into the nucleus, indicating that MxA might require an unidentified IFN-induced factor to block nuclear import of the influenza virus genome. These results reveal that IFN exerts its action at an early stage of virus infection by inducing MxA to interfere with the transport of viral genome into the nucleus, which is the factory for viral RNA production.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis describes a study of automatic driving in a guided transport system. Full scale practical experiments {{have been carried out}} with the co-operation of British Railways Research & Development Division. Considerable attention is paid to the problem of line capacity with a rigorous safety constraint and operational and engineering limitations. An understanding of vehicle interactions under discontinuous and <b>continuous</b> <b>signalling</b> systems is demonstrated, leading to an explanation of why the theoretical steady state plain line capacities are not realisable. This is extended to show the importance of the vehicle trajectory and how shaping the trajectory can minimise journey time, headway, energy consumption and other performance criteria, bearing in mind the inconsistency of these aims and demonstrating the trade-offs. Some theoretical work on generalised control syst'ems is described and this demonstrates the need for a greater understanding of practical engineering constraints. Consequently, available literature on train performance has been studied and experiments carried out with an instrumented train. The results indicate an inadequate understanding of train behaviour in much that has previously been pUblished. A mathematical model of the test train has been formulated {{and with the help of}} the Mathematics Applications Section of British Rail, this has been simulated on the computer. It is evident that railway braking systems partictilarly those employing cast iron friction blocks,introduce significant control problems. The control system of the train is demonstrated to be non-linear and subject to severe stochastic disturbances of both environmental and system parameters. Instrumentation of the system is difficult and the report goes to some length to identify the fundamental limitations of measurement of the principal state variables. A complete single vehicle control system has been realised on the British Rail Test Line at Mickleover. It is anticipated that an engineered system would be microprocessor based and experience has been gained with Intel devices in the communications system, whilst a mini-computer system was considered more appropriate as a test bed for control principle development. The results of the performance evaluation and control tests at Mickleover give significant insight into the likelihood of realisation of some of the theoretical ideals developed in the earlier study. The report includes details of some of the authors more recent work with Br;tish Rail on a project to implement pilot scheme automatic train operation.

40|$|Light {{essentially}} sustains {{all life}} on planet earth surface. Plants transform light energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis. Hence, {{it can be}} anticipated that extending the daily photoperiod, using artificial light, results in increased plant productivity. Although this premise is true for many plant species, a limit exists. For instance, the seminal work of Arthur et al. (1930) showed that tomato plants develop leaf injuries if exposed to continuous light (CL). Many studies have investigated the physiological mechanism inducing such CL-induced injury. Although important and valuable discoveries were done over the decades, {{by the time the}} present project started, a detailed and proven physiological explanation of this disorder was still missing. Here, I present the results of a 5 -year effort to better understand the physiological basis of the CL-induced injury in tomato and develop the tools (genetic and conceptual) to cultivate tomatoes under CL. After an exhaustive literature search, it was found that Daskaloff and Ognjanova (1965) reported that wild tomato species are tolerant to CL. Unfortunately, this important finding was ignored by numerous studies done after its publication. Here, we used the CL-tolerance found in wild tomatoes as a fundamental resource. Hence, the specific objectives of this thesis were to (i) better understand the physiological basis of the CL-induced injuries in tomato, (ii) identify the gene(s) responsible for CL-tolerance in wild tomato species, (iii) breed a CL-tolerant tomato line and (iv) use it to cultivate a greenhouse tomato crop under CL. Chapter 1 describes how innovation efforts encountered the unsolved scientific enigma of the injuries that tomato plants develop when exposed to CL. The term CL-induced injury is defined, and {{a detailed description of the}} symptoms observed in this disorder is shown. Additionally, an overview of the most important studies, influencing the hypotheses postulated and/or tested in this dissertation, is presented. Finally, a description and motivation of the main questions that this dissertation pursued to answer is presented alongside a short description of the strategy chosen to answer them. Chapter 2 reviews the literature, published over the last 80 years, on CL-induced injury using modern knowledge of plant physiology. By doing so, new hypotheses aiming to explain this disorder are postulated in addition to the ones collected from literature. Additionally, we highlight that CL is an essential tool for understanding the plant circadian clock, but using CL in research has its challenges. For instance, most of the circadian-clock-oriented experiments are performed under CL; consequently, interactions between the circadian clock and the light signalling pathway are overlooked. This chapter is published here. Chapter 3 explores the benefits and challenges of cultivating CL-tolerant tomato under CL. Considering that current commercial tomato varieties need six hours of darkness per day for optimal growth, photosynthesis does not take place during a quarter of the day. Hence, if tomatoes could be grown under CL, a substantial increase in production is anticipated. A simulation study is presented, which shows that if an ideal continuous-light-tolerant tomato genotype is used and no crop adaptations to CL are assumed, greenhouse tomato production could be 26 % higher when supplementing light to 24 h day- 1 in comparison with a photoperiod (including supplementary lighting) of only 18 h day- 1. In addition, the expected changes in greenhouse energy budgets and alterations in crop physiological responses that might arise from cultivating tomatoes under continuous light are discussed. This chapter is published here. Chapter 4 maps the locus conferring CL-tolerance in wild tomatoes to chromosome seven, and shows that its introgression into modern tomato cultivars enhances yield by 20 %, when grown under CL. In addition, genetic evidence, RNAseq data, silencing experiments and sequence analysis all point to the type III Light-Harvesting Chlorophyll a/b Binding protein 13 (CAB- 13) gene as a major factor responsible for the tolerance. In Arabidopsis thaliana this protein is thought to have a regulatory role in balancing light harvesting by photosystems I and II. The likely mechanisms that link CAB- 13 with CL-tolerance are discussed. This chapter is published here. Chapter 5 investigates from which part of the plant CL-tolerance originates and whether this trait acts systemically. By exposing grafted plants bearing both tolerant and sensitive shoots to CL, the trait was functionally located to the shoot rather than the roots. Additionally, an increase in continuous-light tolerance was observed in sensitive plants when a continuous-light-tolerant shoot was grafted on it. Our results show that in order to increase yield in greenhouse tomato production by using CL, the trait should be bred into scion rather than rootstock lines. Chapter 6 discusses the factors that differ between injurious and non-injurious light regimes. Each of these factors may potentially be responsible for triggering the injury in CL-grown tomato and was experimentally tested here. In short, these factors include (i) differences in the light spectral distribution between sunlight and artificial light, (ii) <b>continuous</b> <b>signalling</b> to the photoreceptors, (iii) constant supply of light for photosynthesis, (iv) constant photo-oxidative pressure, and (v) circadian asynchrony — a mismatch between the internal circadian clock frequency and the external light/dark cycles. The evidence presented here suggests that the continuous-light-induced injury does not result from the unnatural spectral distribution of artificial light or the continuity of the light per se. Instead, circadian asynchrony seems to be the factor inducing the injury. As the discovered diurnal fluctuations in photoinhibition sensitivity of tomato seedlings are not under circadian control, it seems that circadian asynchrony does not directly induce injury via photoinhibition as it has been proposed. Chapter 7 investigates a possible role for phytochromes (PHY) in CL-induced injury in tomato. Mutant and transgenic tomato plants lacking or over-expressing phytochromes were exposed to CL, with and without far-red light enrichment, to test the role of individual phytochromes on the induction and/or prevention of injury. PHYA over-expression confers complete tolerance to CL regardless the light spectrum. Under CL with low far-red content, PHYB 1 and PHYB 2 diminished and enhanced the injury, respectively, yet the effects were small. These results confirm that phytochrome signaling networks are involved in the injury induction under CL. The link between CAB- 13 and PHYA is discussed. Chapter 8 investigates the role of carbohydrate accumulation in the induction of CL-induced injury in tomato by using untargeted metabolomics and transcriptomics data. These data reveal a clear effect of CL on sugar metabolism and photosynthesis. A strong negative correlation between sucrose and starch with the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv /Fm) was found across several abnormal light/dark cycles, supporting the hypothesis that carbohydrates play an important role in CL-induced injury. I suggest that CL-induced injury in tomato is caused by a photosynthetic down-regulation showing characteristics of both cytokinin-regulated senescence and light-modulated retrograde signaling. Molecular mechanisms linking carbohydrate accumulation with photosynthetic down-regulation are discussed. Chapter 9 provides a synthesis of the most important findings and proposes a generic model of CL-induced injury in tomato. I propose that CL-induced injury in tomato arises from retrograde signals that counteract signals derived from the cellular developmental program that promote chloroplast development, such that chloroplast development cannot be completed, resulting in the chlorotic phenotype. Finally, perspectives on what future directions to take to further elucidate the physiological basis of this trait and successfully implement it in greenhouses are presented...|$|E
