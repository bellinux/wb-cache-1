Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the Christian Brothers O'Connell School on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered {{a place in the}} Jesuits' Dublin school, Belvedere College, in 1893. This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere. In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the Sodality of Our Lady by his peers at Belvedere. The philosophy of Thomas Aquinas continued to have a strong influence on him for most of his life.|$|E

25|$|The Lordship {{actually}} {{controlled by}} the English king shrank accordingly, and as parts of its perimeter in counties Meath and Kildare were fenced or ditched, it {{became known as the}} Pale, deriving from the Latin word palus, a stake, or, synecdochically, a fence. Parts can still be seen west of <b>Clane</b> on the grounds of what is now Clongowes Wood College. The military power of the crown itself was greatly weakened by the Hundred Years War (1337–1453), and the Wars of the Roses (1455–85). The Parliament of Ireland was created, often sitting at Drogheda until the Tudors took greater interest in Irish affairs from 1485 and moved it back to Dublin. The Pale generally consisted of fertile lowlands which were easier for the garrison to defend from ambush than hilly or wooded ground. For reasons of trade and administration, a version of English became the official language. Its closest modern derivative {{is said to be the}} accent used by natives of Fingal.|$|E

50|$|When Suncroft {{defeated}} Ardclough in the 1974 senior hurling final, 4-5 to 0- 11, {{against a}} team that had beaten them three times that season {{it was the greatest}} upset in Kildare hurling since <b>Clane's</b> defeat in 1921. Throughout its history, Suncroft had close connections with the nearby Curragh camp. It was founded by Dick Cahill and Bill Laford in 1948, and won Junior championships in 1951 and 1953 in the era of Paddy Feeley, Laford, James, Freeman, Seamus Gough, Patrick Fahy and Billy Quinn. Quinn starred on Suncroft teams that never reached a county final but beat Athy in 1962 and Éire Óg in 1963 in championship matches. The Suncroft side of the early sixties was probably its strongest, Frank Fogarty, Derry Noonan, Niall Cummins, Fintan Morrissey, George Shaughnessy, Denis Hanley and Mick Cunningham, all playing for the county, as did Noel Fahy throughout the 1950s. Suncroft defeated Broadford in the Junior final of 1973 to regain Senior status, and despite a 3-19 to 3-6 defeat by Ardclough in a championship group match, qualified for the County final. They won with a brand of hard ground hurling and by keeping Johnny Walsh scoreless from play. Frank Fogarty now 32, and Donncha O'Keeffe, now 28, survived from Kildare's 1966 junior championship team. Tommy Doyle scored two goals, Con McNamara and Eugene Sheehan a goal each as Suncroft came storming through for victory in the second half. Ardclough defeated Suncroft 7-18 to 0-7 in the 1975 final.|$|R
25|$|Hamilton Rowan {{returned}} to Ireland in his thirties, in 1784, {{to live at}} Rathcoffey near <b>Clane</b> in north County Kildare. He became a celebrity and, despite his wealth and privilege, a strong advocate for Irish liberty. He joined the Killyleagh Volunteers (a militia group later associated with radical reform) under his father's command, also in 1784. Hamilton Rowan first gained public attention by championing the cause of fourteen-year-old Mary Neal in 1788. Neal had been lured into a Dublin brothel and then assaulted by Lord Carhampton. Hamilton Rowan publicly denounced Carhampton and published a pamphlet A Brief Investigation of the Sufferings of John, Anne, and Mary Neal in the same year. An imposing figure at more than six feet tall, Hamilton Rowan's notoriety grew when he entered a Dublin dining club threatening several of Mary Neal's detractors, with his massive Newfoundland at his side, and a shillelagh in hand. The incident won him public applause and celebrity {{as a champion of}} the poor.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the article}} is an {{introduction}} of Environmental Kuznets Curve as a concept, discu- ssion of its existence arising from empirical research for different pollutants and its theoretical explanation. The article includes own EKC research result concerning particulate matter in the air. Economic growth, measured as GDP per capita in a given country, is connected with increasing pollution, but after some turning point pollution starts declining. This relationship has an inverted U-shape and is called Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). EKC was first identified in a research by Grossman and Krueger from 1991 [8], other studies came after soon. In the air pollution EKC was identified for SO 2, NO x a dark matter (smoke), in water pollution for biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, nitrates and some heavy metals (such as arsenic, cadmium or lead). EKC evidence for particulate matter (PM) is mixed, EKC wasn ́t found for CO or CO 2. However, some authors consider evidence for EKC statistically weak. Standard explanation of EKC comes from [17]: „As the development and industrailization progress, environmental damage increases due to greater use of natural resources, more emissions of pollutants, the operation of less effici- ent and relatively dirty technologies, the high priority given to increase in material output, and di- sregard for – or ignorance of – the environmental consequences of growth. However, as economic growth continues and life expectancies increase, <b>claner</b> water, improved air quality, and a generally cleaner habitat become more valuable [...] . ” EKC research has important policy implications: from some point environmental quality impro- ves with ecomic growth. Hence efforts to reduce economic growth to protect environment have in fact the opposite effect [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{cladistic}} and biogeographic {{analysis is}} presented of Heterostylum Macquart (Diptera: Bombyliidae), a New World bee-fly genus with 14 species. A phylogenetic hypothesis was obtained {{based on a}} data matrix with 27 characters, using the cladogram analysis and search program, TNT, and the matrix editing and tree viewing program, WINCLADA. Character states were polarized by tree rooting with the following outgroup taxa: Toxophora aurea Macquart, Apiformyia australis Yeates, Triploechus novus Williston, T. bellus Philippi, and T. heteronevrus Macquart. The monophyly of Heterostylum was well supported, and after successive weighting was applied, 2 major clades were found: a Nearctic clade including H. robustum (Osten Sacken), H. helvolum Hall & Evenhuis, H. deani Painter, H. croceum Painter, and H. engelhardti Painter, and a Neotropical clade with H. haemorrhoicum (Loew), H. rufum (Olivier), H. evenhuisi Cunha & Lamas, H. maculipennis Cunha & Lamas, H. ferrugineum (Fabricius), H. hirsutum (Thunberg), and H. pallipes Bigot. For the biogeographic analysis we derived an area cladogram based on the phylogenetic hypothesis obtained to analyze the distributional pattern and spatial diversification of Heterostylum. The divergence between Nearctic and Neotropical clades {{is associated with a}} spatial disjunction along the Mexican Transition Zone, which supports evidence that an ancient Caribbean event was mainly responsible for the diversification of major lineages of Heterostylum. This biogeographic scenario, as well as alternative scenarios, was also analyzed and discussed along with the results obtained from an event-based biogeographical analysis (DIVA). Se presenta un análisis cladístico y biogeográfico del género Heterostylum Macquart (Diptera: Bombyliidae), un género de mosca-abeja del Nuevo Mundo con 14 especies. Se obtuvo una hipótesis filogenética basado sobre una matriz de datos con 27 caracteres, utilizando el análisis de cladograma y un programa de búsqueda, TNT, y el programa de edición de matriz y de visualizar el árbol, WINCLADA. Los estados de los carácteres fueron polarizados por el árbol de enraizamiento con el siguiente taxa del grupo externo: Toxophora aurea Macquart, Apiformyia australis Yeates, Triploechus novus Williston, T. bellus Filipos y T. heteronevrus Macquart. La monofilia de Heterostylum fue bien apoyado, y después de aplicar parcialidad sucesiva, se encontraron 2 clados principales: el clan Neártica que incluye H. robustum (Osten Sacken), H. helvolum Hall & Evenhuis, H. deani Painter, H. croceum Painter, y H. engelhardti Painter, y el clados Neotropical con H. haemorrhoicum (Loew), H. rufum (Olivier), H. evenhuisi Cunha y Lamas, H. maculipennis Cunha y Lamas, H. ferrugineum (Fabricius), H. hirsutum (Thunberg), y H. pallipes Bigot. Para el análisis biogeográfico derivamos un cladograma de área basada en la hipótesis filogenética obtenida al analizar el patrón de distribución y la diversificación espacial de Heterostylum. La divergencia entre los <b>clanes</b> del Neártico y Neotropico se asocia con una disyunción espacial por la Zona de Transición Mexicana, que apoya la evidencia de que un evento antiguo del Caribe fue responsable principalmente por la diversificación de los principales linajes de Heterostylum. Este escenario biogeográfico, así como los escenarios alternativos, también fueron analizados y discutidos junto con los resultados obtenidos de un análisis biogeográfico basado en eventos (DIVA).

Its battlemented keep is a {{prominent}} landmark on the Celbridge to <b>Clane</b> road, [...] at its greatest height with walls {{four and a}} half feet thick, two small towers, a 53 step staircase and some evidence of damage in the war of 1641. Originally built by Nicholas Barby in the 13th century, it passed to the Penkistons in the 14th century, Suttons in the 15th century, the Gaynors who built the Elizabethan House in the 16th century, to Katherine Dillon and Lord Kingston in the 17th century, Bartholomew Van Homrigh, in the 18th century and Hugh Barton who built the castle roof and added the Victorian House in the 19th century.

2500|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} after the Norman Settlement was constructed the barrier, known as the [...] "Pale," [...] separating the lands occupied by the settlers from those remaining {{in the hands of}} the Irish. This barrier consisted of a ditch, raised some ten or twelve feet from the ground, with a hedge of thorn on the outer side. It was constructed, not so much to keep out the Irish, as to form an obstacle in their way in their raids on the cattle of the settlers, and thus give time for a rescue. The Pale began at Dalkey, and followed a southwesterly direction towards Kilternan; then turning northwards passed Kilgobbin, where a castle still stands, and crossed the Parish of Taney to the south of that part of the lands of Balally now called Moreen, and thence in a westerly direction to Tallaght, and on to Naas in the County of Kildare. In the wall bounding Moreen is still to be seen a small watch-tower and the remains of a guard-house adjoining it. From this point a beacon-fire would raise the alarm as far as Tallaght, where an important castle stood. A portion of the Pale is still to be seen in Kildare between <b>Clane</b> and Clongowes Wood College at Sallins.|$|E
