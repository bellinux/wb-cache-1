50|$|The next {{challenge}} {{featured the}} trucks, speed limiters removed, {{in a race}} around the two-mile bowl of Millbrook to see which was fastest; Hammond won with his lightweight ERF hitting 90 miles an hour. The fourth test had each presenter attempting to perform a hill start with their vehicles, and to encourage them, prized possessions were placed behind each of their lorries. Jeremy, with his drum kit placed behind his lorry, was successful as his vehicle had a <b>crawler</b> <b>gear,</b> although May and Hammond promptly ran over and trashed the drum kit. Oliver, Hammond's restored Opel Kadett from the Botswana adventure, was placed behind his lorry and he eventually forfeited rather than risk crushing it. May's grand piano was smashed when he failed to prevent his lorry from rolling backwards, although the production crew had already damaged it while positioning it.|$|E
50|$|The Unimog 435 is {{the first}} heavy duty Unimog series which has an ″edgy″ cab. It is {{designed}} as a 7,5-ton truck. Like other Unimogs it has a ladder frame, portal axles and screw springs. The Unimog 435 was built with two different wheelbases, 3.250 mm and 3.850 mm. It is a rear wheel drive vehicle with switchable all wheel drive. The gearbox is a fully synchronized 8-speed manual gearbox with lockable differentials. A reduction gear and a <b>crawler</b> <b>gear</b> were available as additional accessory. Depending on the built in gear box and portal axle final drive ratio the top speed is between 80 and 110 km/h. The brake system uses compressed air to activate the dual hydraulic circuit disk brakes. A compressed air trailer brake system was an additional accessory. An engine brake was available as well. The Unimog 435 uses hydraulic power steering. The engines in the Unimog 435 are naturally aspirated or turbocharged Mercedes-Benz OM 353 series engines. Starting in 1987 Mercedes-Benz used the OM 366 engine instead.|$|E
50|$|The tractor {{is built}} using a {{frameless}} block construction. The rear axle is a portal axle, the front axle is a swing axle. The wheelbase is 1668 mm. The {{track of the}} front wheels can be increased by turning the rims on the vertical axis. The internal expanding brake brakes the back wheels only. It can also act as a steering brake. The steering gear and the gearbox were produced by ZF Friedrichshafen. All Porsche-Diesel 218 tractors have a six gear gearbox with a <b>crawler</b> <b>gear.</b> The clutch is the single-disk dry clutch K 200 Z by Fichtel & Sachs. It operates with an oil hydraulic clutch by Voith. The exception is the Standard V 218, which has a five gear gearbox only. It also lacks the oil hydraulic clutch. Porsche-Diesel offered a Three-point linkage as an optional equipment. It can lift up to 550 kg The second optional equipment is a mowing bar. It was offered for DM 500. The weight of the tractor is 1625 kg including the three-point-linkage, the mower bar and the extra weights. The maximum weight allowed is 2300kg. The paint is RAL 3002 Karminrot for the body and RAL 1014 or 1015 Elfenbein for the rims. The Standard 218 doesn't have a fuel tap due to tightness problems.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} gearbox {{was also}} available {{with an additional}} intermediate gearbox. The intermediate gearbox simply doubles the amount of gears, resulting in 2 × 6 forward and 2 × 2 reverse gears. Its gear lever has the three positions ″main gearbox″, ″intermediate gearbox″ and neutral. In addition to the additional intermediate gearbox, Daimler-Benz also offered a crawler-gearbox. The crawler-gearbox {{can be used with}} the first and second gear of every group of the main gearbox, it has two <b>crawler</b> <b>gears,</b> ″crawler″ and ″super crawler″, a neutral position and a ″main gearbox″ position. When in main gearbox position, all main gearbox gears can be used. This results in 2 × 6 + 2 × 4 forward and 2 × 2 + 2 × 2 reverse gears.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{technical}} level, perforation efficiency and ability of LWD- 200 B full hydraulic open cut mine drill {{to adapt to the}} complex geological conditions, we developed LWD- 200 B multi-function full hydraulic open cut mine drill, the drill has rotary cutting, impact and roller bit drill three functions. The drill travel use hydraulic motor to drive <b>crawler</b> belt running <b>gear,</b> low speed high torque hydraulic motor to direct top drive drilling rod. Pressure and lifting system use a long stroke hydraulic cylinder, wire rope and pulley mechanism, load sensing constant power variable pump, load sensing electromagnetic proportional multi-way directional valve. The control system uses electronic control handle and PLC controller, design pressure, speed, length, temperature sensors etc. and GPS base station, with real-time data acquisition, display, lithology automatic identification, closed-loop feedback control, GPS precise positioning, the manual and automatic drilling, specified depth or level drilling function. It applies to drilling diameter 150 mm ~ 200 mm blast hole in various types of open pit mine...|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} a set of stands made in NIMK TSAGI for testing and {{creating}} the air cushion chassis for the aircraft and vehicles. It allows to fully embrace the process of developing and constructing the air cushion chassis for air- craft and solve problems relating to peculiarities of such aircraft on the takeoff, landing and movement in the elementary prepared and unprepared soil runways, flat terrain and water areas. The complex includes: the experimental installation to study aeroelasticity phenomena of the chassis in the extending and retracting process with simulation of aircraft and ekran- oplane takeoff and landing modes in the air flow, including the wind tunnels; the experimental stand with vertical screen for testing of ekranoplane models in T- 5 wind tunnel of NIMC TsAGI, permitting to simultaneously vary the model’s posi- tion relatively to the screen, roll, pitch (angle of attack), and banking; mobile experimental stand with contact <b>crawler</b> <b>gear,</b> for experimental determination and comparative evaluation of the chassis with different patterns of formation and air cush- ion fences for all-year-round testing in natural conditions at elementary-prepared and unprepared sites and water areas. Based on mathematical simulation of flow past in the wind tunnel the possibility of use booth stand with vertical screen and experimental installation to study aeroelasticity phenomena of the chassis for experimental studies, respectively, by defini- tion of the aerodynamic characteristics of forces and moments of the air cushion aircraft and ekranoplanes models and the research of phenomena of aeroelasticity of flexible fencing is substantiated...|$|E
