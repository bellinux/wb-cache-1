5|$|The {{perpetrators}} were apprehended in 1989 {{under the}} administration of President <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gortari.</b> Moro and Zorrilla were sentenced to 25 and 35 years in prison respectively, but were released from prison in February 2009 for good conduct after serving {{at least half of}} their sentences. Several public intellectuals, journalists, press freedom organizations, newspapers, and politicians protested their releases. Zorrilla returned to prison later that year after he failed to provide a formal letter petitioning his release. On 10 September 2013, Zorrilla was released from prison after a Mexico City judge granted him the opportunity to fulfill the remaining years of his sentence at his residence due to unstable health conditions. The Mexican government closed the case after the arrests, but many journalists doubted the results of the investigation and believed that the masterminds behind the murder case remained at large.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, the nuevo peso (new peso) was {{the result}} of {{hyperinflation}} in Mexico. In 1993, President <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gortari</b> stripped three zeros from the peso, creating a parity of $1 New Peso for $1000 of the old ones.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gortari</b> {{proposed}} a smaller but still monumental hydro project in 1990, and completed the periferico surrounding the Montes Azules reserve.

50|$|With President <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gortari's</b> {{economic}} and political reforms, the NAFTA agreement, Mexico was getting propelled as an important {{player in the world}} economy. When an unsolved ethnic situation was brewing in the Mexican county, that is when the Zapatistas uprising happened. The Mexican Government started immediate peace talks. In {{the early days of the}} new government administration, President Zedillo took a series of erratic decisions that completely broke with the previous administration's agreements and with his own action plan previously defined.|$|R
25|$|In the 1980s {{the first}} cracks emerged in PRI's monopolistic position. In Baja California, Ernesto Ruffo Appel was elected as governor. In 1988, alleged electoral fraud {{prevented}} the leftist candidate Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas from winning the national presidential elections, giving <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gortari</b> {{the presidency and}} leading to massive protests in Mexico City.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} reforms of President <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gortari</b> {{had a tremendous}} effect on the city, {{as a number of}} businesses, including banks and airlines, were privatized. He also signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This led to decentralization and a shift in Mexico City's economic base, from manufacturing to services, as most factories moved away to either the State of Mexico, or more commonly to the northern border. By contrast, corporate office buildings set their base in the city.|$|E
25|$|DN1: Preparation of the {{military}} forces to repel external aggressions. No military armed force can leave Mexican territory without a declaration of war, and approval of the Congress. The last time this was invoked was in 1942, to send an expeditionary force to the Philippines, after war was declared against Germany and Japan, following the sinking of two Mexican ships by U-boats. In 1990, President <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gortari</b> asked {{the permission of the}} Congress to send troops to the Gulf War, but it was refused, since there was no declaration of war against Iraq.|$|E
5000|$|Following President <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gortari's</b> {{economic}} and political reforms, including NAFTA, Mexico was becoming an important {{player in the world}} economy. In 1995, the Zapatistas began a rebellion against the government. The Salinas government started immediate peace talks. In the last months of the Salinas administration, a wave of politically-motivated assassinations took place in Mexico. Victims included Cardenal Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo, front runner presidential candidate Colosio whom Zedillo replaced as the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate, José Francisco Ruiz Massieu, brother-in-law of President Salinas and PRI Secretary General.|$|R
2500|$|When the Gulf Cartel {{was moving}} tons of cocaine to the United States and moving {{millions}} of dollars in cash along the border in the 1970s, Juan García Ábrego decided that he needed more protection. Court documents indicated that García Ábrego was bribing several law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and politicians on both sides on the border to keep himself impune and untouched. His former friends and associates mentioned that the drug lord was paying one of <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gortari's</b> deputy attorneys general more than $1.5 million a month for his protection. He is allegedly reported to have been protected by a large private army of gunmen. A retired FBI agent and expert in drug trafficking explained that the Gulf Cartel [...] "relied on bribery" [...] to build its drug empire and consolidate its prominence.|$|R
40|$|Mexican President <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gortari’s</b> {{overhaul}} of the national education system in the early 1990 ’s offers {{an example of how}} neoliberal governments have reworked education systems and curriculum to fit neoliberal economic models. Part of the goal of this overhaul was to reconstruct a national identity that would support the development of neoliberalism in Mexico, where the post-Revolutionary national values ran contrary to those of neoliberal capitalism. This thesis explores the reconstruction of national identity through the use of educational policy in Mexico to rewrite historical narratives to promote the government’s neoliberal agenda. It examines the changes implemented in educational policies to understand the fundamental shift in the government’s approach to education and in the neoliberal agenda directing that approach. Next, it analyzes the historical narratives presented in one state-sponsored primary history textbook to investigate how the historical narrative is revised. The findings suggest that the new educational policies apply a neoliberal framework to the public education system, and that reframed historical narratives are designed to highlight capitalist values, such as individualism, Western notions of modernity, and the maintenance of social order, while downplaying and criticizing revolutionary nationalism...|$|R
25|$|Velázquez {{was also}} a {{faithful}} supporter of the technocrat current within the PRI, which sought to dismantle the nationalist economic policies of the Mexican Revolution in order to open México to foreign investment. Velázquez supported technocrat Presidents Miguel de la Madrid, <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gortari,</b> and Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon as they privatized state-owned enterprises (formerly a bastion of power for the CTM) {{as part of the}} structural adjustment plans imposed by the International Monetary Fund. During those years the minimum wage in real terms fell by nearly 70 percent. Velázquez also supported passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 after initially denouncing it as a disaster for workers of all three countries.|$|E
25|$|Canada's Brian Mulroney {{not only}} ran {{on a similar}} {{platform}} but also favored closer trade ties with the United States. This led to the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement in January 1989. Mexican presidents Miguel de la Madrid, in the early 1980s and <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gortari</b> in the late 1980s, started implementing liberal economic strategies that were seen as a good move. However, Mexico experienced a strong economic recession in 1982 and the Mexican peso suffered a devaluation. In the United States president Ronald Reagan attempted to move the United States back towards a hard anti-communist line in foreign affairs, in what his supporters saw {{as an attempt to}} assert moral leadership (compared to the Soviet Union) in the world community. Domestically, Reagan attempted to bring in a package of privatization and regulation to stimulate the economy.|$|E
25|$|He {{became a}} member of the Democratic {{leadership}} as a deputy majority whip, where he became friends with Bill Clinton after they worked closely on several issues, including when he served as the ranking House Democrat in favor of NAFTA's passage in 1993. For his work as a back channel to <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gortari,</b> Mexico's president at the time of the negotiations, he was awarded the Aztec Eagle Award, Mexico's highest award for a foreigner. Clinton in turn sent Richardson on various foreign policy missions, including a trip in 1996 in which Richardson traveled to Baghdad with Peter Bourne and engaged in lengthy one-on-one negotiations with Saddam Hussein to secure the release of two American aerospace workers who had been captured by the Iraqis after wandering over the Kuwaiti border. Richardson also visited Nicaragua, Guatemala, Cuba, Peru, India, North Korea, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Sudan to represent U.S. interests and met with Slobodan Milošević. In 1996 he played a major role in securing the release of American Evan Hunziker from North Korean custody and for securing a pardon for Eliadah McCord, an American convicted and imprisoned in Bangladesh. Due to these missions, Richardson was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times.|$|E
40|$|January 2004 {{marked the}} tenth {{anniversary of the}} {{uprising}} of the Ejercito Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (EZLN) in the Mexican state of Chiapas. Proclaiming {{the need for a}} global campaign against neoliberalism, and rapidly repudiating the charge that its intellectual authors were foreigners, the EZLN rebellion brought together an already organized indigenous grassroots leadership and leftist insurgents whose outlooks were transformed by their experience in the Selva Lacandona. The global impact of the movement was undeniable. For a new generation of anti-globalization activists in Europe and North America, the new Zapatismo suggested “a new way to do politics”. In the words of one European solidarity activist, it “created a new language that knows how to say this world is shit, but knows how to say it with humor, joy, candor, without authoritarianism ” (Hernández, 2004 : 4). 2 Its national impact was also significant, not only because the rebellion reanimated a broader range of movements opposed to the neoliberal turn of the Mexican State, but also because a meeting of the Commission on the Application of the Norms of the International Labour Organization, meeting in June 1995, declared Mexico to be violating international standards with regard to the rights of rural workers and indigenous peoples and called for a rectification of the country’s indigenous policy (ibid. : 2). Nevertheless, ten years on the continuing significance of the Zapatista movement needs to be debated. The low-intensity war that followed the failure of <b>Carlos</b> <b>Salinas</b> <b>de</b> <b>Gortari’s</b> initial efforts to annihilate the EZLN made a clear contribution to a sapping of its grassroots support in Chiapas outside the inner core of the insurgen...|$|R

500|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, troops were called in to deliver aid to the victims of the storm. A state of emergency was declared in at least ten states in Mexico following Calvin's passage. Furthermore, Mexican officials implemented emergency measures with assistance of agencies such as the Mexican Army and the local health department in the most of the devastated areas. Civil protection authorities donated food to more than 40,000people for three days. They distributed around 11,000blankets, 5,000mattresses, 8,000sacks of sand to reinforce dikes, and an additional [...] of food, medicine, and clothes. Many Los Angeles residents looked for ways to donate aid to the needy.
