25|$|<b>Chief</b> <b>economist</b> <b>for</b> Japan at Credit Suisse, Hiromichi Shirakawa, {{said in a}} note {{to clients}} that the {{estimated}} economic loss may be around $171 billion–$183billion just to the region hit by the quake and tsunami. On 14 March, the Bank of Japan, {{in an attempt to}} maintain market stability, injected 15trillion yen into the money markets to assure financial stability amid a plunge in stocks and surge in credit risk. After it set up an emergency task force to ensure liquidity {{in the aftermath of the}} disaster, governor Masaaki Shirakawa and the bank's board also enlarged a programme to buy government bonds to exchange-traded funds to the tune of 10trillion yen. The BOJ chief told reporters cash injections will continue as needed. However, following the further nuclear leaks, its actions were read by the market as insufficient despite 8trillion yen being pumped into the market. On 15 March, the Topix index fell again marking a two-day plunge not seen since 1987 as Japan's default risk surged after Prime Minister Naoto Kan warned of further leaks from the damaged nuclear power plant. Commodities were also significantly lower. Residents of Tokyo were reported to have gone on panic shopping sprees as daily necessities were sought after and gasoline was stocked up with the increasing risk of radioactivity releases.|$|E
