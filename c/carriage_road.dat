5|$|The {{educational}} and economic {{progress of the}} city began with the Company's military successes in the Deccan. The Wellington Pier (Apollo Bunder) {{in the north of}} Colaba was opened for passenger traffic in 1819 and the Elphinstone High School was established in 1822. Bombay was hit by a drought in 1824. The construction of the new mint commenced in 1825. With the construction of a good <b>carriage</b> <b>road</b> up the Bhor Ghat during the regimes of Mountstuart Elphinstone and Sir John Malcolm gave better access from Bombay to the Deccan. This road, which was opened on 10 November 1830, facilitated trade in a large measure. By 1830, regular communication with England started by steamers navigating the Red and Mediterranean Sea. In July 1832, the Parsi riots took place in consequence of a Government order for the destruction of pariah dogs which infested the city. The Asiatic Society of Bombay (Town Hall) was completed in 1833, and the Elphinstone College was built in 1835. In 1836, the Chamber of Commerce was established.|$|E

25|$|By 1867 the Warwick Argus {{reports that}} the Recreation Square {{presents}} a very neat appearance, having been surrounded by a wire fence. A description in this report indicates that the square is in two sections, that {{to the north and}} south of Albert Street, which is described as a <b>carriage</b> <b>road,</b> and that these two sections are surrounded by the timber and iron fences with entrances at each corner of both sections. From the report it is understood that the square was set aside for healthy and invigorating recreation, and that the provision of such a reserve would ensure the development of Warwick as a desirable and fashionable resort.|$|E
25|$|Originally Bémaho/Hell-Bourg {{was founded}} {{as a small}} but prosperous spa town, and prospered as such for most of a century after the 1830 European {{discovery}} of a hot spring near the future village. Contrary to many accounts of the time, this spring had obviously been known to both slaves and other locals for some time, and one colonial administrator remarked {{that it would be}} difficult to transform the area into an official bona-fide spa if slaves afflicted with leprosy and ulcers were using it. However, the eventual transformation was not to be stopped, especially after construction of a hotel was ordered by colonial authorities in 1839, and a military hospital associated with the spring finished in 1857. A <b>carriage</b> <b>road</b> finally reached the village in 1890.|$|E
50|$|The {{network of}} <b>carriage</b> <b>roads</b> {{is open to}} the public for non-motorized uses in the summer, {{including}} walking and bicycling. In the winter, most of the network is open to cross-country skiing, and a portion of it is open to snowmobiling.|$|R
5000|$|From 1915 to 1933, {{the wealthy}} philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, Jr. financed, designed, and {{directed}} {{the construction of a}} network of carriage trails throughout the park. He sponsored the landscape architect Beatrix Farrand, with the nearby family summer home Reef Point Estate, to design the planting plans for the subtle <b>carriage</b> <b>roads</b> at the park (c. 1930). The network encompassed over 50 mi of gravel carriage trails, 17 granite bridges, and two gate lodges, almost all of which are still maintained and in use today. Cut granite stones placed along the edges of the <b>carriage</b> <b>roads</b> act as guard rails of sort and are locally known as [...] "coping stones" [...] to help visitors cope with the steep edges. They are also known as [...] "Rockefeller's Teeth".|$|R

2500|$|The East Grinstead, Groombridge and Tunbridge Wells Railway (EGGTW) was {{incorporated}} by the 1862 Act and its first directors were the Earl de la Warr, his son Lord West, C.B. and John Pryce.

The company's capital was £75,000 divided into 7,500 shares and when all these shares had been subscribed for, the company was authorised to borrow up to £25,000.

[...] In addition, it was required to cross a private <b>carriage</b> <b>road</b> to Ashdown House via a bridge under the road and not a level crossing.

2500|$|... "Dolobran. [...] The country-seat of Clement A. Griscom, Esq., is a {{about half}} a mile {{northeast}} from Haverford Station, Pennsylvania Railroad, and comprises somewhat more than eighty acres, of a rolling, uneven nature, the larger portion of the land sloping generally toward the northward, and eastward to a stream of water which flows through the tract in an easterly direction. The tract is nearly rectangular in shape. The southwestern portion is gently rolling, and has been appropriated for a lawn, through which the <b>carriage</b> <b>road</b> winds to the residence past beds of beautiful variegated plants and flowers, clumps of evergreens, etc. Close by the residence is the upper end of a heavily wooded ravine, extending to the stream of water; a woodland walk has been made in this ravine, which is so closed in by trees and shrubbery that one could easily imagine himself following a path in the forest; here and there along this walk are rustic benches and 'crow-nests' for those who would rest a while. At the bottom of this walk we come out to the stream near a large lake, where there are facilities for boating and bathing. Near the head of the ravine just described, and near the mansion house is a flower garden devoted exclusively to Japanese plants. The northerly portion of the estate is naturally much rougher, and splendidly adapted by nature to the purpose to which Mr. Griscom has devoted about thirty acres of this section, namely, as an 'American Wild Garden.' Besides being originally heavily wooded, innumerable native American trees, plants, and flowers were brought from all sections of the country. Two or three old stone quarries in this tract have been utilized to make forest pools, in which are many varieties of beautiful water lilies and other water-growing flowers and plants; while rhododendrons and ferns abound along the shores of the pools and on the outcropping ledges of the cliffs. Throughout this tract woodland paths wind in every direction, along which the pedestrian can catch a glimpse of shaded pools, wooded glens, and nooks, mossy banks of rivulets, and such pretty bits of nature, and the paths are of a length that traversing all of them without going along the same one twice makes one feel that he had had plenty of exercise for the time. From the porch of the house one might imagine that the residence was the only building on the property, so thoroughly do the near-by tree growths hide the usual buildings of a country place, but it is only a walk of a minute or two through the trees to a finely-appointed stable, in which is kept a number of blooded horses for riding and driving, and not far off is a large greenhouse for the growth of many kinds of flowers, and hotbeds for early vegetable delicacies for the table. On {{the eastern edge of the}} estate is an attractive cottage occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Bettle, Mrs. Bettle being Mrs. Griscom's daughter; and at the foot of the lawn sloping to the eastward from the mansion house is another cottage in which reside Mr. Griscom's son, Rodman E. Griscom, and his wife." ...|$|E
