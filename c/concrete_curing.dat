50|$|Crystalline {{technology}} {{is used to}} create hydrophobic concrete by causing crystal structures to form in the tiny capillaries, pores and other air pockets {{left behind in the}} <b>concrete</b> <b>curing</b> process. During this formation, by-products are left behind in the capillaries and pores of the freshly cured concrete, typically calcium hydroxide, sulfates, sodium carbonates, potassium, calcium, and hydrated and unhydrated cement particles. These crystal structures then plug the pores and capillaries, preventing water from flowing through them. Once the crystalline chemicals are added to the concrete mixture, through either an admixture or coating, they react with the by-products in the presence of water. This reaction then forms an insoluble crystal structure that clogs the pores. This process continues until all the chemicals have reacted. When applied as a coating, the chemical reaction proceeds through the process of chemical diffusion. This is a process of a high chemical density solution migrating towards the low density chemical solution until the two come into equilibrium. Soaking the concrete in water creates a low chemical density in the pores, and applying the crystalline chemical as a coating then creates a high chemical density. These two fluids diffuse through the inner structure of the concrete until they reach equilibrium throughout the inner structure. When this process is finished, the hydrophobic concrete's crystal structure is complete.|$|E

50|$|A {{concrete}} ramp {{should follow}} the natural {{profile of the}} beach {{to prevent it from}} changing the normal flow of waves, longshore currents, water and wind. A ramp that is below the beach profile will tend to become buried and cease to provide a good surface for vehicular traffic. A ramp or stair that protrudes above the beach profile will tend to disrupt longshore currents creating deposits in front of the ramp, and scouring behind. Concrete ramps are the most expensive vehicular beach accesses to construct requiring use of a quick drying concrete or a coffer dam to protect them from tidal water during the <b>concrete</b> <b>curing</b> process. Concrete is favored where traffic flows are heavy and access is required by vehicles that are not adapted to soft sand (e.g. road registered passenger vehicles and boat trailers). Concrete stairs are commonly favored on beaches adjacent to population centers where beach users may arrive on the beach in street shoes, or where the foreshore roadway is substantially higher than the beach head and a ramp would be too steep for safe use by pedestrians. A composite stair ramp may incorporate a central or side stair with one or more ramps allowing pedestrians to lead buggies or small boat dollies onto the beach without the aid of a powered vehicle or winch. Concrete ramps and steps should be maintained to prevent buildup of moss or algae that may make their wet surfaces slippery and dangerous to pedestrians and vehicles.|$|E

40|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted that high curing temperature (near 60 °C or above) results in reduced mechanical properties and durability of concrete compared to normal curing temperature.

The efficiency of curing methods was measured in terms of concrete compressive strength at 28 days. The methods were water sprinkling two times a day for seven days, which is designated as SWC; and water sprinkling two times a day for seven days with a burlap cover, which is designated as SBC. The specimens were tested at 28 days and compared with standard cured specimens, which were designated as STD. A total of 56 cube specimens were collected from construction sites in Riyadh during the sampling period and cured under STD-, SWC-, and SBC- conditions. The ratios of SWC and SBC to STD strengths were plotted on normal probability forms. The mean values of these ratios were 0. 84 and 0. 93, respectively.
