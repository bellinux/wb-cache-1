40|$|AbstractSports balls such as {{softballs}} and baseballs {{are made}} from materials that are natural (<b>cork,</b> <b>wool,</b> leather) and synthetic (rubber, polyurethane) and are sensitive to moisture and temperature. It is common practice, for instance, for major league baseball parks in dry climates to condition their baseballs at 50 % relative humidity. Baseball and softball are played at temperatures ranging from less than 4 C (40 F) to more than 38 C (100 F). Standardized ball tests require controlled temperature and humidity test environments. Little information is available, however, to quantity the effect of temperature and humidity on a ball's response. The following describes test procedures used to condition softballs and baseballs to controlled levels of humidity and temperature and their effect on the ball's stiffness and elasticity. While {{the construction of the}} baseballs and softballs are quite different, their elasticity and stiffness show a similar trend with temperature and humidity. Their combined effect was shown to lower bat performance as both temperature and humidity were increased...|$|E

(i) Two texture datasets: {{the first}} one is Brodatz 32 [33] that is a {{standard}} dataset for texture recognition, and the second one is KTH-TIPS 2 a [34], a dataset for material categorization [35]. In Brodatz 32 dataset, three additional images are generated by (i) rotating, (ii) scaling, and (iii) both rotating and scaling an original sample. We use the standard protocol [36], of randomly splitting the dataset into two halves for training and testing and report average performance over 10 random splits. KTH-TIPS 2 a dataset contains 11 materials, e.g., <b>cork,</b> <b>wool,</b> linen, with images of four physical, planar samples for each material. The samples were photographed at nine scales, three poses, and four different illumination conditions. It consists of 4395 images, most of which have the size of 200 × 200. All these variations on scale pose and illumination make it an extremely challenging dataset. For KTH-TIPS 2 a texture dataset, we use the same evaluation protocol [36, 37] and report the average performance over four runs, where every time all images of one sample are taken for a test while the images of the remaining three samples are used for training.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the ability of the four porous materials: birch bark, <b>cork,</b> glass <b>wool,</b> and polyurethane foam to reduce the mineral oil index and the concentration of n-alkanes C 7 H 16 -C 38 H 78 as well as to select the most efficient materials. Model solutions of gasoline, diesel oil, and distilled water with the following values of mineral oil index were prepared to tests: 52 μg/dm 3, 68 μg/dm 3 and 73 μg/dm 3. Then, studies were carried out using a dynamic method, wherein the columns were filled with adsorbents tested, and in each of three testing series, 500 mL of the model solution at constant bed load of 1, 0551 m 3 /m 2 h was filtered through the column. After filtration, the collected sample had volume of 250 mL. The collected samples were subject to determination of mineral oil index and concentrations of n-alkanes from C 7 H 16 to C 38 H 78. Studies have shown that the most effective materials to lower the mineral oil index and the concentrations of n-alkanes in water are birch bark and glass wool...|$|R
5|$|LCA is {{used for}} example in the {{building}} sector. Buildings today account for the 40% of the world’s energy use. The resulting carbon emissions are substantially {{higher than those of}} the transportation sector. New buildings using more energy than necessary are being built every day, and millions of today's inefficient buildings will remain standing until at least 2050. It’s therefore necessary to start reducing energy use in new and existing buildings {{in order to reduce the}} planet's energy-related carbon footprint. Growing interest, space, and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building. Mineral, vegetable, or animal materials such as perlite, vermiculite, rock <b>wool,</b> glass <b>wool,</b> <b>cork,</b> plant fibers (cotton, flax, hemp, coconut), wood fiber, cellulose, and sheep's wool can be used for the production of insulation panels.|$|R
40|$|The {{insulation}} has {{an important}} role in the thermal and acoustic applications in particular in theproduction of cold. Also within the framework of this study, we studied the sawdust and wool of kapok in orderto determine insulator best adapted to the manufacture of the cold rooms or the isothermal vats. The syntheticinsulators (polyurethane, polystyrene, glass wool or rock) are very effective, but their use especially burdensthe price with the systems carried out until now in the countries of the south. The characterization of localmaterials, vegetable origin for a possible substitution in the systems and the achievements w hich call upon theinsulation, should make it possible to save energy in the building, heatings water, the cold rooms and topreserve perishable goods (food, drugs, vaccines…). This study enables us to conclude that one canadvantageously use wool of kapok or kapok in the place of heat insulators such as the polyurethane,polystyrene, glass <b>wool</b> or <b>cork.</b> However the <b>wool</b> of kapok compared has a better conductivity to the saw dust...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} {{building}} {{experience of the}} very technologically advanced part of the planet, concept of Sustainability, has brought to more suitable solutions based on LCA managing models, from material and component dimension to the accomplished built object. Nowadays, buildings and dwellings have become dynamic and elaborate organisms. We are leaving behind ourselves the Modern idea as Architecture as an energetic machine to move towards new paradigms, new models based on local and energetic efficiency, innovation, costs attention and resources utilization that might improve people life quality, even in the social dwelling size. To achieve our purpose, we have taken environmental standards as project assumption {{in order to get}} closer in the interactions between building as a complex system and as ecosystem. We can apply the same sustainability assumptions in common practice and fast building-up procedures, combining vary types of durability, reversibility, reliability even with self-construction building procedure. As result of this way of thinking, the trial project, of a 35 sqm building module, starts. Moreover, in this study, takes place the electrochromic (EC) glass experimentation, shifted from continental to the mild Mediterranean climate. Studies started up in 2008 by a university and professional research team and have been focus on compatibility condition of EC selective glass with local materials production, answering to precise economical and environmental requirements in a more cost/benefit awaked vision for social dwelling target. Local materials supply, production quality, knowledge of the habitat and of the local building techniques as brought to privilege poor materials as straw, wood, <b>cork</b> and <b>wool.</b> With these basis, the module can fulfill different demands and functions, depending on the proper case, from the complex building type can be suitable as social dwelling module as well. The aim of this abstract is to show the development of the research project lead by Cagliari University DICAAR, merging the results of the use of EC glass in mild climate, with high quality performance solutions for builder company and local producers in order to test these solutions in vary of fields...|$|R
40|$|A low {{technological}} {{corn cob}} particleboard {{has been under}} research by this research team. It intends to be affordable and sustainable. So far, some of its assessed material properties (e. g. density, fire resistance, durability, thermal conductivity, compression and bending strengths, and impact resistance) suggest adequacy of this product for several building applications, such as a thermal insulation product, a light weight partition wall, a ceiling coating, or as indoor doors, among other possibilities. However, proper acoustic insulation performance is also a fundamental property required {{for most of the}} above identified building applications. Therefore, this paper is focused on evaluating the impact sound insulation potential of the proposed particleboard. At this stage, impact sound insulation tests have been performed in which the acoustic insulation gain of a pavement reinforced acoustically by a 3 cm thick corn cob particleboard was assessed. The obtained acoustic insulation gain was then compared with the respective ones of traditional sound insulation products (e. g. glass wool and expanded polystyrene) and also with different alternative natural sound insulation products (e. g. kenaf, coco fibre, sheep <b>wool,</b> <b>cork</b> and cellulose). The obtained results indicate that the proposed product may also have an interesting acoustic behaviour for building purposes. This conclusion is even more interesting taking into account that corn cob is a natural, organic, renewable and local raw building material...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{study area}} is a {{geographical}} entity organized around the floodplain of the lower river valley of the Oued Loukkos and the historic cities of Lixus and Larache. Owing to the double heritage value of this area, natural and historical, {{the reconstruction of the}} recent history of its vegetation and its landscapes is particularly relevant. Besides his former occupation in prehistory and antiquity, the area of Larache has {{played an important role in}} the Middle Ages and modern times into the greater or lesser strained relations between Morocco and European Powers. In the history, the river Loukkos has always been a route of penetration inside the country and its mouth a strategic site. The port of Larache was also the main export outlet for productions of Gharb and great cities of the hinterland as Basra or Fez (<b>cork,</b> grains, <b>wool</b> [...] .), since the 16 th century. Based on a pollen diagram obtained in the adjacent valley of Oued Sakh-Sokh, we propose here to reconstruct the outline of recent vegetation history (since 14 th century), especially the wetlands of the floodplain and the cork oak forest, which constitutes the natural vegetation of the area. This information will then crossed with available historical sources for assessing the various factors of landscape dynamics identified since medieval times. The role of different waves of population and their kinds of exploitation and enhancement of the environment are examined. Degradation of the forest is old because it is on the territory of the cork oak forest that clearing activities took place, mainly for cereal cultivation and livestock. Other human activities such as logging, charcoal production, shipbuilding or fires there also contributed. Agro-silvo-pastoral Parklands are built at the same time. They are comparable to the Dehesa and Montado from the Iberian Peninsula. The history of these original landscapes is recognized for the first time in Morocco. La reconstitution de l'histoire récente de la végétation et des paysages de la région du Bas-Loukkos, sur la côte atlantique de la péninsule tingitane, avec les villes historiques de Lixus et Larache, revêt un intérêt particulier en raison d'une double valeur patrimoniale : naturelle et historique. A partir d'un diagramme pollinique de l'Oued Sakh-Sokh, les grandes lignes de l'évolution récente de la végétation (depuis le 14 ème siècle) sont retracées, en particulier celle de la dépression humide et de la forêt de chêne-liège, qui constitue la végétation naturelle de la zone. Ces informations sont ensuite croisées avec les sources historiques disponibles pour apprécier les différents facteurs des dynamiques paysagères identifiées, depuis l'époque médiévale. Le rôle des différentes vagues de peuplement et leurs formes d'exploitation et de mise en valeur de l'espace est examiné. La dégradation de la forêt est ancienne. Élevage, agriculture et autres activités humaines (exploitation du bois, charbonnage, chantiers navals, incendies) y contribuèrent. Parallèlement, se construisent des parcs arborés à finalité agro-sylvo-pastorale comparables à la Dehesa et au Montado de la Péninsule Ibérique. L'histoire de ces paysages originaux est reconnue pour la première fois au Maroc...|$|R
40|$|In our {{everyday}} lives we come into intimate contact with surfaces covered with bacteria (i. e. doorknobs, desktops, children’s toys, etc.). Attachment of a polycationic species with proven bacteriocidal activity onto the target surface may render it antiseptic and therefore unable to transmit bacterial infections. Prior endeavors in our laboratory have been directed toward the preparation of antibacterial/antifungal porous surfaces (i. e. cotton cloth, wood, <b>cork,</b> silk and <b>wool).</b> These {{have resulted in the}} discovery and development of a general methodology for the synthesis of porous carbohydrate and protein-based surfaces that exhibit antibacterial and antifungal characteristics which are permanent (i. e. are not removed from the surface by physical means such as washing) and are continuing in their action (i. e. are not consumed by their action against bacteria and/or fungi). In the current proposal we continue to develop this technology toward applications such as wound dressings focusing on maximization of its action and toward control of a variety of organisms. Our work, in collaboration with Johnson 2 ̆ 6 Johnson Wound Management Division, initially involved the modification of alginate wound dressings. During the course of the work we have since geared our efforts to the synthesis of a new type of antibacterial/antifungal surface based on chitosan. The newly synthesized material has been tested (in collaboration with a biologist, Dr. Karin Melkonian, LIU, C. W. Post) and it has proven to kill fungi and bacteria on contact. We continue our efforts towards developing this new chitosan material into a smooth surface so that it may be used as a wound dressing. This project has involved synthetic work as well as molecular identification and characterization techniques. Collaborative efforts {{play a major role in}} our new technology. Our organic team works with a biological team and a variety of private companies that are interested in using our technology. To date, we have licensed out a part of our technology for the use of fabrics (woven and non woven) and are working on yet another agreement with a cosmetic applicator company on manufacturing antibacterial/antifungal brushes, applicators, and wigs. We are continuing our work towards the production of antimicrobial wound dressings. It is our hope that our technology may aid a variety of people in a variety of ways...|$|R
40|$|Since 1998, the United States Green Building Council, via the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards, has {{established}} the premiere {{set of guidelines}} for construction ethics {{from the standpoint of}} eco-friendliness and occupant safety and health in the U. S. and around the world. These guidelines are skyrocketing in use due in part to two reasons: ? increased awareness of a need for reducing, reusing, and recycling in order to save resources and natural areas for future generations; and, ? increased amount of time spent indoors in work places and homes. The LEED guidelines encourage sustainable and responsible use of land, water, energy, and materials, and promote a safe and healthy environment through use of innovative designs and technology. As part of the responsible use of materials, the LEED guidelines encourage the use of rapidly renewable materials such as cotton, straw, <b>wool,</b> and <b>cork</b> as insulation products. Although these products can be produced naturally and quickly from nature, they are also cellulose or carbohydrate based products. Cellulose and carbohydrate based materials are typically optimal food sources for mold in the presence of moisture, ironically destroying facilities and creating poor living and work environments. Samples of <b>wool,</b> <b>cork,</b> straw, and cotton [...] rapidly renewable materials used as exterior wall insulation products [...] were exposed to different moisture amounts in an encapsulated environment, representing the environment within a wall cavity when exposed to water from pipes, leaks, condensation and absorption, or from initial construction. The samples were monitored over time for mold growth. The data logged from the samples were analyzed to determine the degree of mold susceptibility of each material. In addition, samples with increased amounts of moisture were examined to determine increased promotion of mold growth. The results from this study showed that all of the above mentioned materials were highly susceptible to mold growth and that the moisture amount did not increase the rate of mold growth. Based on the data collected from this study, recommendations were made to review the current use of rapidly renewable and other cellulose and carbohydrate based materials in wall construction...|$|R
