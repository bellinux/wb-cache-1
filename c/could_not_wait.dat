5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided that they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and {{wanted to do something}} new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E
5|$|At 00:50, {{aircraft}} {{carrying the}} rest of the 6th Airborne Division appeared overhead and the paratroopers descended onto drop zones marked out by the pathfinders. Howard began blowing the morse code letter 'V' on his whistle, to help guide the 7th Parachute Battalion to the bridges. The first paratroops to arrive, at 00:52, were Brigadier Poett and the soldier he had picked up en route. Briefed by Howard on the situation, they heard tanks and lorries moving around in BÃ©nouville and Le Port. On the drop zone, only about 100 men of the 7th Parachute Battalion had made it to the rallying point but all their signal equipment, machine guns and mortars were missing. Pine-Coffin, aware that his battalion was the only unit allocated defensive positions west of the bridges, decided they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> any longer and, at 01:10, left for the bridges.|$|E
5|$|The 1891 {{constitution}} added {{a provision}} that the governor must specify the reason for any specially-called legislative session, and that no other business could be considered during the session. There is, however, no constitutional requirement that the legislature conduct any business during the called session. In 2007, Republican governor Ernie Fletcher called the Assembly into session to consider {{a long list of}} items. The Democratically-controlled House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough that they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> until the regular session convened; they claimed that Fletcher was calling the session only to boost his sagging poll numbers before the upcoming election in which he faced a challenge from Democrat Steve Beshear. The House convened on the day appointed and adjourned an hour later without transacting any business.|$|E

But Fan's news settled that point, and just now the look in my Polly's face settled the other.

25|$|The parable {{begins with}} a young man, the younger of two sons, who asks his father to give him {{his share of the}} estate. The {{implication}} is the son <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> for his father's death for his inheritance, he wanted it immediately. The father agrees and divides his estate between both sons.|$|E

25|$|As {{they were}} down to a few days rations, the Confederates <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> indefinitely, so at a council of war on the 18th, Sibley ordered the army to cross the Rio Grande and move up {{the eastern side of}} the river to the ford near Valverde, six miles north of Fort Craig, hoping to cut Union {{communications}} between the fort and their headquarters in Santa Fe.|$|E
25|$|When the Pharaoh {{freed the}} Israelites, {{it is said}} that they left in such a hurry that they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> for bread dough to rise (leaven). In commemoration, for the {{duration}} of Passover no leavened bread is eaten, for which reason Passover was called the feast of unleavened bread in the Torah or Old Testament. Thus matzo (flat unleavened bread) is eaten during Passover and it is a tradition of the holiday.|$|E
25|$|Henry {{probably}} <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> long {{to replace}} Richard, as the Welsh were resurgent under the charismatic leadership of Gruffudd ap Cynan. According to the Historia Regum, Richard's death prompted the Welsh to raid Cheshire, looting, killing, and burning two castles. Perhaps {{because of his}} recognised military ability and social strength, because he was loyal {{and because he was}} the closest male relation to Earl Richard, Henry recognized Ranulf as Richard's successor to the county of Chester.|$|E

25|$|After {{five and}} a half weeks of negotiations, Molotov refused the demands and the talks were adjourned. Marshall was {{particularly}} discouraged after personally meeting with Stalin, who expressed little interest in a solution to German economic problems. The United States concluded that a solution <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> any longer. In a 5 June 1947 speech, Marshall announced a comprehensive program of American assistance to all European countries wanting to participate, including the Soviet Union and those of Eastern Europe, called the Marshall Plan.|$|E
25|$|As {{reported}} by Wright's apprentices at Taliesin, Kaufmann Sr. was in Milwaukee on September 22, {{nine months after}} their initial meeting, and called Wright at home early Sunday morning to surprise him {{with the news that}} he would be visiting Wright that day, before lunch. He <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> to see Wright's plans. Wright had told Kaufmann in earlier communication that he had been working on the plans, but had not actually drawn anything. After breakfast that morning, amid a group of very nervous apprentices, Wright calmly drew the plans in the two hours in which it took Kaufmann to drive to Taliesin.|$|E
25|$|After the Balkan Wars, Thessaloniki was {{incorporated}} into the Greek Kingdom. At first the community feared that the annexation would lead to difficulties and during the first years its political stance was, in general, anti-Venizelist and pro-royalist/conservative. The Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 during World War I burned much {{of the center of}} the city and left 50,000 Jews homeless of the total of 72,000 residents who were burned out. Having lost homes and their businesses, many Jews emigrated: to the United States, Palestine, and Paris. They <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> for the government to create a new urban plan for rebuilding, which was eventually done.|$|E

25|$|In April 1687, James {{ordered the}} fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford {{to elect a}} Catholic, Anthony Farmer, as their president. The fellows {{believed}} Farmer ineligible under the college's statutes and so elected John Hough instead. The college statutes required them to fill the vacancy within a certain time and so <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> for a further royal nomination. James refused to view Hough's election as valid and told the fellows to elect the Bishop of Oxford. James responded by sending some ecclesiastical commissioners to hold a visitation and install him as president. The fellows then agreed to the Bishop of Oxford as their president but James required that they admit {{they had been in}} the wrong and ask for his pardon. When they refused most of the fellows were ejected and replaced by Catholics.|$|E
25|$|After teaming {{together}} since 1985, The Rockers split up in December 1991 after backstage disputes. The {{exact nature of}} the dispute has not been confirmed by the WWF other {{than it was a}} monetary issue that lead to Jannetty quitting the WWF on behalf of both Rockers. According to Michaels's book, Jannetty had claimed that World Championship Wrestling were willing to give them a very high guaranteed contract but when Michaels inquired about it {{it turned out to be}} an exaggeration. Jannetty disputes this saying that Michaels was the driving force suggesting to quit the WWF, but had Jannetty do the phone call to ask for a release from their contract. When Vince McMahon actually agreed to let them go Michaels appeared shocked according to him, and later went to McMahon unbeknownst to him to explain this was Jannetty's idea only and that he had no intention of leaving the WWF himself. After cooler heads prevailed it was decided that The Rockers should split with Michaels turning heel to feud with Jannetty. Jannetty was not happy about the team splitting, while Michaels <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> to work as a singles wrestler.|$|E

That evening, Lambert was in bed and admitted to feeling tired, but nonetheless he was able to discuss his requirements with the printer, and was anxious that the handbills be delivered on time.|$|E

500|$|... "Raining Men" [...] {{marked the}} second {{collaboration}} between Rihanna's and Minaj, the first being Minaj's song [...] "Fly", from her album Pink Friday (2010), on which Rihanna {{appeared as a}} guest vocalist. During an interview with Capital FM radio station in London, England, Rihanna revealed that herself and Minaj had written songs together, specifically ballads, for possible inclusion on the formers fourth studio album, Rated R (2009), however none of the songs made the final track listing. Rihanna concluded her statement by saying that she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> to collaborate with the rapper again for her fifth studio album, the at the time unreleased and unnamed Loud. When questioned about what [...] "Raining Men" [...] was like, the singer stated that it is [...] "a really fun song. Nothing like the original.

His team wanted to maximise every detail feasible and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> to drive on the track. Mahindra driver Felix Rosenqvist stated that his target for the event was to continue the momentum his team built at the season's previous round. He wanted to extract the maximum amount possible from his car's package as soon as he could even at the cost of still learning slightly more about his vehicle. However, he was unsure whether the track's layout suited him because it required a different driving style and rhythm than in Hong Kong.|$|E

He added [...] "What's interesting {{is that a lot of}} feedback has been about the fact the character's coming out wasn't a [...] "warm and fuzzy" [...] experience, that there were rough spots. They appreciated the authenticity of the story, and I think that comes from the character and storylines being based on other people's real life experiences." [...] Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun branded Chris Erinsborough's token gay. He added [...] "Good on Neighbours for not having their gay character flouncing around in a midriff top listening to Britney Spears." [...] Inside Soap's staff said that they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>wait</b> to see how Chris would get on with Aidan. They added that it was [...] "high time he had a boyfriend". Of the Chris and Scotty storyline, Melinda Houston from The Sun-Herald wrote [...] "Good on Neighbours for not just having an ongoing gay character but using him to explore some interesting issues.|$|E
