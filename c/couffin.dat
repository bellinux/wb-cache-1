50|$|The word {{took two}} {{different}} paths, cofin in Old French originally meaning basket, became coffin in English and became <b>couffin</b> in modern French which nowadays means a cradle. A distinction is often made between coffin and casket: {{the latter is}} generally understood to denote a four-sided (almost always rectangular) funerary box, while a coffin is usually six-sided. However, coffins having a one-piece side with a curve at the shoulder instead of a join are more commonly used in the United Kingdom (UK).|$|E

In 1985, she played her first major screen role (and earned a nomination for the César Award for Most Promising Actress), playing the distraught mother in Trois hommes et un <b>couffin</b> (Three Men And A Cradle). The success of Coline Serreau's comedy helped her film career and a string of parts in costume films followed such films as Andrzej Wajda's Les Possédés in 1988, Philippe Le Guay's Les Deux Fragonard, and Robert Enrico's and Richard T. Heffron's La Révolution française (Mademoiselle Leroy-Beaulieu acted out the role of Charlotte Corday in the latter production), whose release in 1989 was timed to coincide with celebrations for the bi-centenary of the 1789 Revolution.|$|E
40|$|Marie-Christine Anest <b>Couffin,</b> Mythical Time and the Egg in the Greek popular {{calendar}} The ritual {{use of the}} egg in the Greek holiday calendar {{is associated}} with the cyclical dimension of a highly-charged-sense of time. The festive days of Spring represent the tradition between the Winter and Summer seasons and symbolize the abolition of time and regeneration. Socially, it is the time of the regeneration of the individual and of the group. In this calendar-time-space, the egg plays a fundamental role in symbolizing the passage from one state to another.
