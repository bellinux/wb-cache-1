5|$|Synthetic diamond has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, {{because it can}} be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or n-type semiconductor. Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high <b>carrier</b> <b>mobility,</b> which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond. High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50GHz. The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.|$|E
25|$|Lower {{transconductance}}: The transconductance of the MOSFET decides its {{gain and}} {{is proportional to}} hole or electron mobility (depending on device type), at least for low drain voltages. As MOSFET size is reduced, the fields in the channel increase and the dopant impurity levels increase. Both changes reduce the <b>carrier</b> <b>mobility,</b> and hence the transconductance. As channel lengths are reduced without proportional reduction in drain voltage, raising the electric field in the channel, the result is velocity saturation of the carriers, limiting the current and the transconductance.|$|E
500|$|Germanium {{has largely}} been {{replaced}} by silicon in semiconducting devices, being cheaper, more resilient at higher operating temperatures, and easier to work during the microelectronic fabrication process. Germanium is still a constituent of semiconducting silicon-germanium [...] "alloys" [...] and these have been growing in use, particularly for wireless communication devices; such alloys exploit the higher <b>carrier</b> <b>mobility</b> of germanium. The synthesis of gram-scale quantities of semiconducting germanane was reported in 2013. This comprises one-atom thick sheets of hydrogen-terminated germanium atoms, analogous to graphane. It conducts electrons more than ten times faster than silicon and five times faster than germanium, and {{is thought to have}} potential for optoelectronic and sensing applications. The development of a germanium-wire based anode that more than doubles the capacity of lithium-ion batteries was reported in 2014. In the same year, Lee at al. reported that defect-free crystals of graphene large enough to have electronic uses could be grown on, and removed from, a germanium substrate.|$|E

Partial relaxation of the Zn 3 P 2 lattice was observed for films that were > 150 nm in thickness.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the radiative efficiency limits of organic bulk heterojunction solar cells {{according to the}} theory of Shockley and Queisser and compare the results with experimental device performance. The difference between limiting theory (23 % power conversion efficiency) and experimental data (4 %) is explained and quantified by five reasons, namely the energy level misalignment at the donor/acceptor heterointerface of the bulk heterojunction, insufficient light trapping, low exciton diffusion lengths, nonradiative recombination, and low charge <b>carrier</b> <b>mobilities.</b> Comparison {{of the impact of the}} different loss mechanisms by numerical simulation reveals that efficiencies above 10 % using PF 10 TBT/PCBM blends will require mostly a strong reduction of nonradiative recombination.

40|$|A typical {{signature}} of charge extraction in disordered organic systems is dispersive transport, which implies a distribution of charge <b>carrier</b> <b>mobilities</b> that negatively impact on device performance. Dispersive transport has been commonly understood to originate from a time-dependent mobility of hot charge carriers that reduces as excess {{energy is lost}} during relaxation in the density of states. In contrast, we show via photon energy, electric field and film thickness independence of <b>carrier</b> <b>mobilities</b> that the dispersive photocurrent in organic solar cells originates not {{from the loss of}} excess energy during hot carrier thermalization, but rather from the loss of carrier density to trap states during transport. Our results emphasize that further efforts should be directed to minimizing the density of trap states, rather than controlling energetic relaxation of hot carriers within the density of states...|$|R

Two types of discotic liquid crystals, perylene diimides and coronene diimides, can form columnar liquid crystalline phases {{over a wide}} temperature range; many of them can have room-temperature liquid crystalline phases after cooling from isotropic liquid. Their charge transport properties were studied by space-charge limited current method; high charge <b>carrier</b> <b>mobilities,</b> with the highest being up to 6. 6 cm 2 /Vs, were found in liquid crystalline phases of these materials under ambient conditions. Structural variables, including aromatic cores and side groups, were examined to get {{a certain degree of}} understanding of charge transport properties in these discotic liquid crystals.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of electrically conducting organic crystals 1 and polymers(1 - 4) has widened {{the range of}} potential optoelectronic materials(5 - 9), provided these exhibit sufficiently high charge carrier mobilities(6 - 10) and are easy to make and process. Organic single crystals have high charge <b>carrier</b> <b>mobilities</b> but are usually impractical(11), whereas polymers have good processability but low mobilities(1, 12). Liquid crystals exhibit mobilities approaching those of single crystals and are suitable for applications(13 - 18), but demanding fabrication and processing methods limit their use. Here we show that the self- assembly of fluorinated tapered dendrons can drive the formation of supramolecular liquid crystals with promising optoelectronic properties {{from a wide range}} of organic materials. We find that attaching conducting organic donor or acceptor groups to the apex of the dendrons leads to supramolecular nanometre-scale columns that contain in their cores pi-stacks of donors, acceptors or donor-acceptor complexes exhibiting high charge <b>carrier</b> <b>mobilities.</b> When we use functionalized dendrons and amorphous polymers carrying compatible side groups, these co-assemble so that the polymer is incorporated in the centre of the columns through donor- acceptor interactions and exhibits enhanced charge <b>carrier</b> <b>mobilities.</b> We anticipate that this simple and versatile strategy for producing conductive pi-stacks of aromatic groups, surrounded by helical dendrons, will lead to a new class of supramolecular materials suitable for electronic and optoelectronic applications...|$|R
