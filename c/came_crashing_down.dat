25|$|Cosgrave's Government {{signed the}} Sunningdale Agreement that {{appeared}} to provide {{a solution to the}} Northern Ireland problem in December 1973. A powersharing executive was set up and a Council of Ireland was to be established but it all <b>came</b> <b>crashing</b> <b>down</b> in May 1974 {{as a consequence of the}} Ulster Workers' Council Strike. In addition many Republican voters were angered by what they saw as Cosgrave's harsh line on the PIRA and the handling of the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings which resulted in the perpetrators walking scot-free.|$|E
25|$|Suddenly, in 1988, it all <b>came</b> <b>crashing</b> <b>down</b> for Switzer. His {{team was}} placed on {{probation}} by the NCAA for violating several rules. In a six-month time frame, there was a shooting and a rape in the athletic dorm on Oklahoma's campus. Switzer's house was robbed {{with the help of}} one of his athletes, and an athlete was caught attempting to sell drugs to an undercover agent. The three-year probation included a two-year ban on TV and bowl appearances and a reduction in scholarships from 25 to 18. Nonetheless, the 1988 team established the NCAA Division I single-game record of 768yards rushing against Kansas State on October 15, 1988, a record that stands to this day. After the season, Switzer resigned as head coach.|$|E
500|$|During {{a promotional}} {{interview}} in September, {{the month before}} the album was released, Noel spoke about the rivalry with Damon Albarn and Alex James from Blur, and {{was quoted in the}} 17 September edition of The Observer saying he hoped [...] "the pair of them would catch AIDS and die because I fucking hate them two." [...] The quote caused a storm of controversy, with Noel having to write a letter of apology; he later confessed that [...] "my whole world <b>came</b> <b>crashing</b> <b>down</b> in on me then". However, in an interview with The Guardian in 2005, Blur's guitarist Graham Coxon explained that he bore no malice towards Oasis. [...] "At least they were outright about it. They weren't pretending to like us and then slagging us off, which is what we'd been used to. In that way, I quite appreciated them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Richard Brody of The New Yorker panned the film, stating: [...] "This thrill-free thriller...piles up plotlines like an overbuilt {{house of}} cards that <b>comes</b> <b>crashing</b> <b>down</b> at the first well-earned guffaw of ridicule." ...|$|R

500|$|A {{handsome}} man with even features, Jackson lived a lifestyle of a Hollywood actor during his playing career, spending money freely, driving fast cars and attending posh parties. [...] Maple Leafs' owner Conn Smythe unsuccessfully {{tried to convince}} Jackson to save his money for the future, even offering to match his player's savings dollar for dollar. Jackson's habits, particularly his drinking, ultimately {{played a role in}} his trade away from Toronto. Jackson's lifestyle <b>came</b> <b>crashing</b> <b>down</b> following his retirement as a player as he no longer had the money to fund his pursuits. He unsuccessfully tried to overcome his alcoholism, lost two marriages to divorce, struggled to hold a job, and it was said that he could be found outside Maple Leaf Gardens trying to sell broken sticks of Maple Leaf players to try to make some money. He emerged as one of hockey's tragic figures.|$|E

I was ready to go but everything <b>came</b> <b>crashing</b> <b>down,</b> so to speak, but these things happen. It was frustrating, but at the same time, I know everything happens for a reason. I don't know what that reason is, only God knows. I {{just have to wait and}} let His plan unveil." ...|$|E
2500|$|The close {{relation}} between the papacy and the branch declined over the years, with the decline especially pronounced after 1464, with few to no branch managers being selected to be the [...] "depositary-general", the official who was essentially the fiscal agent for the Apostolic Chamber, or the Church's treasury. Pope Sixtus IV would repudiate the Medici's control of the alum trade and also his debts to them, as well as seizing Medici property in Rome following the Pazzi Conspiracy in 1478. The Pazzi's interlocked businesses and banks had captured the alum business after the Medici were removed from it, and were supplying the depositary-general from their ranks, indicating {{that they were trying}} to follow the Medici route of initially building up their empire through papal custom. The papacy would eventually agree to repay the debts, but did so extremely slowly; so slowly that the branch manager Giovanni Tornabouni agreed to take stocks of alum instead, despite the depressed market for alum. Tornabuoni would still be in charge when 1494 came and the edifice of the Medici <b>came</b> <b>crashing</b> <b>down.</b> Because the branch had been doing so poorly, it owed more than it was due, so the Roman government was satisfied to allow Tornabouni to assume the rest of the partnership's equity and debts.|$|E

2500|$|Two more near-disasters on May 17 led to {{the naming}} of {{additional}} features. [...] William Clark was nearly bitten by a rattlesnake while exploring a creek on the northern side of the river. [...] This creek was named Rattlesnake Creek (although today it is called Timber Creek). [...] The party camped near a creek {{on the south side}} of the river that evening. [...] Clark saw a fortified Native American lodge a short distance up the creek, believing it to be an Atsina (Gros Ventre) site. Late that night, a cottonwood tree sheltering the camp caught fire from sparks rising from the expedition campfire. [...] The men were barely able to get out of their tent and pull it out of the way before the tree <b>came</b> <b>crashing</b> <b>down</b> on the site. [...] Lewis named this Burnt Lodge Creek (although today it is known as Seven Blackfoot Creek). [...] On May 20, the expedition passed the Musselshell River. On May 22, the party passed another creek, which they decided to name Sacajawea Creek. (Later renamed Crooked Creek, the U.S. government formally changed the name back to Sacagawea Creek in 1979.) The Corps of Discovery left the CMR NWF on May 24 or 25, after spending a week passing through and exploring the area.|$|E
