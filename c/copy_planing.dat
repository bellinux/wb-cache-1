50|$|Due to the {{assumption}} of periodic boundary conditions, plane-wave basis sets are less well suited to gas-phase calculations than localized basis sets. Large regions of vacuum need to be added {{on all sides of}} the gas-phase molecule in order to avoid interactions with the molecule and its periodic <b>copies.</b> However, the <b>plane</b> waves use a similar accuracy to describe the vacuum region as the region where the molecule is, meaning that obtaining the truly noninteracting limit may be computationally costly.|$|R
40|$|Banyan {{networks}} are attractive for constructing directional coupler (DC) -based optical switching networks for their small depth and self-routing capability. Crosstalk between optical signals {{passing through the}} same DC is an intrinsic drawback in DC-based optical networks. Vertical stacking of multiple copies of an optical banyan network is a novel scheme for building nonblocking (crosstalk-free) optical switching networks. The resulting network, namely vertically stacked optical banyan (VSOB) network, preserves all {{the properties of the}} banyan network, but increases the hardware cost significantly. Though much work has been done for determining the minimum number of stacked <b>copies</b> (<b>planes)</b> required for a nonblocking VSOB network, little is known on analyzing the blocking probabilities of VSOB networks that do not meet the nonblocking condition (i. e., with fewer stacked copies than required by the nonblocking condition). In this paper, we analyze the blocking probabilities of VSOB networks and develop their upper and lower bounds with respect to the number of planes in the networks. These bounds depict accurately the overall blocking behaviors of VSOB networks and agree with the conditions of strictly nonblocking and rearrangeably nonblocking VSOB networks respectively. Extensive simulation on a network simulator with both random routing and packing strategy has shown that the blocking probabilities of both strategies fall nicely within our bounds, and the blocking probability of packing strategy actually matches the lower bound. The proposed bounds are significant because they reveal the inherent relationships between blocking probability and network hardware cost {{in terms of the number}} of planes, and provide network developers a quantitative guidance to trade blocking probability for hardware cost. In particular, our bounds provide network designers an effective tool to estimate the minimum and maximum blocking probabilities of VSOB networks in which different routing strategies may be applied. An interesting conclusion drawn from our work that has practical applications is that the hardware cost of a VSOB network can be reduced dramatically if a predictable and almost negligible nonzero blocking probability is allowed.

By May, 1917, his victory total was up to 12. He was unhappy with the tail assembly of this aircraft because he felt it lacked directional stability. He redesigned the horn-balanced rudder with a low aspect fin and a plain rudder. His redesign was later <b>copied</b> from his <b>plane</b> and became standard on the D1.

50|$|Hermann Göring, {{who flew}} both the Fokker Dr.I and Fokker D.VII was so annoyed {{with the case}} {{tumbling}} {{out in front of}} him that he had deflectors made on his aircraft to ensure the empty cartridge cases did not find their way into his cockpit. On photographs of Göring's aircraft these plates, seen only on his aircraft, are very prevalent and have even been recognized in scale models of his aircraft <b>copying</b> his particular <b>planes,</b> but even then most historians have failed to recognize their purpose. Both empty belt guides and trays were attached directly to the machine guns rather than to the aircraft. In the famous film showing Australian officers handling the LMG 08/15's from Baron von Richthofen's crashed triplane, the Fokker type belt tubes/chutes and empty cartridge trays can be clearly seen still attached to the guns.|$|R

40|$|High {{proved the}} {{following}} theorem. If the intersections of any two congruent <b>copies</b> of a <b>plane</b> convex body are centrally symmetric, then this {{body is a}} circle. In our paper we extend the theorem of High to spherical and hyperbolic planes. If {{in any of these}} planes, or in R^ 2, there is a pair of closed convex sets with interior points, and the intersections of any congruent copies of these sets are centrally symmetric, then, under some mild hypotheses, our sets are congruent circles, or, for R^ 2, two parallel strips. We prove the analogue of this statement, for S^d, R^d, H^d, if we suppose C^ 2 _+: again, our sets are congruent balls. In S^ 2, R^ 2 and H^ 2 we investigate a variant of this question: supposing that the numbers of connected components of the boundaries of both sets are finite, we exactly describe all pairs of such closed convex sets, with interior points, whose any congruent copies have an intersection with axial symmetry (there are 1, 5 or 9 cases, respectively).

40|$|Ahstract-This paper {{shows how}} {{interactive}} graphical preprocessors can treat inconsistent data to generate consistent finite element and structural models. Algorithms are described for checking the geometrical and topological consistency of three-dimensional meshes {{made up of}} one-dimensional finite elements. With the consistency guaranteed, the user of a graphical preprocessor can freely create the geometry and topology of a structure {{with his or her}} attention concentrated only on the image shown on the screen. Inconsistencies like repeated nodes or partially overlapped bars are left to the system to solve. 1. INTRODUCI’ION A finite element model must be consistent for the computation to succeed. If there are errors in defining the mesh, then the computation may advance until aborting or, even worse, it may produce results which are wrong [l]. Graphical preprocessors {{have come a long way}} to minimize problems in the finite element data generation [2, 3]. With the use of these systems, the process of defining data has undoubtedly become more creative and reliable. There are, however, a few issues which remain to be solved. One of these issues is related to the consistency of the geometrical/topological model generated by the preprocessor with respect o finite element modeling rules.

40|$|We study {{partitions}} {{of the set}} of all ((v) (3)) triples {{chosen from}} a v-set into pairwise disjoint planes with three points per line. Our partitions may contain copies of PG(2, 2) only (Fano partitions) or copies of AG(2, 3) only (affine partitions) or <b>copies</b> of some <b>planes</b> of each type (mixed partitions). We find necessary conditions for Fano or affine partitions to exist. Such partitions are already known in several cases: Fano partitions for v = 8 and affine partitions for v = 9 or 10. We construct such partitions for several sporadic orders, namely, Fano partitions for v = 14, 16, 22, 23, 28, and an affine partition for v = 18. Using these as starter partitions, we prove that Fano partitions exist for v = 7 (n) + 1, 13 (n) + 1, 27 (n) + 1, and affine partitions for v = 8 (n) + 1, 9 (n) + 1, 17 (n) + 1. In particular, both Fano and affine partitions exist for v = 3 (6 n) + 1. Using properties of 3 -wise balanced designs, we extend these results to show that affine partitions also exist for v = 3 (2 n). Similarly, mixed partitions are shown to exist for v = 8 (n), 9 (n), 11 (n) + 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{geometric}} approach to stable homotopy groups of spheres {{in the spirit}} of the work of Pontrjagin and Rokhlin. A new proof of the Hopf Invariant One Theorem by J. F. Adams is obtained in all dimensions except 15 and 31. To prove that the stable Hopf invariant H: Π_n → Z/ 2 vanishes for n> 31, we apply methods of geometric topology. The Pontrjagin-Thom construction along with Hirsch's compression lemma identify every α∈Π_n with the framed bordism class of a framed immersion of a closed n-manifold into R^n+k, for any given k> 0. Its self-intersection M projects to an immersion f: M → R^n which is framed by k copies of a line bundle κ. It is well-known that H(α) =. The self-intersection N of f is framed by k <b>copies</b> of a <b>plane</b> bundle with structure group D_ 4. We observe that H(α) =, where i immerses the double cover N̅ of N into M. The hardest part of the proof is to show that, after modifying f in its skew-framed bordism class, the classifying map g: N → K(D_ 4, 1) factors through K(Z/ 4, 1), provided that n= 2 ^l- 1, l> 5 and n- 2 k= 15. This is achieved by analyzing immersions in the regular homotopy class of f that approximate the composition of the classifying map M → RP^n-k, the projection of RP^n-k onto the join of copies of S^ 1 /(Z/ 4) (the standard sphere), and an embedding of this join in R^n. The last step is proved with the quaternions. Comment: 99 pages, in Russia...|$|R
