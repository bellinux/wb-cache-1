5000|$|The Frontline <b>Combat</b> <b>Rocket</b> ( [...] фронтовая крылатая ракета, Soviet pact nickname: Meteor) (Nato code: SSC-2a Salish) was {{a nuclear}} capable mobile {{launching}} system designed for ground combat. With a 12 kiloton warhead and 180 km range it entered the equipment of Soviet and DDR forces in 1957.|$|E
50|$|The only rocket-powered fighter ever {{deployed}} was the Messerschmitt Me 163B Komet. The Komet had a HWK 109-509A {{rocket motor}} which consumed methanol/hydrazine as fuel and high test peroxide as oxidizer. The hypergolic rocket motor {{had the advantage}} of fast climb and quick-hitting tactics at the cost of being very volatile and capable of exploding with any degree of inattention. Other proposed <b>combat</b> <b>rocket</b> fighters like the Heinkel Julia and reconnaissance aircraft like the DFS 228 were meant to use the Walter 509 series of rocket motors, but besides the Me 163, only the Bachem Ba 349 Natter vertical launch expendable fighter was ever flight-tested with the Walter rocket propulsion system as its primary sustaining thrust system for military-purpose aircraft.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} phases of Operation Paperclip, these {{recruits}} mostly included aerospace engineers from the German V-2 <b>combat</b> <b>rocket</b> program, experts in aerospace medicine and synthetic fuels. Perhaps {{the most influential}} of these was Wernher Von Braun, who had worked on the Aggregate rockets (the first rocket program to reach outer space), and chief designer of the V-2 rocket program. Upon reaching US soil, Von Braun first worked on the U.S. Air Force ICBM program before his team was reassigned to NASA. Often credited as “The Father of Rocket Science,” {{his work on the}} Redstone rocket and the successful deployment of the Explorer 1 satellite as a response to Sputnik 1 {{marked the beginning of the}} American Space program, and therefore, of the Space Race. Von Braun’s subsequent development of the Saturn V booster for NASA in the mid-to late sixties resulted in the first manned moon landing, the Apollo 11 mission, in 1969.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea of a}} heavy {{short-range}} MLRS {{to launch}} rockets equipped with incendiary and thermobaric warheads arose in the late 1970s. The combat system consisting of the <b>combat</b> vehicle, <b>rockets,</b> and loading vehicle was developed in early 1980s at KBTM in Omsk and was named TOS-1, remaining a secret development for a long time.|$|R
50|$|As of October 2007, Darkwind had 50+ unique {{vehicle chassis}} {{including}} subcompacts, sedans, muscle cars, SUVs and larger vans and trucks. 14 different engines and 50+ weapons ranging from rams and flamethrowers for close <b>combat</b> to <b>rocket</b> launchers and mortars for long-range mayhem. Each of the chassis and weapons offers different advantages which allows players {{to create a}} range of unique and interesting vehicle designs. The weapons have detailed statistics underlying them: recoil, close range and ranged accuracy, damage factors, psychological 'fear factors', ammunition, and so on.|$|R
500|$|The Chinese Song Dynasty created fire arrows - rockets {{attached}} to arrows and launched in mass through platforms, and later created rockets {{such as the}} huo long chu shui, a multistage rocket used in naval <b>combat.</b> Primitive <b>rockets</b> made from bamboo and leather were used by the Mongols, under Genghis Khan, but were inaccurate. However, the Fatamids used [...] "Chinese arrows" [...] from the 11th Century, which probably included saltpetre. [...] The Mamluks experimented with a rocket-powered weapon described as [...] "an egg which moves itself and burns." ...|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{produced}} {{examples of}} the Bachem Ba 349 Natter ("Viper") manned vertical take-off rocket interceptor were armed with a battery of 24 Föhn missiles in its nose-cone. So far as is known, the Ba 349 was never used in <b>combat,</b> though the <b>rocket</b> weapon system was extensively ground-tested.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} movie, Mewtwo erased all memory of the events from all those involved. However, due to his not being on New Island at the time, Giovanni has not {{forgotten}} about Mewtwo, and has been concocting a military plan of assault upon wherever Mewtwo has settled to take the Pokémon back for himself. He at last locates Mewtwo in his new mountain retreat and begins his operation to assault and capture Mewtwo and bend his will to Giovanni's. The Team <b>Rocket</b> <b>combat</b> unit heads towards Mt. Quena.|$|R
50|$|Rocket Forces and Artillery {{troops of}} the army consist of {{formations}} of tactical missiles, self-propelled artillery, howitzers, jet-propelled and anti-tank artillery, artillery reconnaissance units, of mortar units and of units of anti-tank missiles. These forces operate as support for other army formations, and are therefore obliged to destroy enemy human resources, tanks, artillery, anti-tanks weapons, aircraft, air defence equipment, and other important objects during the <b>combat</b> arms operations. <b>Rocket</b> and artillery troops are equipped with: missile complexes of operational-tactical and tactical missiles; Multiple rocket launcher rocket systems, such as the Smerch, Uragan, Grad; also, Giatsint, Pion, Akatsiya, Gvozdika howitzers; and, Konkurs, T-12 antitank gun anti-tank weapons.|$|R
5000|$|Production {{aircraft}} {{identical to}} the YP-43 prototypes, were designated [...] "Lancer" [...] and were delivered between 16 May and 28 August 1941. Ongoing delays in the P-47 program resulted in USAAC ordering an additional 80 P-43J, with Pratt & Whitney R-2180-1 Twin Hornet engine rated at [...] The engine promised better high-altitude performance, and armament was upgraded with 0.50 in machine guns replacing the 0.30 in in the wings. The USAAC was sufficiently interested to assign the AP-4J variant an official designation P-44 <b>Rocket.</b> <b>Combat</b> reports from Europe indicated that the new type was already obsolete, consequently, the entire order was canceled on 13 September 1940, with no prototypes built.|$|R
50|$|The {{player is}} {{concerned}} with defending themselves and their factory from the planet's increasingly aggressive indigenous fauna, who become increasingly more hostile as pollutant emissions created by the player's industry increase, necessitating the importance for the player to consider the balance between their production and the enemy's aggressiveness. There are four types of enemies: Biters, Spitters, Worms, and Spawners. Biter and Spitters are produced by Spawners absorbing pollution, and will intermittently form large groups to attack the player's industry. Worms are powerful stationary defenses that protect Spawners. Combat {{can be done in}} the early game with a pistol, which then leads to a sub-machine gun, a shotgun, a <b>combat</b> shotgun, a <b>rocket</b> launcher, a flamethrower, and in extreme cases, nuclear missiles. In case of emergency, the player can also attack by swinging their pickaxe at an enemy. Ammunition also has multiple types, starting with cheap but weak conventional rounds and progressing to piercing rounds and eventually depleted uranium rounds.|$|R
5000|$|The first type of Ogbunigwe to be {{produced}} and tested in <b>combat</b> was the <b>rocket</b> propelled surface to surface missile. It was originally designed as a {{surface to air missile}} to be used in defense against Nigerian MiG-15 fighters marauding the Enugu airport. Before the missile could be used successfully at its actual purpose as an anti aircraft missile, Nigerian troops captured Enugu where the missiles were being produced in October 1967. Following the fall of Enugu, a group of retreating Biafran soldiers were fighting rear guard action against a battalion of heavily armed Nigerian troops at the Ugwuoba bridge along the old Enugu-Awka road. As the ammunition of the Biafran troops was exhausted their commander ordered them, as a last resort, to adapt the use of the Ogbunigwe surface to air missile they were equipped with, by launching them horizontally at the enemy instead of vertically as designed for anti aircraft action. The effect was devastating and extensive. As a result of this incident, the missile was converted and utilized {{for the rest of the}} war as a surface-to-surface missile, and as a surface-to-ship missile during the Second Invasion of Onitsha. The name Ogbunigwe literally means [...] "instrument that kills in multitudes" [...] in the Igbo language.|$|R
50|$|This light piston-propeller {{training}} aircraft is primarily intended for initial and basic training of military pilots. With in-line tandem seating, the trainer {{was developed in}} accordance with the Federal Aviation Regulations (Joint Aviation Requirements) 23 regulations for acrobatic category of airplanes and it provides an easy transition to Kobac and then to jet at higher training levels.
