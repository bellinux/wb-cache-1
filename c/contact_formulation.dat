40|$|Granular {{materials}} {{is the second}} most manipulated material in the industry today. They are easy to transport and more and more newly developed materials cannot stand the process of traditional casting, like energetic materials and bio-materials, but will survive the powder compaction process. Having {{a better understanding of the}} microstructure development of granular systems during compaction process, especially for particles that will heavily deform under loading, will give an insight of how to better process the powders to produce materials with overall better performance comparing to bulk materials. The main theory and mechanism applied are Hertz law and nonlocal <b>contact</b> <b>formulation.</b> Hertz law considers contact forces as completely local, which means the contact forces are independent. Nonlocal <b>contact</b> <b>formulation</b> removes this assumption and considers the effect of all the forces acting on one single particle, which extends the theory to granular systems at high relative density. Simulated results using both Hertz theory and nonlocal <b>contact</b> <b>formulation</b> are expected to differ more and more as the relative density increase, or with lower material modulus and higher Poisson ratio and the results from nonlocal <b>contact</b> <b>formulation</b> are expected to better match the experimental data. Hertz theory does not hold when the material is heavily deform since contacts are not independent anymore. When investigating into a granular system of soft particles, nonlocal <b>contact</b> <b>formulation</b> is a more precise model. Further research may focus on the influence of particle size on the behavior of granular systems during compaction, especially when it reaches nano-scale...|$|E

30|$|The present paper now aims at {{developing}} a monolithic solution scheme for the thermo-elasto-plastic frictional contact problem {{based on a}} new approach. Mortar finite element methods with dual Lagrange multipliers are applied for the contact treatment using nonlinear complementarity functions to deal with both the inequality constraints arising from frictional contact as well as plasticity in a unified manner. This bears novelty both for the numerical formulation of anisotropic thermo-plasticity within the bulk material {{as well as for}} the fully nonlinear thermo-mechanical <b>contact</b> <b>formulation</b> at the interface. Furthermore, full compatibility of the algorithms for thermo-plasticity and thermo-mechanical contact is demonstrated. Concerning plasticity, an extension of [20] to coupled thermo-plasticity within a monolithic solution framework is presented. Similar to the isothermal case, the use of Gauss-point-wise decoupled plastic deformation allows for a condensation of the additionally introduced plastic unknowns, where now also thermo-mechanical coupling terms have to be accounted for. The novel thermo-mechanical <b>contact</b> <b>formulation</b> represents a fully nonlinear extension of [12] including a consistent linearization with respect to both the displacement and temperature unknowns. Moreover, the use of dual Lagrange multipliers within a mortar <b>contact</b> <b>formulation</b> enables the trivial condensation of the discrete contact Lagrange multipliers such that the final linearized system to be solved consists of displacement and temperature degrees of freedom only. Our new thermo-mechanical <b>contact</b> <b>formulation</b> is applicable for both classical finite elements based on Lagrange polynomial basis functions as well as isogeometric analysis using NURBS basis functions, for which an appropriate dual basis has recently been proposed in [22]. Owing to the variational basis of the mortar method, the thermo-mechanical contact patch test on non-matching discretizations is satisfied exactly and optimal convergence rates are achieved. Since this paper touches on various topics, and not every reader may be familiar with every single topic, we try to give a self-contained and rather detailed description of the different sub-problems and solution approaches. Even though this requires to some extent the repetition of methods developed elsewhere, we hope to thereby make the article and its novelties amenable to a broader audience.|$|E

In particular, the length scaling, or size effect, of the contact model is studied.

40|$|International audienceReducing the {{clearance}} between blade tips and casing {{is an important factor}} in increasing the performance of turbomachines such as turbofan engines. However, small clearances lead to more chances of rotor-stator contact, which can cause unstable vibrations. To improve the prediction of such contact-related phenomena, this paper proposes a model that includes potential contacts between the fan blade tips and their surrounding casing. This phenomenological model consists of a fully flexible bladed rotor and a flexible casing. The bladed rotor model is built according to the method developed by Lesaffre and based on the approximations used by Sinha [2]. The casing model is composed of an elastic ring with isotropic suspension. Two different <b>contact</b> <b>formulations</b> have been developed: a 3 D contact detection law, which incorporates 3 D model kinematics along with 3 D local geometry of the contact area, is compared to a simpler formulation.

Most studies on the node-to-surface <b>contact</b> <b>formulation,</b> however, have been conducted using solid elements and little has been done to investigate the effectiveness of this approach for beam or shell elements.

In addition, those algorithms satisfy the contact constraints exactly (at least in a weak sense) by using either Lagrange multipliers or an augmented Lagrangian functional instead of a simple penalty approach. Due to an easier implementation and other benefits like symmetric operators, most of the cited works above employ some sort of partitioned solution scheme for solving the structural problem (at constant temperature) and thermal problem (at constant displacement) sequentially. In thermo-plasticity, those partitioned schemes based on an isothermal split are only conditionally stable [13]. Only [4, 6, 11, 12] employ monolithic solution schemes, which solve for displacements and temperatures simultaneously. Most developments of advanced computational methods in thermo-mechanical contact are restricted to thermo-elastic effects; coupled thermo-elasto-plastic contact can only be found in [5 – 7].|$|R

In order to avoid mesh-dependencythe sensitivities are filtered by Sigmund’s filter. Thefinal LP-problem is solved by an interior point methodthat is available inMatlab.
