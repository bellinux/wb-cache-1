5|$|An {{important}} {{national conference}} was also {{held at the}} hotel by the American government in 1980. In the late 1980s a supposed secret meeting {{was held at the}} hotel by three Republicans—Richard V. Allen, Laurence H. Silberman and Robert McFarlane—with an Iranian emissary. From its opening until May 2005, the hotel was managed by Loews Hotels. For the next five years, it was managed by Crestline Hotels & Resorts, but the Davidson Hotel Company assumed <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> operations in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} May, David Ben-Gurion was {{convinced}} that the Arab Legion expected to take control of all Jerusalem. Moreover, after the fighting, the situation there deteriorated: the Jewish community had very small reserves of fuel, bread, sugar and tea, which would last for only 10 days, and water for 3 months. In Glubb's opinion, the aim was still to prevent the Israelis from reinforcing the city and taking <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> Arab part. On 29 May, the UN Security Council announced its intention to impose a ceasefire for 4 weeks, which would prevent further capture of territory and thus prevent resupplying the besieged city.|$|E
5|$|Central Area Command was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II. It was formed in March 1940, and covered the central portion of New South Wales. Headquartered at Sydney, Central Area Command was primarily responsible for air defence, aerial reconnaissance and protection of the sea lanes within its boundaries. It was disbanded in August 1941 and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> units taken over by other RAAF formations. Proposals in 1943–44 to raise a new Central Area Command did not come to fruition.|$|E

5|$|Cerebrates are {{secondary}} {{agents in}} the Zerg Swarm, each of which commands an individual brood of Zerg that possesses a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy. Alongside the Overmind, the cerebrates are the only Zerg with full sapience, {{each with its own}} personality and methods, although they are genetically incapable of disobeying the Overmind. Cerebrates can be reincarnated by the Overmind upon death, though dark templar energies are capable of preventing this. The death of a cerebrate causes the Overmind to lose <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> respective brood, which will then run amok.|$|E
5|$|Egypt's wealth, however, made it {{a tempting}} target for invasion, {{particularly}} by the Libyan Berbers to the west, and the Sea Peoples, a conjectured confederation of seafarers from the Aegean Sea. Initially, the military was able to repel these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> remaining territories in southern Canaan, much of it falling to the Assyrians. The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery, and civil unrest. After regaining their power, the high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and their expanded power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period.|$|E
5|$|George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester who {{had earlier}} praised Lang's work for church unity, said that Lang's failure {{to take a}} lead after the Prayer Book {{rejection}} of 1928 meant that the Church of England {{had been unable to}} revise its forms of worship or take any effective <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own affairs. Others have argued that Lang's laissez-faire approach to the Prayer Book controversy helped to defuse a potentially explosive situation and contributed to an eventual solution. Lang himself was gloomy about his legacy; he believed that since he had not led his country back into an Age of Faith, or marked his primacy with a great historical act, he had {{failed to live up to}} his own high standard. Others have judged him more charitably, praising his industry, his administrative ability and his devotion to duty.|$|E
50|$|The Psion Wavefinder was a {{computer}} peripheral for receiving {{digital audio broadcasting}} radio signals, made by Psion. It attached via USB to a personal computer, and had no loudspeakers or <b>controls</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own, with only a flashing light on the device. Psion hoped it would become a design classic.|$|R

50|$|When Texas was annexed {{into the}} United States in 1845, it kept <b>control</b> <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>its</b> public lands from its {{time as a}} {{sovereign}} state. As a result, Texas is the only US state to <b>control</b> all <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own public lands; all federal lands in Texas were acquired by purchase (e.g. military bases) or donation (e.g. national parks).|$|R
5|$|In Germany, {{there were}} major {{issues to be}} decided. Germany was still {{occupied}} by the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain and France. Dealing with the wartime allies was a major task for the high commissioner. West Germany, {{made up of the}} zones occupied by the three western powers, had been granted <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own affairs, except for defense and foreign policy, in 1949. While most Germans wanted a neutral and reunited Germany, the Eisenhower administration sought to reduce its defense spending by rearming Germany and replacing American troops with Germans. Meanwhile, the House Un-American Activities Committee slammed Conant's staff as communist sympathizers and called for books by communist authors held in United States Information Agency (USIA) libraries in Germany to be burned.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, {{the treaty}} pushed American {{diplomatic}} relations away from France and towards Great Britain, as the French government {{concluded that it}} violated the Franco-American treaty of 1778, and that the U.S. government had accepted the treaty against the overwhelming public sentiment against it. This set {{up a series of}} diplomatic and political conflicts over the ensuing four years, culminating in {{what became known as the}} Quasi-War. The Jay Treaty also helped ensure American <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own frontier lands. After the signing of treaty, the British withdrew their support from several Native Americans tribes, while the Spanish, fearing that the Jay Treaty signaled the creation of an Anglo-American alliance, sought to appease the United States.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford was Premier, {{but had not}} yet {{faced the}} people in an {{election}} and {{did not yet have}} a legislature to which he could propose legislation. Elections for the first Legislative Assembly of Alberta were accordingly fixed for November 9. The Conservatives, the young province's only other political party, had already selected R. B. Bennett as their leader. Bennett attacked the terms under which Alberta had been made a province, especially the clauses that left <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> lands and natural resources {{in the hands of the}} federal government and required the continued provincial funding of separate schools. He pointed out that Canada's older provinces had control of their own natural resources and that education was a provincial responsibility under the British North America Act. The Liberals responded to these criticisms by highlighting the financial compensation the province received from the federal government in exchange for <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> natural resources, which amounted to $375,000 per year. They further suggested that Conservative concern for control of lands was due to their desire to make favourable land concessions to the unpopular Canadian Pacific Railway, which had historically been friendly with the Conservatives, and for whom Bennett had acted as solicitor.|$|E
50|$|In 1914, he was Deputy Reeve of Oshawa and Reeve in 1915. In 1916-1917, Conant {{became the}} {{youngest}} Mayor of Oshawa. After his office he dedicated himself {{to the development of}} hydro-electric power in Ontario. Due to his efforts, Ontario gained <b>controlled</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own electrical system.

5|$|The musical {{style of}} The Book of Taliesyn {{is a mix}} of {{progressive}} rock, psychedelic rock and hard rock and different observers think that in this album the band is more mature and in greater <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own means of expression. Critics highlight how the compositions are generally longer and more complex than in their debut album. Deep Purple biographer Dave Thompson writes that a dark mood permeates The Book of Taliesyn with little indulgence to pop rock, citing influences of the American band The Doors in the original tracks written for this album.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} achieved {{surprise and}} much initial success. To counter the {{attack from the}} air, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) handed operational <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> XXIX Tactical Air Command and part of its Ninth Air Force, {{under the command of}} Major General Hoyt Vandenberg, to the RAF and Arthur Coningham. On 23 December, the RAF Second Tactical Air Force provided the American forces with much needed support, and helped prevent a German capture of Malmedy and Bastogne. This left the Germans with only the logistical bottleneck of St. Vith to support their operations. The German attack faltered.|$|E
5|$|The {{puzzle of}} how {{embryonic}} development was controlled {{began to be}} solved using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. The step-by-step <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> embryogenesis was visualized by attaching fluorescent dyes of different colours to specific types of protein made by genes expressed in the embryo. A dye such as green fluorescent protein, originally from a jellyfish, was typically attached to an antibody specific to a fruit fly protein, forming a precise indicator of where and when that protein appeared in the living embryo.|$|E

25|$|Polish–Ottoman War (1672–76) or the Second Polish–Ottoman War was a {{conflict}} between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire, as a precursor of the Great Turkish War.

Shortly after, Austria lost <b>control</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> Italian possessions. Maximilian then retired to Trieste, near which he built the castle Miramare.|$|R
5|$|After the war, Radford was a {{principal}} opponent {{to a plan}} to merge the uniformed services. A plan existed to split the Army and the Army Air Forces into separate branches and unite them and the Navy under one Cabinet-level defense organization. Fearing {{the loss of their}} branch's influence, Navy commanders opposed the formation of a separate Air Force and favored a more loose defense organization. Radford was picked by Forrestal to form the Secretary's Committee of Research and Reorganization. Months of discussion resulted in the National Security Act of 1947, a political victory for the Navy because it created the U.S. Air Force while resulting in a coordinated, not unified, U.S. Department of Defense with limited power and with the Navy maintaining <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> air assets. In 1947, Radford was briefly appointed commander of the Second Task Fleet, a move he felt was to distance him from the budget negotiations in Washington, but nonetheless preferred.|$|E
5|$|Al-Azhar was not {{unaffected}} by the 2011 Egyptian revolution that saw the removal of Hosni Mubarak as president of Egypt. Student government elections {{in the months following}} the revolution resulted in an overwhelming victory for the once banned Muslim Brotherhood. Protests demanding that the military junta ruling Egypt restore the mosque's independence from the state broke out, and the mosque itself commissioned the writing of a draft law that would grant al-Azhar greater independence from the government. Within al-Azhar, debate on its future and rightful role within the state has replaced what had been a mollified single-voice in support of the policies of the Mubarak regime. The various views on al-Azhar's future role in Egypt come from several parties, including leading Islamist organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood, liberal voices that wish to see al-Azhar stand as a bulwark against ultra-conservative Islamists (known as Salafists), and those that hope to see al-Azhar become wholly independent from the state and in complete <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> finances, leadership, and further that it be placed in charge of the religious ministries of the state.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1915, Bayer set up {{a number}} of shell {{corporations}} and subsidiaries in the United States, to hedge against the possibility of losing <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> American assets if the U.S. should enter the war and to allow Bayer to enter other markets (e.g., army uniforms). After the U.S. declared war on Germany in April 1917, alien property custodian A. Mitchell Palmer began investigating German-owned businesses, and soon {{turned his attention to}} Bayer. To avoid having to surrender all profits and assets to the government, Bayer's management shifted the stock to a new company, nominally owned by Americans but controlled by the German-American Bayer leaders. Palmer, however, soon uncovered this scheme and seized all of Bayer's American holdings. After the Trading with the Enemy Act was amended to allow sale of these holdings, the government auctioned off the Rensselaer plant and all Bayer's American patents and trademarks, including even the Bayer brand name and the Bayer cross logo. It was bought by a patent medicine company, Sterling Products, Inc.. The rights to Bayer Aspirin and the U.S. rights to the Bayer name and trademarks were sold back to Bayer AG in 1994 for US$1 billion.|$|E

5|$|Free traders, {{independent}} of the Hudson's Bay Company and outside its jurisdiction, developed extensive commerce with the United States, making Saint Paul the principal entrepôt and link {{to the outside world}} for the Selkirk Settlement. The trade developed by and along the trails connecting Fort Garry with Saint Paul stimulated commerce, contributed to the settlement of Minnesota and North Dakota in the United States, and accelerated the settlement of Canada {{to the west of the}} rugged barrier known as the Canadian Shield. For a time, this cross-border trade even threatened Canada's <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> western territories. The threat diminished after completion of transcontinental trade routes both north and south of the border, and the transportation corridor through which the trails once ran declined in importance. That corridor has now seen a resurgence of traffic, carried by more modern means of transport than the crude ox carts that once travelled the Red River Trails.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, in {{collaboration}} with numerous companies, Microsoft created a home computer system, MSX, which contained {{its own version of}} the DOS operating system, called MSX-DOS; this became relatively popular in Japan, Europe and South America. Later, the market saw a flood of IBM PC clones after Columbia Data Products successfully cloned the IBM BIOS, quickly followed by Eagle Computer and Compaq. The deal with IBM allowed Microsoft to have <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own QDOS derivative, MS-DOS, and through aggressive marketing of the operating system to manufacturers of IBM-PC clones Microsoft rose from a small player to one of the major software vendors in the home computer industry. With the release of the Microsoft Mouse on May 2, 1983, Microsoft continued to expand its product line in other markets. This expansion included Microsoft Press, a book publishing division, on July 11 the same year, which debuted with two titles: Exploring the IBM PCjr Home Computer by Peter Norton, and The Apple Macintosh Book by Cary Lu.|$|E
5|$|Insomniac had {{exclusively}} developed {{games for}} the PlayStation console until in 2010 when Insomniac announced its partnership with Electronic Arts via EA Partners to develop a multi-platform game for PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Studios' Xbox 360 console. The company hoped to reach a wider audience, while keeping the rights to its IP and retain full <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> franchises. The company revealed nothing about the game. The company established a new subsidiary called Insomniac Click, which focused on casual games and games for Facebook. Its first game was not set in any of Insomniac's existing franchises. Insomniac again partnered with Electronic Arts, which owned the popular casual game developer Playfish, to help the game to reach a broad audience. Outernauts was announced shortly after; it was released in July 2012 for browsers and mobile platforms. Click was later re-incorporated into Insomniac, and the browser version of Outernauts was canceled.|$|E
