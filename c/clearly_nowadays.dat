For, after all, the teachers and the preachers are but a little ahead of the age they live in. They see things earlier; they help to lead us up to them; but they do not wholly produce the revolutions they inaugurate. Humanity as a whole develops consistently along certain pre-established and predestined lines. Sooner or later, a certain point must inevitably be reached; but some of us reach it sooner, and most of us later. That's all the difference. Every great change is mainly {{due to the fact that}} we have all already attained a certain point in development. A step in advance becomes inevitable after that, and one after another we are sure to take it.

40|$|Chronic {{inflammation}} in asthma is a {{key feature}} {{of the disease and}} monitoring is an essential component of asthma management. Inflammation is present in both central and peripheral bronchi and can be measured by non invasive markers, such as fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). FeNO is increased in asthmatics, as compared to normal subjects and is lowered by inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with a dose-response relationship that is more evident for asthmatic patients with high levels of FeNO. FeNO measuring is easy to be performed in almost all patients including children and can be helpful as a tool contributing to asthma diagnosis and evaluation of the response to antinflammatory therapy with ICS. Smoking affects FeNO measurements and this has to be considered when evaluating patients with asthma who smoke. The different measurement of bronchial and alveolar FeNO can give information on the distribution of inflammation in the bronchial tree and is of particular interest for clinical pharmacology. Nonetheless, the clinical application of FeNO still needs to be clarified but it is <b>clearly</b> <b>nowadays</b> one of the most used non-invasive markers giving informatio...|$|E

40|$|This article, {{which serves}} as the {{introduction}} to the special issue focusing on 'wages and employment', deals with the key developments of the past 25 years in this area of research. First, the latest insights and findings of macro- and microeconomic theory as well as of empirical knowledge on the explanation and quantification of the relationship between wage level, wage structure and employment as well as of employment structure are the centre of attention, with the relevant progress in econometry also being acknowledged. Then, the importance of wage rigidities is dealt with, which are significant both from a macro- and a microeconomic point of view, and which have been at the centre of scientific and economic-policy discussions particularly in recent years. Finally, wage-policy conclusions are examined briefly. What becomes obvious is that a negative relationship between wages and employment can be detected far more <b>clearly</b> <b>nowadays</b> {{than a quarter of a}} century ago. This is equally true on the basis of theoretical and empirical analysis with a micro- and macroeconomic background, even if, when based on disequilibrium models, for the latter no positive employment effects due to reductions in real wages can be expected in times of recession.

They are <b>clearly</b> oriented <b>nowadays</b> on the multi-point conversion, based on a parallel high voltage bus, with photovoltaic panels owner of their individual Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) connected to an integrated DC-DC converter managing a global Maximum Power Point. This structure allows to avoid shadowing problems. We have studied in this paper the possibility to have a small universal DC-DC converter able {{to work in a}} large input voltage range (10 - 40 volts), and producing an output voltage up to around 300 volts with a global efficiency better than 96 %.

40|$|Abstract. The {{obligations}} that telecommunications providers have with their customers are <b>nowadays</b> <b>clearly</b> specified in SLA contracts. The offered availability during the contract period {{is one of}} the most relevant variables in SLAs. Modeling accurately the transient solution posed by the need of considering the interval availability is still an open challenge. A common policy taken to make simpler models is the use of steady state assumptions. Nevertheless, this simplification may put on risk the contract fulfillment as stochastic variations of the measured availability are significant over a typical contract period. This paper makes a theoretical study of the interval availability and propose an approximation to evaluate the cumulative downtime distribution of a system component using renewal theory. We study the evolution of the distribution of the interval availability with the increase of the observation period i. e., duration of the contract, and show its respective impact in the SLA success probability. In addition, using the approximation proposed, we analyze numerically the behavior of the cumulative downtime distribution and the SLA risk under processes that do not follow Markovian assumptions. ...|$|R

Here, every way-side tree felled is an irreparable loss to the epiphytic lichen communities, every acre of heath burnt or turned into arable land is a blow to our stock of terrestrial lichen species, whereas the use of dry fertilisers and the spraying of orchards are very effective in killing any lichen in the neighbourhood that otherwise might have survived.

This study aimed to determine the predictive value of cough for concomitant asthma in patients suffering from upper airway diseases. MethodsThis cross-sectional study described a group of 143 consecutive patients suffering simultaneously from common upper and lower airway disorders.

40|$|Background. Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) type 1 is {{an important}} contributor to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among younger transplant recipients. However, {{little is known about}} the changes in epidemiological characteristics of this population. Especially, time to reach ESRD may have changed in type 1 diabetic patients referred for transplantation, resulting in higher age at time of grafting. Such time trends may allow anticipating future developments regarding the demand for organ replacement in this patient group. Methods. We retrospectively analysed 173 patients with type 1 [*]DM undergoing renal transplantation at our institution, stratified into four groups according to year of reaching ESRD (A = 1973 - 1983, B = 1984 - 1990, C = 1991 - 1995 and D = 1996 - 2002). For each group we determined age at diagnosis of DM, age at time of reaching ESRD and age at time of transplantation. From these data, the interval from diagnosis of DM to ESRD and from ESRD to transplantation was calculated. The results were analysed in relation to gender, year of and age at onset of diabetes. Results. Patients reaching ESRD in more recent years (group D) tended to be both younger at diagnosis of DM and older when reaching ESRD, resulting in higher mean age at transplantation (35. 0, 37. 5, 39. 6 and 41. 0 years in groups A, B, C and D, respectively). Accordingly, median duration to ESRD has significantly been prolonged over the last five decades in patients with type 1 [*]DM undergoing renal transplantation (group A: 21. 0, B: 20. 7, C: 22. 3 and D: 28. 5 years; P< 0. 0001), this finding being more pronounced in female patients. Conclusions. The results of our analysis are compatible with a change in epidemiology in patients undergoing kidney transplantation. Older age at time of reaching ESRD may impact significantly on the demand for renal grafts, as patients are already <b>clearly</b> older <b>nowadays</b> when being transplanted. From our data it cannot be concluded whether this development is due to a change in the progression of diabetic nephropathy or may simply reflect a change in the selection of type 1 diabetic patients referred for transplantatio...|$|R

One of the difficulties frequently encountered is that such systems display emergence, i. e. their global effect or behavior is greater than the sum of the behaviors of their agents and depends strongly on the interactions between these agents. Simulation is a very interesting approach for this study, since it allows focusing on the dynamic study of the system, thus pointing out these behaviors and interactions. Moreover, it is particularly interesting for aerospace systems, which are <b>nowadays</b> <b>clearly</b> studied as complex systems, since these systems are generally poor candidates for real experimentation, due to many diverse reasons (e. g. cost for space systems, criticality in terms of human life for air transport systems, etc.).

Moreover its wear out must also be known in order to replace it when necessary. Li-ion batteries have provided many advantages over their predecessors. They provide a higher voltage, they are lighter and the energy density with respect to their weight and volume is much higher. This project aims to estimate the actual remaining battery charge through temperature variations that occur inside the battery both during charging and discharging. The aim is to find a simple and cheap solution, which does not require external elements. For this reason, temperature measurements are carried out using a thermistor that is already present in lithium batteries. At present, its purpose is to avoid overheating.

From measurements of current, voltage and temperature we calculated the internal resistance, the heat flow inside the battery and the thermal impedance. It has been shown {{that it is possible to}} relate temperature variations, current and voltage to the heat generated in the battery. Thus, it is possible to estimate the state of charge of the battery (SoC) from temperature fluctuations. In addition, consecutive charge and discharge cycles were carried out.

40|$|Published in: Origin Spatial Development of Contemporary Poland in Łódź University Geographical Research, {{edited by}} T. MarszałThe last 20 years of {{scientific}} research on metropolises and metropolitan areas in Poland {{can be divided into}} three basic stages. The first one, observed {{at the turn of the}} 20 th century, focused on the implementation of the basic terminology and methodology from European and American scientific literature. That was also the time of the first attempts of identify Polish metropolises and delimit their functional areas. This period strongly influenced further achievements in this field, first of all, two basic approaches towards understanding the metropolis were applied then. The first one, according to the international terminology, refers to a big city which due to well-developed metropolitan functions is considered (or aspires) to be an important centre on the global scale (global metropolis). In Poland only the capital city, Warsaw, to some extent seems to meet such criteria. In such circumstances, this term more and more often was used to refer also to other regional and supra-regional centres. As a result, scientists who certainly acknowledged this nuance, began to equate “metropolitan areas” with “urban agglomerations”. The popularity of this approach could be explained in the context of prestige and political objectives. However, despite the fact that for many years numerous attempts to institutionalize such metropolitan areas have been made, still there is no agreement on the identification of metropolises and the delimitation of their functional areas, not mentioning other issues related to metropolitan governance. The second stage of research in the described field fell on the first decade of the 21 st century. The main focus was on identification of metropolitan functions in the biggest Polish cities, usually four or five of them. At that time a dual approach towards the understanding the idea of metropolis was <b>clearly</b> visible. <b>Nowadays</b> we experience the third stage of metropolitan research, in which the internal structure of metropolitan areas as well as the relations within them attract scientific attention. Simultaneously, numerous projects focusing on smaller territorial units (e. g. small towns located in metropolitan hinterland) are being carried out. It seems that in future this stage could be followed by focusing the interest on the institutionalisation of metropolitan areas. This ought to result in integration of transport policies, land management and performing other municipal tasks, and, in a broader perspective, in establishing complex metropolitan management. The example of considerable advancement in this field may already be found in Poznań, where local authorities, together with the scientific circ les, successfully stimulate integration of the metropolitan area. To conclude, metropolises and metropolitan areas are nowadays among the most important scientific research subjects in Poland. Not only does this refer to socio-economic geography, but also to economy, urban sociology and management. A considerable share of the scientific projects in this field has application values – their results are implemented in various planning documents prepared at each level of territorial organisation. This evidently proves the importance of research activities regarding metropolisation processes as well as the necessity of their continuation in future...|$|R

The writer was encouraged to investigate the kinds of input provided by the natives and non-natives and their strategies to make such input comprehensible since such investigation can give good contribution to the field of teaching strategies. She carried out her investigation on native speaker subjects at English First Surabaya and non-native speaker subjects at Friendship English Course Surabaya. She used the observation method of qualitative research and played her role as participant observer by joining the English classes as a real student. The writer has spent 4 months to carry out the investigation. She investigated the first native speaker subject by joining his eight-week Easy English class and then continued to investigate the second native speaker subject during her four-week conversation class. After that, the writer investigated the non-native speaker subjects by joining their conversation class which was hold for 12 meeting fours in a month. From the results of the investigation, the writer was able o find out the same kinds of input (visual, verbal, aural and written input) presented by all subjects to the students in the classroom. She also found four kinds of strategies used to make the input comprehensible and the responses given by the students during the presentation of each input. After that she found that the native speakers can make visual, verbal and aural input more comprehensible, while the non-native speakers can make the written input more comprehensible. From all of this, the writer can conclude that there are some strategies that can really make the input comprehensible and also some that failed to make input comprehensible. Besides, such strategies can work well if the learner are categorized in the same level of competence...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{magnetism}} {{is responsible}} for the several active phenomena that occur in the solar atmosphere. The consequences of these phenomena on the solar-terrestrial environment and on Space Weather are <b>nowadays</b> <b>clearly</b> recognized, even if not yet fully understood. In order to shed light on the mechanisms that are at the basis of the Space Weather, it is necessary to investigate the sequence of phenomena starting in the solar atmosphere and developing across the outer layers of the Sun and along the path from the Sun to the Earth. This goal can be reached by a combined multi-disciplinary, multi-instrument, multi-wavelength study of these phenomena, starting with the very first manifestation of solar active region formation and evolution, followed by explosive phenomena (i. e., flares, erupting prominences, coronal mass ejections), and ending with the interaction of plasma magnetized clouds expelled from the Sun with the interplanetary magnetic field and medium. This wide field of research constitutes one of the main aims of COST Action ES 0803 : Developing Space Weather products and services in Europe. In particular, one of the tasks of this COST Action was to investigate the Progress in Scientific Understanding of Space Weather. In this paper we review {{the state of the art}} of our comprehension of some phenomena that, in the scenario outlined above, might have a role on Space Weather, focusing on the researches, thematic reviews, and main results obtained during the COST Action ES 0803.
