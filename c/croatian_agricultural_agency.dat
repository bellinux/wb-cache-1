40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the microclimatic conditions in stables in three climactic regions (East, Mediterranean, and Central) of Croatia as well as to evaluate the effect of temperature-humidity index (THI) values on the daily production of dairy cattle. With that purpose, 1675686 test-day records collected from January 2005 until April 2010 were extracted from HPA (<b>Croatian</b> <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Agency)</b> database. For estimation of the effect of THI on daily production of dairy cows fixed-effect model that took into account the effects of lactation stage, breed, calving season, measuring season, and THI group (T 1 - THI≤ 72; T 2 - THI> 72) was used. Model was applied to each class of parity (P 1, P 2, P 3, P 4 and P 5) and region. During the analysed period, the highest monthly averages of ambient temperature were determined in Mediterranean region, the highest monthly averages of relative humidity were observed in Central region, while the highest monthly mean values of temperature-humidity index (THI) were determined in Mediterranean region. Heat stress conditions indicated with mean daily values of THI> 72 were determined during spring and summer season in all analysed regions. Absence of heat stress conditions during autumn and winter season also characterised all three regions. Highly significant (P< 0. 01) decrease of daily milk yield as well as of daily fat and protein content due to enhanced THI was observed in all cows regardless the parity class and in all three climatic regions. Furthermore, the most deteriorate effect of heat stress was observed in East region. During heat stress period, with the aim of minimization of the effects of heat stress, it is necessary to regulate management strategies in the dairy herd...|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of a questionnaire that included 418 peasants proportionately distributed in four <b>Croatian</b> <b>agricultural</b> regions. The researchers estimate that most of the respondents belonged to the 10 - 15 per cent Croatian peasants with above-average land acreage, yonger and better educated, more ambitious in production and entrepreneurship. These are peasants who have most need of an agricultural advisory service, and through which such a Service can best implement its function of advancing Croatian family agriculture. Research focused around the experiences of peasants in using the Public Advisory Service and what they expect from that service in the future. The most important results show that Service advisors have to date provided technical and agricultural-technology advice more often than peasants asked for it, while peasants asked for advice on economic and legal issues more frequently than this advice was available. As for peasants’ future expectations from the Service, economic questions continued in the foreground (the possibility of obtaining credits, advice on marketing their products, and on more favourable purchase of production materials), but there was also interest in technological advice. In that sense peasants from various <b>Croatian</b> <b>agricultural</b> regions show more similarities than differences...|$|R
