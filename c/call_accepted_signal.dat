40|$|A vast {{majority}} of communications in a network occurs between pairs of nodes, each such interaction is termed a call. The job of call control algorithm is to decide which {{of a set of}} <b>calls</b> to <b>accept</b> in the network so as to maximize a certain objective, viz., the number of <b>accepted</b> <b>calls</b> or the profit associated with the <b>accepted</b> <b>calls.</b> When a <b>call</b> is <b>accepted</b> it uses up some network resources, like bandwidth, along the path through which it is routed. Thus, the call control algorithm needs to make intelligent trade-offs between resource constraints and profits. In this paper, we investigate two variants of call control problems on ring networks; in the first, the algorithm is allowed to determine the route connecting the end nodes of a call, while in the second, the route is specified as part of the input. For the first variant, we show an efficient algorithm that achieves the objective of routing and maximizing the nrnber of <b>accepted</b> <b>calls</b> within an additive constant of at most 3 to an optimal algorithm. This yields by-product. For the fixed path variant, we derive a 2 -approximation for maximizing the profits (which could be arbitrary) of <b>accepted</b> <b>calls...</b>|$|R

Traditional analog computers and transfer function analyzers built using the binary rate multiplier principle did not explicitly consider negative numbers. It is proposed to introduce a two-pin {{system in which the}} sign of the variable is made available as 1 -bit data on one pin and a series of pulses, whose frequency is proportional to the magnitude of the variable on another pin. Using this concept, the binary rate multiplier had been redesigned to <b>accept</b> <b>signals</b> of both the polarities. Integrators can be constructed, feedback of a variable can be realized and summing operation could be performed easily using this new representation...|$|R
