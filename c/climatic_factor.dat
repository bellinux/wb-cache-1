50|$|The {{amount and}} {{intensity}} of precipitation is the main <b>climatic</b> <b>factor</b> governing soil erosion by water. The relationship is particularly strong if heavy rainfall occurs at times when, or in locations where, the soil's surface is not well protected by vegetation. This might be during periods when agricultural activities leave the soil bare, or in semi-arid regions where vegetation is naturally sparse. Wind erosion requires strong winds, particularly during times of drought when vegetation is sparse and soil is dry (and so is more erodible). Other climatic factors such as average temperature and temperature range may also affect erosion, via their effects on vegetation and soil properties. In general, given similar vegetation and ecosystems, areas with more precipitation (especially high-intensity rainfall), more wind, or more storms {{are expected to have}} more erosion.|$|E
40|$|An {{epidemiological}} study {{was carried out}} to explore the relationship between <b>climatic</b> <b>factors</b> and non-specific low-back and neck-shoulder symptoms in working populations. In a review of published literature, 27 studies were found which related <b>climatic</b> <b>factors</b> to musculoskeletal symptoms, {{but none of these}} studies specifically addressed the subject. It can be concluded that a relationship between <b>climatic</b> <b>factors</b> and musculoskeletal symptoms is considered at least plausible by both researchers, workers and patients, but that the epidemiological evidence appearing from literature is very weak. Questionnaire data which were collected on musculoskeletal symptoms, workload and perceptions of climatic conditions of 2030 workers in 24 different occupations were analysed multivariately. About one-quarter of the workers related symptoms of the low back and neck-shoulders to <b>climatic</b> <b>factors.</b> They perceived <b>climatic</b> <b>factors</b> in most cases as aggravating factors for their symptoms. No seasonal influence on prevalence rates was reported. For low-back and neck-shoulder symptoms and for sick leave due to neck-shoulder symptoms, an association was found with <b>climatic</b> <b>factors,</b> and in particular with respect to draughts in relation to neck-shoulder symptoms. In addition, neck-shoulder symptoms were negatively related to frequent outdoor work.

40|$|For {{understanding}} {{to what extent}} the relationship between <b>climatic</b> <b>factors</b> and surface runoff been distorted by human activities, this study investigated the relationships between <b>climatic</b> <b>factors,</b> human activities and natural and measured runoff in the Weihe River drainage basin. The results show that the average annual natural runoff of the river during 1988 - 2008 decreased by 45 % from that during 1956 1987, of which 33. 0 %, 15. 9 % and 51. 1 % were contributed by precipitation, temperature and human activities, respectively. Human activities played a more important role in this change. Nevertheless, the <b>climatic</b> <b>factors</b> can explain about 80 % of deviation of measured runoff, which means the variation of measure runoff is highly consistent with climate change. The main {{reason for this is that}} the impact mechanisms of human activities and <b>climatic</b> <b>factors</b> on local runoff are different. Human activities, mainly water diversion, change the runoff by consuming the annual water resource in quantity. Although this may represent 50 % or higher of the annual natural runoff, it can hardly change the long-term runoff trend, because water diversion itself is also partly controlled by climate. <b>Climatic</b> <b>factors</b> not only affect annual runoff quantity, but also control the long-term runoff variation, even if a large amount of natural runoff was consumed by humans. Therefore, the regression relationship between runoff and <b>climatic</b> <b>factors</b> can hardly be affected by human activities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{determine}} the effect of <b>climatic</b> <b>factors</b> (temperature, relative humidity and rainfall) on mosquito abundance and to map mosquito larva breeding sites using GIS application in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. The data pertaining to larval and adult mosquito abundance/distribution and <b>climatic</b> <b>factors</b> were collected for the study period of 2014. Bi-variate and multivariate analyses were performed {{to determine}} the relationship between mosquito abundance and <b>climatic</b> <b>factors</b> (temperature, relative humidity and rainfall). The utilization of GIS with GPS facilitates to identify and map larva breeding sites in the study area. The result showed strong negative correlation between mosquito abundance and temperature while there appeared a strong positive correlation with relative humidity and moderate positive correlation with rainfall. Low mosquito abundance was observed at high temperatures whereas high and moderate mosquito abundance was observed at high humidity and during rainy months, respectively. In the adult mosquito, the regression model for three <b>climatic</b> <b>factors</b> (temperature, RH and rainfall) and other factors showed a variation of 84. 5 % of the variance accounted for the <b>climatic</b> <b>factors</b> while the remaining 15. 5 % were attributed to other factors.

40|$|TITLE INFLUENCE OF <b>CLIMATIC</b> <b>FACTOR</b> FOR LANDSLIDES FORMATION ABSTRACT Slope {{movements}} {{are divided into}} several groups, either by speed, method of movement or by factors causing their formation. The climate conditions of different territories {{are one of the}} main reasons that significantly affect the formation of slope movements. The most important climate factor that causes slope movements is precipitation. However, the effect of freezing soil can also be included here because water in the soil changes its volume and after thawing changing geomechanical properties of the material. In this work, the impact of precipitation will be discussed as the most significant <b>climatic</b> <b>factor</b> that induces breaking of the slopes. Rainwater can either gradually infiltrate into the slope, or can infiltrate in the single event with a high amount of rainfall, until it reaches a critical stage during which the weight of watered zone together with pore pressure are being increased whereas the effective shear strength is being reduced. This causes subsequent disintegration of the slope and movement of material along the slip surface in case of sliding movements and along the native surface in case of debris flows. This work summarizes the available knowledge about the precipitation as a significant factor which affects the [...] ...|$|E
