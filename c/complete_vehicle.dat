25|$|During {{a period}} of {{significant}} postwar reconstruction, migrant assimilation and technical innovation, the factory employed a peak of 7000 people from 35 nations. The only plant in Australia to manufacture the <b>complete</b> <b>vehicle,</b> it introduced to Australia the in-line transfer machining of engine blocks, the “rotodip” paint process, automatic conveyor assembly processes and major advances in just-in-time and flexible manufacturing concepts.|$|E

As it was found to be in sound condition, capable of running on arrival, it was instead decided to repair the collision damage and restore it as a <b>complete</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Oporto 176 was instead acquired for their spare part needs.|$|E
25|$|The {{assembly}} of the vehicles began on {{the day when the}} joint venture contract was signed. SamAuto provides their assembly plant in Samarkand. One of the currently assembled models is the MAN TGA which is delivered as a CKD kit from Germany. Another model is the identical truck called MAN CLA which is made by the Indian MAN Force Trucks Pvt. Ltd. This units are also delivered as a CKD kit. According to plans of MAN they want to build 500 up to 1000 units annual. For the sales of the vehicles, UzAvtosanoat had established a separate dealer network. The production capacity is expected to rise later to more than 2000 units. MAN have plans to introducing the Indian CLA model version in a modified version especially for the Central Asian market called the MAN CLE. So the target markets for the Uzbek manufactured models is the Uzbek domestic market for itself and all markets of the CIS states. Some used vehicles are exported to Uzbekistan for the strategic market support as a <b>complete</b> <b>vehicle</b> by the Neuhaus GmbH located in Selm. In addition to the TGA and the CLA series there are also the TGA TGM series and the obsolete models MAN F2000, MAN M2000 and MAN F8 available.|$|E

2500|$|The Melbourne Motor Omnibus Co Ltd was {{the first}} motor bus {{operator}} in Melbourne. The business was formed to introduce motor buses in Melbourne. The business commenced operations with the importing of a Daimler CC bus from England {{where it would be}} put to exhaustive tests under local conditions. The bus would hold 20 persons inside and 14 to 16 on the upper deck. The bus was to be imported as a <b>complete</b> <b>vehicle,</b> with the idea being that in future buses would be imported in cab chassis configuration with local Australian coach builders able to make the bus body following the example from the test vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|In guided {{missiles}} {{where the}} fins {{can be moved}} to trim the vehicles in different angles of attack, the center of pressure {{is the center of}} pressure of the flow field at that angle of attack for the undeflected fin position. [...] This is the center of pressure of any small change in the angle of attack (as defined above). [...] Once again for positive static stability, this definition of center of pressure requires that the center of pressure be further from the nose than the center of gravity. [...] This ensures that any increased forces resulting from increased angle of attack results in increased restoring moment to drive the missile back to the trimmed position. [...] In missile analysis, positive static margin implies that the <b>complete</b> <b>vehicle</b> makes a restoring moment for any angle of attack from the trim position.|$|E
