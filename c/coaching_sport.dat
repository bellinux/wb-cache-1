40|$|An {{ecological}} perspective {{has been}} utilized {{to understand the}} teaching-learning context in physical education and sport settings, yet few studies have systematically studied the teacher/coach in their dual role context teaching and coaching (Hastie 2 ̆ 6 Siedentop, 1999). The {{purpose of this study}} was twofold. First, to examine the work of an exemplary physical education teacher/coach teaching soccer in physical education and coaching soccer in sport from Doyle 2 ̆ 7 s (1977) ecological perspective. Specifically, to understand the similarities and difference of the program of action (PoA), during lesson and practice sessions. Second to examine, from Callero 2 ̆ 7 s (1994) resource perspective of role, how dual role responsibilities influenced the work of a physical education teacher/coach. Participants included Tom, a 34 -year veteran physical education teacher/coach and his physical education class (N = 14), and varsity boy 2 ̆ 7 s soccer team (N = 23). Data were collected at 15 physical education classes and 31 soccer practices using qualitative techniques (e. g., narrative field notes, in-depth participant interviews). Three formal semi-structured 90 minute interviews were conducted with the teacher/coach to explore his background, perceptions and beliefs about teaching and coaching, and his work as a dual role professional. Semi-structured 30 -minute student/athlete interviews were conducted with seven students and 21 athletes and focused on their experiences in sport and physical education with Tom. Data were analyzed inductively using a constant comparison method. Findings indicate that for Tom there was a similarity and compatibility of teaching physical education and <b>coaching</b> <b>sport</b> based on how Tom claimed the teaching and coaching role. Second, reverence among student/athletes and Tom was a powerful resource Tom accessed through the teaching and coaching role, which facilitated relationship building and contributed to a positive learning environment. Finally, Tom structured the learning environments in physical education and sport with robust PoAs, which included a strong primary learning vector. Tom used many appropriate pedagogical practices in both physical education and sport, such as effective rules, routines, expectations, and strong content development through the four games stages (Rink, 1998) which contributed to the robustness of the PoA. This study was an important step in the systematic examination of the practices of exemplary physical education teacher/coaches. ...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{offers an}} {{understanding}} of the roles of high performance directors and the management processes that allow high performance sport to take place. These processes entail the ways leadership occurs in a high performance environment to ensure positive team and athlete culture, teamwork and success. The chapter is {{based on the results of}} a qualitative study on the roles and responsibilities of high performance directors and represents an effort to enhance the performance of leaders and managers in elite sport. High performance sport is characterised by the effective amalgamation and synergy of elements including financial and managerial support, <b>coaching,</b> <b>sport</b> sciences and sport medicine support, talent identification and athlete pathways, training facilities and equipment, and competitions. Nations are becoming more strategic in the way they produce elite athletes (De Bosscher et al., 2008). Consequently, national sport systems have moved beyond the mere application of sport sciences and coaching as a sole base for elite athlete success. There is a rapid recognition and overwhelming evidence to suggest that the 'new' point of difference and competitive advantage for nations is effective management and governance (e. g., Bayle & Robinson, 2007; Chelladurai, 2007; Ferkins, Shilbury, & McDonald, 2005; Hoye, 2007; Hoye & Cuskelly, 2007) of high performance sport and all the processes involved. Unquestionably, high performance sport and its management is a rapidly expanding profession in many countries around the world. High performance sport management is a billion-dollar industry, and one that continues to grow in size and sophistication. Although the number of athletes represented at this level of performance is marginal compared to the overall population, the number of stakeholders involved with high performance sport (e. g., specialising coaches, team directors, performance managers, administrators, sport agencies, sport organizations, individuals and beneficiaries, sponsors and media, governments and government agencies at all levels, academics and researchers, facility managers, team owners, athlete agents, sports and other scientists) is increasingly expanding to an industry that is becoming largely compound (Sotiriadou & Shilbury, 2009). That expansion drives the need for a core of full-time experts to provide specialised administrative skills in response to the increasingly commercialised and professionalised high performance sport industry (Jones, Brooks, & Mak, 2008). A similar trend occurred during the early 1990 s when the growing complexity of sport led to an urgent need to upgrade the quality of sports administration through well-trained and educated sport managers (Shilbury & Kellett, 2011). The increased professionalism of sports and sport management practices since the early 1980 s led to the introduction of sport management tertiary programs across many countries (Sotiriadou, 2011). Now specialization is taken one step further to introduce modules and courses on high performance sport management and the new generation of graduates is becoming equipped for this trend. Although the field of sport management has been widely defined, the newly emerged concept of high performance sport management is in its infancy and its characteristics are far from clear. This chapter is the result of a study on high performance sport and high performance directors in an effort to respond to the need to fill this gap in an expanding field. The chapter acts as a vehicle for clarifying the concept of high performance sport management and the roles of high performance directors in elite sport.
