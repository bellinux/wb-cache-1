Since the total mass of the working fluid remains constant, the instantaneous cyc-pressure was computated by the characteristic gas equation. The differential pressure vector of the expansion space between the compression space was computated by the flow loss in the regenerator. The instantaneous current of generator winding was computated by the balance equation of motional electromotive force.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 A {{computational}} {{model for a}} resonantly coupled alpha free-piston Stirling cooler is presented. The cooler consists of two isothermal working spaces for compression and expansion connected by a regenerator consisting of a stack of narrow parallel channels. The regenerator is assumed to have a linear temperature distribution along its axial direction and the working fluid is taken as an ideal gas. Control volume analysis is adapted in this model, in which each {{of the components of}} the cooler is considered a separate control volume. The <b>compression</b> <b>piston</b> is given a predetermined motion to provide the work needed by the cooler. The expansion piston and the gas trapped between the piston and the walls of the expansion cylinder are modeled as a mass, spring, and damper system. The motion of the <b>compression</b> <b>piston</b> generates a pressure difference across the cooler, and forces the working fluid to pass through the regenerator. The expansion piston responds to the pressure in its space according to Newton's second law of motion. The motion of the expansion piston is governed by the forces originating from the pressure and the cold side gas spring and dash-pot. In this way the dynamics of the moving pistons are coupled to the thermodynamics of the cooler system. A definition for the coefficient of performance (COP) that considers the heat transfer by conduction through the material making up the regenerator is introduced. This definition of the COP reflects the dependence of the cooler's performance on the length of the regenerator. From a systematic variation of this regenerator length, an optimal value can be found for a given set of operating parameters. Conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy along with ideal gas relations are used to form a set of equations fully describing the motion of the pistons and the thermal state of the cooler. A marching-in-time technique with a Runge-Kutta scheme of the fourth order is adapted to integrate the equation of motion. The plots of the motion of the pistons, the pressure-volume diagrams of the workspaces and the COP plots are provided to describe the cooler behavior...|$|E

40|$|Methanol is an {{alternative}} fuel offering a lower well-to-wheel CO 2 emission {{as well as a}} higher efficiency, given that the fuel is derived from biomass. In addition to reduced CO 2, methanol does not emit soot particles when combusted which is a great advantage when attempting to reduce NOX levels due to the effectively non-existing NOX-soot trade-off. The engine setup used was a Scania D 13 engine modified to run on one cylinder, utilizing a high <b>compression</b> <b>piston</b> with a rc of 27 : 1. This study analyzes the effects of four control parameters on gross indicated efficiency and the indicated specific emissions; CO, THC and NOX. The control parameters chosen in this work was common rail pressure (PRAIL), EGR, λ and CA 50, running at 6 bar IMEPG and 1200 rpm. The effects of the control parameters on performance and emissions was analyzed using a surface response method of the Box-Behnken type. Predictive mathematical models were obtained from regression analysis performed on the responses from the experiments. The highest gross indicated efficiency achieved was ∼ 53 %, when a high level of EGR was applied together with the combustion phasing set to its low level at CA 50 = 6 CAD ATDC. The control parameters influencing the CO emissions are λ and the interaction between PRAIL and λ, while THC is only controlled by PRAIL and EGR. NOX emissions was, as expected, influenced mainly by EGR and λ, although PRAIL and CA 50 also had minor effects. The effect of increased PRAIL, increased THC emissions which in its turn reduced the gross indicated efficiency. Throughout the experiment, THC concentration never decreased below ∼ 150 ppm due to utilization of high rc in combination with the volatility of methanol. It was also concluded that a rc = 27 is rather high if operation flexibility is required, especially at the higher load range...|$|E
