40|$|Due to its {{storage and}} {{retrieval}} efficiency, cross-modal hashing~(CMH) {{has been widely}} used for cross-modal similarity search in multimedia applications. According to the training strategy, existing CMH methods can be mainly divided into two categories: relaxation-based <b>continuous</b> <b>methods</b> and discrete methods. In general, the training of relaxation-based <b>continuous</b> <b>methods</b> is faster than discrete methods, but the accuracy of relaxation-based <b>continuous</b> <b>methods</b> is not satisfactory. On the contrary, the accuracy of discrete methods is typically better than relaxation-based <b>continuous</b> <b>methods,</b> but the training of discrete methods is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel CMH method, called discrete latent factor model based cross-modal hashing~(DLFH), for cross modal similarity search. DLFH is a discrete method which can directly learn the binary hash codes for CMH. At the same time, the training of DLFH is efficient. Experiments on real datasets show that DLFH can achieve significantly better accuracy than existing methods, and the training time of DLFH is {{comparable to that of}} relaxation-based <b>continuous</b> <b>methods</b> which are much faster than existing discrete methods...|$|R

50|$|During the dry roasting process, peanuts can be dried {{by either}} the batch or <b>continuous</b> <b>method.</b> In the batch method, peanuts are heated in large {{quantities}} in a revolving oven at about 426.6℃. Next, the peanuts in each batch are uniformly held and roasted in the oven at 160℃ for about 40 to 60 minutes. This method is good to use when the peanuts differ in moisture content.

The peanuts continuously pass through a hot air roaster in a rocking motion. This allows for even roasting of the peanuts. Also, this method can lower spoilage rate; it doesn't require much labor-intensive, and therefore, many large industries prefer to use <b>continuous</b> <b>method</b> in the dry roasting process.

40|$|Order {{release is}} a key {{component}} of the Workload Control concept. Jobs do not enter the shop floor directly – they are retained in a pre-shop pool and released in time to meet due dates while keeping work-in-process within limits or norms. There are two important groups of release methods: <b>continuous</b> <b>methods,</b> for which the workload falling to a specified level can trigger a release at any moment in time; and, periodic release methods, for which releases take place at fixed intervals. <b>Continuous</b> release <b>methods</b> in general have been shown to outperform periodic release methods. Yet, there is incongruence in the results presented in the literature on the relative performance of the various <b>continuous</b> release <b>methods.</b> We use a job shop simulation model to examine the performance of <b>continuous</b> release <b>methods</b> from the literature and find that the contradictory results are explained by the different rules applied to sequence jobs in the pool – a factor neglected in previous work. Finally, a new breed of <b>continuous</b> release <b>methods</b> has recently emerged, but these have not been compared with prior approaches. Therefore, we also examine these methods and show that they significantly improve overall performance, although this is to the detriment of jobs with large processing times...|$|R
40|$|Several {{formulations}} {{and methods}} used in solving an NP-hard discrete optimization problem, maximum clique, are considered in a dynamical system perspective proposing <b>continuous</b> <b>methods</b> to the problem. A compact form for a saturated linear dynamical network, recently developed for obtaining approximations to maximum clique, is given so {{its relation to}} the classical gradient projection method of constrained optimization becomes more visible. Using this form, gradient-like dynamical systems as <b>continuous</b> <b>methods</b> for finding the maximum clique are discussed. To show the one to one correspondence between the stable equilibria of the saturated linear dynamical network and the minima of objective function related to the optimization problem, La Salle's invariance principle has been extended to the systems with a discontinuous right-hand side. In order to show {{the efficiency of the}} <b>continuous</b> <b>methods</b> simulation results are given comparing saturated the linear dynamical network, the continuous Hopfield network, the cellular neural networks and relaxation labelling networks. It is concluded that the quadratic programming formulation of the maximum clique problem provides a framework suitable to be incorporated with the continuous relaxation of binary optimization variables and hence allowing the use of gradient-like continuous systems which have been observed to be quite efficient for minimizing quadratic costs. © Springer-Verlag 1999...|$|R

40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the depth of}} cure and knoop hardness of a microfine-hybrid composite resin that was photo-activated using different methods. A bipartite brass mold was filled with composite resin and photo-activation was performed using four methods: (1) Intermittent method using quartz tungsten halogen (QTH) light curing unit (LCU) (2) <b>Continuous</b> <b>method</b> (QTH) (3) Exponential method (QTH) (4) <b>Continuous</b> <b>method</b> using light-emitting diode (LED). Depth of cure was measured at the unexposed bottom surface of the specimen using microtester as a penetrometer. The surfaces exposed to light were subjected to knoop hardness testing, using a digital microhardness tester. Knoop hardness measurements were obtained at the top surface and at depths of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mm. The data was analyzed using anova and Tukey's test (5 %). Results showed that the depth of cure was higher with the intermittent method (QTH), followed by the <b>continuous</b> <b>method</b> (QTH), the exponential method and the <b>continuous</b> <b>method</b> (LED). At the top surface and up to 1 mm, <b>continuous</b> <b>method</b> (LED) demonstrated the highest knoop hardness number (KHN).
