The remainder of the bridge foundations consisted of cast iron piers fitted with cutting shoes sunk by excavation by hand labour working in airlocks, and by weighting. Piers for the swing span consisted of eight cast iron cylinders tapering from 6 to 4.5 ft diameter from base to top which surrounded a ninth cylinder of 7 ft base diameter; the [...] wall width cylinders were sunk {{to the level of}} sandstone bedrock at a depth of around 78 ft; after which they were filled with concrete. The central river pier had similar foundations of two 8 ft cast iron piers braced together. The swing span turntable consisted of 29 ft diameter steel conical roller paths and bearings, supported on a circular 20 in deep box girder in eight sections, with a twelve section box girder above, supporting the superstructure. The bridge turned about a central heavy cast pivot, with ties to the upper and lower box girders, and to the bearings. The bridge superstructure was constructed of wrought iron plate girders, with an asymmetric 'hogback' shape; the swing span extremities were 45 and 85 ft from the centre line, with a 92.45 LT counterweight; the maximum web depth was 14.5 ft. The fixed span was of similar, but symmetrical construction. The bridge was turned by the reaction of a rotating vertical shaft on a rack on the lower roller path. Power was supplied hydraulically from an accumulator (charged by steam engine power) near the railway station, via underground concentric pressure and return pipes in the central swing span pier - driving a pair of three <b>cylinder</b> <b>hydraulic</b> engines located in the cabin.
