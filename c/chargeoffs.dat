50|$|On August 20, 2009 Advanta {{announced}} that its <b>chargeoffs</b> {{had returned to}} 24.02% following June's peak, June having been so high because of the change from charging off at 180 days of delinquency to charging off at 120 days, however the percentage of cards 30 days late had risen to 9.98% from 8.28%, portending a rise in future <b>chargeoffs.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{percentage}} {{of credit card}} loans that are charged off by card issuers during a particular month or quarter is an important metric. It provides insights into the financial health of the credit card industry and the U. S. consumer. After offering {{a brief overview of}} credit card <b>chargeoff</b> reporting, this paper describes five different <b>chargeoff</b> statistics in detail. Sampling techniques, frequency, availability, and calculation methods for each statistic are discussed and compared. One of the paper’s key findings is that the various on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet <b>chargeoff</b> measures, after moving in the same general direction for almost a decade, have recently diverged and become less correlated.

50|$|A charge-off or <b>chargeoff</b> is the {{declaration}} by a creditor (usually {{a credit card}} account) that an amount of debt {{is unlikely to be}} collected. This occurs when a consumer becomes severely delinquent on a debt. Traditionally, creditors will make this declaration at the point of six months without payment. A charge-off is a form of write-off.|$|R

50|$|Under the judgments, deficiencies, and <b>chargeoffs</b> Program (JDC), the RTC {{established}} limited {{partnerships and}} selected private sector entities {{to be the}} general partner of each JDC Partnership. The JDC program {{was different from the}} MIF, N/S Series and Land Fund programs in that the general partner paid only a nominal price for the assets and was selected on a beauty-contest basis, and the general partner (rather than the partnership itself) had to absorb most operating costs.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we examine the {{performance}} of banks headquartered in Hollywood and banks headquartered in Silicon Valley in the period - first quarter 2008 until second quarter 2012, which includes {{the period of the}} Great Recession - December 2007 to June 2009. We find that during the financial crisis both Silicon Valley and Hollywood banks suffered but Silicon Valley banks much less than Hollywood banks. After the recession, banks in both regions improved performance again Silicon Valley banks recovering faster. We also find that the level of deposits, the leverage ratio and total loan <b>chargeoffs</b> consistently {{play a role in the}} performance of banks...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} banks’ loan loss allowances for samples of US banks and three non-US samples: a group of 21 countries, Canada and Japan. The model includes fundamental (or non-discretionary) determinants of the allowance such as non-performing loans, and discretionary determinants such as income before the loan loss provision. The {{results suggest that the}} loan loss allowance is sensitive to pre-provision income in almost all samples. However, the results also suggest that some variables thought to reflect fundamental factors in US analysis, such as net <b>chargeoffs,</b> are not significant factors for non-US banks. loan loss allowance, accounting standards, international banking, nonperforming loan, discretionary accruals...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} findings of and highlights {{issues associated with}} an extensive internal loss severity study for the JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) wholesale bank. The recently completed loss given default (LGD) study draws upon 18 years of loan loss history at JPMC for 3, 761 defaulted borrowers at its several heritage organizations. Estimates of LGD are key parameters in a bank’s risk-rating system that impact facility ratings, approval levels, and the setting of loss reserves, as well as developing credit capital underlying risk and profitability calculations. LGD can be measured as either the net charge-off rate (accounting LGD), or {{the present value of}} cash losses (economic LGD), with respect to the initial book value of a defaulted obligation. Analysis of JPMC’s loss history entailed compilation of quarter-end book balances, charge-offs, recoveries of <b>chargeoffs,</b> and cash flows for all customers that defaulted in the period 1982 - 99, with losses determined through 2002. LGD was computed for JPMC as a whol...|$|E
