5|$|Charles V {{ascended the}} thrones of both Spain and the Holy Roman Empire {{following}} {{the deaths of}} his grandfathers, Ferdinand in 1516 and Maximilian in 1519. Francis I likewise became king of France upon the death of Louis in 1515, leaving three relatively young rulers and {{an opportunity for a}} <b>clean</b> <b>slate.</b> The careful diplomacy of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey had resulted in the Treaty of London in 1518, aimed at uniting the kingdoms of western Europe {{in the wake of a}} new Ottoman threat, and it seemed that peace might be secured. Henry met Francis I on 7 June 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold near Calais for a fortnight of lavish entertainment. Both hoped for friendly relations in place of the wars of the previous decade. The strong air of competition laid to rest any hopes of a renewal of the Treaty of London, however, and conflict was inevitable. Henry had more in common with Charles, whom he met once before and once after Francis. Charles brought the Empire into war with France in 1521; Henry offered to mediate, but little was achieved and by the end of the year Henry had aligned England with Charles. He still clung to his previous aim of restoring English lands in France, but also sought to secure an alliance with Burgundy, then part of Charles' realm, and the continued support of Charles. A small English attack in the north of France made up little ground. Charles defeated and captured Francis at Pavia and could dictate peace; but he believed he owed Henry nothing. Sensing this, Henry decided to take England out of the war before his ally, signing the Treaty of the More on 30 August 1525.|$|E

Now, players were suspended for one game after accumulating two yellow cards in the group stage, or two yellow cards in the knockout stage.

25|$|By 1870, the Democraticâ€“Conservative {{leadership}} {{across the}} South decided {{it had to}} end its opposition to Reconstruction and black suffrage to survive {{and move on to}} new issues. The Grant administration had proven by its crackdown on the Ku Klux Klan that it would use as much federal power as necessary to suppress open anti-black violence. Democrats in the North concurred with these Southern Democrats. They wanted to fight the Republican Party on economic grounds rather than race. The New Departure offered the chance for a <b>clean</b> <b>slate</b> without having to re-fight the Civil War every election.

Hello Games reset the servers for the game just prior to 9 August 2016 so as to give all players a <b>clean</b> <b>slate.</b> Prior to official release, Sony requested sites to take down videos from early copies, citing that {{due to the nature}} of the game, they considered that Hello Games' vision of the game would only be met once a day-one patch was made available at release.

25|$|Parts of {{the story}} also take place in London, the capital of Britain. In this timeline, the British people are impoverished due to the German occupation; William Shakespeare and his works are more widely known and {{published}} in Germany than in Shakespeare's homeland, partly due to Britain's economic collapse. During the Second World War, much of London was destroyed by dive bombers and panzers as well as during the last-ditch resistance by Churchill and his supporters. Key British buildings including the Parliament building, Big Ben and St Paul's Cathedral have been completely destroyed, with their only remaining legacy being photographs. Some {{areas of the city}} have been in ruins for over seventy years, due to harsh reparations imposed on the British by the Germans and partisan uprisings that would only be completely crushed by 1970.

Blake turns the tables on Ben and Alexis and recovers his wealth, but loses his memory after an oil rig explosion.

Adam's season-long romance with Blake's secretary Dana Waring (Leann Hunley) culminates in a wedding, which is punctuated in the May 6, 1987 season finale by Alexis's car plunging off a bridge into a river and the violent return of a vengeful Matthew Blaisdel. Although the first episode of season seven premiered with a high Nielsen rating of a 20.1, the competition with Magnum, P.I., now in the same time slot, and the constant storyline changes led to Dynasty falling out of the top 20 to #25.|$|E

The two had a heated, contentious meeting in which McCain said he had not spent years in North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camps to have his courage or integrity questioned; the friendship ended and they would not speak again.

Meanwhile, Keating filed a lawsuit against the FHLBB, saying it had leaked confidential information about Lincoln. The outgoing head of the FHLBB in Washington deferred judgment and the new head was more sympathetic to Keating.

There then follows a small break where he meets the spirit of a dead friend in Dublin, offering some closure to his recent problems.
