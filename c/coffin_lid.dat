5|$|In 2007, a {{single-storey}} {{building from}} the 1950s was demolished on Grey Friars Street giving archaeologists {{the opportunity to}} excavate and search for traces of the medieval friary. Very little was unearthed, except for a fragment of a post-medieval stone <b>coffin</b> <b>lid.</b> The results of the dig suggested that {{the remains of the}} friary church were farther west than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hartnell's grave, {{the grave}} of Private William Braine was largely intact. When he was exhumed, the survey team saw signs that his burial had been hasty. His arms, body, and head had not been {{positioned}} carefully in the coffin, {{and one of his}} undershirts had been put on backwards. The coffin seemed too small for him; its lid had pressed down on his nose. A large copper plaque with his name and other personal data punched into it adorned his <b>coffin</b> <b>lid.</b>|$|E

50|$|Unlike the {{analogous}} first-sale {{doctrine in}} copyright, the patent exhaustion doctrine {{has not been}} codified into the patent statute, and is thus still a common law doctrine. It was first explicitly recognized by the Supreme Court in 1873 in Adams v. Burke. In that case, the patentee Adams assigned to another the right to make, use, and sell patented <b>coffin</b> <b>lids</b> only within a ten-mile radius of Boston. Burke (an undertaker), a customer of the assignee, bought the <b>coffin</b> <b>lids</b> from the manufacturer-assignee within the ten-mile radius, but later used (and effectively resold) the patented <b>coffin</b> <b>lids</b> outside of the ten-mile radius, in his trade {{in the course of}} burying a person. The patentee Adams sued the undertaker Burke for patent infringement, but the Supreme Court found no infringement liability: Once the <b>coffin</b> <b>lids</b> were lawfully made and sold, “there is no restriction on their use to be implied {{for the benefit of the}} patentee or his assignees or licensees.” Because the sale was authorized (bought from an authorized seller within the ten-mile radius), the defendant acquired the right to use the <b>coffin</b> <b>lids</b> free from any claim of the patentee, even though he carried it outside the ten-mile radius to use it.|$|R
5|$|Hannah Beswick {{was born}} in 1688, the {{daughter}} of John and Patience Beswick, of Cheetwood Old Hall, Manchester, she inherited considerable wealth from her father who died in 1706. Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his <b>coffin</b> <b>lid</b> had been about to be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, Dr Charles White, confirmed {{that he was still}} alive. John regained consciousness a few days later, and lived for many more years.|$|E
5|$|In 1538 the Abbey {{with all}} land and {{possessions}} was surrendered by the monks to Henry VIII {{in the course}} of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The main buildings of the abbey were then demolished, although some of the decorative floor tiles were relaid in the neighbouring Church of St Peter and St Paul. The whole property and advowson was then granted to Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, later 1st Duke of Somerset. On his execution in 1552 it reverted to The Crown. Stone from the abbey was used in many of the local buildings. In 1872 when collecting stone labourers found a blue stone <b>coffin</b> <b>lid</b> under which the pavement of the 14th century lady chapel was uncovered. In 1924 a pageant was held at the site, involving around 500 people, representing the history of the abbey from its foundation to the dissolution.|$|E
5|$|The monuments {{within the}} cathedral include {{recumbent}} figures and memorials of several abbots and bishops: Abbot Walter Newbery {{who died in}} 1473 and Abbot William Hunt (died 1481) are within 14th-century recesses {{on the north side}} of the Lady Chapel, while the recumbent effigy of Abbot John Newland (died 1515) is in a similar recess on the southern side. The <b>coffin</b> <b>lid</b> of Abbot David (died 1234) is in the north transept. In the north choir aisle is a chest tomb to Bishop Bush (died 1558) which includes six fluted Ionic columns with an entablature canopy.

25|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{seven years after}} Queen Victoria's Jublilee, a major {{reconstruction}} took place. A new bellcote was built, retaining the old finials. A new north window was added, matching the south windows. The west window was restored where the doorway had been, and the south door which had been bricked up was re-opened. The old oak box pews were removed and there panels placed against the walls. The east window was redesigned and revealed a <b>coffin</b> <b>lid</b> dated c.1300 used as a memorial to a one time Rural Dean, with shears to cut the tonsure of the priesthood.|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1846, Harry Longueville Jones {{said that}} St Mary's was [...] "one of the {{smallest}} buildings of its class in the island" [...] and had [...] "no feature of any architectural value." [...] He noted the [...] "elaborate" [...] <b>coffin</b> <b>lid,</b> {{and said that the}} font (a [...] "rude production of the twelfth century") was [...] "one of the most remarkable in the collection of Anglesey monuments". [...] The historian and clergyman Edmund Tyrrell Green, writing a survey of Anglesey church architecture and contents in 1929, referred to the <b>coffin</b> <b>lid</b> as one of the county's [...] "outstanding examples" [...] of sepulchral memorials.|$|E
500|$|St Mary's Church, Llanfair-yn-y-Cwmwd {{is a small}} medieval parish church {{near the}} village of Dwyran, in Anglesey, north Wales. The {{building}} probably dates from the 15th century, with some alterations. [...] It contains a 12th-century carved stone font and a 13th-century decorated <b>coffin</b> <b>lid.</b> The bell is inscribed with the year of its casting, 1582. The historian Henry Rowlands was vicar of St Mary's in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. [...] Maurice Wilks, who invented the Land Rover, is buried in the churchyard.|$|E

50|$|The {{village has}} {{been home to}} a place of worship for well over a {{thousand}} years. The Saxon's chose the site for a minster in the 9th century, though it was sacked by the invading Danes in the 870s and rebuilt soon after. Only a pair of Saxon <b>coffin</b> <b>lids</b> remain from the original church.|$|R
500|$|The roughly oval gritsone font at {{the west}} end of the nave, which is from the 12th century, has a zig-zag pattern, and three sides {{decorated}} with a cross. The base of the font, which is rectangular with rounded corners, has misshapen carved human heads at the corners {{and in the middle of}} one side, and a snake on two of the sides. A [...] "P"-shaped sign on the east side of the font may have been added later. [...] St Mary's has a <b>coffin</b> <b>lid</b> dating from the middle of the 13th century, displayed upside down on the north wall of the chancel. It is decorated with a carved cross and a foliage design. One 19th-century visitor noted another three old plain coffin lids on the church floor, with another in the churchyard near the east window. As well as an 18th-century slate plaque on the south wall of the nave, there are also various memorials from the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
500|$|According to Uncut, The Marble Index is [...] "one of {{that rare}} breed of {{recordings}} which, {{the better part}} of four decades later, still has no adequate comparison, existing in a genre all its own". The album is considered a -goth record. André Escarameia felt the album [...] "anticipated gothic rock by more than a decade due to [...] ethereally darker [...] and disturbing sonority." [...] Its soundscape has been described as [...] "bleak", [...] "chilly", [...] "harrowing", and [...] "everything from the sound of someone rapping on a <b>coffin</b> <b>lid</b> to that of being buried alive". In her 1969 Rolling Stone review, Anne Marie Micklo described it as [...] "mood music, with an obscure and elusive text recited over it". Regarding the record's sonority, British author Simon Goddard wrote, [...] "it was on [...] that the real sound of Nico was unleashed: a bleak pumping misery which would define her music for the last two decades of her life." [...] Lenny Kaye of Wondering Sound described the album as [...] "Circe-like".|$|E
500|$|Parsons and Moore {{devised a}} method of communication; one knock for yes, two knocks for no. [...] Using this system, the ghost {{appeared}} to claim that Fanny had been murdered. [...] It was conjectured that the mysterious figure in white which so terrified James Franzen, presumed to be the ghost of Elizabeth, had appeared there to warn her sister of her impending death. [...] As the first ghost had seemingly vanished, this charge against Kent—that he murdered Elizabeth—was never acted on, but through repeated questioning of Fanny's ghost it was divined that she had died not {{from the effects of}} smallpox, but rather from arsenic poisoning. [...] The deadly toxin had apparently been administered by Kent about two hours before Fanny died and now, it was supposed, her spirit wanted justice. [...] Moore had heard from Parsons how Kent had pursued the debt he was owed, and he had also heard from Ann Lynes, who had complained that as Fanny's <b>coffin</b> <b>lid</b> was screwed down she {{had not been able to}} see her sister's corpse. [...] Moore thought that Fanny's body might not show any visible signs of smallpox and that if she had been poisoned, the lack of scarring would have been something Kent would rather keep hidden. [...] As a clergyman with inclinations toward Methodism he was inclined to trust the ghost, but for added support he enlisted the aid of Thomas Broughton, an early Methodist. [...] Broughton visited Cock Lane on 5January and left convinced the ghost was real. [...] The story spread through London, The Public Ledger began to publish detailed accounts of the phenomenon, and Kent fell under public suspicion as a murderer.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the church}} are several monuments, {{the best of}} which are {{to the memory of}} the Hussey family, as are the 1874 tiles and the reredos.

50|$|In {{the churchyard}} {{east of the}} chancel {{is a pair of}} stone medieval <b>coffin</b> <b>lids</b> that may be a remnant from the {{previous}} church. Other remnants are a memorial tablet and effigy inside the present church. The tablet is in memory of the lawyer Edmund Meese, who died in 1617. The effigy is of a late 16th- or early 17th-century lawyer, and may also represent Edmund Meese.|$|R
5000|$|Decans first {{appeared}} in the 10th Dynasty (2100 BCE) on <b>coffin</b> <b>lids.</b> [...] The sequence of these star patterns began with Sothis/Sirius, and each decan contained a set of stars and corresponding divinities. As measures of time, the rising and setting of decans marked 'hours' and groups of 10 days which comprised an Egyptian year. The ancient Book of Nut, covers the subject of the decans.|$|R
2500|$|There are two tomb {{recesses}} in {{the south}} wall, one finely-moulded, probably of c.1300. [...] In one is a large, stone <b>coffin</b> <b>lid</b> with carved inscription in medieval French which commemorates Henry de Elyngton, Rector of St Paul's between 1384 and 1400, (although this stone has suffered from some physical deterioration in recent years), {{and in the other}} a miniature, thirteenth-century <b>coffin</b> <b>lid,</b> presumably that of a child.

2500|$|Desmond gathers many of {{the islanders}} at the benefit concert of Daniel Widmore (Jeremy Davies) and DriveShaft. One by one, each protagonist begins to {{recognize}} one another based on close contact with a person or object that was important to them throughout their time on the island, receiving flashes of memory. Eventually, most of them remember their past lives and {{are drawn to the}} church that was to be the site of Jack's father's funeral. John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) regains the use of his legs after being successfully operated on by Jack. After remembering his time on the island through the flashes of memory, Locke attempts to convince Jack of the truth, but Jack, although also experiencing flashes of memory, resists the revelation. Locke later [...] meets Ben outside the church where Locke forgives him for murdering him. Ben then meets Hurley, who says everyone is inside, motioning him to join them, but Ben elects to stay outside. As Hurley heads back inside, he says to Ben that he was a [...] "real good number two...", to which Ben replies back that Hurley was a [...] "great number one". Kate later encounters Jack, and while her presence causes him to experience more flashes, he continues to resist. She takes him to the church and instructs him to enter though the back door, telling him the others will be waiting for him. In the church, he enters a room where there are symbols not just of Christianity, but also of other faiths such as Hinduism, Judaism, Islam etc. He then encounters his father's coffin. He opens the <b>coffin</b> <b>lid</b> and discovers it to be empty. Christian Shephard (John Terry) then appears behind him. Jack slowly comes to realize that he is dead as well. After an emotional embrace, Christian reassures him that the events leading up to now actually happened and the time he spent with the people on the island was [...] "the most important period" [...] of his life. He explains to Jack that time has no meaning in this place and that they [...] "made" [...] the place to [...] "find each other", independent of the time at which they died. Christian explains that place exists so the Oceanic 815 survivors could [...] "let go" [...] and [...] "move on" [...] together. Jack and Christian go out into the church to meet the others. Everyone is able to see, recognize, and remember everyone else and their lives together. After an emotional reunion, Christian opens the front doors, revealing another bright light that slowly envelops everyone inside the church.|$|E
50|$|Beginning {{with the}} 9th Dynasty, ancient Egyptians {{produced}} 'Diagonal star tables', which were usually {{painted on the}} inside surface of wooden <b>coffin</b> <b>lids.</b> This practice continued until the 12th dynasty. These 'Diagonal star tables' or star charts are also known as 'diagonal star clocks'; in the past they have also been known as 'star calendars', or 'decanal clocks'. These star charts featuring the paintings of Egyptian deities, decans, constellations, and star observations are also found on the ceilings of tombs and temples.|$|R

50|$|The north {{aisle and}} north {{transept}} {{are thought to}} have been added later than the 13th century as burials and parts of <b>coffin</b> <b>lids</b> were found under the foundations. The church is known to have been enlarged in the 14th century and many of the internal arches are Decorated period. By the early 18th century the church had fallen into decay but the development of Holkham Estate led to renewed interest in the church. In 1767 the Countess Dowager of Leicester put up £1,000 for its repair. She had overseen the completion of Holkham Hall after the death of the 1st Earl of Leicester in 1759.|$|R
