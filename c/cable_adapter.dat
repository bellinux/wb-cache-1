50|$|A vector network {{analyzer}} achieves highly accurate measurements by correcting for the systematic errors in the instrument, the characteristics of <b>cables,</b> <b>adapters</b> and test fixtures. The process of error correction, although commonly just called calibration, is an entirely different process, and may be performed by an engineer several times in an hour. Sometimes it is called user-calibration, to indicate the difference from periodic calibration by a manufacturer.|$|R
5000|$|NTL {{provided}} ex-Cable and Wireless subscribers with broadband {{through the}} set-top box (STB) {{also used for}} digital television services, adopting the rationale that subscribers could self-install. Initially, NTL supplied a [...] "Self Install Kit" [...] consisting of connecting <b>cable,</b> <b>adapters</b> and an install CD. Following demonstrated problems, NTL gradually introduced cable modems and phased out the self-install approach. The Pace STBs proved highly problematic, exhibiting two major flaws.|$|R

50|$|When {{attached}} to a PC, an OTG device requires a cable which has a USB Standard-A plug on one end and a micro-B plug on the other end. In order to attach a peripheral to an OTG device, the peripheral either needs a cable ending in a micro-A plug, which is inserted into the OTG device's micro-AB receptacle, or the OTG device itself needs an <b>adapter</b> <b>cable</b> with a micro-A plug on one end and a Standard-A receptacle on the other. The <b>adapter</b> <b>cable</b> enables any standard USB peripheral to be {{attached to}} an OTG device. Attaching two OTG devices together requires either a cable with a micro-B plug {{at one end and}} a micro-A plug at the other, or can be achieved using a combination of the PC <b>cable</b> and <b>adapter</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Super Game Boy 2 also {{shares the}} same smaller style link cable port and {{therefore}} {{uses the same}} <b>cables</b> and <b>adapters.</b>|$|R

50|$|Pictures may be {{transferred}} from a digital camera's xD card {{to a personal}} computer by plugging the camera into the PC via a USB or IEEE 1394 cable, or by removing the card from the camera and inserting it into a card reader. In both cases, the computer sees the card as a mass storage device containing image files, although software or firmware can alter this representation. Card readers may {{be integrated into the}} PC or attached via <b>cable.</b> <b>Adapters</b> are available to allow an xD picture card to be plugged into other readers (and in some cases cameras), including PC card, parallel port, CompactFlash and SmartMedia.|$|R
50|$|In July 2008, Drobo {{announced}} a 2nd generation model, which offered a faster core processor, optimized firmware, better USB 2.0 performance {{and a pair}} of FireWire 800 ports, which are compatible with FireWire 400-to-800 <b>cables</b> and <b>adapters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Stereo audio {{applications}} {{use either}} black and red, grey and red or {{white and red}} RCA connectors; in all three cases, red denotes right. White or purple may also be replaced by black. Some older tape recorders, and equipment like receivers designed to connect to them, use a 5-pin DIN connector to connect left and right for record and playback with a single <b>cable.</b> <b>Adapters</b> between this connector and RCA connectors have used white and red for left and right channel recording, and blue (or sometimes black) and yellow for playback, {{but this is not}} universal. Most modern equipment with RCA connectors for recording devices simply uses white and red for all stereo pairs, whether record or playback.|$|R
50|$|A {{battery life}} {{of up to}} 300 shots or 150 minutes is {{achieved}} from a rechargeable Lithium-ion battery which is recharged via the USB port. A <b>cable</b> and <b>adapter</b> are supplied allowing charging from a suitable laptop, PC or from the main supply.|$|R

25|$|Apple's first mice used a DE-9 {{connection}} carrying quadrature signals. As {{the personal}} computer was {{still in its infancy}} with no standards, Apple's mice could be used on any system capable of using such a quadrature mouse, in combination with a spliced <b>cable</b> or <b>adapter</b> as necessary.|$|R
5000|$|At retail, the S4 {{is bundled}} with a USB <b>cable,</b> AC <b>adapter,</b> and in-ear headphones. The [...] "S-View Cover" [...] {{accessory}} [...] "closes" [...] the phone.

50|$|Each Simon {{was shipped}} with a {{charging}} base station, two nickel-cadmium batteries and a protective leather cover. Optional was a PCMCIA pager card designed by Motorola, an RS232 <b>adapter</b> <b>cable</b> {{for use with}} PC-Link to access files from a personal computer, and an RJ11 <b>adapter</b> <b>cable</b> to allow voice and data calls to be made over POTS land-lines. The RJ11 adapter helped users reduce expensive cellular phone bills or make calls where cellular coverage didn't exist in 1994.|$|R
50|$|DMS-59 (Dual Monitor Solution, 59 pins) is {{generally}} used for computer video cards. It provides two Digital Visual Interface (DVI) or Video Graphics Array (VGA) outputs {{in a single}} connector. An <b>adapter</b> <b>cable</b> is needed for conversion from DMS-59 (digital) to DVI (digital) or VGA (analog), and different types of <b>adapter</b> <b>cables</b> exist. The connector is four pins high and 15 pins wide, with a single pin missing from the bottom row, in a D-shaped shell, with thumbscrews.|$|R

50|$|There is one onboard Ethernet interface, {{which can}} be {{accessed}} from a built-in 10BASE-T jack or via a special 26-pin port that provides both AUI and audio connections; {{only one of these}} network ports can be active at a time. A special <b>cable</b> or <b>adapter</b> is needed to convert the latter port to a standard DA-15 connector.|$|R

5000|$|The DMS-59 {{connector}} {{is used by}} AMD (AMD FireMV), Nvidia and Matrox {{for video}} cards sold in Lenovo Thinkcentres, Viglen Genies and Omninos, Dell, and HP computers. DMS-59 connectors also appeared on Sun Computers. Some confusion has been caused {{by the fact that}} vendors label cards with DMS-59 as [...] "supports DVI", but the cards have no DVI connectors built-in. Such cards, when equipped with only a VGA connector <b>adapter</b> <b>cable,</b> cannot be connected to a monitor with only a DVI-D input. A DMS-59 to DVI <b>adapter</b> <b>cable</b> needs to be used with such monitors.|$|R
50|$|The 13W3 {{connector}} can {{be converted}} into a standard VGA connector using <b>cables</b> and <b>adapters</b> that are commonly available. This allows modern multisync monitors, which are common on today's computers, {{to be used with}} these workstations {{as long as they are}} sync-on-green compatible. Likewise, as many newer Sun monitors support multisync, similar cables can be used to connect them to modern computers.|$|R
5000|$|Connecting {{an older}} device {{to a host}} with a USB-C {{receptacle}} requires a <b>cable</b> or <b>adapter</b> with a USB-A or USB-B plug or receptacle on one end and a USB-C plug on the other end. Legacy adapters with a USB-C receptacle are [...] "not defined or allowed" [...] by the specification because they can create [...] "many invalid and potentially unsafe" [...] cable combinations.|$|R
50|$|Included in {{the retail}} box are an SD card, desk stand, handle for putting the H2 in a {{microphone}} stand, wind screen, 3.5mm TRS to RCA cable, earbud headphones, USB <b>cable</b> and power <b>adapter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After {{several weeks}} of {{customer}} complaints on OnePlus forums and on Reddit, Google engineer Benson Leung showed that the USB Type-C cable and USB Type-C-to-Micro-USB adapter offered by OnePlus {{do not conform to}} the USB specification.
