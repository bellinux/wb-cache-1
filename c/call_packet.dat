Because optical wavelength routing is transparent to IP, one can achieve very high throughput and low delay when packets are made to bypass the IP forwarding process by being switched directly through the optical crossconnect. We study the performance of a specific instantiation of this approach,which we <b>call</b> <b>packet</b> over wavelengths (POW).

40|$|With {{widespread}} use of the Internet, there {{is an increase in}} concern over users' privacy. In particular, an adversary may identify the receiver involved in a communication session by observing the packet traffic. We propose a new routing mechanism, which we <b>call</b> <b>packet</b> cloaking, to protect the privacy of a receiver. The main idea of packet cloaking is to transmit multiple copies of a sent packet to a selected group of k receivers, so that an adversary may only identify the true receiver with a probability of 1 /k. We present the system design to support packet cloaking. We also propose two metrics that measure the receiver privacy, based on evaluating the similarity between the sender/receiver traffic patterns.

We are interested in determining maximum end-to-end delays and backlogs of messages or packets going from a source node to a destination node, through a given virtual path in the network. Our objective here is to give a network calculus approach for calculating the performance bounds. First we propose a new concept of curves that we <b>call</b> <b>packet</b> curves. The curves permit to model constraints on packet lengths of a given data flow, when the lengths are allowed to be different. Second, we use this new concept to propose an approach for calculating residual services for data flows served under non preemptive service disciplines. Third, we model a binary switch (with two input ports and two output ports), where data is served under wormhole discipline. We present our approach for computing the residual services and deduce the worst case bounds for flows passing through a wormhole binary switch. Finally, we illustrate this approach in numerical examples, and show how to extend it to feedforward networks. Comment: 26 page...|$|E

40|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) {{has been}} used {{increasingly}} to carry phone conversations. End-to-end VoIP is growing, but even more, service providers have been moving voice traffic to IP in their core networks; a voice call starts out on the traditional phone network, moves to IP in the core, and then moves back to the traditional network. Quality of Service (QoS) is {{a major issue in}} VoIP implementations, but is poorly understood. We are studying QoS using data collected from a real network, namely the Global Crossing Network (GBLX). Critical to the study of QoS is gaining a comprehensive understanding of the statistical properties of the important traffic components: call arrival process, call duration distribution, silence suppression, and packet arrival process. Every component involves different mathematical structures and requires a different style of statistical analysis. New visualization tools are developed to portray the dynamic details of every individual call, which are instrumental in validating the accuracy and consistency of the data and studying the <b>call</b> <b>packet</b> process. To estimate the power spectrum of the packet count process with changing mean and variance, a new statistical technique is developed to correct locally for the non-stationarity. Furthermore, to study QoS for scenarios that did not occur in our collected data, a queueing simulation is performed by varying the linkspeed and utilization rate. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} maximizing the {{utilization}} of optical network bandwidth by proposing a technique <b>called</b> <b>packet</b> containerization {{at the edge of the}} optical network. This technique aggregates several packets into a single larger <b>packet</b> <b>called</b> the container <b>packet.</b> The container packet is then sent over the optical backbone network. The purpose of packet aggregation is to ensure that container packets have sufficient data to increase the bandwidth utilization of the optical links. To address quality-of-service requirements for delay sensitive applications, we reduce the packet delay inherent in the aggregation process by introducing an aggregation timeout threshold to guarantee an upper bound on the aggregation delay. Using simulation models supported by a mean-value mathematical analysis we show that the Containerization with Aggregation Timeout (CAT) algorithm significantly increases the utilization of the optical network bandwidth subject to time-out constraints. ...|$|R

40|$|So far, we {{have only}} looked at {{networks}} without dealing {{with the issue of}} how to send information in them from one node to another. The problem of sending information in a network is known as routing. Routing involves two basic activities: • The determination of routing paths, and • the transport of information groups (typically <b>called</b> <b>packets)</b> along the paths. The first item is usually referred to as path selection, and the second item is usually <b>called</b> <b>packet</b> switching. In this section we only concentrate on the problem of selecting good paths. Strategies for sending packets along the paths will be discussed in the next section. Certainly, if there is only one source-destination pair in the network that wants to exchange information (and all the edges in the network have the same capacity), then the best solution would be to connect them via a shortest path. But what about multiple source-destination pairs? Choosing a shortest path for each of them may lead to a high congestion and therefore a poor routing performance. For example, consider a complete binary tree in which the leaves are connected so that they form an n × n-mesh. Then for most pairs of nodes the shortest path would lead via the root of the binary tree, but if many nodes want to exchange information, it is much better to use the mesh-edges instea...|$|R

The amount of data transferred in a single cycle is called a physical unit or phit. As is observable, {{the width of a}} network is also equal to the phit size. Hence the bandwidth of the network can also be defined in terms of phit/sec.

50|$|Switching Strategy : The routing {{algorithm}} only {{determines the}} path that a message must take to reach its destination node. The actual traversal of the message within the network {{is the responsibility of}} the switching strategy. There are basically two types of switching strategies, a circuit switched network is a network where a path is reserved and blocked off from other messages, till the message is delivered to its destination node. A famous example of circuit switched network is the telephone services, which establish a circuit through many switches for a call. The alternative approach is the packet switched network where messages are broken down into smaller compact entities <b>called</b> <b>packets.</b> Each packet contains a part of data in addition to a sequence number. This implies that each packet can now be transferred individually and assembled at the destination based on the sequence number.|$|R
30|$|We {{consider}} a wireless communication system with K users {{and a single}} central base station. Each user is subject to both time-varying frequency-selective fading and position-dependent path loss. This setting was addressed before in, e.g., [1], where proportional fair scheduling was compared to hard fair scheduling. While proportional fair scheduler [2] does not guarantee any upper bound on the delay of a data packet, hard fair scheduling enforces that each data packet is scheduled instantaneously. Packet delay can further be classified into average tolerable delay and maximum tolerable delay. This work focuses on the later definition of delay which is also <b>called</b> <b>packet</b> deadline.|$|R
