40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} five Productive Development Policies (PDPs) {{implemented in}} Costa Rica, finding {{that they are}} not optimally addressing market failures. Moreover, government failures rather than market failures represent the main justification for PDPs. Even in the presence of market failures, the policy instruments applied are not necessarily the most economically efficient but rather the most politically feasible options. In addition, the lack of policy evaluation and monitoring prevents adjustments and <b>corrections</b> <b>of</b> such policies. <b>Addressing</b> the arguments for policy intervention and incorporating the results of evaluation into policy design and reform are necessary conditions for success. In spite of positive policy outcomes, limitations to enhance competitiveness and create the conditions for productivity growth are still present. An umbrella approach in the case of those PDPs that reinforce each other is necessary for productivity growth. Policy Analysis, Policy Making, Industrial Policy, Costa Rica...|$|R

40|$|Malocclusion {{superimposed}} {{with severe}} periodontitis may present {{a great challenge}} to clinicians while providing orthodontic treatment due the episodic and site-specific nature of the disease with risk of rapid tissue breakdown. However, orthodontic treatment in such situation may contribute significantly to the overall rehabilitation both functionally and esthetically. In this article, a case report outlines a combined periodontic-orthodontic management of compromised dentition. A 37 -year-old female patient with significant medical history was treated for Class II Division 1 type of malocclusion associated with spaced upper and lower anterior teeth, deep overbite, and increased overjet, superimposed with chronic generalized periodontitis and bone loss. Treatment was completed using temporary anchorage devices assisted strategically applied force and modified tandem retraction biomechanics amidst management of acute inflammatory episodes during and mucogingival complication after treatment. Affected areas healed very well after post-orthodontic periodontal treatment with minimal pocket depth, and bleeding on probing, and a healthy zone of attached gingiva at the follow up visits. The orthodontic results lead to improvement in patient's facial profile, lip posture, and <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> protrusion which <b>addressed</b> her main concern. One year follow-up shows good orthodontic and periodontic stability. The report {{highlights the importance of}} identifying “at risk” individuals and continuous monitoring of disease status during treatment.
