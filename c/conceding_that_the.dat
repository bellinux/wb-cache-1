5|$|Rishabhanatha {{is said to}} be {{the founder}} of Jainism by the {{different}} Jain sub-traditions. Jain chronology places Rishabhanatha in ahistorical terms, as someone who lived millions of years ago. He is stated to have lived for 8,400,000 purva years. His height is described in the Jain texts to be 500 arc lengths (800 ells), or about 1,200 feet. Such descriptions of non-human heights and age are also found for the next 21 Tirthankaras in Jain texts, and according to Kristi Wiley – a scholar at University of California Berkeley known for her publications in Jainism, most Indologists and scholars consider all the first 22 of 24 Tirthankaras to be prehistorical, or ahistorical and a part of Jain mythology. However, among Jain writers and some Indian scholars, some of the first 22 Tirthankaras are considered to reflect historical figures, with a few <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> inflated biographical statistics as mythical.|$|E
5|$|There was however one British {{squadron}} {{that had}} maintained {{contact with the}} French: since the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805, the Admiralty had stationed a squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth off Cadiz to watch {{the remnants of the}} combined fleet. In November 1805, reports reached Duckworth of a French squadron operating against British convoys off the Savage Islands between Madeira and the Canary Islands. This squadron, which belonged to Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand, had left France in July 1805. Immediately sailing to investigate, Duckworth abandoned Cadiz, leaving just two frigates to watch the Allied fleet at anchor. Passing the Savage and Canary Islands, Duckworth continued to the Cape Verde Islands before <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French had escaped him and turning northwards again. Allemand was already far to the north. He eventually returned to France without incident on 23 December.|$|E

500|$|Early {{practice}} speeds approached [...] NASCAR had mandated {{before the}} qualifier that {{the holes in}} the cars' restrictor plates be reduced by , later <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rule may have affected some teams more than others. According to Gilliland, [...] "They threw a curveball at us this morning with the restrictor plate and (engine builder) Doug Yates wasn't worried at all. He put the super-tune on it and the thing ran great." [...] Earnhardt called the reduction in speed unnecessary: [...] "The track is safe... I don't feel (the late change in plate size) is a very fair situation for everybody. Once you're up around the 190s, what's two miles an hour? I don't see what the big deal is. The speed average is up because the corner speed remains better with the new asphalt. As far as running in a straight line, we're no faster than we've always run here." [...] Despite the mandated change, NASCAR did not schedule an additional practice session.|$|E
500|$|Although well {{received}} upon its premiere, critical opinion {{as to the}} merit of The Wood Nymph has varied. Following the 1895 premiere, Oskar Merikanto, writing in Päivälehti, praised Sibelius for having [...] "masterfully" [...] recreated Rydberg's plot {{with the use of}} [...] "unique and fascinating colors", while critic Karl Flodin complained in Nya Pressen that it was [...] "unquestionably too long". Modern day opinion has been similarly equivocal. While <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Wood Nymph contains [...] "some splendid melodic ideas" [...] and [...] "luxuriant scoring", Erik Tawaststjerna has characterized the work as the [...] "experiment" [...] of a composer [...] "still trying to find his feet as a tone-poet", suggesting that Sibelius is too dependent on the source material's narrative structure. Murtomäki, though praising the ballade for its [...] "unforced freshness of vision and tonal audacity" [...] and [...] "well elaborated, original and inventive characters", agrees with Tawaststjerna that The Wood Nymph is too episodic in construction: ...|$|E

500|$|According to Palmer, it is arguable that Delius gained {{his sense}} of {{direction}} as a composer from his French contemporary Claude Debussy. Palmer identifies aesthetic similarities between the two, and points to several parallel characteristics and enthusiasms. Both were inspired early in their careers by Grieg, both admired Chopin; they are also linked in their musical depictions of the sea, and in their uses of the wordless voice. The opening of Brigg Fair is described by Palmer as [...] "perhaps the most Debussian [...] moment in Delius". Debussy, {{in a review of}} Delius's Two Danish Songs for soprano and orchestra given in a concert on 16 March 1901, wrote: [...] "They are very sweet, very pale—music to soothe convalescents in well-to-do neighbourhoods". Delius admired the French composer's orchestration, but thought his works lacking in melody—the latter a comment frequently directed against Delius's own music. Fenby, however, draws attention to Delius's [...] "flights of melodic poetic-prose", while <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> composer was contemptuous of public taste, of [...] "giving the public what they wanted" [...] in the form of pretty tunes.|$|E
500|$|The first Paris performance, on 14 November 1958, was disastrous. According to Stephen Walsh, Pierre Boulez {{failed to}} fulfil his {{undertaking}} to obtain adequate performers, {{and those that}} he could obtain broke down several times. The audience response was polite at first, but when Stravinsky refused to return and take a bow, it gradually descended into jeers. Stravinsky said he would never conduct in Paris again. Stravinsky felt humiliated by {{what he called a}} [...] "scandalous concert", writing in his diary immediately after the performance that it was the [...] "unhappiest concert of my life" [...] and blaming Boulez for the result. Robert Craft adds that Boulez had promised to rehearse Threni, but failed to do so. Stravinsky nevertheless had a share in the blame for not cancelling the concert despite the pleas of family and friends, including his wife and Nadia Boulanger. <b>Conceding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> performance was a [...] "catastrophe", Boulez nevertheless insisted that he did in fact participate in the piano rehearsals, together with Stravinsky, whom he had tried in vain to persuade to be more firm with the singers. He concluded that Stravinsky [...] "was not a good conductor; he was a terribly lousy conductor", and the problems with the singers were compounded because [...] "the orchestra had been ill-prepared by Craft". While agreeing that the singers were [...] "absolutely awful", Boulez protested they had been chosen not by himself, but by an {{agent in charge of the}} Aix-en-Provence festival.|$|E
500|$|The British were {{initially}} confused {{as to the}} cause of the sinking, suspecting either an on-board explosion or aerial attack. Once it was realised that a submarine attack was the most likely explanation, steps were rapidly made to seal the anchorage, but U-47 had already escaped and was on its way back to Germany. The BBC released news of the sinking by late morning on 14 October, and its broadcasts were received by the German listening services and by U-47 itself. Divers sent down on the morning after the explosion discovered remnants of a German torpedo, confirming the means of attack. On 17 October First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill officially announced the loss of Royal Oak to the House of Commons, first <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> raid had been [...] "a remarkable exploit of professional skill and daring", but then declaring that the loss would not materially affect the naval balance of power. An Admiralty Board of Enquiry convened between 18 and 24 October to establish the circumstances under which the anchorage had been penetrated. In the meantime, the Home Fleet was ordered to remain at safer ports until security issues at Scapa could be addressed. Churchill was obliged to respond to questions in the House as to why Royal Oak had had aboard so many Boys, most of whom lost their lives. He defended the Royal Navy tradition of sending boys aged 15 to 17 to sea, but the practice was generally discontinued shortly after the disaster, and under 18-year-olds served on active warships in only the most exceptional circumstances.|$|E

500|$|Sheen's {{breakthrough}} {{role was}} as British politician Tony Blair in 2003's The Deal. The Channel 4 film explored the so-called Granita pact made by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown {{prior to the}} 1994 Labour Party leadership election, and was the actor's first collaboration with screenwriter Peter Morgan. Director Stephen Frears cast him because [...] "he was in Mary Reilly and I knew he was brilliant." [...] Filmed while he was playing Caligula nightly on stage, Sheen has remarked, [...] "It's interesting that in searching for monsters to play, you often end up playing leaders." [...] The Daily Telegraph praised his [...] "earnest, yet steely, portrayal" [...] while The Guardian found him [...] "excellent. This is intelligent and honest casting." [...] In 2004, Sheen starred in ITV's Dirty Filthy Love, a comic film about a man dealing with OCD and Tourette's after a marital separation. Sheen spoke of [...] "treading a fine line" [...] because [...] "a lot of the symptoms are intrinsically comical". He {{was nominated for a}} BAFTA Award for Best Television Actor and a RTS Best Actor Award. Also in 2004, Sheen played a pompous rock star in the romantic comedy Laws of Attraction and produced and starred in The Banker, which won a BAFTA Award for Best Short Film. In 2005, Sheen starred in the National Theatre's production of The UN Inspector, a David Farr adaptation of The Government Inspector. The Times wrote of [...] "a scathingly brilliant and inventive performance" [...] while Variety noted that the actor [...] "adds comic finesse to his apparently ceaseless repertoire". The Evening Standard, while <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> performance was [...] "technically brilliant", expressed bemusement as to why [...] "one of the most mercurial and inspiring actors we have seems set on impersonating Rik Mayall throughout". Also that year, he took part in the Old Vic's 24 Hour Play, in which The Telegraph felt he [...] "dazzled". In 2005 film work, Sheen starred in Dead Long Enough, a small-budget Welsh/Irish film, with his longtime friend, Jason Hughes. In addition, he had a supporting role in Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven, made a cameo appearance in The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse and starred in the short film The Open Doors.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 3 out of 4 stars, praising it as [...] "a skillfully {{assembled}} 130minutes at the movies, with actors {{capable of doing}} absurd things with straight faces, and action sequences that toy idly with the laws of physics", while Richard Corliss of Time considered it [...] "maybe the first great film of the post-human era". The New York Times said it deftly combined action and humor, stating [...] "The only time you won't be watching the screen is when your eyes have squeezed shut because you're laughing so hard." [...] The Telegraph appreciated the presence of Johnson and Diesel together, calling it a [...] "cosmic event", and added that director Lin had revitalized the series, saying [...] "the start and finish here, defying every imaginable law of physics, are series highs." [...] Empire also heaped praise on Johnson, saying [...] "How to re-ignite an ageing franchise? Drop [...] on it. The best thing, by far, in Fast Five ... Dwayne Johnson hulks through the movie leaving testosterone trails in his wake." [...] However, Empire took {{the view that the}} film itself was [...] "not, by any normal criteria, a good film", arguing that it was too long, although <b>conceding</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> action scenes, in particular the final car chase, made the film [...] "the most entertaining in the series." [...] Anna Smith of Time Out London also commented that the film was too long and criticized the simplistic characters and dialog, but she called the film [...] "slick" [...] and stated that these criticisms could be overlooked because [...] "it doesn't take itself too seriously." [...] Variety focused on the roles of Johnson and Diesel, lamenting the current lack of 1980s-style [...] "brawny" [...] leading men and of the [...] "manly men" [...] typical of the 1950s and 1960s, and calling their pairing [...] "a welcome injection of tough-guy vigor". Variety commented that, based on Fast Five, a [...] "sixth entry could be something worth waiting for". The New Yorker called the action scenes [...] "spectacular", praising director Lin by saying his [...] "direction and the sharp editing never confuse or lose momentum", but also found the film too long and criticized the dialog, labeling it [...] "subpar [...] Ocean's Eleven-style banter". [...] On the characters, The New Yorker considered Walker and Diesel [...] "serviceable", but singled out Johnson for praise for bringing a [...] "hip, comic knowingness to his role ... his enjoyment is infectious and keeps the movie speeding along." ...|$|E
