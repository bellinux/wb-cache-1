25|$|Another {{improvement}} over standard AM is obtained through reduction or {{suppression of the}} carrier component of the modulated spectrum. In Figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands; even with full (100%) sine wave modulation, the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands, yet it carries no unique information. Thus {{there is a great}} advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier, either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband (single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission) or with both sidebands remaining (double sideband suppressed carrier). While these suppressed carrier transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power, they require more sophisticated receivers employing synchronous detection and regeneration of the carrier frequency. For that reason, standard AM continues to be widely used, especially in broadcast transmission, to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using envelope detection. Even (analog) television, with a (largely) suppressed lower sideband, includes sufficient <b>carrier</b> <b>power</b> for use of envelope detection. But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.|$|E

50|$|Another {{advantage}} of negative modulation is that, since the synchronizing pulses represent maximum <b>carrier</b> <b>power,</b> {{it is relatively}} easy to arrange the receiver automatic gain control to only operate during sync pulses and thus get a constant amplitude video signal to drive the rest of the TV set.

Firstly, 3 G SCs are characterized by being inexpensive, sustainable, energy efficient, self-organized, and easy-to-install. 3 G technology also allows using cheap terminals. Secondly, because of the difficult access to the fixed electric power grid in isolated areas (usually due to geographical or economic reasons), the use of solar panels and batteries makes the whole access network energy sustainable and low cost.|$|R

50|$|A {{mobile handset}} which {{is moving in}} a cell will record a signal {{strength}} that varies. Signal strength is subject to slow fading, fast fading and interference from other signals, resulting in degradation of the carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I). A high C/I ratio yields quality communication. A good C/I ratio is achieved in cellular systems by using optimum power levels through the power control of most links. When <b>carrier</b> <b>power</b> is too high, excessive interference is created, degrading the C/I ratio for other traffic and reducing the traffic capacity of the radio subsystem. When <b>carrier</b> <b>power</b> is too low, C/I is too low and QoS targets are not met.|$|E
