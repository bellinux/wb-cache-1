The <b>co-axiality</b> accuracy is determined by optical-centering accuracy of single optical unit, which {{is determined by the}} rotating accuracy of lathe and the optical-centering judgment accuracy. When the rotating accuracy of 0. 2 um can be achieved, the leading error can be ignored. An axis-determination tool which is based on the principle of auto-collimation can be used to determine the only position of centerscope is designed. The only position is the position where the optical axis of centerscope is coincided with the rotating axis of the lathe. Also a new optical-centering judgment method is presented. A system which includes the axis-determination tool and the new optical-centering judgment method can enhance the optical-centering accuracy to 0. 003 mm. © 2014 SPIE.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the power dissipation patterns of different TSV interconnect configurations {{which could be}} employed in 3 D IC. 1 -TSV, 2 -TSV, 3 -TSV (straight line configuration, triangular configuration) and 6 -TSV (rectangular configuration, hexagonal configuration) systems have been analyzed using the FEM based software Comsol Multiphysics (ver 4. 2 a). Co-axial variation of the TSV has {{been included in the}} analysis. The simulation results show that a single cuboidal TSV has considerably more power dissipation than a single cylindrical TSV and hence has been neglected in further analyses in favor of the cylindrical TSVs. The triangular configuration of 3 -TSV system is found to have lesser power dissipation than the straight line configuration, although the peak power dissipationis more in the triangular configuration. In the case of 6 -TSV system, the rectangular and hexagonal configurations have approximately same power dissipation, though the peak power dissipationis slightly higher in the case of rectangular configuration. The consequences of power dissipation patterns in multi-TSV systems for thermal mitigation are discussed. Finally it is shown that coaxial TSV outperforms cylindrical TSV in terms of power dissipation. Misalignments during fabrication process could lead to deviations from ideal <b>co-axiality,</b> the effect of which is also analyze...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe present {{analytical}} {{predictions of}} the depth and onset slope of the steady surface flow of a cohesive granular material in an inclined channel The rheology of Jop, Forterre & Pouliquen (Nature, vol. 441, 2006, pp. 727 - 730) is used, assuming <b>co-axiality</b> between the stress and strain-rate tensors, and a coefficient of friction dependent on the strain rate through the dimensionless inertial number I. This theological law is augmented by a constant stress representing cohesion. Our analysis does not rely on a precise mu (I) functional, but only on its asymptotic power law {{in the limit of}} vanishing strain rates. Assuming a unidirectional flow, the Navier Stokes equations can be solved explicitly to yield parametric equations of the iso-velocity lines in the plane perpendicular to the flow. Two types of channel walls are considered: rough and smooth, depicting walls whose friction coefficient is respectively larger or smaller than that of the flowing material. The steady flow starts above a critical onset angle and consists of a sheared zone confined between a surface plug flow and a deep dead zone. The details of the flow are discussed, depending on dimensionless parameters relating the static friction coefficient, cohesion strength of the material, incline angle, wall friction, and channel width. The depths of the flow at the centre of the channel and at the walls are calculated by a force balance on the flowing material. The critical angle for the onset of the flow is also calculated, and is found to be strongly dependent on the channel width, in agreement with experimental results on heap stability and in rotating drums. Our results predict the important conclusion that a cohesive material always starts to flow for an incline angle lower than 90 between smooth walls, whereas in a narrow enough channel with rough walls, it may not flow, even if the channel is inclined vertically...|$|E
