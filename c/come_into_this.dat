500|$|While in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in 2005, Cumberbatch and {{two friends}} were {{abducted}} overnight and held at gunpoint {{by a group}} of locals. Eventually their abductors drove them into unsettled territory and set them free without explanation. Cumberbatch said of the incident: [...] "It taught me that you <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> world as you leave it, on your own. It's made me want to live a life less ordinary." [...] He subscribes to Buddhist philosophy and has expressed affinity for meditation and mindfulness.|$|E

Under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, {{it is also possible}} to commit a racially aggravated assault. This is where the commission of the assault in combination to hostility towards the victim, based on their race or believed race, or association with a race. [...] "Race" [...] includes skin colour, nationality, citizenship, and ethnic or national origins. Administering poison, either contrary to section 23 or 24 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, is also an offence; as is false imprisonment [...] including unlawful arrest, kidnap and hostage situations. [...] Legislation aimed at the possession or use of firearms may also <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> category, as may bomb hoaxes.|$|E

500|$|Newcomers Amanda Detmer and Chad E. Donella {{were cast}} as {{students}} Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner, respectively. [...] "When I first read the script, {{the thing that}} struck me most was that the characters were well-written and the relationships between them were strong and believable," [...] Detmer said. [...] "That's important, {{because you have to}} care about these people in order to be worried about what might happen to them". [...] Detmer defined Terry as [...] "very put-together [...] seems content to defer to [...] – to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her". On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself. [...] "I believe in fate. I think you <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> life with some things to accomplish and you're taken out earlier or later depending on the game plan".|$|E
500|$|Given his {{brilliance}} in {{home games}} in 1962, {{it was no}} surprise that Pierce was chosen to start the Giants' home opener in 1963, and he responded with the last shutout of his career – a 7–0 win over the Houston Colt [...]45s. He achieved his Candlestick success despite often discarding one of his primary pitches, the low curve, saying, [...] "How many left-handers <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> park and win with that pitch on a windy afternoon?" [...] He instead altered the location of his pitches, throwing outside to left-handers to get them to hit to left field, taking advantage of the wind which kept the ball in the air longer; two-time AL batting champion Pete Runnels observed that Pierce pitched to him completely differently upon changing leagues. His home win streak ended in his next start on April 20, a 4–0 loss to the Chicago Cubs; he gradually moved to the bullpen {{over the course of the}} 1963 season, and was used almost exclusively in relief in 1964. On September 10, 1964 against the Dodgers, in what was later called [...] "Billy the Kid's last fight," [...] he made his first start in over a year and the last of his career, pitching 7⅔ innings and gaining a 5–1 win. He made one more appearance in relief on October 3, falling one strikeout short of 2,000, and announced his retirement the next day as the season came to an end. In an 18-season career, Pierce posted a 211–169 record with a 3.27 ERA in 3,306⅔ innings; only twice (1948 and 1963) did he post an ERA of 4.00 or higher, and never in a season of at least 100 innings. He completed 193 of his 432 starts, including 38 shutouts, and also had 32 saves among his 585 total games pitched. His 186 career victories with the White Sox rank fourth on the club's all-time list, behind Hall of Famers Ted Lyons, Red Faber and Ed Walsh. His White Sox record of 456 career games by a left-hander was broken by Wilbur Wood in 1974.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of Ben-Hurs publication, the idea of {{presenting}} Christ and the Crucifixion in a fictional novel was a sensitive issue. Wallace's depiction of Christ could have been considered by some as blasphemy, but {{the quality of his}} manuscript and his assurances that he had not intended to offend Christians with his writing overcame the publisher's reservations. Harper praised it as [...] "the most beautiful manuscript that has ever <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> house. A bold experiment to make Christ a hero that has been often tried and always failed." [...] Harper and Brothers offered Wallace a contract that would earn him ten percent in royalties and published Ben-Hur on November 12, 1880. It initially sold for $1.50 per copy, an expensive price when compared to other popular novels published at the time.|$|E

2500|$|At the 1972 {{election}} Whitlam defeated McMahon {{and became}} Prime Minister. This created a potentially awkward situation since Whitlam and Hasluck had bitterly resented {{one another for}} years. In a celebrated incident in the House of Representatives in 1965, Whitlam had thrown {{a glass of water}} at Hasluck after Hasluck said: [...] "You are one of the filthiest objects ever to <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> chamber". Improbably enough in view of this, the Governor-General and the PM treated each other with complete civility that soon became genuine mutual respect. They had no difficulties in their formal dealings. An indication of the change which had taken place occurred soon after Whitlam's victory. Normal practice called for McMahon to stay on as caretaker Prime Minister until Labor could choose a full ministry at its first caucus meeting. [...] However, Whitlam was unwilling to wait that long, and asked Hasluck to have Whitlam and his deputy leader, Lance Barnard, sworn in as an interim two-man government once Labor's victory was beyond doubt. [...] Hasluck promptly agreed, and Whitlam and Barnard held 27 portfolios between them until the full Labor ministry was sworn in.|$|E
