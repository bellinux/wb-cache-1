5|$|The reforms {{implemented}} by Djedkare are generally assessed negatively in modern Egyptology as his policy of decentralization created a virtual feudal system that transferred much {{power to the}} high and provincial administrations. Some Egyptologists such as Naguib Kanawati argue that this contributed heavily {{to the collapse of}} the Egyptian state during the First Intermediate Period, c. 200 years later. These <b>conclusions</b> <b>are</b> rejected by Nigel Strudwick, who says that in spite of Djedkare's reforms, Ancient Egyptian officials never amassed enough power to rival that of the king.|$|E
5|$|The {{validity}} of the Euclidean algorithm can be proven by a two-step argument. In the first step, the final nonzero remainder r'N−1 is shown to divide both a and b. Since {{it is a common}} divisor, it must be {{less than or equal to}} the greatest common divisor g. In the second step, it is shown that any common divisor of a and b, including g, must divide r'N−1; therefore, g must be less than or equal to r'N−1. These two <b>conclusions</b> <b>are</b> inconsistent unless r'N−1 = g.|$|E

25|$|Morris's {{conclusions}} were skewed {{with respect}} to the evidence he himself presents, and when the <b>conclusions</b> <b>are</b> harsh for the Israelis he tended to give them a less incriminating spin.|$|E

50|$|A {{deductive}} {{argument is}} one that, if valid, has a <b>conclusion</b> that <b>is</b> entailed by its premises. In other words, {{the truth of}} the <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> a logical consequence of the premises—if the premises are true, then the <b>conclusion</b> must <b>be</b> true. It would be self-contradictory to assert the premises and deny the conclusion, because the negation of the <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> contradictory to {{the truth of the}} premises.|$|R

25|$|In 2007, DNA {{evidence}} {{questioned the}} identification of the body found in Crippen's cellar {{that was supposed to be}} Crippen's wife.

40|$|Reference is made {{to recent}} studies by Barnes et al. (1983) and Hide (1984) in which a <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> made that {{atmospheric}} excitation alone is sufficient {{to account for the}} earth's polar motion over the studied periods. It is then shown through a physical 'thought' experiment and a numerical simulation that this <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> unjustified since the information about the Chandler wobble presented in these papers is insufficient.

50|$|One of White's <b>conclusions</b> <b>is</b> that no {{one system}} of {{government}} is obviously more murderous, and anarchy can be worst of all.

25|$|A {{reference}} that names {{an imaginary}} source {{is in some}} sense also a self-reference. A self-reference automatically makes a comment about itself. Premises that name themselves as premises are premises by self-reference; conclusions that name themselves as <b>conclusions</b> <b>are</b> conclusions by self-reference.|$|E
25|$|International {{groups are}} {{studying}} much higher penetrations (30-100% renewable energy), and <b>conclusions</b> <b>are</b> that these levels are also technically feasible.

5000|$|Agreed-upon {{procedures}} do {{not constitute}} an assurance procedure under the above definition, because no <b>conclusion</b> <b>is</b> given.

25|$|Wiercinski's {{research}} methods and <b>conclusions</b> <b>are</b> not {{accepted by the}} vast majority of Mesoamerican scholars, in part because of his reliance on the Polish Comparative-Morphological methodology which limits the placement of skull types within a very narrow spectrum that is often within Caucasian, Negroid, and Mongoloid. Native Americans are thus made to fit within these groups which often yields false and contradictory assumptions as a result of sample bias.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} these {{anomalies}} {{forms the basis}} of gravitational geophysics. The fluctuations are measured with highly sensitive gravimeters, the effect of topography and other known factors is subtracted, and from the resulting data <b>conclusions</b> <b>are</b> drawn. Such techniques are now used by prospectors to find oil and mineral deposits. Denser rocks (often containing mineral ores) cause higher than normal local gravitational fields on the Earth's surface. Less dense sedimentary rocks cause the opposite.|$|E
25|$|In De l'Art de {{persuader}} ("On the Art of Persuasion"), Pascal looked {{deeper into}} geometry's axiomatic method, specifically {{the question of}} how people come to be convinced of the axioms upon which later <b>conclusions</b> <b>are</b> based. Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths.|$|E

25|$|Whilst advising {{that further}} studies {{in lots of}} {{different}} eusocial and non-eusocial taxa are required to better assess the validity of these assumptions, Meunier notes {{that the existence of}} a trade-off between personal and social immunity could be masked or erroneously 'discovered' in a population/species due to individual variation (e.g. low-quality individuals {{may not be able to}} afford relatively high investment into both immune systems), and thus recommends that the intrinsic quality of individuals should be controlled for if valid <b>conclusions</b> <b>are</b> to be drawn.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{studies have}} been {{utilised}} {{in the study of}} pre-historic population movements. On the whole, scientists agree that there is evidence for a migration during the Neolithic. However, they cannot agree on the extent of this movement. The conclusions of studies appear to be 'operator dependent'. That is, results vary depending on what underlying mutation rates are assumed, and <b>conclusions</b> <b>are</b> drawn from how the authors 'envisage' their results fit with known archaeological and historic processes. Consequently, such studies must be interpreted with caution.|$|E
25|$|The {{elemental}} composition of Mars {{is different from}} Earth′s in several significant ways. First, Martian meteorite analysis suggests that the planet's mantle is about twice as rich in iron as the Earth's mantle. Second, its core is more rich in sulphur. Third, the Martian mantle is richer in potassium and phosphorus than Earth's and fourth, the Martian crust contains {{a higher percentage of}} volatile elements such as sulphur and chlorine than the Earth's crust does. Many of these <b>conclusions</b> <b>are</b> supported by in situ analyses of rocks and soils on the Martian surface.|$|E
