5|$|Madagascar's natural {{resources}} include {{a variety of}} unprocessed agricultural and mineral resources. Agriculture (including raffia), fishing and forestry are mainstays of the economy. Madagascar is the world's principal supplier of vanilla, <b>cloves</b> <b>and</b> ylang-ylang. Other key agricultural resources include coffee, lychees and shrimp. Key mineral resources include various types of precious and semi-precious stones, and Madagascar currently provides half of the world's supply of sapphires, which were discovered near Ilakaka in the late 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Exports formed 28percent of GDP in 2009. Most of the country's {{export revenue}} {{is derived from}} the {{textiles}} industry, fish and shellfish, vanilla, <b>cloves</b> <b>and</b> other foodstuffs. France is Madagascar's main trading partner, although the United States, Japan and Germany also have strong economic ties to the country. The Madagascar-U.S. Business Council was formed in May 2003, as a collaboration between USAID and Malagasy artisan producers to support the export of local handicrafts to foreign markets. Imports of such items as foodstuffs, fuel, capital goods, vehicles, consumer goods and electronics consume an estimated 52percent of GDP. The main sources of Madagascar's imports include China, France, Iran, Mauritius and Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of vaporizer and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, <b>cloves</b> <b>and</b> sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E
40|$|Pathogens are {{the most}} {{important}} factors inducing postharvest losses on citrus fruit. Experiments were conducted as a CRD with 4 replications on sweet lime (Citrus limetta) and Valencia orange (Citrus sinensis) in 2003 and 2004. Treatments were pure essential oils of <b>clove</b> <b>and</b> thyme and in 25 % ethanol solution at concentrations of 0. 1, 0. 3 and 0. 5 % and imazalil (2 ml/l). Results indicated that in the first year, pure essential oils of <b>clove</b> <b>and</b> thyme reduced the decay percentage of blue mold of Valencia orange fruit from 90 % (control) to 0 and 12. 5 %, respectively. Pure essential oils of <b>clove</b> <b>and</b> thyme reduced the decay percentage of sweet lime {{in the first year of}} experiment from 95 % (control) to 0 and 6 %, respectively. In the second year, with the same treatments decay percentage of blue mold was reduced from 90 % (control) to 0. Solutions of 0. 1, 0. 3 and 0. 5 % of <b>clove</b> <b>and</b> thyme oil extracts in 25 % ethanol solution reduced decay percentage of sweet lime fruits form 85 % (control) to 65, 41 and 26 % for thyme oil and to 60, 30 and 22. 5 % for clove oil. Comparison of pure <b>clove</b> <b>and</b> thyme oil extract with imazalil showed that pure <b>clove</b> <b>and</b> thyme oil extracts were not significantly different with fungicide treatment.

25|$|In 1619, Jan Pieterszoon Coen was {{appointed}} Governor-General of the VOC. He saw {{the possibility of}} the VOC becoming an Asian power, both political and economic. On 30 May 1619, Coen, backed by a force of nineteen ships, stormed Jayakarta, driving out the Banten forces; and from the ashes established Batavia as the VOC headquarters. In the 1620s almost the entire native population of the Banda Islands was driven away, starved to death, or killed in an attempt to replace them with Dutch plantations. These plantations were used to grow <b>cloves</b> <b>and</b> nutmeg for export. Coen hoped to settle large numbers of Dutch colonists in the East Indies, but implementation of this policy never materialised, mainly because very few Dutch were willing to emigrate to Asia.|$|E
25|$|Mezcal {{is highly}} varied, {{depending}} on the species of agave used, the fruits and herbs added during fermentation and the distillation process employed, creating subtypes with names such as de gusano, tobalá, pechuga, blanco, minero, cedrón, de alacran, creme de café and more. A special recipe for a specific mezcal type known as pechuga uses cinnamon, apple, plums, <b>cloves,</b> <b>and</b> other spices that is then distilled through chicken, duck, or turkey breast. It is made when the specific fruits used in the recipe are available, usually during November or December. Other variations flavor the mash with cinnamon, pineapple slices, red bananas, and sugar, each imparting a particular character to the mezcal. Most mezcal, however, is left untouched, allowing the flavors of the agave used to come forward.|$|E

25|$|The VOC {{was granted}} a charter to wage war, build fortresses, and make {{treaties}} across Asia. A capital was established in Batavia (now Jakarta), which became {{the centre of the}} VOC's Asian trading network. To their original monopolies on nutmeg, peppers, <b>cloves</b> <b>and</b> cinnamon, the company and later colonial administrations introduced non-indigenous cash crops like coffee, tea, cacao, tobacco, rubber, sugar and opium, and safeguarded their commercial interests by taking over surrounding territory. Smuggling, the ongoing expense of war, corruption, and mismanagement led to bankruptcy {{by the end of the}} 18th century. The company was formally dissolved in 1800 and its colonial possessions in the Indonesian archipelago (including much of Java, parts of Sumatra, much of Maluku, and the hinterlands of ports such as Makasar, Manado, and Kupang) were nationalised under the Dutch Republic as the Dutch East Indies.|$|E

25|$|Mamluk Egypt {{was a major}} {{producer}} of textiles and a supplier of raw materials for Western Europe. However, the frequent outbreaks of the Black Plague led {{to a decline in}} the Mamluk territories' production of goods such as textiles, silk products, sugar, glass, soaps, and paper, which coincided with the Europeans' increasing production of these goods. Trade continued nonetheless and despite papal restrictions on trade with the Muslims during the Crusades. Mediterranean trade was dominated by spices, such as pepper, muscat nuts and flowers, <b>cloves</b> <b>and</b> cinnamon, as well as medicinal drugs and indigo. These goods originated in Persia, India, and Southeast Asia and made their way to Europe via the Mamluk ports of Syria and Egypt. These ports were frequented by European merchants, who in turn sold gold and silver ducats and bullions, silk, wool and linen fabrics, furs, wax, honey and cheeses.|$|E

25|$|In 1345, Ibn Battuta {{travelled}} on to Samudra Pasai Sultanate {{in present-day}} Aceh, Northern Sumatra, where he {{notes in his}} travel log that the ruler of Samudra Pasai was a pious Muslim named Sultan Al-Malik Al-Zahir Jamal-ad-Din, who performed his religious duties with utmost zeal and often waged campaigns against animists in the region. The island of Sumatra, according to Ibn Battuta, was rich in camphor, areca nut, <b>cloves,</b> <b>and</b> tin. The madh'hab he observed was Imam Al-Shafi‘i, whose customs {{were similar to those}} he had previously seen in coastal India, especially among the Mappila Muslims, who were also followers of Imam Al-Shafi‘i. At that time Samudra Pasai marked the end of Dar al-Islam, because no territory east of this was ruled by a Muslim.

25|$|Even {{prior to}} the {{penetration}} of European interests, Southeast Asia was {{a critical part of}} the world trading system. A wide range of commodities originated in the region, but especially important were spices such as pepper, ginger, <b>cloves,</b> <b>and</b> nutmeg. The spice trade initially was developed by Indian and Arab merchants, but it also brought Europeans to the region. First Spaniards (Manila galleon) and Portuguese, then the Dutch, and finally the British and French became involved in this enterprise in various countries. The penetration of European commercial interests gradually evolved into annexation of territories, as traders lobbied for an extension of control to protect and expand their activities. As a result, the Dutch moved into Indonesia, the British into Malaya and parts of Borneo, the French into Indochina, and the Spanish and the US into the Philippines. An economic effect of this imperialism was the shift in the production of commodities. For example, the rubber plantations of Malaysia, Java, Vietnam and Cambodia, the tin mining of Malaya, the rice fields of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and Irrawaddy River delta in Burma, were a response to powerful market demands.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a common}} disease in human societies. Proteins non-enzymatic glycation has deleterious effects on the structure and function of proteins. Non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins can {{be involved in the}} pathogenesis of diabetic complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy. One way of preventing this reaction is the use of medicinal plants. Chamomile, <b>clove</b> <b>and</b> garlic are herbs which their alkaloid compounds have antioxidant property. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of chamomile, <b>clove</b> <b>and</b> garlic extract on non-enzymatic glycosylation of albumin. Materials & Methods: In this experimental study, hydroalcoholic extract of chamomile, <b>clove</b> <b>and</b> garlic was prepared. In vitro albumin glycosylation reaction was carried out in presence of different concentrations (0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 1 g/L) of chamomile, <b>clove</b> <b>and</b> garlic extracts and level of glycosylated albumin was measured. Non-enzymatic glycosylation of albumin was determined by nitrobluetetrazuliom method. Absorbance changes were measured in 530 nm by Eppendorf spectrophotometer. Results: In this study, chamomile extract in 0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 1 g/L of its concentrations had respectively 9 %, 17 % and 26 %, inhibitory effect on albumin glycosylation. Albumin glycosylation reaction was inhibited 23 % by 0. 01 g/L concentration of <b>clove</b> <b>and</b> garlic extracts and the level of inhibition of albumin glycosylation decreased by increasing of extracts concentration. Chamomile extract with 0. 1 g/L concentration has the most effect among the studied extracts. Conclusion: In this study, chamomile extract inhibited the in vitro albumin glycosylation reaction. <b>Clove</b> <b>and</b> garlic extracts showed inhibitory effect in low concentration but this effect decreased with increasing of the extract concentration...|$|R

50|$|Tereza Batista: Home {{from the}} Wars {{is one of}} Jorge Amado's later novels. While his earlier work {{provided}} a left-wing criticism {{of the economic and}} environmental exploitation of Brazil, the later novels, beginning with Gabriela, <b>Clove</b> <b>and</b> Cinnamon, became more of a celebration of Brazilian sensuality, accompanied by a fascination with candomblé and the religious influences brought over from Africa. Tereza Batista, the seventh novel after Gabriela, <b>Clove</b> <b>and</b> Cinnamon, is in the same vein, showing affection for the poor of Bahia together with an emphasis on prostitutes and candomblé. He continues in Tereza Batista to use oral narrative with roots in the tradition of popular poetry and folklore. The novel thus contains similarities with another earlier work, Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands <b>and</b> with Gabriela, <b>Clove</b> <b>and</b> Cinnamon in its treatment of love, its social critique, and the atmosphere of Salvador, together with critical portraits of the rich, contrasted with a sympathetic approach to the poor.|$|R
