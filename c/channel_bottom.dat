5000|$|Check dams have {{traditionally}} been implemented in two main environments: across <b>channel</b> <b>bottoms</b> and on hilly slopes. [...] Check dams are used primarily to control water velocity, conserve soil, and improve land. They are used when other flow-control practices, such as lining the channel or creating bioswales is impractical. Accordingly, they are commonly used in degrading temporary channels, in which permanent stabilization is impractical and infeasible in terms of resource allocation and funding due to the short life period. Or, they are used when construction delays and weather conditions prevent timely installation of other erosion control practices. This is typically seen during the construction process of large-scale permanent dams or erosion control. As such, check dams serve as temporary grade-control mechanisms along waterways until resolute stabilization is established or along permanent swales that need protection prior to installation of a non-erodible lining.|$|R

30|$|The main {{difference}} is that the sediment concentration of the exiting flow is now independent of the hydrodynamic conditions in the adjacent bays and tidal flats but is governed by physical processes mobilizing sediments within the salt marsh. Wind waves are negligible on marsh platforms, given the shallow water depths and the damping effect of vegetation (Möller et al. 1999). Therefore only tidal currents triggering high velocities are potentially responsible for sediment mobilization on the marsh surface during ebb, although field evidence seems to indicate that this effect is limited. Most of the sediment is therefore eroded and resuspended from the <b>channels</b> <b>bottom</b> and banks, where the velocities are high and vegetation does not protect the substrate. Data from Louisiana confirm that sediment concentration in the water exiting a marsh during ebb is proportional to the tidal velocity in the channel (Figure  5 B) (Fagherazzi and Priestas 2010).|$|R

Turbulence created from this jet can be near the <b>channel</b> <b>bottom</b> at one instant and then suddenly transition to the water surface. This oscillation of the jet causes irregular waves to form, which can propagate for long distances downstream of the jump, potentially causing damage and degradation of the channel banks.|$|E

For each break that was found, workers repaired it by cutting out the faulty section and then splicing in a new section of cable. Once the cable was fully repaired, it was then placed back on the <b>channel</b> <b>bottom</b> and reburied by jetting. The entire project was completed by late February 2010.|$|E
50|$|A {{stream bed}} is the <b>channel</b> <b>bottom</b> of a stream, river or creek, the {{physical}} confine {{of the normal}} water flow. The lateral confines or channel margins are known as the stream banks or river banks, during all but flood stage. Under certain conditions a river can branch from one stream bed to multiple stream beds. A flood occurs when a stream overflows its banks and flows onto its flood plain. As a general rule, the bed {{is the part of}} the channel up to the normal water line, and the banks are that part above the normal water line. However, because water flow varies, this differentiation is subject to local interpretation. Usually, the bed is kept clear of terrestrial vegetation, whereas the banks are subjected to water flow only during unusual or perhaps infrequent high water stages and therefore might support vegetation some or much of the time.|$|E

50|$|A lake {{discharges}} to {{a rectangular}} channel with a given width, hydraulic roughness and slope. Discharge {{at the lake}} outlet will vary based on the normal depth calculated from the lake and channel characteristics. Channel roughness is a characteristic described by the Gauckler-Manning coefficient (also called Manning's n). Channel roughness can be determined using Manning's Roughness Coefficients which describes the channel in terms of vegetation and size of bed sediment. Channel slope can be found using topographic maps to determine changes in elevation along the channel. The level of the lake (y) above the outlet is used for determining discharge, and can be determined by measuring the lake level relative to the <b>channel</b> <b>bottom.</b> The normal depth is the depth of water under conditions of uniform flow. Figure 1 provides a visual representation of the steps described above to determine the discharge at a lake outlet.|$|E
50|$|The foreset beds in turn are {{deposited}} in inclined layers over the bottomset beds as the active lobe advances. Foreset beds form {{the greater part}} of the bulk of a delta, (and also occur on the lee side of sand dunes). The sediment particles within foreset beds consist of larger and more variable sizes, and constitute the bed load that the river moves downstream by rolling and bouncing along the <b>channel</b> <b>bottom.</b> When the bed load reaches the edge of the delta front, it rolls over the edge, and is {{deposited in}} steeply dipping layers {{over the top of the}} existing bottomset beds. Under water, the slope of the outermost edge of the delta is created at the angle of repose of these sediments. As the foresets accumulate and advance, subaqueous landslides occur and readjust overall slope stability. The foreset slope, thus created and maintained, extends the delta lobe outward. In cross section, foresets typically lie in angled, parallel bands, and indicate stages and seasonal variations during the creation of the delta.|$|E
50|$|In {{open channel}} flow, {{specific}} energy (E) is the energy length, or head, {{relative to the}} <b>channel</b> <b>bottom.</b> Specific energy is {{expressed in terms of}} kinetic energy, and potential energy, and internal energy. The Bernoulli equation, which originates from a control volume analysis, is used to describe specific energy relationships in fluid dynamics. The form of Bernoulli’s equation discussed here assumes the flow is incompressible and steady. The three energy components in Bernoulli's equation are elevation, pressure and velocity. However, since with open channel flow, the water surface is open to the atmosphere, the pressure term between two points has the same value and is therefore ignored. Thus, if the specific energy and the velocity of the flow in the channel are known, the depth of flow can be determined. This relationship can be used to calculate changes in depth upstream or downstream of changes in the channel such as steps, constrictions, or control structures. It is also the fundamental relationship used in the Standard Step Method to calculate how the depth of a flow changes over a reach from the energy gained or lost due to the slope of the channel.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The geomorphic {{evolution}} of many landscapes is fundamentally deter-mined by the {{evolution of}} the river channels and their interactions with hillslopes. Consequently, models of landscape evolution ought to track {{the evolution of}} the channel geometry so as to quantify the rate of erosion of <b>channel</b> <b>bottoms</b> and to follow the changes in hillslope-channel coupling over time. Unfortunately, the spatial resolution required to describe channel morphology adequately is computationally impractical. It is also beyond the resolution of most digital elevation data. What is required is a parameterization scheme for approximating fine scale channel morphol-ogy at a coarse pixel scale. Such a parameterization is already implicitly employed in most models by assuming channel equilibrium, which ties the width and depth of a model channel to the square root of discharge through a pixel. Channel fluxes are thereby predictable, and a closed form of the governing equations is attained. In reality, mountain river channels do not take a simple equilibrium form and show great spatial variability and evident disequilibrium geometry. Since the time scales of changes in channel geometry, bedrock channel erosion, and hillslope response are al...|$|R
40|$|In the {{detection}} of biomedical and biochemistry, the microfluidic chips play an important role. In order to improve the efficiency for {{the detection}}, the investigation on the velocity field must is a must. Because the different aspect ratio and the different material of the microchannel could change the velocity field, then the detecting efficiency of the microfluidic chips could be affected. Therefore, the objectives of this research were (1) to model the velocity field caused by electroosmotic flow in the rectangular microchannel, (2) to fix the cross-section area value and alter the aspect ratio of the microchannel to study the variation of the velocity field, and (3) to change the material of the <b>bottom</b> <b>channel</b> wall, and to study the variation in the microchannel associated with different aspect ratio at a fixed value of cross-section area. According to results of both the numerical simulation and experiment, in the rectangular microchannel that each channel wall was built of the same material, the velocity field in the microchannel was maining influenced by the zeta potential on the channel wall {{but not to the}} aspect ratio. In the rectangular microchannel which the material of <b>bottom</b> <b>channel</b> wall was varied to others, the zeta potential was still a major influence, however the velocity field was also influenced by the area of the <b>bottom</b> <b>channel</b> wall. In addition,for the <b>bottom</b> <b>channel</b> wall using different material to others, the result showed that the distance (Hi), which influenced by zeta potential in the velocity field on the <b>bottom</b> <b>channel</b> wall, was equal to the width of the <b>bottom</b> <b>channel</b> wall (W). 在生醫生化檢測上，微流體晶片扮演著重要的角色，為增進其檢測效率，有必要對微管道中之流場進行研究，因為不同微管道高寬比與不同管道基材的結合，有可能致使管道內之流場產生變化，而影響微流體晶片之檢測品質，故本研究之目的為（ 1 ）針對矩形微管道中電滲流（electroosmotic flow, EOF）之流場進行模擬；（ 2 ）固定矩形微管道之截面積，改變微管道之高寬比，探討矩形微管道中之流場之變化；及（ 3 ）改變微管道底面管壁之材質，討論相同截面積但不同高寬比對矩形微管道內流場分佈之影響。 由軟體模擬配合實驗之結果顯示，在管壁材質均相同的矩形微管道中，管道內之流場，主要是受到管壁上zeta potential（ζ電位）的影響，高寬比對於流場則幾無影響；在底面管壁材質不同的矩形微管道中，管壁上之zeta potential仍為主要的影響因子，但微管道內之流場變化亦會隨著不同材質之底面管壁的面積大小而有所改變。另外，研究結果顯示，不同材質之底面管壁，其zeta potential在流場內所能影響之距離（Hi）約等同於底面管壁之寬度（W）。摘要	vi Abstract	vii 目 次	viii 表 目 次	xi 圖 目 次	xii 符號表	xv 第 1 章	緒論	 1 1. 1 	前言	 1 1. 2 	研究目的與項目	 2 第 2 章	文獻探討	 3 2. 1 	微流體晶片	 3 2. 2 	電雙層的形成	 5 2. 3 	電滲流的形成	 7 2. 4 	CFD模擬軟體的應用	 11 第 3 章	材料與方法	 16 3. 1 	CFDRC之介紹	 16 3. 1. 1 	CFD-GEOM之介紹	 17 3. 1. 2 	CFD-ACE之介紹	 19 3. 1. 3 	CFD-VIEW之介紹	 20 3. 2 	基本假設	 20 3. 3 	理論基礎	 21 3. 3. 1 	電雙層分佈	 21 3. 3. 2 	外加電場之電位勢分佈方程式	 22 3. 3. 3 	流體運動方程式	 22 3. 4 	實驗參數與方法	 23 3. 4. 1 	模擬實驗參數	 23 3. 4. 2 	初始、邊界條件	 27 3. 5 	微管道之製作	 29 3. 6 	電滲流量測方法	 35 第 4 章	結果與討論	 41 4. 1 	模擬結果與實驗結果之比對	 41 4. 2 	A型與B型管道之流速比較	 44 4. 3 	高寬比對流場之影響	 46 4. 3. 1 	高寬比對A型管道流速之影響	 46 4. 3. 2 	高寬比對B型管道流速之影響	 47 第 5 章	結論	 58 參考文獻	 6...|$|R
