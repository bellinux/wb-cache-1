Governor Stevenson's fund, which proved to total $146,000, had been used for such expenditures as <b>Christmas</b> <b>gifts</b> to reporters, dues for private clubs, and to hire an orchestra for a dance his son was hosting. Taking a leaf from Nixon's book, the Democrats {{refused to answer}} questions about the governor's fund. Both parties were eager to bury the matter, and the story died.|$|E

25|$|They {{were very}} popular as <b>Christmas</b> <b>gifts,</b> however, {{and from the}} 1930s to the early 1960s, many bags were {{annually}} released to banks nationwide to be distributed as presents. In November 1962, during this annual distribution, {{it was discovered that}} there were some rare and valuable dates, still sealed in their original mint bags, all in uncirculated condition, among the millions of dollar coins still in the Treasury vaults. Collectors/investors/dealers lined up to purchase them in $1,000 bags, trading silver certificates for the coins. Before this event, the great rarity of the Morgan series was 1903-O, which was by far the most expensive of the entire set. It was discovered that there were millions of this specific date and mint in the Treasury vaults; an estimated 84% of the entire mintage sat in these bags, untouched for 60 years, all in uncirculated condition. While still relatively expensive in circulated grades, uncirculated examples can be had for a modest amount over common dates.|$|E

500|$|He was poignantly mourned in Philadelphia as {{a benevolent}} {{employer}} of over 3,000 and a rare businessman who treated his employees exceptionally well.

[...] He was reported in 1889 to give $17,000 in <b>Christmas</b> <b>gifts</b> to his employees. His philanthropy branched out in other areas as well. In 1882 he sponsored the immigration of approximately 40 or 50 Russian Jewish families and purchased homes for them, assuring they would settle in Pennsylvania.|$|E

500|$|Scholar Mary Burgher {{believes}} that female Black autobiographers like Angelou have debunked the stereotypes of African-American mothers as [...] "breeder and matriarch", and have presented them as having [...] "a creative and personally fulfilling role". Lupton {{believes that}} Angelou's plot construction and character development {{were influenced by}} the same mother/child motif as {{is found in the}} work of Harlem Renaissance poet Jessie Fauset. For {{the first five years of}} her life, Maya thinks of herself as an orphan and finds comfort in the thought that her mother is dead. [...] Maya's feelings for and relationship with her own mother, whom she blames for her abandonment, express themselves in ambivalence and [...] "repressed violent aggression". For example, Maya and her brother destroy the first <b>Christmas</b> <b>gifts</b> sent by their mother. These strong feelings are not resolved until the end of the book, when Maya becomes a mother herself, and her mother finally becomes the nurturing presence for which Maya has longed. The two main maternal influences on Maya's life change as well; Vivian becomes a more active participant, while Momma becomes less effective as Maya, by becoming a mother herself, moves from childhood to adulthood.|$|E
500|$|Pam {{says that}} her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) always makes her great <b>Christmas</b> <b>gifts</b> so {{she wants to make}} him one too. She creates a {{hand-drawn}} comic book about Jim who gets attacked by a radioactive bear and takes its powers. She asks for others' opinions before giving it to Jim, but most of them give her harsh critiques. Jim gives Pam a beautiful bracelet and he is equally amazed at the comic book she gives him. Meanwhile, Jim agrees to a snowball fight with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). When he is first challenged outside, however, he finds the doors chained. Dwight then emerges from a snowman, throwing multiple snowballs at Jim and leaving him with a bloody nose. Throughout the day, Dwight torments Jim with increasingly elaborate snowball ambushes. Jim tries to surrender, but Dwight refuses. At the end of the day, Jim is too afraid to go outside. He and Pam find multiple snowmen, and Jim attacks them all hoping to find Dwight. Dwight, however, is {{on the roof of the}} building, watching Jim with a satisfied look on his face. He claims that the most powerful snowball in a snowball fight is fear, and smilingly wishes the camera [...] "Merry Christmas".|$|E

The Mariano Rivera Foundation, which helps provide underprivileged children with an education, distributes more than $500,000 annually in the US and Panama through church-based institutions.

Since retiring from baseball, Rivera has dedicated himself to philanthropy and his churches. He and Clara have twice awarded a scholarship in their names to a student at the local College of New Rochelle. In 2012, the Giving Back Fund estimated that Rivera donated $627,500 to charity in 2010, ranking him as the 25th-most generous celebrity on a list that the fund compiled.
