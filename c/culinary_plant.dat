The {{celebration of}} mole as the {{national}} dish of Mexico draws explicitly on the biogeography of its ingredients, often read {{as a proxy for}} the cultural origins of the national character. Mole is represented as coextensive with the Republic, complex, and a synthesis of New World and Old World elements. This thesis assesses these claims with attention to the spatial and taxonomic scales at which they are made, and discusses the implications of scale in narratives of place. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies draws on the dual traditions that (in) form cultural biogeography, and reveals connections between levels of generalization and narrative implication. Determining the biogeographical value of ingredients is found to be complicated by ambiguous taxa, <b>culinary</b> <b>plant</b> complexes, and varied ways of counting. The predominant discourse of mole is found to rely on ahistorical biogeographical essentialism, which supports dichotomous constructions of nationalism, while greater attention to the particular cultural biogeographies of the foodplants, at finer scales, undermines Eurocentric narratives and recognizes the agency of multiple indigenous cultures in transdomesticating plants across varied neotropical ecosystems. Ultimately, mole can be considered representative of Mexico not so much for a single determined identity as for the complexity of its diverse and ongoing interpretations...|$|E
40|$|Background & Aims:This study {{examined}} the antioxidant activity of different extract of parsley (Petroselinum crispum) with DPPH method. This assay {{is one of the}} most commonly used because of its simplicity and efficiency. Parsley is a widely known <b>culinary</b> <b>plant</b> and herbal medicine in Europe since ancient times. It is easy to grow and many biological activities are attributed to the flavonoids in the leaf. Biological active herbal medicines have an advantage over drugs because they are safer and cheaper. Methods: The antioxidant activities of the main flavonoid and its glycosides were measured. With previously optimized extraction procedure, the effect of particle size and extraction temperature were tested regarding the radical scavenging activity and drug content with spectrophotometric and HPLC-UV method. The antioxidant capacity of the extracts for 7 days were also investigated. Results: The aglicon possesses bigger antioxidant activity over the glycosidic forms. The scavenging activity was decreased with smaller the particle size of the dried leaves and higher temperature, but the flavonoid content was increased. Conclusion: The use of medicinal plants in the therapy is emerging. The exact dose and mode of action of the medicinal plants are still an unfolding area therefore the study on the main mode of action- the antioxidant activity – influenced by the formulation is important...|$|E
40|$|Antioxidants have {{important}} role in prevention and treatment of disorders and plants are considered as rich sources of radical scavenging compounds. Nowadays, many herbs are used in dried form which is possible to affect their antioxidant activity. In the present investigation, the effects of different drying methods on the antioxidant capacity and total phenolics content of some <b>culinary</b> <b>plant</b> species have been studied. Leaves of Mentha piperita, Mentha spicata, Thymus vulgaris and Anethum graveolense were dried in sun, shade, oven and microwave and extracted with methanol. Antioxidant activity of each extract was determined by DPPH free radicals and total phenolics content was measured by folin cio-calteus reagent. The results revealed that drying process reduced the antioxidant activity of Anethum graveolense whereas sun-drying and shade-drying increased the antioxidant activity of Mentha piperita, Mentha spicata and Thymus vulgaris (Lamiaceae). During sun-drying and shade-drying, total phenolics content increased for the three plants of Lamiaceae while oven- and microwave-drying reduced the phenolics content. Drying also declined the phenolics content of Anethum graveolense which gives the conclusion {{that some kind of}} correlation could be established between total phenolics content and antioxidant behavior for the three Lamiaceae and Anethum graveolense. Our study brought the view that diversity in the methods of drying could lead to different phenolics content and antioxidant behavior, suggesting that each plant needs a special drying method...|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the ability of}} nine <b>culinary</b> <b>plant</b> extracts containing {{a wide array of}} phytochemicals to inhibit fructose uptake and then explored the involvement of intestinal fructose transporters and phytochemicals for selected samples. The chemical signature was characterized by high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Inhibition of [14 C]-fructose uptake was tested by using human intestinal Caco- 2 cells. Then, the relative contribution of the two apical-facing intestinal fructose transporters, GLUT 2 and GLUT 5, and the signature components for fructose uptake inhibition was confirmed in naive, phloretin-treated and forskolin-treated Caco- 2 cells. HPLC/MS analysis of the chemical signature revealed that guava leaf contained quercetin and catechin, and turmeric contained curcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin and dimethoxycurcumin. Similar inhibition of fructose uptake (by ~ 50 %) was observed with guava leaf and turmeric in Caco- 2 cells, but with a higher contribution of GLUT 2 for turmeric and that of GLUT 5 for guava leaf. The data suggested that, in turmeric, demethoxycurcumin specifically contributed to GLUT 2 -mediated fructose uptake inhibition, and curcumin did the same to GLUT 5 -mediated fructose uptake inhibition, but GLUT 2 inhibition was more potent. By contrast, in guava leaf, catechin specifically contributed to GLUT 5 -mediated fructose uptake inhibition, and quercetin affected both GLUT 5 - and GLUT 2 -mediated fructose uptake inhibition, resulting in the higher contribution of GLUT 5. These results suggest that demethoxycurcumin is an important contributor to GLUT 2 -mediated fructose uptake inhibition for turmeric extract, and catechin is the same to GLUT 5 -mediated fructose uptake inhibition for guava leaf extract. Quercetin, curcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin contributed to both GLUT 5 - and GLUT 2 -mediated fructose uptake inhibition, but the contribution to GLUT 5 inhibition was higher than the contribution to GLUT 2 inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Awareness of {{potential}} water {{quantity and quality}} problems has risen with recent drought conditions throughout the U. S. In 2011, Texas experienced the most intense year of drought on record and mandatory water restrictions were enacted. Residential landscapes are a primary target of such restrictions. Selection of drought tolerant native Texas groundcovers began in College Station, TX in 2009. Species included Borrichia frutescens (L.) DC., Erigeron procumbens (Houst. ex Mill.) G. L. Nesom., Mimosa strigillosa Torr. & A. Gray, Oenothera drummondii Hook. and Phyla nodiflora (L.) Greene var. nodiflora. A suite of studies was designed to investigate potential commercial viability, propagation and production in conventional systems, and relative drought tolerances of the species. A market {{study was conducted to}} assess if consumers? horticultural purchasing behaviors influenced their behaviors and attitudes regarding water conservation. Effects of propagation seasons (warm and cool), bottom heat regimes (none, 26. 7, and 35. 0 ?C), and K-IBA concentrations (ranging from 0 to 9000 mg?L^- 1) on cuttings were investigated. Viability of conventional production of the natives was studied by testing effects of seven substrates (pine bark, perlite, peat moss, and mixtures thereof) and three controlled release fertilizer levels (low, medium, and high) on growth and biomass. Mimosa strigillosa was omitted from the propagation and production experiments while all other species were propagated and produced effectively using conventional methods. Acute and chronic drought experiments tested the tolerance of distinct provenances of native species along with commercially popular exotic species. Native species were divided into use-groups such that E. procumbens, M. strigillosa, O. drummondii, and P. nodiflora were studied as groundcovers and B. frutescens was studied as a shrub. Strong tolerances to water deficits were displayed by B. frutescens, M. strigillosa, and O. drummondii. Market study research was conducted by surveying participants in Michigan and Texas.

60|$|In {{the case}} of animals the want of a proper amount of exercise, as Bechstein remarked, has perhaps played, {{independently}} of the direct effects of the disuse of any particular organ, {{an important part in}} causing variability. We can see in a vague manner that, when the organised and nutrient fluids of the body are not used during growth, or by the wear and tear of the tissues, they will be in excess; and as growth, nutrition, and reproduction are intimately allied processes, this superfluity might disturb the due and proper action of the reproductive organs, and consequently affect the character of the future offspring. But it may be argued that neither an excess of food nor a superfluity in the organised fluids of the body necessarily induces variability. The goose and the turkey have been well fed for many generations, yet have varied very little. Our fruit-trees and <b>culinary</b> <b>plants,</b> which are so variable, have been cultivated from an ancient period, and, though they probably still receive more nutriment than in their natural state, yet they must have received during many generations nearly the same amount; and it might be thought that they would have become habituated to the excess. Nevertheless, on the whole, Knight's view, that excess of food {{is one of the most}} potent causes of variability, appears, as far as I can judge, probable.|$|R
60|$|There {{can be no}} doubt, {{from the}} facts given in this chapter, that {{extremely}} slight changes in the conditions of life sometimes, probably often, act in a definite manner on our domesticated productions; and, as the action of changed conditions in causing indefinite variability is accumulative, {{so it may be}} with their definite action. Hence considerable and definite modifications of structure probably follow from altered conditions acting during a long series of generations. In some few instances a marked effect has been produced quickly on all, or nearly all, the individuals which have been exposed to a marked change of climate, food, or other circumstance. This has occurred with European men in the United States, with European dogs in India, with horses in the Falkland Islands, apparently with various animals at Angora, with foreign oysters in the Mediterranean, and with maize transported from one climate to another. We have seen that the chemical compounds of some plants and the state of their tissues are readily affected by changed conditions. A relation apparently exists between certain characters and certain conditions, so that if the latter be changed the character is lost--as with the colours of flowers, the state of some <b>culinary</b> <b>plants,</b> the fruit of the melon, the tail of fat-tailed sheep, and the peculiar fleeces of other sheep.|$|R

Some are cultivars of other basil species, and others are hybrids. It is particularly challenging to determine which species a basil belongs to.

However, all these surveys were devoted to Numeral classifiers analyzing {{them in terms of}} physical, functional or social characteristics and/or essence of the entities. Among the different noun categorizations, I intend to show that two kinds of categorization may be found in Burmese, based respectively on conceptual and taxonomic systems. Beside the obvious and complex numeral classifier system (conceptual system) used mainly for quantification, co-occur a noun classifier system (taxonomic one), and traces of an old pre-head classifier system, as suggested by Thurgood (1981). The conceptual system of numeral classifiers in Burmese uses physical criteria as shape, height, consistency, essence (animate vs non-animate, abstraction [...] .) and social criteria (i. e. hierarchy in animacy), functional criterion as for classifying tools or vehicles, but also arrangement or collection criterion for grouping items, and quanta criteria to classify mass nouns. On the other hand, the taxonomic system of noun classifiers divides part of the living organisms in subcategories as the subcategory of trees, flowers, or animals.
