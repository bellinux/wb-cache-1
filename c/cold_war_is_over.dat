He said that the United States should try to maintain a [...] "respectful relationship with Russia" [...] and avoid taking actions that the Russians might view as a provocation, such as seeking to have Ukraine join NATO or otherwise interfering in Russia's relationship with Ukraine. Two weeks later, after the Russian parliament authorized {{the use of military force}} in Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered military exercises along Russia's border with Ukraine, Paul began taking a different tone. He wrote: [...] "Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is a gross violation of that nation's sovereignty and an affront to the international community... Putin must be punished for violating the Budapest Memorandum, and Russia must learn that the U.S. will isolate it if it insists on acting like a rogue nation." [...] He said that the United States and European allies could retaliate against Russia's military aggression without any need for military action. He urged that the United States impose economic sanctions on Russia and resume an effort to build ]. He also called for the United States to take steps as a counterweight to Russia's strategic influence on Europe's oil and gas supply, such as lifting restrictions on new exploration and drilling for fossil fuels in the United States along with immediate approval of the controversial Keystone Pipeline, which he said would allow the United States to ship more oil and gas to Europe if Russia attempts to cut off its own supply to Europe.|$|E

Then, in rapid succession beginning in 1989, the Berlin Wall came down, the Soviet Union collapsed, and the <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> Suddenly, the threat from the East that had dominated American military thinking for decades was gone.

This dissertation examines the contours of second generation peacekeeping operations from a standpoint informed by postcolonial theory and other critical theoretical perspectives. It examines the emergence of widened peacemaking and peace enforcement activities in Somalia and Haiti, and also examines alternative approaches to conflict transformation by examining networked social movement responses. In particular, it explores and expounds the postcolonial view that peacekeeping interventions silence and disempower Southern (or Third World) populations, operating as a form of crisis management. It explores the hypothesis that the duty to protest is another form of colonialism, coinciding with structural destabilisation to produce unequal power...|$|R

40|$|The {{last decade}} of this {{millennium}} is experiencing a revolution in undersea technologies relevant to naval military applications. Ten years ago the single most pressing global consideration of western navies was the tracking and containment of Soviet nuclear-powered submarines in deep water.

The US spent literally {{billions of dollars on}} the SOSUS system to implement this strategy. Now that the <b>cold</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> the emphasis has shifted to higher frequencies, broader bandwidths, intelligent processing and active systems as the focus has moved to littoral regions and submarines have become very much quieter.

The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have tested virtually all aspects of the military's support infrastructure.

In response to the enemy developing new strategies on a near monthly basis, the Joint Training Counter-IED Operations Integration Center (JTCOIC) was first created.

40|$|Following initial enthusiasm in {{the post-war}} period, land reform {{fell out of}} favour with donors from the early 1970 s. Nonetheless, {{sporadic}} efforts to redistribute land continued: Ethiopia in 1975, Zimbabwe in 1980 and a renewed commitment to land reform in the Philippines in 1988. These reforms stemmed from shifts in the domestic {{balance of power between}} landowners and landless workers and peasants, which were quite independent of donor policies. In the 1990 s, decollectivisation and privatisation in the former socialist economies have provided a new dimension to land reform; so too has majority rule in South Africa, where the racially-skewed ownership of land is under challenge and where market-based measures to achieve land redistribution in favour of blacks are being tried. In the Philippines non-market policies are being supported by donors, now that the <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>is</b> <b>over.</b> Whereas the geographical context and individual country strategies may be new, the range of land reform measures being adopted and the implementation problems encountered are not.

50|$|Construction on the Green Line {{began in}} 1987. One {{of the reasons}} for {{construction}} was that the Green Line would serve the aerospace and defense industries in the El Segundo area. Construction of the line cost $718 million. By the time the Green Line opened in 1995, the <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> and the aerospace sector was hemorrhaging jobs. Furthermore, during the 1980s, the bedroom communities in the Gateway Cities region of southeastern Los Angeles County were rapidly losing their population of middle-class aerospace workers (primarily whites and blacks), a process that radically accelerated in the early 1990s. The working-class and poor Hispanics who filled the vacuum generally had no connection to the aerospace sector. This rationale for Green Line construction was a principal argument cited by the Bus Riders Union when it contended that the MTA was focusing its efforts on serving middle-class whites and not working-class minorities. As a result, ridership has been below projected estimates, averaging approximately 44,000 daily weekday boardings in June 2008.|$|R
50|$|Chris Gerlach was {{introduced}} to public service and the military early on as a Civil Air Patrol Cadet at age 13, ultimately earning top leadership awards and rank within the cadet program. This set him on a course to the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul, where he received a B.A. in political science. Before graduation, however, he was fortunate to land an internship with U.S. Senator Rudy Boschwitz. This experience over ten months spent in St. Paul and Washington D.C. furthered his interest in public policy and public service. Chris Gerlach then joined the United States Air Force, and was a lieutenant and intercontinental ballistic missile crew commander at Ellsworth Air Force Base. He later earned his M.B.A. at the University of South Dakota in Vermillion, South Dakota. By the early 1990s, the <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> and the world was changing.

40|$|For fifty years, the United States was {{involved}} in a nuclear arms race of immense proportions.

40|$|This {{paper is}} quite {{different}} from the usual Japan Economic Seminar presentation. Rather than a piece of original research, this paper is a summary of personal views and reflections about the current status of the U. S. -Japan economic relationship. The purpose is to stimulate discussion at our seminar meeting about the relationship, somewhat in continuation of what transpired at the seminar's Washington meeting concerning Marcus Noland's paper. If there is a theme or conclusion to the following pages, it is that economists need to be less purely academic in their approach to bilateral issues. Important problems do exist in the bilateral relationship; they are not all necessarily true economic problems, but neither are they simply "political" issues which economists tend to view with disdain. Dealing with these problems obviously requires tact and diplomacy, but they can be ignored only at the peril of seriously damaging the overall economic and strategic relationship. Especially now that the <b>cold</b> <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>over,</b> and economic aspects of the U. S. -Japan relationship are receiving relatively more attention than in the past, economists have a responsibility to be closely involved in considering the nature of the problems and their possible solutions...|$|E

To this effect, President Bill Clinton would declare in his inaugural address: [...] "Today, as an old order passes, the new world is more free but less stable.
