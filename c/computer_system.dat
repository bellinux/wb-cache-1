5|$|A {{symmetric}} multiprocessor (SMP) is a <b>computer</b> <b>system</b> {{with multiple}} identical processors that share memory and connect via a bus. Bus contention prevents bus architectures from scaling. As a result, SMPs {{generally do not}} comprise more than 32processors. Because of {{the small size of}} the processors and the significant reduction in the requirements for bus bandwidth achieved by large caches, such symmetric multiprocessors are extremely cost-effective, provided that a sufficient amount of memory bandwidth exists.|$|E

5|$|In Herring v.

Ginsburg viewed suppression as a way to prevent the government from profiting from mistakes, and therefore as a remedy to preserve judicial integrity and respect civil rights. She also rejected Roberts' assertion that suppression would not deter mistakes, contending making police pay a high price for mistakes would encourage them to take greater care.|$|E
