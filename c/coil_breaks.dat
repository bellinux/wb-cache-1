They play themselves, {{although}} the scene seems to perpetuate the band's former pretense that they are indeed siblings. Jack shows Meg his Tesla coil that he says he built himself and waxes intellectual on the achievements of Nikola Tesla. In the beginning, Jack seems upset that Meg doesn't share his excitement, and it takes Meg some coaxing to get Jack to agree to show Meg his Tesla Coil. He introduces the line, [...] "Nikola Tesla perceived the earth to be a conductor of acoustical resonance." [...] Cinqué Lee plays a waiter in this segment. In the end, the <b>coil</b> <b>breaks,</b> and Meg and the Waiter offer suggestions as to why it might be broken. Finally Meg says something that Jack seems to agree to, and he leaves to [...] "go home and check it out". Meg clinks her coffee cup to produce a ringing noise, pauses, says [...] "Earth as a conductor of acoustical resonance" [...] and clinks her coffee cup to produce the noise again; she looks pensively out into the distance before a cut to black. Early during the segment, [...] "Down on the Street" [...] by The Stooges is played in the background.|$|E

40|$|Aileron {{actuators}} are pivotal {{components for}} aircraft flight control system. Thus, the fault diagnosis of aileron actuators is vital in {{the enhancement of}} the reliability and fault tolerant capability. This paper presents an aileron actuator fault diagnosis approach combining principal component analysis (PCA), grid search (GS), 10 -fold cross validation (CV), and one-versus-one support vector machine (SVM). This method {{is referred to as}} PGC-SVM and utilizes the direct drive valve input, force motor current, and displacement feedback signal to realize fault detection and location. First, several common faults of aileron actuators, which include force motor <b>coil</b> <b>break,</b> sensor <b>coil</b> <b>break,</b> cylinder leakage, and amplifier gain reduction, are extracted from the fault quadrantal diagram; the corresponding fault mechanisms are analyzed. Second, the data feature extraction is performed with dimension reduction using PCA. Finally, the GS and CV algorithms are employed to train a one-versus-one SVM for fault classification, thus obtaining the optimal model parameters and assuring the generalization of the trained SVM, respectively. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, four types of faults are introduced into the simulation model established by AMESim and Simulink. The results demonstrate its desirable diagnostic performance which outperforms that of the traditional SVM by comparison...|$|R

40|$|The "theta pinch" {{phenomenon}} of plasma physics {{is used to}} break an empty cola can into two pieces and shoot the two parts out of the coil with considerable speed. A large capacitor is charged with about 1800 joules of electrical energy and discharged through a three-turn coil in which the cola can fits snugly, as shown in Figure 1. The rapid discharge of the capacitor creates a current through the coil that rises to over 10, 000 amperes, which in turn creates a rapidly increasing axial magnetic field, which in turn causes an induced electric field that causes a current of over 10, 000 amperes in the can. The magnetic force on the electrons in the can in the magnetic field of the <b>coil</b> <b>break</b> the can and shoot the two parts out of the coil. An animated graphics sequence summarizes the mechanism by which the phenomenon occurs.

40|$|Forces {{acting on}} the S 4 {{segments}} of the channel, the voltage-sensing structures, are analyzed. The conformational change in the Na channel is modeled as a helix-coil transition in the four S 4 segments, coupled to the membrane voltage by electrical forces. In the model, repulsions between like charges make the S 4 segment unstable, but field-dependent forces hold it in an alpha-helix configuration at resting potential. At threshold depolarization, the S 4 helices cooperatively expand into random <b>coils,</b> <b>breaking</b> the hydrogen bonds connecting adjacent loops of the alpha helices. Exposed electron pairs left on the carbonyl oxygens constitute sites at which cations can bind selectively. The first hydrogen bond to break is at the channel exterior, then the second breaks, and so on in a zipper-like motion along the entire segment. The Na+ ions hop from one site to the next until all H bonds are broken and all sites are filled with ions. This completes the pathway over which the permeant ions move through the channel, driven by the electrochemical potential difference across the membrane. This microscopic mechanism {{is consistent with the}} thermodynamic explanation of ion-channel gating previously formulated as the ferroelectric-superionic transition hypothesis...|$|R

5000|$|Although modern {{induction}} coils {{used for}} educational purposes all use the vibrating arm 'hammer' type interrupter described above, these were inadequate for powering the large induction coils used in spark-gap radio transmitters and x-ray machines {{around the turn}} of the 20th century. In powerful coils the high primary current created arcs at the interrupter contacts which quickly destroyed the contacts. [...] Also, since each [...] "break" [...] produces a pulse of voltage from the <b>coil,</b> the more <b>breaks</b> per second the greater the power output.

50|$|Soon {{after the}} {{introduction}} of electric power into coal mines, {{it was discovered that}} lethal explosions could be initiated by electrical equipment such as lighting, signals, or motors. The hazard of fire damp or methane accumulation in mines was well known by the time electricity was introduced, along with the danger of suspended coal dust. At least two British mine explosions were attributed to an electric bell signal system. In this system, two bare wires were run along the length of a drift, and any miner desiring to signal the surface would momentarily touch the wires to each other or bridge the wires with a metal tool. The inductance of the signal bell <b>coils,</b> combined with <b>breaking</b> of contacts by exposed metal surfaces, resulted in sparks which could ignite methane, causing an explosion.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{very rare}} that a coil would just stop working in an {{electromagnetic}} coupling [...] Typically, if a coil fails it is usually due to heat which has caused the insulation of the <b>coil</b> wire to <b>break</b> down. The heat {{can be caused by}} high ambient temperature, high cycle rates, slipping or applying too high of a voltage. Bushings can be used in some clutches that have low speed, low side loads or low operating hours. At higher loads and speeds, bearing mounted field/rotors and hubs are a better option. Most brakes are flanged mounted and have bearings but some brakes are bearing mounted. Like the coils, unless bearings are stressed beyond their physical limitations or become contaminated, they tend to have a long life and they are usually the second item to wear out.|$|R
5000|$|In {{electronics}} {{before the}} development of switch-mode power supplies {{and the introduction of}} semiconductor devices operating off low voltage, there was a requirement to generate voltages of about 50 to 250V DC from vehicle batteries. Electromechanical components known as vibrators were used in a circuit similar to modern solid state inverter circuits to provide a pulsating DC which could be converted to a higher voltage with a transformer, rectified, and filtered to create higher-voltage DC. This [...] "vibrator" [...] is essentially a relay using normally closed contacts to supply power to the relay <b>coil,</b> thus immediately <b>breaking</b> the connection, only to be reconnected very quickly through the normally closed contacts. It happens so rapidly it vibrates, and sounds like a buzzer. This same rapidly pulsing contact applies the rising and falling DC voltage to the transformer which can step it up to a higher voltage.|$|R
5000|$|To {{prevent the}} high {{voltages}} {{generated in the}} <b>coil</b> from <b>breaking</b> down the thin insulation and arcing between the secondary wires, the secondary coil uses special construction {{so as to avoid}} having wires carrying large voltage differences lying next to each other. In one widely used technique, the secondary coil is wound in many thin flat pancake-shaped sections (called [...] "pies"), connected in series. [...] The primary coil is first wound on the iron core and insulated from the secondary with a thick paper or rubber coating. [...] Then each secondary subcoil is connected to the coil next to it and slid onto the iron core, insulated from adjoining coils with waxed cardboard disks. The voltage developed in each subcoil isn't large enough to jump between the wires in the subcoil. [...] Large voltages are only developed across many subcoils in series, which are too widely separated to arc over. To give the entire coil a final insulating coating, it is immersed in melted paraffin wax or rosin; the air evacuated to ensure there are no air bubbles left inside and the paraffin allowed to solidify, so the entire coil is encased in wax. To prevent eddy currents, which cause energy losses, the iron core is made of a bundle of parallel iron wires, individually coated with shellac to insulate them electrically. [...] The eddy currents, which flow in loops in the core perpendicular to the magnetic axis, are blocked by the layers of insulation. The ends of the insulated primary coil often protruded several inches from either end of the secondary coil, to prevent arcs from the secondary to the primary or the core.|$|R
40|$|The super-conducting magnet {{system of}} Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X) {{consists}} of five identical field periods (modules). Magnetic field errors arise if the modules {{are not exactly}} identical. Even small deviations in the coil shapes of the same type or misalignments of <b>coils</b> or modules <b>break</b> the periodicity {{of the system and}} cause error field components. Simulation of the magnetic field perturbations which are expected has been done by the analysis of existing winding packages and statistical extrapolations of inaccuracies expected during assembly steps. Numerical experiment has shown that assembly errors should contribute significantly more than manufacturing errors of individual coils. Compensation of the magnetic field perturbation can be done with help of the coil adjustment during the assembly or by the individual adjustment of all five modules. Further compensation of field errors is possible with additional coils. The existing control coils in W 7 -X can be used for error field compensation, however their efficacy is limited. Therefore, solutions employing normal-conducting trim coils outside the cryostat vessel are also considered here. 1...|$|R

Ultrastructural effects related to antibiosis were studied by dual culture of B. subtilis (MBI 600) and R. solani on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates. Hyphal growth near the inhibition zone was processed. To {{study the effects of}} hyperparasitism on fungal ultrastructure, Integral was sprayed on R. solani mycelia and observations were made three days later. Interactions of B. subtilis (MBI 600) and R. solani in planta were determined by spraying detached rice leaves with B. subtilis (MBI 600) and then inoculating with sclerotia of R. solani. In addition, sclerotia were dipped in Integral for 24 h, and cut sections were then observed. Overall the results indicate that B. subtilis (MBI 600) caused loss of structural integrity, shriveling, abnormal coiling, and lysis of the R. solani hyphae due to antibiosis and hyperparasitism in dual culture assays. On rice leaves, B. subtilis (MBI 600) also caused abnormal <b>coiling,</b> shriveling, and <b>break</b> down of hyphae. Sclerotia of R. solani dipped in Integral resulted in colonization of B. subtilis(MBI 600), maceration, and fragmentation of inner walls.

40|$|Existing shock sensors for car {{protection}} {{using the}} sensitive elements (SE) of piezoelectric, microphone and electromagnetic types and the analogue circuitry of signal processing, {{have a number}} of essential shortcomings: - piezoelectric sensitive elements have no characteristics repeatability that complicates their use in mass production; - microphone sensors are structurally complicated and demand difficult information signal processing; - sensitive elements of electromagnetic sensors demand individual control (a specified clearance to be set between a magnet and the coil). Use of analogue elements (resistors, capacitors) in the amplifier and filter circuits reduces temporary and temperature stability of characteristics. An adjustment of the sensor operating zones via variable resistors on a printed circuit is extremely inconvenient and doesn't allow to change quickly the sensor sensitivity depending on an external situation (for example, to increase quickly an operating zone of the sensor with an alarm system of a key fob when securing a car in the country or in the woods, or to reduce it in the street with heavy traffic streams). An analogue circuit–based sensor design disables its automatic adaptation to such external impacts as a rain, a stream passing by cars, etc. The article considers how to solve some of above problems while designing the two-zone digital shock sensors with a SE of electromagnetic type. It shows the SE design developed by the authors as a module containing the coil and a magnet, secured on the coil axis in a silicone extension. The circuitry solution and algorithms of signals processing allowed authors to realize a remote control of the prevention and alarm zones (with 16 gradation of sensitivity). The algorithm of self-adaptation to the repeating external impacts is proposed. The developed method to form the basic levels of digital comparators for each gradation of sensitivity enables the sensor to have the straight-line adjusting characteristic. The developed shock sensor is implemented as stock-produced items included in the car alarm systems of the trademark “Excellent” (made by JSC Magic Ring Ltd.). Operating experience (about 40 thousand pieces realized now) allows a proper adjustment of sensors to be possible on cars with any body type. A sufficient level of the sensor sensitivity proves it. The reliability of sensors is confirmed by failures statistics in use (0, 08 %). Failures are, usually, caused by the SE <b>coil</b> wire <b>break</b> in a soldering point of the coil leads to the printed circuit. However a number of shortcomings are also revealed. Experimental data processing of a test batch of sensors has shown that existing SE of electromagnetic type have the frequency of free vibrations f  80  5 Hz and a decay constant of transient under shock   0, 2 s. At these parameters a SE pass-band makes only f  1, 5 Hz, and the sensor responses only to the shock front, rather than to the secondary vibrations of a body. It is an essential drawback of the narrow-band sensors. The experiments conducted on test batch of sensors (10 samples) have shown essentially different sensitivities of sensors under shock {{in the direction of the}} sensitivity axis and perpendicular to it. This difference reaches 4 - 6 gradations of sensitivity. It means that when mounting a sensor on the particular car the orientation of sensitivity axis of the sensor will be of crucial importance that is also a shortcoming. It is shown that overcoming the specified drawbacks is hardly because of the improvement of sensitive elements suspension of electromagnetic sensors. Three-axial accelerometers implemented using MEMS technologies seem to be the most perspective application here. </p...|$|R
