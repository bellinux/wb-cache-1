50|$|Peter Schiff is {{the author}} of six books {{published}} by John Wiley & Sons. His book, <b>Crash</b> <b>Proof</b> 2.0, appeared on both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal bestseller lists.|$|E
50|$|The book, {{published}} in 2007, {{just before the}} 2008 financial crisis predicted an imminent decline {{in the value of}} the American dollar and advised investment in foreign securities and precious metals. After the recession of 2008, he published an updated version of the book called <b>Crash</b> <b>Proof</b> 2.0 which in January 2010 was listed on the New York Times best-seller list.|$|E

Windy-Knoll-View Pronto and Picston Shottle are two of the grandsons of Prelude.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{elementary}} proof for {{the result of}} Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson (FLP) [J. ACM 32 (2) (April 1985) 374 – 382] that the consensus problem cannot be solved deterministically in an asynchronous system where a single process may fail by <b>crashing.</b> Our <b>proof</b> is, {{in contrast to the}} original, constructive in its crucial lemma, showing not only that a nonterminating execution does exist but also how it can be constructed. Our proof is based on the new notion of non-uniformity of a configuration. Non-uniformity is different from bivalency, which is the central notion in the original proof as well as in proofs of related results. © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{formal proof}} obligations for data refinement {{in the presence}} of unexpected crashes, notably due to a power failure. The work is part of our effort to construct a verified file system for flash memory. We apply the theory to one of the components in the flash file system, namely the erase block management layer. We show its functional correctness with respect to a high-level specification. We prove that the system can always recover from power loss to a desired state. We observe two simplifications that greatly reduce the <b>proof</b> effort for <b>crashes</b> in practice. <b>Proofs</b> are mechanized in the theorem prover KIV...|$|R
50|$|In his 2007 book <b>Crash</b> <b>Proof,</b> Schiff {{wrote that}} US {{economic}} policies were fundamentally unsound. Since then, he has stated {{many times that}} without a change in US government economic policy, there will be hyperinflation and that the imbalance {{between the amount of}} goods the US consumed and what it produced would eventually lead to problems for the US economy. As a remedy, he favored increased personal savings and production to stimulate economic growth. Schiff cited the US's low personal savings rate as one of the causes of its transformation from the world's largest creditor nation in the 1970s to the largest debtor nation in 2000. He attributed the low savings rate to what he asserts are high inflation and artificially low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a work zone alert system informing speeding drivers of the upcoming work zone and raising their attention level before they reach the taper line and/or the work zone flag operator. The resulting system, termed Intelligent Drum Line (IDL), is capable of delivering visual and auditory warnings, targeting vehicles that are exceeding the posted or temporary speed limit upstream of the work zone. The IDL system, in its final incarnation, is the best compromise that can be reached between developing a low-cost system that is rugged enough to be deployed on the shoulder of high-speed roadways and comprised of as few individual parts as possible so a single work zone worker can deploy and move the system as the work zone operations are progressing and delivery of a warning targeted only at vehicles that are going faster than the desired speed set by the work zone crew. The IDL system has been tested in the MnROAD facility, targeting vehicles ranging from regular passenger vehicles to a 3 -ton snowplow truck. The auditory warning has been successful in penetrating the vehicle cab and loud enough to attract the attention of the driver. Although, still in a prototype stage, the IDL system has received high marks from MnDOT engineers and work zone workers. Further development is needed to ensure that the final product is <b>crash</b> <b>proof</b> and that it can be produced efficiently. Minnesota Department of Transportation Research Service...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{have a new}} {{proof of}} the lower bound that k-set {{agreement}} requires ⌊f/k ⌋ + 1 rounds in a synchronous, message-passing model with f <b>crash</b> failures. The <b>proof</b> involves constructing the set of reachable states, proving that these states are highly connected, and then appealing to a well-known topological result that high connectivity implies that set agreement is impossible. We construct the set of reachable states in an iterative fashion using a round operator that we define, and our proof of connectivity is an inductive proof based on this iterative construction and using simple properties of the round operator. This is the shortest and simplest proof of this lower bound we have seen. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{issue of}} performativity {{concerns}} {{the claim that}} economics shape rather than merely describe the social world. This idea took hold following a paper by Donald MacKenzie and Yuval Millo entitled “Constructing a Market, Performing Theory: The Historical Sociology of a Financial Derivatives Exchange” (2003). That paper constitutes {{an important contribution to}} the history of economic thought, since it provides an original way to focus on the scientific construction of the real economy. The authors discuss the empirical success of the Black– Scholes–Merton (BSM) model on the Chicago Board Options Exchange during the period from 1973 to 1987. They explain this success in part as instead of discovering pre-existing price regularities, the model was used by traders to anticipate option prices in their arbitrages. As a result, option prices came to correspond to the theoretical prices derived from the BSM model. In the present article I show {{that this is not a}} completely correct conclusion, since the BSM model never became a self-fulfilling model. I would claim that the October 1987 stock market <b>crash</b> is empirical <b>proof</b> that the financial world never fit with the economic theory underpinning the BSM...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{of being}} quite similar {{agreement}} problems, consensus and general k-set agreement require surprisingly different techniques for proving the impossibility in asynchronous systems with crash failures: Rather than relatively simple bivalence arguments {{as in the}} impossibility proof for consensus (= 1 -set agreement) {{in the presence of}} a single <b>crash</b> failure, known <b>proofs</b> for the impossibility of k-set agreement in systems with at least k> 1 crash failures use algebraic topology or a variant of Sperner's Lemma. In this paper, we present a generic theorem for proving the impossibility of k-set agreement in various message passing settings, which is based on a simple reduction to the consensus impossibility in a certain subsystem. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our result by exploring the possibility/impossibility border of k-set agreement in several message-passing system models: (i) asynchronous systems with crash failures, (ii) partially synchronous processes with (initial) crash failures, and (iii) asynchronous systems augmented with failure detectors. In (i) and (ii), the impossibility part is just an instantiation of our main theorem, whereas the possibility of achieving k-set agreement in (ii) follows by generalizing the consensus algorithm for initial crashes by Fisher, Lynch and Patterson. In (iii), applying our technique yields the exact border for the parameter k where k-set agreement is solvable with the failure detector class (Sigma_k,Omega_k), for (1 <= k<= n- 1), of Bonnet and Raynal. Considering that Sigma_k was shown to be necessary for solving k-set agreement, this result yields new insights on the quest for the weakest failure detector. Comment: 15 page...|$|R
