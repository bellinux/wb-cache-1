5000|$|Although many of {{the early}} {{settlers}} were religious, including the <b>Clevengers</b> who were Mormons, through April 1939 various attempts by churches {{to set up a}} Sunday School in Laveen had failed. However, that month members of the Central Baptist Church of Phoenix leased space in the Laveen School Auditorium, and their [...] "mission" [...] took hold and by 1943 grew into the Laveen Baptist Church. That year the church purchased land for a permanent building on the northeast corner of 51st Avenue and Dobbins Road, across from the school. The church added a parsonage in 1948 and by the 1970s had a full-time pastor. Today Laveen supports seven churches and has an Islamic mosque under construction.|$|R

25|$|Terry Pendleton {{started his}} {{baseball}} {{career as an}} Eastside Little League player, {{then moved on to}} play second baseman at Channel Islands High School, then moved to Oxnard College from 1979/80. Terry played on the very first Oxnard college baseball team in 1979 and helped lead the Condors to a state championship berth then earning a scholarship and going on to a collegiate baseball career at Fresno State. He played the 1981 and 1982 seasons with the Bulldogs, and was a key contributor to the team's fourth consecutive conference title in the 1982 season when he set a school record with 98 hits. That feat led to his recognition as an All-American. As a result, Pendleton had his jersey retired in 2007, alongside the jerseys of Tex <b>Clevenger</b> and Jimy Williams. He was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the seventh round of the 1982 amateur draft, and subsequently signed with the team on June 12, 1982.|$|E

Different extracts of the aerial parts of Launaea nudicaulis were tested for their activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.

5000|$|<b>Clevenger's</b> debut novel, The Contortionist's Handbook, {{was first}} {{published}} in 2002. It is the story of John Dolan Vincent, a prodigious forger who has been detained for a psychiatric interview following a near-fatal painkiller overdose. As the narrator bluffs his way through the interview in order to avoid being involuntarily institutionalized, he tells the reader his true story - the one he is not telling the psychiatrist - revealing both his past and the true nature of his circumstances. The Contortionist's Handbook has since been translated into five languages - German, Italian, Polish, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese - as well as published in the United Kingdom by HarperCollins. Several other translations are forthcoming, including Russian and Japanese. Film rights for The Contortionist's Handbook were optioned in 2007 by Greenestreet Films.

The methanolic extracts of Clove, Acorus, Nutmeg, Orange peel were prepared by ultrasonic bath extraction method and labeled as DSC, DSA, DSN and DSO respectively for further studies. Preliminary pytochemical screening of extracts were also performed. Asarones were detected in Acorus extract by subjecting the TLC to UV light and observing blue fluorescence.

His first start was on July 3, 2013, against the Chicago White Sox, a game the Orioles won 4–2 although Feldman {{did not get the}} decision. Feldman had his best start as an Oriole August 18, and was borderline dominant the entire outing. Through his first six innings, Feldman had allowed just two hits, while not allowing a single run to score. The Orioles took the victory 7–2 against the Rockies. He improved upon that outing by tossing the first complete game shutout of his career on September 6, holding the White Sox to 5 hits.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{started the}} season slowly, but then began hitting, getting one homer {{in each of}} three games of a four-game span in mid-April.

On June 18, Davis hit his first career grand slam against Jake Arrieta of the Orioles. The grand slam also extended his hitting streak to 9 games, and Davis hit [...]462 (12-for-26) during the span. After the hot streak Davis cooled and again struggled. Davis was ejected from a Major League game {{for the first time}} in his career on June 26, when he argued with umpire Manny Gonzalez after Steve <b>Clevenger</b> was ruled safe at first on a pickoff attempt.

2500|$|Using {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} to monitor the crossings over the last 25 years, scientists report that 10 species of large mammals (including deer, elk, black bear, grizzly bear, mountain lion, wolf, moose, and coyote) have used the 24 crossings in Banff a total of 84,000 times as of January 2007 [...] The research also identified a [...] "learning curve" [...] such that animals need time to acclimate to the structures before they feel comfortable using them. For example, grizzly bear crossings increased from seven in 1996 to more than 100 in 2006, although the actual number of individual bears using the structures remained constant over this time at between 2 and 4 bears (Parks Canada, unpublished results). A similar set of observations was made for wolves, with crossings increasing from two to approximately 140 over the same 10-year period. However, in this case the actual number of wolves in the packs using the crossings increased dramatically, from a low of two up to a high of over 20 individuals. In continuation with these positive results, [...] reported that the use of wildlife crossings and fencing reduced traffic-induced mortality of large ungulates on the TCH by more than 80 percent. Recent analysis for carnivores showed results were not as positive however, with bear mortality increasing by an average of 116 percent in direct parallel to an equal doubling of traffic volumes on the highway, clearly showing no effect of fencing to reduce bear mortality (Hallstrom, <b>Clevenger,</b> Maher and Whittington, in prep). Research on the crossings in Banff has thus shown mixed value of wildlife crossings depending on the species in question.|$|E
