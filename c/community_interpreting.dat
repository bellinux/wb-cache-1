50|$|Also {{known as}} <b>community</b> <b>{{interpreting}},</b> {{is the type}} of interpreting occurring in fields such as legal, health, and local government, social, housing, environmental health, education, and welfare services. In <b>community</b> <b>interpreting,</b> factors exist which determine and affect language and communication production, such as speech's emotional content, hostile or polarized social surroundings, its created stress, the power relationships among participants, and the interpreter's degree of responsibility — in many cases more than extreme; in some cases, even the life of the other person depends upon the interpreter's work.|$|E

But recognizing the diverse levels of attainment that living beings have achieved, rather than presenting these five principles as a single set of guidelines, they are divided into two. As mahāvratas, or “great vows” that are taken by male and female Jain ascetics, these five moral principles are interpreted as strictly as humanly possible. Indeed, male ascetics of the Digambara <b>community</b> <b>interpret</b> the fifth principle, aparigraha, as precluding even the possession of clothing.

We could, of course, limit the goal of our scholarship and teaching to merely re-cording or cataloguing the variant interpretations. However, I suggest that our work as scholars and in-structors is not complete if we stop there – we need to go beyond this to show that interpretations are strategic and to enquire what social agendas specific interpretive strategies may advance. In addition, I show that certain modes of interpretation are questionable either insofar as they are misleading in some way, or insofar as they reinforce the unquestioned authority of the text under consideration. If we sensitize ourselves and our students to the possible social effects of different strategies of interpretation, we will be able more easily to make visible those negotiations of social power that typically operate invisibly...|$|R

40|$|This PhD aims at {{establishing}} {{the foundations for}} professionalism in <b>community</b> <b>interpreting.</b> It also aims to define the specific qualities an interpreter should acquire {{in order to be}} considered a professional. The literature review on professionalism took us from sociology to <b>community</b> <b>interpreting,</b> and the conclusions drafted from that review show that training is an essential ingredient for anyone who wants to be considered a professional. The review also led to the conclusion that professionalism in <b>community</b> <b>interpreting</b> is built upon four pillars: a) technical competence; b) knowledge of the specialised area within which <b>community</b> <b>interpreting</b> takes place; c) knowledge of role boundaries; and d) knowledge and adherence to the professional code of ethics. In order to demonstrate such conclusions empirically I used Australia as the setting from which to draw participants, as in Australia there are different ways to achieve the professional status as a community interpreter. One of those ways is by passing an accreditation examination, which is short in duration and limited in content. The other is based on successfully completing a university/TAFE course approved by the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters (NAATI). The empirical tests used in this research project aim to highlight the differences between those who obtained their accreditation or professional status by these two different paths. The tests used for this research consist of a mock dialogue the candidates had to interpret (to test their technical competence) and a survey which was distributed through AUSIT, the Australian Institute for Interpreters and translators (to analyse their knowledge on the code of ethics, role and background knowledge) ...|$|E
