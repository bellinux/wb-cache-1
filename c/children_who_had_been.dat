Kooman wrote She Has a Name with the intention of bringing attention to this issue, specifically in connection with sexual exploitation.|$|E

The only people known to have survived the final attack were the Talon <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> adopted by the Karankawa. According to the children, the settlement had been attacked around Christmas of 1688, and all the remaining settlers had been killed.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{high-profile}} Senate committee inquiries was the Senate Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident, which in 2002 investigated {{what became known as}} the Children Overboard Affair. The events and subsequent Senate committee inquiries were widely reported, and the transcripts of the inquiry formed the basis of a play, A Certain Maritime Incident. Other high-profile inquiries included the Community Affairs committee's inquiry into Children in Institutional Care, which brought to wide public notice the experiences of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> placed in care in sometimes inhumane circumstances and was directly responsible for state governments and churches making public apologies to the victims of abuse or neglect; the Select Committee on Mental Health, which contributed to widespread discussion of mental health issues and to a major funding boost for services in 2006; and the 2006 inquiry into the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, which contributed to a government decision not to proceed with controversial migration legislation.|$|E

5|$|She Has a Name is a {{play about}} human {{trafficking}} written by Andrew Kooman in 2009 as a single act and expanded to full length in 2010. It is about the trafficking of children into sexual slavery and {{was inspired by the}} deaths of 54 people in the Ranong human-trafficking incident. Kooman had previously published literature, but this was his first full-length play. The stage premiere of She Has a Name was directed by Stephen Waldschmidt in Calgary, Alberta in February 2011. From May to October 2012, She Has a Name toured across Canada. In conjunction with the tour, A Better World raised money to help women and <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> trafficked in Thailand as part of the country's prostitution industry. The first performances of She Has a Name in the United States took place in Folsom, California in 2014 under the direction of Emma Eldridge, who was a 23-year-old college student at the time.|$|E
5|$|After his {{accession}} in Great Britain, George's {{relationship with}} his son (which had always been poor) worsened. George Augustus, Prince of Wales, encouraged opposition to his father's policies, including measures designed to increase religious freedom in Britain and expand Hanover's German territories {{at the expense of}} Sweden. In 1717 the birth of a grandson led to a major quarrel between George and the Prince of Wales. The King, supposedly following custom, appointed the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke of Newcastle, as one of the baptismal sponsors of the child. The King was angered when the Prince of Wales, disliking Newcastle, verbally insulted the Duke at the christening, which the Duke misunderstood as a challenge to a duel. The Prince was told to leave the royal residence, St. James's Palace. The Prince's new home, Leicester House, became a meeting place for the King's political opponents. George and his son were later reconciled at the insistence of Robert Walpole and the desire of the Princess of Wales, who had moved out with her husband but missed her <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> left in the care of the King. However, following the quarrel at the baptism, father and son would never again be on cordial terms.|$|E

Escaping from the POW camp with two comrades, they successfully made it almost to Kuala Lumpur, {{often with the}} aid of Malayan Chinese and Chinese communist guerrillas, before they were betrayed to the Japanese by Malays. It was during this escape that McLaren began to hate the Japanese as he passed the bodies of hundreds of Chinese men, women and <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> tortured, raped, and then killed by Japanese occupation forces.|$|E

In January 1850, he was removed from Vidin, {{where he had been}} kept under house arrest, to Shumen, and thence to Kütahya in Asia Minor. There, he was joined by his <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> confined at Pressburg (present-day Bratislava); his wife (a price had been set on her head) had joined him earlier, having escaped in disguise.|$|E
25|$|Victoria Day {{celebrations}} were {{marred by}} tragedy twice: In 1881, the passenger ferry Victoria overturned in the Thames River, near London, Ontario.

The event {{came to be known as}} the Victoria Day disaster.

25|$|After the 1910 general {{election}} the Liberal Party {{did not have}} a majority in the House of Commons and so entered into a coalition with 42 Labour Party MPs who had been elected. This led to further reforms as the Liberals required Labour support and Irish support to remain in office. In 1912, school clinics were set up to treat <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> diagnosed as having an illness during a School Medical under the 1907 scheme. This measure ensured that more children had access to free medical care. From 1912, Exchequer grants were paid to education authorities providing medical treatment for children, and by 1914, 214 out of the (then) 317 local authorities were providing some kind of medical treatment for children.|$|E
25|$|The Comanche chiefs brought {{only one}} white captive to the meeting, {{as well as}} several Mexican <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{captured}} separately. Muguara refused to deliver more captives {{on the grounds that they}} were held in the rancherías of other chiefs over which he had no authority. The white captive was Matilda Lockhart, a 16-year-old girl who had been held prisoner for over a year and a half. Mary Maverick, who helped care for the girl, wrote almost sixty years after the event that Lockhart had been beaten, raped and had suffered burns to her body. Allegedly, her face was severely disfigured, with her nose entirely burned away, a detail which has been commonly included in Texas history descriptions of the incident since the 1890s.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} several episodes in which {{large numbers of people}} were {{severely}} poisoned by food contaminated with high levels of methylmercury, notably the dumping of industrial waste that resulted in the pollution and subsequent mass poisoning in Minamata and Niigata, Japan and the situation in Iraq in the 1960s and 1970s in which wheat treated with methylmercury as a preservative and intended as seed grain was fed to animals and directly consumed by people (see Basra poison grain disaster). These episodes resulted in neurological symptoms including paresthesias, loss of physical coordination, difficulty in speech, narrowing of the visual field, hearing impairment, blindness, and death. <b>Children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> exposed in-utero through their mothers' ingestion were also affected with a range of symptoms including motor difficulties, sensory problems and intellectual disability.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> abused in {{any form}} develop some sort of {{psychological}} problem.

In the U.S. in 2013, of the 294,000 reported child abuse cases only 81,124 received any sort of counseling or therapy. Treatment is greatly important for abused children.|$|R
