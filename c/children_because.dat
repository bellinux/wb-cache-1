5|$|Quarter Ponies {{are often}} used in western riding {{activities}} as mounts for <b>children</b> <b>because</b> of their small size, and calm, even temperament. Larger ponies {{are more suitable for}} adult riders and sometimes used for rodeo events such as steer wrestling.|$|E
5|$|The couch gag was {{suggested}} by Dan Castellaneta's niece. The film True Lies was {{the inspiration for}} the bus crashing against the bridge. To get the fisherman's Chinese correct, Cohen called his friend. When the Chinese actors came, the actors felt Cantonese would be more appropriate for the fisherman than Mandarin, so it was changed. Moe was picked to rescue the <b>children,</b> <b>because</b> the writers thought it was funny.|$|E
5|$|Bayona {{cut parts}} of the script, {{including}} {{the outcome of the}} other orphanage <b>children,</b> <b>because</b> he wanted to focus on the character of Laura and what happens to her. To create the film as he wanted, Bayona had to double both the film's budget and the amount of filming time. To accomplish this, Bayona received help from fellow film director Guillermo del Toro, whom he had met at Festival de Cine de Sitges when del Toro was presenting his film Cronos (1993). Del Toro offered to co-produce the film as soon as he learned about it. For the rest of his crew, Bayona worked with his regular team that he worked with on commercials and music videos.|$|E

5000|$|Kang Chol-hwan (in Yodok 1977-1987) {{was imprisoned}} as a 9-year-old <b>child</b> <b>because</b> his family {{returned}} from Japan {{and was considered}} politically unreliable.|$|R
5|$|His parents imbue {{him with}} a strong moral compass during his {{formative}} years and warn him never to use his great strength in anger. However, during kindergarten, Danner nearly kills the school's bully in a one-sided fight after being assaulted by the child. This event brands him as an outsider {{in the eyes of}} the other <b>children.</b> <b>Because</b> they treat him with such abhorrence, his only solace comes in the form of unleashing his powers within the Colorado wilderness (uprooting trees, throwing huge boulders, leaping to the mountain tops, etc.). This stigma eventually wears off, though, and is forgotten by the time Danner enters high school.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Bagramyan {{was born}} to Armenian parents {{in the village of}} Chardakhlu, near Yelizavetpol (modern Ganja, Azerbaijan), then a part of the Russian Empire. Chardakhlu was one of the largest Armenian {{settlements}} in the South Caucasus populated almost entirely by migrants from the village of Maghavuz in Nagorno Karabakh who continued keeping a connection with their ancestral land. Hamazasp Babadzhanian, a fellow Armenian who was to become the chief marshal of the Soviet Armor corps, was born in the same village. While Bagramyan's father, Khachatur, went to work all day at the railway station in Yelizavetpol, his mother, Mariam, stayed at home {{to take care of her}} seven <b>children.</b> <b>Because</b> his parents could not afford to send him to the local gymnasium, they decided to enroll him at a recently opened two-year school in Yelizavetpol.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It {{is not uncommon for}} the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as <b>children.</b> <b>Because</b> Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are now more likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.|$|E
50|$|Gold Mustache Man or Nicolaes, a {{rich man}} that seems kind, is Cornelia’s real father. He {{abandons}} his <b>child</b> <b>because</b> she is of a lower class than he is. Cornelia refers {{to him as the}} “Gold Mustache Man” as a <b>child</b> <b>because</b> of his golden, blonde hair and mustache. He figures it was better to leave Hendrickje rather than stay and help her, he justifies himself by asking Cornelia “what he would been to her without his money”.|$|R

5|$|Marie St. Clare – Wife of Augustine, {{she is a}} self-absorbed woman {{without a}} hint of {{compassion}} for those around her, including her own family. Given to an unending list of (apparently imaginary) physical maladies, she continually complains about the lack of sympathy she is receiving. She has separated her personal maid, Mammy, from her own two <b>children</b> <b>because</b> they would interfere with her duties. As Marie drives Mammy to exhaustion, she criticizes her for selfishly seeking to attend her own family. Upon the unexpected death of Augustine, Marie countermands the legal process that would have given Tom his freedom.|$|E
5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the <b>children.</b> <b>Because</b> of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did not}} believe she would have killed her father or <b>children,</b> <b>because</b> her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E

50|$|The word careca is Portuguese for 'bald'. It was a {{nickname}} given to Careca as a <b>child</b> <b>because</b> of {{his admiration for}} a famous Brazilian clown of the same name.|$|R
5|$|Partial solar eclipses are {{hazardous}} to view because the eye's pupil is not {{adapted to the}} unusually high visual contrast: the pupil dilates according to {{the total amount of}} light in the field of view, not by the brightest object in the field. During partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the Moon passing in front of the Sun, but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same surface brightness as during a normal day. In the overall gloom, the pupil expands from ~2mm to ~6mm, and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives up to ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed Sun. This can damage or kill those cells, resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer. The hazard is insidious for inexperienced observers and for <b>children,</b> <b>because</b> there is no perception of pain: it is not immediately obvious that one's vision is being destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The attacks simmered {{down after}} mid-February {{due to the}} arrest and {{imposition}} of a gag order on Raj. Isolated cases of attacks, however, were reported until April 2008. On 22 March, six North Indians were beaten up {{by a group of}} Holi revellers, suspected to be MNS workers, in Santa Cruz, Mumbai. On the same day, a shop owned by a North Indian was ransacked by a group of 10–15drunken men, who pelted stones and beat his <b>children</b> <b>because</b> they had refused to provide free food. On 29 March, motorcycle-borne assailants damaged at least five taxis owned by North Indians in Central Mumbai. Four people were arrested. Four labourers travelling on the Konkan Kanya Express from Thane to Margao in search of jobs were beaten and looted by some men in Raigad district after being identified as North Indians on 1 April. Then on 30 May, a group of North Indians was injured when a mob of approximately 800MNS activists attacked them at a meeting organised by the SP and some other North Indians fronts. Five North Indians were critically injured in the attack, and the police arrested 35MNS activists after the incident.|$|E
5|$|Child labour in the industries, {{especially}} in match making factories, {{was at its}} peak during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1981, the child work force in the age group 4–16 was 30% of the total work force, 90% of whom were girls. In 1986, the National Child Labour project estimated child labour in Sivaksi match making industries to be 14,121 children. The estimates indicated 80% of the child labour belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), who were margianlised for centuries for cheap labour. Poverty and lack of farm produce were stated as {{the main reason for}} child labour. The employers also preferred <b>children</b> <b>because</b> of ease in management, discipline and lack of labour unions. The children in these industries suffered from back ache, neck ache, tuberclosis, malnutrition, gastointestinal disorders, dermatitis, respiratory disorders, over-exhaustion, burn injuries and water borne diseases due to exposure to harmful chemicals in the work environment. The situation of the child labour came to light during an accident of a bus transporting the children in 1976. The central government appointed a one-man committee under Harbans Singh in 1978, who reported abolishing child labour would seriously impact the economy of the region. The National Policy on child labour was formulated by the central government in August 1987, aiming at the rehabilitation of children withdrawn from these factories. In 1988, the union labour ministry initiated a programme for providing informal education, free health care and free lunch for children working in the factories. The Supreme Court of India, in a judgement ruled on December 1996 indicating provisions for preventing child labour like compensation for the child employed, employment to the adult members of the family and contribution to the corpus fund by the state government. From the establishment of child labour Act in 1986 till 2011, 150,000 inspections on child labour have been conducted in the factories, 1,500 cases have been registered and few prosecutions have been made. The results indicated small amount of child labour in cottage and house hold industries.|$|E

50|$|The {{findings}} may have political implications, since {{the demand for}} parents to reduce the time they spend with their <b>child</b> <b>because</b> of work commitments leads to an increased emphasis on institutional child care.|$|R
5000|$|The {{character}} of Hallie {{has been said}} to [...] "embody the Jungian archetype" [...] of the <b>Child,</b> <b>because</b> of the pronounced mode of interaction between Hallie and the other characters in the series.|$|R
25|$|AOL/NeighborhoodScout named West Windsor in 2009 as {{the best}} {{neighborhood}} to raise <b>children</b> <b>because</b> of its school district (top 7% in New Jersey, top 3% nationwide), prevailing family type (families with school-aged children), and neighborhood safety (safer than 97% of neighborhoods).|$|E
25|$|Randi {{said the}} hardest people to fool {{are not the}} highly educated, but <b>children,</b> <b>because</b> they are not {{sophisticated}} enough to be fooled, as they have not learned the body cues that adults have learned and magicians take advantage of.|$|E
