A sodium chloride dip has also been shown to inhibit browning and this study examined its interaction with various forms of ascorbate on the postharvest life of apple slices. Comparison of the effectiveness of ascorbate moieties showed that the concentration of ascorbic acid required to achieve any desired postharvest life was twice that of <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate,</b> but <b>calcium,</b> sodium and potassium ascorbates were equally effective in inhibiting browning. The inclusion of 0. 1 mol/l sodium chloride into a dip requires only half the concentration of ascorbate to maintain the same postharvest life. The very low cost of sodium chloride means that materials in such a dip are about half the cost of an ascorbate-only solution. Since 0. 1 mol/l sodium chloride does not affect the taste of apple slices and is an allowable food additive, it should be considered as a cost effective partial replacement of ascorbate in commercial dips.

40|$|Osteoporosis is {{a disease}} {{resulting}} from bone loss and from the structural deterioration of bone tissue. Yet osteoporosis is both controllable and preventable. In terms of prevention, {{a good source of}} calcium supplementation is important in promoting strong, healthy bones. The bioavailability of <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> and <b>calcium</b> acetate was studied in an animal model using a radioactive tracer technique. At two dosage levels, <b>calcium</b> from <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> was absorbed higher than from calcium acetate, indicating <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> is a better bioavailable calcium supplement. Alpha-lactalbumin, a whey protein fraction, further enhanced calcium absorption from both salts in an animal model. Therefore, <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> in combination with alpha-lactalbumin was a superior bioavailable calcium source. ^ Several animal and short-term human studies indicate that isoflavones may be used as an alternative therapy to estrogen replacement therapy. However, the results were contradictory. The inadequacy of information and controversy on skeletal effects of isoflavones led us to design the present study to test the effectiveness of soy isoflavones on treating osteoporosis in comparison to the estrogen replacement therapy in an adult animal model for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Unmated 6 mo. old ovariectomized and sham operated female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 9 groups (16 rats/group). Calcium metabolic balance, bone densitometry, bone histomorphometry and bone mechanical testing were used to investigate calcium and bone metabolism. After ovariectomy, estrogen prevented bone loss in trabecular bone and suppressed formation on both trabecular and cortical bone surfaces. Isoflavones given as soy protein or supplements did not prevent trabecular bone loss. Combining isoflavones with estrogen had no additional benefits. None of the treatments affected calcium absorption or calcium balance significantly. Therefore, we conclude that soy isoflavones did not alter calcium metabolism or bone metabolism at the doses tested. ...|$|R

Kinetic modeling enables the rapid assessment of changes that occur associated with age, therapeutic intervention. Therefore, calcium metabolism was investigated using kinetic analysis in rats via several independent studies. ^ First, calcium absorption from two different <b>calcium</b> salts, <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> and <b>calcium</b> acetate, was compared. As measured by femur uptake, fractional calcium absorption from <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> was substantially higher than that from calcium acetate (70 % ± 5 vs. 45 % ± 5) on a 25 mg test load. To further confirm this observation, a metabolic study was conducted. Four groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10 /group) received oral or intravenous doses of 25 mg Ca as <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> or <b>calcium</b> acetate. Each dose contained 25 μCi 45 Ci. Sequential blood, urine and fecal samples were collected over 48 hours. Data was analyzed by compartmental modeling. Results of kinetic analysis demonstrated that the higher absorption of <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> was due to a longer residence time in the gut. ^ Secondly, the effect of Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) on calcium metabolism in growing rats was examined using the same kinetic model. IGF-I is an important mediator during pubertal skeletal growth, and has been considered as a potential treatment for osteoporosis. Measurement of bone quality and calcium metabolism were first determined in rats from age 6 weeks to 31 weeks {{in order to determine}} the timing for IGF-I intervention. Human recombinant IGF-I/IGFBP- 3 complex was chronically infused into female rats at two different ages: 6 and 9 weeks of age, representing early puberty and young adulthood in humans. After 4 weeks of treatment, body weights of IGF-I treated rats were higher than control rats. Femoral calcium content was also significantly higher in IGF-I treated pubertal rats, 493 ± 42, compared to control rats, 368 ± 24 mg calcium/g ash weight. Kinetic analysis revealed the treatment resulted in higher intestinal calcium absorption and faster calcium clearance from the circulation in pubertal rats. However, the IGF-I treatment failed to alter calcium metabolism in young adult rats. ...|$|R

40|$|Vitamin C is {{essential}} for primates, guinea pigs and fish. Vitamin C, {{in the form of}} ascorbic acid and its calcium and sodium salts, ascorbyl palmitate, sodium calcium ascorbyl phosphate and sodium ascorbyl phosphate, is safe for all animal species. Setting a maximum content in feed and water for drinking is not considered necessary. Data on the vitamin C consumption of consumers are based on the levels of vitamin C in foodstuffs, including food of animal origin, produced in accordance with current EU legislation on the supplementation of feed with vitamin C. The exposure is far below the guidance level. Any potential contribution of the use of vitamin C in feed is therefore already considered in the above data. Consequently, the use of vitamin C in animal nutrition is not of concern for consumer safety. In the absence of inhalation toxicity studies it would be prudent to assume that inhalation of dust from the additives presents a health hazard to workers. Sodium calcium ascorbyl phosphate is not an irritant to skin and eyes and is unlikely to be a skin sensitiser. This conclusion is extrapolated to sodium ascorbyl phosphate. In the absence of data, ascorbic acid, sodium <b>ascorbate,</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> and ascorbyl palmitate should be considered as irritant to skin and eyes and as dermal sensitisers. The supplementation of feed with vitamin C does not pose a risk to the environment.

RESULTS: PCAAS for 1 or 2 weeks prior to slicing had an overall {{positive effect on the}} resultant quality of fresh-cut apple slices. The most significant responses to PCAAS were the suppression of both phenolic and o-quinone accumulation in slices, and this was related to the significantly lower browning potential values obtained for slices from PCAAS-treated apples. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POX) and ascorbate peroxidase (APOX) activities were not affected by 1 -MCP or PCAAS treatments. PPO and POX activities were almost completely inhibited by a 50 g L- 1 <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> anti-browning dip of apple slices from all treatments. CONCLUSION: The most dramatic effect of the PCAAS treatments was to reduce the accumulation of soluble phenolics, which is likely the reason that o-quinone accumulation was also inhibited in treated fruits.

Compared to ascorbic acid (AA), {{the most common form of}} vitamin C, EC can be consumed by a wider range of individuals due to its neutralized pH which allows for supplementation at high doses with greater tolerability for people who are sensitive to acidic foods (Gruenwald et al. 2006; Ye et al. 2015). Evidence suggests that EC may also have a higher bioavailability. Studies show that pre-incubation of cells with threonate results in a stimulated uptake of vitamin C in a dose-dependent manner (Fay et al. 1994; Fay and Verlangieri 1991). In rodents, higher plasma concentrations and less rapid excretion (Bush and Verlangieri 1987) as well as more available vitamin C activities (Verlangieri et al. 1991) have been observed in comparison with AA. Human studies comparing vitamin C levels of EC and AA are not consistent in plasma (Moyad et al. 2008; Wright et al. 1990; Johnston and Luo 1994; Pancorbo et al. 2008), but significantly higher leukocyte vitamin C levels have been constantly observed with EC than AA in male subjects (unpublished observations) (Moyad et al. 2008; Wright and Kirk 1990).|$|R

A firmness experiment was conducted by dipping fresh-cut rose apples in 200  mg/L SC and in 200  mg/L SC combined with 20  g/L CC and 20  g/L CaAs (SC + CC + CaAs) for 3  min before storage at 4  ±  2  °C for 9  d. Samples immersed in filtered water were used as the control. The combined treatment delayed microbial contamination and browning by reducing the PPO activity and the accumulation of phenolic content, and maintained the fresh firmness of fresh-cut rose apples. Thus, the combination treatment of SC + CC + CaAs solution can protect fresh-cut rose apples against microbial contamination and delay browning and maintain firmness...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{combined}} technological {{approach was}} {{applied in the}} development of healthier dry fermented sausages: a partial substitution of the pork back fat by pre-emulsified linseed oil and a partial replacement of sodium chloride with <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> at two different levels, leading to low amounts of salt (14 gSalt and 10 gSalt, with 14 g and 10 g NaCl per kg of mixture, respectively). RESULTS: The developed products (14 gSalt and 10 gSalt) showed adequate results for a(w) (0. 85 and 0. 87) and pH (4. 98 and 5. 21), and low lipid oxidation values (1. 4 × 10 (- 4) and 1. 5 × 10 (- 5) g malondialdehyde (MDA) kg(- 1)). The lipid modification led to a significantly higher supply of ω- 3 (23. 3 g kg(- 1)) compared to the control (3. 2 g kg(- 1)). Simultaneously, reductions of 38 % and 50 % in sodium content and a calcium supply of 4 and 5. 2 g kg(- 1) were achieved in the 14 gSalt and 10 gSalt formulations, respectively, compared to the control products (26 g salt and 0. 87 g kg(- 1) Ca). Instrumental analysis of colour and texture and sensory studies demonstrated that the organoleptic quality of the new formulations was similar to that of traditional products. CONCLUSIONS: The developed dry fermented sausages showed healthier properties than traditional ones owing to their reduced sodium and higher calcium content and a significant supply of ω- 3 fatty acid...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the International Conference “Environmentally {{friendly}} and safe technologies for quality {{of fruit and}} vegetables”, held in Universidade do Algarve, Faro, Portugal, on January 14 - 16, 2009. This Conference was a join activity with COST Action 924. The physiological bases for the effectiveness of technologies used in fresh-cut fruit were examined {{in an attempt to}} foster the shift from a market-pull to a science-push innovation model. Respiration rate of fresh-cut ‘Rocha’ pear were measured at various oxygen concentrations. Apparent Km values for oxygen uptake were very close to the fermentation thresholds, indicating that it is physiologically impossible to reduce the respiration rate of fresh-cut pear by more than 50 % without inducing fermentation. Based on this information, we hypothesize that optimizing oxygen concentration inside packages is of little or no value in fresh-cut pears. Additionally, additives used to reduce enzymic browning and softening may have pleiotropic effects on quality. It was found that pH significantly affected the rate and intensity of browning of fresh-cut pears. Browning was more intense in pears treated at pH 3. 0 and less pronounced at pH 7. 0, but the softening rate was lower at the latter pH value. Calcium salts also affected texture and color in a salt-specific manner. Larger color changes were observed with propionate and lactate. Although <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> reduced color changes, fruit slices treated with this salt were softer than those treated with calcium propionate, lactate or chloride. Based on the physiological information gathered, we will develop and evaluate an integrated process to maximize the quality of fresh-cut ‘Rocha’ pear throughout the distribution chain...|$|R
40|$|Respiratory {{behavior}} of fresh-cut ‘Rocha’ pear suggests that optimization of O 2 concentration inside modified atmosphere packages (MAP) is of limited benefit. To test this hypothesis, packages {{were designed to}} achieve three equilibrium O 2 partial pressures. Fresh-cut ‘Rocha’ pear was treated with 250 mM <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> solutions buffered at pH 3. 0 and pH 7. 0, packaged under the three MAP conditions, and stored at 5 ◦C for 20 d. Actual O 2 levels (mean ± confidence interval at 95 %) during the experiment were 16. 7 ± 0. 2, 1. 8 ± 0. 2 and 0. 25 ± 0. 04 kPa with corresponding CO 2 levels of 1. 3 ± 0. 1, 4. 3 ± 0. 2 and 6. 5 ± 0. 4 kPa. Changes in quality attributes related to fruit metabolism, namely firmness, titratable acidity, pH, and soluble solids content were not affected by O 2 levels. Overall changes in water activity, levels of ascorbate, and microbial growth were also independent of O 2 levels. Oxygen partial pressure inside the packages affected browning, which was more intense at 16. 7 kPa O 2. Sensory analyses performed after 8 d in storage confirmed that panelists perceived the differences in color but did not detect differences in firmness or taste among the samples under different O 2 levels. Browning was more intense at pH 3. 0 than at pH 7. 0 but the kinetics of other quality attributes were not affected by pH. No significant improvements of quality attributes dependent on the physiology of respiration of fresh-cut ‘Rocha’ pear {{can be obtained by}} reducing O 2 partial pressure inside the packages...|$|R
40|$|NMR {{studies of}} water oxygen- 17 {{relaxation}} in aqueous sucrose and lysozyme solutions {{have been carried}} out to investigate the interactions of water with sucrose and lysozyme. The effect of sucrose and lysozyme concentration on water oxygen- 17 relaxation has been studied in detail. The dependence of relaxation on frequency and pH has also been analysed. The existing model, describing the relaxation of water oxygen- 17 in aqueous protein solutions suggested by Halle in 1981, is tested to see whether it gives a true representation. It is found that at low concentrations of sucrose and lysozyme, the experimental data give good agreement with the model. However, at saturated sucrose concentration the agreement is not so good. An extra contribution to the transverse relaxation rate is seen. A possible explanation for the extra contribution to the transverse relaxation rate at high sucrose content is discussed. The effect of ionic charge on oxygen- 17 relaxation in lysozyme solutions is also investigated. It is observed that both the ionic charge of lysozyme as well as lysozyme aggregation strongly affect the relaxation of water oxygen- 17. A method for analysing the experimental data for water oxygen- 17 relaxation in aqueous sucrose and lysozyme solutions using Halle's model is presented and employed to calculate the various parameters of the model. The relaxation and chemical shift of calcium- 43 in simple calcium salts, calcium acetate and <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> have been studied as a function of concentration and pH. The complexation of calcium to sucrose and to lysozyme has also been investigated. In almost all cases, a significant calcium- 43 chemical shift has been detected. The direct measurement of complexation and binding of calcium by relaxation time and chemical shift measurements has been of particular interest...|$|R
40|$|Processing of pears as a fresh-cut product {{could offer}} added value and {{introduce}} a product {{into the market}} that offers greater convenience and health benefits for consumers. Cultivar selection {{is one of the}} most important considerations for fresh-cut fruit processing because characteristics such as flesh texture, skin colour, and browning potential can vary greatly among cultivars. Four pear cultivars (‘Flor de invierno’, ‘Passe-Crassane’, ‘Ercolini’ and ‘Conference’) and four antioxidant treatments, that is, (NS) 50 g L- 1 NatureSeal® AS 1 (Agricoat) solution, (AsAc) 20 g L- 1 ascorbic acid + 10 g L- 1 citric acid + 10 g L- 1 calcium chloride solution, (CaAs) 20 g L- 1 <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> + 10 g L- 1 calcium chloride solution and (NaAs) 20 g L- 1 sodium ascorbate + 10 g L- 1 calcium chloride solution, were tested to obtain a high-quality fresh-cut pear. For the selected cultivar and treatment, the nutritional changes and physicochemical, microbial and sensorial quality were evaluated under conditions that simulated commercial application followed by storage at 4 °C and a simulated cold chain break at 8 °C. The ‘Conference’ pear was selected as the best cultivar based on its physicochemical characteristics (high levels of soluble solids content and low acidity), low increase in browning index, and visual acceptance after 7 days of storage. The results demonstrated that CaAs maintained the fresh-cut pear quality after 8 days of storage at 4 °C and also after a cold chain break. Furthermore, application of the selected treatment produced an increase in the ascorbic acid content, total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of minimally processed pear samples. These values were reduced during shelf life, but the total phenolic content at the final sampling point was higher than that of fresh-cut pears after processing without treatment.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{presence}} of food and food components, including lignin, inositol phosphates, milk proteins, and kale on calcium absorption in rats was studied by femur uptake of 45 Ca. Generally, the single test meals contained 25 mg Ca as <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> and 6 μCi 45 Ca plus either water as a control or various test substances. ^ Lignin was isolated from kale and wheat bran by enzymatic or acidic treatment. Calcium absorption {{in the presence of the}} isolated lignins, commercial pine lignin, or original wheat bran was studied. The test meals contained 30 mg lignin or 0. 5 g wheat bran. Wheat bran showed an inhibitory effect on calcium absorption. No inhibitory effect was found among the various lignin sources. Thus, lignin is unlikely to be the inhibitory constituent to calcium absorption in plant foods. ^ Inositol phosphates (InsPs) were prepared by an enzymatic method and separated by ion-chromatography. Calcium absorption in the presence of phytic acid, inositol tetraphosphate (Ins(1, 2, 3, 6) P 4, Ins(1, 2, 5, 6) P 5), or inositol pentophosphate (Ins(1, 2, 3, 5, 6) P 5) was studied. It was found that the inhibitory effect of phytate and the enhancing effect of Ins(1, 2, 3, 6) P 4 on calcium absorption were dose-related. No difference was found in calcium absorption between Ins(1, 2, 5, 6) P 5 or Ins(1, 2, 3, 5, 6) P 5 and the control. Thus, these inositol phosphates with no-inhibitory or even an enhancing effect as a result of dephosphorylation of phytate have important implications in processed foods. ^ Bovine casein and whey proteins were prepared by ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration. Calcium absorption in the presence of the casein, whey, and commercial α-lactalbumin at two calcium:protein ratios were studied. Casein was not inhibitory to calcium absorption. The strong enhancing effect of concentrated whey proteins or α-lactalbumin was dose-related. Therefore, whey proteins and/or α-lactalbumin have a great potential as an enhancer for calcium absorption. ^ Kale sap was found to have an enhancing effect on calcium absorption. Amino acids, sugars, and organic acids found in kale were not responsible for the enhancing effect of kale. The enhancing effect of kale sap was reduced significantly by cooking or dehydration. Thus, the potential calcium enhancer appears to be as a labile compound. ...|$|R
