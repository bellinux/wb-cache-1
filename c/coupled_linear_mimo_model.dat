40|$|Passive {{in-vehicle}} {{safety systems}} such as the air bag and the belt restrain the occupant during a crash. However, often their behavior is not optimal in terms of occupant injuries. This paper discusses an approach to design an ideal restraint system. The problem is formulated as a feedback tracking problem with the objective to force the controlled variables, i. e., the acceleration {{of the head and}} the chest of the occupant, to follow a priori defined reference signals by simultaneous manipulation of the belt and the air bag. The reference signals have to reflect minimal injuries to the head, the chest, and the neck. More or less realistic numerical models of a crash test are far too complex to be used in control design processes. Therefore, a strategy is presented to derive simple, <b>linear</b> <b>MIMO</b> <b>models.</b> These models approximate the local dynamic behavior of the complex model and are suitable for control design. Analysis of the interactions in these simple models makes it plausible that the control design problem can be split into two separate tracking problems. Next, stabilizing low order controllers are designed using these models, and implemented in the closed loop system with the realistic numerical model. Results are presented, suggesting that feedback control with low order controllers is extremely effective as a basis for ideal restraint systems. Reductions of the adopted injury measures of at least 40 % in comparison with the uncontrolled restraint system are achieved...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new behavioral model for analog RF circuits. The new model approximates non-linear filtering effects for base-band (i. e. suppressed carrier) end-to-end systems analysis. The new model, the K-model, is a <b>linear</b> <b>MIMO</b> (multi-input-multi-output) <b>model</b> with output radius corrected by a non-linear SISO (single-input-single output) model. The SISO model uses a multi-tanh structure to synthesize a non-linear filter. The multi-tanh structure simulates non-linear behavior by gently switching between transfer functions as the base-band input varies. For excursions {{well into the}} steady state non-linear region of operation the K-model simulates large-signal base-band transients to within about 10 % of those simulated with detailed unsuppressed-carrier models. 1.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} the average and outage performance of spatial multiplexing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with channel state information at {{both sides of}} the link. Such systems result, for example, from exploiting the channel eigenmodes in multiantenna systems. Due to the complexity of obtaining the exact expression for the av-erage bit error rate (BER) and the outage probability, we derive approximations in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime assuming an uncorrelated Rayleigh flat-fading channel. More exactly, capitalizing on previous work by Wang and Giannakis, the average BER and outage probability versus SNR curves of spatial multiplexing MIMO systems are characterized in terms of two key parameters: the array gain and the diversity gain. Finally, these results are applied to analyze the performance of a variety of <b>linear</b> <b>MIMO</b> transceiver designs available in the literature.
