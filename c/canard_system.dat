This thesis asks, "What is the role of communication technologies in a social constructionalist approach to community-centered messaging?" Towards answering this question, a framework is described for developing and assessing such a system. This framework accounts for the varying skills of the community members, the amount of support the network provider is willing to invest, and the effort needed to use tools. A well designed system can meet the ambitions of the community that employs them, while a poor design leads to frustration and apathy. An experimental platform, Canard, has been built in order to explore this framework. It provides a unified communication representation and tools that allow rapid development of community-centered communication applications that do not require significant expertise to use them. The <b>Canard</b> <b>system</b> has been used by diverse communities over the past two years with varying degrees of success. The degree of success is a function of the group's ambition and willingness to participate in the process of crafting communication solutions for personal and community benefit. by Pascal Roger Chesnais.

We employed and tested the resulting computational methods for an extended normal form of a folded node. Taking into account the nature of the slow flow and its normal direction, we were able to compute different relevant parts of attracting and saddle slow manifolds in the neighborhood of a folded node. The flexibility of our method also enabled us to compute two-dimensional submanifolds of the three-dimensional stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle slow manifold.|$|R

In parallel, since the late 1990 s several papers have shown that the canard phenomenon can be faithfully reproduced with piecewise-linear (PWL) systems in two dimensions although very few results are available in the three-dimensional case. The present paper aims to bridge this gap by analysing canonical PWL systems that display folded singularities, primary and secondary canards, with a similar control of the maximal winding number as in the smooth case. We also show that the singular phase portraits are compatible in both frameworks. Finally, we show on an example how to construct a (linear) global return and obtain robust PWL MMOs.

40|$|Torus canards are {{solutions}} of slow/fast {{systems that}} alternate between attracting and repelling manifolds of limit cycles {{of the fast}} subsystem. A relatively new dynamic phenomenon, torus canards {{have been found in}} neural applications to mediate the transition from spiking to bursting via amplitude-modulated spiking. In R^ 3, torus canards are degenerate: they require one-parameter families of 2 -fast/ 1 -slow systems in order to be observed and even then, they only occur on exponentially thin parameter intervals. The addition of a second slow variable unfolds the torus canard phenomenon, making them generic and robust. That is, torus <b>canards</b> in slow/fast <b>systems</b> with (at least) two slow variables occur on open parameter sets. So far, generic torus canards have only been studied numerically, and their behaviour has been inferred based on averaging and canard theory. This approach, however, has not been rigorously justified since the averaging method breaks down near a fold of periodics, which is exactly where torus canards originate. In this work, we combine techniques from Floquet theory, averaging theory, and geometric singular perturbation theory to show that the average of a torus canard is a folded singularity canard. In so doing, we devise an analytic scheme for the identification and topological classification of torus canards in R^ 4. We demonstrate the predictive power of our results in a model for intracellular calcium dynamics, where we explain the mechanisms underlying a novel class of elliptic bursting rhythms, called amplitude-modulated bursting, by constructing the torus canard analogues of mixed-mode oscillations. We also make explicit the connection between our results here with prior studies of torus canards and torus canard explosion in R^ 3, and discuss how our methods can be extended to slow/fast systems of arbitrary (finite) dimension.
