The comparative study of the composition of <b>commercial</b> copaiba <b>oils</b> {{was carried out by}} high resolution gas chromatography (HRGC) and high resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HRGC-MS) analysis. The <b>commercial</b> <b>oils</b> were compared with authentic oils, collected from the southeast and northern regions of Brazil.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{characterize}} the major and minor compounds of laboratory-extracted and <b>commercial</b> <b>oils</b> from sweet almond, hazelnut, and pecan nut. Oils from sweet almond, hazelnut, and pecan nut were obtained {{by means of an}} expeller system, while the corresponding <b>commercial</b> <b>oils</b> were provided from Vital Âtman (BR). The contents of triacylglycerols, fatty acids, aliphatic and terpenic alcohols, desmethyl-, methyl-, and dimethylsterols, squalene, and tocopherols were determined. Oleic, palmitic, and linoleic acids were the main fatty acids. Desmethylsterols were the principal minor compounds with β-sitosterol being the most abundant component. Low amounts of aliphatic and terpenic alcohols were also found. The major tocopherol in hazelnut and sweet almond oils was α-tocopherol, whereas γ-tocopherol prevailed in pecan nut oil. Principal component analysis made it possible for us to differentiate among samples, as well as to distinguish between <b>commercial</b> and laboratory-extracted <b>oils.</b> Heatmap highlighted the main variables featuring each sample.

40|$|This work tackles {{the study}} of the quality and {{authenticity}} of oils labeled and commercialized as extra virgin sacha inchi oil. Major and minor components as triglycerides, fatty acid methyl esters, tocopherols, sterols and hydrocarbons are determined as well as other physicochemical parameters (density, viscosity, acidity and peroxide value). The results showed that some of the commercialized oils do not fulfill the basic requirement established in the regulation such as the content of α-linolenic acid, higher than 44. 7 or 55. 0 % in the cases of P. volubilis and P. huayllabambana, respectively. The calculated stigmasterol/campesterol ratio for genuine sacha inchi oils should be around 4, however not all <b>commercial</b> <b>oils</b> analyzed comply with this requirement. The presence of the flavons sesamin and sesamolin indicates the addition of compounds from sesame oils. Finally, some of the <b>commercial</b> <b>oils</b> showed to contain trans fatty acids although this was not accompanied by the sterene hydrocarbon presence...|$|R
25|$|The first <b>commercial</b> <b>oil</b> well in Canada became {{operational}} in 1858 at Oil Springs, Ontario (then Canada West). Businessman James Miller Williams dug several wells between 1855 and 1858 before {{discovering a}} rich reserve of oil four metres below ground. Williams extracted 1.5 million litres {{of crude oil}} by 1860, refining much of it into kerosene lamp oil. Williams's well became commercially viable a year before Drake's Pennsylvania operation and could be argued {{to be the first}} <b>commercial</b> <b>oil</b> well in North America. The discovery at Oil Springs touched off an oil boom which brought hundreds of speculators and workers to the area. Advances in drilling continued into 1862 when local driller Shaw reached a depth of 62 metres using the spring-pole drilling method. On January 16, 1862, after an explosion of natural gas Canada's first oil gusher came into production, shooting into the air at a recorded rate of 3,000 barrels per day. By the end of the 19th century the Russian Empire, particularly the Branobel company in Azerbaijan, had taken the lead in production.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} using a purpose-built {{test rig}} {{to examine the}} effect of oil chemistry on the charging ability of various oils revealed that the charge produced depends on two extrinsic properties; the electric field (used to charge the droplet) and the droplet radius. A normalization parameter was developed from these dependencies and used to compare the results from the tests described herein. Four classes of liquids were tested. These were pure hydrocarbon liquids (hexadecane, decane, and squalane), base oils (both mineral and synthetic stocks), formulated oils (mineral base oil with additives), and <b>commercial</b> <b>oils</b> (fully formulated mineral and synthetic oils, available over-the-counter). The charging for both pure hydrocarbons and base oils indicates that the charged species have a low mobility and thus are likely to be large, bulky molecules. For this reason, the charging of the base oils is noticeably time dependent and the charge imparted on the oil did not always reach saturation. The charging (rate) of base oils appears to follow the level of impurities (particularly sulfur). Generally, both pure hydrocarbons and base oils tend to charge more when a positive field is applied. Conductivity values help to explain the measured charge levels. This would be expected as conductivity is related to the ionic species (charge carriers) present. The majority of the formulated and <b>commercial</b> <b>oils</b> tested reached charge saturation for all conditions tested, resulting in a normalized value of around 0. 1 pC mm? 1 V? 1, comparable with a theoretical calculated value. The formulated and <b>commercial</b> <b>oils</b> that did not reach saturation have conductivities comparable with base oils and therefore behave in a fashion similar to the base oils...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the antimicrobial activity of aqueous, ethanolic, methanolic and phenolic extracts from three Palestinian folkloric medicinal plants {{in addition to}} their <b>commercial</b> <b>oils</b> against ten pathogenic microorganisms. Methods: The plants studied were sage, thyme and parsley. Five concentrations of leaf extract of each of the three plants were prepared. The antimicrobial effect of each concentration was measured. Results: Aqueous extracts of sage and thyme had action against most of the tested microorganisms. Phenolic extract of sage and thyme showed antibacterial activity against Staph. aureus and Enterococ-cus sp, respectively. On the other hand, E. coli was more affected by the ethanolic extract of parsley. While, that extract does not elicit pronounce effect on the tested Gram positive organisms. The results of <b>commercial</b> <b>oils</b> of sage, thyme and parsley displayed no antimicrobial activity against E. coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhi.

2500|$|Immediately {{following}} his Oman expedition, in early 1926, Lees was posted to Bahrain. While accepting {{that there were}} oil prospects in Cretaceous or older rocks, he gave it a distinctly low rating {{in comparison with the}} numerous Asmari Limestone prospects available in the region generally, most of them in Persia or Iraq. Lees' views at that time were greatly influenced by De Böckh, who considered Bahrain unlikely to yield oil in comparable quantity with structures in the Zagros foothills and had doubts whether any important amount would be found where the Asmari Limestone is missing (which it was in Bahrain). Lister James, who had been favourably impressed with Bahrain several years earlier, was still chief geologist for Anglo-Persian but De Böckh had been retained as the company's chief geological adviser for several years, and his opinion, supplemented by the report of Lees, prevailed with the management. At a lecture he delivered a few months before the discovery of oil in Bahrain, Lees summed up the evidence for and against finding oil in commercial quantities in Bahrain as an even chance.
