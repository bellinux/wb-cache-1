50|$|Pseudoproline a {{powerful}} tool for improving the quality of synthetic peptides. Pseudoproline dipeptides have greatly increased the success rate for synthesizing both long and difficult peptides. Pseudoproline dipeptides can be introduced {{in the same manner as}} other amino acid derivatives. The routine use of pseudoproline (oxazolidine) dipeptides in the FMOC solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) of serine- and threonine-containing peptides leads to remarkable improvements in quality and yield of <b>crude</b> <b>products</b> and helps avoid unnecessary repeat synthesis of failed sequences. Pseudoproline dipeptides have proven particularly effective in the synthesis of intractable peptides, long peptides/small proteins, and cyclic peptides, enabling in many cases the production of peptides that otherwise could not be made. These dipeptides are extremely easy to use: simply substitute a serine or threonine residue together with the preceding amino acid residue in the peptide sequence with the appropriate pseudoproline dipeptide (see the figure on your right). The native sequence is regenerated on cleavage and deprotection.|$|E

40|$|A {{program has}} been {{initiated}} towards the chemical profiling of chemical warfare agents, {{in order to support}} forensic investigations towards synthesis routes, production sites and suspect chemical suppliers. Within the first stage of the project various chemical warfare agents (VX, sulfur mustard, sarin) have been prepared according to well-known or more obscure quick-and-dirty synthesis protocols. After minimal work-up, the <b>crude</b> <b>products</b> were analyzed with GC-MS, affording highly useful mass spectral data sets of byproducts. The intact agents were present at moderate to high levels in most <b>crude</b> <b>products.</b> In several cases it was possible to correlate the applied synthesis route to the formation of unique byproducts, or to a characteristic ratio of byproducts. It was also assessed that {{for the majority of the}} <b>crude</b> <b>products</b> the chemical profile remained more or less intact upon prolonged storage. This was remarkable because it was expected that the <b>crude</b> <b>products</b> would decompose rather quickly because of the presence of traces of acid. In the current presentation, the focus will lie on the results obtained for VX. Inter alia, the stability of the chemical profile was assessed for the crude VX batches in/on several matrices (soil, water, wood, textile and rubber). Dependent on the matrix, VX could be detected up to several weeks after liquid extraction or thermodesorption followed by GC-MS analysis, while for some of the <b>crude</b> <b>products</b> the characteristic byproducts could still be detected...|$|E

40|$|Aminopropyl-functionalized {{hexagonal}} {{mesoporous silica}} (HMS) products, as {{are of interest}} for CO 2 capture applications, were separately prepared by mixing aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTS) and HMS in toluene via a conventional stirred reactor and via sonication assisted methods, to investigate the potential of sonication to facilitate the preparation of products with higher tether loadings and correspondingly higher CO 2 sorption capacities. Sonication was expected to improve both the dispersion of the substrate in the solvent and the diffusion of the silane throughout the mesoporous substrate. Structural properties of the products were determined by X-ray diffraction, N 2 adsorption/desorption (77 [*]K), helium pycnometry, and elemental analysis, and CO 2 adsorption/desorption properties were determined via thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis.
