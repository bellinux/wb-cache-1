5|$|At first Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang {{is just a}} big and {{powerful}} car, but as the book progresses the car surprises the family by beginning to exhibit independent actions. This first happens while the family is caught in a traffic jam {{on their way to}} the beach for a picnic. The car suddenly instructs Commander Pott to pull a switch which causes Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang to sprout wings and take flight over the stopped <b>cars</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> Commander Pott flies them to Goodwin Sands in the English Channel where the family picnics, swims, and sleeps. While the family naps, the tide comes in threatening to drown them. Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang wakes them just in time with a hiss of steam. At the car's direction, Commander Pott pulls another switch which causes it to transform into a hovercraft-like vehicle. They make for the French coast and land on a beach near Calais. They explore along the beach and find a cave boobytrapped with some devices intended to scare off intruders. At the back of the cave is a store of armaments and explosives. The family detonates the cache of explosives and flees the cave.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{economic}} difficulties {{faced by the}} first Wilson government, it succeeded in maintaining low levels of unemployment and inflation during its time in office. Unemployment was kept below 2.7%, and inflation {{for much of the}} 1960s remained below 4%. Living standards generally improved, while public spending on housing, social security, transport, research, education and health went up by an average of more than 6% between 1964 and 1970. The average household grew steadily richer, with the number of cars in the United Kingdom rising from one to every 6.4 persons to one for every five persons in 1968, representing a net increase of three million <b>cars</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> The rise in the standard of living was also characterised by increased ownership of various consumer durables from 1964 to 1969, as demonstrated by television sets (from 88% to 90%), refrigerators (from 39% to 59%), and washing machines (from 54% to 64%).|$|E
25|$|While {{customer}} {{reaction to}} the EV1 was positive, GM believed that electric cars occupied an unprofitable niche of the automobile market, and ended up crushing most of the cars, regardless of protesting customers. Furthermore, an alliance of the major automakers litigated the CARB regulation in court, resulting in a slackening of the ZEV stipulation, permitting the companies to produce super-low-emissions vehicles, natural gas vehicles, and hybrid cars in place of pure electrics. The EV1 program was subsequently discontinued in 2002, and all <b>cars</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> were repossessed. Lessees were not given the option to purchase their cars from GM, which cited parts, service, and liability regulations. The majority of the repossessed EV1s were crushed, and about 40 were delivered to museums and educational institutes with their electric powertrains deactivated, under the agreement that the cars {{were not to be}} reactivated and driven on the road. About 20 units were donated to overseas institutions. In 2016, the TV show Jay Leno's Garage presented an intact EV1 part of the collection of famous filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. The only intact EV1 was donated to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E

500|$|UCLA law {{professor}} Gary T. Schwartz, in a Rutgers Law Review article (see Section 7.3 NHTSA Investigation above), studied the fatality {{rates of the}} Pinto and several other small cars of the time period. [...] He noted that fires, and rear-end fires in particular, are very small portion of overall auto fatalities. [...] At the time only 1% of automobile crashes would result in fire and only 4% of fatal accidents involved fire, and only 15% of fatal fire crashes {{are the result of}} rear-end collisions. [...] When considering the overall safety of the Pinto, Schwartz notes that subcompact cars as a class have generally higher fatality risk. [...] Pintos represented 1.9% of all <b>cars</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> in the 1975–76 period. [...] During that time the car represented 1.9% of all [...] "fatal accidents accompanied by some fire." [...] Implying the car was average for all cars and slightly above average for its class. [...] When all types of fatalities are considered the Pinto was approximately even with the AMC Gremlin, Chevrolet Vega, and Datsun 510. [...] It was significantly better than the Datsun 1200/210, Toyota Corolla and VW Beetle. [...] The safety record of the car in terms of fire was average or slightly below average for compacts and all cars respectively. [...] This was considered respectable for a subcompact car. [...] Only when considering the narrow subset of rear-impact, fire fatalities is the car somewhat worse than the average for subcompact cars. [...] While acknowledging this is an important legal point, Schwartz rejects the portrayal of the car as a firetrap.|$|E
500|$|The {{final stage}} of the rally took place on Sunday morning. After {{conducting}} the entire race in France the organisers only paid {{lip service to the}} principality by holding a Super Special Stage there. It involved two laps of part of the Circuit de Monaco for a total distance of , with two <b>cars</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> at the same time but starting at two different points along the track so that they did not interfere with each other. Because the Service Park was in Valence, repairs, adjustments, refuelling and tyre changes were carried out on Saturday night ahead of the drive down to the coast. The decision about which tyres to fit on the cars was taken out of the teams' hands. ACM ordered that all the cars would drive on the snow tyres that the teams had been allocated, but had not been used because of the dry weather, a decision that was described as [...] "absurd" [...] because the cars ended up drifting through the corners. Loeb's, Sordo's and Grönholm's lead times so far ahead of anyone else's, so the interest in Stage 15 was on Hirvonen and Atkinson. Only eight-tenths of a second made the difference between a fourth-place position and five points, and fifth-placed position and four points. Hirvonen, who was in fourth place, completed the stage in , and admitted, [...] " [...] a few small mistakes, and that can be it. Nothing more I can do. We'll see how Chris drives and hope for the best.". Atkinson drove opposite Grönholm on the stage, with Hirvonen watching from the sidelines. To beat Hirvonen, he had to complete the stage in [...] He was one-tenth of a second quicker than that, which won him the stage and fourth place in the rally.|$|E
