Three varieties of Linseed were trialled: Riga Crown, an early maturing variety, Italian also early maturing and Walsh, a mid-season maturing variety. It was discovered that all were susceptible to <b>cutworm</b> with greater damage occurring later in the season; early trails of the insecticide DDT was said to show promising results in combating this.|$|E
5|$|Only four {{species of}} {{reptiles}} are {{documented in the}} park: three species of snakes which are the wandering garter snake, the less commonly seen valley garter snake and rubber boa, {{as well as one}} lizard species, the northern sagebrush lizard, that was first reported in 1992. None of the species are venomous. Six amphibian species have been documented including the Columbia spotted frog, boreal chorus frog, tiger salamander and the increasingly rare boreal toad and northern leopard frog. A sixth amphibian species, the bullfrog, was introduced. An estimated 10,000 insect species frequent the park; they pollinate plants, provide a food source for birds, fish, mammals and other animals, and help in the decomposition of wood. In one example of the importance of insects to the ecosystem, swarms of Army <b>cutworm</b> moths die in huge numbers after mating and provide a high fat and protein diet for bears and other predators. One study concluded that when this moth species is most available, bears consume 40,000 moths per day which is roughly 20,000kcal/day.|$|E

40|$|As {{noted in}} the May 28, 2001, Integrated Crop Management newsletter, alfalfa fields should have been scouted for {{variegated}} <b>cutworms</b> following the first cutting. Variegated <b>cutworms</b> are now causing a delay in alfalfa regrowth in scattered locations across Iowa. Some <b>cutworms</b> are nearly full grown at 11 / 4 - 11 / 2 inches but others are only 5 / 8 - 3 / 4 inch in length. These smaller <b>cutworms</b> will continue to feed for another 21 - 24 days, depending on weather conditions.

2500|$|Canadian or Alaskan grizzlies {{are larger}} than those that reside in the American Rocky Mountains. This is due, in part, to the {{richness}} of their diets. In Yellowstone National Park in the United States, the grizzly bear's diet consists mostly of whitebark pine nuts, tubers, grasses, various rodents, army <b>cutworm</b> moths, and scavenged carcasses. [...] None of these, however, match the fat content of the salmon available in Alaska and British Columbia. With the high fat content of salmon, {{it is not uncommon}} to encounter grizzlies in Alaska weighing [...] Grizzlies in Alaska supplement their diet of salmon and clams with sedge grass and berries. In areas where salmon are forced to leap waterfalls, grizzlies gather at the base of the falls to feed on and catch the fish. Salmon are at a disadvantage when they leap waterfalls because they cluster together at their bases and are therefore easier targets for the grizzlies. Grizzly bears are well-documented catching leaping salmon in their mouths at Brooks Falls in Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska. They are also very experienced in chasing the fish around and pinning them with their claws. At such sites such as Brooks Falls and McNeil Falls in Alaska, big male grizzlies fight regularly for the best fishing spots. Grizzly bears along the coast also forage for razor clams, and frequently dig into the sand to seek them. During the spring and fall, directly before and after the salmon runs, berries and grass make up the mainstay of the diets of coastal grizzlies.|$|E

40|$|Black <b>cutworms</b> {{are usually}} {{associated}} with damage to corn. But this year, <b>cutworms</b> are causing significant stand loss in some soybean fields throughout central and southern Iowa.
