Such LLTs have recently attracted considerable attention {{mainly because of the}} fundamental interest in the physical origin of this counter-intuitive phenomenon. In this study, we report the first observation of wetting effects on LLT for a molecular liquid, triphenyl phosphite. We find a transition from partial to complete wetting for nucleation-growth-type LLT when approaching the spinodal temperature of LLT. Some features unique to LLT are also revealed, reflecting for example the non-conserved nature of its order parameter. We also find that the wetting behaviour is not induced by dispersion forces, but by weak hydrogen bonding to a solid substrate, implying its important role in the LLT itself. Using wetting effects may open a new possibility to <b>control</b> <b>kinetics</b> and spatial patterns of nucleation-growth-type LLT...|$|E

The diffusion coefficient for l-cystine hydrochloride was approximately 4. 8 × 10 ? 10 m 2 s? 1 from the three techniques.

The temperature dependent transformations of the kaolin was measure by means of fractional conversion of the ratios between AlO 6 :AlO 4 and Si-O-Al:Si-O-Si, which showed kobs values 0. 0168 s- 1 and 0. 0089 s- 1 for the transformation to the spinel phase and values of 0. 0165 s- 1 and 0. 0156 s- 1 for the transformation to mullite respectively. The pozzolanic activities of the kaolin calcined at different temperatures showed a maximum pozzolanic activity when the kaolin is calcined at 650 °C and the pozzolanic activity for mullite is even less than for the uncalcined kaolin. XPS revealed that the atomic ratio between Si and Al did not change from kaolin to metakaolin (Si:Al = ca. 1. 2) however the mullite showed a atomic ratio of Si:Al = 1. 52, implying that some deallumination occurred during calcination at high temperatures...|$|E

In this research, we have designed and fabricated a bilayer structure with a {{patterned surface}} which is capable of a dynamic on/off switching of a pattern responsive to the external compressive/tensile strain. A deformation map for describing the on/off switching of the void has been generated {{as a function of}} voids geometries (diameter, depth, density) and the applied strain. The critical strains have been determined for the extreme closure state of the void at a strain of 0. 4 - 0. 6. The dynamic deformation and possible local strain concentration have been investigated under fluorescence microscope and Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM). Furthermore, we characterize the corresponding changes in the static and dynamic contact angles.

The <b>control</b> <b>kinetics</b> will be discussed by considering the surface condition and system variables.

40|$|Ion {{irradiation}} {{has been}} investigated as a route for the preparation of mechanically stable and highly durable cross linked sulphonated PEEK for fuel cell application. The formation of cross linking was confirmed by solvent extraction using the well known Charlsby–Pinner equation. The DSC {{results indicated that the}} cross links retard the crystallization, but no changes were observed in the mechanism of crystallization. The thermal kinetic data for irradiated PEEK quantitatively suggest that these films still have sufficient thermal stability for long term applications as fuel cell membranes. Analysis of the dielectric response by Cole-Cole, Havrilak and Negami and Williams and Watts equations indicated that the dipole relaxation was broadened and becoming more asymmetric with cross link density. The sulphonation of the cross linked PEEK in concentrated sulphuric acid indicated that the rate of reaction decreased with cross linking density and was consistent with diffusion <b>control</b> <b>kinetics.</b> Increasing cross link density resulted in more bound water in the equilibrated membranes and the nano-structure present was comparable to that of Nafion. Cross linking improved the chemical stability of PEMs in particular in methanol solution. The measurement of power output and energy efficiency suggested that the cross linked PEMs produced are promising candidates to replace Nafion membranes but more information are required, in particular on their long term stability under fuel cell operating conditions.

40|$|Morphogenesis {{is central}} to biology but remains largely {{unexplored}} in chemistry. Reaction-diffusion (RD) mechanisms are, however, essential to understand how shape emerges in the living world. While numerical methods confirm the incredible potential of RD mechanisms to generate patterns, their experimental implementation, despite great efforts, has yet to surpass the paradigm of stationary Turing patterns achieved 25 years ago. The principal reason for our difficulty to synthesize arbitrary concentration patterns from scratch {{is the lack of}} fully programmable reaction-diffusion systems. To solve this problem we introduce here a DNA-based system where kinetics and diffusion can be individually tuned. We demonstrate the capability to precisely control reaction-diffusion properties with an autocatalytic network that propagates in a one-dimensional reactor with uniform velocity, typically 100 μm min- 1. The diffusion coefficient of the propagating species can be reduced up to a factor 2. 7 using a species-specific strategy relying on self-assembled hydrodynamic drags. Our approach is modular as we illustrate by designing three alternative front generating systems, two of which can pass through each other with little interaction. Importantly, the strategies to <b>control</b> <b>kinetics</b> and diffusion are orthogonal to each other resulting in simple programming rules. Our results can be quantitatively predicted from first-principle RD equations and are in excellent agreement with a generalized Fisher- Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscunov analytical model. Together, these advances open the way for the rational engineering of far-from-equilibrium arbitrary patterns and could lead to the synthesis of self-organizing materials...|$|E

While substantial {{progress has been made}} to delineate the developmental pathway of T-cell lineage commitment, still {{little is known about the}} relationship between differentiation competence and the remarkable expansion of the earliest (DN 1 stage) T-cell progenitors. To address this question, we developed computational models where the probability to progress to the next stage (DN 2) is related to division number. To satisfy differentiation kinetics and overall cell yield data, our models require that adult DN 1 cells divide multiple times before becoming competent to progress into DN 2 stage. Our findings were subsequently tested by in vitro experiments, where putative early and later-stage DN 1 progenitors from the thymus were purified and their progression into DN 2 was measured. These experiments showed that the two DN 1 sub-populations divided with similar rates, but progressed to the DN 2 stage with different rates, thus providing experimental evidence that DN 1 cells increase their commitment probability in a cell-intrinsic manner as they undergo cell division.

40|$|The {{inhibition}} of protein synthesis in hemedeficient reticulocyte lysates is reversed {{by the addition}} of hemin (20 microM) or MgGTP (2 mM). The rate of recovery is rapid and approaches <b>control</b> <b>kinetics</b> within a few minutes after the addition of either component. The restoration of protein synthesis is dependent upon the availability of functional reversing factor (RF). The fate of RF was monitored during recovery by using a method that measures RF activity in the lysate under physiological conditions. In the fully inhibited lysate, RF is sequestered in a nondissociable 15 S [RF. eIF- 2 (alpha P) ] complex (where eIF- 2 indicates eukaryotic initiation factor 2) in which RF activity is not functional and cannot be assayed. The first step in the rescue of protein synthesis in inhibited lysates by hemin or MgGTP is the {{inhibition of}} heme-regulated eIF- 2 alpha kinase, which enables endogenous phosphatase to dephosphorylate eIF- 2 (alpha P) and [RF. eIF- 2 (alpha P) ]. The release of approximately 50 % of the sequestered RF activity is sufficient to support optimal kinetics of recovery. Hemin and MgGTP both reverse inhibition by blocking the activation and/or activity of heme-regulated eIF- 2 alpha kinase in the lysate. The conclusion that MgGTP exerts its effect on eIF- 2 alpha kinase is supported by several in vitro findings: (i) 2 mM MgGTP inhibits the autophosphorylation of purified heme-regulated eIF- 2 alpha kinase and abolishes its ability to phosphorylate eIF- 2 alpha; (ii) 2 mM MgGTP cannot displace GDP in the binary complexes [eIF- 2.

40|$|Extracellular heat-shock {{proteins}} (eHsp) such {{as those}} belonging to the 70 -kDa family of Hsp (eg, Hsp 72) have been hypothesized {{to act as a}} “danger signal” to immune cells, promote immune responses, and improve host defense. The current study tested this hypothesis. Adult male F 344 rats were exposed to an acute laboratory stressor (100, 5 -second, 1. 6 -mA inescapable tail shocks) and challenged with Escherichia coli. The number of colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria at the site of injection, the levels of eHsp 72, the immune response to eHsp 72 and E coli–derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the amount of time required to recover from in vivo bacterial challenge were measured. CFUs were reduced 2, 4, and 6 hours after injection of E coli in rats exposed to stress. Rats exposed to stress had elevated eHsp 72 that was elevated rapidly (25 minutes) and remained elevated in the circulation and at the inflammatory site (2 hours after stressor termination). Both stressor exposure and eHsp 72 administration in the absence of stress resulted in a facilitated pattern of recovery after bacterial inflammation induced by subcutaneous E coli injection. Rats exposed to acute restraint (100 minutes) did not demonstrate elevated circulating eHsp 72 or a facilitated pattern of recovery after bacterial challenge. In vitro stimulation of rat splenocytes and macrophages with eHsp 72 elevated nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL) - 1 beta, and IL- 6, and this effect was specific to eHsp 72 because it was not diminished by polymyxin B and was reduced by earlier heat-denature treatment. Stimulation of cells with eHsp 72 combined with LPS resulted in a greater NO and cytokine response than that observed after stimulation with eHsp 72 or LPS alone. In vivo, at the inflammatory site, the bacterial-induced NO response was potentiated by stress, and NO inhibition (L-NIO) reduced the stress-induced facilitation but had no effect on the <b>control</b> <b>kinetics</b> of bacterial inflammation recovery. Thus, these results lend support to the hypothesis that intense stressor exposure increases eHsp 72, which acts as a danger signal to potentiate the NO response to bacterial challenge and facilitate recovery from bacterial inflammation...|$|E
