5|$|After {{crossing}} from East Lenox, PA106 <b>continues</b> southeastward through {{fields and}} soon into {{a region of}} residences. The southeastern stretch <b>continues</b> for several miles into the community of West Clifford. There, PA106 passes some homes and intersects with PA374. The two designations become concurrent, paralleling the alignment of the Milford and Owego Turnpike Road through West Clifford. PA106 and PA374 head southward and soon turn southwestward through forestry, until clearing into the community of Royal. In the small community, PA106 and PA374 fork, with PA374 heading southwestward to Glenwood and PA106 heading southeastward through Royal. PA106 <b>continues</b> further, entering deep woods once again after leaving Royal. At the intersection with Cemetery Road, the highway enters a large cemetery and into Clifford. There, the route crosses through a large residential and commercial community, intersecting with State Route2008 (SR2008). The route <b>continues</b> southeastward through the residential area before crossing the county line into Lackawanna County.|$|E

It <b>continues</b> fairly straight on a southeast course into Albany as Central Avenue until it reaches Townsend Park. At this point, NY5 turns into Washington Avenue and all signage referring to NY5 ceases.
