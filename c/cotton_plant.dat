25|$|Most cotton in the United States, Europe and Australia is {{harvested}} mechanically, {{either by}} a cotton picker, {{a machine that}} removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the <b>cotton</b> <b>plant,</b> or by a cotton stripper, which strips the entire boll off the plant. Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton, and usually after application of a chemical defoliant or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze. Cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics, and without defoliation or freezing, the plant will continue to grow.|$|E
25|$|Tangüis {{began to}} study some species of the plant that were {{affected}} by the disease {{to a lesser extent}} and experimented in germination with the seeds of various cotton plants. In 1911, after 10 years of experimenting and failures, Tangüis was able to develop a seed which produced a superior <b>cotton</b> <b>plant</b> resistant to the disease. The seeds produced a plant that had a 40% longer (between 29mm and 33mm) and thicker fiber that did not break easily and required little water. The cotton grown in Peru (Egyptian cotton) before the fungus plague grew only once a year; the Tangüis cotton grows six times a year. This type of fiber showed a better resistance and performance than other fibers.|$|E
25|$|The {{cottonseed}} {{which remains}} after the cotton is ginned {{is used to}} produce cottonseed oil, which, after refining, can be consumed by humans like any other vegetable oil. The cottonseed meal that is left generally is fed to ruminant livestock; the gossypol remaining in the meal is toxic to monogastric animals. Cottonseed hulls {{can be added to}} dairy cattle rations for roughage. During the American slavery period, cotton root bark was used in folk remedies as an abortifacient, that is, to induce a miscarriage. Gossypol was one of the many substances found {{in all parts of the}} <b>cotton</b> <b>plant</b> and it was described by the scientists as 'poisonous pigment'. It also appears to inhibit the development of sperm or even restrict the mobility of the sperm. Also, it is thought to interfere with the menstrual cycle by restricting the release of certain hormones.|$|E

40|$|The {{expression}} of two cotton osmotin genes was evaluated {{in terms of}} the mRNA and protein expression patterns in response to chemical inducers such as ethylene, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium chloride. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) indicated that osmotin mRNAs are expressed constitutively in root tissues of <b>cotton</b> <b>plants,</b> and that they are rapidly induced in leaf and stem tissues upon ethylene treatment. Real time RT-PCR indicated that osmotin transcript levels were induced 2 to 4 h after treatment with ethephon. The osmotin mRNA levels appear to increase 12 h after treatment, decrease, and then increase again. The osmotin protein expression patterns were analyzed in Western blot analyses using an anti-osmotin antibody preparation. A 24 -KDa protein band was detected from <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> treated with the inducers. The 24 -KDa osmotin proteins were induced 4 h after treatment with ethephon, while down-regulated 96 h after treatment. Multiple osmotin isoforms were observed to be induced in <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> upon treatment with ethephon by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. One goal of this dissertation research was to genetically engineer two cotton osmotin genes to routinely overproduce their antifungal proteins in transgenic Arabidopsis and <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> as a natural defense against fungal infections, using co-cultivation with Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells harboring pCAMBIA 2301 vector constructs containing the osmotin genes. Many transgenic Arabidopsis and <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> were generated. However, genomic blotting analyses indicated the absence of the osmotin transgenes, but the presence of GUS genes from the vector cassette. Alkaline blot analyses of the vector DNAs from transformed Agrobacterium cells confirmed that an anomalous DNA structural rearrangement or aberrant recombination event probably occurred in the Agrobacterium cells, interdicting the integration of osmotin transgenes into the Arabidopsis and <b>cotton</b> <b>plants.</b> This research provides crucial baseline information on {{expression of}} cotton osmotin mRNAs and proteins...|$|R
40|$|The host {{acceptance}} of neonate Alabama argillacea (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) larvae to Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> exerts {{a strong influence}} on the potential risk that this pest will develop resistance to Bt cotton. This will also determine the efficiency of management strategies to prevent its resistance such as the "refuge-in-the-bag" strategy. In this study, we assessed the {{acceptance of}} neonate A. argillacea larvae to Bt and non-Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> at different temperatures during the first 24 h after hatching. Two cotton cultivars {{were used in the}} study, one a Bt DP 404 BG (Bollgard) cultivar, and the other, an untransformed isoline, DP 4049 cultivar. There was a greater acceptance by live neonate A. argillacea larvae for the non-Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> compared with the Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>plants,</b> especially in the time interval between 18 and 24 h. The percentages of neonate A. argillacea larvae found on Bt or non-Bt plants were lower when exposed to temperatures of 31 and 34 °C. The low acceptance of A. argillacea larvae for Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> at high temperatures stimulated the dispersion of A. argillacea larvae. Our results support the hypothesis that the dispersion and/or feeding behavior of neonate A. argillacea larvae is different between Bt and non-Bt cotton. The presence of the Cry 1 Ac toxin in Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>plants,</b> and its probable detection by the A. argillacea larvae tasting or eating it, increases the probability of dispersion from the plant where the larvae began. These findings may help to understand how the A. argillacea larvae detect the Cry 1 Ac toxin in Bt cotton and how the toxin affects the dispersion behavior of the larvae over time. Therefore, our results are extremely important for the management of resistance in populations of A. argillacea on Bt cotton...|$|R

40|$|Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), {{the major}} target pest of {{transgenic}} Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton, remains susceptible to Bt cotton in China at present. Behavioural avoidance by ovipositing females {{might lead to}} reduced exposure to Bt cotton and minimize selection for physiological resistance. We examined the behavioural responses of H. armigera to Bt and non-Bt cottons to determine whether behavioural avoidance to Bt cotton may be present. In oviposition choice tests, the number of eggs on non-Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> {{was significantly higher than}} on Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>plants.</b> Similarly, in no-choice tests, Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> attracted significantly fewer eggs compared with non-Bt <b>cotton</b> <b>plants.</b> H. armigera neonates showed higher dispersal and lower establishment on Bt cotton than on non-Bt cotton. First instars were found to feed consistently on non-Bt cotton leaves, creating large feeding holes, but only produced tiny feeding holes on Bt cotton leaves. The H. armigera population used in this study showed avoidance of oviposition and feeding on Bt cotton. Our results provide important insights into one possible mechanism underlying the durability of Bt cotton resistance and may be useful for improving strategies to sustain the effectiveness of Bt crops...|$|R

In this study, the effects of Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) on aphid population density were investigated on Bt-cotton; the combinational impacts of nitrogen and potassium (K) fertilizers {{on the distribution of}} aphid were examined as to guide rational fertilization to reduce pests and environmental pollution. Aphid density in <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> fertilized with 72 kg/ha N (84. 2 ± 22. 7 aphids/plant) was significantly higher than fertilized with 0 and 108 kg/ha N (36. 7 ± 4. 0 and 47. 8 ± 18. 7 aphids/plant). Compared to <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> treated with 23 and 69 kg/ha P, aphid density was higher (61. 67 ± 21. 08 aphids/plant) in <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> treated with 46 kg/ha P. Comparison of spatial distribution of aphid population showed that aphid preferred to suck the sap of bottom fruit branches in <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> treated by single K fertilizer and combinational fertilizers of N and K.

40|$|Abstract—Agriculture is the {{backbone}} of economy of Pakistan and cotton is the major agricultural export and supreme source of raw fiber for our textile industry. To combat severe problems of insect and weed, combination of three genes namely Cry 1 Ac, Cry 2 A and EPSPS genes was transferred in locally cultivated cotton variety MNH- 786 {{with the use of}} Agrobacterium mediated genetic transformation. The present study focused on the molecular screening of transgenic <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> at T 3 generation in order to confirm integration and expression of all three genes (Cry 1 Ac, Cry 2 A and EPSP synthase) into the cotton genome. Initially, glyphosate spray assay was used for screening of transgenic <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> containing EPSP synthase gene at T 3 generation. Transgenic <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> which were healthy and showed no damage on leaves were selected after 07 days of spray. For molecular analysis of transgenic <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> in the laboratory, the genomic DNA of these transgenic <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> were isolated and subjected to amplification of the three genes. Thus, seventeen out of twenty (Cry 1 Ac gene), ten out of twenty (Cry 2 A gene) and all twenty (EPSP synthase gene) were produced positive amplification. On the base of PCR amplification, ten transgenic plant samples were subjected to protein expression analysis through ELISA. The results showed that eight out of ten plants were actively expressing the three transgenes. Real-time PCR was also done to quantify the mRNA expression levels of Cry 1 Ac and EPSP synthase gene. Finally, eight plants were confirmed for the presence and active expression of all three genes at T 3 generation...|$|R
