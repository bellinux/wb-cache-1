5|$|Friendly {{generally}} {{approved of}} the first version but {{believed that it was}} necessary to include information on same-sex sexual practices. When those practices were explained to him, however, he changed his mind. While the documentary was still in production, Friendly was promoted to the presidency of <b>CBS</b> <b>News</b> but left soon after over a disagreement over the network's coverage of the Vietnam War. He was replaced by Richard S. Salant, who was known for his cost-consciousness, which put the future of the documentary and the CBS Reports series in question.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, a <b>CBS</b> <b>News</b> / New York Times poll {{reported}} that 47% of Americans approved {{the health care}} law.

5|$|With {{a budget}} of $230,000, the {{surviving}} original lunar broadcast data from Apollo 11 was compiled by Nafzger and assigned to Lowry Digital for restoration.

Wolper's documentaries. After being laid off he met producer Allan Burns who secured him a job as a writer on the series My Mother the Car.|$|E
5|$|Aubrey fought {{constantly}} {{with officials}} of <b>CBS</b> <b>News,</b> especially its chief, Fred W. Friendly, {{who was just}} as demanding and controlling as Aubrey. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and in his memoir, Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control, recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey talked at length of how much money the news was costing the company, a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. However, Paley supported the news and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. Aubrey in 1962 ordered {{that there would be}} fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition. Friendly resented this move.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the IMA hosted The William S. Paley Collection, a {{traveling}} exhibition {{organized by the}} Museum of Modern Art that included Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, and modern pieces collected by the late <b>CBS</b> <b>news</b> chairman William S. Paley. The exhibit helped establish the IMA as a prominent museum venue in the Midwest and brought in a record-setting 60,837 visitors. In 2001, the IMA collaborated with the Armory Museum in Moscow to organize Gifts to the Tsars, 1500–1700: Treasures from the Kremlin. The show helped the IMA form partnerships with local arts organizations, gain international exposure, and attracted a record 70,704 visitors. Another important exhibit {{to travel to the}} IMA was Roman Art from the Louvre, which attracted 106,002 visitors during its 2008 run. The exhibition featured 184 mosaics, frescoes, statues, marble reliefs, and vessels loaned from the permanent collection of the Louvre in Paris, France. It was the largest collection ever loaned from the Louvre to date, and only stopped in three U.S. cities before returning to France.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{made several}} changes from Gerolmo's {{original}} draft. He omitted the Mafia hitman {{and created the}} character Agent Monk, a black FBI specialist who kidnaps Tilman. The scene in which Frank Bailey brutally beats a news cameraman {{was based on an}} actual event; Parker and Colesberry were inspired by a news outtake found during their research, in which a <b>CBS</b> <b>News</b> cameraman was assaulted by a suspect in the 1964 murder case. Parker also wrote a sex scene involving Rupert Anderson and Mrs. Pell. The scene was omitted during filming after Gene Hackman, who portrays Anderson, suggested to Parker that {{the relationship between the two}} characters be more discreet. By January 4, 1988, Parker had written a complete shooting script, which he submitted to Orion executives. Gerolmo did not visit the production during principal photography, due to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike.|$|E
5|$|Revelations from {{software}} {{produced by}} Virgil Griffith in 2007 called WikiScanner made public {{the nature of}} edits on Wikipedia which were able to be traced directly back to Church of Scientology-controlled computers. <b>CBS</b> <b>News</b> and The Independent reported that edits by the Church of Scientology were made in attempts to remove criticism from the main article on the topic. The Times and Forbes noted that Scientologist computers were used to remove links between the Church of Scientology and a former anti-cult organization, since taken over by Scientology, the Cult Awareness Network. Der Spiegel reported that Wikiscanner revealed Scientology computers were used to promote Scientology's critical view of psychiatry, including adding links to the Scientology-founded Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) and to websites of other groups affiliated with Scientology.|$|E
5|$|The storm struck Florida in {{the midst}} of 1992 presidential {{election}} campaign. A poll conducted by <b>CBS</b> <b>News</b> in September showed that 65% of Dade County residents approved of Bush's handling of the disaster, while 61% of residents approved statewide. Despite the support of Bush's response and his proposal to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base, he benefited little politically and trailed 48%–42% against Bill Clinton in another poll taken in September. Additionally, 75% of voters in Dade County and 82% of Floridians overall stated that the president's actions in response to Andrew would not impact their vote in November. Bush went on to carry the state of Florida, but by a margin of only 1.89%. The hurricane also impacted Governor Chiles politically. The state's response to the storm was perceived as poor, sinking Chiles' approval rating to 22%, while his disapproval rating rose to 76%. However, Chiles was able to recover prior to the 1994 gubernatorial election.|$|E

5|$|David Kaczynski {{had once}} admired and {{emulated}} his older brother, but had later {{decided to leave}} the survivalist lifestyle behind. He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to <b>CBS</b> <b>News</b> in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records. At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking how they felt about going to the same high school the Unabomber had attended. That night the news story was released to public.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditionally}} strong journalistic bench of <b>CBS</b> <b>News</b> {{was changed}} in 1984 when new owner Lawrence Tisch oversaw layoffs {{of thousands of}} <b>CBS</b> <b>News</b> employees, including correspondents David Andelman, Fred Graham, Morton Dean and Ike Pappas.
