40|$|Lime {{has been}} {{extensively}} used to improve the strength of fine-grained soils. It has recently been reported {{that the presence of}} sulphate in soils causes abnormal volume changes in lime stabilised soil. This paper presents the strength behaviour of lime-treated kaolinitic natural red earth in the presence of varying sulphate contents, up to 3, after <b>curing</b> <b>for</b> periods of up to 365 days. Alteration of soil-lime reactions in the presence of sulphate leads to the formation of ettringite after <b>curing</b> <b>for</b> longer periods. The formation of these compounds affects strength development by cementation. However, after <b>curing</b> <b>for</b> short periods, the strength of lime-treated soil is improved in the presence of sulphate. It is only after <b>curing</b> <b>for</b> longer periods that the strength is decreased. Consequently the stress-strain behaviour and effective stress paths of treated soil <b>cured</b> <b>for</b> long periods show the behaviour of a normally consolidated soil rather than of cemented soils. The reduction in strength is due primarily to a reduction in the effective cohesion intercept. The effective friction angle has not been affected significantly. Â© 2006 Thomas Telford Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. Four {{commercial}} glass-ionomer cements {{have been}} studied {{for their ability to}} take up fluoride from aqueous solution following variable maturation times in the dry at 37 ◦C. Methods. Sets of five specimens of four different materials were <b>cured</b> <b>for</b> times of 10 min, 24 h and 1 month, then transferred to a neutral solution of NaF at approximately 1000 ppm in fluoride. Fluoride concentration was then measured at regular time intervals up to 1 month using a fluoride ion selective electrode. Results. Specimens <b>cured</b> <b>for</b> 1 month showed little or no uptake over 24 h, specimens <b>cured</b> <b>for</b> 24 h showed fluctuating uptake over time, and specimens <b>cured</b> <b>for</b> 10 min showed the greatest fluoride uptake. For the latter specimens, simple kinetic models were found to apply in two cases (pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order for Chemflex and Ketac Molar Quick respectively). Significance. The ability to take up fluoride has been shown to decline with age of cement which suggests that in clinical use glass-ionomers may become less effective at undergoing fluoride recharge than has been previously assumed...|$|R
