40|$|Abstract. <b>Colour</b> <b>transfer</b> {{algorithms}} aim {{to apply}} a colour palette, mood or style from one image to another, operating either in a threedimensional colour space, or splitting the problem into three simpler one-dimensional problems. The latter class of algorithms simply treats {{each of the three}} dimensions independently, whether justified or not. Although they rarely introduce spatial artefacts, the quality of the results depends on how the problem was split into three sub-problems, i. e. which colour space was chosen. Generally, the assumption is made that a decorrelated colour space would perform best, as decorrelation makes the three colour channels semi-independent (decorrelation is a weaker property than independence). However, such spaces are only decorrelated for well-chosen image ensembles. For individual images, this property may not hold. In this work, the connection between the natural statistics of colour images and the ability of existing <b>colour</b> <b>transfer</b> algorithms to produce plausible results is investigated. This work aims to provide {{a better understanding of the}} performance of different colour spaces in the context of <b>colour</b> <b>transfer...</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of colour mapping or <b>colour</b> <b>transfer</b> methods is to recolour a given image or video by deriving a mapping between that image and another image {{serving as a}} reference. These methods have received considerable attention in recent years, both in academic literature and industrial applications. Methods for recolouring images have often appeared under the labels of colour correction, <b>colour</b> <b>transfer</b> or colour balancing, to name a few, but their goal is always the same: mapping the colours of one image to another. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of these methods and offer a classification of current solutions depending not only on their algorithmic formulation but also their range of applications. We also provide a new dataset and a novel evaluation technique called ‘evaluation by colour mapping roundtrip’. We discuss the relative merit of each class of techniques through examples and show how colour mapping solutions can have been applied to a diverse range of problems...|$|E

40|$|People {{tracking}} using {{colour feature}} in crowded scene through CCTV network {{have been a}} popular {{and at the same}} time a very difficult topic in computer vision. It is mainly because of the difficulty for the acquisition of intrinsic signatures of targets from a single view of the scene. Many factors, such as variable illumination conditions and viewing angles, will induce illusive modification of intrinsic signatures of targets. The objective of this paper is to verify if colour constancy (CC) approach really helps people tracking in CCTV network system. We have testified a number of CC algorithms together with various colour descriptors, to assess the efficiencies of people recognitions from real multi-camera i-LIDS data set via Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC). It is found that when CC is applied together with some form of colour restoration mechanisms such as <b>colour</b> <b>transfer,</b> the recognition performance can be improved by at least a factor of two.

This crystallisation step was necessary for colour studies, since it is well established that the <b>colour</b> <b>transfer</b> from liquor to crystalis influenced {{by the nature of the}} colourant. Industrial liquors from refineries using different decolourisationprocesses wereboiled under standard conditions in the SugarMilling Research Institute pilot pan. The results showed significant differences in the colours of the affinated crystals obtained, and a clearindication ofhigher <b>colour</b> <b>transfer</b> from the non-sulphitation liquors. When a given liquor was treated by sulphitation or ion exchange in the laboratory,sulphitation removed 35 % ofthe colourfrom the liquor whereas resin removed 60 %. Aftercrystallisation, however, the crystalcolourfrom the resin-treatedliquor was only marginally lowerthan that of the sulphited hquor. Under strictly comparable conditions, colourtransferfromresintreated liquors was about 20 % higher than that from sulphitation liquors. It is shownthat a combination of the resin and sulphitation processes offers possibilities ofreducing the cost of achieving the required crystal colour...|$|E
40|$|In vector graphics, {{gradient}} meshes {{represent an}} image object {{by one or}} more regularly connected grids. Every grid point has attributes as the position, colour and gradients of these quantities specified. Editing the attributes of an existing gradient mesh (such as the colour gradients) is not only non-intuitive but also time-consuming. To facilitate user-friendly colour editing, we develop an optimization-based <b>colour</b> <b>transfer</b> method for gradient meshes. The key idea is built on the fact that we can approximate a <b>colour</b> <b>transfer</b> operation on gradient meshes with a linear transfer function. In this paper, we formulate the approximation as an optimization problem, which aims to minimize the colour distribution of the example image and the transferred gradient mesh. By adding proper constraints, i. e. image gradients, to the optimization problem, the details of the gradient meshes can be better preserved. With the linear transfer function, we are able to edit the colours and colour gradients of the mesh points automatically, while preserving the structure of the gradient mesh. The experimental results show that our method can generate pleasing recoloured gradient meshes...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{study of}} heavy quark {{production}} in lepton-proton scattering provides an important testing {{ground for the}} standard model. At the electron-proton collider HERA with an e Γ p centre-of-mass energy p s = 300 GeV, heavy quarks are produced predominantly by the photon gluon fusion process flg ! c¯c; where a real or virtual photon emitted by the electron a and a gluon from the proton generate a c¯c pair. In this case <b>colour</b> is <b>transferred</b> from the proton so that the proton breaks up (inelastic scattering). In general, also elastic scattering may occur where no <b>colour</b> is <b>transferred</b> and the proton can remain intact (diffractive interactions). The dominant contribution to charm production is due to exchange of an almost real photon (photoproduction), where the negative squared...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{flexible}} approach to <b>colour</b> <b>transfer</b> inspired by techniques recently proposed for shape registration. Colour distributions of the palette and target images are modelled with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) that are robustly registered to infer a non linear parametric transfer function. We show experimentally that our approach compares well to current techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, our technique is computationally the fastest {{and can take}} efficient advantage of parallel processing architectures for recolouring images and videos. Our transfer function is parametric and hence {{can be stored in}} memory for later usage and also combined with other computed transfer functions to create interesting visual effects. Overall this paper provides a fast user friendly approach to recolouring of image and video materials...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} automatically eliminating unwanted colour variation between similar image pairs. We propose a feature-based registration method to align colour histograms without any spatial processing of the image content or assumptions about the scene contents. We use the method for the <b>colour</b> <b>transfer</b> problem. The features are histogram maxima that persist through the scale space, so they are robust to large changes in the sizes of objects in the scene. The algorithm seeks the best matches between features and aligns the histograms via a polynomial warp. We construct a set of image pairs that exhibit variation in object scale and lighting {{and use it to}} show that the method produces better colour space alignments than simple alignments of histogram moments. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{enormous}} {{changes in}} flexography printing {{in recent years}} concerning the printing quality achievable cannot generally be ascribed to a single revolutionary invention, but {{are the result of}} continuous developments to the complete system. Thus the direct drive technology in all machine types and its associated advantages in terms of printing length corrections has become established since drupa 2000. The race for ever finer raster rolls has also been completed to the benefit of improvements in bowl geometry and in ceramic surfaces. Clearly improved <b>colour</b> <b>transfer</b> behaviour has become feasible as a result. In a closely intermeshed system such as flexography printing this naturally has to {{have an effect on the}} printing colours used. Further improvements in bonding agents and pigment concentrations now allow users to print ever thinner colour layers while maintaining all of the required authenticities. Furthermore, it has become possible to reduce additional disturbing characteristics in the UV colour area, such as the unpleasant odour. While the digital imaging of printing plates has primarily been improved in terms of economic efficiency by the use of up to eight parallel laser beams, extreme improvements in the system are noticeable especially in the area of directly engraved printing moulds. Whereas many still dismissed directly engraved polymer plates at the last drupa as a laboratory system, the first installation was recently placed on the market a mere three years later. A further noteworthy innovation of recent years that has reached market maturity is thin sleeve technology, which combines the advantages of a photopolymer plate with a round imaged printing mould. There are no high sleeve costs for each printing mould, except for one-off cost for an adapter sleeve. To conclude, it can be said that although flexography printing has experienced many new features in the time between drupa 2000 and today, it still has enormous potential for further development...|$|E
