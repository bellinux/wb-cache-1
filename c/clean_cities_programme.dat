40|$|This {{fact sheet}} {{provides}} an overview of the U. S. Department of Energy's <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> program, which builds partnerships to reduce petroleum use in transportation in communities across the country. The U. S. Department of Energy's <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> initiative advances the nation's economic, environmental, and energy security by supporting local actions to reduce petroleum consumption in transportation. <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> accomplishes this work through the activities of nearly 100 local coalitions. These coalitions provide resources and technical assistance in the deployment of alternative and renewable fuels, idle-reduction measures, fuel economy improvements, and new transportation technologies, as they emerge. <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> overarching goal is to reduce U. S. petroleum use by 2. 5 billion gallons per year by 2020. To achieve this goal, <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> employs three strategies: (1) Replace petroleum with alternative and renewable fuels, including natural gas, propane, electricity, ethanol, biodiesel, and hydrogen; (2) Reduce petroleum consumption through smarter driving practices and fuel economy improvements; and (3) Eliminate petroleum use through idle reduction and other fuel-saving technologies and practices...|$|R
40|$|<b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> is a government-industry {{partnership}} {{sponsored by}} the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Vehicle Technologies Program, {{which is part of}} the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Working with its network of about 100 local coalitions and more than 6, 500 stakeholders across the country, <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> delivers on its mission to reduce petroleum consumption in on-road transportation. In its work to reduce petroleum use, <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> focuses on a portfolio of technologies that includes electric drive, propane, natural gas, renewable natural gas/biomethane, ethanol/E 85, biodiesel/B 20 and higher-level blends, fuel economy, and idle reduction. Over the past 17 years, <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> coalitions have displaced more than 2. 4 billion gallons of petroleum; they are on track to displace 2. 5 billion gallons of gasoline per year by 2020. This <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> Strategic Plan lays out an aggressive five-year agenda to help DOE <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> and its network of coalitions and stakeholders accelerate the deployment of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles, while also expanding the supporting infrastructure to reduce petroleum use. Today, <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> has a far larger opportunity to make an impact than at any time in its history because of its unprecedented $ 300 million allocation for community-based deployment projects from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) (see box below). Moreover, the <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> annual budget has risen to $ 25 million for FY 2010 and $ 35 million has been requested for FY 2011. Designed as a living document, this strategic plan is grounded in the understanding that priorities will change annually as evolving technical, political, economic, business, and social considerations are woven into project decisions and funding allocations. The plan does not intend to lock <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> into pathways that cannot change. Instead, with technology deployment at its core, the plan serves as a guide for decision-making at both the national and local levels of <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> over the next five years. The plan recognizes the need for flexibility and sets out a strategic direction that will build on the progress of current technologies and new opportunities presented in emerging fuels and technologies, such as hydrogen and fuel cells, as well as new niche markets such as off-road applications that build additional throughput at existing alternative fuel stations...|$|R

Established in 1993 {{in response to the}} Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, the partnership provides tools and resources for voluntary, community-centered programs to reduce consumption of petroleum-based fuels. In nearly 100 coalitions, government agencies and private companies voluntarily come together under the umbrella of <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities.</b> The partnership helps all parties identify mutual interests and meet the objectives of reducing the use of petroleum, developing regional economic opportunities, and improving air quality. <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> deploys technologies and practices developed by VTP. These include idle-reduction equipment, electric-drive vehicles, fuel economy measures, and renewable and alternative fuels, such as natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (propane), electricity, hydrogen, biofuels, and biogas. Idle-reduction equipment is targeted primarily to buses and heavy-duty trucks, which use more than 2 billion gallons of fuel every year in the United States while idling. <b>Clean</b> <b>Cities</b> fuel economy measures include public education on vehicle choice and fuel-efficient driving practices...|$|R
