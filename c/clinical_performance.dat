40|$|Regulators and {{healthcare}} payers are increasingly demanding evidence that biomarkers deliver patient benefits {{to justify their}} use in clinical practice. Laboratory professionals need {{to be familiar with}} these evidence requirements to better engage in biomarker research and decisions about their appropriate use. This paper by a multidisciplinary group of the European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine describes the pathway of a laboratory assay measuring a biomarker to becoming a medically useful test. We define the key terms, principles and components of the test evaluation process. Unlike previously described linearly staged models, we illustrate how the essential components of analytical and <b>clinical</b> <b>performances,</b> <b>clinical</b> and cost-effectiveness and the broader impact of testing assemble in a dynamic cycle. We highlight the importance of defining clinical goals and how the intended application of the biomarker in the clinical pathway should drive each component of test evaluation. This approach emphasizes the interaction of the different components, and that clinical effectiveness data should be fed back to refine analytical and <b>clinical</b> <b>performances</b> to achieve improved outcomes. The framework aims to support the understanding of key stakeholders. The laboratory profession needs to strengthen collaboration with industry and experts in evidence-based medicine, regulatory bodies and policy makers for better decisions about the use of new and existing medical test...|$|R

25|$|In 1998, {{silicone}} hydrogels became available. These {{materials have}} both the extremely high oxygen permeability of silicone and the comfort and <b>clinical</b> <b>performance</b> {{of the conventional}} hydrogels. Because silicone allows more oxygen permeability than water, oxygen permeability of silicone hydrogels is not tied to the lenses' water content. Lenses have now been developed with so much oxygen permeability that they are approved for overnight wear (extended wear). Lenses approved for daily wear are also available in silicone hydrogel materials.|$|E
25|$|When {{currently}} available implants are used, cemented stems {{tend to have}} a better longevity than uncemented stems. No significant difference is observed in the <b>clinical</b> <b>performance</b> of the various methods of surface treatment of uncemented devices. Uncemented stems are selected for patients with good quality bone that can resist the forces needed to drive the stem in tightly. Cemented devices are typically selected for patients with poor quality bone who are at risk of fracture during stem insertion. Cemented stems are less expensive due to lower manufacturing cost, but require good surgical technique to place them correctly. Uncemented stems can cause pain with activity in up to 20% of patients during the first year after placement as the bone adapts to the device. This is rarely seen with cemented stems.|$|E
25|$|India {{dominated}} {{the rest of}} the Group stage with 2 one-sided victories against Zimbabwe at Bombay and Ahmedabad, followed by wins against Australia and New Zealand at New Delhi and Nagpur respectively. India dished out a <b>clinical</b> <b>performance</b> against the Aussies, with 4 Indian batsmen: Gavaskar (61 from 72 balls, 7 fours), Sidhu (51 from 70 balls, 2 fours), Vengsarkar (63 from 60 balls, 3 fours and 2 sixes) and Azharuddin (54 not out from 45 balls, 5 fours and 1 six): scoring half-centuries as India posted an imposing 289/6. Maninder (3/34) and Azharuddin (3/19) then contributed with the ball as Australia crashed to 233 all out in the 49th over. India's last match in the Group stage against New Zealand was noted as the match in which Gavaskar scored his first and only ODI century (103 not out from 88 balls, 10 fours and 3 sixes). Supported by Srikkanth (75 from 58 balls, 9 fours and 3 sixes), Gavaskar toyed with the New Zealand bowling attack with an attacking innings uncharacteristic of his typical dour and rock-like approach as India chased down New Zealand's modest score of 221/9 with the loss of only Srikkanth's wicket and 18 overs to spare. Gavaskar and Srikkanth added 136 runs for the 2nd wicket. Also notable in this match was Chetan Sharma's hat-trick, the first ever both by an Indian bowler and in the World Cup. His hat-trick involved the wickets of Ken Rutherford, wicketkeeper Ian Smith and tailender Ewen Chatfield. Sharma finished with figures of 3/51. With 5 wins and 1 loss from 6 matches, India topped their group and qualified for the semifinals, where they were to play England at Bombay.|$|E

40|$|Summary: We {{evaluated}} the <b>clinical</b> <b>performances</b> of the immunoenzymometric assays for type I collagen N-terminal and C-terminal telopeptides and the HPLC assay for total deoxypyridinoline, in distinguishing between subjects with a moderately increased bone resorption rate (women in postmenopause) and subjects with normal bone resorption rate (women in premenopause). The postmenopausal {{group consisted of}} 61 {{women who had been}} in menopause for no more than 10 years, while the premenopausal group consisted of 52 healthy women with normal menstrual cycles. The biochemical markers were measured in a 24 hour urine sample and the results expressed as the molar ratio with urinary creatinine. The <b>clinical</b> <b>performances</b> were estimated by calculating the accuracy (as the area under a Receiver Operated Characteristic (ROC) curve: mean ± SEM) and the discriminating power (as score) of each assay in distinguishing postmenopausal subjects from premenopausal subjects. Type I collagen C-terminal telopeptide, type I collagen N-terminal telopeptide and total deoxypyridinoline were signifi-cantly higher in the postmenopausal than in the premenopausal group (p < 0. 001). Accuracies of these three markers ranged from 66. 8 ± 5. 1 % to 76. 8 ± 4. 3 %, while Z scores ranged from 3. 54 to 5. 67. Type I collagen C-terminal telopeptide, type I collagen N-terminal telopeptide and total deoxypyridinoline were not significantly different in their accuracy or discriminating power. All markers were highly correlated with coefficients of correlation ranging from 0. 61 to 0. 77...|$|R

40|$|Background The authors {{evaluated}} <b>clinical</b> <b>performances</b> of a packable and {{a conventional}} hybrid resin-based composite {{used with a}} self-etch adhesive system. Methods Three dentists placed 105 posterior restorations in 65 adults. They placed a packable (SureFil, Dentsply DeTrey GmbH, Konstanz, Germany) and a conventional (SpectrumTPH, Dentsply DeTrey GmbH) resin-based composite using a self-etch resin adhesive system. The authors evaluated the restorations using Ryge modified criteria, photographs and die stone replicas. Results After 3. 5 years, six large SureFil and two SpectrumTPH restorations had failed from bulk fracture and secondary caries, resulting in cumulative survival rates of 81. 3 and 92. 0 percent, respectively. Failed SureFil restorations generally were larger than the remaining intact restorations. Other ratings were satisfactory, with {{no significant differences between}} the two materials for any restoration parameter. Alfa ratings for both materials were approximately 80 percent or greater for marginal discoloration, anatomical form, surface texture and surface staining. Lower percentages of restorations were rated Alfa for color match, marginal integrity and gingival health. No postoperative sensitivity was reported. Net mean occlusal wear (± standard deviation) was 28. 9 (± 32. 9) micrometers for SureFil and 33. 8 (± 29. 6) μm for SpectrumTPH restorations; the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions When used with a self-etch adhesive, the 3. 5 -year <b>clinical</b> <b>performances</b> of both composites were similar and satisfactory for the restoration of Class I and moderate-sized Class II cavities. Clinical Implications The two composites placed in this study have an increased risk of bulk fracture when placed in large intracoronal Class II molar preparations. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Lateralized post-chiasmatic lesions to {{the primary}} visual pathway result in loss of vision over the visual field retinotopically {{corresponding}} {{to the site of}} the lesion. Previous studies showed that a systematic audio-visual training could constitute an efficient tool for the rehabilitation of such disturbances as revealed by ameliorated <b>clinical</b> <b>performances</b> in various visual domains. The first part of the present dissertation aim to shed light on the substrates underlying multisensory mediated recovery of visual field defects. Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, demonstrated that a sustained audio-visual training can promote stable plastic neural changes within the cortex, likely reflecting an enhanced activity of those neural circuits connecting superior colliculus to cortical areas within the dorsal stream. The second part of the present dissertation aimed to shed light on the functionality and the characteristics of extrageniculate circuits targeting extrastriate visual areas within the dorsal stream. Experiment 3 and Experiment 4, suggested that these connections remain responsive even when a lesion prevents visual processing within the primary visual channel and that these connections could play a relevant role in the rapid processing of salient visual stimuli. Overall, the present experimental evidence suggest that visual processing depends on a variety of neural circuits and that a lesion {{to the primary}} visual pathway do not abolish the visual processing mediated by alternative routes. Moreover, activity within these routes could be exploited in a rehabilitative perspective, as revealed by ameliorated <b>clinical</b> <b>performances</b> and stable plastic neural changes induced by a systematic multisensory audio-visual training in hemianopic patients...|$|R
