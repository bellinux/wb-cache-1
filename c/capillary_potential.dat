He called this the <b>capillary</b> <b>potential,</b> this is now known as the moisture or water potential (matric potential). He combined capillary theory and an energy potential in soil physics theory, and was the first to expound the dependence of soil hydraulic conductivity on <b>capillary</b> <b>potential.</b> This dependence later {{came to be known as}} relative permeability in petroleum engineering. He also applied a formula equivalent to Darcy's law to unsaturated flow.|$|E
5000|$|One of his key {{interests}} was {{the energy}} status of soil water, and {{he led the}} way in developing new and improved methods of measuring soil water potential. Early in his career, Richards recognised the importance of <b>capillary</b> <b>potential</b> to plant-soil relations, and described the principles, construction and operation of the tensiometer. Richards also proposed the tension plate apparatus for determining <b>capillary</b> <b>potential</b> in soil. The tensiometer was developed from the idea of using a semi-permeable, porous ceramic material to balance a pressure potential against a matric potential; once equilibrium had established, the matric potential of the soil could be determined by balancing the pressure potential.|$|E

Without sufficient leaching, salts applied with the irrigation water may build up in the root zone, usually {{at the edge of}} the wetting pattern.

40|$|Although {{fractures}} in rock are well-recognized as pathways for fast percolation of water, {{the possibility that}} fast flow could occur along unsaturated fracture pathways is commonly not considered in vadose zone hydrology. In this study, two mechanisms for fast flow along unsaturated fractures were investigated, film flow and surface zone flow. The importance of fracture surface roughness was demonstrated through experiments conducted on ceramic blocks having simple surface topographies. Those experiments showed that film flow on fracture surfaces {{is largely due to}} flow along continuous surface channels which become water-filled at near-zero matric (<b>capillary)</b> <b>potentials.</b> The second mechanism, surface zone flow, is important when the permeability of the rock along fractures (fracture skin) is significantly greater than that of the bulk rock matrix. Surface zone fast flow was demonstrated through water imbibition (sorptivity) experiments. These mechanisms help explain observations of rapid solute transport in unsaturated subsurface environments...|$|R

40|$|Downloaded Fto {{the present}} {{research}} are passive capillary-driven phase change devices @ 1 #. In these devices, the phase change occurs in a liquid-saturated porous or grooved media where capillary forces provide the driving potential for the liquid flow from the condenser to the evaporator. Ultimately for low temperature devices, {{the rate at which}} the condenser can re-supply liquid to the evaporator limits the heat transport. In practice, however, this capillary heat trans-port limitation is rarely achieved @ 2 #. One possible explanation is that design predictions over-predict the wetting characteristics since they are based on a ‘maximum <b>capillary</b> <b>potential</b> ’ which presumes that the liquid within the porous structure is perfectly wetting and static conditions exist at the evaporating menisci. Dy-namic effects, other than those due to viscous flow losses, are not considered. The speculation here is that the dynamics associated with fluid motion and heat transport in the vicinity of the evaporating me-niscus can detrimentally affect the driving <b>capillary</b> <b>potential</b> by degrading the wetting ability of the working fluid @ 3, 4 #. The change in wetability is the result of non-isothermal liquid-vapor interfacial temperatures near the contact line arising from both non-uniform substrate wall temperatures and non-uniform evapo-ration. Either or both of these influences yield surface tension gradients on the liquid-vapor interface, with positive slope toward a cooler region of the interface. For example, if the pore wall is heated, the relatively cooler pore center region, with higher sur-ment or spreading of an evaporating drop is retarded due to the evaporation process. Sen and Davis @ 7 # showed that, for a slot configuration, surface tension gradients create a fluid surface flow field, which also affects the liquid wetability. Anderson and Davis @ 8 # analytically demonstrated that the flow field was coupled to the temperature field through the thermocapillarity as discussed b...|$|E

40|$|Moisture-harvesting lizards, {{such as the}} Texas horned lizard Phrynosoma cornutum, have {{remarkable}} adaptations for inhabiting arid regions. Special skin structures, {{in particular}} capillary channels in between imbricate overlapping scales, enable the lizard to collect water by capillarity and to transport it to the snout for ingestion. This fluid transport is passive and directional towards the lizard's snout. The directionality is based on geometric principles, namely on a periodic pattern of interconnected half-open capillary channels that narrow and widen. Following a biomimetic approach, these principles were transferred to technical prototype design and manufacturing. Capillary structures, 50 μm to 300 μm wide and approx. 70 μm deep, were realized by use of a pulsed picosecond laser in hot working tool steel, hardened to 52 HRC. In order to achieve highest functionality, strategies were developed to minimize potential structural inaccuracies, which can occur {{at the bottom of}} the capillary structures caused by the laser process. Such inaccuracies are in the range of 10 μm to 15 μm and form sub-capillary structures with greater capillary forces than the main channels. Hence, an Acceleration Compensation Algorithm was developed for the laser process to minimize or even avoid these inaccuracies. The capillary design was also identified to have substantial influence; by a hexagonal capillary network of non-parallel <b>capillaries</b> <b>potential</b> influences of sub-capillaries on the functionality were reduced to realize a robust passive directional capillary transport.

40|$|AbstractThe term “wrong-way-round ionization” {{has been}} used in studies of {{electrospray}} ionization to describe the observation of protonated or deprotonated ions when sampling strongly basic or acidic solutions (respectively) where such ions are not expected to exist in appreciable concentrations in solution. Study of the dependence of ionization of the weak base caffeine on the electrospray <b>capillary</b> <b>potential</b> reveals three distinct contributors to wrong-way-round ionization. At near-neutral pH in solutions of low ionic strength, protonation of caffeine results from the surface enrichment of electrolytically produced protons in the surface layer of the droplets from which ions are desorbed. For solutions made strongly basic with ammonia, gas-phase proton transfer from ammonium ions can create protonated caffeine. These two mechanisms have been discussed previously elsewhere. For solutions of high ionic strength at neutral or high pH, the data suggest that discharge-induced ionization is responsible for the production of protonated caffeine. This mechanism probably accounts for some of the wrong-way-round ionization reported elsewhere...|$|E

Higher bulk porosity corresponds to reduced volumetric heat capacity (C), but increased sorptivity (S) and vapour permeance (W). Since bulk porosity and void size distribution (VSD) are interdependent variables, it follows that for constant particle size distribution (PSD) and compaction energy an increase in porosity results in an increase in the mean pore radius, for a material.

The compounds were characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy and MS spectrometry, their UV–vis spectra were recorded at various pH, and their purity was determined by <b>capillary</b> electrophoresis. Two <b>potential</b> models for the supramolecular assembly of the xanthene-dye-appended cyclodextrins were developed based {{on the set of}} data collected by the extensive NMR characterization...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{and land}} {{ecosystem}} models simulate a dry-season vegetation {{stress in the}} Amazon forest, but observations do not support these results, indicating adequate water supply. Proposed mechanisms include larger soil water store and deeper roots in nature {{and the ability of}} roots to move water up and down (hydraulic redistribution), both absent in the models. Here we provide a first-order assessment of the potential importance of the upward soil water flux from the groundwater driven by capillarity. We present a map of equilibrium water table depth from available observations and a groundwater model simulation constrained by these observations. We then present a map of maximum capillary flux these water table depths, combined with the fine-textured soils in the Amazon, can potentially support. The maps show that the water table beneath the Amazon can be shallow in lowlands and river valleys (− 1 to the land surface averaged over Amazonia, but varies from 0. 6 to 3. 7 mm day− 1 across nine study sites. We note that the results presented here are based on limited observations and simple equilibrium model calculations, and as such, have important limitations and must be interpreted accordingly. The <b>potential</b> <b>capillary</b> fluxes are not indicative of their contribution to the actual evapotranspiration, and they are only an assessment of the possible rate at which this flux can occur, to illustrate the power of soil capillary force acting on a shallow water table in fine textured soils. They may over-estimate the actual flux where the surface soils remain moist. Their contribution to the actual evapotranspiration can only be assessed through fully coupled model simulation of the dynamic feedbacks between soil water and groundwater with sub-daily climate forcing. The equilibrium water table obtained here serves as the initial state for the dynamic simulation, and together with the equilibrium <b>potential</b> <b>capillary</b> flux, will serve as a baseline to evaluate the diurnal, event, seasonal and inter-annual dynamics...|$|R
