40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{develop a}} method to measure end expiratory nitric oxide {{concentration}} and {{to use it to}} determine whether there are sex related differences between healthy men and women. DESIGN [...] Modification of commercially available <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>analyser</b> to allow endogenous nitric oxide (endothelium derived relaxing factor) to be measured in a single slow forced vital capacity manoeuvre with evaluation of between and within subject variability. Serial measurements in women throughout the menstrual cycle. SETTING [...] Specialist referral hospital. SUBJECTS [...] 59 healthy volunteers (40 men and 19 women). RESULTS [...] Mean (SD) peak expiratory concentrations of nitric oxide in men (75 (20) ppb (parts per billion)), and women (70 (37) ppb (first measurement)) were > 5 times those previously recorded. In women concentrations at midcycle (150 (39) ppb) were significantly higher (mean difference 94. 9 (41), P < 0. 001) than during menstruation (59 (25) ppb). CONCLUSION [...] Nitric oxide production (endothelium derived relaxing factor activity) is influenced by cyclical hormonal changes in women. There was an increase of more than 100 % at mid cycle. This may be pertinent to the lower risk of cardiovascular disease in premenopausal women...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} first field {{deployment}} {{and testing of}} a directional passive air sampler (DPAS) {{which can be used}} to cost-effectively identify and quantify air pollutants and their sources. The sampler was used for ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) over ten weeks from twelve directional sectors in an urban setting, and tested alongside an automatic chemiluminescent monitor. The time-integrated passive directional results were compared with the directional analysis of the active monitoring results using wind data recorded at a weather station. The DPAS discriminated air pollutant signals directionally. The attempts to derive quantitative data yielded reasonable results-usually within a factor of two of those obtained by the <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>analyser.</b> Ultimately, whether DPAS approaches are adopted will depend on their reliability, added value and cost. It is argued that added value was obtained here from the DPAS approach applied in a routine monitoring situation, by identifying source sectors. Both the capital and running costs of DPAS were < 5 % of those for the automatic monitor. It is envisaged that different sorbents or sampling media will enable this rotatable DPAS design to be used for other airborne pollutants. In summary, there are reasons to be optimistic that directional passive air sampling, together with careful interpretation of results, will be of added value to air quality practitioners in future...|$|E

The latter facilities also provided data on ozone and NO concentrations and meteorological conditions. Daily averages from the two pairs of badges in different types of sampling cover in each site have been compared with data from the <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>analysers,</b> and found largely to agree within error margins of +/- 30 %. Although NO 2 and ozone concentrations were low, rendering detailed discussion impossible, the general features followed expected patterns...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of aerosols with the photochemistry of the troposphere is simulated in a smog chamber. The aerosol smog chamber {{consists of a}} solar simulator (with up to three-fold light intensity of the lower troposphere) and a cylindrical glass vessel (2. 4 cubic meters volume with thermostatted lid and bottom). It enables us to obtain long residence times of aerosols longer than 1 day. A photochemical smog is produced by irradiating a mixture of NO sub x (200 ppb NO 2 + 100 ppb NO) and various n-alkanes (from propane up to n-nonane), iso-alkanes and aromatics (up to 30 compounds, 100 ppb each). The concentrations of the active constituents of the photosmog, NO sub x and O 3, are monitored using <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>analysers,</b> the concentrations of other active species are computed from the degradation rate of the hydrocarbons using known rate constants. In the presence and absence of SiO 2 aerosol (Aerosil) the degradation behaviour of the hydrocarbons is observed {{to be dominated by}} reactions of OH radicals. Aerosol densities up to 1 mg m - 3 have been without any impact on the chemistry of OH radicals. This enables us to study the photodegradation of non-volatile organic compounds, adsorbed as a layer on the inert SiO 2 carrier, by the reaction of the active species, OH and O 3, from the photosmog. In contrast to the results in the presence of SiO 2 aerosol in the presence of TiO 2 (which is an UV-absorbing semiconductor material) the concentration of OH is enhanced by a factor of ten.

40|$|Experimental {{results for}} a {{reactive}} non-buoyant plume of nitric oxide (NO) in a turbulent grid flow doped with ozone (O 3) are presented. The Damkohler number (Nd) for the experiment is of order unity indicating the turbulence and chemistry have similar timescales and both affect the chemical reaction rate. Continuous measurements of two components of velocity using hot-wire anemometry {{and the two}} reactants using <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>analysers</b> have been made. A spatial resolution for the reactants of four Kolmogorov scales has been possible because of the novel design of the experiment. Measurements at this resolution for a reactive plume are {{not found in the}} literature. The experiment has been conducted relatively close to the grid in the region where self-similarity of the plume has not yet developed. Statistics of a conserved scalar, deduced from both reactive and non-reactive scalars by conserved scalar theory, are used to establish the mixing field of the plume, which is found to be consistent with theoretical considerations and with those found by other investigators in non-reative flows. Where appropriate the reactive species means and higher moments, probability density functions, joint statistics and spectra are compared with their respective frozen, equilibrium and reaction-dominated limits deduced from conserved scalar theory. The theoretical limits bracket reactive scalar statistics where this should be so according to conserved scalar theory. Both reactants approach their equilibrium limits with greater distance downstream. In the region of measurement, the plume reactant behaves as the reactant not in excess and the ambient reactant behaves as the reactant in excess. The reactant covariance lies outside its frozen and equilibrium limits for this value of Vd. The reaction rate closure of Toor (1969) is compared with the measured reaction rate. The gradient model is used to obtain turbulent diffusivities from turbulent fluxes. Diffusivity of a non-reactive scalar is found to be close to that measured in non-reactive flows by others...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Impairment of the {{fertility}} in the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor transgenic female mice suggests changes in PAF functions can influence uterine receptivity. We hypothesized that vasodilatory actions of PAF in the uterus was exerted by PAF-mediated nitric oxide (NO) release via activation of isoenzyme-specific protein kinase C (PKC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inducible and endothelial NOS was shown by Reverse transcription {{polymerase chain reaction}} RT-PCR in cDNA synthesized from RNA extract of proliferative and secretory endometrium as well endometrial epithelial cell lines HEC- 1 B. The effect of WEB 2170, N(G) -monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and Ro 31 - 8220 on PAF mediated NO release by HEC- 1 B cell was determined. PAF induced translocation of PKCalpha in HEC- 1 B cell and its antagonist effect by Ro 31 - 8220 was studied by Western immunoblot analysis. PKC isoenzyme regulated by PAF was determined in HEC- 1 B cell lysate by immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: PAF-evoked a rapid and concentration-dependent biphasic increase in total NO in human HEC- 1 B endometrial epithelial cell line [as measured by a Sievers NOA 280 A NO <b>Chemiluminescent</b> <b>Analyser.</b> ] This increase in NO release was attenuated by the PAF receptor antagonist, WEB 2170. Inhibition of NO synthesis by N(G) -monomethyl-L-arginine produced marked dose-dependent attenuation of PAF-mediated NO release, indicating nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activation. PAF-mediated NO release was also inhibited by the PKC inhibitor Ro 31 - 8220 and by the removal of extracellular calcium, suggesting a dependency on PKC and calcium, respectively. RT-PCR analysis showed expression of inducible NOS and endothelial NOS in human endometrium, myometrium and HEC- 1 B cells. Western immunoblot analysis showed PKCalpha, betaII and iota were the principal isozymes present in the HEC- 1 B cell line and normal endometrium, suggesting that both HEC- 1 B cells and normal endometrium have similar PKC isozymes. PAF induced the translocation of both PKCalpha and PKCiota within the time frame of NO release. The translocation of PKCalpha, but not PKCiota, was susceptible to inhibition by Ro 31 - 8220 that also inhibited PAF-evoked NO release, suggesting that PKCalpha is the principal isozyme involved in this process and that eNOS may be a substrate for PKCalpha. Kinase assays performed using immunoprecipitated PKCalpha showed that PAF (1 nM) activated PKCalpha that was inhibited by co-incubation with Ro 31 - 8220 and Ca(2 +) -free medium. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that PAF-stimulated NO release via PKCalpha in epithelial cells might regulate endometrial functions such as implantation and menstruation...|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} carried out under {{laboratory}} conditions to study turbulent mixing with chemical reaction. Such flows are common in the environment but there are few high-resolution measurements of them under controlled conditions. The reaction NO + O 3 → NO 2 + O 2 + 200 kJ (mol) − 1 (in the absence of UV radiation) has been used by introducing a non-buoyant reactive plume of NO into a turbulent grid flow doped with O 3. The experiments have been conducted over a wide range of conditions by varying the Damko¨hler number (the ratio of the flow timescale to that of the chemical reaction) by a factor of 6 and varying the ratio of initial reactant concentrations by a factor of 30. The data are presented in two park. Part 1 (present paper) presents conventional concentration statistics. Part 2 presents concentration statistics conditionally averaged by a mixing parameter and discusses their usefulness for investigating; the reactive behaviour of the plume. Specially developed <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>analysers</b> are used to measure NO and O 3 concentrations with high-frequency response and a spatial resolution of four Kolmogorov scales (in this flow). The mixing field of the plume is studied using conserved scalar theory and is compared. to that obtained in other non-reactive flows. Results for the means, variances and joint statistics of the reactive species are presented and compared with frozen and equilibrium limits obtained from the conserved scalar theory for reacting flows. Statistics for NO show no significant trend with Damko¨hler number while those for O 3 and NO 2 have increased reaction at higher Damko¨hler number. The reactive scalar means are bounded by the frozen and equilibrium limits as they should be according to conserved scalar theory. Other reactive scalar statistics are not necessarily bounded by the limits. A simple relation between moments of O 3 and N 02 is found in the experimental results and is confirmed by conserved scalar theory. Contribution to the mean reaction rate from the reactant covariance and product of means is compared and it is found that both are significant under the present conditions. Intensity of segregation varies over a wide range and is sensitive to initial reactant concentrations...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the concern about the {{behaviour}} of oxides of nitrogen (NOx: NO, NO 2) in atmosphere has increased considerably. NOx undergoes various complex atInospheric reactions to generate secondary pollutants which are known to cause severe adverse effects on human health. This work focuses {{on the study of}} physical and chemical fate of NOx released in the atmosphere from vehicles, which are the main sources of atmospheric NOx. Keeping the objective and standard guidelines for monitoring in view, two typical sites near the road with high vehicular density were chosen for the study. One site was a relatively cleaner area with only vehicles as major source of pollution, and the second site was a traffic junction in an industrial region, where pollution levels are amongst the highest in Mumbai. Ambient monitoring of NOx was done for 24 hr continuously using <b>chemiluminescent</b> NOx <b>analyser.</b> The data was used to analyse temporal and spatial variation of NO, NO 2 and NOx and their atmospheric chemical reactions. The monitoring results show that at larger distance from the road the level of NO decreases but the concentration of NO 2 which is very harmful remains the same. Statistical analysis is conducted to establish the relationship between likely change in NO 2 concentration as a result of NOx emission changes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Nitric oxide is {{released}} from pulmonary endothelial cells {{and contributes to}} the low pulmonary vascular resistance. The resistance pulmonary arteries are in close anatomical proximity to membranous airways, so {{it is likely that}} some pulmonary endothelial nitric oxide will enter the airspace to allow its measurement in the exhaled breath. METHODS [...] Exhaled air was collected from a single full exhalation and during tidal breathing. This was analysed for concentrations of nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon dioxide to give alveolar (FA) and mixed expired (FE) concentrations. Eight normal subjects were studied and laboratory air was similarly analysed using, respectively, <b>chemiluminescent</b> and infrared <b>analysers.</b> RESULTS [...] There was no relation between FA concentrations and the laboratory air concentrations. From the single breath, the ratio of (Fano/Faco 2) x (Feco 2 /Feno) had a mean value of 0. 92 (95 % confidence interval 0. 7 to 1. 14). As this does not differ from unity, nitric oxide is likely to be derived from the same regions of the lungs as carbon dioxide. During tidal breathing the Feno ranged from 8. 3 to 20. 3 parts per billion. CONCLUSIONS [...] It is possible to measure endogenous pulmonary nitric oxide production in the exhaled air in man...|$|R
