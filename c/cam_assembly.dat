On the negative side, a quick-release hub renders a wheel more vulnerable to theft and care must be taken to ensure that the mechanism is properly tightened.|$|E
50|$|A typical trapped-key {{interlock}} device {{consists of a}} lock cylinder which operates a sliding bolt through a <b>cam.</b> The <b>assembly</b> is contained in a housing, which is made in different styles to accommodate different applications. The sliding bolt, when extended, mechanically prevents operation of a switch, valve, gate, or other device. Many variations exist, with different shapes of interlock bolt and multiple lock cylinders on an interlock. A significant feature of the interlock is that the key is held or trapped in one position of the lock. Releasing the key indicates that the interlocked device has been made safe; the interlocked device cannot be re-energized until the key has been returned and operated to retract the bolt.|$|R
40|$|Introduction The National Design Repository {{project was}} begun in 1995 {{as an effort}} to serve {{researchers}} in engineering design, manufacturing process planning and geometric and solid modeling. The Repository is a collection of public domain computeraided design data {{from a variety of sources}} and vendors. This data includes solid models and CAD files, computer-aided manufacturing (<b>CAM)</b> information, <b>assemblies,</b> simulations and a limited number of process and machining plans. Repository users employ its content as test data and benchmarks [...] - enabling the wider research community to collaborate on bigger research problems. As we build this testbed, we have sought to integrate ideas from a variety of computing and engineering disciplines to create a living knowledge-base of design data. Our goals for the Repository include (1) developing representations for design knowledge; (2) creating query engines to interrogate the knowledge-base and identify patterns of interest (e. g., designs...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMutations in KCNQ 2 and KCNQ 3 {{genes are}} {{responsible}} for benign familial neonatal seizures and epileptic encephalopathies. Some of these mutations {{have been shown to}} alter the binding of calmodulin (CaM) to specific C-terminal motifs of KCNQ subunits, known as the A and B helices. Here, we show that the mutation I 342 A in the A helix of KCNQ 3 abolishes CaM interaction and strongly decreases the heteromeric association with KCNQ 2. The assembly of KCNQ 2 with KCNQ 3 is essential for their expression at the axon initial segment (AIS). We find that the I 342 A mutation alters the targeting of KCNQ 2 / 3 subunits at the AIS. However, the traffic of the mutant channels was rescued by provision of exogenous CaM. We show that CaM enhances the heteromeric association of KCNQ 2 /KCNQ 3 -I 342 A subunits by binding to their B helices in a calcium-dependent manner. To further assert the implication of <b>CaM</b> in channel <b>assembly,</b> we inserted a mutation in the second coil-coil domain of KCNQ 2 (KCNQ 2 -L 638 P) to prevent its heteromerization with KCNQ 3. We observe that the expression of a Ca(2 +) -insensitive form of <b>CaM</b> favours the <b>assembly</b> of KCNQ 3 with KCNQ 2 -L 638 P. Our data thus indicate that both apoCaM and Ca(2 +) /CaM bind to the C-terminal domains of KCNQ 2 and KCNQ 3 subunits, and regulate their heteromeric <b>assembly.</b> Hence, <b>CaM</b> may control the composition and distribution of KCNQ channels in neurons...|$|R

To load the mechanism, driving link was created as a rotary table of screen printing press with four positions for mounting products. A <b>cam</b> mechanism <b>assembly</b> was created with overlap of the necessary links between elements. According to the power parameters of a table, calculation was conducted, processing of the values was carried out and compared with values used for the calculations. It was determined that the deviation of data obtained as a result of modeling compared to the theoretical data is within acceptable limits at 1. 3 %. Thus, the conducted simulation of a cam mechanism with periodic rotation using the new automated design program Autodesk Inventor Simulation allowed to confirm the workability of the proposed method of calculation and the correctness of the theoretical principles and adopted assumptions. ? ?????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{published}} as Surface Engineering, 2005, 21, (1), pp. 67 - 71. It {{is available from}} [URL] Doi: 10. 1179 / 174329405 X 30039 Diamond like carbon (DLC) coatings have been investigated for application in the automotive valve train and, in particular, the camshaft drive assembly. The drive assembly can have various force transfer devices, such as an overhead bucket tappet <b>assembly</b> or a <b>cam</b> follower <b>assembly.</b> Force transfer devices operate in severe tribological contact situations with maximum Hertzian stresses approaching 1 GN m− 2 and temperatures in the range 100 – 150 °C. Lubrication is often partially starved and, therefore, the thermochemical properties and surface finish of the components are critical to their successful operation. For motor sport applications, DLC offers improved wear resistance over steel alone; and for passenger vehicles, the high hardness and commensurately lower friction coefficient that DLC gives against steel counterfaces offers improvements in fuel economy and lower wear. This paper presents the results from {{an investigation of the}} wear of DLC coated shims against standard production camshafts. DLC offers benefits in terms of reducing shim wear, but increases the wear of the camshaft. The wear mechanism observed for DLC is dependent on the oil type, but generally it is a pitting type mechanism. The cam wear occurs by plastic ratchetting. The consequences of the results are discussed in terms of the implementation of such coatings in standard valve train applications...|$|R
40|$|Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} {{polymer matrix}} composites (CF PMCs) are increasingly used in state-of-the-art aerospace applications. Aerospace manufacturers favour components made of CF PMCs over those made of traditional metallic alloys {{because of their}} light weight and corrosion resistance, which lead to significant improvements in fuel consump- tion, increased payload capability, and reduced maintenance and inspection costs. How- ever, manufacturing of CF PMC components is performed differently than traditional material in all stages – design, prototyping and production – and therefore, many com- mercial manufacturers have only recently begun producing components with CF PMCs. The {{first half of this}} thesis was written as a contribution to the CRIAQ COMP- 501 project, which focusses on investigating the cost-effective procurement of airframe com- ponents that are manufactured from final-thickness, net-shaped, and through-thickness reinforced CF preforms. Reinforcement preforms were assembled from commercial 2 D woven fabric using stacks of various configurations of structural through-thickness CF stitch. The contribution herein provides the results obtained from investigations into the mechanical behaviour of the relevant reinforcements, when subjected to pre-infusion op- erations typical to RTM VARTM; mechanical behaviour in compaction, shear (draping) and bending (forming). The second half of this thesis presents the major developments which were made to an alternative process for producing thick 3 D preforms with great versatility, a process originally proposed as a candidate for supplying preforms to the COMP- 501 project. This process interfaces a proprietary kinematic drape optimization (CAD) software with proprietary automated dry fibre placement <b>assembly</b> (<b>CAM)</b> machinery to produce vari- able or final-thickness reinforcements which are highly-drapable and can lay steered tow yarns...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to design and {{evaluate}} a simple bioreactor system capable of medium term culture of native and engineered aortic valves. It is thought that cyclic mechanical stimulation is necessary to maintain the normal morphology of the tissue. The current design permits the cyclic opening and closing of 3 aortic valves, however this device could easily be modified to culture up to 12 valves simultaneously. The system consists of 3 pistons in separate culture chambers that are driven through the culture medium at the same rate by a crank and <b>cam</b> <b>assembly.</b> The faces of these pistons have unidirectional valves mounted in opposing orientations that permit flow from one side of the face to the other. A custom designed stent was employed to secure the biologic (porcine or engineered) valves to the pistons. Basic CFD and FEA modeling was used to assist selection of materials and components in the system. Finally, sterility testing was done using medium without antibiotics and samples were inspected at experimentally relevant time points. This new bioreactor system has applications not only for development of tissue-engineered valves, but for also studying disease models in the aortic valve...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} model fuel combustion processes {{is essential to}} the development of transportation, power generation, and manufacturing technology. Models describing the kinetics of chemical oxidation are readily available and highly refined {{for a wide range of}} test fuels. However, these models still suffer from high levels of uncertainty under engine-relevant conditions, largely due to a lack of consistency between published validation data. An experimental testing apparatus, known as the Rapid Compression Controlled-Expansion Machine (RCCEM) has been designed and fabricated to conduct chemical kinetic studies. The RCCEM features a pneumatically-driven, custom-designed cam, which governs the volumetric compression and expansion of the combustion chamber. This machine has been designed to test various compression ratios, compressed pressures, and compressed temperatures. Central to the operation of the RCCEM, the <b>cam</b> <b>assembly</b> is modular with the ability to incorporate different cams with unique compression and expansion profiles. This capability is intended to control heat loss rates in experiments via volumetric expansion, and as a result, increase understanding of its influence on the interpretation of validation data. Performance characterization of the RCCEM, using iso-octane and hexane, has shown that the machine is capable of testing a wide range of conditions with exceptional repeatability. Ignition delay times for iso-octane are reported for compressed temperatures of 630 - 700 K. Additionally, two computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies have been conducted to investigate the role of non-uniform boundary temperatures as a potential cause of discrepancies among data in the literature. The effect of these boundary conditions on ignition delay time predictions and compressed-gas temperature field development has been investigated for heated RCM experiments that use either creviced or flat pistons. Three unique boundary temperature cases for non-reactive simulations showed that a large temperature gradient forms over the crown of the piston due to heterogeneities present in the initial temperature fields. Subsequently, five boundary temperature cases were investigated for reactive simulations and demonstrated the effect of these non-uniformities on ignition delay time predictions. Through this work, it was determined that the flat piston is susceptible to these non-uniform conditions causing discrepancies in ignition delay times, whereas the creviced piston data was only minimally influenced...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{survive in}} today's hostile {{business}} environment, companies must constantly introduce {{new products and}} adapt their strategy to change. Managing product variety may therefore be considered as an important competitive factor. However, this requires resources in terms of people, equipment, inventory and raw material—all of which go against a Lean strategy. Mastering complexity becomes increasingly important in several industries, and companies {{must find a way}} to balance between lean and offering product variety. As robots become less expensive and more ‘intelligent’, in combination with more advanced <b>CAM</b> solutions, automated <b>assembly</b> may become beneficial at much lower quantities than in the past. Also, development of new manufacturing methods may enable new product designs, and vice-versa. In this emerging paradigm shift—also referred to as Industry 4. 0 —companies must enhance their integrative capabilities and facilitate knowledge sharing between product engineering and production to sustain competitive advantage. This paper discusses organizational capabilities and tools required to enable transformation into Industry 4. 0. Literature on Integrated Product and Process Development (IPPD), Concurrent Engineering (CE) and Lean has been studied. This state-of-the-art is seen in connection with efforts made in a research project with the goal to increase competitive advantage by leveraging capabilities in automated manufacturing of large and complex products—a manufacturing context that is regarded as difficult to automate in an economical way. The results show that investing in the latest manufacturing technology alone will not provide the capabilities required. It is also necessary to invest in people skills, knowledge and organizational learning. Process design and design-for-automation must be considered already from the conceptual product design to avoid expensive re-designs and design loops. The use of physical and virtual demonstrators proved to facilitate an efficient and effective design process...|$|R
