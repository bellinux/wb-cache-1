25|$|Whereas the German army {{realized}} it needed close <b>cooperation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> homefront, Habsburg officers {{saw themselves as}} entirely separate from the civilian world, and superior to it. When they occupied productive areas, such as Romania, they seized food stocks and other supplies for their own purposes, and blocked any shipments intended for civilians back in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The result was that the officers lived well, as the civilians began to starve. Vienna even transferred training units to Serbia and Poland {{for the sole purpose}} of feeding them. In all, the Army obtained about 15 percent of its cereal needs from occupied territories.|$|E

25|$|The Asia Minor Expedition and Catastrophe, {{as well as}} the {{uprooting}} of {{the ethnic}} Greek population from Anatolia after three thousand years of presence, had an enormous impact on the Greek psyche. The Smyrna Catastrophe has been considered as the worst incident of modern Greek history, and as an incident of the same magnitude as the Fall of Constantinople for the Greeks. The matters related to the refugees halted the Greco-Turkish relations for many decades. The issues concerning the missing Greeks were soon raised in the International Red Cross, without any success and <b>cooperation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Turkish side.

Theorizing that a plot to kill the President was masterminded out of New Orleans {{in conjunction with the}} CIA with <b>cooperation</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Dallas police department and city government, Garrison tasked his chief investigator, Pershing Gervais, of looking into the possibility that General Cabell had stayed in the city's Fontainebleau Motel {{at the time of the}} assassination.

In July 2002, FDLR units still in Kinshasa-held territory moved into North and South Kivu. At {{this time it was}} thought to have between 15,000 and 20,000 members. Even after the official end of the Second Congo War in 2002, FDLR units continued to attack Tutsi forces both in eastern DRC and across the border into Rwanda, vastly increasing tensions in the region and raising the possibility of another Rwandan offensive into the DRC – what would be their third since 1996. In mid-2004, a number of attacks forced 25,000 Congolese to flee their homes.|$|E

Soon thereafter, the local commanders of Polish Armia Krajowa were invited to {{a meeting with the}} commanders of the Red Army. During the meeting, they were arrested, as {{it turned out to be}} a trap set by the Soviet NKVD. Later, in the winter and spring of 1945, the local NKVD kept arresting and harassing Poles in Lviv (which according to Soviet sources on October 1, 1944 still had a clear Polish majority of 66.7%) in an attempt to encourage their emigration from the city. Those arrested were released only after they had signed papers in which they agreed to emigrate to Poland, which postwar borders were to be shifted westwards in accordance with the Yalta conference settlements. In Yalta, despite Polish objections, the Allied leaders, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill decided that Lviv should remain within the borders of the Soviet Union. On August 16, 1945, a border agreement was signed in Moscow between the government of the Soviet Union and the Provisional Government of National Unity installed by the Soviets in Poland. In the treaty, Polish authorities formally ceded prewar eastern part of the country to the Soviet Union, agreeing to the Polish-Soviet border to be drawn according to the so-called Curzon Line. Consequently, the agreement was ratified on February 5, 1946.|$|E
