If the same projection fault occurs for <b>term</b> <b>assurance</b> policies, life insurers writing <b>term</b> <b>assurance</b> policies {{were likely to}} {{have benefited from the}} improving mortality and the profit could be significant in comparison with annuities. This dissertation uses quantitative research method by developing cash flows for term policies and using the moneys worth ratio and profit ratio to test the policys profitability. The result shows that life insurers writing <b>term</b> <b>assurance</b> policies have benefited from the improving mortality. In particular, term policy for older lives has shown significant profit. In addition, life insurers have benefited more from long term policies than short term, policies for elders benefited more than for the young, and policies for nonsmokers benefited more than for combined policies (nonsmokers and smokers) ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the {{calibration}} of affine stochastic mortality models using <b>term</b> <b>assurance</b> premiums. We view <b>term</b> <b>assurance</b> contracts as a "swap" in which policyholders exchange cash flows (premiums vs. benefits) with an insurer analogous to a generic interest rate swap or credit default swap. Using a simple bootstrapping procedure, we derive the term structure of mortality rates from a stream of contract quotes with different maturities. This term structure is used to calibrate the parameters of affine stochastic mortality models where the survival probability is expressed in closed form. The Vasicek, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, and jump-extended Vasicek models are considered for fitting the survival probabilities term structure. An evaluation of the performance of these models is provided with respect to premiums of three Italian insurance companies.

50|$|Based on the {{operators}} within lambda calculus, application and abstraction, {{it is possible}} to develop an algebra whose group structure uses application and abstraction as binary operators. Application is defined as an operation between lambda terms producing a λ-term, e.g. the application of λ onto the lambda term a produces the lambda term &lambda;a. Abstraction incorporates undefined variables by denoting λx.t(x) as the function assigning the variable a to the lambda term with value t(a) via the operation ((λ x.t(x))a = t(a)). Lastly, an equivalence relation emerges which identifies λ-terms modulo <b>convertible</b> <b>terms,</b> an example being beta normal form.|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{notions of}} strong and weak normalization refer to properties of a binary reduction relation. In this {{paper we explore}} an alternative approach to normalization, where we bypass the reduction relation and instead focus on the normalization function, that is, the function which maps a term into its normal form. We work in an intuitionistic metalanguage, and characterize a normalization function as an algorithm which picks a canonical representative from the equivalence class of <b>convertible</b> <b>terms.</b> Hence we also get a decision algorithm for convertibility. Such a normalization function can be constructed by building an appropriate model and a function "quote" which inverts the interpretation function.

Self-interpreters and self-reducers What is a self-interpreter? For the untyped λ-calculus, Mogensen (1992) offers the following definition, given an injective mapping x y (the representation scheme) that yields representations of arbitrary terms: E xMy β M. That is, a self-interpreter is a term E of the λ-calculus such that when applied to the representation xMy of any term M, the result is a <b>convertible</b> <b>term</b> (modulo renaming). The x y mapping 1 cannot of course be defined within the λ-calculus itself, but we posit its existence as a primitive operation of the calculus. The representation of a term is a piece of data, something that can be manipulated, transformed and inspected within the calculus itself. It is natural to represent data as terms in normal form, so that data may be regarded as constant with regard to term reduction. Consider the following grammar for terms and normal terms: Var Q x, y, z Term Q t � x | λx. t | t t Term TermNF Q tn � ta | λx. tn Term TermA Q ta � x | ta tn The representation scheme can be typed as x y: Term Ñ TermNF. All manner of representation schema are possible, but Mogensen commits to a particularly simple representation scheme, one that enables him to implement a trivially simple self-interpreter that not only yields <b>convertible</b> <b>terms</b> from their representations, but in fact whose weak head normal form when applied to a normal term M is identical to M, up to renaming of variables. Let us call this particular self-interpreter Eα. We have that Eα xMy ÝÑwhnf M. Mogensen goes on to define a self-reducer as a transformation on representations: R xMy β xNFM y, where NFM stands for the normal form of M, if one exists. Equipped with such a contraption, we can define a special kind of self-interpreter with the additional property that all representations of terms evaluate to normal forms. For all M...|$|R
