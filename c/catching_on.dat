Sargent and Wallace's policy ineffectiveness proposition found that economic agents would anticipate inflation and adjust to higher price levels before the influx of monetary stimulus could boost employment and output. Only unanticipated monetary policy could increase employment, and no central bank could systematically use monetary policy for expansion without economic agents <b>catching</b> <b>on</b> and anticipating price changes before they could have a stimulative impact.|$|E
5|$|Variety and realism were focuses for the tracks: they {{featured}} visuals such as forests, Neon Cities, and Canyons, {{complete with}} obstacles. The team travelled {{to photograph the}} textures. The tracks were constructed in Softimage 3D and converted to PlayStation format mesh data using a custom tool. In response to a common criticism of the original Destruction Derby, the tracks were designed to be larger and less narrow. The team were inspired by Daytonas revolving windmills, and large jumps were implemented to add drama to the tracks. The most realistic aspect of the race tracks was the pit stop, although Edmondson stated that he limited players to one stop because the team {{did not want to}} detract from the action and because a penalty system would have added a lot of extra work. Cars nearing destruction were designed to behave in a realistic and unpredicatable fashion through effects such as losing the bonnet (hood) and <b>catching</b> <b>on</b> fire.|$|E

At the time of the song's release, Madonna's style of dress was <b>catching</b> <b>on</b> as a fashion statement among club kids and her fans.

Madonna commented that wearing a rosary and a crucifix is [...] "kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheeks. Besides, the crucifixes seem to go with my name." [...] In reality, she was trying to find a separate image for herself, being inspired by then artists like Boy George, Cyndi Lauper and David Bowie, and their constantly shifting image and persona. Madonna realized the importance of her music videos and its popularity via MTV—launched in 1981—was instrumental in popularizing her image.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the first}} Test match, it was noticed that despite British and Irish Lions fans being filmed singing The Power of Four, {{none of the}} players did sing it when it was played as the Lions anthem before God Defend New Zealand.

It was also suggested that due to a perceived selection bias towards English members of the Lions, that Land of Hope and Glory should be used instead of The Power of Four. The acting British and Irish Lions captain Martin Corry said that he did not attempt to sing The Power of Four because he felt {{that he would not be}} able to reach the correct notes.

500|$|In Western movies, the characters' gun belts {{are often}} worn {{low on the}} hip and outer thigh, with the holster cut away around the pistol's trigger and grip for a smooth, fast draw. This type of holster is a Hollywood anachronism. Fast-draw artists can be {{distinguished}} from other movie cowboys because their guns will often be tied to their thigh. Long before holsters were steel-lined, they were soft and supple for comfortable all-day wear. A gunfighter would use tie-downs to keep his pistol from <b>catching</b> <b>on</b> the holster while drawing. Most of the time, gunfighters would just hide their pistols in their pockets and waistbands. Wild Bill Hickok popularized the butt-forward holster type, which worked better on horseback. Other gunfighters would use bridgeport rigs that gave a faster and easier draw. Revolvers were a popular weapon to gunfighters who were horsemen, cowboys, and lawmen because of their concealability and effectiveness on horseback. The Winchester rifle was also a popular weapon among gunfighters. Dubbed the [...] "Gun that Won the West", it was widely used during the settlement of the American frontier. Shotguns were also a popular weapon for [...] "express messengers" [...] and guards, especially those on stagecoaches and trains who {{were in charge of}} overseeing and guarding a valuable private shipment.|$|E

500|$|The reverberations of Easy Rider {{could be}} felt in such pictures, {{as well as}} in a host of {{theatrical}} exploitation films. But its greatest influence on the fate of the B movie was less direct—by 1973, the major studios were <b>catching</b> <b>on</b> to the commercial potential of genres once largely consigned to the bargain basement. Rosemary's Baby had been a big hit, but it had little in common with the exploitation style. Warner Bros.' The Exorcist demonstrated that a heavily promoted horror film could be an absolute blockbuster: it was the biggest movie of the year and by far the highest-earning horror movie yet made. In William Paul's description, it is also [...] "the film that really established gross-out as a mode of expression for mainstream cinema.... ast exploitation films managed to exploit their cruelties by virtue of their marginality. The Exorcist made cruelty respectable. By the end of the decade, the exploitation booking strategy of opening films simultaneously in hundreds to thousands of theaters became standard industry practice." [...] Writer-director George Lucas's American Graffiti, a Universal production, did something similar. Described by Paul as [...] "essentially an American-International teenybopper pic with a lot more spit and polish", it was 1973's third biggest film and, likewise, by far the highest-earning teen-themed movie yet made. Even more historically significant movies with B themes and A-level financial backing would follow in their wake.|$|E

[...] In 2001, Warner Bros. Records released a remastered version of the album with its original artwork and two bonus remix tracks of [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Lucky Star".

In an interview with Time magazine, Madonna said: [...] "My father had never believed that what I was doing here [...] was worthwhile, nor did he believe that I was up to any good.

500|$|The critic Michael Medved {{characterized}} {{examples of}} the [...] "so bad it's good" [...] class of low-budget cult film through books such as The Golden Turkey Awards. These films include financially fruitless and critically scorned films that have become inadvertent comedies to film buffs, such as Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) and The Room (2003). [...] Similarly, Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls (1995) bombed in theaters but developed a cult following on video. [...] <b>Catching</b> <b>on,</b> Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer capitalized on the film's ironic appeal and marketed it as a cult film. [...] Sometimes [...] fans will impose their own interpretation of films which have attracted derision, such as reinterpreting an earnest melodrama as a comedy. [...] Jacob deNobel of the Carroll County Times states that films can be perceived as nonsensical or inept when audiences misunderstand avant-garde filmmaking or misinterpret parody. [...] Films such as Rocky Horror can be misinterpreted as [...] "weird for weirdness sake" [...] by people unfamiliar with the cult films that it parodies. [...] deNobel ultimately rejects {{the use of the}} label [...] "so bad it's good" [...] as mean-spirited and often misapplied. [...] Alamo Drafthouse programmer Zack Carlson has further said that any film which succeeds in entertaining an audience is good, regardless of irony. The rise of the Internet and on-demand films has led critics to question whether [...] "so bad it's good" [...] films have a future now that people have such diverse options in both availability and catalog, though fans eager to experience the worst films ever made can lead to lucrative showings for local theaters and merchandisers.|$|E
