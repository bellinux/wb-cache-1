30|$|In conclusion, we {{demonstrate}} that in Korean individuals, pectin {{can change the}} gut microbiota by measuring total sugar levels and microbial composition over time. Pectin was completely degraded by the gut microbiota at 6, 12, and 18  h, and Lachnospira and Faecalibacterium, which can utilize pectin, were increased. Pectin-induced changes in the gut microbiota increased the formation of associated SCFAs from 6  h on, when pectin was decomposed. Therefore, we confirmed that pectin fermentation in gut microbiota samples from Korean individuals induced microbiota compositional changes. Increased pectin utilization and corresponding changes to gut microbiome composition may be beneficial to human health. Further analysis of the gut microbiomes of larger numbers of donors, in addition to experiments regarding <b>cross-feeding</b> <b>and</b> in vivo gut microbiota changes, would provide more accurate results.|$|R

Past theoretical work suggests that the evolution of cooperative cross-feeding in nature may be more challenging than for other types of cooperation. Here we re-evaluate a mathematical model used previously to study persistence of <b>cross-feeding</b> <b>and</b> conclude that the maintenance of cross-feeding interactions could be favoured for a larger parameter ranges than formerly observed.

The model is then extended to the case where multiple alternate substrates may be growth limiting, using the corresponding kinetic analogs for multiple-substrate enzymes. Again, one is led to a Lotka-Volterra analog. In the multiple-substrate model, however, coexistence of multiple genotypes is possible, in contrast to the single-substrate model. The usual Lotka-Volterra conditions for existence and stability of pure or mixed equilibria may all be translated into corresponding statements about the parameters of the chemostat system.

40|$|Abstract Microbial {{ecosystem}} modeling {{is complicated}} by the large number of unknown parameters and the lack of appropriate calibration tools. Here we present a novel computational framework for modeling microbial ecosystems, which combines genome-based model construction with statistical analysis and calibration to experimental data. Using this framework, we examined the dynamics of a community of Escherichia coli strains that emerged in laboratory evolution experiments, during which an ancestral strain diversified into two coexisting ecotypes. We constructed a microbial community model comprising the ancestral and the evolved strains, which we calibrated using separate monoculture experiments. Simulations reproduced the successional dynamics in the evolution experiments, and pathway activation patterns observed in microarray transcript profiles. Our approach yielded detailed insights into the metabolic processes that drove bacterial diversification, involving acetate <b>cross-feeding</b> <b>and</b> competition for organic carbon and oxygen. Our framework provides a missing link towards a data-driven mechanistic microbial ecology. DOI: 10. 7554 /eLife. 08208. 00...|$|R

40|$|Polymicrobial {{communities}} often show complex {{patterns of}} metabolic and ecological interactions, yet {{our understanding of}} how the properties of communities emerge from the metabolic rules of species interactions is still limited. A central feature of metabolic interactions within microbial communities is ‘cross-feeding’, where one species or lineage consumes the metabolic by-products of another. <b>Cross-feeding</b> bacteria excrete <b>and</b> consume a wide range of metabolites and this sets the stage for diverse intra- and inter-specific metabolic interactions. In this thesis, I use ecological and evolutionary theory to address a number of critical questions posed by cross-feeding bacteria, with a particular focus on the role played by microbial metabolism in driving the emergence and dynamics of microbial interactions. First, I explore the conditions that favour the emergence and maintenance of cooperative <b>cross-feeding</b> <b>and</b> show that the evolutionary outcome depends strongly on the shape of the trade-off curves between {{the costs and benefits of}} cooperation. Second, I investigate the origins of cross-feeding interactions via single lineage diversification and derive new predictions on the physiological mechanisms that may explain the stable coexistence of a cross-feeding polymorphism that evolved from a single clone. Third, I investigate what are the ecological consequences of <b>cross-feeding</b> metabolic interactions <b>and</b> demonstrate theoretically that a simple mechanism of trade can generate a diverse array of ecological relationships. Furthermore, I show the importance of the metabolic by-product properties in determining the ecological outcome. Fourth, I investigate how metabolic constraints of individual species shape the emergent functional and structural relationships among species. I show that strong metabolic interdependence drives the emergence of mutualism, robust interspecific mixing, and increased community productivity. Furthermore, I show that these emergent community properties are driven by demographic feedbacks. In general, these findings support the idea that bridging microbial ecology and metabolism is a critical step toward a better understanding of the factors governing the emergence and dynamics of polymicrobial interactions...|$|R

While the urinary tract is an iron-limiting environment, iron acquisition remains poorly characterized for this uropathogen. Microarray analysis of P. mirabilis HI 4320 cultured under iron limitation identified 45 significantly upregulated genes (P [*]≤[*] 0. 05) that represent 21 putative iron-regulated systems. Two gene clusters, PMI 0229 - 0239 and PMI 2596 - 2605, encode putative siderophore systems. PMI 0229 - 0239 encodes a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-independent siderophore system for producing a novel siderophore, proteobactin.

These findings clearly show that proteobactin and the yersiniabactin-related siderophore function as iron acquisition systems. Despite the activity of both siderophores, only mutants lacking the yersiniabactin-related siderophore have reduced fitness in vivo.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of how biodiversity influences ecosystem functioning is entering a new stage of its development through the incorporation {{of information about the}} evolutionary relatedness of species. Bacteria are prime providers of essential ecosystem services, representing an excellent model system to perform biodiversity-ecosystem function research. By using bacteria isolated from petroleum contaminated sites we show that communities composed of poorly related species were more productive than those containing highly related species. The nature of the forces controlling this positive effect of phylogenetic diversity on community productivity depended on the number of species in culture. In communities of two species the positive effect of phylogenetic diversity on productivity was driven by changes in the selection effect. Communities of two distantly related species were dominated by the most productive species in monoculture whereas communities of two closely related species were dominated by the less productive species in monoculture. In communities of four species the positive effect of phylogenetic diversity on productivity was driven by changes in the complementarity effect. In communities composed of four distantly related species the influence of positive interactions such as facilitation, <b>cross-feeding</b> <b>and</b> niche partitioning seemed to overweight the influence of negative interactions such as interference. As a consequence the proportion of species favored by the presence of other species increased as they got less related. Multiple facets of biodiversity may influence ecosystem functioning.
