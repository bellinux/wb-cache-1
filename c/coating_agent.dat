40|$|The {{localized}} {{motion of}} cells within a cluster {{is an important}} feature of living organisms and {{has been found to}} play roles in cell signaling, communication, and migration, thus affecting processes such as proliferation, transcription, and organogenesis. Current approaches for inducing dynamic movement into cells, however, focus predominantly on mechanical stimulation of single cells, affect cell integrity, and, more importantly, need a complementary mechanism to pattern cells. In this article, we demonstrate a new strategy for the mechanical stimulation of large cell clusters, taking advantage of dielectrophoresis. This strategy is based on the cellular spin resonance mechanism, but it utilizes <b>coating</b> <b>agents,</b> such as bovine serum albumin, to create consistent rotation and vibration of individual cells. The treatment of cells with <b>coating</b> <b>agents</b> intensifies the torque induced on the cells while reducing the friction at the cell-cell and cell-substrate interfaces, resulting in the consistent motion of the cells. Such localized motion can be modulated by varying the frequency and voltage of the applied sinusoidal AC signal and can be achieved in the absence and presence of flow. This strategy enables the survival and functioning of moving cells within large-scale clusters to be investigated...|$|R

5000|$|In typical {{laboratory}} use, {{a sample}} {{is placed in}} the specimen chamber of a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Because the SEM uses a beam of electrons to illuminate the sample and produce the three dimensional images often seen in lay news reports and publications as well as professional journals, the sample must be able to conduct electricity. If the sample is metallic, electron conduction is already present because of the natural electrical conductivity of metal. It is non-metallic, the sample is usually coated with a layer of gold and platinum approximately twenty nanometers deep. This is sufficient for the sample to be conductive without being so thick as to [...] "hide" [...] elements present within the sample. When the electrons emitted by the SEM collide with electrons in the atoms of the sample, the physics of typical electron-electron collisions apply, such that sample electrons having less energy in their orbital shells than the energy setting of the SEM (kev setting), will be displaced from their orbits by the higher energy SEM electrons. This leaves the atom in an unstable state, which is remediated by higher energy electrons in the sample [...] "dropping" [...] down to occupy the electron shells previously ejected by the higher energy SEM electrons. In order to accomplish this, the higher energy electrons within the atom must relinquish the excess energy that exists between the ejected electrons and the higher energy electrons. One way of doing this is by the creation of photons of xray energy. This energy can be detected by the electron spectrometer with a detector placed within the specimen chamber of the SEM, and the electrons can be identified as to the elements from which they were emitted. This gives a qualitative picture of which elements are present within the sample, because the energy dispersive spectrometer can scan the entire group of elements present up to the kev setting of the SEM, which is user controlled by simply switching a knob or pressing a button to set the upper limit of the kev power of the SEM's electron beam. It should be noted that by coating non-conductive samples with gold and platinum as described above, significant peaks will appear on the graph at the kev points of gold and platinum. These peaks can usually be easily removed from the graph by the software of the spectroscopy system should they overshadow areas where naturally occurring elements are present. If these elements include gold or platinum, the problem can be sidestepped in the beginning by using carbon as the <b>coating</b> <b>agent.</b> Carbon is electrically conductive but sufficiently [...] "light" [...] such that the typical energy dispersive spectrometer {{will not be able to}} detect it within its usual range of detection, which often goes down to sodium but has difficulty detecting lighter elements without the use of a separate wavelength detector.|$|E
