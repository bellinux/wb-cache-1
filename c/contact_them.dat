5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{psychological}} profile, the Garda broadcast an appeal for information on the RTÉ television programme Crimeline with a request for people whose houses had been broken into in the Grangegorman area to <b>contact</b> <b>them.</b> After interviewing a number of people involved in burglary, they discovered that Dean Lyons had been talking about the killings. Lyons matched the facial composite released by the gardaí and he was questioned on 26 July 1997.|$|E
5|$|At 1:24 pm, Murray emailed a work {{supervisor}} of the nursing school faculty {{that she would be}} out of town for a week due to a death in her family; no one in her family had died. She also said she would <b>contact</b> <b>them</b> when she returned. At 2:05 pm she called a number which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The call lasted approximately five minutes. At 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend and left a voice message promising him they would talk later. This call ended after one minute.|$|E
5|$|Sheldon {{decides to}} set up his own Comic-Con, and tries to {{convince}} several celebrities to appear, including Stan Lee, Bill Nye the Science Guy, Leonard Nimoy, and Wil Wheaton. Since he has restraining orders from Lee, Nimoy, and Nye, he asks Leonard to <b>contact</b> <b>them.</b> He then discovers James Earl Jones, whom he reveres for voicing the Star Wars villain Darth Vader, {{and is going to}} a sushi restaurant, where Sheldon meets him.|$|E
5000|$|At Mickey's girlfriend's now-abandoned house, Ben finds two walkie-talkies. As they {{test the}} walkie-talkies' range, they overhear a {{conversation}} between two survivors, Annie and [...] "The Orchard", implying they belong to an organized group of survivors. Mickey eagerly <b>contacts</b> <b>them</b> and asks to join, only to be flatly refused. Despite Ben's advice, Mickey tries <b>contacting</b> <b>them</b> again several times, but no one replies.|$|R

5|$|The film's {{music was}} {{performed}} by the then-unknown group Earth, Wind & Fire, who {{were living in a}} single apartment with hardly any food at the time. Van Peebles' secretary was dating one of the bandmembers, and convinced him to <b>contact</b> <b>them</b> about performing the music for the film. Van Peebles projected scenes from the film as the band performed the music. By alternating hymn-based vocalization and jazz rhythms, Van Peebles created a sound that foreshadowed the use of sampling in hip hop music.|$|E
5|$|The {{album cover}} {{consists}} of a cropped Polaroid photograph of two unidentified fans taken at a Sonic Youth show in Amherst, Massachusetts in April 1995, during a short tour undertaken while the album was still in production. The fans are depicted wearing T-shirts that were sold as merchandise during that tour; early in 1995, the band was toying {{with the idea of}} changing their name to Washing Machine. Visible on the shirt on the left are signatures by Thalia Zedek and Chris Brokaw of the tour's opening band Come. The photo was taken by Gordon, who believed it could be used as the album cover. The band liked the shot, but the record label did not want to use it without permission from the fans. As the band did not have any way to <b>contact</b> <b>them,</b> their faces had to be cropped out.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{tensions}} between Osden and the rest, he is sent alone to do a species survey in the forest. While he is still out alone, Porlock, one of the scientists on the team, is scared by what he believes {{to be a large}} ape in the forest. The other team members investigate for a couple of days, without finding anything, before Osden fails to <b>contact</b> <b>them</b> at a pre-assigned time. Tomiko leads three others to his camp in the forest, where they find him knocked out, apparently by an unknown assailant. They bring him back to camp, where he gradually recovers, and tells the group that he had felt a strong fear response from the forest itself. Tomiko realizes that the assailant must {{have been one of the}} other team members. While Osden is asleep, the fear emanations from the forest drive Porlock to verbally lash out at Osden, and admit to trying to kill him in the forest. Porlock attempts to assault Osden again, but the others restrain him and place him under a sedative.|$|E

5|$|In June 2015, {{two members}} of the Security Committee of the Czech Parliament visited Uherský Brod and talked to {{multiple}} witnesses. The MPs issued a report condemning handling of the situation by the police. Among other issues, the MPs criticized that policemen parked their cars and put bullet proof vests on within the shooting range of the attacker, initially failed to get information from the witnesses and only later during the intervention attempted to <b>contact</b> <b>them,</b> didn't cover the back exit and thus potentially allowed the perpetrator {{to get out of the}} object and jeopardize other people. The police even let a helicopter land within the shooting range of the attacker. According to MPs, the police left much to be desired in regards of communication and most importantly, they wrongly decided to believe the perpetrator's claim of having hostage even though the witnesses could have readily confirmed that everyone inside was most likely dead. The policemen didn't seal the vicinity of the attack until 1pm and used civilian phones in communication with superior officers instead of using either their own phones or radio transmitters. Minister of Interior Chovanec commented that the MPs failed to interview the policemen and thus didn't get all the relevant information.|$|E
5|$|The Honduras Packet {{reached the}} Black River in November 1822. Bemused {{to find a}} country rather {{different}} from the Sketchs descriptions, and no sign of St Joseph, the emigrants set up camp on the shore, assuming that the Poyaisian authorities would soon <b>contact</b> <b>them.</b> They sent numerous search parties inland; one, guided by natives who recognised the name St Joseph, found some long-forgotten foundations and rubble. Hall quickly came to the private conclusion that MacGregor must have duped them, but reasoned that announcing such concerns prematurely would only demoralise the party and cause chaos. A few weeks after their arrival, {{the captain of the}} Honduras Packet abruptly and unilaterally sailed away amid a fierce storm; the emigrants found themselves alone apart from the natives and two American hermits. Comforting the settlers with vague assurances that the Poyaisian government would find them if they just stayed where they were, Hall set out for Cape Gracias a Dios, hoping to make contact with the Mosquito king or find another ship. Most of the emigrants found it impossible to believe that the Cazique had deliberately misled them, and posited that blame must lie elsewhere, or that there must have been some terrible misunderstanding.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} with church and cathedral officials, held on 11 June, reporters noted that three people had been shot within {{the city in the}} {{previous}} 72 hours. The attendees produced a letter by the Very Reverend Rogers Govender, on behalf of the Dean and Canons of Manchester Cathedral to Sony. It stated that they were currently seeking the advice of lawyers in the matter, and reserved their legal position in relation to the same. It demanded a substantial donation for the cathedral's work with youth in resisting the culture of gun crime and other forms of violence in our society. It further demanded the immediate withdrawal of the game, and that Sony not re-issue it without removing the section of the game containing the Cathedral interior. Govender described the use of images of the cathedral as virtual desecration. The letter stressed that they were in consultation with their lawyers and urged Sony to <b>contact</b> <b>them</b> so there can be a mutually satisfactory conclusion to the matter. Govender told reporters that the church officials had only been told of the content on 8 June 2007, and, after watching footage of gameplay posted on YouTube, said they were dismayed beyond belief and were shocked to see a place of worship being presented to youths as a place where guns may be fired, and that every year, they invite hundreds of teenagers to see the Cathedral and appreciate it as an alternative to violence. They added that it was a shame to have a game like this undermining such important work. They also sought that Sony apologise unreservedly.|$|E

They also feel that Snape can <b>contact</b> <b>them</b> and provide them with help and guidance in life.|$|E
25|$|Teams are {{prohibited}} from contacting friends, family, and acquaintances during the Race without supervision. The Race however may provide them {{with an opportunity to}} <b>contact</b> <b>them</b> at select times.

In special circumstances the production team will allow racers to contact family members outside of a race-required task.|$|E
5000|$|Starkus: A {{scientist}} and Star Healer {{on board a}} space ship, he investigates and tries to [...] "cure stars". He met with Rebecca and Matt and welcomed them. At first, {{he is willing to}} help them as soon as his present mission is finished. Upon hearing that they were accompanied by Spartakus and Arkana, he immediately disappears. Later, when the group returns to their own time and place (in the episode [...] "Star Healer"), he <b>contacts</b> <b>them</b> via Tehrig and informs the surprised Arkana and Spartakus that they are his ancestors. He <b>contacts</b> <b>them</b> again during the series finale, with a message to help them finally save Arkadia.|$|R
5000|$|However, Paper Lions {{subsequently}} {{revealed that}} the MuseBox has now <b>contacted</b> <b>them</b> and that the band will get any money that they're owed. The confusion reportedly stemmed from staff changeover and {{the closure of the}} label's Canadian offices.|$|R

25|$|In {{one extreme}} {{instance}} of self-censorship, the team explored an urban legend stating that a widely available material {{could be used}} to create an explosive. To their surprise, the seemingly unlikely legend proved true, but the material was so easy to obtain, and the resulting explosion so powerful, that the production team decided it would be irresponsible to allow such information to reach the general public, instead electing to destroy all footage of the experiment and agreeing never to speak of the incident. Only several years later, when DARPA solicited advice from the public regarding potentially unknown bomb risks, did Savage <b>contact</b> <b>them</b> about their discovery.|$|E
25|$|Tanner had {{recently}} purchased a dirt bike, and on September 3, 2008 he rode {{into the desert}} region west of Palo Verde, California to go camping. According to Tanner's manager John Hayner, Tanner called that afternoon to say that his bike {{had run out of}} gas, and that he would accordingly walk back to his camp. Creating a suspicious death due to the military report that Tanner's bike was found at camp. Temperatures that day reached 118°F (48°C), and friends became concerned and reported Tanner missing after he failed to <b>contact</b> <b>them.</b> His body was discovered by a Marine helicopter on September 8, 2008.|$|E

25|$|During the descent, Captain Cronin ordered Flight Engineer Thomas to {{tell the}} flight attendants to prepare for an {{emergency}} landing, but Thomas was unable to <b>contact</b> <b>them</b> through the intercom. He asked the captain for permission {{to go down to}} find out what was happening, and Cronin agreed. Thomas saw severe damage immediately upon leaving the cockpit; the aircraft's skin was peeled off in some areas on the upper deck, revealing the frames and stringers. As he went down to the lower deck, the magnitude of the damage became apparent as he saw the large hole in the side of the cabin. Thomas returned to the cockpit and reported that a large section of fuselage was open aft of the Number 1 exit door. He concluded that it was probably a bomb and that, considering the damage, it would be unwise to exceed the airplane's stall speed by more than a small margin.|$|E
25|$|In survey sampling, {{many of the}} {{individuals}} identified {{as part of the}} sample may be unwilling to participate, not have the time to participate (opportunity cost), or survey administrators may {{not have been able to}} <b>contact</b> <b>them.</b> In this case, there is a risk of differences, between respondents and nonrespondents, leading to biased estimates of population parameters. This is often addressed by improving survey design, offering incentives, and conducting follow-up studies which make a repeated attempt to contact the unresponsive and to characterize their similarities and differences with the rest of the frame. The effects can also be mitigated by weighting the data when population benchmarks are available or by imputing data based on answers to other questions. Nonresponse is particularly a problem in internet sampling. Reasons for this problem include improperly designed surveys, over-surveying (or survey fatigue), and the fact that potential participants hold multiple e-mail addresses, which they don't use anymore or don't check regularly.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 the Wisconsin {{branch of}} the Labor Party took out a {{newspaper}} advertisement announcing that it had filed for an injunction to prevent the CIA, FBI, and the New York Police Department from arresting Lyndon LaRouche (then known as Lyn Marcus) or anyone involved in the movement's kidnapping of Christopher White, who had married LaRouche's former common-law wife. According to detailed descriptions by LaRouche, White had been brainwashed by the CIA and KGB to kill him. The advertisement further reported that the movement had found a cure for psychosis and encouraged mental health professionals to <b>contact</b> <b>them</b> to develop this discovery. USLP member Harley Schlanger, {{a candidate for the}} House of Representatives, sued the Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, ABC liquor board in August 1976, for prohibiting campaigning on their property, which he contended was public property. The North Carolina ACLU joined the suit. The district court judge decided that the activity was protected free speech that could not be prohibited so long as activists did not block doorways.|$|E
