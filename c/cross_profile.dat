40|$|Abstract: Material {{electromagnetic}} muldistribution {{of large}} rotors poses a potential hazard {{to the operation}} of rotary machine and interferes the vibration monitoring. These variations of electromagnetic property of material are scaled as electrical runout, which is necessary to be controlled in manufacturing process. A method of offsetting transducer difference for detecting electrical runout online is {{presented in this paper}} through finite element analysis, and the corresponding measurement system is developed for large air compressor rotors. A beam of laser with triangulation method is used to measure the surface position of the revolving rotor, which can be transformed as the non-contact distance. In the condition of static sensor probe, rotating centerline and rotary measured points on surface, actual runout of rotor is calculated through signal obtained from laser triangulation measurement. In this way, eddy current sensor, which is posed in the same plane of measuring <b>cross</b> <b>profile</b> with laser device, detects both actual runout and electrical runout as output of total indicated runout. Analyzing two signals through adjusting the phases of <b>cross</b> <b>profile</b> and offsetting the actual runout, electrical runout can be indicated in the process of lathe working. This measurement capability is useful in predicting the vibration level in the slow roll testing before product delivery. At last, the measuring experiment is performed to verify the accuracy of the system. Copyright © 2013 IFSA...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{graduation}} thesis is comparison of heights, gathered from two completely different procedures. First, by obtaining data at the field and second by obtaining data from lidar-based digital terrain model (DTM). We have focused our study on the specific melioration area at Ljubljansko barje. By using GNSS RTK-method we have determined 3 Dcoordinates of points on the overall 13 <b>cross</b> <b>profiles</b> at the field. <b>Cross</b> <b>profiles</b> were located on the two paralell melioration ditches, used for drainage and rain water run-off purposes. Since we have used RTK-method, D 96 /TM coordinates {{as well as their}} quality have been obtained and checked while measuring. To address the physical heights we had to convert ellipsoidal heights to normal-orthometric heights by the use of Slovenian geoid model. At {{the second part of the}} graduation thesis we have gained heights from the lidar DTM for every single surveyed point. Further we have compared two different sets of data on <b>cross</b> <b>profiles.</b> For this reason we have presented <b>cross</b> <b>profiles</b> graphically and evaluated the results statistically. From our study we can conclude that deviation in heights from GNSS-levelling and from lidar DTM at this particular area are significant and because of that terrain-work should be a better choice to obtain high quality data for further studies...|$|R

It has been generalized to the domain of single <b>crossing</b> preference <b>profiles</b> with respect to trees which inherits many desirable properties from the single crossing domain, for example, transitivity of majority relation, existence of polynomial time algorithms for finding winners of Kemeny voting rule, etc. In this paper, we consider a further generalization of the domain of single <b>crossing</b> <b>profiles</b> on trees to the domain consisting of all preference profiles which can be extended to single <b>crossing</b> preference <b>profiles</b> with respect to some tree by adding more preferences to it.

40|$|Abstract Background Evolutionary {{relations}} of similar segments shared by different protein folds remain controversial, {{even though many}} examples of such segments have been found. To date, {{several methods such as}} those {{based on the results of}} structure comparisons, sequence-based classifications, and sequence-based profile-profile comparisons have been applied to identify such protein segments that possess local similarities in both sequence and structure across protein folds. However, to capture more precise sequence-structure relations, no method reported to date combines structure-based profiles, and sequence-based profiles based on evolutionary information. The former are generally regarded as representing the amino acid preferences at each position of a specific conformation of protein segment. They might reflect the nature of ancient short peptide ancestors, using the results of structural classifications of protein segments. Results This report describes the development and use of "Cross Profile Analysis" to compare sequence-based profiles and structure-based profiles based on amino acid occurrences at each position within a protein segment cluster. Using systematic <b>cross</b> <b>profile</b> analysis, we found structural clusters of 9 -residue and 15 -residue segments showing remarkably strong correlation with particular sequence profiles. These correlations reflect structural similarities among constituent segments of both sequence-based and structure-based profiles. We also report previously undetectable sequence-structure patterns that transcend protein family and fold boundaries, and present results of the conformational analysis of the deduced peptide of a segment cluster. These results suggest the existence of ancient short-peptide ancestors. Conclusions <b>Cross</b> <b>profile</b> analysis reveals the polyphyletic and convergent evolution of β-hairpin-like structures, which were verified both experimentally and computationally. The results presented here give us new insights into the evolution of short protein segments. </p...|$|E

The {{compressor}} rotors {{usually are}} helical surfaces with constant pitch and are composed <b>crossing</b> <b>profiles.</b> Frequently, for repair operations occurs the reconstruction necessity {{for one or}} both of the worms, drive and driven, from the helical compressors gear. The helical composed surface of rotor flank is generated usually with side mill. The knowledge of worm shape can not be made from geometrical conditions. In these conditions it is necessary to determine the flank form by actual measuring the <b>crossing</b> <b>profiles</b> of these parts. So, the theoretical helical surface of the worm is being substituted by an assembly of helical lines which together with <b>crossing</b> <b>profiles</b> forms points cloud resulted from measuring leads to a polyhedral expression of the flank rotor. Numerically, this surface type is expressed by a coordinate array which shows its discrete image. The profiling of cutting tool bounded by a revolution surface reciprocally enveloping with the substitutive surface of the helical one represents a special problem. In this paper is proposed an algorithm for polyhedral expression of the helical surface previously determined by reverse engineering methods and an algorithm for the determination of the specific enveloping condition at contact with a discrete surface. It is presented an example for a compressor rotor measured on a 3 D measuring machine, the algorithm for the transformation of the gathered points cloud in a surface with polyhedral expression. Given these conditions there were determined the enveloping condition and the axial section of the side mill...|$|R
