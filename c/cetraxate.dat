40|$|The {{protective}} effect of an anti-ulcer agent, <b>cetraxate</b> hydrochloride [4 -(2 -carboxyethyl) phenyltrans- 4 -amino-methylcyclohexanecarboxylate hydrochloride], on the exocrine pancreas in caerulein-induced pancreatitis of rats was investigated. Hyperamylasaemia, pancreatic oedema and activation of trypsinogen in the pancreatic tissue, {{as well as}} subcellular redistribution of the lysosomal enzyme, cathepsin B, from the lysosomal fraction to the zymogen fraction, were prevented by infusion of 20 mg/kg. h <b>cetraxate</b> for 2 h before caerulein infusion and throughout the 3. 5 h of caerulein infusion (5 f. lg/kg. h). The results indicate that <b>cetraxate</b> plays its protective roles against pancreatitis by inhibiting the redistribution of lysosomal enzyme and by activation of trypsinogen; such activities may be clinically useful in preventing pancreatic injuries, particularly in patients with chronic pancreatitis...|$|E
40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{pathogenesis}} of duodenal ulcer and the mucosal protection mechanism of the duodenum, which is continuously exposed to excessive H+ in the gastric juice, the morphological alterations in Brunner's glands were observed using cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcer in rats. The results were as follows; 1) Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) -positivity and glycoprotein M 2 distribution in the Brunner's glands were markedly reduced after cysteamine administration. The dilatation and flatness of the Brunner's gland cells were also induced by cysteamine administration. These morphological alterations in the Brunner's glands were remarkably inhibited by pretreatment with secretin or <b>cetraxate.</b> 2) Electron microscopically, the apical cytoplasm of the Brunner's gland cells was filled with numerous secretory granules (SG) and the cells showed a characteristic convex appearance toward the lumen in the control group, whereas these SG remarkably decreased in number and subsequently the cells showed a concave appearance toward the lumen after cysteamine administration. Marked flatness of the Brunner's gland cells with microvilli was also demonstrated after cysteamine administration. However, no significant morphological alterations {{were found in the}} nucleus, rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (RER), Golgi's apparatus, mitochondria and other organelles. 3) Pretreatment with either secretin, somatostatin, atropine or <b>cetraxate,</b> but not with cimetidine, clearly prevented the above electron microscopic changes in the Brunner's gland cells caused by cysteamine administration. Interestingly, the SG appeared to increase in the group pretreated with somatostatin. 4) These electron microscopic findings were supported by morphometric analysis using a computerized image analyzer. Namely, %SG (ratio of the area occupied by SG to Brunner's gland cells) slightly decreased 1 hour after and significantly decreased 12 hours after cysteamine administration compared with that in the untreated group. ? 5) No significant changes in the %SG were found in the group pretreated with secretin, atropine, cimetidine 1 hour after cysteamine administration, whereas {{a significant increase in the}} %SG was found in the group pretreated with somatostatin or <b>cetraxate.</b> In addition, the reduction of the %SG seen 12 hours after cysteamine administration was significantly prevented by pretreatment with secretin, somatostatin, atropine or <b>cetraxate,</b> but was not inhibited by cimetidine. These results strongly suggested that the morphological changes in the duodenal Brunner's glands, which were confirmed by histological, immunohistological and electron microscopic observations, were associated with the pathogenesis and development of the duodenal ulcer and it was surmised that the Brunner's glands played an important role in the duodenal mucosal protection mechanism...|$|E
40|$|In {{attempt to}} clarify the {{pathogenesis}} of cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcer in rats, duodenal mucosal blood flow (DMBF) and duodenal mucosal vascular architecture were examined using hydrogen gas clearance method and intra-arterial infusion technique with India ink as a tracer. The effect of pretreatment with secretin, somatostatin, atropine, cimetidine, <b>cetraxate</b> and proglumide on the impaired duodenal microcirculation induced by cysteamine administration was also investigated. The results were as follows; 1) A significant decrease of the DMBF occurred as early as 5 min after cysteamine administration and lasted up to 60 min later, whereas no {{significant changes in the}} DMBF were found in the control group treated with saline alone. The dramatical reduction of the DMBF seemed to be in paralell with the degree of the duodenal mucosal alteration with an initial edema caused by cysteamine administration. On the other hand, cysteamine did not exert any influence on the gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF). 2) Pretreatment with either secretin, somatostatin, atropine, cimetidine or <b>cetraxate</b> significantly inhibited the reduction of the DMBF induced by cysteamine administration. In any event, these agents appeared to have beneficial effects to prevent the weakness and/or breakdown of the duodenal mucosal protection mechanism, but no similar effect was found in the group pretreated with proglumide, an antigastrin agent. 3) Intraduodenal instillation of 0. 1 N HCl did not produce an effect on the DMBF compared with that in the control group with saline administered into the duodenum. 4) Using India ink as a tracer, it was demonstrated that cysteamine induced morphological and functional changes in the duodenal mucosal microcirculation system as an early effect and that these mucosal changes were prevented by pretreatment with secretin or <b>cetraxate.</b> These results strongly suggested that the morphological and functional alterations in the duodenal? mucosal microcirculation system, which is an important mechanism of duodenal mucosal protection, might greatly be associated with the pathogenesis and development in the cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcer...|$|E
40|$|Recently, some antiulcer {{agents have}} been {{reported}} to have antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori, which is highly associated with gastritis and peptic ulcers. In-vitro and in-vivo activity of plaunotol, a cytoprotective antiulcer agent, against H. pylori was investigated. Antibacterial activity of plaunotol against a standard strain (NCTC 11637) and 14 clinical isolates was compared with those of other cytoprotective antiulcer agents: benexate, sofalcone, teprenone, <b>cetraxate,</b> and gefarnate, by an agar dilution method. The MIC » and MIC » of plaunotol against 15 strains were 6. 25 and 12. 5 mg/L, respectively, making it the most potent of the cytoprotective antiulcer agents. The bactericidal effect of plaunotol was investigated using an in-vitro killing assay. Plaunotol at concentrations of more than 6 mg/L induced a rapid reduction of culture turbidity, with an extensive loss of viability, within 30 min. Observation by scanning electron microscopy revealed that plaunotol caused autolysis and treated cells were deformed. In-vivo activity of plaunotol against H. pylori was examined in a nude mouse gastritis model. Plaunotol significantly decreased the number of H. pylori in the stomach of nude mice. In addition, the antiulcer agent enhanced the antibacterial activity of amoxycillin or clarithromycin in the infection model...|$|E
40|$|UDP-galactosyltransferase (UDP-Gal-T) is a {{key enzyme}} in the {{synthesis}} of mucus glycoprotein which {{plays an important role}} in gastric mucosal defensive mechanisms. Analysis of gastric UDP-Gal-T activity should clarify the mechanisms of the action of antiulcer drugs regarding gastric defensive factors. Here, we examined UDP-Gal-T activity in rat gastric mucosa treated with the antiulcer drugs geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) and <b>cetraxate</b> hydrochloride (CET). The effects of coadministration of indomethacin and exogenous administration of prostaglandins (PGs) were also studied. GGA and CET significantly increased UDP-Gal-T activity, and coadministration of indomethacin inhibited the increase of enzyme activity. UDP-Gal-T activity level with GGA was significantly higher than the control level, even in the presence of indomethacin. With CET, however, this was not the case. Among PGs, PGE 1 significantly increased enzyme activity. Concomitant administration of PGE 1 and GGA or CET increased UDP-Gal-T activity even with indomethacin to the levels achieved when these antiulcer drugs were administered without indomethacin. Our findings suggest that GGA and CET exert antiulcer effects by increasing mucus glycoprotein synthesis and that endogenous PG synthesis may be involved in this process. However, mechanisms not mediated by endogenous PGs may also exist in the stimulatory action of GGA on UDP-Gal-T activity. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} examine the {{pharmacological}} properties of famotidine， the potencyand selectivity of famotidine on H 2 －antagonizing activity， and the mechanismsfor the gastric mucosal protection by famotidine were investigated and mainlycompared with those of cimetidine． ln addition， the effects of famotidine andcimetidine on cardiovascular and bronchial functions， and pharmacokinetic druginteractions with muscle relaxant and narcotics were also examined． 1 ． Famotidine inhibited the depressor response to dimaprit in anesthetized dogsand the hypersecretory response to histamine in stomach－perfused， anesthetizedrats． Famotidine was 166 times more potent than cimetidine in the former test and 108 times more so in the latter one． 2 ． The development of gastric lesions produced by taurocholate－histamine andhemorrhage－histamine was dose－dependently inhibited by famotidine at doses ofwhich suppressed histamine－induced acid secretion in pylorus－ligated rats． 3 ． Famotidine also prevented gastric mucosal lesions induced by taurocholateserotonin， HCI－aspirin， HCI-ethanol and iodoacetamide all of which concern the damage of the mucosal defensive factors in rats． Cimetidine， pirenzepine and <b>cetraxate</b> showed the inhibitory effects on almost all types of the gastric lesions but their inhibitory effects were much less potent than those of famotidine． The inhibitory effects of famotidine and cimetidine on HCI－ethanol-evoked mucosal lesion were not influenced by pretreatment with indomethacin． 4 ． Famotidine and cimetidine inhibited the decreases in gastric mucosal blood flow caused by hemorrhage and by HCI-ethanol and {{the reduction of the}} mucosal contents of glycoprotein induced by water immersion restraint stress． These H 2 -antagonists also increased the transfer of bicarbonate into the gastric lumen． Furthermore， famotidine， but not cimetidine， was effective in increasing the transgastric potential difference(PD) and promoted the recovery of decreased transgastric PD induced by HCI-ethanol in rats． 5 ． Famotidine did not affect cardiovascular and bronchial functions in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital or the mixture of a combination of halothane，nitrous oxide and oxygen， and did not produce any pharmacokinetic drug interactions with hexobarbital and muscle relaxants． On the contrary， cimetidine significantly prolonged the sleeping times induced by hexobarbital in mice in addition to causing the decreases in heart rate， blood pressure， cardiac contractility and coronary blood flow in dogs． No hemodynamic changes wereobserved after famotidine in dogs whose cardiac function was depressed by propranolol. 6 ． These results indicate that famotidine is a competitive and selective H 2 －receptor antagonist． The preventive effects of famotidine on gastric lesions in rats is thought to be attributable not only to suppress acid secretion but also to activate the gastric rnucosal defensive mechanisms． lt is， furthermore，suggested that famotidine is far superior to cimetidine because of its potent H 2 -antagonizing， antisecretory and antiulcer activities besides its negligible effects on cardiovascular and bronchial functions, and pharmacokinetic drug interactions...|$|E
