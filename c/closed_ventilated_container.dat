40|$|Abstract The European earwig (Forficula auricularia) is {{potentially}} a predator {{of a number}} of insect pests in apple orchards. However, its effectiveness as a natural enemy in apple orchards may be compromised by insecticide sprays. A laboratory bioassay of eight insecticides currently used in Integrated Fruit Production (IFP) apple orchards and one as-yet unregistered product was undertaken to determine their effects on earwigs. Adult earwigs were placed in <b>ventilated</b> <b>containers</b> where they were exposed to insecticide residues on apple leaves and monitored on four occasions over 10 days. Indoxacarb, thiacloprid, spinosad and diazinon caused the greatest mortality to earwigs while carbaryl appeared to be less harmful. Chlorantraniliprole, spirotetramat, emamectin benzoate and methoxyfenozide caused no increased mortality of earwigs compared with the control. Identification and avoidance of harmful insecticides may help to enhance the potential of earwigs as natural enemies in apple orchards...|$|R

In this review, we synthesise and discuss the microclimate impacts of passive warming chambers (<b>closed,</b> <b>ventilated</b> and Open Top Chamber [...] OTC) commonly used in Antarctic terrestrial habitats, paying special attention to seasonal warming, during the growing season and outside, extreme temperatures and freeze-thaw events. Both temperature increases and decreases were recorded throughout the year. Closed chambers caused earlier spring soil thaw (8 - 28 days) while OTCs delayed soil thaw (3 - 13 days). Smaller closed chamber types recorded the largest temperature extremes (up to 20 C higher than ambient) and longest periods (up to 11 h) of above ambient extreme temperatures, and even OTCs had above ambient temperature extremes over up to 5 consecutive hours. The frequency of freeze-thaw events was reduced by * 25 %. All chamber types experienced extreme temperature ranges that could negatively affect biological responses, while warming during winter could result in depletion of limited metabolic resources. The effects outside the growing season could be as important in driving biological responses as the mean summer warming.

Containers were fastened to a rope suspended {{from the top of}} the silo at depths of 0 m (just under the top manhole), 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m (silo floor). When the highest temperature achieved was ≍ 50 °C for 6 h, parental mortality of R. dominica and T. castaneum, and both psocid species was 98 - 100 %. Progeny production of R. dominica occurred when there was parental survival, but in general R. dominica seemed less impacted by the heat treatment than T. castaneum. There was 100 % mortality of L. corrodens at all depths in the heat treatments but only 92. 5 % mortality for L. decolor, with most survivors located in the bioassay containers at the top of the silo.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{identify}} the thermal functions of internal courtyards in traditional Chinese shophouses (CSHs) located in the hot-humid climate of Malaysia with the aim of providing useful passive cooling strategies for modern urban houses. The CSHs are deep-plan brick row houses that are located in relatively dense urban areas. First, this paper empirically analyses the effects of courtyard forms on their indoor thermal environments based on the results of field experiments conducted in 16 CSHs in the city of Malacca in 2011 and 2014. Second, this paper investigates the detailed thermal environments of the selected two traditional CSHs with different courtyard types to discuss the thermal functions of courtyards. It was determined that air temperatures in internal courtyards can be explained using the sky view factor, the height of the courtyard and the difference in the heights of the building and walls that form the courtyard. The courtyard forms that characterized their thermal environments were classified into five types and the different types of courtyards performed different functions with respect to improving the indoor thermal comfort in the CSHs.

40|$|Green {{bell peppers}} (Capsicum annuum cv. Cardio) were stored in open crates at 5 degreesC, using a novel system for {{maintenance}} of relative humidity (RH). A hollow fiber membrane contactor allowed adequate transfer of water vapor between {{the air in}} the storage room and a liquid desiccant. The membrane was made of polyetherimide (PEI), coated on the inside with a thin non-porous silicone layer. The desiccant was a dilute aqueous glycerol solution, which was pumped through the hollow fibers at a low flow rate. Produce was placed in <b>ventilated</b> 5001 <b>containers</b> with a closed lid. During the 3 weeks of the experiment, RH could be maintained within a narrow range each day (e. g. 90. 5 +/- 0. 1 %). RH could be changed by adjusting the glycerol concentration and/or the temperature of the desiccant. The control was a 5501 container connected to the hollow fiber membrane set up which had no glycerol solution (average RH 93 %). The contactor thus removed water vapor in this set up. The quality of the bell peppers (visible peel shrivelling and fungus development), after 3 weeks of storage, was highly dependent on RH. Compared with the control container and with packaging in conventional cardboard boxes for bell peppers (average RH 86 %), the contactor system reduced fungus development without increasing shrivelling. The improvement compared with cardboard boxes was presumably due to reduction of local differences in RH. Such differences were avoided in the containers where the packaging was very open (open crates, with space in between them, and only two layers of fruit) and where the airflow was rather high. In preliminary experiments with red currants and pears the contactor system also functioned well (a) at subzero temperatures, (b) when it was combined with controlled atmosphere (7. 5 % oxygen and 20 % carbon dioxide), or (c) when it released water vapor. It is concluded that the system is promising for the large-scale storage of several fresh commodities. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|There is {{nowadays}} more awareness on {{the impact}} on health of pollutants emitted even during cooking both from commercial {{as well as from}} domestic activities. Cooking processes like frying, roasting, grilling, boiling and broiling, contribute to emissions of pollutants, particularly in <b>closed,</b> poorly <b>ventilated</b> areas where air quality is deeply influenced on their presence 1. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a large group of carbon-based chemicals that easily evaporate at room temperature, but while some VOCs are odorous, many of them can not be detected by our senses, even if their inhalation may be associated with health risks 2. Thus, given the importance of monitoring VOCs emissions during cooking activities, the objective {{of this study is to}} set up and assess the applicability of a new system allowing to analyse these compounds. In order to address this task, air samples obtained from different cooking techniques, were sampled in olfactometric bags and analyzed using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS). The bag allows to transport the sample to the instrument location and to perform the SPME extraction of the sampled air. Despite several applications have been developed in different field, this kind of sampling system combined to SPME-GC-MS, has never been exploited to study the emissions of VOCs formed during cooking and based on the first results, it seems to be successful to this purpose.

40|$|Problems {{of quality}} {{maintenance}} are {{encountered in the}} marine transport from tropical and sub-tropical to temperate climatic zones, of hygroscopic durable foods such as cocoa beans and similar commodities, particularly in winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Cargoes frequently display damaging mould formation and insect infestation on unloading. This publication indicates {{the likelihood of the}} incidence of these problems for different modes of transport by ship (bulk, bag and box container). Interpretations are based upon the principles of heat and moisture transfer and experimental observations of several shipments. The mould problem is usually interpreted as arising from the migration of moisture from the interior of the cargo to its sides. It occurs when a temperature difference develops between the cargo interior and the frame of the ship's hold. With bulk commodities, the moisture problem can occur at the sides of the cargo if this is in direct contact with the sides of the ship. With bagged commodities, similar difficulties can arise, but they are less pronounced because of the beneficial effect of air circulation around the bags, particularly if dunnage is present. For box-container transport, the major risk of quality deterioration occurs in winter following offloading on the dockside. Dew can rapidly form {{on the underside of the}} container roof, and 'internal raining' with subsequent wetting and mould formation can occur with the associated risk of mycotoxin production. Closed box containers present the greatest hazard. Naturally <b>ventilated</b> and open-sided <b>containers</b> together with suitable modifications to handling practices are considered to be more suitable for the avoidance of this problem.

The objective {{of this study was to}} mathematically model this system with respect to onion bulb temperature and weight loss, and internal container air temperature and relative humidity. These product and flowfield variables were predicted at different locations within the transport vessel. Bulb temperature and weight loss were simulated as dynamic variables using ordinary differential equations, and air temperature and relative humidity were simulated as quasi steady state variables using algebraic equations. A validation experiment was conducted to evaluate the simulation model by placing temperature and humidity sensors throughout the product and flowfield space measuring the respective properties. Onion and air temperatures were predicted with satisfactory accuracy in almost all measured locations of the container. Prediction of relative humidity varied considerably throughout the container, although excessive sensor errors were identified casting suspicion on some validation measurements. Simulated relative humidity could not therefore be fully verified. Bulb weight loss was predicted with variable levels of accuracy. Significant variability in the validation data was evident in the upper and lower regions of the container preventing complete model validation. Central regions of the container were simulated with satisfactory accuracy. A model sensitivity analysis revealed that container ventilation rate strongly influenced model performance with respect to temperature and relative humidity.

Silicate fluxes were positively related to the dry weight ofworms and to the number of tubes in sediments when they consisted of either Eupolymnia tubes or artificially irrigated tubes alone. However when tube types were mixed (Eupolymnia + artificially irrigated tubes), silicate Auxcs were lower than in sediments containing arti-ficially ventilated tubes alone.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the XXXIII IAHS World Congress on Housing, 27 - 30 September 2005,"Transforming Housing Environments through Design", University of Pretoria. This paper would look into typology of external decks in collective housing, its advantages and shortcomings, its relationship to current building regulations in Croatia and into the appearance of this typology in the recent housing realizations in Croatia. According to some authors the external deck in collective housing {{as a way of}} connecting individual dwelling units, first appeared in USA, though already in the Middle Ages many European collective housing was based on the same model. This type of collective housing building is a result of a more economic way of bringing together dwelling units into a single entity by reducing the number of staircases. The length of this external deck is mainly defined by fire regulations stipulating the maximum distance between the dwelling entrance and the staircase (this usually being 30 meters). This dwelling type includes many sub-types : two-storey(maisonnettes) and three-storey dwellings, type with raised or lowered decks, detached decks etc. External deck typology could show its advantages as shortcomings and vice versa. Most commonly mentioned economic advantage of this type- reduced number of vertical communication per dwelling (a large number of dwellings per one horizontal circulation area) could turn into a shortcoming if the solution results in the lack of privacy of rooms orientated onto this communal connection of dwelling units. The advantage of this type resulting in some solutions in the individualization of dwellings (effect of a “house with garden”) is often followed by the increased construction costs due to greater number of outer walls than this is the case in other types of collective housing. The POS (State Subsidized Housing) regulations in Croatia “do not recommend to designers the use of deck system because of larger circulation areas and defficient economic parameter. In the case of the deck solution only a <b>closed</b> and <b>ventilated</b> deck with two-storey and three-storey dwellings is recommended” The paradox of the existing situation in Croatia {{lies in the fact that}} the great number of realized (and prized) collective housing is of the external deck typology. The main reason probably lies in the possibilities of this type to offer “radically more meaningful approach” introducing into collective housing a semblance of individual dwelling followed by well known advantages of the external deck typology.

All received assist-mode NIMV (average 12 h / day) via oronasal masks (inspiratory pressure 10 - 25 cm H 2 O, expiratory pressure 4 - 6 cm H 2 O) to maintain O 2 saturation at 90 - 95 %. Treatment was supervised by an experienced pulmonologist, who had also provided specific training in NIMV for medical and nursing staffs (90 -day course followed by periodic refresher sessions). Arterial blood pressure, O 2 saturation, and respiratory rate were continuously monitored during NIMV. Based on baseline arterial pH, the COPD was classified as moderate (7. 25 - 7. 34) or severe (< 7. 25). Results: In patients with moderate and severe COPD, significant improvements were seen in arterial pH after 2 (p < 0. 05) and 24 h (p< 0. 05) of NIMV and in the PaC 02 after 24 hours (p < 0. 05). Four (15 %) of the 27 patients died during the study hospitalization (in-hospital mortality 15 %), in 2 cases due to NIMV failure. For the other 23, mean long-term survival was 14. 5 months (95 % CI 10. 2 to 18. 8), and {{no significant differences were found}} between the moderate and severe groups. Over half (61 %) the patients were alive 1 year after admission. Conclusions: NIMV can be a cost-effective option for management of moderate or severe COPD on a general medicine ward. Its proper use requires: <b>close</b> monitoring of <b>ventilated</b> subjects, optimum staff:patient ratio, well-trained staff dedicated to NIMV, and supervision by a pulmonologist with experience in NIMV. The treatment was effective at improving arterial blood gases in both groups of COPD patients. The severity of the COPD did not significantly affect length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, or long-term survival...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{development}} in many Third World {{countries in the}} hot regions of the world,, have been accompanied by the construction of highly energy-wasteful buildings. The interiors of these buildings have to be mechanically airconditioned {{in order to achieve}} thermal-comfort conditions. The consequence of this, has been the rapid increase in electricity-generating plant capacity to match demand (of which, for example at present in Oman, more than 70 % nationally is used for air-conditioning modern, energyinefficient buildings). The aim of this work was to find the most suitable way of stabilising or even reducing the electricity demand in a country like Oman. The first step taken to achieve this aim, was to study and draw out lessons from the vernacular architecture of the different climatic regions in Oman. This has been followed by a literature survey that looks at passive and active natural cooling techniques for buildings in hot climates. Mathematical models were then developed to analyze and compare those passive techniques that are most suitable for an environment like that of Oman. Different ways of reducing the heat gain through the roof were investigated and compared. These include the addition of insulation, shading, air-cooling of the roof when the ambient air temperature is lower than that of the roof, and roof ponds. Roof ponds were found to be the most effective of those techniques analyzed. An improved design of the roof pond (the Water Diode roof pond) that eliminates the need for covering the roof pond during the day and uncovering it at night, was suggested and analyzed. The analysis showed promising results. Mathematical models were also developed to analyze and compare dif f erent ways of reducing the heat gain through the walls. These included the use of <b>closed</b> cavities, naturally <b>ventilated</b> cavities, the addition of insulation, and the effect of using brick as compared to concrete block. The analysis suggested that the combination of a Water Diode roof pond and insulated brick wall construction will reduce the heat gain through the envelope of a single room by more than 90 %, when compared to a room with un-insulated roof and single-leaf concrete block walls. An empirical validation of the mathematical models was conducted. The results showed a good agreement between the actual and predicted values. An economical analysis of the commonly used roof and wall constructions in Oman, was also conducted. This compared the life-cycle cost of nine different construction techniques, with eight different airconditioning schedules. The result of this analysis showed a clear advantage of using roof insulation, reflective double glazing, and insulated walls with brick outer-leaf and concrete block inner-leaf...|$|R
