25|$|The Jack I. and Dorothy G. Bender Library and Learning Resources Center is {{the main}} library {{facility}} for the campus. A branch Music Library {{is located in the}} Katzen Art Center. The Pence Law Library, part of AU's Washington College of Law, operates separately from the main library system. The University Library is part of the Washington Research Library Consortium (WRLC), which includes seven other libraries. The WRLC operates a <b>consortium</b> <b>loan</b> service between member institutions and has a shared collections site in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.|$|E

30|$|An {{additional}} limitation {{can be found}} in the lack of parasitism in the UBG alliances. A wide variety of economic phenomena fall under the category of parasitism, such as joint research and development projects, joint ventures in a foreign country, and <b>consortium</b> <b>loans</b> and recovery of funds. In future studies, new insights regarding the conflicting dimensions of cooperative strategy will be examined using the construct of parasitism. These are the limitations of our paper, and future research will be able to expand our analysis.|$|R
50|$|The {{total cost}} of the bridge was about €630 million, funded by Greek state funds, the <b>consortium</b> and <b>loans</b> by the European Investment Bank. It was {{finished}} ahead of its original schedule, which had foreseen completion between September and November 2004, and within budget. Other sources talk about €839 million.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the results of}} the authors’ research study on one <b>consortium’s</b> interlibrary <b>loan</b> practices on returnable items. Local practices and policies that appear to have affected other member libraries are included. The audience will consider whether this analysis identifies concerns that they should investigate with their own consortium partners. The group as a whole can then begin to explore how significant this issue might be on a national scale; whether these issues might be prevalent enough to warrant a broader analysis; and what solutions might be starting points for discussion...|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the {{government}} sold two tranches of the mortgage-style loans to investors. Firstly in 1998 to Greenwich NatWest raising £1bn, and secondly in 1999 to Deutsche Bank and the Nationwide Building Society, also raising £1bn. The SLC's remaining mortgage-style loans, for which payments were mostly in arrears, {{were sold to}} a <b>consortium,</b> Erudio Student <b>Loans,</b> in 2013 for £160m. In 2014, the government indicated that it would start selling the SLC's £12bn book of 1998 - 2012 ICR loans to improve the UK public finances.|$|R
5000|$|In 1922, Wilhelm Hansen {{suffered}} a massive financial and personal loss. [...] "Landmandsbanken", {{in which the}} <b>Consortium</b> had taken <b>loans</b> {{for the purchase of}} art works, collapsed. In order to pay off his debt Wilhelm Hansen sold more than half of his French collection - approximately 82 pieces. Among these were important works by Paul Cézanne, Édouard Manet and Paul Gauguin. Many of these works are now housed at the [...] "Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek" [...] in Copenhagen and [...] "The National Museum of Western Art" [...] in Tokyo. Wilhelm Hansen overcame the crisis and from 1923 to 1933 compensated for his losses by buying new, specifically French paintings, which are still at Ordrupgaard.|$|R
40|$|Life-cycle {{orientation}} is a driver of economical, ecological and social sustainability in three main ways. First, the optimization of life-cycle cost instead of investment cost usually leads to cost savings {{in the long}} run and thus economical sustainability. Second, the economical sustainability is linked to ecological sustainability via the likes of energy costs. For example, the level of current and future energy costs justifies higher initial investments for energy and thus cost saving. Third, the social sustainability of the infrastructure's users is influenced by the design of the operation, maintenance and replacement processes over the infrastructure's life time. Life-cycle {{orientation is}} a key element of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects. PPP procurement is usually an alternative to traditional procurement. In theory, PPP is pursued if the Public Sector Comparator indicates that PPP generates efficiency gains leading to cost savings over the life-cycle in comparison with traditional procurement. In practice, PPP is often used by the public client as a mean to finance the initial investment. In this case, the initial investment will be provided by the private <b>consortium</b> using <b>loans</b> and private equity. The funding is provided either by users or by the public authorities with an availability payment during the contractual operation period. Therefore risk management of such life-cycle-oriented projects is an essential success factor to achieve the intended life-cycle optimization and/or alternative financing. The findings of this chapter provide a thorough theoretical grounding for the specific case study findings discussed by Jefferies and McGeorge in Chapter 9...|$|R
60|$|There is, however, {{very little}} {{hope that the}} {{decisions}} reached by the Washington Conference will permanently benefit China, and a considerable chance that they may do quite the reverse. In Manchuria {{the status quo is}} to be maintained, while in Shantung the Japanese have made concessions, the value of which only time can show. The Four Powers--America, Great Britain, France, and Japan--have agreed to exploit China in combination, not competitively. There is a <b>consortium</b> as regards <b>loans,</b> which will have the power of the purse and will therefore be the real Government of China. As the Americans are the only people who have much spare capital, they will control the consortium. As they consider their civilization the finest in the world, they will set to work to turn the Chinese into muscular Christians. As the financiers are the most splendid feature of the American civilization, China must be so governed as to enrich the financiers, who will in return establish colleges and hospitals and Y.M.C.A.'s throughout the length and breadth of the land, and employ agents to buy up the artistic treasures of China for sepulture in their mansions. Chinese intellect, like that of America, will be, directly or indirectly, in the pay of the Trust magnates, and therefore no effective voice will be, raised in favour of radical reform. The inauguration of this system will be welcomed even by some Socialists in the West as a great victory for peace and freedom.|$|R
