500|$|The {{frontman}} {{was more}} involved in the composition of Born Villain than he was for preceding records. Manson has said that this is a result of him beginning the project with a different mindset from that of his chief collaborator, Twiggy. He said he developed a [...] "clear idea" [...] of the album's direction early in its writing stages, which he was reluctant to share {{with other members of the}} band. He worked on the album in a minimally decorated apartment located above a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles, which was once owned by actor Billy Zane and was the site where Manson created his first painting in 1996. The album contains seven songs which feature the vocalist as a composer, including three where he is listed as the sole writer. At the time of the album's release, Manson distanced himself from the approach he took when creating previous albums, explaining: [...] "On the last two records I made, I was trying to make people feel what I was feeling—which wasn't a good idea, because I was feeling like shit. <b>Check</b> <b>mark</b> number one: don't make records that make people feel bad." ...|$|E

50|$|There are {{two ways}} that Speechranks {{measures}} student participation: Points and Green <b>Check</b> <b>Marks.</b> Points are awarded to competitors based on the student’s percentile finish in each event. Students achieving the same percentile finish in any event and any tournament will be awarded {{the same number of}} Points. A student’s three best finishes in a particular event are used to sum their total Points for that event. Overall ranking on Speechranks is determined {{by the total number of}} Points a competitor has accumulated. Green <b>Check</b> <b>Marks</b> recognize consistent excellence throughout the competitive season. There is no limit to the number of Green <b>Check</b> <b>Marks</b> a student may earn. In general, Green <b>Check</b> <b>Marks</b> are awarded to any competitor who achieves a winning record in debate or finishes in the top 40% of an individual event (IE). Green <b>Check</b> <b>Marks</b> are unique to each event and students may not transfer checkmarks from one event to another. Speechranks requirements were drafted by Isaiah McPeak, with development chaired by Dr. Van Schalin and programmed by Connor McKay. It utilizes the Ruby Programming Language, the same language Stoa uses for membership and tournament registration.|$|R

2500|$|The ICD-10 {{established}} {{a set of}} diagnostic criteria for PCS in 1992.

2500|$|The DSM-IV lists {{criteria}} for diagnosis of PCD {{in people who}} have suffered a head trauma with persistent post-traumatic amnesia, loss of consciousness, or post-traumatic seizures. In addition, for a diagnosis of PCD, patients must have neuropsychological impairment {{as well as at}} least three of the symptoms marked with a <b>check</b> <b>mark</b> in the table at right under [...] "DSM-IV". These symptoms must be present for threemonths after the injury and must have been absent or less severe before the injury. In addition, the patient must experience social problems as a result, and must not meet {{criteria for}} another disorder that explains the symptoms better.|$|E
2500|$|In online messaging, a slash {{might be}} used to imitate the {{formatting}} of a chat command (e.g., writing [...] "/fliptable" [...] as though there were such a command) or the closing tags of languages such as HTML (e.g., writing [...] "/endrant" [...] to end an ironic diatribe or [...] "/s" [...] to mark the preceding text as sarcastic). A pair of slashes is sometimes used as a way to mark italic text, where no special formatting is available (e.g., /italics/). A single slash is sometimes used as a way of expressing a <b>check</b> <b>mark,</b> with the meaning [...] "OK", [...] "got it", [...] "done", or [...] "thanks". In Japan, a set of multiple forward slashes (typically three: ///) is used to convey shyness or embarrassment, owing to the way blushing is depicted in manga.

2500|$|During {{the first}} four {{audition}} rounds (episodes 1-4), only the jury could decide who would continue to the semi-finals. [...] At any time during a performance, {{each member of the}} jury could push on one of two buttons: a green <b>check</b> <b>mark</b> of approval or a red X for disapproval. [...] When a member of the jury pressed one of the buttons, a loud sound effect let the contestant know that a member of the jury had made a decision and what the decision was. [...] If a contestant received three red X's before the end of their performance, that contestant was eliminated and their performance was abruptly stopped. Sometimes, however, an eliminated contestant could convince the jury to allow them to complete their performance. To continue to the semi-finals, a contestant needed to gain at least two green check marks from the jury. If more than 6 contestants were given 2 or more green check marks in a single program, the jury would decide {{at the end of the}} program which 6 contestants would continue to the semi-finals. Those who continued to the semi-finals were not necessarily the ones that had received three check marks. Sometimes, the jury chose contestants with only two check marks over contestants that had been given three check marks.|$|E

5000|$|An x mark (also {{known as}} a cross, x, ex, exmark or into mark) is a mark (x, ×, X, ✕, ☓, ✖, ✗, ✘, etc.) used to {{indicate}} the concept of negation (for example [...] "no, {{this has not been}} verified" [...] or [...] "no, I don't agree") as well as an indicator (for example in election ballot papers or in x marks the spot). Its opposite is often considered to be the <b>check</b> <b>mark</b> or tick (or the O mark used in Japan, Korea and Taiwan). In Japanese, the X mark (×) is called [...] "batsu" [...] (ばつ) and can be expressed by someone by crossing their arms.In some areas it's common for people to check a square box with a cross rather than a <b>check</b> <b>mark,</b> while in others the <b>check</b> <b>mark</b> (✓) or even a v mark is used.|$|E
