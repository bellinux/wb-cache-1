2500|$|On taking office, Obama {{called for}} a [...] "reset" [...] in {{relations}} with Russia, which had declined following the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. While President Bush had successfully pushed for NATO expansion into former Eastern bloc states, the early Obama era saw NATO put more of an emphasis on creating a long-term partnership with Russia. Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev worked together on a new treaty to reduce and monitor nuclear weapons, Russian accession to the World Trade Organization, and counterterrorism. On April 8, 2010, Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty, a major nuclear arms control agreement that reduced the nuclear weapons stockpiles of both countries and provided for a monitoring regime. In December 2010, the Senate ratified New START in a 71-26 vote, with 13 Republicans and all Democrats voting {{in favor of the}} treaty. In 2012, Russia joined the World Trade Organization and Obama normalized trade relations with Russia. However, US-Russia relations declined once Vladimir Putin returned to the presidency. Russia's intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea led to a strong condemnation by Obama and other Western leaders, who imposed sanctions on Russian leaders. The sanctions contributed to a Russian financial crisis. Some members of Congress from both parties also called for the US to arm Ukrainian forces, but Obama resisted becoming closely involved in the War in Donbass. In 2016, following several <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>incidents,</b> the Obama administration formally accused Russia of engaging in a campaign to undermine the 2016 election, and the administration imposed sanctions on some Russian-linked people and organizations.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe National Cyber Incident Response Plan stipulates the state homeland security advisor as the contact {{point for a}} significant cyber incident. But {{this may not be}} the most effective method of response because the state homeland security advisors are not domain experts for cyberspace. A questionnaire was sent to state chief information officers and/or state chief information security officers to determine current capability and procedures for responding to a national <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>incident.</b> Nineteen states replied with 227 responses relating to information sharing between states and the federal government; use of established cybersecurity event and response definitions, coordination and control mechanisms, and terms; use of risk-based approaches to cyber incident planning, including remediation based on workflows and procedures; establishment of thresholds when predefined boundaries are crossed; and instigation of varying courses of action. As a result of the survey, the author recommends increasing knowledge and information flow between state and federal agencies regarding national cyber incidents; the establishment of regional cybersecurity hubs throughout the nation; and the creation of a national cyber incident teleconferencing network and prearranged protocols for situational awareness and communication of courses of action following a <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>incident.</b> Director Operations and Planning, DHS Office of Cybersecurity and Communication...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of Web technologies has driven a broad implementation of network-based {{applications in the}} financial industry, as well as resulted {{in a variety of}} cyber risks throughout the domain. As one of the risk management solutions, cybersecurity insurance (CI) is an alternative solution for dealing with cybersecurity risk in the financial industry by transferring some of the risk burden to an insurance company. It has become a popular approach for compensating some of the financial loses of cybersecurity events. ^ However, the cost of cybersecurity insurance also leads to a heavy financial burden, which also affects risk mitigations when it is applied. The major problem is the difficulty of maximizing insurance returns by selecting insured items in terms of their demands under the certain financial budget. ^ The problem of the research is to find an adaptive approach for financial service institutions to achieve an efficient and effective cybersecurity risks transfer by using cybersecurity insurance under a firm financial budget. The difficulties address few aspects, including understanding cyber incidents and their threats levels, cognizing the relationships between cyber <b>incidents,</b> <b>cybersecurity</b> insurance items, and making decisions on selecting insurance items considering both financial costs and insurance demands. ^ To address the issues above, this dissertation concentrates on the problem of maximizing the cybersecurity insurance returns in terms of the available funds. ^ The main contributions of this work are threefold; First, we perform feasibility study starting with proposing a novel secure big data cyber incident analytics framework based on the survey, which is designed to produce a strategy map for implementing cybersecurity insurance under a certain financial constraint; second, we develop an approach using cyber incident classification for ontology-based knowledge representation, which is supported by semantic cyber incident classification model; finally, we create a new approach of risk prediction model based on decision tree method for information classification. ^ The research solves the problem of cybersecurity insurance plan generation by developing a cost reduction strategy with Greedy algorithm run through two rounds of greedy to obtain cost effective plan with higher cyber risk weight. We implement experimental evaluations to prove the effectiveness and performances and the results show that our proposed framework and models are feasible for practical deployments. ...|$|R

40|$|There are {{increasing}} obligations on companies to report <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>incidents</b> to {{national and international}} regulators. Article 13 a of the Telecoms Directive (2009 / 140 /EC) requires network service providers to report significant security breaches and losses of integrity to competent national authorities. The United States Security and Exchange Commission also expects its members to file information about cyber incidents. Existing cyber-incident reporting systems, typically, use tools and techniques that were initially intended to support Safety Management Systems, including reconstruction and causal analysis. This unified approach is particularly useful when, for example, {{the consequences of a}} cyber attack might compromise safety. In contrast, this paper identifies differences that complicate the use of conventional safety reporting techniques to mitigate cyber threats. For instance, it is important to communicate safety lessons as widely as possible to avoid any recurrence of previous accidents. However, disclosing the details of a security incident can expose vulnerabilities or assets that motivate further attacks. Similarly, most safety-management systems have clear reporting mechanisms via industry regulators. This is far more complicated for security incidents where companies have to report both to national industry regulators and to national telecoms authorities. They may also have to contact local and national law enforcement, to Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and to national infrastructure protection agencies. At a more technical level, the counterfactual arguments that are often used to distinguish causes and contextual factors in safety related accidents cannot easily be used to reason about the malicious causes of security incidents. The closing sections of this paper propose a research agenda that is urgently required before the proposed EC Network and Information Security Directive (COM 2013 / 48) extends the Article 13 a reporting obligations across all European critical infrastructure providers...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} in industrial security analysisthat the security risk faced by an organization is afunction {{of both the}} likelihood of successful attack against an asset and the consequence of such an attack. The second variable, consequence, while highly site-specific, is generally the easiest to understand. Often it can be estimated in terms of financial loss, acute health effects, or environmental impacts—concepts well understood from years of safety analysis of hazardous processes. Estimating the likelihood of successful attack is far more difficult. According to American Institute of Chemical Engineers guidelines, it {{is a function of}} three additional variables: Threat: Any indication, circumstance, or event with the potential to cause the loss of, or damage to an asset Vulnerabilities: Any weakness that an adversary can exploit to gain access to an asset Target attractiveness: An estimate of the value of a tar-get to an adversary These terms are more difficult to estimate, particu-larly with respect to cybersecurity. This difficultly is largely because we have little reli-able historical or statistical data to work with. The details of safety-related incidents have gone on record for over a century, while <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>incidents</b> have less than two decades of occurrence, never mind record keeping. Furthermore, most organizations are highly reluctant to report security incidents as they can cause embar-rassment to the company. In fact, many organizations have denied that there even is a risk to industrial sys-tems from cyber attack. For example, an article in CIO magazine entitled “Debunking the Threat to Water Utilities”stated there was no credible risk to superviso-ry control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems from a network-based attack: “Most public utilities rely on a highly customized SCADA system. No two are the same, so hacking them requires specific knowledge. ” Yet this {{flies in the face of}} a number of well-docu-mented cyber-related incidents such as the Slammer Worm infiltration of an Ohio nuclear plant and several power utilities and the wireless attack on a sewag...|$|E
