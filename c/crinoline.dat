5|$|Petticoats made of {{horsehair}} <b>crinoline</b> appeared around 1839, proving {{so successful}} that the name 'crinoline' began to refer to supportive petticoats in general, rather than solely to the material. By 1847, <b>crinoline</b> fabric was {{being used as a}} stiffening for skirt linings, although English women preferred separate <b>crinoline</b> fabric petticoats which were beginning to collapse under the increasing weight of the skirts. One alternative to horsehair <b>crinoline</b> was the quilted petticoat stuffed with down or feathers, such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by Lady Aylesbury. However, quilted skirts were not widely produced until the early 1850s. In about 1849, it was possible to buy stiffened and corded cotton fabric for making petticoats, marketed as 'crinoline,' and designed as a substitute for the horsehair textile. The artificial <b>crinoline</b> with hoops did not emerge until the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{just before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II, there was {{a revival of the}} hooped <b>crinoline</b> from designers such as Edward Molyneux, who put hoops in both day skirts and evening gowns, and Norman Hartnell, whose late 1930s Winterhalter-inspired <b>crinoline</b> designs for Queen Elizabeth were so successful that the Queen is popularly (if inaccurately) credited with having single-handedly brought crinolines back into fashion. Both as Queen, and as the Queen Mother, Elizabeth adopted the traditional bell-shaped <b>crinoline</b> as her signature look for evening wear and state occasions. The film Gone With The Wind, released in 1939, inspired the American fashion for prom dresses with crinolines in Spring 1940.|$|E
5|$|The steel-hooped cage <b>crinoline,</b> first {{patented}} in April 1856 by R.C. Milliet in Paris, and {{by their}} agent in Britain a few months later, became extremely popular. Steel cage crinolines were mass-produced in huge quantity, with factories across the Western world producing tens of thousands in a year. Alternative materials, such as whalebone, cane, gutta-percha and even inflatable caoutchouc (natural rubber) were all used for hoops, although steel was the most popular. At its widest point, the <b>crinoline</b> could reach a circumference of up to six yards, although by the late 1860s, crinolines were beginning to reduce in size. By the early 1870s, the smaller crinolette and the bustle had largely replaced the <b>crinoline.</b>|$|E

5|$|Other risks {{associated}} with the <b>crinoline</b> were that it could get caught in other people's feet, carriage wheels or furniture, or be caught by sudden gusts of wind, blowing the wearer off their feet. In 1859, while participating in a paper chase, Louisa, Duchess of Manchester, caught her hoop while climbing over a stile, and was left with the entirety of her <b>crinoline</b> and skirts thrown over her head, revealing her scarlet drawers to the assembled company.|$|E
5|$|The <b>crinoline</b> {{was worn}} by some factory workers, {{leading to the}} {{textiles}} firm Courtaulds instructing female employees in 1860 to leave their hoops and crinolines at home. Cunnington described seeing a photograph of female employees in the Bryant and May match factories wearing crinolines while at work. A report in The Cork Examiner of 2 June 1864 recorded the death of Ann Rollinson from injuries sustained after her <b>crinoline</b> was caught by a revolving machinery shaft in a mangling room at Firwood bleach works.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s {{the term}} <b>crinoline</b> was more usually {{applied to the}} fashionable {{silhouette}} provided by horsehair petticoats, and to the hoop skirts that replaced them in the mid-1850s. In form and function these hoop skirts were similar to the 16th- and 17th-century farthingale and to 18th-century panniers, in that they too enabled skirts to spread even wider and more fully.|$|E

5|$|The cage <b>crinoline</b> {{made out}} of spring steel wire was first {{introduced}} in the 1850s, with the earliest British patent for a metal <b>crinoline</b> (described as a 'skeleton petticoat of steel springs fastened to tape.') granted in July 1856. Alison Gernsheim suggests that the unidentified French inventor was probably R. C. Milliet of Besançon, as the July 1856 patent was filed by their British agent, C. Amet. Milliet had already patented a 'tournure de femme' in Paris on 24 April 1856 which was described as comprising 'elastic extensible circles joined together by vertical bands.' Following its introduction, the women's rights advocate Amelia Bloomer felt that her concerns about the hampering nature of multiple petticoats had been resolved, and dropped dress reform as an issue. Diana de Marly, in her biography of the couturier Charles Frederick Worth noted that by 1858 there existed steel factories catering solely to <b>crinoline</b> manufacturers, and shops that sold nothing else but crinolines. One {{of the most significant}} manufacturers of crinolines was that of Thomson & Co., founded by an American with branches across Europe and the United States. At the height of their success, up to four thousand crinolines were produced by Thomson's London factory in a day, whilst another plant in Saxony manufactured 9.5 million crinolines over a twelve-year period. In 1859 the New York factory, which employed about a thousand girls, used 300,000yards of steel wire every week to produce between three and four thousand crinolines per day, while the rival Douglas & Sherwood factory in Manhattan used a ton of steel each week in manufacturing hoop skirts.|$|E
5|$|The <b>crinoline</b> was {{perceived}} as a signifier of social identity, with a popular subject for cartoons being that of maids wearing crinolines like their mistresses, much to the higher-class ladies' disapproval. The questions of servants in <b>crinoline</b> and the related social concerns were raised by George Routledge in an etiquette manual published in 1875, where he criticised London housemaids for wearing hoops at work. As the girls knelt to scrub the doorsteps, Routledge described how their hoops rose to expose their lower bodies, inspiring street harassment from errand boys and other male passers-by. Routledge firmly opined that servants ought to save their fashionable garments for their leisure periods, and dress appropriately for their work. However, this was challenged by some servants who saw attempts to control their dress as equivalent to controlling their liberty, and refused to work for employers who tried to forbid crinolines.|$|E
5|$|The <b>crinoline</b> {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their {{accustomed}} shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage <b>crinoline</b> with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E

50|$|As skirts became fuller {{from the}} 1830s, women wore many {{petticoats}} {{to achieve a}} fashionable bell shape. By the 1850s, stiffened <b>crinolines</b> and later hoop skirts allowed ever wider skirts to be worn. The bustle, a frame or pad worn over the buttocks to enhance their shape, had been used off and on by women for two centuries, but reached the height of its popularity in the later 1880s, and went out of fashion for good in the 1890s.Women dressed in <b>crinolines</b> often wore drawers under them for modesty and warmth.|$|R
5|$|According to {{historian}} L. T. C. Rolt, {{the original}} installation was of machines for wire-braiding <b>crinoline</b> frames, and Charles simultaneously imported metal cutting machine tools to aid his friend Hiram Maxim who was developing a machine gun. This is a moot point: the Maxim gun was not developed {{for a further}} 20 years, and {{it is unlikely that}} Maxim was in England during the 1860s; however, the Gatling gun was patented in 1862. Rolt claimed that Charles Churchill & Co began trading in 1865 as importers of engineering tools and is thought to have imported the first examples of Morse tapered twist drills, self-centring drill chucks (manufactured by Cushman) and hand-held micrometers into the UK. According to Floud, he imported agricultural implements and other non-engineering items at this time. In its early years the company traded from 28 Wilson Street, Finsbury: sales catalogues were published certainly between 1876 and 1882 stating this address.|$|E
5|$|In some contexts, the {{traditional}} hooped <b>crinoline</b> {{may be seen}} as controversial, as in early 2015 when the University of Georgia reportedly requested hoop skirts not be worn to certain fraternity events due to their perceived association with Southern Belles and the slave-owning, upper socioeconomic classes of the American Deep South. The reason for the proposed ban was linked to the SAE racism incident earlier that year, with several articles noting it was a well-intentioned attempt to avoid the University of Georgia fraternities facing charges of racial insensitivity. It was noted that hoop skirts and crinolines had been worn by both black and white women of all classes and social standings during the historical period in question, and that despite popular associations, they were not exclusive to the image of the Southern Belle.|$|E
5|$|Despite some claims, {{such as that}} by the {{historian}} Max von Boehm, that the largest crinolines measured up to ten yards (30feet) around, the photohistorian Alison Gernsheim concluded that the maximum realistic circumference was in fact between five-and-a-half and six yards. Whilst a loosely gathered skirt draped over a large hoop would certainly require a higher yardage, Gernsheim noted that ten yard hems were highly improbable. Staged photographs showing women wearing exaggeratedly large crinolines were quite popular, such as a widely published sequence of five stereoscope views showing a woman dressing {{with the assistance of}} several maids who require long poles to lift her dress over her head and other ingenious means of navigating her enormous hoopskirt. Such photographs, which re-enacted contemporary caricatures rather than accurately reflecting reality, were aimed towards the voyeur's market. However, it was a fact that the size of the <b>crinoline</b> often caused difficulties in passing through doors, boarding carriages and generally moving about. By the late 1860s many crinolines were of a significantly reduced size, as noted by a Victoria and Albert Museum curator observing the sizes of cage crinolines in the Museum's collection.|$|E

25|$|At {{the height}} of his success, Worth {{reformed}} the highly popular trend, the <b>crinoline.</b> It had grown increasingly large in size, making it difficult for women to manage even the most basic activities, such as walking through doors, sitting, caring for their children, or holding hands. Worth wanted to design a more practical silhouette for women, so he made the <b>crinoline</b> more narrow and gravitated the largest part to the back, freeing up a woman’s front and sides. Worth’s new <b>crinoline</b> was a major success. Eventually, Worth abandoned the <b>crinoline</b> altogether, creating a straight gown shape without a defined waist that became known as the princess line.|$|E
50|$|The 1850s {{are well}} known for the <b>crinolines,</b> which reached {{greatest}} popularity around 1860. The <b>crinolines</b> were made of whalebone and were covered with layers of flounced petticoats. The dresses were made of several materials such as brocade, taffeta, silk and velvet. There was a difference between dresses {{for the day and}} dresses for the evening. Dark coloured fabrics were usually used for day dresses. In complete contrast to this, the evening dresses were usually white. Very fashionable were also flounced dresses with flower prints, stripes and bands. The sleeves were worn wider; they were no longer fitted to the wrist.|$|R

25|$|Nevertheless, in 1856, skirts {{expanded}} even further; {{creating a}} dome shape, {{due to the}} invention of the first artificial cage <b>crinoline.</b> The purpose of the <b>crinoline</b> was to create an artificial hourglass silhouette by accentuating the hips, and fashioning an illusion of a small waist; along with the corset. The cage <b>crinoline</b> was constructed by joining thin metal strips together to form a circular structure that could solely support the large width of the skirt. This was made possible by technology which allowed iron to be turned into steel, which could then be drawn into fine wires. Although often ridiculed by journalists and cartoonists of the time as the <b>crinoline</b> swelled in size, this innovation freed women from the heavy weight of petticoats and was a much more hygienic option.|$|E

25|$|By 1860's when Europe was {{all about}} made to fit {{tailoring}} <b>crinolines</b> were considered impractical.

In 1870s there was a invention of Ciurass Bodice that {{is a piece of}} armour that covers the torso and functions like a corset. Towards the end of Victorian reign dresses were flared naturally as <b>crinolines</b> were rejected by middle class women and designers such as Charles Fredrick Worth were also against it. All these inventions and changes in fashion led to women liberation as tailored looks improved posture and were more practical.|$|R
