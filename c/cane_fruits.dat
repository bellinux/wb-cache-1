5|$|Some rodent {{species are}} serious {{agricultural}} pests, eating {{large quantities of}} food stored by humans. For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia {{was estimated to be}} enough to feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide is caused by {{a relatively small number of}} species, chiefly rats and mice. In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, groundnuts, vegetables and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as rats and mice, species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus, Akodon, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Phyllotis, Sigmodon and Zygodontomys, damage many crops including sugar <b>cane,</b> <b>fruits,</b> vegetables, and tubers.|$|E
25|$|Although {{only about}} one-quarter of Taiwan's land area is {{suitable}} for farming, virtually all farmland is intensely cultivated, with some areas suitable for two and even three crops a year. However, increases in agricultural production have been much slower than industrial growth. Agricultural modernization has been inhibited by {{the small size of}} farms and the lack of investment in better facilities and training to develop more profitable businesses. Taiwan's agricultural population has steadily decreased from 1974 to 2002, prompting the Council of Agriculture to introduce modern farm management, provide technical training, and offer counseling for better production and distribution systems. Promotion of farm mechanization has helped to alleviate labor shortages while increasing productivity; both rice and sugar cane production are completely mechanized. Taiwan's main crops are rice, sugar <b>cane,</b> <b>fruits</b> (many of them tropical), and vegetables. Although self-sufficient in rice production, Taiwan imports large amounts of wheat, mostly from the United States. Meat production and consumption has risen sharply, reflecting a high standard of living. Taiwan has exported large amounts of frozen pork, although this was affected by an outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in 1997. Other agricultural exports include fish, aquaculture and sea products, canned and frozen vegetables, and grain products. Imports of agriculture products are expected to increase due to the WTO accession, which is opening previously protected agricultural markets.|$|E

[...] Many records mistakenly mention that it produces 43% of India's wheat, but that is actually its contribution to the national pool. It produces 17% of India's wheat, and 11% of India's rice (2013 data). The total area of Punjab is just 1.4% of total area of India, but it produces roughly 12% of the cereals produced in the country. The largest grown crop is wheat. Other important crops are rice, cotton, sugarcane, pearl millet, maize, barley and fruits.The principal crops of Punjab are barley, wheat, rice, maize and sugarcane. Among the fodder crops are bajra and jowar. In the category of fruits, it produces abundant stock of kinnow.The main sources of irrigation are canals and tube wells.The rabi or the spring harvest consists of wheat, gram, barley, potatoes and winter vegetables. The Kharif or the autumn harvest consists of rice, maize, sugarcane, cotton and pulses.Agriculture sector is the largest contributor to the gross state domestic product (GSDP) of Punjab.

The six most numerous were Apanteles aristoteliae Vier., Meteorus argyrotaenia Johan., Phytodietus vulgaris cress., Oncophanes americanus (Weed), Enytus eureka (Ash.), and Diadegma spp. The rate of parasitism averaged 20 % in two commercial fields which had large larval populations of A. citrana. Conversely, five fields with relatively low density A. citrana populations averaged 66 % apparent parasitism. This suggests that parasitoids may be important in maintaining orange tortrix populations at low levels. Three braconid Redacted for Privac...|$|E
