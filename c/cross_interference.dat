This drawback of the WVD is the motivation for introducing other TFDs such as Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (PWVD), SPWVD, Choi-Williams Distribution (CWD), and Cohen kernel distribution to define a kernel in ambiguity domain that can eliminate cross terms. These distributions belong to a general class called the Cohens class of bilinear TF representation [3]. These TFDs are not always positive. In order to produce meaningful features, the value of the TFD should be positive at each point; otherwise the extracted features may not be interpretable, for example, the WVD always results in positive instantaneous frequency, but it also gives that the expectation value of the square of the frequency, for a fixed time, can become negative which does not make any sense [8].

Unfortunately, corresponding improvements in memory design technology have not been realized, resulting in latencies of over 100 cycles between processors and main memory. This ever-increasing gap in speed has pushed the current memory-hierarchy approach to its limit. Traditional approaches to memory-hierarchy management have not yielded satisfactory results. Hardware solutions require more power and energy than desired and do not scale well. Compiler solutions tend to miss too many optimization opportunities because of limited compile-time knowledge of run-time behavior. This paper explores a different approach that combines both approaches by making use of the static knowledge obtained by the compiler in the dynamic decision making of the micro-architecture. We propose a memory-hierarchy design based on working sets that uses compiletime annotations regarding the working set of memory operations to guide cache placement decisions. Our experiments show that a working-set-based memory hierarchy can significantly reduce the miss rate for memory-intensive tiled kernels by limiting <b>cross</b> <b>interference.</b> The working-set-based memory hierarchy allows the compiler to tile many loops without concern for <b>cross</b> <b>interference</b> in the cache, making tile size choice easier.

This method can not only retain the deformable character between the root model and the part model according to the gradient information, but also can enhance the gradient information of each part according to the color information, maximizing the stability and accuracy of vehicle target detection in complex environments.|$|R

It is assumed that there exists an adversary which wants to eavesdrop on the information transmission from the base station (BS) to CUs. Since D 2 D communication shares the same spectrum with cellular network, <b>cross</b> <b>interference</b> must be considered. However, when secrecy capacity is considered, the interference caused by D 2 D communication can help to improve the secrecy communications by confusing the eavesdroppers. Since both systems share the same spectrum, <b>cross</b> <b>interference</b> must be considered. We formulate the proposed resource allocation into an optimization problem {{whose objective is to}} maximize the average transmission rate of D 2 D pair {{in the presence of the}} cellular communications under average transmission power constraint. For the cellular network, we require a minimum average achievable secrecy rate in the absence of D 2 D communication as well as a maximum secrecy outage probability in the presence of D 2 D communication which should be satisfied. Due to high complexity convex optimization methods, to solve the proposed optimization problem, we apply Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which is an evolutionary approach. Moreover, we model and study the error in the feedback channel and the imperfectness of channel distribution information (CDI) using parametric and nonparametric methods. Finally, the impact of different system parameters on the performance of the proposed scheme is investigated through simulations. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using numerical results for different scenarios. Comment: IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 201...|$|E
