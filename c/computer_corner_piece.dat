5000|$|The puzzle can {{be thought}} of as {{twisting}} around its <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> - each twist rotates one <b>corner</b> <b>piece</b> and permutates the three face centre pieces around it. An interesting feature is that the face centre pieces go [...] "underneath" [...] <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> during a twist.|$|R
50|$|The Pyraminx Duo is {{a puzzle}} {{in the shape}} of a tetrahedron, divided into 4 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> and 4 face centre <b>pieces.</b> Each <b>corner</b> <b>piece</b> has three colours, while the centre pieces each have a single colour. Each face of the puzzle {{contains}} one face centre <b>piece</b> and three <b>corner</b> <b>pieces.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Tuttminx has a {{total of}} 32 face centre pieces (12 {{pentagon}} and 20 hexagon), 60 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> and 90 edge pieces. The face centres each have a single colour, which identifies the colour of that face in the solved state. The edge pieces have two colours and the <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> have three colours. Each hexagonal face contains a centre <b>piece,</b> 6 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> and 6 edge pieces, while each pentagonal face contains a centre <b>piece,</b> 5 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> and 5 edge pieces.|$|R
5000|$|The {{positions}} {{of four of}} the smaller <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> depend on the {{positions of}} the other 4 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces,</b> and only even permutations of these positions are possible. Hence the number of arrangements of <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> is 4!/2. Each <b>corner</b> <b>piece</b> has 3 possible orientations, although the orientation of the last corner is determined by the orientations of the other corners, so the number of possible corner orientations is 37. However, the orientations of 4 of the corners plus the position of one of the other corners determines {{the positions of the}} remaining 3, so the total number of possible combinations of corners is only [...]|$|R
50|$|The puzzle {{consists}} of 4 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces,</b> 4 edge pieces and 1 centre <b>piece.</b> Each <b>corner</b> <b>piece</b> has four colours each, each edge piece has three colours each, while the centre piece has two colours (on the opposite faces). The puzzle {{can be thought}} of as twisting around its edge pieces - each twist causes one edge piece to rotate 180° in place, and the two adjacent <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> to swap positions (while also being rotated).|$|R
50|$|The Megaminx {{is made in}} {{the shape}} of a dodecahedron, and has 12 face center <b>pieces,</b> 20 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces,</b> and 30 edge pieces. The face centers each have a single color, which {{identifies}} the color of that face in the solved state. The edge pieces have two colors, and the <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> have three. Each face contains a center <b>piece,</b> 5 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> and 5 edge <b>pieces.</b> The <b>corner</b> and edge <b>pieces</b> are shared with adjacent faces. The face centers can only rotate in place, but the other pieces can be permuted by twisting the face layer around the face center.|$|R
50|$|Mathematically speaking, {{however, the}} Skewb Ultimate has {{exactly the same}} {{structure}} as the Skewb Diamond. The solution for the Skewb Diamond {{can be used to}} solve this puzzle, by identifying the Diamond's face pieces with the Ultimate's <b>corner</b> <b>pieces,</b> and the Diamond's <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> with the Ultimate's edge pieces. The only additional trick here is that the Ultimate's <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> (equivalent to the Diamond's face pieces) are sensitive to orientation, and so may require an additional algorithm for orienting them after being correctly placed.|$|R

50|$|The Helicopter Cube {{is made in}} {{the shape}} of a cube, cut into 8 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> and 24 face center <b>pieces.</b> Each <b>corner</b> <b>piece</b> has 3 colors, and each face center piece has only a single color. Unlike the Rubik's Cube, its faces do not rotate; rather, the pieces are {{scrambled}} by rotating around a cube edge.|$|R

50|$|Only even {{permutations}} of the <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> are possible, so {{the number}} of possible arrangements of <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> is 6!/2. Each corner has two possible orientations (it {{is not possible to}} change their orientation by 90° without disassembling the puzzle), but the orientation of the last corner is determined by the other 5. Hence, {{the number of}} possible corner orientations is 25.|$|R
5000|$|Despite its appearance, {{the puzzle}} {{is in fact}} {{equivalent}} to a shape modification of the original 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube. Its 4 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> on the <b>corners</b> and 4 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> on the face centers together are equivalent to the 8 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> of the Rubik's Cube, its 6 edge pieces are equivalent to the face centers of the Rubik's Cube, and its non-center face pieces are equivalent to the edge pieces of the Rubik's Cube. Thus, the same methods used to solve the Rubik's Cube {{may be used to}} solve the Master Pyramorphix, with a few minor differences: the center pieces are sensitive to orientation because they have two colors, unlike the usual coloring scheme used for the Rubik's Cube, and the face centers are not sensitive to orientation (however when in the [...] "wrong" [...] orientation parity errors may occur). In effect, it behaves as a Rubik's Cube with a non-standard coloring scheme where center piece orientation matters, and the orientation of 4 of the 8 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> do not, technically, matter.|$|R
5000|$|There are 24 edge pieces {{which show}} two {{coloured}} sides each, and eight <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> which show three colours. Each <b>corner</b> <b>piece</b> or pair of edge pieces shows a unique colour combination, {{but not all}} combinations are present (for example, there is no piece with both red and orange sides, if red and orange are {{on opposite sides of}} the solved Cube). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting the layers of the cube, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares and the distribution of colour combinations on edge and <b>corner</b> <b>pieces.</b>|$|R

The roof slab is entirely missing, as {{are most of}} one side and one end panel and a <b>corner</b> <b>piece</b> so that the extant sarcophagus is essentially L-shaped. The external dimensions of the sarcophagus are 177 cm by 90 cm and a height of 70 cm. The stone used is a local sandstone.|$|R
5000|$|In Rin-chen Lha-mo's work We Tibetans (1926), {{she states}} that [...] "The longer the {{sequence}} you can capture [...] [...] [...] the better and the sequence is not broken by going around a corner, thus:". [...] This {{has been interpreted}} to mean {{that it may be}} possible to capture a <b>corner</b> <b>piece,</b> or a line(s) of pieces that occupy a portion of two adjacent sides of the board (hence at most one <b>corner</b> <b>piece)</b> by flanking them on two opposite ends provided there is no vacant space between any of the pieces, and Rin-cen Lha-mo actually provides an illustration showing just that. This rule is useful because it's generally difficult to perform these types of captures using the regular custodian method. However, some critics have debated whether this rule can be applied to any position on the board, or just with <b>corner</b> <b>pieces.</b> Rin-chen Lha-mo does however specifically state [...] "...going around a corner...", and provides an illustrative example of pieces strictly going around a corner of the board. Lastly, Rin-chen Lha-mo does not specify whether or not the two pieces used to flank the captured pieces must occupy the same two adjacent sides that the captured pieces are occupying, although based upon the illustrative example she gave, she may have been attempting to suggest that. For example, in the beginning of the game, can one player attempt to capture the other player's 14 pieces as it is initially laid out using this modified custodian method? She also does not specify if (any of) the two <b>pieces</b> can be <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> (but opposite one another on the board if both are <b>corner</b> <b>pieces)</b> since these two <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> would not only occupy the same adjacent sides of the captured pieces, but also the remaining two other sides.|$|R

50|$|The puzzle has 150 movable pieces: 60 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces,</b> 60 edge {{pieces that}} are {{adjacent}} to a pentagonal face (so-called pentagonal edges) and 30 edge pieces that are not (non-pentagonal edges). Only even permutations of all three types of pieces are possible (i.e. {{it is impossible to}} have only one pair of identical pieces swapped). Thus, there are 60!/2 possible ways to arrange the <b>corner</b> <b>pieces,</b> 60!/2 ways to arrange the pentagonal edges and 30!/2 ways to arrange the non-pentagonal edges.|$|R

30|$|There {{are many}} kinds of Rubik’s Cube solutions. The “layer first law” was {{proposed}} by David Singmaster and {{is used by the}} most people. First, restore the top layer, and then restore the middle layer, and finally restore the bottom layer as well. Mathematician Conway [31] at Cambridge University proposed a six-stage reduction method {{from the bottom of the}} cube to the middle and then to the top, and from the edge <b>pieces</b> to the <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> gradually. Patrick [32] proposed a six-sided reduction method: first, restore the <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> and edge pieces of the top layer, then restore the bottom <b>corner</b> <b>pieces,</b> and finally the edge pieces of the middle and bottom are restored. Jessica invented the “Fridrich Method” which is used by most of the racing players to quickly restore the Rubik’s Cube. This method is used widely, inspires and influences cube researchers, and has played a critical role in the development of Rubik’s Cube [33].|$|R

50|$|The Skewb Diamond has 6 {{octahedral}} <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> and 8 triangular face centers. All pieces {{can move}} relative to each other. It is a deep-cut puzzle; its planes of rotation bisect it.|$|R

50|$|ELL : Edges of the Last Layer. The {{second of}} two steps {{of one of the}} methods of solving the last layer of the cube, solving the edge pieces without {{disturbing}} the <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> (see CLL).|$|R
5000|$|The puzzle {{consists}} of 4 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces,</b> 4 face centers, 6 edge pieces, and 12 non-center face pieces. Being an edge-turning puzzle, the edge pieces only rotate in place, {{while the rest}} of the pieces can be permuted. The face centers and <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> are interchangeable because they are both corners although they are shaped differently, and the non-center face pieces may be flipped, leading to a wide variety of exotic shapes as the puzzle is twisted. If only 180° turns are made, it is possible to scramble only the colors while retaining the puzzle's tetrahedral shape. When 90° and 180° turns are made this puzzle can [...] "shape shift″.|$|R
50|$|The puzzle {{consists}} of a dodecahedron sliced {{in such a way}} that the slices meet at the center of each pentagonal face. This cuts the puzzle into 20 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> and 30 edge pieces, with 50 pieces in total.|$|R
50|$|The puzzle twists {{around the}} faces: each twist rotates one face centre piece and moves all edge and <b>corner</b> <b>pieces</b> {{surrounding}} it. The pentagonal faces can be twisted 72° in either direction, while the hexagonal faces can be rotated 120°.|$|R
50|$|There are 4 <b>corner</b> <b>pieces.</b> Each <b>corner</b> can be {{twisted in}} 3 {{different}} orientations, {{independently of the}} other corners.
