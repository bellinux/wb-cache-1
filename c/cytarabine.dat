25|$|Flucytosine may {{increase}} the toxicity of amphotericin B and vice versa, although the combination may be life-saving and should be used whenever indicated (e.g., cryptococcal meningitis). The cytostatic <b>cytarabine</b> inhibits the antimycotic activity of flucytosine.|$|E
25|$|In the past, antimetabolites (e.g., <b>cytarabine,</b> hydroxyurea), alkylating agents, {{interferon}} alfa 2b, and steroids {{were used as}} treatments of CML in the chronic phase, but since the 2000s {{have been replaced by}} Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitors drugs that specifically target BCR-ABL, the constitutively activated tyrosine kinase fusion protein caused by the Philadelphia chromosome translocation. Despite the move to replacing cytotoxic antineoplastics (standard anticancer drugs) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors sometimes hydroxyurea is still used to counteract the high leukocyte counts encountered during treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib; in these situations it may be the preferred myelosuppressive agent due to its relative lack of leukemogenic effects and hence the relative lack of potential for secondary hematologic malignancies to result from treatment. IRIS, an international study that compared interferon/cytarabine combination and the first of these new drugs imatinib, with long-term follow up, demonstrated the clear superiority of tyrosine-kinase-targeted inhibition over existing treatments.|$|E
25|$|The anti-folates include {{methotrexate}} and pemetrexed. Methotrexate inhibits {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The deoxynucleoside analogues include <b>cytarabine,</b> gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.|$|E
500|$|All FAB subtypes except M3 {{are usually}} given {{induction}} chemotherapy with <b>cytarabine</b> (ara-C) and an anthracycline (most often daunorubicin). This induction chemotherapy regimen {{is known as}} [...] "7+3" [...] (or [...] "3+7"), because the <b>cytarabine</b> is given as a continuous IV infusion for seven consecutive days while the anthracycline is given for three consecutive days as an IV push. Up to 70% of people with AML will achieve a remission with this protocol. Other alternative induction regimens, including high-dose <b>cytarabine</b> alone, FLAG-like regimens or investigational agents, may also be used. Because of the toxic effects of therapy, including myelosuppression and {{an increased risk of}} infection, induction chemotherapy may not be offered to the very elderly, and the options may include less intense chemotherapy or palliative care.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fractional}} {{killing of}} tumors {{in response to}} treatment {{is assumed to be}} due to the cell cycle specificity of chemotherapy drugs. [...] <b>Cytarabine,</b> a DNA-synthesis inhibitor also known as ara-C, is cited as the classic cell cycle phase-specific agent.

[...] Consistent with this, leukemia patients respond better to <b>cytarabine</b> treatments given every 12 hours rather than every 24 hours.
