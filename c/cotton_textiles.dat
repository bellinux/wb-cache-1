5|$|Bengal was an {{affluent}} region with a Bengali Muslim majority and Bengali Hindu minority, and was globally dominant in {{industries such as}} textile manufacturing and shipbuilding. The capital Dhaka had an estimated 80,000 skilled textile weavers. It was an exporter of silk and <b>cotton</b> <b>textiles,</b> steel, saltpeter, and agricultural and industrial produce.|$|E
5|$|Occupations in Tirunelveli include service-sector {{activities}} such as administration, agricultural trading, tourism, banking, agro-machinery, information technology and educational services. In 1991, the Tirunelveli region ranked second {{in the number of}} women workers. Service sectors such as tourism have developed, due to a growth in religious tourism. Tirunelveli has beedi and cement factories, tobacco companies, workshops for steel-based products and mills for <b>cotton</b> <b>textiles,</b> spinning and weaving; there are also small-scale industries, such as tanneries and brick kilns. The agricultural areas, hand-woven clothes and household industries contribute to the economic growth of the city. Food-processing industries have developed since the late 1990s; at the district level, it is the foremost industrial segment. Industries involving rice-making, blue-jelly metal manufacturing and jem power generating are located {{on the outskirts of the}} city. The major agricultural produce in the region is paddy and cotton. Beedi production during the 1990s earned an annual revenue of 190billion and a foreign exchange of 8billion across the three districts of Tirunelveli, Tiruchirapalli and Vellore.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish conquest {{stripped}} away {{most of the}} defining features of Maya civilization. However, many Maya villages remained remote from Spanish colonial authority, {{and for the most}} part continued to manage their own affairs. Maya communities and the nuclear family maintained their traditional day-to-day life. The basic Mesoamerican diet of maize and beans continued, although agricultural output was improved by the introduction of steel tools. Traditional crafts such as weaving, ceramics, and basketry continued to be practised. Community markets and trade in local products continued long after the conquest. At times, the colonial administration encouraged the traditional economy in order to extract tribute in the form of ceramics or <b>cotton</b> <b>textiles,</b> although these were usually made to European specifications. Maya beliefs and language proved resistant to change, despite vigorous efforts by Catholic missionaries. The 260-day tzolk'in ritual calendar continues in use in modern Maya communities in the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas, and millions of Mayan-language speakers inhabit the territory in which their ancestors developed their civilization.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates the {{influence}} of low-pressure air plasma before vacuum evaporation process on the <b>cotton</b> <b>textile</b> surface morphology, as well as evaporated copper coating adhesion. During the experiment, commercial <b>cotton</b> <b>textile</b> was functionalized with vacuum evaporation technique with or without low– pressure air plasma pre-treatment. Surface analysis of the <b>cotton</b> <b>textile</b> treated with low-pressure air plasma and evaporated copper was carried out using Scanning electron microscope. As shown in the experimental results, modification of <b>cotton</b> <b>textile</b> surface by applying low-pressure air plasma noticeably deteriorates adhesion of the evaporated copper coating to the <b>cotton</b> <b>textile</b> substrate. These can be explained as morphological changes of the <b>cotton</b> <b>textile</b> surface resulting from its modification with low-pressure air plasma.

5|$|The fort is {{the second}} largest Danish fort after Kronborg, the {{inspiration}} for Shakespeare's Hamlet. It was built by Ove Gjedde {{with the help of}} local laborers in Danish style. The lower compartment in the basement adjoining the fort was used as a store room, prison and a rest room for the soldiers, while the governor and priests resided in the second level. Fort Dansborg was the base for Danish settlement in the region during the early 17th century. Originally a fishing village, Tharangambadi (referred as Tranquebar) was fortified by the Danish, who used the port as the main trading post for the colony, with the major export of the colony being <b>cotton</b> <b>textiles.</b> During the middle of the 18th century, the commercial importance of the town declined and the centre of textile production moved to Serampore in the state of Bengal. But Tranquebar still remained the headquarters of the Colony. The fort and the town was sold to the British in 1845 and, along with Tharangambadi, the fort lost its significance as the town was not a trading post anymore.|$|E
5|$|On 30 July 1502, {{during his}} fourth voyage, Christopher Columbus arrived at Guanaja, {{one of the}} Bay Islands {{off the coast of}} Honduras. He sent his brother Bartholomew to scout the island. As Bartholomew {{explored}} the island with two boats, a large canoe approached from the west, apparently en route to the island. The canoe was carved from one large tree trunk and was powered by twenty-five naked rowers. Curious as to the visitors, Bartholomew Columbus seized and boarded it. He found it was a Maya trading canoe from Yucatán, carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo that included ceramics, <b>cotton</b> <b>textiles,</b> yellow stone axes, flint-studded war clubs, copper axes and bells, and cacao. Also among the cargo were a small number of women and children, probably destined to be sold as slaves, as were a number of the rowers. The Europeans looted whatever took their interest from amongst the cargo and seized the elderly Maya captain to serve as an interpreter; the canoe was then allowed to continue on its way. It is likely that news of the piratical strangers in the Caribbean passed along the Maya trade routes.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} main trade routes {{used by the}} Manche Ch'ol; the first went north along the Mopan River to Chacchilan, then {{overland}} to Nojpetén. The second followed the Cancuén River to Yol, and there joined the Pasión River northwards, leaving the river when it turned west and continuing overland to Nojpetén. Xocmo, on the Sacapulas River, was a trading port where the Manche and Lakandon Ch'ols met to trade cacao and annatto. Xocmo had a major fair, still taking place as late as 1676, where traders arrived from various colonial and independent settlements; these included Nojpetén and the towns of Cobán, San Agustín Lanquín and Sacapulas in colonial Verapaz. The Chols traded cacao and annatto into the encomienda towns of Verapaz in exchange for metal tools (particularly axes and machetes) and salt. Other products traded to the Manche by the Q'eqchi' of colonial Verapaz included <b>cotton</b> <b>textiles</b> and quetzal feathers. The Q'eqchi' used this trade to supply products demanded by their Spanish overlords under the repartimiento system. The Manche produced a number of products for trade, manufactured from resources in the southern Maya Mountains of Belize; these included blowguns, bows and arrows, finely sculpted greenstone axes, hammocks, manos and metates, pottery, and cane, {{all of which were}} traded across the southern Maya region.|$|E

40|$|Cotton fibre {{is mainly}} {{composed}} of cellulose, although non-cellulosic polysaccharides play key roles during fibre development {{and are still}} present in the harvested fibre. This study aimed at determining the fate of non-cellulosic polysaccharides during <b>cotton</b> <b>textile</b> processing. We analyzed non-cellulosic cotton fibre polysaccharides during different steps of <b>cotton</b> <b>textile</b> processing using GC-MS, HPLC and comprehensive microarray polymer profiling to obtain monosaccharide and polysaccharide amounts and linkage compositions. Additionally, in situ detection was used to obtain information on polysaccharide localization and accessibility. We show that pectic and hemicellulosic polysaccharide levels decrease during <b>cotton</b> <b>textile</b> processing and that some processing steps have more impact than others. Pectins and arabinose-containing polysaccharides are strongly impacted by the chemical treatments, with most being removed during bleaching and scouring. However, some forms of pectin are more resistant than others. Xylan and xyloglucan are affected in later processing steps {{and to a lesser}} extent, whereas callose showed a strong resistance to the chemical processing steps. This study shows that non-cellulosic polysaccharides are differently impacted by the treatments used in <b>cotton</b> <b>textile</b> processing with some hemicelluloses and callose being resistant to these harsh treatments...|$|R
