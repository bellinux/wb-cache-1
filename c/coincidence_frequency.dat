Piezoelectric patches are periodically bonded on the surfaces of the plate in a collocated fashion, and are interconnected via an inductive circuit network. This piezoelectric system is termed as piezo-electromechanical (PEM) plate in the paper. Homogenization methods are involved under a sub-wavelength assumption to analytically develop the dynamical equations for the PEM plate. The dispersion relationships and energy densities of the wave modes propagating in the PEM plate are studied; the sub-wavelength assumption is verified for the simulations in this paper. The <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequency</b> of the PEM plate is researched, and {{results show that the}} <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequency</b> of the PEM plate will disappear at certain circumstances; mathematical and physical explanations are made for this phenomenon.

40|$|The {{intensive}} use of light plate-like structures in aircraft industry and transport industry {{result in more}} serious vibration and noise issues for their higher dynamical sensitivities. To deal with these problems, techniques based on piezoelectric materials have been proposed and numerous papers have contributed to their development and application[1 - 7]. In these applications, periodically distributed piezoelectric control strategies[4 - 7] attracted many researchers for their abilities to modify the equivalent dynamical parameters of the piezo-mechanical system to obtain new desired vibro-acoustic functionalities, i. e., materializing ?integrated smart structure? or ?metacomposite?[8]. However, previous works who used the periodically distributed piezoelectric techniques mainly focused on controlling vibration, associated sound radiation[9] or wave propagation on the structures, few of research concerns control sound transmission. In our work, wave propagation properties and sound insulation performance of a thin plate with interconnected distributed piezoelectric patches via an inductive circuit network were studied. Firstly, analytical dynamical equations for this piezo-electromechanical plate (PEM plate for short) were established by using homogenization method under sub-wavelength assumption. Then, dispersion relationships and energy density of the wave modes propagating in PEM plate were analyzed. At last, the <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequency</b> {{as well as the}} sound transmission loss (STL) were studied. The results obtained lead to the following conclusions: (1) Two free bending waves exist in PEM plate with different wave speeds and translate energy both in mechanical field and in electric field. (2) There exists a region for the incident angle of sound wave of PEM plate, if the incident angle of sound wave lies in the region then there is not the <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequency</b> around where the insulation effect is worst. (3) The disappearance of <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequency</b> can be used to optimize the value of inductance to considerably improve the sound insulation performance of PEM plate in coincidence region...|$|E

40|$|Suhr, JonghwanSandwich {{structures}} are utilized in many applications for their superior mechanical performance including strength and stiffness-to-weight ratios compared to metallic structures. Unfortunately {{as a result}} of these mechanical properties, sandwich composites are also excellent radiators of noise beginning at low vibrational frequencies. However, in applications which require the materials with the highest mechanical performance at a low-weight, such as aircraft, rotorcraft, wind turbine blades, or automobiles, acoustic performance remains a secondary design requirement. Current state-of-art methods involve additional vibration and sound absorbing layers, which are costly and increase manufacturing time. Therefore, solutions are sought to achieve improved acoustic and vibrational performance without the sacrifice of mechanical performance or weight. This study employs a wave number approach to characterize the acoustic performance from the vibrational response of sandwich composite beams, along with their structural loss factor (??). It was first determined that the effect of changing the beam???s core thickness on the acoustic performance is non-linear, having a hyperbolic profile. Secondly, the core material???s specific shear modulus is inversely proportional to acoustic performance. Moreover, outstanding damping properties can help mitigate noise radiation over a broad range of frequency ranges, especially for frequencies under 1000 Hz. With such a characterization, the wave number and damping properties of natural material based sandwich structures was explored. The purpose of investigating such materials is that they provide environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional, synthetic sandwich composite structures. Utilizing a cotton or bamboo fiber face sheet with a Rohacell foam core achieved 100 % improvement in <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequency,</b> while using the same face sheets coupled with a balsa-wood core showed a 233 % improvement in <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequency.</b> All beams showed substantial reductions in wave number amplitudes, which correlate to the level of noise radiation. Finally, the use of a natural cork agglomerate as a core material showed unprecedented improvements in coincidence frequency; the <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequency</b> was not observed for vibrational frequencies up to 10 kHz. Along with such improvements, reductions in wave number amplitudes and increases in damping values were observed over all frequency ranges. Thus, it is concluded that a cork-agglomerate core sandwich composite could be a ???noise free??? sandwich structure with almost no compromise in flexural bending stiffness. Moreover, cork is another natural material which is not only a renewable resource, but only requires minimal carbon emissions during its fabrication and processing into an agglomerate.

40|$|Corrugated {{panels are}} often used in the {{construction}} of industrial buildings as they have a high strength to weight ratio. However, the Sound Transmission Loss (TL) of a corrugated panel tends to be poorer and more difficult to understand than that of a comparable flat panel. In the present paper this issue is studied both experimentally and theoretically. The TL of three sinusoidal and three trapezoidal panels with different corrugation periods and heights was measured in the laboratory. In addition, calculated values were obtained by various methods, by an analytical approximation which consider the corrugated panel as a thin orthotropic flat plate of infinite extent with appropriate mass per area and "equivalent" bending stiffnesses and by a combination of Finite Elements for the panels and Boundary Elements for the sending and receiving rooms of the testing facility. Meaningful comparison between measured and calculated results faces several difficulties, in particular the uncertainty in the boundary conditions originating from the mounting of the panels in the test opening and the limitation of the calculations for finite panels to frequencies considerably lower than the highest measured (5 kHz or 8 kHz). Consequently, the theoretical modeling of the measured TL is still incomplete or unsatisfactory.

In CAG none of the patients showed angiographic signs of CA stenosis, but changes of various degrees were detected by IVUS.

The roof section, framed by a grid of ribs, was originally constructed of a single honeycomb core/composite face sheet panel. The original panel has <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequencies</b> near 700 Hz, leading to poor TL across the frequency range of 1 to 4 kHz. To quiet the panel, the cross section was split into two thinner sandwich subpanels separated by an air gap. The air gap was sized to target the fundamental mass-spring-mass resonance of the double panel system to less than 500 Hz. The panels were designed to withstand structural loading from normal rotorcraft operation, as well as 'man-on-the-roof' static loads experienced during maintenance operations. Thin layers of VHB 9469 viscoelastomer from 3 M were also included in the face sheet ply layups, increasing panel damping loss factors from about 0. 01 to 0. 05. Measurements in the NASA SALT facility show the optimized panel provides 6 - 11 dB of acoustic transmission loss improvement, and 6 - 15 dB of structure-borne sound reduction at critical rotorcraft transmission tonal frequencies.

40|$|For ecologic {{sustainability}} {{and decreasing}} reserves of fossile energy sources, fuel efficiency {{is a major}} concern especially for passenger aircraft. Therefore, lightweight structures made from carbon fiber plastics offer great potential. But when used for panel-like structures, they have the disadvantage of lower damping and <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequencies</b> compared to conventional differential metal constructions. Both aspects lead to an increased vibration level and by this a higher noise radiation. Because of this, special noise and vibration treatment is needed to ensure passenger cabin comfort. Besides passive damping and active structural acoustic control (ASAC), piezoelectric shunt damping is investigated. Due to its broadband performance, the negative capacitance shunt can be used for multimode systems with varying eigenfrequencies. These shunts are usually built with operational amplifiers and passive components as resistors and capacitors. This setup is sufficient for laboratory tests at low excitation levels. In fact, it is not capable of accessing the full voltage amplitude of common piezoelectric transducers, because most operational amplifiers only deliver ± 15 V maximum output voltage. Therefore an improved setup is presented in this paper, which addresses the specific voltage requirements of a common piezoelectric transducer to achieve best performance. It comprises a tailored power source and an appropriate concept for the negative capacitance shunt hardware. This new hardware only uses standard operational amplifiers together with a high voltage power amplifier to cover the whole operating range of a piezoelectric transducer.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{need for}} lightweight structures in modern aerospace transport due to lower fuel consumption and increased transport capacity reveals an acoustic challenge. Because {{of the high}} stiffness and low mass the <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequencies</b> of lightweight structures are low compared to classical aluminum structures. That {{is the reason for}} a weak transmission loss of lightweight structures made of glass or carbon fiber reinforced plastics. Therefore, passive solutions are widely investigated to increase the transmission loss of lightweight helicopter trim panels. For example, in the European GARTEUR AG 20 "Cabin internal noise: simulation and experimental methods for new solutions for internal noise reduction", two helicopter trim panels are studied which are structurally optimized for an increased TL. In this paper the applicability of a semi-active shunt damping system to this structurally optimized helicopter trim panel is investigated experimentally. Prior to this, the semi-active shunt damping performance is studied on a classical steel plate and afterwards the damped helicopter trim panel is investigated in a transmission loss facility. Two experiments are conducted. First of all, the trim panel is excited with a point force and the surface vibrations are measured with a laser scanning vibrometer. In the second test the trim panel is excited with a diffuse sound field. It can be seen that the negative capacitance shunt is less effective on a higher damped structure. Global vibration reductions of only 3 - 4 are achieved during the shaker test. Concerning the transmission loss, the results are comparable to the vibration reduction.

40|$|Designing a {{fuselage}} involves many considerations such as {{strength and}} stability, fatigue, damage tolerance, fire and lightning resistance, thermal and acoustic insulation, production, inspection, maintenance and repair. In {{the background of}} the application of composite sandwich structures on the aircraft fuselage, the focus of the thesis is to investigate the vibration and acoustic behaviours of sandwich structures. As a preliminary design of aircraft fuselages, a sizing work of sandwich cylinders was conducted with respect to the strength and stability. FE models for the buckling prediction of the sandwich cylinder were validated with the analytical expressions. Under a typical flight loading, the sizing results of a sandwich cylinder and a laminated cylinder were compared and {{it was found that the}} mechanical efficiency of the sandwich cylinder is comparable to that of the traditional stiffened cylinder. Subjected to the diffuse acoustic field, the sound transmission loss (TL) of composite sandwich cylinders was investigated using an analytical method and the Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) method at 100 - 16000 Hz. The SEA method showed a good agreement with the analytical method. The parameters, including the fibre orientation, facing materials, cylinder geometry, core thickness, sandwich layup and core shear stiffness, were studied for their influences on the TL of cylindrical structures. A uniform laminated, a stiffened and a sandwich cylinder with the equivalent mass were compared for the sound insulation performance. The laminated cylinder had the largest TL below the <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequency</b> and the sandwich cylinder had the largest TL above the <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequency.</b> The structural velocities and noise reductions of laminated and sandwich cylinders were experimentally tested at 1 - 4000 Hz under a point acoustic excitation, and a mechanical excitation respectively. The wave propagation in the sandwich structure was compared with that in the laminated structure, as an explanation of the noise reduction difference of the two structures. As the <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequency</b> plays an important role on the sound transmission, influence parameters of the <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequency</b> of sandwich structures were also studied. To investigate the vibro-acoustic performance of sandwich structures under different kinds of external excitations, the FEM/BEM numerical method was used to analyze the noise reduction of sandwich cylinders at low frequencies. Under a force excitation, some parameters including the core shear stiffness, sandwich layup, core thickness and facing orientation were studied for their influences on the sound transmission. Results showed that there exist optimal values for these parameters to achieve the best sound insulation performance. Therefore, an efficient optimization technique using the acoustic transfer vector (ATV) and the genetic algorithm (GA) was applied to optimize a typical sandwich cylinder for the best noise insulation. In addition, taking a fuselage section as an example, a multi-objective optimization (weight & noise insulation) was conducted considering the mechanical constraints under flight load cases. The noise control treatment such as the addition of absorption layers is one of the common methods for the noise control of the transport vehicles. Thus the sound transmission of sandwich panels with open-cell foam was studied. The transfer matrix method (TMM) was used for the TL prediction of sandwich panels with porous foams. This method was validated by experimental results. A sensitivity study of the flow resistivity, tortuosity and porosity on the TL of sandwich panels was conducted. Then four kinds of absorption materials were studied for their influences on the TL of sandwich cylinders. Finally the TLs of a stiffened cylinder and a sandwich cylinder were compared in case of addition of absorption layers. As the damping plays an important role on the vibro-acoustic behaviors of sandwich structures, the damping properties of composite sandwich structures were studied using the modal strain energy (MSE) method and experimental measurements. The hysteresis method and the half power method were used for the damping measurement. Compared to the facing, the cores usually have much higher damping and they make the main contribution on the sandwich damping. Therefore the material damping properties of two kinds of foams (PMI & PVC) were measured at low frequencies using the hysteresis method. The measured results have been validated by numerical models. The damping of the PVC foam were also measured using the half power method and results showed a good agreement with those measured using the hysteresis method. For the damping prediction of sandwich structures, the MSE method was verified by the measurements using the half-power method. Finally, the effects of the core thickness and core properties on the damping of sandwich structures were studied. Composite design and productionAerospace Engineerin...|$|E

An existing panel, a Nomex honeycomb sandwich panel, was studied in detail. For the purpose of understanding the typical behavior of sandwich panels, a composite structure comprising two aluminum sheets with a relatively soft, poro-elastic foam core was also constructed and studied. The cores of both panels were modeled using an anisotropic (transversely isotropic) poro-elastic material theory. ^ Several estimation methods were used to obtain the material properties of the honeycomb core and the skin plates {{to be used in}} the numerical calculations. Appropriate values selected from among the estimates were used in the STL and free wave propagation models. The prediction model was then verified in two ways: first, the calculated wave speeds and STL of a single poro-elastic layer were numerically verified by comparison with the predictions of a previously developed isotropic model. Secondly, to physically validate the transversely isotropic model, the measured STL and the phase speeds of the sandwich panels were compared with their predicted values. ^ To analyze the actual treatment of a fuselage structure, multi-layered configurations, including a honeycomb panel and several layers such as air gaps, acoustic blankets and membrane partitions, were formulated. Then, to find the optimal solution for improving the sound barrier performance of an actual fuselage system, air layer depth and glass fiber lining effects were investigated by using these multi-layer models. ^ By using the free wave propagation model, the first anti-symmetric and symmetric modes of the sandwich panels were characterized to allow the identification of the <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the sandwich panel. The behavior of the STL could then be clearly explained by comparison with the free wave propagation solutions.

With water loading, the wave speed decreases, the amount of decrease increasing to approximately 14 percent below the inair value just below the critical frequency. At the critical frequency, the wave speed appears to jump to values nearly equal to the unloaded values. Radiation patterns were obtained and when edge effects are eliminated, are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions for an infinite fluid-loaded plate. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|This paper studies {{analytically}} {{the effects}} of an external mean flow and an internal gap mean flow on sound transmission through a double-wall cylindrical shell lined with poroelastic materials. The shell motions are described by Love’s theory, and the poroelastic lining is modeled as an equivalent fluid by considering only the energetically most dominant wave based on Biot’s theory. The transfer matrix method is employed to solve the system by applying appropriate boundary conditions. The random incidence transmission loss of the double-wall cylindrical shell in a diffuse sound field is calculated numerically in a wide frequency range. The numerical {{results suggest that the}} external flow and the gap flow have similar effects of improving considerably the sound insulation performance of such a double-wall sandwich shell below the <b>coincidence</b> <b>frequency.</b> In the presence of the external mean flow, increasing the gap flow Mach number enhances the transmission loss only when it becomes greater than the external flow Mach number. The internal gap flow has great potential for active/passive noise control and hence this gap flow effect needs further research...|$|E
40|$|We {{have given}} {{results of a}} search for short pulses of {{gravitational}} radiation carried out with two gravitational radiation detectors operating in <b>coincidence</b> over a <b>frequency</b> range from 650 to 1, 450 Hz. Detectors of that type may also be used within this frequency region to set upper limits to fluxes of gravitational radiation of either continuous or incoherent waveform. The latter may include pulses which occur at a high rate but {{are too small to}} be detected individually. We describe here a preliminary experiment designed to search for any such signals in a general way...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{observed}} repeatedly in the post-earthquake investigations that buildings having frequency similar to soil frequency (coming from H/V for example) exhibit significantly greater damage due to the double resonator concept (Caracas 1967, Mexico 1985, L'Aquila 2009). However this observation is generally not taken directly into account neither in present-day seismic regulations (small scale), nor in large-scale seismic risk analysis. We considered a theoretical analysis to study the effect of <b>frequency</b> <b>coincidence</b> between soil and building. As a first step, 887 natural soil profiles with linear behavior are associated {{to a set of}} single degree of freedom elastoplastic oscillators. The results obtained are used to quantify the damage increment related to the soil-building <b>frequency</b> <b>coincidence</b> and depending on different parameters such as the loading level characterized by the peak ground acceleration (PGA), the soil profile (impedance contrast, soil frequency) and the building (ductility, fundamental frequency). This statistical work is based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach that does not require any prior knowledge, confirming that the main parameter controlling the damage increase is the ratio structure frequency to soil frequency (fstruct/fsoil), with a synaptic weight exceeding 58 % (when PGA represents 27. 05 %, the impedance contrast 10. 44 % and ductility 4. 24 %). The leading parameter, i. e. the fstruct/fsoil ratio, controls also the damage increment when considering various ductility classes with a synaptic weight percentage of 45 %; the parameter that follows is the PGA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The burst {{search in}} LIGO {{relies on the}} {{coincident}} detection of transient signals in multiple interferometers. As only minimal assumptions are made about the event waveform or duration, the analysis pipeline requires loose <b>coincidence</b> in time, <b>frequency</b> and amplitude. Confidence in the resulting events and their waveform consistency is established through a time-domain coherent analysis: the r-statistic test. This paper presents a performance study of the r-statistic test for triple coincidence events in the second LIGO Science Run (S 2), with emphasis {{on its ability to}} suppress the background false rate and its efficiency at detecting simulated bursts of different waveforms close to the S 2 sensitivity curve...|$|R
