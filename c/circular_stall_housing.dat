40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} profitability of milk production over several years in a herd of about 100 cows, taking into account changes in the housig system from the tethering to free stall in the “Przyszłość” Farming Cooperative. The study considered costs and income obtained from milk production and assessed profitability of this direction of agricultural activity. The profit being an equivalent of net income was adopted as the final financial result. Among milk productivity indexes the following were calculated: cost of direct production of 1 l milk, total production cost of 1 l milk, profit generated by 1 l milk, profit per 1 cow and per 1 milking cow, the ratio of sale price to production cost of 1 l milk and production profitability index. The above mentioned parameters of milk production efficiency were calculated for the analysed years and for the period of tethering and free <b>stall</b> <b>housing.</b> Level of profitability of milk production in the “Przyszłość” Farming Cooperative was varied, which was conditioned by decreasing production costs and the price of its sales each year. The most advantageous values of milk production profitability index were recorded in 2001 and 2005. With free <b>stall</b> <b>housing</b> system of cows milk production increased increasing the cost of its production at the same time. The main factors causing a reduction of milk production profitability in the free stall system in comparison to the tethering system were connected with significantly higher expenditure on fodder (mainly ready-purchased). The transition from the tethering management system to the free stall system resulted in relatively high values of milk production efficiency indexes at simultaneous reduction of labour consumption and considerable improvement of animal welfare...|$|R
40|$|Lameness in {{dairy cows}} {{continues}} to be a major problem for the industry world-wide. Prevalence appears higher in free <b>stall</b> <b>housed</b> dairy herds than in tie stall herds in Wisconsin, and is especially a problem in free stall herds using mat or mattress stall surfaces compared to those herds using sand. This article describes some of the behavioral differences which contribute to this difference. In particular, lame cows housed in mattress free stall barns appear to spend longer standing in the stall, compared to lame cows in sand stalls. This time spent standing appears to reflect a difficulty in performing the process of lying down and standing up. Future stall design recommendations must be based on providing a stall in which lame cows can maintain normal daily activity patterns...|$|R

50|$|The core of {{the farm}} {{property}} was purchased by Henry Duncan in 1904, with a potato house and small barn (both no longer extant) standing on it, indicating {{it had already been}} partly cleared and cultivated. Needing a larger barn to provide storage for hay and feed for his workhorses, Duncan built the large barn in 1910. The family typically planted 50 acre in potatoes, another 50 in hay and oats, and left the remaining land fallow. They kept cows and chickens for personal use (the latter in a shed built {{off the side of the}} barn, which has since been removed). The type of barn Duncan built fell into decline with the advent of mechanized agriculture, for which the large hay and feed storage areas were not needed. Beecher Duncan, who succeeded to the farm after his father's death in 1915, acquired a gasoline-powered tractor in 1944, sold off his workhorses, and removed <b>stalls</b> <b>housing</b> them from the barn.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Time {{budgets for}} 59 mature Holstein cows were {{obtained}} using video analysis over a single 48 h period in 4 two-row free <b>stall</b> <b>housed</b> dairy herds, milked twice a day. Stall design differed only in stall base type with 2 herds with Pasture Mat ® rubber crumb filled mattress stalls and 2 herds with Pack Mat™ stalls – consisting of 2 inches of sand over a mattress. Both stall base and locomotion score significantly influenced stall standing behavior. Lame cows on Pasture Mats lay {{for less than}} 12 h/d {{and stood in the}} stall in excess of 4 h/d. In contrast, while lame cows on Pack Mats maintained lying times at 13. 1 h/d and stood in the stall for less than 2 h/d. The Pack Mat design appears to be very beneficial for lame cows, while Pasture Mat failed to allow lame cows to maintain normal patterns of stall usage. However, the addition of foam to improve surface cushion of the Pasture Mat appeared to improve stall use by both lame and nonlame cows in one herd...|$|R
40|$|Schistosomiasis {{remains of}} {{considerable}} public health concern in many tropical and subtropical {{regions of the}} world, including the People's Republic of China (P. R. China). The effectiveness of schistosomiasis control interventions are, among other factors, governed by the social-ecological context. However, eco-social determinants of schistosomiasis are poorly understood, particularly at the household or village levels. In the current study, residents in 26 villages of Eryuan county, Yunnan province, P. R. China, were screened for Schistosoma japonicum infection with a serological assay {{that was followed by}} stool examination for sero-positive individuals. Bayesian multilevel models with spatial random effects were employed to profile the S. japonicum infection risk based on known transmission sites of S. japonicum that are scattered across individual land parcels {{in this part of the}} country. The key risk factors identified with this approach were the absence of a sanitary <b>stall</b> <b>house</b> for livestock and presence of living and infected intermediate host snails in close proximity. We conclude that a spatially explicit Bayesian multilevel approach can deepen our understanding of eco-social determinants that govern schistosomiasis transmission at a small geographical scale...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{concerns}} about the welfare of farm animals {{is important for the}} development of socially sustainable production practices. This study used an online survey to test how views on group versus <b>stall</b> <b>housing</b> for pregnant sows varied when Canadian and US par-ticipants were provided information about these systems, including access to scientific papers, YouTube videos, Google images, and a frequently-asked-questions page (S 1 Appendix). Initial responses and changes in responses after accessing the information were analyzed from Likert scores of 242 participants and from their written comments. Par-ticipants were less willing to accept the use of gestation stalls after viewing information on sow housing. For example, initially 30. 4 % of respondents indicated that they supported the use of gestation stalls; this declined to 17. 8 % after participants were provided additional information. Qualitative analysis of comments showed that supporters of gestation stalls expressed concern about the spread of disease and aggression between animals in less confined systems, whereas supporters of group housing placed more emphasis on the sow’s ability to interact socially and perform natural behaviors. These results point to public opposition to the use of gestation stalls, and indicate that the more that the public learns about gestation stalls the less willing they will be to accept their use...|$|R

40|$|Increasingly {{governments of}} {{countries}} where homeownership is high {{are looking to}} housing assets to fund long-term care. Housing wealth can be viewed both as an asset for low-income older homeowners and by government as having potential as an asset base for purchasing support services or supplementing income. However, there are several key factors impacting the comparative home equity release options available to older people and these in turn have important policy implications for retirement decisions. For instance, good policy decisions require an understanding of issues pertaining to: national retirement and homeownership patterns; retirement income; the types of equity release products available; and the economic drivers impacting the home equity market. Further, the global recession has impacted retirement savings, and so both the financial market and older {{people are concerned about}} <b>stalled</b> <b>housing</b> prices in some areas and slashed economic growth forecasts. Specifically, a lack of liquidity has severely impacted the financial services sector internationally and has narrowed the choices available. The type and degree of regulation varies among countries that offer equity release products. A systematic and policy review funded by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute forms the basis of this paper. This paper will use the commissioned Australian work to discuss the benefits and dangers of well-established equity release markets, national regulation and will overview the key policy drivers operating {{in the aftermath of the}} global financial crisis...|$|R

Changes in life style expectations, transfer of the farm to the next generation, and inefficient use of labor common in tradition al stall barns has many producers interested in making the move to free stall and parIor systems. However, even the most profitable {{dairy producer}}s (greater than 20, 000 lb/cow/year, 80 to 90 % equity) {{in the region are}} finding it difficult to expand the herd, build a free stall barn, new mil king center, and modem waste handling system all at once.

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} in {{juvenile}} pigs demonstrated {{a relationship between}} the degree of resistance displayed early in life in a so-called "backtest" and parameters of cell-mediated and humoral immunity. Some of the immune characteristics were reported to depend on the interaction between backtest classification and housing system. In the present study, the effects of backtest classification and housing condition on immune reactivity in adult gilts were examined. At 10 and 17 days of age, female piglets were subjected to the backtest. In this test, each piglet is restrained on its back for 1 min and the number of escape attempts is scored. Pigs classified as high resisting (HR) or low resisting (LR) were selected and housed in groups of six gilts. At 7 months of age, half of the gilts were <b>housed</b> in individual <b>stalls.</b> At 12 months of age, gilts were challenged by immunization with DNP-KLH. Control gilts were treated similarly with a placebo. Blood samples were drawn prior to immunization (Day 0) and weekly thereafter until Day 28. No significant effects of backtest type on cellular and Immoral responses against KLH were found. Furthermore, being <b>housed</b> in <b>stalls</b> as compared to groups had no consequences for the immune response and did not induce differences between HR and LR gilts. Differences in behavior and physiology found previously between HR and LR gilts, particularly in gilts in <b>stall</b> <b>housing,</b> may thus be of relatively little importance for immune-related health.

At the farm of high producing Holstein-Friesian cows with tie <b>stall</b> <b>housing</b> and average milk yield of 7000 liters, we followed {{the relation between the}} evaluation of body score condition and the conception rate. Total of 29 Holstein-Frisean cows were included in the study, aged between the first and fifth lactation. Cows were assessed on the basis of three major body areas examination (loin, pin bones and tail head). The evaluation was performed visually and ultrasonically by measuring backfat. Assessment of body condition and backfat measuring were performed at the same day as arteficial insemination. The cows were later divided into two experimental groups, pregnant and non-pregnant. The success rate of conception was 34. 5 %. The results of ultrasound backfat measurements were compatible with the visual assessment of body condition. As such, it represents a simple and objective method. Body condition score for both groups averaged 2. 75. The average thickness of backfat was 16 mm in the group of pregnant cows, and 16. 8 mm in the group of non-pregnant cows.

Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a relatively cheap and easy measuring method to investigate the potential effect of new emission reduction systems. In 2008 and 2009 Wageningen UR Livestock Research preformed emission measurements on 3 different ammonia emission reduction systems using a dynamic flux chamber. All systems were meant for use in a free <b>stall</b> <b>housing</b> system for dairy cows. Two of the emission reduction systems were concrete floors and one was an emission reduction system covering the slurry in the pits. The experiments were conducted at three different practical dairy farms in the Netherlands, one for each system. Emission of the reduction system was related to emission of a references floor. In all cases a concrete slatted floor with slurry pits was used as a reference. Emission levels ranged from 39 % to 71 % of the emission of the reference system. The two systems based on reduction of floors emissions seemed to have more perspective than the system based on reduction of pit emissions. A complete closing of the pits is however an important condition. Because of the case-control character of the flux chamber measurements the results can not be translated directly to full scale emission factors for dairy housing neither can they be used for between farms comparison...|$|R
