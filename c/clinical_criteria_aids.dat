40|$|More than 20 years ago, {{even before}} voters in Oregon had enacted the first aid in dying (AID) statute in the United States, Timothy Quill and colleagues {{proposed}} <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>AID.</b> Their proposal was carefully considered and temperate, {{but there were}} little data on the practice of AID at the time. (With AID, a physician writes a prescription for life-ending medication for a terminally ill, mentally capacitated adult.) With the passage of time, a substantial body of data on AID has developed from the states of Oregon and Washington. For more than 17 years, physicians in Oregon have been authorized to provide a prescription for AID. Accordingly, we have updated the <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> of Quill, et al., based on the many years of experience with AID. With more jurisdictions authorizing AID, {{it is critical that}} physicians can turn to reliable <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria.</b> As with any medical practice, AID must be provided in a safe and effective manner. Physicians need to know (1) how to respond to a patient’s inquiry about AID, (2) how to assess patient decision making capacity, and (3) how to address a range of other issues that may arise. To ensure that physicians have the guidance they need, Compassion 2 ̆ 6 Choices convened the Physician Aid-in-Dying <b>Clinical</b> <b>Criteria</b> Committee, in July 2012, to create <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> for physicians who are willing to provide AID to patients who request it.

40|$|Background: Clinical {{guidelines}} currently {{suggest that}} transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) {{be carried out}} in all patients with suspected endocarditis, {{but the use of}} TTE where there is a low probability of infective endocarditis has a poor diagnostic yield. This screening approach may no longer be appropriate. Objective: To examine whether <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> might <b>aid</b> decision making with respect to the use of TTE in possible endocarditis. Design: A retrospective review of patient records. Setting: Cardiology department of a tertiary referral centre. Patients: 500 consecutive hospital inpatients referred for TTE to exclude endocarditis. Main outcome measures: Evidence of endocardial vegetations on TTE and the presence of predetermined <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> that may predispose to, or be suggestive of, endocarditis. Results: Evidence of infective endocarditis was detected on echocardiography in 43 of the 500 patients (8. 6 %). In 239 patients (48 %), vegetations and certain prespecified <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> were both absent. These criteria were: vasculitic/embolic phenomena; the presence of central venous access; a recent history of injected drug use; presence of a prosthetic valve; and positive blood cultures. The collective absence of these five criteria indicated a zero probability of TTE showing evidence of endocarditis. Conclusions: The use of simple <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> during the decision making process may avoid many unnecessary TTE examinations in hospital inpatients with a low probability of endocarditis...|$|R
40|$|This study {{considers}} a navigation method for finding the most preferable radiotherapy plan from a discrete set using planner-defined <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria.</b> The method {{is based on}} repeatedly solving an optimisation model to identify a plan that best satisfies the aspiration values set by the planner. During navigation, the planner iteratively adjusts the aspiration values to match the preference information learned from previous plans until the most preferable plan is identified. The use of soft constraints to model aspiration values enables navigation among a discrete set and allows the planner to freely specify the aspiration values without producing an infeasible model. We demonstrate {{the use of the}} model by applying it to a prostate cancer case. This illustrates that improvements in optimisation criteria do not necessarily lead to improvements in <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria.</b> Hence the method obviates the need to simultaneously monitor both optimisation and <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> in current navigation systems. Instead, the direct use of <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> for navigation <b>aids</b> the planner to quickly identify the most preferable plan...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Clinicians {{predominantly}} use {{clinical features}} to differentiate type 1 from {{type 2 diabetes}} yet there are no evidence-based <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> to <b>aid</b> classification of patients. Misclassification of diabetes is widespread (7 - 15 % of cases), resulting in patients receiving inappropriate treatment. We sought to identify which <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> {{could be used to}} discriminate type 1 and type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Systematic review of all diagnostic accuracy studies published since 1979 using <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> to predict insulin deficiency (measured by C-peptide). DATA SOURCES: 14 databases including: MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process and EMBASE. The search strategy took the form of: (terms for diabetes) AND (terms for C-Peptide). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Diagnostic accuracy studies of any routinely available clinical predictors against a reference standard of insulin deficiency defined by cut-offs of C-peptide concentrations. No restrictions on race, age, language or country of origin. RESULTS: 10 917 abstracts were screened, and 231 full texts reviewed. 11 studies met inclusion criteria, but varied by age, race, year and proportion of participants who were C-peptide negative. Age at diagnosis was the most discriminatory feature in 7 / 9 studies where it was assessed, with optimal cut-offs (> 70 % mean sensitivity and specificity) across studies being < 30 years or < 40 years. Use of/time to insulin treatment and body mass index (BMI) were also discriminatory. When combining features, BMI added little over age at diagnosis and/or time to insulin (< 1 % improvement in classification). CONCLUSIONS: Despite finding only 11 studies, and considerable heterogeneity between studies, age at diagnosis and time to insulin were consistently the most discriminatory criteria. BMI, despite being widely used in clinical practice, adds little to these two criteria. The criteria identified are similar to the Royal College of General Practitioners National Health Service (RCGP/NHS) Diabetes classification guidelines, which use age at diagnosis < 35 years and time to insulin < 6 m. Until further studies are carried out, these guidelines represent a suitable classification scheme. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO reference CRD 42012001736...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Pulmonary artery {{catheters}} {{are widely}} used invasive monitoring devices in critically ill patients. Clinicians disagree about whether daily chest radiographs are needed or clinical parameters alone are sufficient to verify catheter placement. • OBJECTIVES To determine whether daily chest radiographs are needed to assess migration of pulmonary artery catheters. • METHODS One hundred consecutive patients with pulmonary artery catheters were prospectively evaluated. <b>Clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> for optimal position of the pulmonary artery catheters and findings on chest radiographs were compared. Optimal <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> were (1) amount of air required to measure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure: 1. 25 to 1. 5 mL and (2) pulmonary artery catheter migrated 1 cm or less from initial position. • RESULTS Three hundred ninety comparisons of <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> and radiographic findings were done. Chest radiographs indicated the catheter required repositioning in 15 (4 %) of 390 instances but in only 4 (1 %) of 310 instances in which bedside clinical findings indicated adequate catheter position. In 69 (18 %) of the 390 cases, the <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> for adequate catheter position were not met, but radiographs showed the catheter in an appropriate position. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of abnormal <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> were 73 %, 82 %, 81 %, 14 %, and 99 %, respectively. • CONCLUSIONS Chest radiographs indicated that about 4 % of catheters required repositioning. Catheter malposition can be reliably excluded (negative predictive value, 99 %) by close observation of specific <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria,</b> so routine daily chest radiographs do not seem justified.

Methods This prospective observational cohort study included 175 adult patients who were consecutively referred for a first paroxysmal event and excluding clinically certain syncope faints. Simple descriptive <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> were used by emergency room physicians for epileptic assessment. Follow-up and final diagnosis were made by neurologists specialized in epilepsy. The risk of recurrence and epilepsy over time was described using Kaplan-Meier estimates. The effect of risk factors (including EEG results) was assessed using univariate log-rank tests and a Cox regression multivariate model. Negative and positive predictive values (NPV and PPV) at 1 year of significant factors were calculated. Results <b>Clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> were positive in 67 patients and negative in 108. At 1 year, the rate of recurrence was respectively 8 % in the negative <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> group (NCC) and 30 % in the positive <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> group (PCC) (RR = 9. 3; 95 % CI = [1. 22; 71. 4]). The risk of subsequent epilepsy was respectively 16 % in the NCC group and 57 % in PCC group (RR = 5. 6; 95 % CI = [2. 0; 15. 6]). Positive predictive value (PPV) of <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> was 28. 8 % for recurrence and 57. 6 % for definite epilepsy. Negative predictive value (NPV) of <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> was 93. 2 % for recurrence and 83. 5 % for definite epilepsy. The presence of significant abnormalities on early EEG (paroxysms or focal abnormalities) supported an epileptic origin in 17 % of clinically uncertain seizures.

Immediately after death, multiple bilateral lung biopsy specimens (16 specimens/patient) were obtained for histological examination and quantitative lung cultures. The presence of both histological pneumonia and positive lung cultures was used as a reference test.  RESULTS—The presence of infiltrates on the chest radiograph and two of three <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> (leucocytosis, purulent secretions, fever) had a sensitivity of 69 % and a specificity of 75 %; the corresponding numbers for the clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) were 77 % and 42 %.

The combination of all techniques achieved a sensitivity of 85 % and a specificity of 50 %, and these values remained virtually unchanged despite the presence of previous treatment with antibiotics. When microbiological results were added to <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria,</b> adequate diagnoses originating from microbiological results which might have corrected false positive and false negative clinical judgements (n = 5) were countered by a similar proportion of inadequate diagnoses (n = 6).  CONCLUSIONS—Clinical criteria had reasonable diagnostic values.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To re-assess {{the value}} of CT and <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> as {{prognostic}} and severity indicators in acute pancreatitis and the correlation between them. METHODS: Sixty-five cases with acute pancreatitis (AP) {{were included in the}} study. The hospitalization days, fevering days and overall complications were regarded as clinical endpoints for the patient group. CT criteria used for AP evaluation included Balthazar's plain CT scan score, CT severity index (CTSI) and London's pancreatic size index (PSI) score. <b>Clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> was Ranson score. The correlations between each <b>criterion</b> and the <b>clinical</b> endpoints, and the relation between CT and <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> were analyzed. The power of each criterion and combination of CT and <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria</b> in predicting overall complications of AP were assessed and compared by using a receiver operative characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The mean scores of PSI, Ranson among the three groups classified according to overall complications were significantly different. Except Balthazar's plain CT scan criterion, each criterion's mean score in-groups with local complications was significantly higher than that in-group without. The overall complications were significantly more in severe group than that in mild group classified according to each criterion except plain CT scan criterion. Mean days of hospital stay and fevering were significantly longer in severe group with Ranson score than that in mild group. PSI and Ranson score had a linear correlation with fevering days, and Ranson score had a linear correlation with hospitalization days. In CT criteria, only PSI had a linear correlation with Ranson score. The findings of plain CT scan was found to be some laggard compared with that of clinic. ROC analysis showed the largest A(Z) of Ranson score, and there was no A(Z) increase when CT criteria were added to <b>clinical</b> <b>criteria.</b> CONCLUSION: The predictive values of Ranson and PSI score in AP patients are superior to that of other criteria.
