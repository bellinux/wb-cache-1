40|$|Signal {{injection}} method (SIM) {{is widely}} {{applied to the}} insulation parameters’ measurement in distribution network for its convenience and safety. It {{can be divided into}} two kinds of patterns: injecting a specific frequency signal or several frequencies’ groups, and scanning frequency in a scheduled frequency scope. In order to avoid the disadvantages in related researches, improved signal injection method (ISIM), in which the frequency characteristic of the transformer magnetizing impedance is taken into consideration, is proposed. In addition, optimization for signal injection position has been accomplished, and the corresponding three <b>calculation</b> <b>methods</b> of line-to-ground capacitance has been derived. Calculations are carried out through the vector information (vector <b>calculation</b> <b>method),</b> the amplitude information (amplitude <b>calculation</b> <b>method),</b> the phase information (phase <b>calculation</b> <b>method)</b> of voltage and current in signal injecting port, respectively. The line-to-ground capacitance is represented by lumped parameter capacitances in high-voltage simulation test. Eight different sinusoidal signals are injected into zero-sequence circuit, and then line-to-ground capacitance is calculated with the above-mentioned vector <b>calculation</b> <b>method</b> based on the voltage and the current data of the injecting port. The results obtained by the vector <b>calculation</b> <b>method</b> show that ISIM has a wider application frequency range compared with signal injection method with rated parameters (RSIM) and SIM. The RSIM is calculated with the rated transformer parameters of magnetizing impedance, and the SIM based on the ideal transformer model, and the relative errors of calculation results of ISIM are smaller than that for other methods in general. The six groups of two-frequency set are chosen in a specific scope which is recommended by vector calculation results. Based on ISIM, the line-to-ground capacitance calculations through the amplitude <b>calculation</b> <b>method</b> and phase <b>calculation</b> <b>method</b> are compared, and then its application frequency range, which can work as a guidance for line-to-ground capacitance measurement, is concluded...|$|R
