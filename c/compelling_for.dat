Although the long duration of rebreathers seems <b>compelling</b> <b>for</b> bail-out, rebreathers are relatively bulky, complex, vulnerable to damage and require more time to start breathing from, than easy-to-use, instantly available, robust and reliable open-circuit equipment.|$|E

500|$|Jay Carr of The Boston Globe called Apt Pupil [...] "most <b>compelling</b> <b>for</b> {{its moral}} dimension", enjoying the [...] "duet between Renfro's smooth-cheeked latter-day Faust and McKellen's reawakened Mephistopheles". While Carr found the film's {{framework}} to be realistic, {{he noted the}} change of pace, [...] "Perhaps sensing a narrative slackening and a smothering claustrophobia... 'Apt Pupil' veers into melodramatic devices that yank the film out of its disquieting amorality {{and turn it into}} something much more ordinary and mundane." [...] The critic concluded, [...] "It maintains a bleak integrity by not pretending to arrive at remorse. Never is there any discussion." [...] Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune described Apt Pupil as [...] "a good shocker that misses the ultimate horror", finding the film's weakness to be the [...] "contrived" [...] bond between Dussander and Bowden. [...] Wilmington called the plot [...] "overly slick", asking, [...] "How can Todd not only conveniently find a Nazi war criminal in his hometown but also instantly coerce and control him?" ...|$|E

500|$|In early {{seasons of}} Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Cordelia was often used both as comic relief and {{occasionally}} for the damsel in distress plot device, {{which would require}} series' heroine Buffy to save her. Any concerns that she was simply one-dimensional were alleviated for the actress when writers developed the character through her relationships with Xander and later Wesley, which led Carpenter to become more convinced of her potential. In {{an article about the}} psychology of characters in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Steven C. Schlozman writes about how [...] "Cordelia is wealthy and, at first glance, superficial, appearing to care most about her own popularity. However, as the show progresses, we learn that her mother suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome and her father was prosecuted for income tax evasion. She is a reluctant participant, baffled at her own loyal feelings and bewildered at her attraction to the unpopular Xander." [...] He goes on to describe how Cordelia, and [...] "all the characters of Buffy the Vampire Slayer are particularly <b>compelling</b> <b>for</b> their depictions of important adolescent themes." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} The Daily Telegraph commented that [...] "the main failure of Guest's {{otherwise}} excellent {{book is the}} absence of character: even his mother comes across rather as a history than a personality." [...] "My Life in Orange, though slightly patchwork in its construction, is an absorbing piece of writing, all the more <b>compelling</b> <b>for</b> begging as many questions as it answers and for the author's refusal to ask for pity," [...] wrote Geraldine Bedell in a review of the book in The Observer. Director of the Cheltenham Festival of Literature, Christopher Cook, characterized My Life in Orange as [...] "the most extraordinary account of his [...] childhood and the bravest writing I've read in ages". Sudipta Datta of the Indian Express described the book as [...] "a postcard from the past that the Osho ashram may not rave about." [...] Datta noted though that after having been angry with his mother and Rajneesh, Guest had reconciled with his family, reclaimed his childhood and come to see Rajneesh as [...] "a loveable rogue who got away with doing his own thing". Catherine A. Powers of The Boston Globe characterized the book as a [...] "moving, superbly written account of growing up in the midst of ... cruel madness". Michael E. Young of The Dallas Morning News gave the book a favorable review, and wrote: [...] "The book offers a glimpse into the thoughts of the followers, and examines the fine line between spirituality and insanity, between religion and cult." [...] Shane Hegarty of The Irish Times characterized the book as [...] "an intriguing and often humorous mix of straightforward 1980s nostalgia and cult delusion".|$|E
500|$|On Victor's {{rivalry with}} Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Allison Waldman of AOL TV said: [...] "After all, their characters' on screen feud {{has been the}} stuff of soap legend. Victor and Jack have shared wives, corporations, but mostly, unabashed hatred. They despise each other." [...] Additionally, Waldman wrote: [...] "Braeden's {{contribution}} to the show these past three decades really cannot be understated. He's been a driving force as Victor primarily because he's a villain who's not quite pure evil. He has a heart and on occasion shows a vulnerability that makes him likable and even sympathetic" [...] but [...] "like a big jungle cat, he is not one to be tamed. That's why at any point, Victor can turn on someone he once professed to love [...] See, that's Victor. He makes viewers crazy with his actions, but he's so dynamic and interesting, that you can't stop watching him. Thank you, Eric Braeden. You are Victor and you have made him completely <b>compelling</b> <b>for</b> 30 years." [...] In another article, Waldman called Braeden {{one of the biggest}} stars in the soap opera business. Victor has adopted several nicknames on the show that have carried into the media. This includes [...] "The Mustache" [...] and [...] "The Dark Night". When asked which storyline he felt affinity for or strongly about in his thirty years during an interview with AOL TV, Braeden stated it was the scenes in which he met his dying mother, Cora Miller (Dorothy McGuire), {{for the first time since}} he was seven years old. The actor credited it as the turning point of his career on the show, describing it as [...] "a deeply-felt scene" [...] and something he would never forget. He said: ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{reality of}} tightly shared accommodations, with {{numerous}} families occupying rooms {{in a single}} crowded [...] "long house," [...] proved less than <b>compelling</b> <b>for</b> {{many members of the}} phalanx's resident community. The community was sharply divided over the matter of the construction of new collective living quarters as opposed to comfortable accommodation for individual families, while an increasing number of committed vegetarians made common dining increasingly impractical. Moreover, the lack of a proper reading room galled many of the intellectual members of the group.|$|E
2500|$|PopMatters' Adrien Begrand {{found that}} Seventh Tree [...] "might be a quieter and more introspective disc than we'd been expecting, {{but this is}} still a quintessential Goldfrapp album with Gregory's {{arrangements}} brilliantly underscoring the inimitable vocal versatility of his female foil." [...] Despite being critical of Alison Goldfrapp's [...] "wispy, ethereal, often impenetrable vocal approach", Dave Hughes of Slant Magazine opined that the album is [...] "most <b>compelling</b> <b>for</b> {{the way in which the}} band's regained austerity and naturalism contrasts with their more recent hedonism." [...] Kat Lister of the NME expressed that [...] "Seventh Tree is bound to ruffle a few electro-feathered fans, but there's no denying it's a venture that sets the pair into new experimental territory." [...] In a mixed review, Rolling Stones Christian Hoard felt that the [...] "slow pace can be a snooze", but wrote that the album [...] "still makes for good post-party chill-out music". Nate Patrin of Pitchfork Media was less impressed, stating that the album's ambience is [...] "so subtle and slow-moving it doesn't seem to go anywhere, and it coasts on some frothy sense of pleasantness that evaporates the moment the song ends." ...|$|E
2500|$|As [...] "library/thesis" [...] precedents, Rader {{cited the}} Federal Circuit case In re Bayer, which had {{held that a}} {{graduate}} school thesis {{that had not been}} cataloged or placed on library shelves, and that was only known to the three faculty members who served on the thesis committee, did not qualify as a printed publication. Rader also cited the Federal Circuit case In re Cronyn, in which a thesis was placed in a library and indexed by the author's last name, and was determined not to qualify as a printed publication. Rader acknowledged that SRI International had elements in common with In Re Bayer. His analysis likened the uncatalogued nature of the thesis in the library to the posting of the Live Traffic paper on an FTP server which did not allow for searching and did not contain an index. According to Rader, the fact that Porras emailed direct links to those accessing the papers showed that a person skilled in the field {{would not have been able}} to access the Live Traffic Paper. Moreover, Rader argued that the public accessibility was less <b>compelling</b> <b>for</b> SRI International than it was for In re Bayer, as the document in the former case was in pre-publication review, while the thesis in the latter had already been completed.|$|E

60|$|The cub {{had never}} seen man, yet the {{instinct}} concerning man was his. In dim ways he recognised in man the animal that had fought itself to primacy over the other animals of the Wild. Not alone {{out of his own}} eyes, but out of the eyes of all his ancestors was the cub now looking upon man--out of eyes that had circled in the darkness around countless winter camp-fires, that had peered from safe distances and from the hearts of thickets at the strange, two-legged animal that was lord over living things. The spell of the cub's heritage was upon him, the fear and the respect born of the centuries of struggle and the accumulated experience of the generations. The heritage was too <b>compelling</b> <b>for</b> a wolf that was only a cub. Had he been full-grown, he would have run away. As it was, he cowered down in a paralysis of fear, already half proffering the submission that his kind had proffered from the first time a wolf came in to sit by man's fire and be made warm.|$|E
