This motorcycle was almost identical to the 1970 to 1973 CL100, that was really only a slight modification of the CB series produced at the same time.

50|$|On 16 March 2006 the Royal Malaysian Navy test {{fired the}} Sea Skua missile {{as part of}} a {{contractual}} Firing exercise. The missile was fired eight miles down range from the 40m Surface Target Barge. The Sea Skua failed to hit its target and failed to explode. The fault was believed to have been traced to a faulty <b>connecting</b> <b>pin</b> wire that ignites the rocket motor. The missile fell into the sea, and was not recovered. The Royal Malaysian Navy ordered Matra Bae Dynamics (MBDA) to take back the missiles to conduct system checks, and re-tested.|$|E
50|$|The {{report found}} that the 7:40 railmotor train had a few {{shortcomings}} related to its equipment. The train could be stopped faster if it were running engine first because the driver could use the brake valve in the engine instead of the somewhat less effective brake valve in the autocoach. Also, {{the way that the}} mechanical linkages were arranged that connected the regulator control from the driving trailer was somewhat unreliable in that there was play in the system that prevented the regulator from being opened fully. There was also an issue where a <b>connecting</b> <b>pin</b> in the regulator linkage was prone to falling out.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a simple}} LED package, {{typically}} {{all of the}} cathodes (negative terminals) {{or all of the}} anodes (positive terminals) of the segment LEDs are connected and brought out to a common pin; this is referred to as a [...] "common cathode" [...] or [...] "common anode" [...] device. Hence a 7 segment plus decimal point package will only require nine pins, though commercial products typically contain more pins, and/or spaces where pins would go, in order to match standard IC sockets. Integrated displays also exist, with single or multiple digits. Some of these integrated displays incorporate their own internal decoder, though most do not: each individual LED is brought out to a <b>connecting</b> <b>pin</b> as described.Multiple-digit LED displays as used in pocket calculators and similar devices used multiplexed displays {{to reduce the number of}} I/O pins required to control the display. For example, all the anodes of the A segments of each digit position would be connected together and to a driver circuit pin, while the cathodes of all segments for each digit would be connected. To operate any particular segment of any digit, the controlling integrated circuit would turn on the cathode driver for the selected digit, and the anode drivers for the desired segments; then after a short blanking interval the next digit would be selected and new segments lit, in a sequential fashion. In this manner an eight digit display with seven segments and a decimal point would require only 8 cathode drivers and 8 anode drivers, instead of sixty-four drivers and IC pins. Often in pocket calculators the digit drive lines would be used to scan the keyboard as well, providing further savings; however, pressing multiple keys at once would produce odd results on the multiplexed display.|$|E
50|$|Thor {{boosters}} {{launched from}} SLC-10W used an erector system to hoist {{them up to}} the pad. While common on Soviet launch vehicles, this method was unusual in the US space program. Thor 304 had been erected on the pad a few weeks before launch, and during this step, a <b>connecting</b> <b>pin</b> in the erector broke and sent the rocket falling back down to ground level. Launch crews examined the Thor for damage, but could not find any outward indication of it. The booster passed routine preflight systems checks and liftoff took place at 6:22 PM PST on July 14. Shortly after liftoff, the Thor's telemetry system failed, but weather conditions and visibility were excellent, and the booster could be tracked visually for over two minutes. Telemetry from the DMSP satellite indicated that it was operating properly. SECO took place on time, as did the second stage burn. Third stage burn began, and then after about four seconds, all telemetry abruptly ceased. The initial assumption was that the third stage exploded, and initial Air Force press releases about the launch stated such. However, radar tracking showed that the third stage motor continued operating as it drove the DMSP into the Pacific Ocean. The investigation board concluded that connectors in the electrical interface between the second and third stage had been jolted loose by the erector mishap several weeks earlier. After second stage burnout, staging failed to take place due to the misaligned connectors, and the third stage motor thus fired with the spent second stage still attached to it. The force from the third stage motor burning managed to tear the second stage free, but in doing so, it ripped out wiring in the base of the third stage, which shorted out the guidance computer and caused it to direct the stage and spacecraft down into the ocean. Much like the DMSP failure in 1976, the incident was attributed to poor program management.|$|E
