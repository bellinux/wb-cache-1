25|$|Rennet is {{a mixture}} of enzymes used to {{coagulate}} milk into cheese. Originally it was available only from the fourth stomach of calves, and was scarce and expensive, or was available from microbial sources, which often produced unpleasant tastes. Genetic engineering made it possible to extract rennet-producing genes from animal stomachs and insert them into bacteria, fungi or yeasts to make them produce <b>chymosin,</b> the key enzyme. The modified microorganism is killed after fermentation. <b>Chymosin</b> is isolated from the fermentation broth, so that the Fermentation-Produced <b>Chymosin</b> (FPC) used by cheese producers has an amino acid sequence that is identical to bovine rennet. The majority of the applied <b>chymosin</b> is retained in the whey. Trace quantities of <b>chymosin</b> may remain in cheese.|$|E
25|$|The first genetically {{modified}} plant was produced in 1983, using an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant. Genetically modified microbial enzymes were the first application of {{genetically modified}} organisms in food production and were approved in 1988 by the US Food and Drug Administration. In the early 1990s, recombinant <b>chymosin</b> was approved for use in several countries. Cheese had typically been made using the enzyme complex rennet that had been extracted from cows' stomach lining. Scientists modified bacteria to produce <b>chymosin,</b> which was also able to clot milk, resulting in cheese curds.|$|E
25|$|The curds and whey are {{separated}} using rennet, an enzyme complex normally produced from the stomachs of newborn calves (in vegetarian or kosher cheeses, bacterial, yeast or mould-derived <b>chymosin</b> is used).|$|E
5000|$|Recombinant <b>chymosin</b> [...] Found in rennet, <b>chymosin</b> is {{an enzyme}} {{required}} to manufacture cheese. It {{was the first}} genetically engineered food additive used commercially. Traditionally, processors obtained <b>chymosin</b> from rennet, a preparation derived from the fourth stomach of milk-fed calves. Scientists engineered a non-pathogenic strain (K-12) of E. coli bacteria for large-scale laboratory production of the enzyme. This microbiologically produced recombinant enzyme, identical structurally to the calf derived enzyme, costs less and is produced in abundant quantities. Today about 60% of U.S. hard cheese is made with genetically engineered <b>chymosin.</b> In 1990, FDA granted <b>chymosin</b> [...] "generally recognized as safe" [...] (GRAS) status based on data showing that the enzyme was safe.|$|E

50|$|Besides E. coli and A. niger var awamori, K.lactis {{is one of}} {{the main}} organisms grown in {{industry}} in fermenters to produce <b>chymosin</b> on a large scale. <b>Chymosin</b> is used for cheese production.|$|E
50|$|When calf-rennet grew {{scarce in}} the 1960s, {{scientists}} developed a synthesized type of <b>Chymosin</b> by fermenting certain bacteria or fungi (microbial rennet), but this also was not useful {{for all types}} of cheese-making. A solution using recombinant-gene (GMO microbial rennet) technology was developed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1990. This splices the calf-gene for producing <b>chymosin</b> into the genes of certain bacteria, yeasts or fungi, producing pure <b>chymosin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the above}} {{imperfections}} of microbial and animal rennets, many producers sought other replacements of rennet. With genetic engineering it became possible to isolate rennet genes from animals and introduce them into certain bacteria, fungi, or yeasts to make them produce <b>chymosin</b> during fermentation. The genetically modified microorganism is killed after fermentation and <b>chymosin</b> isolated from the fermentation broth, so that the fermentation-produced <b>chymosin</b> (FPC) used by cheese producers does not contain a GMO or any GMO DNA. FPC is identical to <b>chymosin</b> made by an animal, but is produced in a more efficient way. FPC products {{have been on the}} market since 1990 and have been considered in the last 20 years the ideal milk-clotting enzyme.|$|E

5000|$|Charge {{interactions}} between histidines on the kappa-casein and glutamates and aspartates of <b>chymosin</b> initiate enzyme binding to the substrate. [...] When <b>chymosin</b> is not binding substrate, a beta-hairpin, {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "the flap," [...] can hydrogen bond with the active site, therefore covering it and not allowing further binding of substrate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chymosin</b> is {{produced}} by ruminant animals in {{the lining of the}} abomasum. <b>Chymosin</b> {{is produced}} by gastric chief cells in young ruminants and some other newborn animals to curdle the milk they ingest, allowing a longer residence in the bowels and better absorption. Some other non-ruminant species, including pigs, cats, and seals, produce it.|$|E
50|$|CHY-MAX is Genetically Engineered bovine <b>chymosin</b> {{produced}} by the biotech company Chr. Hansen A/S. CHY-MAX is {{produced by}} fermentation of the fungus Aspergillus niger. Bovine <b>chymosin</b> is an enzyme that causes milk to curdle. Being a non animal derived product, CHY-MAX is suitable for consumption by vegetarians, {{as well as for}} production of cheese certified Kosher or Halal.|$|E
50|$|While rennet was {{traditionally}} produced via extraction {{from the}} inner mucosa of the fourth stomach chamber of slaughtered young, unweaned calves, most rennet used today in cheesemaking is produced recombinantly. The majority of the applied <b>chymosin</b> is retained in the whey and, at most, may be present in cheese in trace quantities. In ripe cheese, the type and provenance of <b>chymosin</b> used in production cannot be determined.|$|E
5000|$|Rennet [...] is {{a complex}} of enzymes {{produced}} in the stomachs of ruminant mammals. <b>Chymosin,</b> its key component, is a protease enzyme that curdles the casein in milk. This helps young mammals digest their mothers' milk. Rennet {{can also be used}} to separate milk into solid curds for cheesemaking and liquid whey. In addition to <b>chymosin,</b> rennet contains other important enzymes such as pepsin and a lipase.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chymosin</b> [...] or rennin [...] is a {{protease}} {{found in}} rennet. It is an aspartic endopeptidase belonging to MEROPS A1 family. It {{is produced by}} newborn ruminant animals in {{the lining of the}} abomasum to curdle the milk they ingest, allowing a longer residence in the bowels and better absorption. It is widely used in the production of cheese. Bovine <b>chymosin</b> is now produced recombinantly in , Aspergillus niger var awamori, and [...] as alternative resource.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chymosin</b> is used {{to bring}} about the {{extensive}} precipitation and curd formation in cheese-making. The native substrate of <b>chymosin</b> is K-casein which is specifically cleaved at the peptide bond between amino acid residues 105 and 106, phenylalanine and methionine. The resultant product is calcium phosphocaseinate. When the specific linkage between the hydrophobic (para-casein) and hydrophilic (acidic glycopeptide) groups of casein is broken, the hydrophobic groups unite and form a 3D network that traps the aqueous phase of the milk.|$|E
50|$|The pizzas have {{contained}} a genetically-modified version of <b>chymosin</b> {{since the late}} 1990s, as {{this was the only}} vegetarian rennet it could find.|$|E
50|$|Cheeses {{produced}} with FPC can be certified kosher and halal, and {{are suitable for}} vegetarians if no animal-based alimentation was used during the <b>chymosin</b> production in the fermenter.|$|E

50|$|Unlike many proteins, casein is not coagulated by heat. During {{the process}} of clotting, milk-clotting proteases act on the soluble portion of the caseins, κ-casein, thus {{originating}} an unstable micellar state that results in clot formation. When coagulated with <b>chymosin,</b> casein is sometimes called paracasein. <b>Chymosin</b> (EC 3.4.23.4) is an aspartic protease that specifically hydrolyzes the peptide bond in Phe105-Met106 of κ-casein, and {{is considered to be}} the most efficient protease for the cheese-making industry (Rao et al., 1998). British terminology, on the other hand, uses the term caseinogen for the uncoagulated protein and casein for the coagulated protein. As it exists in milk, it is a salt of calcium.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chymosin</b> (EC 3.4.23.4) is an aspartic {{protease}} {{that specifically}} hydrolyzes the peptide bond in Phe105-Met106 of κ- casein {{and is considered}} to be the most efficient protease for the cheesemaking industry. However, there are milk-clotting proteases able to cleave other peptide bonds in the κ-casein chain, such as the endothiapepsin produced by Endothia parasitica. There are also several milk-clotting proteases that, being able to cleave the Phe105-Met106 bond in the κ-casein molecule, also cleave other peptide bonds in other caseins, such as those produced by Cynara cardunculus or even bovine <b>chymosin.</b> This allows the manufacture of different cheeses with a variety of rheological and organoleptic properties.|$|E
50|$|FPC {{contains}} only <b>chymosin</b> B, achieving {{a high degree}} of purity compared with animal rennet. FPC can deliver several benefits to the cheese producer compared with animal or microbial rennet, such as higher production yield, better curd texture and reduced bitterness.|$|E
50|$|FPC is <b>chymosin</b> B, so is more pure than animal rennet, which {{contains}} {{a multitude of}} proteins. FPC can provide several benefits to the cheese producer compared with animal or microbial rennet, such as higher production yield, better curd texture, and reduced bitterness.|$|E
5000|$|One study {{claimed to}} find a chymosin-like enzyme in some human infants, but others have failed to {{replicate}} this finding. Humans have a pseudogene for <b>chymosin</b> that does not generate a protein, found on chromosome 1. [...] Humans have other proteins to digest milk, such as pepsin and lipase.|$|E
50|$|In addition, various genetically {{engineered}} micro-organisms are routinely used {{as sources of}} enzymes for the manufacture {{of a variety of}} processed foods. These include alpha-amylase from bacteria, which converts starch to simple sugars, <b>chymosin</b> from bacteria or fungi, which clots milk protein for cheese making, and pectinesterase from fungi, which improves fruit juice clarity.|$|E
50|$|By 2008, {{approximately}} 80% to 90% of commercially made cheeses in the US and Britain {{were made}} using FPC. Today, {{the most widely}} used fermentation-produced <b>chymosin</b> is produced either by the fungus Aspergillus niger and commercialized under the trademark CHY-MAX® by the Danish company Chr. Hansen, or produced by Kluyveromyces lactis and commercialized under the trademark MAXIREN® by the Dutch company DSM.|$|E
50|$|Many {{plants have}} coagulating properties. Homer {{suggests}} in the Iliad that the Greeks used an extract of fig juice to coagulate milk. Other examples include {{several species of}} Galium, dried caper leaves, nettles, thistles, mallow, and ground ivy. Enzymes from thistle or Cynara are used in some traditional cheese production in the Mediterranean. Phytic acid, derived from unfermented soybeans, or fermentation-produced <b>chymosin</b> (FPC) may also be used.|$|E
50|$|Kluyveromyces lactis (formerly Saccharomyces lactis) is a yeast {{which has}} the ability to {{assimilate}} lactose and convert it into lactic acid. K. lactis and other organisms i.e., Aspergillus niger var awamori and Escherichia coli K-12 are grown in fermenters to produce <b>chymosin</b> (rennet) on a commercial scale; this rennet, which replaces the conventional form obtained from slaughtered animals, is now widely used in cheese production.|$|E
50|$|Kluyveromyces lactis is a yeast {{regularly}} {{used for}} the production of kefir. It can grow on several sugars, most importantly on lactose which is present in milk and whey. It has successfully been applied among others to the production of <b>chymosin</b> (an enzyme that is usually present in the stomach of calves) {{for the production of}} cheese. Production takes place in fermenters on a 40,000 L scale.|$|E
5000|$|A gastric {{chief cell}} (or peptic cell, or gastric zymogenic cell) {{is a type}} of cell in the stomach that {{releases}} pepsinogen and gastric lipase and is the cell responsible for secretion of <b>chymosin</b> in ruminants. The cell stains basophilic upon H&E staining due to the large proportion of rough endoplasmic reticulum in its cytoplasm. Gastric chief cells are generally located deep in the mucosal layer of the stomach lining.|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{the limited}} {{availability}} of mammalian stomachs for rennet production, cheese makers have sought other ways to coagulate milk since at least Roman times. The many sources of enzymes {{that can be a}} substitute for animal rennet range from plants and fungi to microbial sources. [...] Cheeses produced from any of these varieties of rennet are suitable for lactovegetarians. Fermentation-produced <b>chymosin</b> is used more often in industrial cheesemaking in North America and Europe today because it is less expensive than animal rennet.|$|E
5000|$|Genetically {{modified}} microbial enzymes {{were the}} first application of genetically modified organisms in food production and were approved in 1988 by the US Food and Drug Administration. In the early 1990s, recombinant <b>chymosin</b> was approved for use in several countries. [...] Cheese had typically been made using the enzyme complex rennet that had been extracted from cows' stomach lining. Scientists modified bacteria to produce <b>chymosin,</b> which was also able to clot milk, resulting in cheese curds. The People’s Republic of China was the first country to commercialize transgenic plants, introducing a virus-resistant tobacco in 1992. In 1994 Calgene attained approval to commercially release the Flavr Savr tomato, a tomato engineered to have a longer shelf life. Also in 1994, the European Union approved tobacco engineered to be resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil, making it the first genetically engineered crop commercialized in Europe. In 1995 Bt Potato was approved safe by the Environmental Protection Agency, after having {{been approved by the}} FDA, making it the first pesticide producing crop to be approved in the USA. In 1996 a total of 35 approvals had been granted to commercially grow 8 transgenic crops and one flower crop (carnation), with 8 different traits in 6 countries plus the EU.|$|E
50|$|Rennet is {{an enzyme}} that was {{traditionally}} {{collected from the}} stomach of a milk-fed calf (natural rennet). This enzyme {{is responsible for the}} coagulation of the milk proteins to produce curds. Cheese produced this way is neither vegetarian nor Kosher. Coagulation can also be achieved using acids, but this method yields lower-quality Cheddar. The two key components of natural rennet are <b>chymosin</b> and bovine pepsin. Extracts from plants such as nettles were found to produce similar effects and have been used in some types of cheese-making (vegetable rennet).|$|E
50|$|When {{during the}} {{fermentation}} the cheesemaker has gauged that sufficient lactic acid has been developed, rennet {{is added to}} cause the casein to precipitate. Rennet contains the enzyme <b>chymosin</b> which converts κ-casein to para-κ-caseinate (the main component of cheese curd, which is a salt of one fragment of the casein) and glycomacropeptide, which is lost in the cheese whey. As the curd is formed, milk fat is trapped in a casein matrix. After adding the rennet, the cheese milk is left to form curds {{over a period of}} time.|$|E
50|$|The gastric {{chief cell}} (also {{known as a}} zymogenic cell or peptic cell) is a cell in the stomach that {{releases}} pepsinogen and <b>chymosin.</b> Pepsinogen is activated into the digestive enzyme pepsin when it comes in contact with acid produced by gastric parietal cells. This type of cell also secretes gastric lipase enzymes, which help digest triglycerides into free fatty acids and di- and mono-glycerides. There is also evidence that the gastric chief cell secretes leptin {{in response to the}} presence of food in the stomach. Leptin has been found in the pepsinogen granules of chief cells.|$|E
