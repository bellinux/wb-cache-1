5|$|After seeing Ned Flanders reject {{an offer}} from a crooked <b>cable</b> man to get an illegal <b>cable</b> hook-up for $50, Homer chases after the <b>cable</b> man and takes the offer. Homer likes the new {{channels}} and {{spends a lot of}} time watching the television along with his family. Lisa, however, feels suspicious about the <b>cable</b> hook-up. Following a Sunday school lesson regarding the existence and nature of Hell, Lisa becomes terrified of violations of the Ten Commandments, the adherence to which she is assured will keep one's soul safe from Hell. She fears that because Homer violated the Eighth Commandment, he will go to Hell when he dies.|$|E

5|$|Brody {{runs into}} Mike, who tells {{his father that}} Sean is with his friends, {{drifting}} towards <b>Cable</b> Junction, a small island housing an electrical relay station, and apologizes for disobeying him and putting Sean in danger. Brody accepts his apology while telling him to get to safety and quickly finds them, but when the shark returns, he panics and maroons the police boat on <b>Cable</b> Junction. He then tries to pull them in with a winch but hooks an underwater power <b>cable.</b> The shark's next attack sends most of the teenagers into the water, and they swim to <b>Cable</b> Junction while Sean and Jackie are trapped on the boats. Using an inflatable raft, Brody hits the power <b>cable</b> with an oar to attract the shark, and encourages it to bite the cable; the shark is fatally electrocuted, and its body sinks {{to the bottom of}} the sea. The kids rejoice as Brody picks up Sean and Jackie, and they join them on <b>Cable</b> Junction to await rescue.|$|E

5|$|HDMI {{manufacturers}} pay {{an annual}} fee of US$10,000 plus a royalty rate of $0.15 per unit, reduced to $0.05 if the HDMI logo is used, and further reduced to $0.04 if HDCP is also implemented. An alternative fee for HDMI manufacturers making fewer than 10,000 units per year is an annual fee of $5,000 with a royalty rate of $1 per unit.

40|$|<b>Cables</b> is a cyclin-dependent kinase-binding nuclear {{protein that}} maps to {{chromosome}} 18 q 11 - 12. Here, we assessed <b>Cables</b> expression in 160 colorectal cancers (CRCs), its role in colon cancer cell growth, and the potential mechanisms of <b>Cables</b> inactivation. Expression levels, promoter methylation, and mutational status of <b>Cables</b> were investigated in colon cancer cell lines and primary colon tumors. Chromosome 18 q loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was evaluated with multiple polymorphic markers. <b>Cables</b> inhibited cellular proliferation and colony formation in colon cancer cell lines. <b>Cables</b> expression was reduced in 65 % of primary CRCs. No mutations were detected in 10 exons of <b>Cables</b> in 20 primary colon tumors. <b>Cables</b> promoter was methylated in cell lines with decreased <b>Cables</b> expression and vice versa. 5 -Aza- 2 ′-deoxycytidine resulted in increased <b>Cables</b> expression in methylated cell lines. There was a significant correlation between promoter methylation and <b>Cables</b> gene expression in primary colon tumors. Sixty-five percent of primary colon tumors demonstrated chromosome 18 q LOH. LOH involving the <b>Cables</b> region was observed in 35 % of cases, including those in which more distal portions of chromosome 18 q were retained, and <b>Cables</b> expression was decreased in all such cases. Loss of <b>Cables</b> expression in 65 % of CRCs {{suggests that it is}} a common event in colonic carcinogenesis, with promoter methylation and LOH appearing to be important mechanisms of <b>Cables</b> gene inactivation...|$|R

5|$|Northrop Grumman and Raytheon {{decided in}} 2002 to locate its ground station for National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the {{successor}} of EOS, to Helsinki, Finland, instead of Svalbard.

The <b>cable</b> was financed by the satellite operators paying the same fee for the transmission of data {{as they would have}} to pay for a satellite connection until the <b>cable</b> was paid for.

40|$|In this study, {{the scope}} of CFRP <b>cables</b> in {{cable-stayed}} bridges is studied by establishing a numerical model of a 1400 -m span of the same. The mechanical properties and characteristics of CFRP stay <b>cables</b> and of a cable-stayed bridge with CFRP <b>cables</b> are here subjected to comprehensive analysis. The anomalies in the damping properties of free vibration, nonlinear parametric vibration and wind fluctuating vibration between steel <b>cables</b> and CFRP <b>cables</b> are determined. The structural stiffness, wind resistance and traffic vibration of the cable-stayed bridge with CFRP <b>cables</b> are also analyzed. It {{was found that the}} static performances of a cable-stayed bridge with CFRP <b>cables</b> and steel <b>cables</b> are basically the same. The natural frequencies of CFRP <b>cables</b> do not coincide with the major natural frequencies of the cable-stayed bridge, so the likelihood of CFRP cable-bridge coupling vibration is minuscule. For CFRP <b>cables,</b> the response amplitudes of both parametric vibration and wind fluctuating vibration are smaller than those of steel <b>cables.</b> It can be concluded from the research that the use of CFRP <b>cables</b> does not change the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle-bridge coupling vibration. Therefore, they can be used in long-span cable-stayed bridges with an excellent mechanical performance...|$|R
