40|$|Abstract. The {{two most}} {{prominent}} features of early visual processing are orientation selective filtering and <b>contrast</b> gain <b>control.</b> While {{the effect of}} orientation selectivity can be assessed within in a linear model, <b>contrast</b> gain <b>control</b> is an inherently nonlinear computation. Here we employ the class of Lp elliptically contoured dis-tributions to investigate {{the extent to which}} the two features, orientation selectivity and <b>contrast</b> gain <b>control,</b> are suited to model the statistics of natural images. Within this model we find that <b>contrast</b> gain <b>control</b> can play a significant role for the removal of redundancies in natural images. Orientation selectivity, in contrast, has only a very limited potential for linear redundancy reduction. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Usingextracellular {{recordings}} and computational modeling, we study {{the responses of}} a population of turtle �Pseudemys scripta elegans) retinal ganglion cells to di€erent motion patterns. The onset of motion of a bright bar is signaled by a rise of the population activity that occurs within less than 100 ms. Correspondingly, more complex stimulus movement patterns are re¯ected by rapid variations of the ®ringrate of the retinal ganglion cell population. This behavior is reproduced by a computational model that generates ganglion cell activity from the spatio-temporal stimulus pattern usinga Wiener model complemented by a non-linear <b>contrast</b> gain <b>control</b> feedback loop responsible for the sharp transients in response to motion onset. This study demonstrates that <b>contrast</b> gain <b>control</b> strongly in¯uences the temporal course of retinal population activity, and thereby {{plays a major role}} in the formation of a population code for stimulus movement patterns.

50|$|Expressive {{writing is}} a form of writing therapy {{developed}} primarily by James W. Pennebaker in the late 1980s. The seminal expressive writing study instructed participants in the experimental group to write about a 'past trauma', expressing their very deepest thoughts and feelings surrounding it.

50|$|In {{cinematography}} and photography, flashing is {{the exposure}} of the film or digital sensors to uniform light prior to exposing it to the scene. It {{is used as a}} method of <b>contrast</b> <b>control</b> to bring out detail in darker areas. This adds a bias to the overall light input recorded by the sensor. When used for artistic effects, {{it can be used to}} add a colour cast to shadows without significantly affecting highlights. Flashing is usually described as a percentage of exposure increase to the film's base fog level. While the flash itself is often a neutral color temperature, the flash exposure could be any color: the color of the flash will be imbued disproportionately into the shadows of the image.|$|E
50|$|Unlike sheet film, {{in which}} each {{negative}} can be individually developed, an entire roll must be given the same development, so that N+ and N− development are normally unavailable.The key element in the scene {{is placed on the}} desired zone, {{and the rest of the}} scene falls where it will.

In most cases, he recommended N − 1 development when a single roll was to be exposed under conditions of varying contrast, so that exposure could be sufficient to give adequate shadow detail but avoid excessive density and grain build-up in the highlights.|$|E

5000|$|This is a {{technique}} for expanding the contrast of LCD-screens. LCD-screens comprise a backlight unit which is permanently emitting light and an LCD-panel {{in front of it}} which modulates transmission of light with respect to intensity and chromaticity. In order to increase the contrast of such LCD-screens the backlight can be (globally) dimmed when the image to be displayed is dark (i.e. not comprising high intensity image data) while the image data is numerically corrected and adapted to the reduced backlight intensity. In such a way the dark regions in dark images can be improved and the contrast between subsequent frames can be substantially increased. Also the contrast within one frame can be expanded intentionally depending on the histogram of the image (some sporadic highlights in an image may be cut or suppressed). There is quite some digital signal processing required for implementation of the dynamic <b>contrast</b> <b>control</b> technique {{in a way that is}} pleasing to the human visual system (e.g. no flicker effects must be induced).|$|E

40|$|The Redundancy Reduction Hypothesis by Barlow and Attneave {{suggests}} {{a link between}} the statistics of natural images and the physiologically observed structure and function in the early visual system. In particular, algorithms and probabilistic models like Independent Component Analysis, Independent Subspace Analysis and Radial Factorization, which allow for redundancy reduction mechanism, have been used successfully to generate several features of the early visual system such as bandpass filtering, <b>contrast</b> gain <b>control,</b> and orientation selective filtering when applied to natural images. Here, we propose a new family of probability distributions, called Lp-nested symmetric distributions, that comprises all of the above algorithms for natural images. This general class of distributions allows us to quantitatively asses (i) how well the assumptions made by all of the redundancy reducing models are justified for natural images, (ii) how large the contribution of each of these mechanisms (shape of filters, non-linear <b>contrast</b> gain <b>control,</b> subdivision into subspace) to redundancy reduction is. For ISA, we find that partitioning the space into different subspace only yields a competitive model when applied after <b>contrast</b> gain <b>control.</b> In this case, however, we find that the single filter responses are already almost independent. Therefore, we conclude that a partitioning into subspaces does not considerably improve the model which makes band-pass filtering (whitening) and <b>contrast</b> gain <b>control</b> (divisive normalization) the two most important mechanisms...|$|R
