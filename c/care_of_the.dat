After Elizabeth's death, the Kiev court took no interest maintaining in the church, last consecrated in 1767. Later, there were not enough funds to maintain the church, which left the maintaining of the church to private and voluntary funds, such as Andrey Muraviov.|$|E

5|$|From 1948, H.R. Holmes {{had been}} the curator but in the late 1950s had wished to {{relinquish}} the post. A replacement curator was not easily found and the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Collections was managed on a part-time basis. A security crisis in 1959 developed after {{it was discovered that}} the contents of one of the frames in the Tapling Collection was missing. In 1961 James A. Mackay was recruited as a research assistant to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Collections. In 1971 the police arrested Mackay (promoted to Assistant Keeper in 1965) and charged him with stealing items from the British Museum Philatelic Collections on loan from the Crown Agents. The stolen progressive proofs (test prints of stamp designs) should have been returned to the Crown Agents for destruction and were valued at £7,600. Mackay had exchanged the proofs for Winston Churchill stamps worth £400. He was fined £1,000 and dismissed from the Museum. As a result of the thefts, security was improved by recruiting Bob Schoolley-West, one of the investigating police officers. The Crown Agents withdrew their agreement for lending new stamps for display in the King's Library.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these offices {{there was a need}} for servants to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hunting animals. The master huntsman, or the veneur, held a central position in greater noble households. Likewise, the master falconer was a high-ranking officer, often of noble birth himself. There were spiritual needs to be cared for, and a chapel was a natural part of every large household. These household chapels would be staffed by varying numbers of clerics. The chaplains, confessors and almoners could serve in administrative capacities as well as the religious ones.|$|E

Stowe compares the dog and the people who care for such stray animals to Christian ideals to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor and suffering.|$|E
