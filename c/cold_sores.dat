5|$|Examples {{of common}} human {{diseases}} caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and <b>cold</b> <b>sores.</b> Many serious {{diseases such as}} Ebola virus disease, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is {{described in terms of}} virulence. Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.|$|E
5|$|Viruses have {{different}} {{mechanisms by which}} they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include {{the ability of the}} herpes simplex virus, which causes <b>cold</b> <b>sores,</b> to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Most people have been infected with {{at least one of these}} types of herpes virus. However, these latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis.|$|E
5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called <b>cold</b> <b>sores</b> or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E
5000|$|A lesion {{caused by}} {{recurrence}} of a latent herpes simplex infection {{can occur in}} the corner of the mouth. Really this is herpes labialis (a <b>cold</b> <b>sore),</b> and is sometimes termed [...] "angular herpes simplex". A <b>cold</b> <b>sore</b> at the corner of the mouth behaves similarly to elsewhere on the lips, and follows a pattern of vesicle (blister) formation followed by rupture leaving a crusted sore which resolves in about 7-10 days, and recurs in the same spot periodically, especially during periods of stress. Rather than utilizing antifungal creams, angular herpes simplex is treated in the same way as a <b>cold</b> <b>sore,</b> with topical antiviral drugs such as aciclovir.|$|R

25|$|One main {{motivation}} {{for the study of}} viruses is the fact that they cause many important infectious diseases, among them the common cold, influenza, rabies, measles, many forms of diarrhea, hepatitis, Dengue fever, yellow fever, polio, smallpox and AIDS. Herpes simplex causes <b>cold</b> <b>sores</b> and genital herpes and is under investigation as a possible factor in Alzheimer's.|$|E
25|$|These lesions are all Type one infections {{also known}} {{specifically}} as Herpes simplex, Herpes Zoster, and Herpes Gladiatorial are {{all types of}} herpes that are common in skin to skin contact sports. Type two herpes is known as herpes on the genitals which is spread through sexual contact. These lesions come from skin to skin contact or body secretions. The skin starts to develop blisters which can happen anywhere on the body. To return to any activity one must be cleared by a doctor. Herpes Simplex is {{the virus that causes}} <b>cold</b> <b>sores</b> this virus can be spread by oral seceretions and can also cause Herpes Gladiatorial. Once a person becomes infected the virus stays in the body forever and can reactivate itself anytime causing <b>cold</b> <b>sores.</b> Herpes Gladiatorial is a skin infection. it comes from the Herpes Simplex virus which is causes the same lesion one has when they have a cold sore. This form of herpes is on the skin and can be spread through contact with others or sharing beverages with someone who is infected or using anything that they may have contaminated. This virus remains in your system and can reactivate itself at any time causing lesions to appear. Herpes Zoster is the virus which causes shingles and chicken pox. Once one has had the chicken pox they carry the virus forever. Once one has chicken pox the virus is inactive but, if it becomes active again they get the shingles.|$|E

Some react badly to the skin test that patients must take before receiving collagen. Other patients who should not forego procedures to the lip include those who have active skin conditions like <b>cold</b> <b>sores,</b> blood clotting problems, infections, scarring of the lips or certain diseases like diabetes or lupus that cause slower healing. Patients with facial nerve disorders, severe hypertension or recurrent herpes simplex lesions should also eschew lip augmentation. As in all surgeries, smokers complicate completion of their procedure {{as well as the}} speed of healing.|$|E
40|$|See the {{editorial}} commentary by Cunningham and Booth, on pages 1645 – 7.) Background. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) infects. 70 % of the United States population. We identified a 3 -megabase region on human chromosome 21 containing 6 candidate genes associated with herpes simplex labialis (HSL, ‘‘cold sores’’). Methods. We conducted {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) scans of the chromosome 21 region to define which of 6 possible candidate genes were associated with <b>cold</b> <b>sore</b> frequency. We obtained the annual HSL frequency for 355 HSV- 1 seropositive individuals and determined the individual genotypes by SNPlex for linkage analysis and parental transmission disequilibrium testing (ParenTDT). Results. Two-point linkage analysis showed positive linkage between <b>cold</b> <b>sore</b> frequency and 2 SNPs within the C 21 orf 91 region, 1 of which is nonsynonymous. ParenTDT analysis revealed a strong association between another C 21 orf 91 SNP, predicted to lie in the 3 # untranslated region, and frequent HSL (P 5. 0047). C 21 orf 91 is a predicted open reading frame of unknown function that encodes a cytosolic protein. Conclusions. We evaluated candidate genes in the <b>cold</b> <b>sore</b> susceptibility region using fine mapping with 45 SNP markers. 2 complementary techniques identified C 21 orf 91 as a gene of interest for susceptibility to HSL. We propose that C 21 orf 91 be designated the <b>Cold</b> <b>Sore</b> Susceptibility Gene- 1 (CSSG 1) ...|$|R

25|$|A tape gag {{involves}} the use of sticky tape sealing the mouth shut. Commonly used types of tape include duct tape, gaffer tape and PVC tape from two to three inches wide. Tape gags are often the simplest of gags to apply. If the wearer blows while the tape is on it makes it easier to remove (as they can chew it off), making it not the most effective gag. To better secure the tape, a long strip of tape can be wrapped around {{the lower part of the}} person's head. A strip from ear to ear under the jaw restricts jaw movement, making the gag more effective. However, the tape can cause the skin on the lips to be ripped off and it can irritate the lips and cause fever blisters in those who have dormant fever blisters or <b>cold</b> <b>sores.</b> If left on for long, it will cause the wearer pain for the tape to be removed from their mouth. The tape can also rip hair off when wrapped around the head, despite making the gag more difficult to get off. The longer the tape is left on, the harder and more painful it is to later remove from the skin.|$|E
500|$|Common human {{diseases}} {{caused by}} viruses include the common cold, the flu, chickenpox and <b>cold</b> <b>sores.</b> Serious {{diseases such as}} Ebola and AIDS are also caused by viruses.

500|$|Herpes {{has been}} known for at least 2,000 years. Emperor Tiberius is said to have banned kissing in Rome for a time due to so many people having <b>cold</b> <b>sores.</b> In the 16th-century Romeo and Juliet, [...] {{blisters}} [...] "o'er ladies' lips" [...] are mentioned. In the 18th century, it was so common among prostitutes that it was called [...] "a vocational disease of women". The term 'herpes simplex' appeared in Richard Boulton's A System of Rational and Practical Chirurgery in 1713, where the terms 'herpes miliaris' and 'herpes exedens' also appeared. Herpes was not found to be a virus until the 1940s.|$|E

2500|$|The {{two most}} common forms of herpes {{are caused by}} {{infection}} with herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV-1 is typically acquired orally and causes <b>cold</b> <b>sores,</b> HSV-2 is usually acquired during sexual contact and affects the genitals, however either strain may affect either site. Some people are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. Those that do experience symptoms usually notice them 2 to 20 days after exposure which last 2 to 4 weeks. Symptoms can include small fluid-filled blisters, headaches, backaches, itching or tingling sensations in the genital or anal area, pain during urination, Flu like symptoms, swollen glands, or fever. Herpes is spread through skin contact with a person infected with the virus. The virus affects the areas where it entered the body. This can occur through kissing, vaginal intercourse, oral sex or anal sex. The virus is most infectious during times when there are visible symptoms, however those who are asymptomatic can still spread the virus through skin contact. The primary attack is the most severe because the body {{does not have any}} antibodies built up. After the primary attack, one might have recurring attacks that are milder or might not even have future attacks. There is no cure for the disease but there are antiviral medications that treat its symptoms and lower the risk of transmission (Valtrex). Although HSV-1 is typically the [...] "oral" [...] version of the virus, and HSV-2 is typically the [...] "genital" [...] version of the virus, a person with HSV-1 orally CAN transmit that virus to their partner genitally. The virus, either type, will settle into a nerve bundle either {{at the top of the}} spine, producing the [...] "oral" [...] outbreak, or a second nerve bundle at the base of the spine, producing the genital outbreak.|$|E
