The reversal step can also be carried out using 800 footcandle-seconds (8.6 klx·s) of light - this variation is used by process engineers to troubleshoot reversal bath chemistry problems such as contamination and issues of low tank turnover as process volumes decline.|$|E
50|$|This {{approach}} uses reversible terminator-bound dNTPs in a cyclic {{method that}} comprises nucleotide incorporation, fluorescence imaging and cleavage.A fluorescently-labeled terminator is imaged as each dNTP is added and then cleaved to allow {{incorporation of the}} next base.These nucleotides are chemically blocked such that each incorporation is a unique event. An imaging step follows each base incorporation step, then the blocked group is chemically removed to prepare each strand for the next incorporation by DNA polymerase. This series of steps continues for a specific number of cycles, as determined by user-defined instrument settings. The 3' blocking groups were originally conceived as either enzymatic or <b>chemical</b> <b>reversal</b> The chemical method has been {{the basis for the}} Solexa and Illumina machines.Sequencing by reversible terminator chemistry can be a four-colour cycle such as used by Illumina/Solexa, or a one-colour cycle such as used by Helicos BioSciences.Helicos BioSciences used “virtual Terminators”, which are unblocked terminators with a second nucleoside analogue that acts as an inhibitor. These terminators have the appropriate modifications for terminating or inhibiting groups so that DNA synthesis is terminated after a single base addition.|$|E

5000|$|Black-and-white {{reversal}} film exists but is very uncommon. Conventional black-and-white negative film can be reversal-processed to produce black-and-white slides, as by dr5 Chrome. Although kits of <b>chemicals</b> for black-and-white <b>reversal</b> processing {{may no longer}} be available to amateur darkroom enthusiasts, an acid bleaching solution, the only unusual component which is essential, is easily prepared from scratch. Black-and-white transparencies may also be produced by printing negatives onto special positive print film, still available from some specialty photographic supply dealers.|$|R
5000|$|In Ektachrome-type (E-6 process) [...] transparencies, {{the film}} is first {{processed}} in an unusual developer containing phenidone and Hydroquinone-monosulfonate. This black and white developer is used for 6:00 at 100.4°F (38°C), with more time yielding [...] "push" [...] processing to increase the apparent film speed by reducing the Dmax, or maximum density. The first developer is the most critical step in Process E-6. The solution is essentially a black-and-white film developer, because it forms only a negative silver image in each layer of the film; no dye images are yet formed. Then, the film goes directly into the first wash for 2:00 at 100 °F, which acts as a controlled stop bath. Next, the film goes into the reversal bath. This step prepares the film for the colour developer step. In this reversal bath, a <b>chemical</b> <b>reversal</b> agent is absorbed into the emulsion, with no chemical reaction taking place until the film enters the colour developer. The reversal process can also be carried out using 800 footcandle-seconds of light, which is used by process engineers to troubleshoot reversal bath chemistry problems.|$|E
40|$|Background: Protamine, an immunologically active, {{cationic}} amine, {{has been}} suspected of impairing lung mechanics when administered after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to reverse heparin. Whether such adverse changes are {{an effect of}} protamine itself, the forma-tion of heparin-protamine complexes, the extent of heparin anticoagulation, or its <b>chemical</b> <b>reversal</b> is not known. Methods and Results: Using a computer-controlled, forced-ventilation method over a vari-ety of physiological tidal volume (VT) and frequency (f) combinations, we prospectively studied 18 adult, elective patients before systemic heparinization and after protamine rever-sal to confirm and, possibly, elucidate an etiology for any adverse pulmonary effects. Prot-amine and heparin doses, their sum (&Sigma;-dose) and differential (&Delta;-dose) doses, and activated clotting times were tabulated. In all patients, lung resistance (RL) and, to a lesser extent, elastance (EL) increased after CPB, compared with pre-CPB values (P . 05) ...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{extracted}} {{with certain}} commercial brands of phenol is resistant to hydrolysis by the endonuclease DNAase I, while DNA extracted with other brands, or prepared by sodium chloride extraction, {{is susceptible to}} hydrolysis. The agent responsible for inhibition {{has been shown to}} be an oxidation product produced in some phenols. The inhibitor has been separated from other impurities in phenol by paper chromatography, and, by means of infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy, it has been identified as o-hydroxybiphenyl. The kinetics of inhibition have been studied, and it was found that inhibition arises from direct action on the DNA rather than on the enzyme. Several hydroxybiphenyls and related compounds have been tested for inhibition, and a theory of molecular structure versus inhibitory effectiveness is suggested from this data. From studies on the <b>chemical</b> <b>reversal</b> of inhibition, as well as from ultraviolet spectral studies (in both absorption and circular dichroism), it appears that the mode of action of the inhibitors is hydrogen bonding to, and intercalation between, the basis of the nucleic acid...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} chemical {{shifts and}} 2 J(PC) coupling constants in the low-temperature limiting spectra {{of a series}} of Ph(R 2 N) PCl compounds [R = Me, Et, PhCH 2, iPr and c-Hex] differ for R = primary or secondary. For primary alkyl substituents, the more downfield signal exhibits a large, positive coupling and the more upfield resonance shows a small, negative coupling. These observations are reversed for secondary alkyl substituents. Calculated minimum-energy molecular structures indicate that the source of this reversal does not lie in differences in conformation about the P [...] -N bond. Analysis of the high- and low-temperature limiting spectra {{of a series of}} Ph(RR'N) PCl compounds [R, R' = Me, Et, Bz, iPr and c-Hex] suggests that the N [...] -C carbon syn to the phosphorus lone-pair is subject to a relatively constant deshielding effect from the phosphorus-lone pair and a shielding contribution from the anti substituent that increases with increasing bulk of that anti substituent.

40|$|With the agar {{diffusion}} test and BS-C- 1 cells, mycophenolic acid {{was found to}} give a straight-line dose-response activity in inhibiting the cytopathic effects of vaccinia, herpes simplex, and measles viruses. Plaque tests have shown 100 % reduction of virus plaques by mycophenolic acid over drug ranges of 10 to 50 μg/ml and virus input as high as 6, 000 plaque-forming units (PFU) per flask. Back titration studies with measles virus inhibited by mycophenolic acid have indicated that extracellular virus titers were reduced by approximately 3 logs 10 and total virus was reduced by 1 log 10. The agar {{diffusion test}} system lends itself readily to drug reversal studies. Mycophenolic acid incorporated into agar at 10 μg/ml gave 100 % protection to virus-infected cells. Filter paper discs impregnated with selected chemical agents at concentrations of 1, 000 μg/ml (20 μg per filter paper disc) {{were placed on the}} agar surface. Reversal of the antiviral activity of mycophenolic acid was indicated by virus breakthrough in those cells in close proximity to the filter paper disc. Chemicals showing the best reversal of the antiviral activity of mycophenolic acid were guanine, guanosine, guanylic acid, deoxyguanylic acid, and 2, 6 -diaminopurine. The reversal of antiviral activity was confirmed by titrations of virus produced with various amounts of both mycophenolic acid and guanine present and by isotope tracer methods with uptakes of labeled uridine, guanine, leucine, and thymidine in treated and nontreated, infected and noninfected cells as parameters.

40|$|Statistical trend {{analysis}} {{is applied to}} a 110. years long groundwater quality time series from the national network of public supply well fields (PSWFs) in The Netherlands. Such a groundwater quality monitoring network should be available in many countries, so that approaches and experiences presented here could be of interest world wide. Trendless concentration data series measured in the early years, which should bear the least anthropogenic influences, are selected to quantify the regional natural background concentration levels (NBLs) of groundwater resources at the depth of abstraction. Trends in the period 1960 - 2005, which contained a more homogeneous data set, are normalized to drinking water standards, mapped in planar view and cross sections, and used to identify the responsible hydrochemical processes. Seven representative trend bundles are defined by aggregation of trends for individual <b>chemical</b> parameters. Trend <b>reversals</b> due to either environmental sanitation measures or well field adaptation measures are identified by comparing significant trends obtained for two different periods within the time series. Natural background levels (NBLs) for individual PSWFs are upscaled to the national groundwater body level (as reported to EU), by aggregating them according to a PSWF typology based on a Hydrochemical System Analysis. This aggregation method groups together PSWFs that deliver waters of the same origin and similar hydrogeochemical environment. PSWFs delivering old groundwaters with a very stable quality are clearly differentiated from PSWFs pumping highly vulnerable aquifers characterized by strongly deteriorating water quality trends. Results are presented on national maps of The Netherlands with NBLs and water quality trends for selected major constituents. A normalized concentration change index (NCC) is defined and mapped to relate the quality difference between a recent survey (in 2008) and calculated NBLs, to the EU drinking water standards. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract — Several {{psychiatric}} topics {{have been}} under recent investigation. Cerebral impairment is now known to occur in over half of alcoholic patients. Its improvement with abstinence and its interference with the considerable intellectual and volitional requirements needed by controlled drinking programmes point to abstinence as the necessary drinking goal when brain damage is suspected. A hereditary element to alcohol dependence has been suggested by several adoption and twin studies, but the many contradictions between research results emphasise that any genetic contribution is overshadowed by socio-cultural factors. Depression and anxiety are frequent accompaniments of alcoholism but are shown by investigations usually as results rather than causes of excessive drinking. The onset of depression with suicidal ideas secondary to alcoholism has been sensitively described, and attention drawn to its identification, potential risk, and prevention. Long-term drug treatments are little used at present, but several developments are feasible. They include an effective long-acting chemical deterrent; drugs to protect against organic damage; sobering agents; immunotherapy; <b>chemical</b> <b>reversal</b> of the neuroadaptive changes responsible for physical dependence; drugs to counteract dysphoria and craving produced by alcohol; pharmacological modification of reflex behaviour; and drugs for th...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA dynamic, process-based {{model of}} surface water acidification, MAGIC 7, {{has been applied}} to four {{representative}} alpine lakes in the Tatra Mountains (Slovakia and Poland). The model was calibrated for a set of 12 to 22 -year experimental records of lake water composition. Surface water and soil chemistry were reconstructed from 1860 to 2002 and forecast to 2050 based on the reduction in sulphur and nitrogen emissions presupposed by the Gothenburg Protocol. Relatively small changes in the soil C:N ratios were not sufficient to simulate observed changes in NO 3 ? concentrations, so an alternative empirical approach of changes in terrestrial N uptake was applied. Measured sulphate sorption isotherms did not allow calibration of the pattern of sulphate response in the lakes, indicating that other mechanisms of S release were also important. The lake water chemistry exhibited significant changes during both the acidification advance (1860 to 1980 s) and retreat (1980 s to 2010). An increase in lake water concentrations of strong acid anions (SAA; 104 ? 149 ?eq l ? 1) was balanced by a decline in HCO 3 ? (13 ? 62 ?eq l ? 1) and an increase in base cations (BC; 42 ? 72 ?eq l ? 1), H + (0 - 18 ?eq l ? 1), and Al i n+ (0 ? 26 ?eq l ? 1). The carbonate buffering system was depleted in three lakes. In contrast, lake water concentrations of SAA, BC, H +, and Al i n+ decreased by 57 ? 82, 28 ? 42, 0 ? 11, and 0 ? 22 ?eq l ? 1, respectively, the carbonate buffering system was re-established, and HCO 3 ? increased by 1 ? 21 ?eq l ? 1 during the <b>chemical</b> <b>reversal</b> from atmospheric acidification (by 2000). The MAGIC 7 model forecasts a slight continuation in this reversal for the next decade and new steady-state conditions thereafter. Gran alkalinity should come back to 1950 s levels (0 ? 71 ?eq l ? 1) in all lakes after 2010. Partial recovery of the soil pool of exchangeable base cations can be expected in one catchment, while only conservation of the current conditions is predicted for three lakes. Even though the pre-industrial alkalinity values of 16 ? 80 ?eq l ? 1 will not be reached due to the insufficient recovery of soil quality, the ongoing chemical improvement of water should be sufficient for biological recovery of most alpine lakes in the Tatra Mountains.
