After the chorus, she appears in a newsroom. Reporters take photographs of her while she sprawls across a desk wearing a pink latex dress. Scenes of Rihanna and others in bondage gear are interspersed with images of the singer wearing a feather boa and a tube top with [...] "censored" [...] printed across it. The video then alternates between previous scenes and images in which Rihanna eats bananas, strawberries and cream, and jewel-covered ice cream.

5000|$|Proponents of CCTV cameras {{argue that}} cameras are {{effective}} at deterring and solving crime, and that appropriate regulation and legal restrictions on surveillance of public spaces can provide sufficient protections so that an individual's {{right to privacy}} can reasonably be weighed against the benefits of surveillance. However, anti-surveillance activists have held {{that there is a}} right to privacy in public areas. Furthermore, {{while it is true that}} there may be scenarios wherein a person's right to public privacy can be both reasonably and justifiably compromised, some scholars have argued that such situations are so rare as to not sufficiently warrant the frequent compromising of public privacy rights that occurs in regions with widespread <b>CCTV</b> <b>surveillance.</b> For example, in her book Setting the Watch: Privacy and the Ethics of <b>CCTV</b> <b>Surveillance,</b> Beatrice von Silva-Tarouca Larsen argues that <b>CCTV</b> <b>surveillance</b> is ethically permissible only in [...] "certain restrictively defined situations", such as when a specific location has a [...] "comprehensively documented and significant criminal threat". Her central reasoning is that widespread <b>CCTV</b> <b>surveillance</b> violates citizens' rights to privacy and anonymity within the public sphere by jeopardizing both their liberty and dignity. She concludes that <b>CCTV</b> <b>surveillance</b> should therefore be reserved for specific circumstances in which there are clear and reasonably demonstrated benefits to its implementation and few ethical compromises.|$|E
