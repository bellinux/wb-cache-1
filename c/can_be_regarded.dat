5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E
5|$|Communities {{have formed}} around the creation, play and {{discussion}} of LARP. These communities have developed a subculture that crosses over with role-playing, fan, reenactment, and drama subcultures. Early LARP subculture focused on Tolkien-like fantasy, but it later broadened to include appreciation of other genres, especially the horror genre with the rapid uptake of the World of Darkness setting in the 1990s. Like many subcultures, LARP groups often have a common context of shared experience, language, humour, and clothing that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> {{by some as a}} lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|Having honed his {{personal}} style {{as a young}} man, and sticking broadly with {{it for the rest}} of his career, Massenet does not, as some other composers do, lend himself to classification into clearly defined early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his versatility means that there is no plot or locale that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as typical Massenet. Another respect in which he differed from many opera composers is that he did not work regularly with the same librettists: Grove lists more than thirty writers who provided him with librettos.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{resonators}} in the expression {{corresponds to the}} number of passbands required. Lowpass and highpass filters can be viewed as special cases of the resonator expression with {{one or the other of}} the terms becoming zero as appropriate. Bandstop filters <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as a combination of a lowpass and a highpass filter. Multiple bandstop filters can always be expressed in terms of a multiple bandpass filter. In this way it, can be seen that this transformation represents the general case for any bandform, and all the other transformations are to be viewed as special cases of it.|$|E

5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E
5|$|Human {{attitudes toward}} insects are often negative, {{reinforced}} by sensationalism in the media. This {{has produced a}} society that attempts to eliminate insects from daily life. For example, nearly 75 million pounds of broad-spectrum insecticides are manufactured and sold each year for use in American homes and gardens. Annual revenues from insecticide sales to homeowners exceeded $450 million in 2004. Out of the roughly a million species of insects described so far, not more than 1,000 <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as serious pests, and less than 10,000 (about 1%) are even occasional pests. Yet not one species of insect has been permanently eradicated {{through the use of}} pesticides. Instead, at least 1,000 species have developed field resistance to pesticides, and extensive harm has been done to beneficial insects including pollinators such as bees.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the other}} kings of the Fifth Dynasty, Shepseskare's name appears neither in the {{personal}} names of people of the time nor {{in the names of}} funerary estates. He is also absent from the titles and biographies of state officials. For example, the stela of the Fifth Dynasty official Khau-Ptah lists an uninterrupted sequence of kings whom he served under, namely Sahure, Neferirkare, Neferefre and Nyuserre. The omission of Shepseskare, be it between Neferirkare and Neferefre or between Neferefre and Nyuserre, indicates that his reign must have been very short. Since Manetho's Aegyptiaca dates to the 3rd century BC, Khau-Ptah's contemporary account <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as a more accurate indication of the political situation during the Fifth Dynasty.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the authors}} of the 2011 genetic study, the close {{relation}} between the King Island and mainland emus indicates that the former population was isolated from the latter relatively recently, due to sea level changes in the Bass Strait, as opposed to a founding emu lineage that diverged from the mainland emu far earlier and had subsequently gone extinct on the mainland. Models of sea level change indicate that Tasmania, including King Island, was isolated from the Australian mainland around 14,000 years ago. Up to several thousand years later King Island was then separated from Tasmania. This scenario would suggest that a population ancestral to both the King Island and Tasmanian emu was initially isolated from the mainland taxon, after which the King Island and Tasmanian populations were separated. This in turn indicates that the likewise extinct Tasmanian emu is probably as closely related to the mainland emu as is the King Island emu, with both the King Island and Tasmanian emu being more closely related to each other. Fossil emu taxa show an average size between that of the King Island emu and mainland emu. Hence, mainland emus <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as a large or gigantic form.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the dyke suggests that it was built to create an effective barrier and to command views into Wales. This implies that the Mercians who built it were free to choose the best location for the dyke. There are settlements {{to the west of}} the dyke that have names that imply they were English by the 8th century, so it may be that in choosing the location of the barrier the Mercians were consciously surrendering some territory to the native Britons. Alternatively it may be that these settlements had already been retaken by the Welsh, implying a defensive role for the barrier. The effort and expense that must have gone into building the dyke are impressive, and suggest that the king who had it built (whether Offa or someone else) had considerable resources at his disposal. Other substantial construction projects of a similar date do exist, however, such as Wat's Dyke and Danevirke, in what is now Germany as well as such sites as Stonehenge from millennia earlier. The dyke <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> in the light of these counterparts as the largest and most recent great {{construction of}} the preliterate inhabitants of Britain.|$|E
5|$|The many {{different}} forms of periodic table have prompted {{the question of whether}} there is an optimal or definitive form of periodic table. The answer to this question is thought to depend on whether the chemical periodicity seen to occur among the elements has an underlying truth, effectively hard-wired into the universe, or if any such periodicity is instead the product of subjective human interpretation, contingent upon the circumstances, beliefs and predilections of human observers. An objective basis for chemical periodicity would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium, and the composition of group 3. Such an underlying truth, if it exists, is thought to have not yet been discovered. In its absence, the {{many different}} forms of periodic table <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as variations on the theme of chemical periodicity, each of which explores and emphasizes different aspects, properties, perspectives and relationships of and among the elements.|$|E

5|$|The victory {{claims that}} were made by each side in the {{immediate}} aftermath of the Battle of Hampton Roads, based as both were on misinterpretations of the opponent's behavior, have been dismissed by present-day historians. They agree that the result of the Monitor–Merrimack encounter was not a victory for either side. As the combat between ironclads was the primary significance of the battle, the general verdict is that the overall result was a draw. All would acknowledge that the Southern fleet inflicted far more damage than it received, which would ordinarily imply that they had gained a tactical victory. Compared to other Civil War battles, the loss of men and ships for the Union Navy would be considered a clear defeat. On the other hand, the blockade was not seriously threatened, so the entire battle <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as an assault that ultimately failed.|$|E
