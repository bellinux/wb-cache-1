40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a series of <b>cookbooks</b> {{published}} by Indigenous Australian groups. These <b>cookbooks</b> are typically produced with government funding, and are developed by nutritionists, dieticians, and health workers in consultation with local communities. They are designed to teach Indigenous Australians to cook healthy, nutritious, low-cost meals. In this paper, Fredericks and Anderson identify the value of these <b>cookbooks</b> as low-cost, public health interventions. However, they note that their value as health interventions has not been tested. Fredericks and Anderson question the value of these <b>cookbooks</b> within the broader context of the health disadvantage faced by Indigenous Australians. They argue that the <b>cookbooks</b> are developed from a Western perspective of health and nutrition that fails to recognise the value of traditional Indigenous foodways. They suggest that incorporating more Indigenous food knowledge and food-related traditions into <b>cookbooks</b> may be one way of improving health among Indigenous peoples and revitalising Indigenous knowledge...|$|R

This essay seeks to address this oversight, setting out to explore the potential contribution of a turn to <b>cookbooks</b> for enriching {{our understanding of the}} character of contemporary consumer culture. It weaves a line of argument that asserts the value of treating <b>cookbooks</b> as cultural products, as objectifications of culinary culture, as constructed social forms which are amenable to textual analysis. In this respect it declares that, rather than simply being understood as reflections of contemporary consumer culture, <b>cookbooks</b> should be understood as artefacts of cultural life in the making. That is, <b>cookbooks</b> contain not only recipes but inscribed cultural tales which can be understood as productive of the culinary culture that they pretend only to display, and performative in their attempt to do things with us.

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{produces an}} extensive and intensive {{study of the}} culture of food in postcolonial literature and <b>cookbooks</b> that describe particular regions and cultures. My interrogation treats novels and <b>cookbooks</b> that depict food and eating in Africa, South Asia, and the Caribbean to argue that while both <b>cookbooks</b> and novels depict as unstable the connection between food and culture; the key difference lies {{in the manner in which}} each genre describes that instability. My dissertation uses memoir <b>cookbooks</b> (<b>cookbooks</b> that use the autobiographical accounts of their authors as a method of organizing content and providing context for recipes) and literary depictions of cooking and eating to trouble the neat tautology that establishes food and home as interchangeable cultural signifiers of equal weight. I evaluate the work that <b>cookbooks</b> do by comparing them to representations of cooking, eating and food in representative novels that frame depictions of citizenship and the nation in deeply ambivalent terms even as they depict delicious meals, well-laid family tables, and clean, productive kitchens. I use both <b>cookbooks</b> and novels to illustrate how the text under consideration in my dissertation act out the concerns that structure postcolonial critique. If regional <b>cookbooks</b> provide obscured or incomplete insight into the cultures they purport to authentically depict, then the novels I study provide openly ambivalent accounts of cultural identification. My dissertation begins by examining how pan-cultural <b>cookbooks</b> do the work of drawing multiple nations beneath the aegis of the global [...] and how this work fails to engage the problematic cosmopolitics of globality as revealed in two South Asian novels. I then examine African texts to analyze the difficulties that press bodies into motion [...] hunger and impoverishment, political disenfranchisement and oppression, and attenuated relationships with cultural traditions. The dissertation then moves to America via the Caribbean, examining diasporic longing in Cuban expatriates and the manner in which regional <b>cookbooks</b> and memoirs construct the past by reinventing the spaces that their authors have left behind...|$|R
