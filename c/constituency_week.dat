(Tan Lam Siong served in the post for only five months. His predecessor, Jeannette Chong-Aruldoss, had replaced Poa in October 2013 after Poa stepped down.) However, in August 2015, Pao announced that she was stepping down as Acting Secretary-General and leaving the party because she disgareed with the decision of the party's Central Executive Committee to field a candidate in the single-member constituency of MacPherson in the 2015 general election even though the Workers' Party was also planning to contest the PAP in the <b>constituency.</b> A <b>week</b> later, Poa was seen helping out with Singapore Democratic Party team in their walkabout at Bukit Timah Market and Food Centre on August 30.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "black man" [...] was Dadabhai Naoroji, an Indian. Salisbury's {{comments}} were criticised by the Queen and by Liberals {{who believed that}} Salisbury had suggested that only white Britons could represent a British <b>constituency.</b> Three <b>weeks</b> later, Salisbury delivered a speech at Scarborough, where he denied that [...] "the word [...] "black" [...] necessarily implies any contemptuous denunciation: [...] "Such a doctrine {{seems to be a}} scathing insult to a very large proportion of the human race... The people whom we have been fighting at Suakim, and whom we have happily conquered, are among the finest tribes in the world, {{and many of them are}} as black as my hat". Furthermore, [...] "such candidatures are incongruous and unwise. The British House of Commons, with its traditions... is a machine too peculiar and too delicate to be managed by any but those who have been born within these isles". Naoroji was elected for Finsbury in 1892 and Salisbury invited him to become a Governor of the Imperial Institute, which he accepted.|$|R
