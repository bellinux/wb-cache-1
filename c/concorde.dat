5|$|<b>Concorde</b> also {{acquired}} an unusual nomenclature for an aircraft. In common usage in the United Kingdom, the type {{is known as}} <b>Concorde</b> without an article, rather than the <b>Concorde</b> or a <b>Concorde.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>Concorde</b> was not withdrawn for the reasons usually given but that it became apparent during the grounding of <b>Concorde</b> that the airlines could make more profit carrying first-class passengers subsonically. A lack of commitment to <b>Concorde</b> from Director of Engineering Alan MacDonald was cited as having undermined BA's resolve to continue operating <b>Concorde.</b>|$|E
5|$|Filton {{played a}} key role in the Anglo-French <b>Concorde</b> {{supersonic}} airliner project during the 1960s. The British <b>Concorde</b> prototype made its maiden flight from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969, five weeks after the French test flight. In 2003 British Airways and Air France decided to discontinue <b>Concorde</b> flights, retiring the aircraft to locations (primarily museums) worldwide. On 26 November 2003 <b>Concorde</b> 216 made the final <b>Concorde</b> flight, returning to Bristol Filton Airport as the centrepiece of a proposed air museum which is planned to include the existing Bristol Aero collection (including a Bristol Britannia).|$|E

He was released by the <b>Concordes</b> in September 1983 after quarterback Johnny Evans, who was injured before the season began, returned.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the launch}} of British Airways <b>Concorde</b> services, Britain's other major airline, British Caledonian (BCal), set up a task force headed by Gordon Davidson, BA's former <b>Concorde</b> director, to {{investigate}} the possibility of their own <b>Concorde</b> operations. This was seen as particularly viable for the airline's long-haul network as there were two unsold aircraft then available for purchase.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} reason for BCal's interest in <b>Concorde</b> was that the British Government's 1976 aviation policy review had opened the possibility of BA setting up supersonic services in competition with BCal's established sphere of influence. To counteract this potential threat, BCal considered their own independent <b>Concorde</b> plans, {{as well as a}} partnership with BA. BCal were considered most likely to have set up a <b>Concorde</b> service on the Gatwick–Lagos route, a major source of revenue and profits within BCal's scheduled route network; BCal's <b>Concorde</b> task force did assess the viability of a daily supersonic service complementing the existing subsonic widebody service on this route.|$|E

5|$|The United States {{cancelled}} the Boeing 2707, its rival {{supersonic transport}} programme, in 1971. Observers {{have suggested that}} opposition to <b>Concorde</b> on grounds of noise pollution had been encouraged by the United States Government, as it lacked its own competitor. The US, India, and Malaysia all ruled out <b>Concorde</b> supersonic flights over the noise concern, although some of these restrictions were later relaxed. Professor Douglas Ross characterised restrictions placed upon <b>Concorde</b> operations by President Jimmy Carter's administration as having been an act of protectionism of American aircraft manufacturers. <b>Concorde</b> flew to an altitude of 68,000ft (20,700m) during a test flight in June 1973.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads of}} France and the United Kingdom flew <b>Concorde</b> many times. Presidents Georges Pompidou, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and François Mitterrand {{regularly}} used <b>Concorde</b> as French flagman aircraft in foreign visits. Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Ministers Edward Heath, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair took <b>Concorde</b> in some charter flights {{such as the}} Queen's trips to Barbados on her Silver Jubilee in 1977, in 1987 and in 2003, to Middle East in 1984 and to the United States in 1991., museum Pope John Paul II flew on <b>Concorde</b> in May 1989.|$|E

Jock Lowe, ex-chief <b>Concorde</b> pilot {{and manager of}} the fleet estimated in 2004 that it would cost £10–15million to make G-BOAF airworthy again. BA maintain ownership and have stated {{that they will not}} fly again {{due to a lack of}} support from Airbus. On 1 December 2003, Bonhams held an auction of British Airways <b>Concorde</b> artefacts, including a nose cone, at Kensington Olympia in London. Proceeds of around £750,000 were raised, with the majority going to charity. G-BOAD is currently on display at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. In 2007, BA announced that the advertising spot at Heathrow where a 40% scale model of <b>Concorde</b> was located would not be retained; the model is now on display at the Brooklands Museum, in Surrey, England.|$|E
5|$|Between 1984 and 1991, British Airways flew a thrice-weekly <b>Concorde</b> service between London and Miami, {{stopping}} at Washington Dulles International Airport.

5|$|British Airways and Air France {{operated}} the supersonic airliner Aerospatiale-BAC <b>Concorde,</b> and the world's first supersonic passenger service flew in January 1976 from London Heathrow to Bahrain. Services to the US began on 24 May 1976 with {{a flight to}} Washington Dulles airport, and flights to New York JFK airport followed on 22 September 1977. Service to Singapore was established in co-operation with Singapore Airlines as {{a continuation of the}} flight to Bahrain. Following the Air France <b>Concorde</b> crash in Paris and a slump in air travel following the 11 September attacks in New York in 2001, it was decided to cease <b>Concorde</b> operations in 2003 after 27 years of service. The final commercial <b>Concorde</b> flight was BA002 from New York JFK to London Heathrow on 24 October 2003.|$|E
5|$|British Airways retired its <b>Concorde</b> fleet on 24 October 2003. G-BOAG left New York to a fanfare {{similar to}} that given for Air France's F-BTSD, while two more made round trips, G-BOAF over the Bay of Biscay, {{carrying}} VIP guests including former <b>Concorde</b> pilots, and G-BOAE to Edinburgh. The three aircraft then circled over London, having received special permission to fly at low altitude, before landing in sequence at Heathrow. The captain of the New York to London flight was Mike Bannister. The final flight of a <b>Concorde</b> in the US occurred on 5 November 2003 when G-BOAG flew from New York's JFK Airport to Seattle's Boeing Field to join the Museum of Flight's permanent collection. The plane was piloted by Mike Bannister and Les Broadie, who claimed a flight time of three hours, 55 minutes and 12 seconds, a record between the two cities. The museum had been pursuing a <b>Concorde</b> for their collection since 1984. The final flight of a <b>Concorde</b> worldwide took place on 26 November 2003 with a landing at Filton, Bristol, UK.|$|E

50|$|Tousignant's only {{professional}} {{season was}} the 1982 CFL {{season with the}} Montreal <b>Concordes</b> (which {{is part of the}} Montreal Alouettes franchise history.) He played in all of their 16 games, starting 5 times. He completed only 75 of his 174 passes, for 989 yards, 4 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. The <b>Concordes</b> finished the year 2-14.|$|R
5|$|<b>Concorde</b> is an {{ogival delta}} winged {{aircraft}} with four Olympus engines {{based on those}} employed in the RAF's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber. It {{is one of the}} few commercial aircraft to employ a tailless design (the Tupolev Tu-144 being another). <b>Concorde</b> was the first airliner to have a (in this case, analogue) fly-by-wire flight-control system; the avionics system <b>Concorde</b> used was unique because it was the first commercial aircraft to employ hybrid circuits. The principal designer for the project was Pierre Satre, with Sir Archibald Russell as his deputy.|$|E
5|$|Construction of two prototypes {{began in}} February 1965: 001, built by Aérospatiale at Toulouse, and 002, by BAC at Filton, Bristol. <b>Concorde</b> 001 {{made its first}} test flight from Toulouse on 2 March 1969, piloted by André Turcat, and first went {{supersonic}} on 1 October. The first UK-built <b>Concorde</b> flew from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969, piloted by Brian Trubshaw. Both prototypes were presented {{to the public for}} the first time on 7–8 June 1969 at the Paris Air Show. As the flight programme progressed, 001 embarked on a sales and demonstration tour on 4 September 1971, which was also the first transatlantic crossing of <b>Concorde.</b> <b>Concorde</b> 002 followed suit on 2 June 1972 with a tour of the Middle and Far East. <b>Concorde</b> 002 made the first visit to the United States in 1973, landing at the new Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Airport to mark that airport's opening.|$|E
5|$|Engine failure causes {{problems}} on conventional subsonic aircraft; {{not only does}} the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank {{in the direction of the}} failed engine. If this had happened to <b>Concorde</b> at supersonic speeds, it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic failure of the airframe. Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems, in practice <b>Concorde</b> could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without the predicted difficulties. During an engine failure the required air intake is virtually zero. So, on <b>Concorde,</b> engine failure was countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards past the engine, gaining lift and minimising drag. <b>Concorde</b> pilots were routinely trained to handle double engine failure.|$|E
