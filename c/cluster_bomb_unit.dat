50|$|Some {{aircraft}} types {{can carry}} {{a wide variety of}} ordnance - for example the Fairchild AU-23 Peacemaker could use forward-firing gun pods, 500 and 250 pound <b>bombs,</b> napalm <b>units,</b> <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>units,</b> flares, rockets, smoke grenades and propaganda leaflet dispensers.|$|R
25|$|The Elwood {{unit was}} reopened in 1966 and would produce {{artillery}} rounds, supplementary charge assemblies and <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>units.</b> The Kankakee unit was reopened in 1965 and would manufacture TNT until 1976. During the Vietnam War the Joliet Arsenal was renamed Joliet Army Ammunition Plant. The majority of {{operations at the}} facility were terminated by the late 1970s.|$|R
50|$|The mines were {{typically}} deployed from SUU-41A/A and SUU-41B/A dispensers, with the dispensers packed into <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>units</b> with between 12 and 16 dispensers in each <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb.</b> A single bomb could contain between 1,470 and 7,500 mines. The bombs could be dropped from aircraft at between 60 and 6000 meters and at speeds of 370 km/h to 1300 km/h. The dispensers would burst {{at an altitude}} of between 200 to 300 meters, scattering the mines.|$|R
50|$|Weapons {{used on the}} F-4F {{included}} the Mk 82 retarded bomb, BL755 <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>unit</b> and AIM-9 Sidewinders. Later on, an AGM-65 Maverick capability was added, {{with a pair of}} missiles housed in a single launcher.|$|E
50|$|The CBU-97 Sensor Fuzed Weapon is a United States Air Force 1000 lb-class non-guided (freefall) <b>Cluster</b> <b>Bomb</b> <b>Unit</b> (CBU). It was {{developed}} and produced by Textron Defense Systems. The CBU-97 {{in conjunction with the}} Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser guidance tail kit, which converts it to a precision-guided weapon, is designated CBU-105.|$|E
50|$|The CBU-87 Combined Effects Munition is {{a cluster}} bomb {{used by the}} United States Air Force, {{developed}} by Aerojet General/Honeywell and introduced in 1986 to replace the earlier cluster bombs used in the Vietnam War. CBU stands for <b>Cluster</b> <b>Bomb</b> <b>Unit.</b> When the CBU-87 is {{used in conjunction with}} the Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser guidance tail kit, it becomes a precision-guided weapon, and is designated CBU-103.|$|E
50|$|By 04:50 flares and tank {{searchlights}} detected {{that the}} Viet Cong were massing {{for an attack}} on the south and southeastern sides of the base. The Viet Cong started their attack ten minutes later, and they were met with artillery fire, <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>units,</b> napalm and 500 pound bombs. This last wave of firepower ended the offensive. At 07:00 the final air strike and artillery rounds were fired.|$|R
50|$|In December 1968, the RO took {{a survey}} of the {{administration}} and supply of the Royal Lao Air Force. They discovered no accounting for materiel; the Lao logistics system was plagued by theft, erratic distribution of goods, and overstocking on some items. To counter these problems, the RO instituted a troop welfare program for the RLAF financed by sale of such leavings as cartridge cases, scrap lumber, and used <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
500|$|The B-1 {{has been}} {{upgraded}} since production, {{beginning with the}} [...] "Conventional Mission Upgrade Program" [...] (CMUP), which added a new MIL-STD-1760 smart-weapons interface to enable the use of precision-guided conventional weapons. CMUP began with Block A, which was the standard B-1B with the capability to deliver non-precision gravity bombs. Block B brought an improved Synthetic Aperture Radar, and upgrades to the Defensive Countermeasures System and was fielded in 1995. Block C provided an [...] "enhanced capability" [...] for delivery of up to 30 <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>units</b> (CBUs) per sortie with modifications made to 50 bomb racks.|$|R
50|$|In {{the strike}} role the FGR.2s could carry the SNEB rocket pod, 1,000 lb (454 kg) bomb, the BL755 <b>Cluster</b> <b>Bomb</b> <b>Unit,</b> and U.S.-supplied B28, B43, B57 or B61 nuclear weapons. It {{could also be}} fitted with SUU-16/A and SUU-23/A gun pods. From 1975 the {{aircraft}} were modified with structural reinforcements and tail-mounted radar warning receivers. When the aircraft took over the air-defence duties in the 1970s they carried either AIM-9G Sidewinders or AIM-7 Sparrows, and later they would carry the then new British Aerospace Skyflash missile and the updated AIM-9L Sidewinder. In the 1980s, the Tornado started to replace the Phantom in the air-defence role.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} the Americans felt that they were better {{prepared}} to deliver destruction to the trail system. During Commando Hunt III (1 November 1969 to 30 April 1970), the Air Force claimed that 6,428 enemy trucks destroyed and another 3,604 damaged. 60 aircraft were shot down during this phase of the campaign by an estimated 743 anti-aircraft weapons. This increased number of aircraft losses forced the Air Force to decree that flak suppression missions would accompany the bombers on missions over the trail. Armed with <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>units</b> (CBUs), the fighter bombers were poised to pounce upon any enemy anti-aircraft positions identified by other aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The 169th Fighter Wing, South Carolina Air National Guard, was {{the first}} ANG fighter unit to deploy to Southwest Asia in direct support of the air war over Afghanistan. It sent over 200 {{personnel}} and six F-16CJs in January 2002 to Al Udeid Air Base in Doha, Qatar, to assist air combat operations over Afghanistan. In particular, they provided Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) against Taliban and al Qaeda positions, the only Air Force fighter unit in the theater to do so. F-16s sometimes were also configured for <b>Cluster</b> <b>Bomb</b> <b>Units</b> (CBUw). In addition, F-16 pilots sometimes fired their 20mm gun against ground targets. Missions could last up to 10 hours with multiple air refuelings. After so many hours strapped in their seats, pilots generally received one to three days of crew rest. The unit returned to South Carolina on 3 April 2002.|$|R
50|$|In May 1971 the Aeronautical Systems Division at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, {{began work}} on a project to {{evaluate}} the potential use of armed light utility short takeoff and landing aircraft in Southeast Asia. The program, named Credible Chase, was designed to add mobility and firepower to the South Vietnamese Air Forces {{in a relatively short}} time. Two commercial aircraft were selected for testing: the Fairchild Porter and the Helio Stallion. Initial performance testing was conducted with leased aircraft at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and was successful enough to warrant a combat evaluation. The Porter, designated AU-23A, was fitted with a side-firing 20mm XM-197 Gatling cannon, four wing pylons and a center fuselage station for external ordnance. The 20mm cannon was essentially a three-barrel version of the M61 Vulcan 6-barrel 20mm cannon. The aircraft could carry a variety of ordnance including forward-firing gun pods, 500 and 250 pound <b>bombs,</b> napalm <b>units,</b> <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>units,</b> flares, rockets, smoke grenades and Airborne leaflet propaganda dispensers.|$|R

50|$|The combat evaluation, PAVE COIN, {{was done}} in June and July 1971. The AU-23A was tested for eight {{possible}} missions: armed escort of helicopters, close air support, hamlet defense, STOL airlift and resupply, armed reconnaissance, border surveillance, forward air control, and counter infiltration. USAF crews flew 73 missions (94 sorties) and RVNAF crews flew 68 missions (85 sorties). Several types of weapons were test dropped/fired including 2.75-inch rockets (explosive and smoke), <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>units</b> (CBU-14), MK 6 Mod 3 flares, and MK 81, 82 and 106 practice bombs. More than 8,000 rounds of 20mm ammunition was fired also—both high explosive incendiary and target practice tracer types. Several problems were discovered during the PAVE COIN program, the most serious was the extreme vulnerability of the aircraft to all but the lightest antiaircraft fire (below 12.7mm). Despite the problems, the USAF continued with the development program and ordered 15 AU-23As for further testing.|$|R

25|$|The CIA {{paramilitary}} {{agents in}} MR 3 were {{unique in the}} Laotian Civil War in the direct control {{they were allowed to}} exert on their irregular operations. In early 1969, MR 3 hosted three Royalist guerrilla battalions newly trained by the CIA at its Savannakhet base. On 23 March, two of Red Battalion's companies, with 115 men apiece, were tasked with the Operation Duck raid on an enemy complex housed in a cave southeast of Mahaxay. The purpose of the raid was to destroy the complex while gathering enemy documents for military intelligence analysis. Helilifted in by the 20th Special Operations Squadron (20th SOS) and Air America under air cover of U.S. Air Force (USAF) tactical fighter strikes, the guerrillas were heavily engaged by the PAVN. Four times the communist headquarters was struck by U.S. Air Force jets depositing napalm, <b>cluster</b> <b>bomb</b> <b>units,</b> and 2,000 pound bombs. After suffering four killed, and having killed 40 of their foe, the raiders noted an incoming thunderstorm that would halt air strikes and fled southwards. On 26 March, eight CH-3E helicopters of the 20th SOS began evacuating the Red Battalion troops. They removed 70, but received battle damage from heavy ground fire to five helicopters, and aborted the mission. The remaining Royalist troops evaded the communists and moved to Route 122 to be removed on 27 March. Despite these disappointing results, the new guerrilla force was deemed ready for further action.|$|R
2500|$|Beginning in 1965, Project Black Spot was a {{test program}} {{designed}} to give the Air Force a self-contained night attack capability to seek out and destroy targets along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. After the program {{was approved by the}} Department of Defense in early 1966, E-Systems of Greenville, Texas modified two C-123K Providers which were redesignated NC-123Ks, but were often referred to as AC-123Ks. The aircraft were equipped with a long, 57.75inch nose fairing that housed an X-band forward-looking radar. Below and aft of the extended radome was a turret with Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR), Low-Level Light Television (LLLTV), and a laser range-finder/illuminator. Also, a low-level Doppler navigation radar and weapons release computer were installed. Two rectangular aluminum weapons dispensers (for CBU bomblets) were stacked within the fuselage. Each container housed 12 cells, each cell containing three <b>Cluster</b> <b>Bomb</b> <b>Units</b> (CBUs). Depending on the type of CBU installed, the containers had a capacity of between 2,664 and 6,372 one pound bomblets. The bomblets were released through 12 openings in the cargo floor that aligned with the cells in the weapons dispenser. The lower fuselage contained 12 inward opening doors that aligned with the openings in the cargo floor, forming a chute. Bomblet release was controlled by a weapons panel in the forward section of the fuselage. In the event of an emergency, the entire load could be jettisoned manually. The first aircraft, 54–691, was delivered to Eglin AFB in August 1967 and the second, 54–698, incorporating an AN/ASD-5 Black Crow direction finder set (engine ignition sensor), was delivered in February 1968. The two aircraft were then deployed, first the Republic of Korea, to be evaluated against North Korean high-speed patrol boats used to insert agents, 19 August – 23 October 1968; and then to South Vietnam with operations beginning 15 November 1968. Despite their success, with 70% of all missions completed and in-commission rate of 84%, there were no follow-on NC-123Ks modified. [...] The two aircraft were transferred to the 16th Special Operations Squadron at Udon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, where they continued to serve from late 1969 to June 1970. Both airframes were then returned to standard C-123K configuration to serve again as airlifters.|$|R
