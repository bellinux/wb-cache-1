5|$|Bats are placental mammals. They were {{formerly}} grouped in the superorder Archonta, {{along with}} the treeshrews (Scandentia), colugos (Dermoptera), and the primates, because of the apparent similarities between Megachiroptera and such mammals. Genetic evidence places bats in the superorder Laurasiatheria, with its sister taxon as Fereuungulata, which includes carnivorans, pangolins, odd-toed ungulates, even-toed ungulates, and cetaceans. One study places <b>Chiroptera</b> as a sister taxon to odd-toed ungulates (Perissodactyla).|$|E
5|$|Current {{research}} indicates that mammals did not explosively diversify across the K–Pg boundary, despite the environment niches made available by the extinction of dinosaurs. Several mammalian orders have been interpreted as diversifying immediately after the K–Pg boundary, including <b>Chiroptera</b> (bats) and Cetartiodactyla (a diverse group that today includes whales and dolphins and even-toed ungulates), although recent research concludes that only marsupial orders diversified after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Chiroptera</b> {{as a whole}} are in {{the process}} of losing the ability to {{synthesize}} vitamin C: most have lost it completely. In a test of 34 bat species from six major families of bats, including major insect- and fruit-eating bat families, all were found to have lost the ability to synthesize it, and this loss may derive from a common bat ancestor, as a single mutation. Earlier reports of only fruit bats being deficient were based on smaller samples. However, recent results show that there are at least two species of bat, the frugivorous bat (Rousettus leschenaultii) and insectivorous bat (Hipposideros armiger), that have retained their ability to produce vitamin C.|$|E
25|$|Megabats make up {{the only}} family (Pteropodidae) in order <b>Chiroptera</b> that is not capable of {{laryngeal}} echolocation. Echolocation and flight evolved early in the lineage of chiropterans. Although echolocation was later lost in family Pteropodidae, bats in the genus Rousettus are capable of primitive echolocation through clicking their tongue, and some species {{have been shown to}} create clicks similar to those of echolocating bats using their wings.|$|E
25|$|Most tested {{families}} of bats (Order <b>Chiroptera),</b> including major insect and fruit-eating bat families, cannot synthesize vitamin C. A trace of gulonolactone oxidase (GULO) was detected in only 1 of 34 bat species tested, across {{the range of}} 6 {{families of}} bats tested. There {{are at least two}} species of bats, frugivorous bat (Rousettus leschenaultii) and insectivorous bat (Hipposideros armiger), that retain (or regained) their ability of vitamin C production.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s {{understanding}} of the relationships among eutherian mammals has experienced a virtual revolution. Molecular phylogenomics, new fossil finds and innovative morphological interpretations now group the more than 4600 extant species of eutherians into four major super-ordinal clades: Euarchontoglires (including Primates, Dermoptera, Scandentia, Rodentia, and Lagomorpha), Laurasiatheria (Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Carnivora, <b>Chiroptera,</b> Pholidota, and Eulipotyphla), Xenarthra, and Afrotheria (Proboscidea, Sirenia, Hyracoidea, Afrosoricida, Tubulidentata, and Macroscelidea). This tree is very useful in unifying the parts of a puzzle in comparative mammalian cytogenetics.|$|E
25|$|However, {{other views}} have been shared, and a {{vigorous}} debate persists to this date. For example, in the 1980s and 1990s, some researchers proposed (based {{primarily on the}} similarity of the visual pathways) that the Megachiroptera were in fact more closely affiliated with the primates than the Microchiroptera, with {{the two groups of}} bats having therefore evolved flight via convergence (see Flying primates theory). However, a recent flurry of genetic studies confirms the more longstanding notion that all bats are indeed members of the same clade, the <b>Chiroptera.</b> Other studies have recently suggested that certain families of microbats (possibly the horseshoe bats, mouse-tailed bats, and the false vampires) are evolutionarily closer to the fruit bats than to other microbats.|$|E
25|$|The fauna {{reported}} in the rainforests are found in all the national parks in the country. The reported fauna consists of 45 species of mammals including 13 species of lemurs which are: Diademed sifaka, black-and-white ruffed lemur, indri (Indri indri), hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis), aye-aye or the local endemic and endangered Lake Alaotra bamboo lemur. The endemic species in the park are: Malagasy primates consisting of five families which are lemurs; seven genera of Rodentia and six genera of Carnivora; 46 species of reptiles including Boa manditra (VU); 25 endemic and near-endemic species of mammals. Of these species, 22 are reported under threatened category, 8 species are under critically endangered list, 9 species are endangered, and 5 species are vulnerable. There are also many endemic species of <b>Chiroptera.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{molecular}} phylogeny of the <b>Chiroptera</b> is controversial, as {{it points to}} a microbat paraphyly, which implies that some seemingly unlikely transformations occurred. The first is that laryngeal echolocation evolved twice in bats, once in Yangochiroptera and once in the rhinolophoids. The second is that laryngeal echolocation had a single origin in <b>Chiroptera,</b> was subsequently lost in the family Pteropodidae (all megabats), and later evolved as a system of tongue-clicking in the genus Rousettus. Analyses of the sequence of the [...] "vocalization" [...] gene, FoxP2, were inconclusive as to whether laryngeal echolocation was secondarily lost in the pteropodids or independently gained in the echolocating lineages. However, analyses of the [...] "hearing" [...] gene, Prestin, seemed to favor the idea that echolocation developed independently at least twice, rather than there being a secondary loss in the pteropodids.|$|E
500|$|A {{prominent}} {{long and}} slender genital projection {{is present in}} {{both male and female}} bristle-faced free-tailed bats. The function of the projection remains unknown but these features are not shared by any other Australian <b>Chiroptera</b> [...] with the exception of Mormopterus norfolkensis. Males of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat also possess unique serrated lateral flanges on the acutely pointed glans penis. Features of the dentition of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat are also unique this species.|$|E
500|$|Bats are mammals of {{the order}} <b>Chiroptera</b> ( [...] ; from the [...] – cheir, [...] "hand" [...] and πτερόν – pteron, [...] "wing") whose forelimbs form webbed wings, making them the only mammals {{naturally}} capable of true and sustained flight. By contrast, other mammals said to fly, such as flying squirrels, gliding possums, and colugos, can only glide for short distances. Bats are less efficient at flying than birds, but are more manoeuvrable, using their very long spread-out digits which are covered with a thin membrane or patagium.|$|E

2500|$|Megabats {{constitute}} the suborder Megachiroptera, and its only family Pteropodidae {{of the order}} <b>Chiroptera</b> (bats). They are also called fruit bats, Old World fruit bats, or, especially the genera Acerodon and Pteropus, flying foxes. [...] Megabats are {{not found in the}} Americas, Western Europe, northwest Africa and southwest Australia. Compared to insectivorous bats, fruit bats are relatively large and, with some exceptions, do not navigate by echolocation. They are herbivores and rely on their keen senses of sight and smell to locate food.|$|E
2500|$|Almost all {{plant and}} animal species {{synthesize}} vitamin C. Notable mammalian exceptions include most or all of the order <b>Chiroptera</b> (bats), and one of the two major primate suborders, the [...] "Anthropoidea" [...] (Haplorrhini) which include tarsiers, monkeys, and apes, including human beings. The Strepsirrhini (non-tarsier prosimians) can make their own vitamin C, and these include lemurs, lorises, pottos, and galagos. Ascorbic acid is also not synthesized by at least two species of Caviidae, the capybara and the guinea pig. There are known species of birds and fish that do not synthesize their own Vitamin C. All species that do not synthesize ascorbate require it in the diet. Deficiency causes scurvy in humans, and somewhat similar symptoms in other animals.|$|E

6000|$|I {{will first}} give briefly {{all the cases}} known to me of male quadrupeds differing in colour from the females. With Marsupials, as I am {{informed}} by Mr. Gould, the sexes rarely differ in this respect; but the great red kangaroo offers a striking exception, [...] "delicate blue being the prevailing tint in {{those parts of the}} female which in the male are red." [...] (19. Osphranter rufus, Gould, 'Mammals of Australia,' 1863, vol. ii. On the Didelphis, Desmarest, 'Mammalogie,' p. 256.) In the Didelphis opossum of Cayenne the female {{is said to be a}} little more red than the male. Of the Rodents, Dr. Gray remarks: [...] "African squirrels, especially those found in the tropical regions, have the fur much brighter and more vivid at some seasons of the year than at others, and the fur of the male is generally brighter than that of the female." [...] (20. 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History,' Nov. 1867, p. 325. On the Mus minutus, Desmarest, 'Mammalogie,' p. 304.) Dr. Gray informs me that he specified the African squirrels, because, from their unusually bright colours, they best exhibit this difference. The female of the Mus minutus of Russia is of a paler and dirtier tint than the male. In a large number of bats the fur of the male is lighter than in the female. (21. J.A. Allen, in 'Bulletin of Mus. Comp. Zoolog. of Cambridge, United States,' 1869, p. 207. Mr. Dobson on sexual characters in the <b>Chiroptera,</b> 'Proceedings of the Zoological Society,' 1873, p. 241. Dr. Gray on Sloths, ibid. 1871, p. 436.) Mr. Dobson also remarks, with respect to these animals: [...] "Differences, depending partly or entirely on the possession by the male of fur of a much more brilliant hue, or distinguished by different markings or by the greater length of certain portions, are met only, to any appreciable extent, in the frugivorous bats in which the sense of sight is well developed." [...] This last remark deserves attention, as bearing on the question whether bright colours are serviceable to male animals from being ornamental. In one genus of sloths, it is now established, as Dr. Gray states, [...] "that the males are ornamented differently from the females--that is to say, that they have a patch of soft short hair between the shoulders, which is generally of a more or less orange colour, and in one species pure white. The females, on the contrary, are destitute of this mark." ...|$|E
