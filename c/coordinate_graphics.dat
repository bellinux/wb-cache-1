In WIP, decisions of the language generator may influence graphics generation and graphical constraints may sometimes force decisions in the language production process, In this paper, we focus on the influence of graphical constraints on text generation. In particular, we describe the generation of cross-modal references, the revision of text due to graphical constraints and the clarification of graphics through text...|$|E

40|$|Background & aims: Malnutrition (over and under-nutrition) {{is highly}} {{prevalent}} in patients admitted to hospital {{and it is}} a well-known risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality. Nutritional problems are often misdiagnosed, and especially the coexistence of over and undernutrition is not usually recognized. We aimed to develop and validate a screening tool for the easy detection and reporting of both undernutrition and overnutrition, specifically identifying the clinical conditions where the two types of malnutrition coexist. Methods: The study consisted of three phases: 1) selection of an appropriate study population (estimation sample) and of the hospital admission parameters to identify overnutrition and undernutrition; 2) combination of selected variables to create a screening tool to assess the nutritional risk in case of undernutrition, overnutrition, or the copresence of both the conditions, to be used by non-specialist health care professionals; 3) validation of the screening tool in a different patient sample (validation sample). Results: Two groups of variables (12 for undernutrition, 7 for overnutrition) were identified in separate logistic models for their correlation with the outcome variables. Both models showed high efficacy, sensitivity and specificity (overnutrition, 97. 7 %, 99. 6 %, 66. 6 %, respectively; undernutrition, 84. 4 %, 83. 6 %, 84. 8 %). The logistic models were used to construct a two-faced test (named JaNuS - Just A Nutritional Screening) fitting into a two-dimension Cartesian <b>coordinate</b> <b>graphic</b> system. In the validation sample the JaNuS test confirmed its predictive value. Internal consistency and test-retest analysis provide evidence for the reliability of the test. Conclusion: The study provides a screening tool for the assessment of the nutritional risk, based on parameters easy-to-use by health care personnel lacking nutritional competence and characterized by excellent predictive validity. The test might be confidently applied in the clinical setting to determine the importance of malnutrition (including the copresence of over and undernutrition) as a risk factor for morbidity and mortality. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Scientists {{increasingly}} use ensemble {{data sets}} to explore relationships present in dynamic systems. Ensemble data sets combine spatio-temporal simulation results generated using multiple numerical models, sampled input conditions and perturbed parameters. While ensemble data sets are {{a powerful tool}} for mitigating uncertainty, they pose significant visualization and analysis challenges due to their complexity. In this article, we present Ensemble-Vis, a framework consisting of a collection of overview and statistical displays linked through a high level of interactivity. Ensemble-Vis allows scientists to gain key scientific insight into the distribution of simulation results as well as the uncertainty associated with the scientific data. In contrast to methods that present large amounts of diverse information in a single display, we argue that combining multiple linked displays yields a clearer presentation of the data and facilitates a greater level of visual data analysis. We demonstrate our framework using driving problems from climate modeling and meteorology and discuss generalizations to other fields.

The project summary is stored as a Windows 3. 11 Write file on the same disk as Part 1 AC Tutorial. nb. The notebooks must be {{used in conjunction with}} Mathematica 3. 0. 1 software operating in a Windows 95 environment, and it is assumed that the student has previously studied direct current (DC) electricity, resistance, capacitance, and inductance. The series of tutorials allows the student to interactively investigate the theoretical behavior of simple {{alternating current}} (AC) circuits that include various combinations of resistance, capacitance, and inductance. The notebook series progresses from purely resistive circuits to resistive, inductive, and capacitive (RLC) circuits, building gradually upon previous concepts in an interactive fashion. Generally, background AC circuit theory is provided, and then simple circuits are analyzed as examples. Mathematica 3. 0. 1 is often employed in the example analyses, thereby additionally providing the student with complementary instruction in Mathematica. For example, the math software is used to solve for particular variables, calculate, differentiate, and integrate. Also, plots and graphics are emphasized throughout the tutorial to enhance student assimilation of the most important concepts. After the tutorial presents terminology, background theory, and worked examples, the student may then be asked to provide answers to simple calculations, conceptual queries, or more involved problems before advancing to the next complexity or topic. The student is encouraged to use Mathematica 3. 0. 1 to perform these tasks although other methods are certainly acceptable. Upon producing a response, the student will then check his or her answer by examining the postceding cells that usually obscure the problem solution until the cells are manually opened by the student. Additionally, the student may be encouraged to manipulate the input data to particular problems to observe how the outcomes respond to the student's parameter changes. This practice helps to provide the student with a conceptual understanding of the relationships between different variables, quantities, or concepts. The notebooks were developed during the fall of 1997 and the spring of 1998. A great deal of additional effort was put into obtaining the Mathematica 3. 0. 1 software, installing it, and achieving proper functioning. The circuit diagrams and the impedance diagrams were developed by using Windows 3. 11 Paintbrush, saving the Paintbrush file, and then importing the file into Windows 95 Paint where additional alterations may have been made. The "Insert Object" command of the Mathematica 3. 0. 1 "Edit" drop-down menu was then selected. This command brings up a Paint window. The graphic was then copied from the first Windows 95 Paint window to the Windows 95 Paint palette that was activated by the "Insert Object" command. Additional alterations may then have been made. Finally, the object was updated and placed in the appropriate. Mathematica notebook.
