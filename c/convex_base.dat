2500|$|The {{spacecraft}} was cone shaped, with a neck at {{the narrow}} end. It had a <b>convex</b> <b>base,</b> which carried {{a heat shield}} (Item 2 in the diagram below) consisting of an aluminum honeycomb covered with multiple layers of fiberglass. Strapped to it was a retropack (1) consisting of three rockets deployed to brake the spacecraft during reentry. Between these were three minor rockets for separating the spacecraft from the launch vehicle at orbital insertion. The straps that held the package could be severed when {{it was no longer}} needed. Next to the heat shield was the pressurized crew compartment (3). Inside, an astronaut would be strapped to a form-fitting seat with instruments {{in front of him and}} with his back to the heat shield. Underneath the seat was the environmental control system supplying oxygen and heat, scrubbing the air of CO2, vapor and odors, and (on orbital flights) collecting urine. The recovery compartment (4) at the narrow end of the spacecraft contained three parachutes: a drogue to stabilize free fall and two main chutes, a primary and reserve. Between the heat shield and inner wall of the crew compartment was a landing skirt, deployed by letting down the heat shield before landing. On top of the recovery compartment was the antenna section (5) containing both antennas for communication and scanners for guiding spacecraft orientation. Attached was a flap used to ensure [...] the spacecraft was faced heat shield first during reentry. A launch escape system (6) was mounted to the narrow end of the spacecraft containing three small solid-fueled rockets which could be fired briefly in a launch failure to separate the capsule safely from its booster. It would deploy the capsule's parachute for a landing nearby at sea. (See also Mission profile for details.) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a <b>convex</b> {{optimization}} <b>based</b> approach for piecewise planar reconstruction. We {{show that the}} task of reconstructing a piecewise planar environment can be set in an L ∞ based Homographic framework that iteratively computes scene plane and camera pose parameters. Instead of image points, the algorithm optimizes over inter-image homographies. The resultant objective functions are minimized using Second Order Cone Programming algorithms. Apart from showing the convergence of the algorithm, we also empirically verify its robustness to error in initialization through various experiments on synthetic and real data. We intend this algorithm to be in between initialization approaches like decomposition methods and iterative non-linear minimization methods like Bundle Adjustment. 1 Introduction and Related Work In this paper, we describe a <b>convex</b> optimization <b>based</b> approach for piecewise planar reconstruction by optimizing inter-image homographies.
