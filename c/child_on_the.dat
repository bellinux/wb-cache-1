5|$|During the campaign, Old Court {{supporters}} again {{raised the}} issue of Sharp's seduction and abandonment of Anna Cooke. Old Court supporter John Upshaw Waring printed handbills that not only accused Sharp of fathering Cooke's child, but said that Sharp had denied paternity of the <b>child</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds that it was a mulatto and the son of a Cooke family slave. Whether Sharp made such a claim has never been determined. Despite the allegations, Sharp won the election.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Pauline was {{a cornerstone of}} EastEnders; the lynchpin of the Fowler/Beale family around whom the soap was originally structured. At {{the beginning of the}} serial in 1985, Pauline was a 40-year-old married mother with two teenage children, Mark and Michelle, and another <b>child</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way. The fictional history of her younger years has been told via behind-the-scenes books such as EastEnders: The Inside Story, and the second tie-in novel by Hugh Miller, Swings and Roundabouts, which explains that Pauline was born and raised at 45 Albert Square, where she lived for her entire life. She married Arthur Fowler in 1965, raising her own children in the same house where she grew up.|$|E
40|$|Existing {{research}} indicates that typically developing children pass through predictable stages of fear development throughout their childhood. Evidence suggests that in general, children with disabilities experience more fears than typically developing children. Children with disabilities share similar stages of fear development compared to typically developing children, but at a delayed rate, with a more protracted course. <b>Children</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> autism spectrum experience higher levels of anxiety, compared to other children. Limited fear research in <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> autism spectrum suggests that they exhibit a unique fear profile compared to their peers, however, {{little is known about}} why this may be. Chapter 1 reviews published literature on fear development for typically developing children, children with physical and intellectual disabilities, and <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> autism spectrum. Chapter 2 presents an empirical study that investigates the relationship between sensory processing and fear profiles in <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> autism spectrum. The results support the notion that sensory experiences may account for a proportion of the unique fear pattern experienced by <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> autism spectrum. The thesis concludes with a reflective account that reviews the process of conducting internet-mediated research <b>on</b> <b>children</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> autism spectrum.

5|$|The Joes {{locate the}} secret base and fly there, as McCullen loads three {{missiles}} with nanowarheads, which are aimed for Beijing, Moscow, and Washington, DC, the world's {{three most important}} cities. He intends {{to do this to}} strike fear into the hearts of every man, woman, and <b>child</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> planet, after which they will turn to the person with the most power in the world, the President of the United States. After Snake Eyes takes out one missile, Ripcord destroys the remaining two by using a stolen M.A.R.S. prototype Night Raven jet, while Scarlett, Breaker, and Snake Eyes infiltrate the base. Snake Eyes duels and prevails over Storm Shadow. Duke learns that the Doctor is Rex Lewis, Ana's brother, believed to have been killed by a mistimed airstrike during a mission led by Duke (also the origin of the alienation between Duke and Ana). Rex had encountered Doctor Mindbender (Kevin J. O'Connor) in the bunker and was seduced by the nanomite technology, taking too long to retrieve the data and getting caught in the bombing, which disfigured him. After freeing Duke, the Baroness is subdued, as the Doctor reveals he has implanted her with nanomites, which has put her under his control for the past four years. Attempting to kill Duke, McCullen ends up being burned, so the Doctor and he flee to an escape vessel. Duke and the Baroness pursue him while the Joes fall back; when the Doctor activates the base's self-destruct sequence, which involves 'blowing the ice cap' to create blocks of ice which then nearly crush the Joes.|$|E

Furthermore, in the case of E.B. v. France (2008), the Grand Chamber of the Strasbourg Court ruled that the authorities' refusal to allow a person to adopt a <b>child</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of sexual orientation creates a difference of treatment incompatible with human rights.

25|$|Buchenwald {{concentration}} camp, early 1945. A Polish prisoner named Jankowski, who {{has been}} on a death march from Auschwitz, brings a suitcase to the camp. When the inmates in the storage building open it, they discover a three-year-old child. Jankowski tells them he is the son of a couple from the Warsaw Ghetto, both of whom perished.

He is instructed to send the <b>child</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next transport to Sachsenhausen. Höfel cannot bring himself to do so, and hides him. Jankowski is deported to Sachsenhausen alone.|$|E
25|$|The {{restoration}} of Constantine I at first {{did not bring}} any change to Aspasia's situation. Considered intriguing by part of the Royal Family, especially by her sister-in-law Princess Elisabeth of Romania who hated her, she was under the suspicion {{that she wanted to}} put her unborn <b>child</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> throne. The Royal Family feared the birth of a male child, which could further complicate the political situation at a time when Greece was already at war against the Ottoman Empire. However, not all members of the Royal Family, shared this distrust: Princess Alice of Battenberg, aunt of the deceased Alexander I, chose to spend Christmas of 1920 in the company of Aspasia. For her part, Queen Sophia, who previously strongly opposed the relationship of her son with Aspasia, approaches her daughter-in-law and awaited birth of her first grandchild.|$|E

25|$|Dīkṣā (Sanskrit: दीक्षा). Reṇukā {{does not}} feel any weight, nor is troubled by the pregnancy. Jamadagni {{performs}} the Puṃsavana ceremony of Reṇukā, traditionally performed in the eighth month of pregnancy. All good omens happen for Reṇukā. The seven seers (Saptarṣi) bless her and the nine planets become favourable. Reṇukā gives birth to a <b>child</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third day of the bright half of Vaiśākha month, known as Akṣayatṛtīyā. The deities, seers, and devotees rejoice. On the instruction of Bhṛgu, the child is named as Rāma by Jamadagni. Rāma is very fond of a toy-axe, and so he is also called Paraśurāma. The child tames and plays with wild animals like lions and tigers. Five years pass by, and ten Saṃskāras ("rites of passage") of the child are completed. Then the Upanayana ("sacred thread ceremony") ceremony of Paraśurāma is performed. Brahmā is the giver of the sacred thread, Śiva initiates {{the child in the}} Gayatrī Mantra, and Paraśurāma begs Reṇukā for alms. The canto ends with Paraśurāma going to the Kailāsa mountain to learn from his guru Śiva.|$|E
25|$|A {{family name}} is {{typically}} {{a part of}} a person's personal name which, according to law or custom, is passed or given to children from one or both of their parents' family names. The use of family names is common in most cultures around the world, with each culture having its own rules as to how these names are formed, passed and used. However, the style of having both a family name (surname) and a given name (forename) is far from universal. In many countries, it is common for ordinary people to have only one name or mononym, with some cultures not using family names. Also, in most Slavic countries, in Greece and Iceland, for example, there are different family name forms for male and female members of the family. Issues of family name arise especially on the passing of a name to a new-born <b>child,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> adoption of a common family name on marriage, on renouncing of a family name and on changing of a family name.|$|E
25|$|Episode five: Bianca and Andy - Bianca {{was very}} much {{looking forward to the}} time when her husband Andy {{returned}} from an eighteen-year stint serving with the RAF. The thirty-four-year-old couple were reunited to help bring up their growing family. But events did not run as expected. With three boys under ten, and a fourth <b>child</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way, Bianca feels over-worked and unappreciated by her partner. Meanwhile, Andy does not adjust easily to spending so much time at home and now feels there is no communication in the partnership. Andy makes an effort to dress up for college, but at home Bianca only sees him in old jeans with socks and sandals. Woodall and Constantine question whether a new wardrobe can help the couple's marriage. Woodall helps Bianca to embrace her growing pregnancy bump with carefully fitted dresses and tops. With the help of hairdresser Richard Ward the couple are transformed and given a fresh look and made to feel happier and more comfortable together in their relationship.|$|E
