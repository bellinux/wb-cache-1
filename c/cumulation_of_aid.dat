40|$|In this chapter, I {{turn to a}} {{historical}} accounting {{of the development of}} Commission procedures and powers, and to the changing background conditions in which state aid controls existed. I focus on those developments which bear most strongly on the Commission’s ability to exercise effective control. The exposition will be partly chronological and partly thematic. First, I will examine the first major application <b>of</b> state <b>aid</b> rules, export aid for intra-Community trade. Second, I will turn to early Commission efforts in the area <b>of</b> regional <b>aid,</b> in which the system <b>of</b> differentiated <b>aid</b> maxima for different regions of the Community were created and expanded. Third, I will consider the impact that the addition of new, poorer member states has had on state aid policy. Fourth, I consider Commission efforts in two important sectors, textiles and automobiles. Fifth, I analyze the introduction and development of the most important horizontal framework, that for research and development. Sixth, the focus shifts to the question of efforts to evade legal history <b>of</b> state <b>aid</b> rules and their application. In particular, this will focus on Commission initiatives such as the Transparency Directive and the rules on <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>aids,</b> and especially on the use of repayment orders beginning in the mid- 1980 s. Seventh, I consider the crucial cases defining the powers of the Commission (in particular, Philip Morris) and the rights of third parties. Finally, I analyze in detail the political underpinnings <b>of</b> reinforced state <b>aid</b> control beginning in the mid- 1980 s...|$|R

In particular the reconstruction of household budget surveys should deliver yearly results as well multi-annual sufficient large samples to allow in depth analyses. This study contributes by a general conceptual foundation <b>of</b> the <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> cross-sections and an application which in particular evaluates the new cumulation concept with actual large official samples: the cross sectional <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> five yearly Continuous Household Budget Surveys (Laufende Wirtschaftsrechnungen, LWR) which will be compared to the large quinquennial Sample Survey of Income and Expenditures (Einkommens- und Verbrauchsstichprobe, EVS) of the German Federal Statistical Office.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the effects <b>of</b> a {{diagonal}} <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> origin as the EU’s Common Commercial Policy (CCP) incentive mechanism that affects the intraregional trade and transaction cost structure of firms engaged in cross-border business operation. The research explores how firms should frame their crossborder physical flows of goods and the configuration of their value-adding processes for taking advantage <b>of</b> diagonal <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> origin. The empirical analysis {{is based on an}} in-depth case study of effects of the ‘SAP+ diagonal <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> origin’ on changes in the transaction cost structure of a selected Slovenian firm operating within the household-appliance sector in one of the Western Balkan Countries. Based on eligibility of local subsidiary for using origin of goods in its import/export transactions the cost calculations were made for its products and then three different business scenarios were developed for showing the effects of the mechanism on transaction cost changes of a firm. The paper concludes that, at the conceptual level, the mechanism <b>of</b> diagonal <b>cumulation</b> oforigin may serve as an effective institutional cross-border trade-promoting too...|$|R

40|$|Previous studies {{argue that}} the <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> mediations {{generally}} decreases uncertainty and ultimately helps to solve a conflict peacefully. Yet the empirical evidence for this is inconclusive, suggesting that existent theoretical accounts might be incomplete. For addressing this shortcoming, the paper develops an argument for a curvilinear relationship between the <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> mediations and mediation effectiveness. Based upon this rationale, it is less likely that initial mediation attempts succeed, but-after a turning point has been reached-subsequent mediations {{are more likely to}} induce an effective resolution of a dispute. The author also argues that this effect should be stronger if the same actors mediate {{over the course of a}} conflict. The empirical implications of this theoretical revision are tested in a quantitative framework employing data for 1816 - 2001. The results provide strong support for the theory. © The Author(s) 2013...|$|R
