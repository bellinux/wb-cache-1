40|$|Effects of evaporation/condensation on {{spreading}} {{and contact}} angle were experimentally studied. A sessile drop of R- 113 was tested at different vapor environments {{to determine the}} effects of evaporation/condensation on the evolution of <b>contact</b> <b>diameter</b> and contact angle of the drop. Condensation on the drop surface occurs at both the saturated and a nonsaturated vapor environments and promotes the spreading. When the drop is placed in the saturated vapor environment it tends to completely wetting and spreads rapidly. In a nonsaturated vapor environment, the evolution of the sessile drop is divided three stages: condensation-spreading stage, evaporation-retracting stage and rapid contracting stage. In the first stage the drop behaves as in the saturated environment. In the evaporation -retracting stage, the competition between spreading and evaporation of the drop determines the evolution characteristics of the <b>contact</b> <b>diameter</b> and the contact angle. A lower evaporation rate struggles against the spreading power to turn the drop from spreading to retracting with a continuous increase of the contact angle. The drop placed in open air has a much higher evaporation rate. The strong evaporation suppresses the spreading and accelerates the retraction of the drop with a linear decrease of the <b>contact</b> <b>diameter.</b> The contraction of the evaporating drops is gradually accelerated when the <b>contact</b> <b>diameter</b> decreases to 3 min and less till drying up, though the evaporation rate is gradually slowing down...|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of droplets impacting and evaporating {{on a hot}} surface is of interest {{in many areas of}} engineering. Quantitative measurement of these processes provides great help to reveal the physics behind. A novel technique was developed to quantitatively measure the volume evolution and <b>contact</b> <b>diameter</b> of an evaporating microdroplet on a hot surface utilizing interference fringe scattering method. In this method, fine fringes produced by the interference of two coherent laser beams was scattered by the droplet and projected onto a screen. The profile and volume of the droplet can be derived from the spatial fringe spacing on the screen. The number of total fringes measurable on the screen was used to determine the instantaneous <b>contact</b> <b>diameter</b> of the microdroplet. Validation experiments demonstrated that the measurement errors are less than ? 5 ? and ± 1 ?, for microdroplet volume and <b>contact</b> <b>diameter,</b> respectively. By using this method, the dynamic of droplet impingement, evaporation and boiling using ethanol, pure water and water solution of a surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate) with impact velocity of 7. 5 m/s and diameters ranged from 0. 19 to 0. 46 mm were investigated. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Ping-pong balls were {{employed}} to experimentally study the deformation and buckling behaviors of thin-walled spherical shells compressed onto a rigid plate. First, the quasi-static tests were conducted on an MTS tester, in which the ball was compressed onto a PMMA plate. The compression force and displacement of the crosshead were obtained by the MTS, while {{the evolution of the}} contact zone between the ball and the plate was recorded by a digital camera. Two transition points were identified from the load-displacement curve and a snap-through buckling gradually happened after the contact zone reaches a critical size. By correlating the evolution in the contact zone and the load-displacement curve, it is found that the two transition points are corresponding to the traveling of the plastic hinges around the contact zone and the unrecoverable buckling, respectively. In dynamic tests, the ping pong ball accelerated by an air-gun impacted onto a PMMA plate with the velocity ranging 10 - 50 m/s, whilst the dynamic deformation process of the contact zone was captured by a high-speed digital camera.

Using micropatterning with a receptor trans-endocytosis assay, we show that signaling between pairs of cells correlates with their contact area. This relationship extends across <b>contact</b> <b>diameters</b> ranging from micrometers to tens of micrometers. Mathematical modeling predicts that dependence of signaling on contact area can bias cellular differentiation in Notch-mediated lateral inhibition processes, such that smaller cells {{are more likely to}} differentiate into signal-producing cells.

40|$|Abstract: A {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT), in theory, has an unlimited {{number of gear ratios}} between the highest and lowest settings. But most CVTs are complex, expensive, have poor efficiencies, and aren't scalable. A new type of CVT, CONTINUOSLY VARIABLE PLANETARY TRANSMISSION(CVPT),combines toroidaltraction CVT with the versatility of the planetary gear arrangement to create a low-cost, highly efficient drive for human-powered and motorized vehicles. While the CVPT uses rolling traction to distribute torque like toroidal CVTs, it distributes the transmitted torque over several spheres in an inherently stable configuration. The rotating balls between the input and output section of the CVT tilt to vary transmission speed. As the balls tilt, they change their <b>contact</b> <b>diameters</b> to vary the speed ratio. This lowers contact pressures and improves durability, stability, and torque density. And since it uses a planetary arrangement, torque can be summed or divided. In the present work, a CVPT has been mounted to a bicycle for conducting the experiments. Normally tilting of spheres for changing gear ratios is done manually, however in our case, this has been obtained automatically. For automated shifting, a shift actuator, a controller and a battery to power this circuit is used. Also, results have been obtained with speed variations of a bicycle with and without CVPT.

40|$|The use of {{a liquid}} spray that {{subsequently}} undergoes a liquid to vapor phase change can efficiently remove heat at low degrees of superheat from electronic circuits, lasers and turbine blades, etc. In the process of spray cooling, the impingement of high velocity droplets on the hot surface elicits complex droplet impact dynamics, phase change and two-phase flow, which cause difficulties {{in the understanding of}} the mechanism of spray cooling. Current research focuses on the fundamental phenomena affecting heat flux in spray cooling, including the evaporation process of individual droplets impinging on a flat surface and the physical mechanism that triggers critical heat flux. It is crucial to develop advanced optical diagnostic tools for analyzing these phenomena quantitatively. A novel laser interferometric method was developed to measure the <b>contact</b> <b>diameter,</b> profile, and volume of a liquid droplet evaporating on a hot quartz substrate. Validation experiments were conducted with different initial volumes of droplets. It is shown that an accuracy of ±l percent for the <b>contact</b> <b>diameter</b> measurement and ± 5 percent for the volume measurement can be achieved. By using this newly developed optical diagnostic method, the dynamic impingement, evaporation and boiling of a liquid droplet were investigated. Ethanol, pure water and a water solution of a surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate) were used. The impact velocity of the droplets was 7. 5 m/s and the diameters ranged from 0. 19 mm to 0. 46 mm. The evolutions of the <b>contact</b> <b>diameter,</b> profile and volume of the evaporating droplets were measured quantitatively. According to the measurement results of single-droplet evaporation, a new 2 -D model that takes the moving liquid-vapor interphase into consideration was proposed in toroidal coordinates. In order to extend the single-droplet model to the multi-droplet system, droplets expelled from the hot surface are taken into consideration. Expulsion rate, defined as the ratio of the outgoing liquid mass flux to the incoming liquid mass flux, was first introduced in this research. A concise analysis of the relation between heat flux and expulsion rate was derived, which indicates accurate measurement of spray characterization is helpful to reveal the mechanism of spray cooling. To improve the accuracy in spray characterization, a high accuracy laser phase-Doppler anemometry (PDA) system was developed. This system, based on a dual-mechanism scattering model, can greatly eliminate the measurement uncertainty caused by the measurement volume effect (MVE) in a conventional PDA system. Therefore, this PDA system provides an advanced tool for quantitatively analyzing the impacting and expelling droplet dynamics in spray cooling. By using the advanced PDA system, spray cooling with both pure water and water solutions containing 100 ppm by weight of sodium dodecyl sulfate was investigated. The liquid mass fluxes were ranged from 0. 156 Kg/m 2 s to 1. 20 Kg/m 2 s.

The objective of this thesis is to investigate a novel technique using an elastica loop to measure the work of adhesion between solid materials. Considering the range and resolution of the measured parameters, a specially designed apparatus with a precise displacement control system, an analytical balance, an optical system, and a computer control and data acquisition interface is constructed. An elastica loop made of poly(dimethylsiloxane) [PDMS] is attached directly to a stepper motor in the apparatus. To perform the measurement, the loop is brought into contact with various substrates as controlled by the computer interface, and information including the contact patterns, contact lengths, and contact forces is obtained. Experimental results indicate that due to anticlastic bending, the contact first occurs {{at the edges of the}} loop, and then spreads across the width as the displacement continues to increase. The patterns observed show that the loop is eventually flattened in the contact region and the effect of anticlastic bending of the loop is reduced.
