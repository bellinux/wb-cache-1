5|$|Braithwaite and Raghip were {{released}} immediately. Silcott remained {{in jail for}} the 1984 murder of Anthony Smith. He received £17,000 compensation in 1991 for his <b>conviction</b> <b>in</b> the Blakelock case, and in 1995 was offered up to £200,000 in legal aid to sue the police for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

5|$|Fritz Joubert Duquesne, a Boer and German spy, {{claimed to}} have assumed the {{identity}} of Russian Count Boris Zakrevsky and joined Kitchener in Scotland. Duquesne supposedly signalled a German U-boat shortly after departing Scapa Flow to alert them that Kitchener’s ship was approaching. He was then rescued by the submarine as Hampshire sank. In the 1930s and '40s, he ran the Duquesne Spy Ring and was captured by the FBI along with 32 other Nazi agents in the largest espionage <b>conviction</b> <b>in</b> U.S. history.|$|E

5|$|The CCRC finally {{rejected}} the application in April 2012 in a 109-page report, which said the submission had not identified any new evidence or legal argument that {{would raise the}} real possibility of the Court of Appeal overturning the <b>conviction.</b> <b>In</b> November 2012 the High Court turned down Bamber's application for a judicial review of that decision. The following year di Stefano was sentenced in the UK to 14 {{years in prison for}} having fraudulently presented himself as a lawyer. As of December 2013 Bamber's defence team was said to be preparing a fresh submission.|$|E
5|$|The first Myst titles used pre-rendered graphics, and {{digitally}} inserted {{footage of}} live actors into the backgrounds. For Myst V: End of Ages, {{a different approach}} was taken; a special camera recorded actor's faces and mapped the video onto digital models. The characters of Myst have been generally praised in each installment. Reviewers found that the live action characters increased immersion, while the digital body language and spoken <b>conviction</b> <b>in</b> End of Ages endeared the characters to the player. Dissenting reviewers considered Mysts acting overly melodramatic and overwrought.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 2010, Juventus {{considered}} challenging the stripping of their scudetti from 2005 and 2006, {{dependent on the}} results of trials connected to the 2006 scandal. Subsequent investigations found in 2011 that Juventus' relegation in 2006 was without merit. When former general manager Luciano Moggi's <b>conviction</b> <b>in</b> criminal court in connection with the scandal was thrown out by an appeals court in 2015, the club sued the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) for €443million for damages caused by their 2006 relegation.

5|$|Bryant and Milam {{were indicted}} for murder. The grand jury's prosecuting attorney, Hamilton Caldwell, was not {{confident}} {{that he could get}} a <b>conviction</b> <b>in</b> a case of white violence against a black male accused of insulting a white woman. A local black paper was surprised at the indictment and praised the decision, as did the New York Times. The high-profile comments published in Northern newspapers and by the NAACP were of concern to the prosecuting attorney, Gerald Chatham; he worried that his office {{would not be able to}} secure a guilty verdict, despite the compelling evidence. Having limited funds, Bryant and Milam initially had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them, but five attorneys at a Sumner law firm offered their services pro bono. Their supporters placed collection jars in stores and other public places in the Delta, eventually gathering $10,000 for the defense.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Burnham {{was living}} in California and was active in counterespionage for Britain. Much of it {{involved}} a famous Boer spy, Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne, who became a German spy in both World Wars and claimed to have killed Field Marshal Kitchener while en route {{to meet with the}} Russians. During the Second Boer War, Burnham and Duquesne were each under orders to assassinate the other, {{but it was not until}} 1910 that the two men first met while both were in Washington, D.C., separately lobbying Congress to pass a bill in favor of the importation of African game animals into the United States (H.R. 23621). Duquesne was twice arrested by the FBI and in 1942 he and 32 other Nazi agents (the Duquesne Spy Ring) were jailed for espionage in the largest spy ring <b>conviction</b> <b>in</b> U.S. history.|$|E
5|$|Federal DUI law {{differs from}} New Jersey law {{in that there}} are no {{mandatory}} minimum jail sentences, irrespective of the number of previous DUI convictions, and plea bargaining is allowed. A federal DUI conviction will result in unexpungeable criminal record. Federal courts cannot suspend a driver's license, but may notify the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission of a DUI <b>conviction.</b> <b>In</b> federal enclaves that are under the jurisdiction of other federal departments (e.g. Fish and Wildlife Service), it is unclear if drunk driving could be prosecuted since the Assimilative Crimes Act is inapplicable, and there is no federal law defining DUI on those properties.|$|E

5|$|For {{a second}} DUI <b>conviction</b> <b>in</b> a 10-year period, {{irrespective}} of BAC, {{there is a}} fine of $500–$1,000, 2–90 days imprisonment, a 2-year license suspension, an automobile insurance surcharge of $1,000 a year for 3 years, and installation of an ignition interlock device for 1 to 3 years after license restoration. A person who has 3 or more DUI convictions and a gap of less than 10 years since the last conviction incurs a fine of $1,000, 6 months imprisonment, a 10-year license suspension, an automobile insurance surcharge of $1,500 a year for 3 years, and installation of an ignition interlock device for 1 to 3 years after license restoration. Jail sentences issued in New Jersey for DUI are often served through work release programs (e.g. weekends in jail).|$|E
5|$|Goebel {{challenged}} the vote returns in several counties. While the challenges were being adjudicated, Goebel {{was shot by}} an unknown assassin; Goebel was ultimately declared {{the winner of the}} election, but died of his wounds two days after being sworn into office. Among those charged in Goebel's murder was Governor Taylor's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers. Powers employed Brown as his legal counsel during his first trial, which ended in a <b>conviction</b> <b>in</b> July 1900. Brown died January 11, 1904, in Henderson and was buried at the Fernwood Cemetery in that city. He was the namesake of, but not related to, 20th century Kentucky Congressman John Y. Brown, Sr.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} his first criminal <b>conviction</b> <b>in</b> November 1977, aged 15, for burglary.

In January 1980 he was convicted of two further crimes including theft of property from his lodgings the night before De Simone's murder. He was subsequently convicted of a series of burglaries committed in Portsmouth for which he received an 18-month custodial sentence of which he served 9months.
