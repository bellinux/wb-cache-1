However, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is the driving factor behind the L-T relation, the increase in dust mass and/or starburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. Our results show that the dust conditions in IR-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time: at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10 K lower than what is measured locally. This is manifested as a flattening of the L-T relation, suggesting that (U) LIRGs in the early Universe are typically characterised by a more extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalent sources.

The unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of survey selection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated, IR-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selection biases. We find that IR-luminous galaxies have spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with broad far-IR peaks characterized by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures in the 25 - 45 K range. Hot (T 45 K) SEDs and cold (T 25 K), cirrus-dominated SEDs are rare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts such as M 82 and <b>cool</b> <b>spirals</b> such as M 51.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} grains composed of an ice shell surrounding an olivine core as they pass through a spiral shock in a protoplanetary disk. We use published three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of massive self-gravitating protoplanetary disks to extract the thermodynamics of spiral shocks in the region between 10 and 20 AU from the central star. As the density wave passes, it heats the grains, causing them to lose their ice shell and resulting in a lowering of the grain opacity. In addition, since grains of different sizes will have slightly different temperatures, {{there will be a}} migration of ice from hotter grains to cooler ones. The rate of migration depends on the temperature of the background gas, so a grain distribution that is effectively stable for low temperatures can undergo an irreversible change in opacity if the gas is temporarily heated to above ~ 150 K. We find that the opacity can drop more and at a significantly faster rate throughout the spiral shocks relative to the prediction of the standard dust grain model adopted in hydrodynamical calculations of protoplanetary disks. This would lead to faster gas <b>cooling</b> within <b>spiral</b> arms. We discuss the implications of our results on the susceptibility of disks to fragment into sub-stellar objects at distances of a few tens of astronomical units...|$|R

Results show that the overall thermal effectiveness improved significantly when the temperature difference between the air flows is at 25 degrees.

40|$|Submillimetre {{observations}} {{reveal a}} cosmologically significant population of high-redshift dust-enshrouded galaxies. The form of evolution inferred {{for this population}} can be reconciled easily with COBE FIRAS and DIRBE measurements of the cosmic background radiation (CBR) at wavelengths > 100 microns. At shorter wavelengths, however, the 60 -micron CBR intensity reported by Finkbeiner et al. is less easily accounted for. Lagache et al. have proposed that this excess CBR emission is a warm Galactic component, and the detection of the highest-energy gamma-rays from blazars limits the CBR intensity at these wavelengths, but here we investigate sources of this excess CBR emission, assuming {{that it has a}} genuine extragalactic origin. We propose and test three explanations, each involving additional populations not readily detected in existing submm-wave surveys. First, dust-enshrouded galaxies with hot dust temperatures, perhaps dust-enshrouded, Compton-thick AGN as suggested by recent deep Chandra surveys. Secondly, a population of relatively low-redshift dusty galaxies with SEDs more typical of the existing submm-selected galaxies, which could plausibly be associated with the assembly of groups and clusters of galaxies. Thirdly, a population of low-luminosity, <b>cool,</b> quiescent <b>spiral</b> galaxies. Hot AGN and the assembly of groups can account for the excess 60 -micron background. There are significant problems with the cluster assembly scenario, in which too many bright IRAS sources are predicted. Spiral galaxies have the wrong SEDs to account for the excess. Future wide-field far-IR surveys using SIRTF and Herschel will sample representative volumes of the distant Universe, allowing any hot population of dusty AGNs and forming groups to be detected.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that lenticular (S 0) galaxies were initially spirals from which the gas has been removed by interactions with hot cluster gas, or by rampressure stripping of <b>cool</b> gas from <b>spirals</b> that are orbiting within rich clusters of galaxies. However, problems with this interpretation are that: (1) Some lenticulars, such as NGC 3115, are isolated field galaxies rather than cluster members. (2) The distribution of flattening values of S 0 galaxies in clusters, in groups and {{in the field are}} statistically indistinguishable. This is surprising because one might have expected most of the progenitors of field S 0 galaxies to have been flattened late-type galaxies, whereas lenticulars in clusters are thought to have mostly been derived from bulge-dominated early-type galaxies. (3) It should be hardest for ram-pressure to strip massive luminous galaxies with deep potential wells. However, no statistically significant differences are seen between the luminosity distributions of early-type Shapley-Ames galaxies in clusters, groups and in the field. (4) Finally both ram-pressure stripping and evaporation by hot intracluster gas would be most efficient in rich clusters. However, the small number of available data in the Shapley-Ames sample appears to show no statistically significant differences between the relative frequencies of dust-poor S 01 and dustrich S 03 galaxies in clusters, groups and in the field. It is tentatively concluded that ram-pressure stripping, and heating by intra-cluster gas, may not be the only evolutionary channels that lead to the formation of lenticular galaxies.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of velocity and temperature fields {{to explore the}} design of a single phase microchannel <b>cooling</b> system with <b>spiraling</b> radial inflow for high heat flux applications are presented. Total pressure drop and average wall heat flux are calculated for different flow rates and the effects of changing the microchannel height, flow inlet angle, and working fluid are investigated. Rotation of the fluid induces a crossflow and entrainment, this is found to enhance convective heat transfer considerably due to motion of fluid towards the heat exchange surface. The strength of this effect depends on the structure of hydrodynamic boundary layers, which is characterized by the Reynolds number and the flow inlet angle. The effect of reducing the Prandtl number is evaluated changing the working fluid from water to a 2 vol% and a 4 vol% water-Cu nanofluid suspension. For the cases studied, it is found that heat transfer enhancement by increasing the inlet swirl is greater than that of decreasing the Prandtl number using a nanofluid, though at a much higher pumping cost. In order to improve the performance of the device for high heat flux applications, admission of the flow should be as tangential as practically possible. It is found that, when reducing the microchannel height, boundary layers may merge and the entrainment effect is lost, therefore the total heat flux may not always increase with a decrease of the flow passage area, as opposed to conventional microchannels. The swirl flow microchannel heat sink showed promising cooling characteristics for applications such as thermal management of electronics or concentrated photovoltaics, with a ratio of pumping cost to heat rate of 0. 02 % for the base design studied.

40|$|Galaxy clusters, {{the largest}} gravitationally-bound {{structures}} in the universe, are composed of 50 - 1000 s of galaxies, hot X-ray emitting gas, and dark matter. They grow in size over time through cluster and group mergers. The merger history of a cluster can be imprinted on the hot gas, known as the intracluster medium (ICM). Merger signatures include shocks, cold fronts, and sloshing of the ICM, which can form spiral structures. Some clusters host double-lobed radio sources driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN). First, I will present {{a study of the}} galaxy cluster Abell 2029, which is very relaxed on large scales and has one of the largest continuous sloshing spirals yet observed in the X-ray, extending outward approximately 400 kpc. The sloshing gas interacts with the southern lobe of the radio galaxy, causing it to bend. Energy injection from the AGN is insufficient to offset <b>cooling.</b> The sloshing <b>spiral</b> may be an important additional mechanism in preventing large amounts of gas from cooling to very low temperatures. Next, I will present a study of Abell 98, a triple system currently undergoing a merger. I will discuss the merger history, and show that it is causing a shock. The central subcluster hosts a double-lobed AGN, which is evacuating a cavity in the ICM. Understanding the physical processes that affect the ICM is important for determining the mass of clusters, which in turn affects our calculations of cosmological parameters. To further constrain these parameters, as well as models of galaxy evolution, it is important to use a large sample of galaxy clusters over a range of masses and redshifts. Bent, double-lobed radio sources can potentially act as tracers of galaxy clusters over wide ranges of these parameters. I examine how efficient bent radio sources are at tracing high-redshift (z> 0. 7) clusters.
