50|$|Vice Versas are {{a type of}} {{chocolate}} produced in the UK by Nestlé, similar in composition to Galaxy Minstrels. A Vice Versa can exist {{in one of two}} varieties; one consisting of milk chocolate encased in a white <b>coloured</b> <b>sugar</b> coating; the other of white chocolate in a brown coating.|$|E
50|$|Eventually Zobel {{returned}} to Memmingen in Bavaria where {{he continued to}} successfully pursue his craft. Some of his work is displayed in Memmingen Town Hall. Haas was forced to give up sand painting, {{probably due to the}} ongoing disasters with his pictures. He opened a bakery in Windsor instead, and the icing on his cakes may well have been decorated with pictures in <b>coloured</b> <b>sugar</b> instead of sand.|$|E

40|$|The {{phenolic}} {{content of}} sugarcane varieties was analysed during 6, 10 and 12 months age. The total phenolic content (TPC) {{was found to}} increase from 10 to 20 mg/ 100 ml (6 months) to 70 – 90 mg/ 100 ml (12 months) and stabilize during peak maturity period. Concentration of phenolics {{was found to be}} higher at the top portion of the sugarcane. The raw juice from cane samples were clarified by defecation and 30 – 40 % removal of TPC was observed. The sugar samples and the intermediate process products collected from sugar factories were analysed for the phenolic content and colour. Dark <b>coloured</b> <b>sugars</b> and intermediate products were found to have higher phenolics. Enzymic browning due to polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity contributes significantly to colouring of cane juice. The absorbance increased to an extent of 70 – 80 % during the first 10 min of juice extraction. Colour input to sugar process can be reduced by inhibition of PPO activity of cane juice by chemical inhibitors and heating. Ascorbic acid alone inhibited PPO activity by 35 % and to an extent of 85 % combined with heating. Juice holding time in mills for 10 – 15 min increases enzymic browning hence; heating the juice instantly on extraction could reduce the colour formation to an extent of 40 %...|$|R
50|$|Sandpainting as a craft was {{inspired}} by King George III, who was a skilled watchmaker and craftsman in his own right, and {{took an interest in}} the skills demonstrated by royal functionaries, known as Table Deckers, who decorated the white table-cloths at royal banquets with ornate centre-pieces decorated by using unfixed <b>coloured</b> sands and <b>sugars</b> as 'paint', and a bird's feather as a 'brush' a craft introduced by a European traveller who had observed the craftsmen at work in Japan.|$|R
50|$|Kadalekai Parishe (ಕಡಲೆಕಾಯಿ ಪರಿಶೆ), is {{an annual}} {{groundnut}} fair held in Bangalore. This two-day fair is held near the Dodda Ganesha Temple in Basavanagudi. Apart from the Groundnuts, {{there are numerous}} stalls in the fair, selling Bangles, traditional toys and clay trinkets, plastic and glass dolls, Mehndi tattoos. There {{are a variety of}} food items, such as Bajji, Bonda, Batthaas (<b>Coloured</b> <b>sugar</b> candies), Kalyana seve or Bendu (Sugar coated gram) and Coloured sodas on sale during the fair.The NSS unit of BMS College of Engineering, Basavanagudi, distributed around 50,000 cloth bags to the vendors in 2014 followed by over 1,50,000 bags in 2015, to make the fair eco friendly. Over 200 groundnut vendors were benefited and the total plastic consumption at the fair came down by over 60%.|$|E
60|$|The hospitality, as {{brought in}} by two plump, well-fed lay-sisters, {{consisted}} of 'chickens in cretyne,' stewed in milk, seasoned with <b>sugar,</b> <b>coloured</b> with saffron, of potage of oysters, butter of almond-milk, and other delicate meats, such as had certainly never been tasted at Stirling or Dunbar. Lady Drummond's birth entitled her and Annis to sit at table with the Princesses and the Prioress, and she ventured to inquire after Esclairmonde de Luxembourg, or, as she was now called, Sister Clare of St. Katharine's.|$|R
5000|$|Originating in Europe, and {{probably}} {{based on the}} Japanese craft of bonseki (aka 'tray-painting'), marmotinto was fleetingly popular in England following a 1783 dinner party given by George III at Windsor Castle who was taken with a display of unfixed <b>coloured</b> sands, <b>sugars</b> and marble dust arranged under glass upon {{the surface of the}} dinner table in decorative patterns and including fruit and flowers, and exotic birds which was executed by the Bavarian table-decker Benjamin Zobel (Memmingen, 21 September 1762 - London, 24 October 1830), a friend of George Morland, a painter prominent in the [...] "Isle of Wight School". The King and his courtiers was so impressed with the resulting picture, it was suggested that Zobel {{find a way to make}} his compositions permanent and hence the craft of marmotinto or sandpainting was born and proved most successful under the patronage of various members of the royal household including the then Duke of York.|$|R
