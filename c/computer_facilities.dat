25|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, bromofluoroalkanes were in common use on aircraft, ships, and large {{vehicles}} {{as well as}} in <b>computer</b> <b>facilities</b> and galleries. However, concern was beginning to be expressed about the impact of chloroalkanes and bromoalkanes on the ozone layer. The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer did not cover bromofluoroalkanes as it was thought, at the time, that emergency discharge of extinguishing systems was too small in volume to produce a significant impact, and too important to human safety for restriction.|$|E
25|$|New Mexico State University has {{a branch}} campus located in Carlsbad, {{offering}} certificate, associate degree, bachelor's degree, and continuing education programs. NMSUC has a student population of approximately 2,000 {{and a staff}} of 104 faculty. Previously known as the Carlsbad Instructional Center, the campus was established in 1950 as the state's first community college. It was renamed a branch of NMSU in 1960. The present-day main building was built in 1980; an additional instruction center was added in 1987 and the <b>computer</b> <b>facilities</b> wing was completed in 1996. By 2011, the campus had added an additional building to house its nursing program, the Allied Health and University Transfer Center.|$|E

25|$|SAAO was {{established}} in January 1972, {{as a result of}} a joint agreement by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) of South Africa and Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) of United Kingdom. The headquarters are located on the grounds of the old Royal Observatory where the main building, offices, national library for astronomy and <b>computer</b> <b>facilities</b> are housed. Historic telescopes are also found at the headquarters in a number of domes and a small museum that displays scientific instruments. The South African Astronomical Observatory is administered at present as a National Facility under management of the National Research Foundation (NRF), formerly the Foundation for Research Development (FRD). In 1974, when the Radcliffe Observatory in Pretoria closed, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) purchased the 1.9 m Radcliffe telescope and transported it to Sutherland.|$|E
25|$|The Tornado ADV was {{designed}} {{to serve in the}} role of an interceptor against the threat of Soviet bombers, rather than as an air superiority fighter for engaging in prolonged air combat manoeuvering with various types of enemy fighters. In order to perform its anti-bomber primary mission, it was equipped with long range beyond visual range missiles such as the Skyflash, and later the AMRAAM; the aircraft also had the ability to stay aloft for long periods and remain over the North Sea and Northern Atlantic in order to maintain its airborne patrol. The Ministry of Defence acknowledged the Tornado ADV was not as significantly superior an aircraft to the Phantoms it had replaced in the air-defence role. However, the capability of its weapon systems was a dramatic improvement; in particular the radar and onboard <b>computer</b> <b>facilities.</b> Compared with the Phantom, the ADV had greater acceleration, twice the range and loiter time, and was more capable of operating from short 'austere' air strips.|$|E

40|$|E-training style {{requires}} a strong readiness level among industrial workers {{in order to}} ensure that gain its optimum advantages. The purpose of the study is to explore analytically how the demographic factors affect the computer usage attitude, <b>computer</b> literacy, <b>computer</b> <b>facility</b> and access technology. The study also explores analytically the e-training readiness level in terms of computer usage attitude, <b>computer</b> literacy, <b>computer</b> <b>facility</b> and access technology among industrial workers. Four hundreds industrial workers from electronic industries, food industries, poultry industries, and textile industries in Batu Pahat, Johore were involved in this study. The data were collected using questionnaires and were analyzed quantitatively. Through multiple regression analysis, the finding showed that some demographic factors (worker characteristics and work place) were significant at predicting the computer usage attitude, <b>computer</b> <b>facility</b> and technology access. the finding also showed that there was a high level of e-training readiness among industrial workers in the aspect of computer usage attitude. But the aspect of <b>computer</b> literacy, <b>computer</b> <b>facility,</b> and technology access showed only a moderate level of reediness. In general, the e-training readiness level of among industrial workers is still moderate. This situation should be overcome {{in order to ensure}} that the e-training approach has been emphasized in Malaysia Occupational Skills Development and Training Master Plan 2008 - 2020 would be implement successfully. Therefore, some suggestion for improvement have been presented toward enhance the e-training readiness among industrial workers...|$|R
5000|$|An earlier {{example of}} the notion of {{computing}} as utility was in 1965 by MIT's Fernando Corbató. Corbató and the other designers of the Multics operating system envisioned a <b>computer</b> <b>facility</b> operating “like a power company or water company”.|$|R
25|$|Because Britain did not test {{as often}} as the United States for {{financial}} and political reasons, {{and did not have}} the Americans' state-of-the-art <b>computer</b> <b>facilities,</b> British weapons design depended more on theoretical understanding, with potential for both greater advances and greater risks between tests.The low number of UK tests is misleading when compared to the large number of tests carried out by the US, the Soviet Union, China, and especially France, because the UK has had extensive access to US test data, obviating the need for UK tests. An added factor is that many tests were for 'weapon effects tests': tests not of the nuclear device itself, but of the nuclear effects on hardened components designed to resist ABM attack. Numerous such 'effects' tests were done in support of the Chevaline programme especially, and {{there is some evidence that}} some were permitted for the French programme to harden their RVs and warheads; because most French tests were under the ocean floor, access to measure 'weapon effects' was nearly impossible. An independent test programme would have seen the UK numbers soar to French levels.|$|E

The main entry is on the eighth level, which also contains a recital and special events auditorium with organ, lecture rooms, general and reserve libraries, offices, a domed theater, and a learning resource area. This auditorium is surrounded by glass on three sides, providing views of the city. The organ within it is a Scandinavian-made Marcussen organ. The aforementioned library on the same floor as the auditorium contains 10,000-15,000 volumes focusing largely on the Near East.|$|E

2500|$|Another odd {{feature of}} the Selectric {{terminals}} was the [...] "keyboard lock" [...] mechanism. [...] If the computer system a user was communicating with {{was too busy to}} accept input, it could send a code to mechanically interlock the keyboard so the user could not press any keys. The keyboard was also locked when the computer was typing, to avoid damaging the mechanism or interleaving user input and computer output in a confusing manner. [...] Though done to protect the print mechanism from damage, an unexpected keyboard lock activation could cause minor injury to a typist with a heavy touch. [...] There was little obvious warning that the keyboard had locked or unlocked, other than a faint click from the interlock solenoid, easily drowned out by the printer and fan noise in many <b>computer</b> <b>facilities.</b> [...] There was a small indicator light, but this was of little help to fast touch typists whose gaze was fixed on copy they were transcribing.|$|E
