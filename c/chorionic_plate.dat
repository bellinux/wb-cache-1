40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{distribution}} of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) in the human placenta at different gestational ages and to determine whether differences in ET- 1 immunoreactivity occurred in preeclamptic compared with uncomplicated pregnancies. METHODS: Localization of ET- 1 was investigated by the immunoperoxidase technique in first-trimester, second-trimester, and term human placentas from normal pregnancies and in placentas from preeclamptic pregnancies. RESULTS: In normal placentas from all gestational ages studied, endothelin- 1 immunoreactivity (ET- 1 IR) was specifically detected in the endothelium of the fetal vessels and in the syncytiotrophoblast. ET- 1 IR was also expressed by the villous cytotrophoblast of first- and second-trimester normal placentas. The extravillous cytotrophoblast of the basal and <b>chorionic</b> <b>plates</b> also exhibited ET- 1 IR, but with varying degrees of intensity. In preeclamptic placentas, the expression of ET- 1 IR was uneven with a negative staining in all placentas from pregnancies between the 29 th and 32 nd weeks of gestation. The expression of ET- 1 IR was most intense in some syncytiotrophoblast tissue in the terminal villi after the 33 rd week of gestation. In placentas from preeclamptic pregnancies between the 35 th and the 36 th weeks of gestation, strong ET- 1 IR expression was evident in the endothelium of fetal vessels and in the syncytiotrophoblast. Regardless of gestational age, ET- 1 IR was also observed in the extravillous cytotrophoblast of the basal and <b>chorionic</b> <b>plates</b> of preeclamptic placentas. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that ET- 1 IR is widely distributed in the human placenta and provides further evidence to support the concept that ET- 1 plays an important role as a modulator of vascular tone in the uteroplacental and fetoplacental units and may participate in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia...|$|R

The IGFs circulate in plasma principally as a ternary complex with the IGF binding protein- 3 and an acid-labile subunit (ALS), which increases their half life. Objectives: The objectives of the study were to determine whether the human placenta expresses the mRNA and protein for ALS and to evaluate any possible differences in the mRNA and protein for ALS in placentas from small (SGA) and appropriate (AGA) or gestational age newborns. Subjects/Methods:We studied the placentas from 47 AGA and 42 SGA pregnancies. IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF binding protein- 3, and ALS placental mRNA and protein contents were determined in both the basal and the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plates</b> of the placenta. Results: We observed that the human placenta expresses the gene and protein for ALS. The ALS mRNA in SGA was higher compared with AGA placentas (0. 15 +/- 0. 01 vs. 0. 12 +/- 0. 01 arbitrary units, respectively, P < 0. 05). In addition, the ALS protein content in SGA (31. 7 +/- 3. 3 pmol/g) was higher compared with AGA (22. 1 +/- 2. 3 pmol/g, P < 0. 05) placentas. Conclusion: We describe that the human placenta expresses the mRNA and the protein for ALS, and we observed an increase in ALS mRNA expression and protein content in SGA compared with AGA placentas.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to measure and portray blood {{movement}} in the placenta in vivo in normal and growth restricted pregnancies, using Intra Voxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) magnetic resonance imaging. Thirteen patients with apparently normal healthy pregnancies were scanned at 31 +/- 7 (mean+/-s. d.) weeks gestation and seven patients with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) were scanned at 31 +/- 4 weeks. A region of interest (ROI) was defined encompassing the placenta between the decidual and <b>chorionic</b> <b>plates.</b> The volume of moving blood within each imaging voxel of the ROI was then calculated as a percentage of the total voxel volume (f per cent). This information was colour coded to produce maps of moving blood volume. The placenta was segmented length ways into two zones of approximately equal area, termed inner and outer, the latter being adjacent to the uterine wall. f was fitted for the average in the outer zone (f(out)) and inner zone (f(in)). The parameter (f(out) -f(in)) was then calculated for each subject. This was positive in 12 / 13 of the normal cases and zero for one case (+ 10 per cent+ 10, mean+/-s. d.). For pregnancy affected by IUGR this value was negative in all cases (- 4 per cent+/- 3). Perfusion fraction mapping identified differences in function within the normal placenta in vivo, and between the placentae of normal and IUGR pregnancies.

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies of}} {{maternal}} {{risk factors for}} abnormal placental growth have focused on placental weight and placental ratio as measures of placental growth. We sought to identify maternal risk factors for placental weight and two neglected dimensions of placental growth: placental thickness and <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> area. Methods We conducted an analysis of 24, 135 mother-placenta pairs enrolled in the National Collaborative Perinatal Project, a prospective cohort study of pregnancy and child health. We defined growth restriction as th percentile and hypertrophy as > 90 th percentile for three placental growth dimensions: placental weight, placental thickness and <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> area. We constructed parallel multinomial logistic regression analyses to identify (a) predictors of restricted growth (vs. normal) and (b) predictors of hypertrophic growth (vs. normal). Results Black race was {{associated with an increased}} likelihood of growth restriction for placental weight, thickness and <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> area, but was associated with a reduced likelihood of hypertrophy for these three placental growth dimensions. We observed an increased likelihood of growth restriction for placental weight and <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> area among mothers with hypertensive disease at 24 weeks or beyond. Anemia was associated with a reduced likelihood of growth restriction for placental weight and <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> area. Pre-pregnancy BMI and pregnancy weight gain were associated with a reduced likelihood of growth restriction and an increased likelihood of hypertrophy for all three dimensions of placental growth. Conclusion Maternal risk factors are either associated with placental growth restriction or placental hypertrophy not both. Our findings suggest that the placenta may have compensatory responses to certain maternal risk factors suggesting different underlying biological mechanisms. </p...|$|E
40|$|During early pregnancy, {{the absence}} of fully {{developed}} internal organs means that the embryo is dependent on highly differentiated adnexal structures such as the secondary yolk sac and free-floating amniotic membrane {{as well as the}} placental trophoblast. In this review, we describe and illustrate the ultrastructural characteristics of these different cellular barriers which separate maternal and embryonic tissues during the first trimester of pregnancy. Samples of <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate,</b> umbilical cord, secondary yolk sac and amniotic membrane have been obtained from intact gestational sacs of pregnancies between 6 and 11 weeks and examined at the ultrastructural level. Features indicating intense biosynthetic activity were found in the syncytiotrophoblast of the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate,</b> the endoderm of the secondary yolk sac and mesenchymal cells of the amniotic membrane. Barriers {{in the form of a}} well-developed basal lamina were present between the trophoblast and mesenchyme of the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> and beneath the epithelium of the amniotic membrane and umbilical cord, but were incomplete between the mesenchymal tissues of the yolk sac and mesothelial and endodermal layers, and also around the capillaries of the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate.</b> Basement membrane thickening and interactions with the underlying stroma were observed with increasing gestational age in connection with amniotic epithelial differentiation and development of basal foot processes. After 9 weeks, the yolk sac showed a marked degeneration of surface cells, accompanied by increased fibrosis of the mesenchyme. These findings are discussed with reference to the biological functions of the adnexal structures in the development of the growing embryo, and their possible role is assessed in the physiology of exchange during the first trimester of pregnancy. © 1995.

To explore {{whether this was}} reflected in similar placentation, we examined eight delivered placentae from the Amazonian manatee using light microscopy and immunohistochemistry. In addition, the fetal placental circulation was described by scanning electron microscopy of vessel casts. The manatee placenta was zonary and endotheliochorial, {{like that of the}} elephant. The interhaemal barrier comprised maternal endothelium, cytotrophoblasts and fetal endothelium. We found columnar trophoblast beneath the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> and lining lacunae in this region, but there was no trace in the term placenta of haemophagous activity. The gross anatomy of the cord and fetal membranes was consistent with previous descriptions and included a four-chambered allantoic sac, as also found in the elephant and other afrotherians. Connective tissue septae descended from the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> and carried blood vessels to the labyrinth, where they gave rise to a dense capillary network.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: (1) To {{investigate}} a possible association between myometrial and placental artery vasoreactivity and perfusion at the basal and chorionic plates, respectively. (2) To confirm that myometrial arteries from women with pre-eclampsia and {{intrauterine growth restriction}} exhibit an attenuated endothelium-dependent vasodilatory response. METHODS: Women with normal pregnancy, pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction had a magnetic resonance scan to assess placental perfusion using a technique called intravoxel incoherent motion. At delivery, myometrial and <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> placental arteries were assessed on a wire myograph. Vessels were pre-constricted with the thromboxane mimetic U 46619 and dilated with incremental doses of bradykinin. RESULTS: Pre-constricted myometrial arteries from women with pre-eclampsia or intrauterine growth restriction exhibited an attenuated vasodilatory response to bradykinin, compared with normal pregnancy (P < 0. 0001). Pre-constricted placental arteries exhibited a minimal vasodilatory response in all three groups of women (P = 0. 10). Maximal constrictor and vasodilatory responses of myometrial arteries were not associated with the perfusing fraction at the basal plate.

The functional role of the placenta takes place mainly in the capillary system; however, ultrasound imaging of fetal blood flow is commonly performed on the umbilical artery, or on its first branches over the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the structural organization of the feto-placental vasculature of the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate.</b> Casting of the placental vasculature was performed on 15 full-term placentas using a dental polymer mixed with colored ink. Observations of the cast models revealed that the branching architecture of the chorionic vessel is a combination of dichotomous and monopodial patterns, where the first two to three generations are always of a dichotomous nature. Analysis of the daughter-to-mother diameter ratios in the chorionic vessels provided a maximum in the range of 0. 6 – 0. 8 for the dichotomous branches, whereas in monopodial branches it was in the range of 0. 1 – 0. 3. Similar to previous studies, this study reveals that the vasculature architecture is mostly monopodial for the marginal cord insertion and mostly dichotomous for the central insertion.

Expression of IDO 1 protein on the fetal side of the interface extended from almost exclusively sub-trophoblastic capillaries in first-trimester placenta to a nearly general presence on villous vascular endothelia at term, including also most bigger vessels such as villous arteries and veins of stem villi and vessels of the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate.</b> Umbilical cord vessels were generally negative for IDO 1 protein. In the fetal part of the placenta positivity for IDO 1 was restricted to vascular endothelium, which did not co-express HLA-DR. This finding paralleled detectability of IDO 1 mRNA in first trimester and term tissue and a high increase in the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio in chorionic villous tissue from first trimester to term placenta. Endothelial cells isolated from the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> of term placenta expressed IDO 1 mRNA in contrast to endothelial cells originating from human umbilical vein, iliac vein or aorta.

Quadruplicate ex vivo human <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> arterial rings were used in all studies. Series 1 and 2 examined {{the role of the}} K+ channel in sevoflurane-mediated vasodilation. Separate experiments examined whether tetraethylammonium, which blocks large conductance calcium activated K+ (KCa++) channels (Series 1 A+B) or glibenclamide, which blocks the ATP sensitive K+ (KATP) channel (Series 2), modulated sevoflurane-mediated vasodilation. Series 3 - 5 examined the role of the Ca++ channel in sevoflurane induced vasodilation. Separate experiments examined whether verapamil, which blocks the sarcolemmal voltage-operated Ca++ channel (Series 3), SK&F 96365 an inhibitor of sarcolemmal voltage-independent Ca++ channels (Series 4 A+B), or ryanodine an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca++ channel (Series 5 A+B), modulated sevoflurane-mediated vasodilation. Sevoflurane produced dose dependent vasodilatation of <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> arterial rings in all studies. Prior blockade of the KCa++ and KATP channels augmented the vasodilator effects of sevoflurane. Furthermore, exposure of rings to sevoflurane in advance of TEA occluded the effects of TEA. Taken together, these findings suggest that sevoflurane blocks K+ channels. Blockade of the voltage-operated Ca++channels inhibited the vasodilator effects of sevoflurane. In contrast, blockade of the voltage-independent and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca++channels did not alter sevoflurane vasodilation. Sevoflurane appears to block chorionic arterial KCa++ and KATP channels. Sevoflurane also blocks voltage-operated calcium channels, and exerts a net vasodilatory effect in the in vitro foeto-placental circulation...|$|E

Separate experiments examined whether tetraethylammonium, which blocks large conductance calcium activated K + (K Ca++) channels (Series 1 A+B) or glibenclamide, which blocks the ATP sensitive K + (K ATP) channel (Series 2), modulated sevoflurane-mediated vasodilation. Series 3 – 5 examined the role of the Ca ++ channel in sevoflurane induced vasodilation. Separate experiments examined whether verapamil, which blocks the sarcolemmal voltage-operated Ca ++ channel (Series 3), SK&F 96365 an inhibitor of sarcolemmal voltage-independent Ca ++ channels (Series 4 A+B), or ryanodine an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca ++ channel (Series 5 A+B), modulated sevoflurane-mediated vasodilation. Results Sevoflurane produced dose dependent vasodilatation of <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> arterial rings in all studies. Prior blockade of the K Ca++ and K ATP channels augmented the vasodilator effects of sevoflurane. Furthermore, exposure of rings to sevoflurane in advance of TEA occluded the effects of TEA. Taken together, these findings suggest that sevoflurane blocks K + channels. Blockade of the voltage-operated Ca ++ channels inhibited the vasodilator effects of sevoflurane. In contrast, blockade of the voltage-independent and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca ++ channels did not alter sevoflurane vasodilation. Conclusion Sevoflurane appears to block chorionic arterial K Ca++ and K ATP channels. Sevoflurane also blocks voltage-operated calcium channels, and exerts a net vasodilatory effect in the in vitro foeto-placental circulation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Weight at {{delivery}} {{is a standard}} cumulative measure of placental growth. But weight is a crude summary of other placental characteristics, such as {{the size and shape}} of the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> and the location of the umbilical cord insertion. Distributions of such measures across a cohort reveal information about the developmental history of the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> that is unavailable from an analysis based solely on the mean and standard deviation. Various measures were determined from digitized images of chorionic plates obtained from the Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition Study, a prospective cohort study of preterm birth in central North Carolina between 2002 and 2004. The centroids (the geometric centers) and umbilical cord insertions were taken directly from the images. The <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> outlines were obtained from an interpolation based on a Fourier series, while eccentricity (of the best-fit ellipse), skewness, and kurtosis were determined from a shape analysis using the method of moments. The distribution of each variable was compared against the normal, lognormal, and Levy distributions. We found only a single measure (eccentricity) with a normal distribution. All other placental measures required lognormal or "heavy-tailed" distributions to account for moderate to extreme deviations from the mean, where relative likelihoods in the cohort far exceeded those of a normal distribution. Normal and lognormal distributions result from the accumulated effects of a large number of independent additive (normal) or multiplicative (lognormal) events. Thus, while most placentas appear to develop by a series of small, regular, and independent steps, the presence of heavy-tailed distributions suggests that many show shape features which are more consistent with a large number of correlated steps or fewer, but substantially larger, independent steps.

40|$|The syndecan family {{consists}} of four distinct membrane glycoproteins in mammals. Syndecans control cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion and migration through participation in cell-cell interactions, anchorage of cells to the extracellular environment, and modulation of multiple growth factors. Therefore, syndecans may play {{a pivotal role in}} the regulation of cell behaviour depending on the cellular microenvironment. Here, we demonstrate that syndecan- 1, syndecan- 2 and syndecan- 4 are expressed in fetal membrane tissue with different immunolocalizations. Syndecan- 1 is expressed in the amniotic epithelium, localizing at basolateral cell surfaces. Syndecan- 2 and syndecan- 4, in contrast, are mostly localized in intracellular compartments, in the extravillous cytotrophoblastic cells and in some fibroblasts of the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> {{as well as in the}} amniotic epithelial cells. In the latter, syndecan- 4 is mainly localized in the apical part of the cells. Our results strongly suggest a key role of syndecan- 1, syndecan- 2 and syndecan- 4 in the determination of structural and functional characteristics of human amnion and <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate.</b> Since the solute exchanges between fetus and mother take place in fetal membranes, our data suggest that syndecans are important players in the placenta for the establishment of the fetalmaternal inter-communication...|$|E
40|$|The {{networks}} of veins and arteries on the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> {{of the human}} placenta are analyzed in terms of Voronoi cells derived from these networks. Two groups of placentas from the United States are studied: a population cohort with no prescreening, and a cohort from newborns with an elevated risk of developing autistic spectrum disorder. Scaled distributions of the Voronoi cell areas in the two cohorts collapse onto a single distribution, indicating common mechanisms {{for the formation of}} the complete vasculatures, but which have different levels of activity in the two cohorts...|$|E
30|$|The US {{diagnostic}} {{performance for}} the diagnosis of abruption is low [49, 50]; in fact 25 – 50  % of haematomas, mostly retroplacental, remain undetected [51 – 53] because the echotexture of recent haemorrhage {{is similar to that}} of the placenta [49] or because of the small dimensions; moreover clots resulting from chronic abruption may drain through the cervix [53]. The most accurate ultrasound criteria for placenta abruption (sensitivity 80  %, specificity 92  %) are the detection of pre-/retroplacental collections, evidence of marginal subchorionic or intra-amniotic haematomas, increased placental thickness (> 5  cm) and jelly-like movements of the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> [51, 53].|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} {{for the taking}} and {{embedding}} of placental blocks to obtain maximum information regarding the uteroplacental vasculature was developed. This method involves taking en face blocks of the basal plate of the placenta. Results show that normal and abnormal maternal vessels are clearly delineated. In addition to conventional full thickness blocks, which provide information about the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> such as inflammation and meconium pigment uptake, and about the parenchyma in the other zones remote from the basal plate of the placenta, {{it is recommended that}} en face blocks be taken for histological assessment of the placenta...|$|E
40|$|Membrane {{angiotensin}} II receptors {{were measured}} in human placenta {{by means of}} 125 I [Sar 1 Ile 8] All (angiotensin II antagonist) and characterized by using 2 other antagonists of angiotensin II: Dup 753 and CGP 42112 A. These are specific and selective ligands which enable identification of AT 1 and AT 2 receptor subtypes respectively. The [Sar 1 Ile 8] All affinity is similar (Kd approximately 1 nmol. l- 1) in the 3 different placental structures examined. However, the Bmax of villous tissues is approximately 9 times higher than that observed in <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> but remains near that found in basal plate. In the central area of the placenta, mean values of 125 I [Sar 1 Ile 8] All binding observed at a single concentration of 0. 15 nmol. l- 1 are 242 +/- 31 fmol/mg proteins in basal plate, 300 +/- 35 in villous tissues and 36 +/- 8 in <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate.</b> The umbilical vein and arteries respectively have 8. 8 +/- 4. 8 and 4. 0 +/- 1. 7 fmol/mg protein. The subtype analysis shows that only AT 1 receptor is present in placental tissues. The Bmax values {{as well as those}} obtained by the relative measurement performed at a fixed 125 I [Sar 1 Ile 8] All concentration of 0. 15 nmol. l- 1 indicate that the highest concentrations of angiotensin II receptors are found in placental villous tissues...|$|E
40|$|Maspin is a serine {{protease}} inhibitor involved in regulating human placental trophoblast cell migration. Maspin {{has not been}} studied in preeclampsia (PE) or relative to the maternal-fetal immunological relationship, both of which may involve altered trophoblast migration. We examined maspin expression in placentas from in vitro fertilization (IVF) and egg donor (ED) pregnancies with and without PE. Exclusive to the <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate,</b> the number of maspin-positive extravillous trophoblasts was significantly decreased in IVF-PE vs. IVF (p = 0. 005) and ED vs. IVF (p = 0. 013). These data suggest maspin expression {{may be influenced by}} PE and/or the immunological dynamics of pregnancy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Meconium stained {{amniotic fluid}} (MSAF) is common and {{associated}} with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Other consequences of meconium passage before birth are less well understood. Methods: We reviewed the literature for original papers reporting on outcomes associated with MSAF. Findings: Among preterm infants MSAF is more prevalent than previously believed and {{is associated with}} higher neonatal morbidity. Intrauterine exposure to meconium is associated with inflammation of tissues of the lung, <b>chorionic</b> <b>plate</b> and umbilical vessels and through various mechanisms may contribute to neonatal morbidity, independent of MAS. No compelling evidence supported an association between MSAF and increased neurological impairment, including early seizure activity...|$|E
