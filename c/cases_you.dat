But {{this seems to}} overlook something significant: in both <b>cases,</b> <b>you</b> are still seeking to regulate when you have children. And so if one concludes that {{it is wrong to}} seek to regulate the timing and size of a family, then {{it would have to be}} concluded that natural family planning is just as wrong as [...] "artificial" [...] means. But if one concludes that it is appropriate to steward the timing and size of one's family, then what makes [...] "artificial" [...] means wrong but natural family planning right? Surely it is not because God is [...] "more free" [...] to overrule our plans with natural family planning! Perhaps some have concluded that artificial forms are wrong because they allow one more fully to separate intercourse from the possibility of procreation. But if it is wrong to have intercourse without a significant possibility of procreation, then it would also be wrong to have intercourse during pregnancy or after a woman is past her childbearing years. There is no reason to {{conclude that}} natural family planning is appropriate but that [...] "artificial" [...] means are not.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Ishiganto are talismanic stone tablets {{that are}} {{strategically}} placed in certain locations {{to ward off}} evil or unwanted spirits. They are almost always rectangle in shape with the writing inscribed vertically. [...] In rare <b>cases</b> <b>you</b> will see the rectangular stone placed horizontally along with the inscription as well. [...] The [...] origin derived from China where they were most commonly placed at four way intersections, T-intersections, and dead end roads. These spirits are believed to {{only be able to}} move in a straight line or along roads. Legend gives the original purpose of it was to keep out evil spirits since they supposedly were unable to negotiate the turn. (Steiner, 1947) [...] Houses positioned at the end of roads or corners of intersections will mostly likely have an ishiganto there in order to stop these spirits from walking straight into a house. Many houses will still have an ishiganto even if they are not located on a T-intersection or four-way intersection. [...] In Okinawa houses traditionally have a low wall surrounding the entire property approximately the height of a man’s chest to protect it from the prevalent typhoon winds and to give general security. The entrance to the house additionally had another small wall called a “himpun” to prevent people looking directly into the establishment. The break in the low wall to enter the property near the entrance to the house is where the ishiganto would traditionally be placed. (Takahashi & Matsui, 2011) ...|$|E

2500|$|In his 1958 article Tobin {{also led}} the way in showing how to deal with utility {{maximization}} under uncertainty with an infinite number of possible states. As Palda explains [...] "One {{way to get out of}} the mess of figuring out asset prices using a model of maximizing the expected utility of investing in stocks is to make assumptions about either preferences or the probabilities of the different possible states of the world. Nobellist James Tobin (1958) took this line and discovered that in some <b>cases</b> <b>you</b> do not need to worry about the utility of income in thousands of states, and the attached probabilities, to solve the consumer’s choice on how to spread income among states. When preferences contain only a linear and a squared term (a case of diminishing returns) or the probabilities of different stock returns follow a normal distribution (an equation that contains a linear and squared terms as parameters), a simple formulation of a person’s investment choices becomes possible. Under Tobin’s assumptions we can reformulate the person’s decision problem as being one of trading off risk and expected return. Risk, or more precisely the variance of your investment portfolio creates spread in the returns you expect. People are willing to assume more risk only if compensated by a higher level of expected return. One can thus think of a tradeoff people are willing to make between risk and expected return. They invest in risky assets to the point at which their willingness to trade off risk and return is equal to the rate at which they able to trade them off. It is difficult to exaggerate how brilliant is the simplification of the investment problem that flows from these assumptions. Instead of worrying about the investor’s optimization problem in potentially millions of possible states of the world, one need only worry about how the investor can trade off risk and return in the stock market." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{changes have}} been made in the {{prosecution}} and legal representation of indigent defendants since the Gideon decision. The decision created and then expanded the need for public defenders which had previously been rare. For example, immediately following the decision, Florida required public defenders in all of the state's circuit courts. The need for more public defenders also led to a need to ensure that they were properly trained in criminal defense in order to allow defendants to receive as fair a trial as possible. Several states and counties followed suit. [...] Washington D.C., for instance, has created a training program for their public defenders, who must receive rigorous training before they are allowed to represent defendants, and must continue their training in order to remain current in criminal law, procedure, and practices. In 2010, a public defender's office in the South Bronx, The Bronx Defenders, created the Center for Holistic Defense, which has helped other public defender offices, from Montana to Massachusetts, developed a model of public defense called holistic defense or holistic advocacy. In it, criminal defense attorneys work on interdisciplinary teams, alongside civil attorneys, social workers, and legal advocates to help clients with not only direct but also collateral aspects of their criminal cases. More recently the American Bar Association and the National Legal Aid and Defender Association have set minimum training requirements, caseload levels, and experience requirements for defenders. There is often controversy whether case loads set upon public defenders give them enough time to sufficiently defend their clients. [...] Some criticize the mindset in which public defense lawyers encourage their clients to simply plead guilty. Some defenders say this is intended to lessen their own work load, while others would say it is intended to obtain a lighter sentence by negotiating a plea bargain as compared with going to trial and perhaps having a harsher sentence imposed. [...] Tanya Greene, an ACLU lawyer, has said that is why 90 to 95 percent of defendants do plead guilty: [...] "You've got so many cases, limited resources, and there's no relief. You go to work, you get more <b>cases.</b> <b>You</b> have to triage." ...|$|E
