25|$|The {{common emitter}} (or common source, common cathode, etc.) {{is most often}} {{configured}} to provide amplification of a voltage applied between base and emitter, and the output signal taken between collector and emitter is inverted, relative to the input. The common collector arrangement applies the input voltage between base and collector, and to take the output voltage between emitter and collector. This causes negative feedback, and the output voltage tends to follow the input voltage. This arrangement is also used as the input presents a high impedance and does not load the signal source, though the voltage amplification is less than one. The common-collector circuit is, therefore, better known as an emitter follower, source follower, or <b>cathode</b> <b>follower.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vacuum Tube Voltmeters or valve {{voltmeters}} (VTVM, VVM) {{were used}} for voltage measurements in electronic circuits where high input impedance was necessary. The VTVM had a fixed input impedance of typically 1megohm or more, usually through use of a <b>cathode</b> <b>follower</b> input circuit, and thus did not significantly load the circuit being tested. VTVMs were used before the introduction of electronic high-impedance analog transistor and field effect transistor voltmeters (FETVOMs). Modern digital meters (DVMs) and some modern analog meters also use electronic input circuitry to achieve high input impedance—their voltage ranges are functionally equivalent to VTVMs. The input impedance of some poorly-designed DVMs (especially some early designs) would vary {{over the course of}} a sample-and-hold internal measurement cycle, causing disturbances to some sensitive circuits under test.|$|E
5000|$|High {{efficiency}} Class B+ push-pull amplifiers {{operate at}} higher bias points (near zero or even positive values). These designs {{take care of}} grid currents {{through the use of}} <b>cathode</b> <b>followers</b> or interstage transformers easing current load on the driver stages, and deep negative feedback to minimize distortion.|$|R
50|$|Circlotrons, unlike minimalistic {{single-ended}} amplifiers, need {{to employ}} quite complex balanced input and driver stages delivering at least 100V peak-to-peak voltage {{and able to}} drive relatively high capacitance loads (due {{to the number of}} paralleled power triodes and associated long wiring). The first requirement is typically solved with a long-tailed cascode stage (2 or 3 double triodes), the second - with two <b>cathode</b> <b>followers</b> inserted between the driver stage and the power stage. Both need a bipolar power supply, independent of the power stage power supplies, with power established before the power stage supply starts.|$|R
40|$|It was {{reported}} by Brindley (1, 3, 5) {{that there is a}} layer of high electrical resistance and capacitance termed the R membrane in the retina and that the ERG develops across this membrane. He considers that the R membrane is the external limiting membrane. On the other hand, Brown and Wiesel (6) who worked more recently on the unopened cat's eye with microelectrodes concluded that the P, membrane is not the external limiting membrane but Bruch's membrane lying just back of the pigment epithelium. It will be reported in this paper that (a) our results obtained from the excised opened eye of the frog support the conclusion of Brown and Wiesel, (b) the R membrane is an important physical factor that determines the configuration of the intraretinally recorded action potential, and (c) some of the conflicting evidence concerning the origin of the ERG obtained with microelectrodes can be resolved in terms of this factor. METHOD The localization of the R membrane was made by measuring the radial resistance of the frog's opened eye using a modification of Brindley's method. The arrangement used is illustrated in Fig. IA. Constant current pulses 15 /za. in intensity and some 35 msec. in duration were passed across the eye from a wick-electrode in contact with the vitreous humor to a chlorided silver plate which also served as the indifferent lead. The eye was mounted in the concave upper face of a block of Ringer-soaked chalk placed on the silver plate. This arrangement served to produce a radial current of constant density across the eye. Potentials developed by the pulse currents across the tissue were led off by the internal and external pipettes of a pencil-type microelectrode (10, 11, 13). Silver wires inserted into each pipette were connected through <b>cathode</b> <b>followers</b> to a two channel amplifier as shown in Fig. 1 A. By connecting the two pipettes differentially to one of the channels (channel I) of the amplifier...|$|R

50|$|The White <b>Cathode</b> <b>Follower</b> (Patent 2,358,428, Sep 1944 by E. L. C. White) {{is similar}} to the SEPP design above, but the signal input is to the top tube, acting as a <b>cathode</b> <b>follower,</b> but one where the bottom tube (in common cathode configuration) if fed (usually via a step-up transformer) from the current in the plate (anode) of the top device. It {{essentially}} reverses the roles of the two devices in SEPP. The bottom tube acts part way between a constant current sink and an equal partner in the push-pull workload. Again, the drive to each tube therefore might not be equal.|$|E

5000|$|Otto Herbert Schmitt (April 6, 1913 [...] - [...] January 6, 1998) was an American inventor, engineer, and biophysicist {{known for}} his {{scientific}} contributions to biophysics and for establishing the field of biomedical engineering.

50|$|Increased {{impedance}} {{is implemented}} by a non-inverting amplifier with gain of 0 < Av < 1. The (magnitude of) output voltage {{is less than}} the input voltage Vi and partially neutralizes it. Examples are imperfect voltage followers (emitter, source, <b>cathode</b> <b>follower,</b> etc.) and amplifiers with series negative feedback (emitter degeneration), whose input impedance is moderately increased.|$|E
50|$|In this circuit {{the base}} {{terminal}} of the transistor {{serves as the}} input, the emitter is the output, and the collector is common to both (for example, it may be tied to ground reference or a power supply rail), hence its name. The analogous field-effect transistor circuit is the common drain amplifier and the analogous tube circuit is the <b>cathode</b> <b>follower.</b>|$|E
50|$|In a <b>cathode</b> <b>follower</b> or common-plate configuration, {{the output}} {{is taken from}} the cathode resistance. Because of {{negative}} feedback (the cathode-ground voltage cancels the grid-ground voltage) the voltage gain is close to unity and the output voltage follows the grid voltage. Although the cathode resistor can be many kilohms (depending on biasing requirements), the small-signal output impedance is very low (see operational amplifier).|$|E
50|$|The Triple-twin was a type {{of double}} vacuum triode for audio power amplifiers. A triple-twin {{contained}} two dissimilar, directly coupled triodes in a common envelope. To maximize power yield, the output triode {{was intended to be}} positively biased, and thus required substantial grid current. This current was supplied by the input triode, configured as a <b>cathode</b> <b>follower.</b> The cathode of the input triode was hard-wired to the control grid of the output triode inside the envelope.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum tube {{push-pull}} amplifiers usually use an output transformer, although Output-transformerless (OTL) tube stages exist (such as the SEPP/SRPP and the White <b>Cathode</b> <b>Follower</b> below). The phase-splitter {{stage is}} usually another vacuum tube but a transformer with a center-tapped secondary winding was occasionally {{used in some}} designs. Because these are essentially square-law devices, the comments regarding distortion cancellation mentioned above apply to most push-pull tube designs when operated in class A (i.e. neither device is driven to its non-conducting state).|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} type 295 had a directly heated output section, and an indirectly heated input section. The 2B6 tube, {{introduced in}} 1933, had similar power ratings, but had both cathodes indirectly heated. The Sylvania 6N6G, introduced in 1936, had both cathodes indirectly heated, and {{also had the}} <b>cathode</b> <b>follower</b> resistor hard-wired inside the envelope. A single-ended 6N6G amplifier required only one external component, the output transformer; currents and bias voltages were set by the internal resistor. A push-pull 6N6G amplifier required only two tubes and two transformers (input and output).|$|E
50|$|Other {{unity gain}} buffer {{amplifiers}} include the {{bipolar junction transistor}} in common-collector configuration (called an emitter follower because the emitter voltage follows the base voltage, or a voltage follower because the output voltage follows the input voltage); the field effect transistor in common-drain configuration (called a source follower because the source voltage follows the gate voltage or, again, a voltage follower because the output voltage follows the input voltage); or similar configurations using vacuum tubes (<b>cathode</b> <b>follower),</b> or other active devices. All such amplifiers actually have a gain of slightly less than unity, but the difference is usually small and unimportant.|$|E
5000|$|The Hartley {{oscillator}} {{is distinguished}} by a tank circuit {{consisting of two}} series-connected coils (or, often, a tapped coil) in parallel with a capacitor, with an amplifier between the relatively high impedance across the entire LC tank and the relatively low voltage/high current point between the coils. The original 1915 version used a triode as the amplifying device in common plate (<b>cathode</b> <b>follower)</b> configuration, with three batteries, and separate adjustable coils. The simplified circuit shown to the right uses a JFET (in common-drain configuration), an LC tank circuit (here the single winding is tapped) and a single battery. The circuit illustrates the Hartley oscillator operation: ...|$|E
50|$|Active scope probes use a {{high-impedance}} high-frequency amplifier {{mounted in}} the probe head, and a screened lead. The purpose of the amplifier is not gain, but isolation (buffering) between the circuit under test and the oscilloscope and cable, loading the circuit with only a low capacitance and high DC resistance, and matching the oscilloscope input. Active probes are commonly seen by the circuit under test as a capacitance of 1 picofarad or less in parallel with 1 megohm resistance. Probes {{are connected to the}} oscilloscope with a cable matching the characteristic impedance of the oscilloscope input. Tube based active probes were used before the advent of high-frequency solid-state electronics, using a small vacuum tube as <b>cathode</b> <b>follower</b> amplifier.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{equipment}} needed to record single units is microelectrodes, amplifiers, micromanipulators and recording devices. The type of microelectrode used {{will depend on}} the application. The high resistance of these electrodes creates a problem during signal amplification. If it were connected to a conventional amplifier with low input resistance, there would be a large potential drop across the microelectrode and the amplifier would only measure {{a small portion of the}} true potential. To solve this problem, a <b>cathode</b> <b>follower</b> amplifier must be used as an impedance matching device to collect the voltage and feed it to a conventional amplifier. To record from a single neuron, micromanipulators must be used to precisely insert an electrode into the brain. This is especially important for intracellular single-unit recording.|$|E

5000|$|Dumble {{also made}} a tube-buffered {{external}} effects loop called a Dumbleator. A few Dumble amps have a Dumbleator circuit built into them, but most have [...] "un-buffered" [...] input jacks that tap directly out of the pre-amp and into the power amp. This external loop was likely created {{because of the difficulty}} of fitting effects loop buffering into the chassis of the amplifier (and the limited use that effects loops serve for most players). The Dumbleator has separate [...] "Send" [...] and [...] "Receive" [...] controls for the effects, and a [...] "Bright Switch" [...] on at least the return. Later models also have the bright switch on the send. There are also stereo versions available. This effects loop buffering is essentially a <b>cathode</b> <b>follower</b> for the send, into a gain stage for return.|$|E
50|$|A Single Ended Push-Pull (SEPP, SRPP or mu-follower) output stage, {{originally}} {{called the}} Series-Balanced amplifier (US patent 2,310,342, Feb 1943). {{is similar to}} a totem-pole arrangement for transistors in that two devices are in series between the power supply rails, but the input drive goes only to one of the devices, the bottom one of the pair; hence the (seemingly contradictory) Single-Ended description. The output is taken from the cathode of the top (not directly driven) device, which acts part way between a constant current source and a <b>cathode</b> <b>follower</b> but receiving some drive from the plate (anode) circuit of the bottom device. The drive to each tube therefore might not be equal, but the circuit tends to keep the current through the bottom device somewhat constant throughout the signal, increasing the power gain and reducing distortion compared with a true single-tube single-ended output stage.|$|E
5000|$|Glass micropipettes {{are filled}} with an ionic {{solution}} to make them conductive; a silver-silver chloride (Ag-AgCl) electrode is dipped into the filling solution as an electrical terminal. Ideally, the ionic solutions should have ions similar to ionic species around the electrode; the concentration inside the electrode and surrounding fluid should be the same. Additionally, the diffusive characteristics of the different ions within the electrode should be similar. The ion must {{also be able to}} [...] "provide current carrying capacity adequate for the needs of the experiment". And importantly, it must not cause biological changes in the cell it is recording from. Ag-AgCl electrodes are primarily used with a potassium chloride (KCl) solution. With Ag-AgCl electrodes, ions react with it to produce electrical gradients at the interface, creating a voltage change with respect to time. Electrically, glass microelectrode tips have high resistance and high capacitance. They have a tip size of approximately 0.5-1.5 µm with a resistance of about 10-50 MΩ. The small tips make it easy to penetrate the cell membrane with minimal damage for intracellular recordings. Micropipettes are ideal for measurement of resting membrane potentials and with some adjustments can record action potentials. There are some issues to consider when using glass micropipettes. To offset high resistance in glass micropipettes, a <b>cathode</b> <b>follower</b> must be used as the first-stage amplifier. Additionally, high capacitance develops across the glass and conducting solution which can attenuate high-frequency responses. There is also electrical interference inherent in these electrodes and amplifiers.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the investigation carried {{out of the}} radio noise emitted by the planet Jupiter on 18 Mc/s and 22 Mc/s. Chapter I gives a brief introduction and outlines radioastronomical as well as astronomical ideas concerning Jupiter. A detailed survey of the research done to date {{including some of the}} hypotheses formulated by previous workers is presented in Chapter II. Chapter III deals with the apparatus used in this research. Two similar sets of apparatus were used. The aerials were folded dipoles. The signals were fed to the receiver, an R 206, via a 300 ohm impedance line. To increase the gain an extra I -F. stage was included. This gave a gain of better than a 120 dB. To match the signals into the recorder a <b>cathode</b> <b>follower</b> was used. The operating procedure appears in the fourth chapter.

40|$|The device {{described}} is a preasure-sensitive transducer. {{commercially available}} condenser microphone, a Stephens model C- 1 {{was used as}} a capacitor manometer. The instrument was developed for use in breath velocity studies where pressures encountered are thousandths of pounds per square inch. A study of the literature indicated that a number of methods have been used to obtain information breath velocity studies of which the capacitor manometer {{is one of the most}} promising. Its use makes possible high sensitivity and short rise-time which is important in providing useful information in respiratory studies. The method employed is based on the um of the microphone as a variable load impedance in a <b>cathode</b> <b>follower</b> driven by a crystal controlled oscillators The voltage impressed across the microphone in the range of 8 is then detected and emplified. A dummy channel, an electrical equivalent of the microphone and its cable, is used in a balancing arrangement to develop a variable d-e centering voltage for the pen recorder used with this instrument and to provide the means for an output balanced to ground. A voltage-regulator power-supply is used to assist in attaining high useful sensitivity by reducing drift and ripple attibutable the power supply.

40|$|Potential {{measurements}} {{as negative}} as [...] 1. 67 EHO volts in 1 N KC 1 solution pH 3. 2, have been {{measured on a}} freshly cut aluminum surface by a technique devised by Hagyard and co-workers (1, 2). A poly-thene-coated aluminum rod immersed in 1 N KC 1 solu-tion was cut by a ruby travell ing at 1000 cm/sec. Po-tential measurements were made using a high- im-pedance <b>cathode</b> <b>follower</b> coupled to an oscilloscope. From the instant the cut was made into the aluminum, its potential was recorded by photographing a single traverse of the oscilloscope trace. A typical potential measurement is shown in Fig. 1. The initial rapid potential rise to the peak was at-tributed to the dissolution of aluminum charging the double layer. After reaching the peak potential, {{only a small fraction}} of the electrode surface was thought to remain actively anodic whi le the slower hydrogen discharge process took place over most of the metal surface. The exponential fall in potential was at-tr ibuted to the polarization of the anodic and cathodic processes. The information gained using this tech-nique enabled the kinetics for aluminum dissolution and hydrogen discharge on aluminum to be studied. The object of the present work was to confirm the validity of the measurements made by the above technique. The possible alternative explanations of the potential behavior of freshly cut aluminum that were considered by the authors were (a) that in-stantaneous high temperatures were generated at the cut surface by the shearing action of the ruby cutter; the high temperatures would be rapidly reduced by heat dissipation into the bulk of the metal, (b) severe stressing and dislocation of the aluminum elec-trode surface followed by relaxation of the surface structure; the peak in this case would be a stress po-tential.

40|$|The {{apparatus}} to be {{used for}} the C 136 experiments is being extensively modified so that better vacuums may be attained. At the same time, the necessary high resolution of the mass spectrometer is being sought. The failure to obtain the desired resolution is probably traceable to two effects: stray electrostatic fields, and defocusing of the beam by the numerous electrons that accompany the negative ions. Attempts are being made to eliminate both of these effects. Tests show that the concentration of C 136, originally 1 in 5000 with respect to the stable isotopes, can be increased to 1 in 150 by a Szilard-Chalmers reaction. The amount of material available, as well as radioactive hazards, makes it necessary to recirculate the gas by successive trapping with liquid nitrogen. Battery power supplies have been replaced by carefully regulated ac-operated supplies, wherever possible, to avoid failure {{in the middle of a}} run. The ac-operated supplies appear entirely satisfactory. Rotating coil magnetometers are to be installed in all transition fields to allow rapid adjustment, thus eliminating the loss of time (some-times ruinous in experiments on radioactive materials) entailed in finding a transition and "chasing " it up or down with varying field. The apparatus program has been con-cluded with some electrometer developments that are described below. The electrometer tube and galvanometer combination hitherto used to measure ion beam currents had an over-all sensitivity of approximately 10 - 16 amp/mm with a time constant of approximately 8 sec. By using cathode followers to remove the mismatch between the high resistance plate circuit of the electrometer (50 K) and the galvanometer, an additional gain of 100 can be realized. Introducing a highpass filter with an insertion loss of 3 allows the time constant to be reduced to 4 sec, except on the most sensitive range when the Ayrton shunt allows the low impedance output of the <b>cathode</b> <b>follower</b> to shunt the galvanometer, thus increasing the time constant to 10 sec. The improvement in performance can be seen from the table below. Sensitivity Time constant Approximate Shunt loss (amp/mm) (sec) noise (mm...|$|E
