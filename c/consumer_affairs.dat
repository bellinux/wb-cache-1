One such star-naming company is the International Star Registry, which, during the 1980s, was accused of deceptive practice for making it appear that the assigned name was official. This now-discontinued ISR practice was informally labeled a scam and a fraud, and the New York City Department of <b>Consumer</b> <b>Affairs</b> issued a violation against ISR for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.|$|E
