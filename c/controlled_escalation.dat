This book-length project analyzes how secrecy is used in international affairs and why states so often resort to its use. Extant scholarship suggests states use secrecy in security competition to surprise adversaries or insulate domestically vulnerable leaders from dovish constituents. My project develops an alternative logic rooted in <b>controlling</b> conflict <b>escalation</b> risks. I focus on military interventions by outside powers and argue intervening states choose covert methods when the local conflict has high potential for hard-to-control escalation. By intervening secretly and without official acknowledgement, intervening states harness {{the political power of}} ignorance and ambiguity, circumventing several pathways that make escalation by leaders on both sides hard to resist. If done successfully, covertness makes retaliation by other states less likely; restraint and withdrawal by the intervening state is also easier. This escalation-based motive also makes sense of puzzling forms of “tacit collusion, ” i. e. when third party states and adversaries join in concealing an intervention.

At the other extreme, when the buyer uses a reverse English auction with no reserve price due to her lack of bargaining power, she may consider protecting herself against potential price escalation from cost-advantaged suppliers by using a less diversified supply base.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the utility of}} non-lethal weapons for mitigating risks in demanding tactical scenarios, specifically crowd control. Noncombatant evacuation operations (NEOs) are conducted when a host government becomes unstable. A NEO force's failure to manage the potential for local violence against the mission can lead to negative consequences for U. S. foreign policy and international relations. Therefore, the NEO force must <b>control</b> any <b>escalation</b> in the threat level because mission success could be jeopardized. Along with restrictive rules of engagement these considerations discourage the use of deadly force. Thus, non-lethal weapons {{have a role in}} NEOs. One of the challenges in NEOs is crowd control. Crowds have the potential for violence. Left unchecked, they can endanger the NEO mission. This thesis finds that a non- lethal capability is essential for responding to these threats. The thesis' methodology produces a short list of suitable non-lethal crowd control weapons for deployment in NEOs. Finally, the arguments for non-lethality in NEOs can be extended to other operations other than war, thus increasing the utility of non- lethal weapons in the U. S. military inventory. U. S.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of {{charged particle}} radiotherapy (CPT) in many countries will require British oncologists to establish their personal viewpoints on this subject in order to advise their patients regarding the merits or otherwise of obtaining such treatment abroad. This paper covers the advantages and some disadvantages of CPT in many anatomical locations {{on the basis of}} the achievable dose distributions as a consequence of the Bragg peak effect. The advantages in terms of normal tissue effects should follow the reduction of tissue volumes exposed to low/moderate dose: significant reductions in acute tissue effects are expected and experienced. For late reacting tissues, the predicted benefits are in the reduction of chronic low-grade symptoms and so improving the quality of life. For tumour <b>control,</b> dose <b>escalation</b> beyond what is achievable with X-ray therapy is possible only for some tumour types. Also, some tumours not presently treated by X-rays can be treated by CPT instead of radical surgery. Many of the available publications about CPT are at 'proof of principle' stage, as the treatment technique continues to be optimised: this is a similar situation to mega-voltage radiotherapy around 50 years ago.

The investigated compounds show that the main pharmacological focus in this area has shifted from psychosis to improvement of individual negative or cognitive symptom complexes, from direct receptor inhibition to indirect receptor modulation, and from single drug strategies to combination therapies, each targeted at different symptoms. We have tried to create a pharmacological fingerprint of the investigated compounds by making use of an intensive CNS test battery to measure effects in different functional domains of the brain and additional ‘tools’ (i. e. positive <b>controls,</b> dose <b>escalation,</b> PK-PD modeling and pharmacological challenge tests) to improve the reliability of the tests.

40|$|Scholars of widely {{diverging}} persuasions {{have recognized}} {{the implications of the}} world constellation in which the discourse on foreign intervention with all its manifestations in a civil war has an explanatory value. How-ever, a number of long-standing theoretical, methodological and epistemological challenges still resist clearcut solution. This study analyzes the roles of the great powers and the OAU in the Nigerian civil war with the empirical ambition of identifying central tendencies relevant to this case. Badom submits that periodization can serve an analytical purpose. Thus, the author treats as a unity the dynamics of great power politics in the period 1967 - 1970. A period that spans the so-called limited detente. In these years, the Sino-Soviet rivalry increased and led to a split of the al-lian [...] ce of the 1950 s. These years witnessed a change in leadership in Mos-cow, Peking and in Washington. These years witnessed the opening of the American-Chinese relations, the Cultural Revolution in China, the Israeli airstrike on Egyptian and other Arab airbases, the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the importance of both China and Soviet Union to the US, the series of military take-overs in Africa, the crackdown on the IRA, and above all, the internal and international revulsion against the horrors of the war in Vietnam {{in the aftermath of the}} assassinations of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. King. All over Western Europe, there were deep sources of discontent which overlapped and fused, urban squalor and overcrowded schools and universities but in France, it was bad enough to inflame a generation which had been attuned to political activism by the Algerian war. It led to the students uprising. These cases were not isolated. Thus, the author argues that the observed pattern of involvement in the Nigerian civil war finds its explanation in the very dynamics of great power politics suggesting that the distribution of power determines who is whose friend and whose enemy at a given time. Badom argues that what constitutes intervention during an ongoing civil war might not even register as intervention otherwise in the light of global interdependence. Consequently, the study contributes to both our theoretical and empirical understandings of intervention as a compound phenomenon central to the study of international relations in a given context. The author argues that despite the fears whether Nigeria would be transformed into an arena for the Sino-Soviet conflict, the superpowers hegemonic rivalry between Washington and Moscow, the colonial competition between France and Britain over their former colonies, and the apprehensions as to whether the balkanization of Nigeria would be achieved through foreign intervention, the war did not escalate as feared. The rea-sons, he argues that the controlling mechanisms of great power politics, the recognition of the risks and limits of the war, the active role of the OAU and Prime Minster Harold Wilson’s diplomacy in sum, helped to <b>control</b> <b>escalation.</b> The conclusion serves as a step for further research...|$|R

Precise {{localization}} {{of moving}} {{targets in the}} thorax and abdomen {{during the course of}} treatment can be used to increase local <b>control</b> via dose <b>escalation</b> while reducing the severity of normal tissue complication. Localization of targets in real time with radio-opaque marker is not practical considering the excess radiation dose to the patient and potential complications of implantation. Various external surrogates can be used to give indications of locations of the targets during the breathing process. However, {{there is a great deal}} of uncertainty in correlation between external surrogates and internal target positions/trajectory during respiratory cycles. This is due to the fact that the correlation tends to vary through time as the patient’s breathing pattern changes. In this paper, we address the problem of establishing the correlation between a surrogate signal and an internal target prior to treatment. We have developed an algorithm that automatically establishes correspondences between the fluoroscopic sequence frames taken from the patient on the da...|$|R
