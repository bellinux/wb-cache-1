5|$|Favoured {{soils are}} deep grey sandy loams or {{shallower}} sand overlying <b>claypan.</b> Associated vegetation is typically scrubland or shrubland, although moisture-loving trees such as B.littoralis (Swamp Banksia) or Melaleuca preissiana (Moonah) {{may also be}} present, sometimes in sufficient numbers to form a low open woodland.|$|E
50|$|The Ewaninga Conservation Reserve {{is an area}} of low sand dunes, rocky {{outcrops}} and a <b>claypan</b> about 35 km {{south of}} Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia. The site was gazetted on 20 November 1996.The <b>claypan</b> is a slightly concave surface approximately 100m across. It retains water after even light rain, thus attracting many birds and animals. The <b>claypan</b> and surrounding outcrops are also a significant archaeological site.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Claypans</b> provide {{homes to}} a variety of flora and fauna. One such species is the Dawson's Burrowing Bee, located in Australia. This species uses <b>claypans</b> as the sites for their {{underground}} nests, where individuals will they lay their broods post-mating.|$|R
50|$|The {{habitat of}} the Australian {{pratincole}} is treeless, open and sparse wooded plains, grasslands, <b>claypans</b> and gibberstone. Most {{of these areas}} are usually in arid and semi-arid rainfall zones. They are also sometimes found around the margins of wetlands, creeks, river beds, bore drains, lagoons, springs, <b>claypans</b> and sewage farms. During the breeding season they need scattered low shrubland as the chicks use the shrubs to hide and shelter in.|$|R

50|$|In {{consideration}} {{of both the}} Aboriginal culture and the ideals of conservation of the area, visitors may only explore in the designated viewing and camping areas on the southwest side of the <b>claypan,</b> and along the trail to Mushroom Rock or other officially marked trails. All other areas, including the <b>claypan,</b> are restricted access requiring a guide.|$|E
50|$|Cuddie Springs is {{a notable}} archaeological and paleontological {{site in the}} {{semi-arid}} zone of central northern New South Wales, Australia (near Brewarrina). Cuddie Springs is an open site, with the fossil deposits preserved in a <b>claypan</b> {{on the floor of}} an ancient ephemeral lake. The <b>claypan</b> fills with water after local rainstorms and often takes months to dry, a fact which facilitated the survival of fossils {{over a long period of}} time.|$|E

5000|$|The Rainbow Valley {{access road}} is located 75 km south of Alice Springs as a branch off the Stuart Highway. The {{unsealed}} dirt access road heads east then southeast for 22 km to {{a parking lot}} situated {{on the west side}} of a <b>claypan</b> that extends northwest from the base of the main sandstone formation. Since there are some sandy sections along the access road, the official park site declares the road as [...] "recommended for 4WD vehicles only." [...] The joint management plan's official document, however, refers to the access road as [...] "suitable for conventional vehicles driven with care" [...] but still recommends 4WD for the final 1.4 km around the <b>claypan.</b> A plan to re-align and improve the final section was in place as of June 2008.|$|E
5000|$|We {{commenced}} our excavations about 10 {{yards from}} the well, working towards the centre, and before work was stopped, about five weeks later, the <b>claypan</b> resembled the fields of Flanders, with a complicated series of trenches and pits, mostly about 5 feet in depth, but in one case about 15 feet.|$|E
50|$|The {{headwaters}} of the Edmund rise north of the Barlee Range. The river flows south-west joined by the Dundagee, Edmund <b>Claypan,</b> Bobbamindagee, Rock Hole, Dingo and Donald Creeks until it forms its confluence with the Lyons River. The Lyons continues until it flows into the Gascoyne River. The river descends 130 m over its 85 km course.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} in the lakebed and <b>claypans</b> {{is mostly}} shrubland with {{species such as}} samphire and lignum dominating, and low open woodland of Eucalyptus camaldulensis in the margins. The surrounding vegetation is taller open shrubland.|$|R

5000|$|Bilpa Morea is a <b>claypan</b> in the Shire of Diamantina in {{the extreme}} {{southwest}} of Queensland, Australia. It has been investigated as a possible location for land speed record attempts due to its flat and hard surface. [...] An archaeological dig in 2009 recovered artefacts buried by explorers Burke and Wills under the clay during their ill-fated 1861 expedition.|$|E
5000|$|In geology, a <b>claypan</b> is a dense, compact, slowly {{permeable}} {{layer in}} the subsoil having {{a much higher}} clay content than the overlying material, from which it is separated by a sharply defined boundary. Claypans are usually hard when dry, and plastic and sticky when wet. They limit or slow the downward movement of water through the soil.|$|E

50|$|Amegilla dawsoni, {{sometimes}} called the Dawson's burrowing bee is a species of bee that nests by the thousands in arid <b>claypans</b> in Western Australia. It is a long tongued bee, of the tribe Anthophorini and genus Amegilla, the second largest genus of the Anthophorini species.|$|R
50|$|Father O'Sullivan, {{the flying}} padre, {{was forced to}} land his Tiger Moth {{airplane}} on a <b>claypan</b> at Wooramel in 1956 after experiencing engine trouble and poor visibility. He was sighted later by the pilot of a MacRobertson Miller DC3 that had been diverted to search. O'Sullivan was later rescued by a search party that had to cut a road from Wooramel to the site.|$|E
50|$|The Drummond Nature Reserve is {{constructed}} {{with a series}} of lateritic hills with spillway deposits plus a small outcrop of bedrock. There have been ten different vegetation areas identified, and these are based on different soil types, topography and drainage. The area has six different woodland types, two granite heath types, a mallee vegetation type and two of the last <b>claypan</b> wetland areas remaining in the state.|$|E
50|$|HSG Group D (high runoff potential): Soils {{with very}} slow {{infiltration}} rates when thoroughly wetted. These consist chiefly of clay soils {{with a high}} swelling potential, soils with a permanent high water table, soils with a <b>claypan</b> or clay layer {{at or near the}} surface, and shallow soils over nearly impervious materials. These soils have a very slow rate of water transmission (final infiltration rate less than 0.05 in./h).|$|E
50|$|The area is {{composed}} of a mixture of landscapes including saltbush dominated clay pans, mulga country and grasslands. The stock can be watered at 34 different water points as well as numerous <b>claypans</b> and fresh water creeks. In 2013 Prenti Downs was carrying a herd of 4,000 shorthorn cattle.|$|R
5000|$|Melaleuca rigidifolia {{occurs in}} {{and between the}} Stirling Range, Albany, Lake Cronin and Esperance districts [...] in the Coolgardie, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions. It grows {{in a range of}} {{vegetation}} associations and soils on salty <b>claypans</b> and gravel pits and sometimes near railway lines.|$|R
50|$|The favoured {{habitat is}} the sparsely vegetated arid gibber plains and <b>claypans</b> of the Lake Eyre Basin, {{including}} parts of northern South Australia, far south-western Queensland {{and possibly the}} Northern Territory, though this last is uncertain. Records from the late 19th century show that its former range was more extensive including western New South Wales.|$|R
