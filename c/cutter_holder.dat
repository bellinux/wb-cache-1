40|$|The {{vibration}} {{acceleration time}} history of the <b>cutter</b> <b>holder</b> was separated into three parts; namely, chatter free, transition and chatter processes. The reconstructed attractor and probability distribution of vibration acceleration time series were studied in order to observe the system’s behavior. The Lyapunov exponent andKolmogorov entropy were used to help judge the cutting state. Meanwhile, the relation curves of the Lyapunov exponent and entropy versus machining parameters were plotted and discussed. The research shows that Lyapunov exponent and Kolmogorov entropy are toned up when vibration acceleration time his- tory goes from chatter free, transition to chatter. When cutting state transited from chatter free to chatter, the Lyapunov exponent and Kolmogorov entropy increase with increasing amplitude. In addition, the relation curves looks like stability lobes. The experimental study allow us to select optimal machining parameters for decreasing the uncertainty of cutting vibration...|$|E
40|$|Global {{interference}} detection is {{a critical}} problem in 5 -axis NC machining of free-form surfaces. Based on the hierarchical oriented bounding box (OBB) which is used in virtual reality to detect spatial collisions between 3 D objects, a new global interference detection method is developed in this paper. In this method, {{in order to simplify}} the computation process of updating tool positions and orientations in 5 -axis machining, the cutter and <b>cutter</b> <b>holder</b> are modeled by a hierarchical OBB structure, whereas the workpiece surfaces are approximated by an octree. Interference detection is conducted between the tool OBBs and the gray octants of the surface octree with the separating axis theorem. With the hierarchical structure of octree, if interference is found in one octant, its sub-octants are further processed to locate the exact colliding leaf nodes and the discretized surface points contained in these leaf nodes are tested with a conventional vector calculation method for exact interference detection; if no interference is detected, all the sub-octants are then considered as interference free and are not processed further. Meanwhile, with the hierarchical structure of the tool OBBs, should interference occur between octants and the OBBs in the first level of the hierarchical structure, the sub-OBBs in the second level would be further tested. Otherwise it could be determined with certainty that there is no interference between the tool and the octant...|$|E

Several {{kinds of}} main stalk and stubble processing technologies and corresponding machines used in Liaoning Province are researched in this paper. The key parameters influenced stubble chopping are analyzed {{on the basis}} of understanding the principles of “ 2 BISJ- 2110 precision planter”. In order to solve the shortcoming of disturbing much soil and more power loss of“ 2 BISJ- 2110 precision planter ” and achieve saving materials, reduce the cost and the water massive disappearing due to the agitation of the soil, entire stubble chopping is changed to seed line stubble chopping. Using the computer VB language to study the parameters of stalks and stubbles according to mathematical model about coulter ends and the path. In order to realize the narrow band and shallow treatment of the stalks and stubbles, taking single ridge width as 100 - 110 mm and using the Solidwork software to design and draw rotary blade, L stubble breaking blade, <b>cutter</b> head,blade <b>holder,</b> roller and so on. 2 kinds of feasible knife roll disposition plans are presented, which provides a design basis for new type narrow band rotary cultivation stalk and stubble chopper...|$|R
