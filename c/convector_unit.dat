Currently the hybrid system is used solely for providing fresh, warm air. The system consists of a wall-mounted <b>convector</b> <b>unit</b> coupled with an extract fan to draw the air into the convector. Fresh air from outside is tempered by circulating water around an internal heat exchange coil, before it passes into the room. This allows a constant supply of clean, filtered, conditioned air. Previous work involved {{the development of a}} computer model to predict air flow rates through the system installed in a small room (Turner & Awbi 2006), and testing the potential for the unit to be used for cooling. This study attempts to further explore the behaviour of the unit through the use of multi-zone modelling. Three convectors were simulated in a small apartment under a range of varying weather conditions. It was found that the extract fan was the dominant factor governing the air flow through the system, and that prevailing winds could increase the rate of ventilation...|$|E
