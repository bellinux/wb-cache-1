40|$|Presently, the gas {{centrifuge}} arranged in cascades {{is the most}} common method for enriching uranium in its fissionable isotope, 235 U. The enriching process can be modeled in two overarching steps. First, one examines the individual centrifuge machines, estimating enriching performance based on operating conditions such as the centrifuge feed flow rate and cut. Second, this information is built into a cascade analysis which considers the cascade structure (how the machines are linked together) as well as the total cascade feed, product, and waste flow rates. This paper, which focuses on {{the second half of the}} modeling process, outlines a method for analyzing one <b>centrifuge</b> <b>cascade</b> structure recently developed and implemented by Iran. The novel configuration consists of two conventional cascades interconnected in a tandem fashion. In this arrangement, the waste flow from the first cascade enters the second cascade as feed flow. The waste leaving this (the second) cascade becomes the overall waste flow and the associated product is reintroduced into the first cascade. Because the two cascades are linked – the flow leaving the first cascade affects the operation of the second cascade, and vice versa – the traditional method for analyzing single cascades is inadequate. This paper presents an extension of the conventional analysis procedure that is appropriate for tandem cascades. The new method is used to assess Iran’s tandem cascades, including their utility for producing highly-enriched uranium for nuclear weapons...|$|E

He collaborated with ElBaradei on The Age of Deception: Nuclear Diplomacy in Treacherous Times, a behind-the-scenes account of these nuclear crises, published by Henry Holt in 2011. The most eye-opening revelations in The Age of Deception, according to Coblentz, highlight “{{the degree to which}} political considerations by various governments trumped real avenues for diplomatic solutions.” Coblentz has described touring a munitions factory near Baghdad in the lead-up to the Iraq War, during which he observed Iraqi engineers forging 80-millimeter rocket shells. “The operator was using gloves and tongs to handle red-hot metal, but had no safety goggles; he was wearing sandals instead of safety shoes. Throughout the plant the most sophisticated pieces of equipment, with labels from Siemens and other hi-tech manufacturers, were layered with dust.” The operators admitted that most of the equipment had not worked in years. There was no equipment maintenance program, nor were there spare parts.

50|$|A gas {{centrifuge}} is {{a device that}} performs isotope separation of gases. A centrifuge relies {{on the principles of}} centripetal force accelerating molecules so that particles of different masses are physically separated in a gradient along the radius of a rotating container.A prominent use of {{gas centrifuge}}s is for the separation of uranium-235 from uranium-238. The gas centrifuge was developed to replace the gaseous diffusion method of uranium-235 extraction. High degrees of separation of these isotopes relies on using many individual <b>centrifuges</b> arranged in <b>cascade,</b> that achieve successively higher concentrations. This process yields higher concentrations of uranium-235 while using significantly less energy compared to the gaseous diffusion process.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} results are {{presented}} from four different particle size analysis techniques used to characterize {{the performance of a}} novel centrifugal gas-solid separator. The Post Cyclone (PoC), is a new secondary collector situated {{at the top of a}} conventional reverse flow cyclone which utilizes the residual swirl available at the outlet (vortex finder) to capture some of the escaped dust. A prototype PoC was tested for a Stairmand high-efficiency cyclone (diameter = 0. 4 m) under a range of operating conditions. It is inherent to the process that the size distributions of the captured and escaping dust from the PoC are very close, Moreover, only little dust bigger than 5 mu m escaped from the cyclone to the PoC, making grade efficiency curves unreliable above this particle size. This means that demands on the quality of the particle sizing for this application are especially strenuous. Therefore, four different types of analytical equipment, namely a disc <b>centrifuge,</b> a <b>cascade</b> impactor, a cyclone train and a laser scattering sizer were used to collect information about the size distribution of the particles. This work highlights the apparent merits and shortcomings of each of these methods and compares the experimental grade efficiencies obtained by the different methods. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} equations for a long-bowl centrifuge can be simplified {{to obtain}} a one-dimensional differential equation for the variation of the dimensionless axial velocity in the radial direction. Subject to the boundary conditions and conservation of mass, the equation may be integrated directly to provide the solution. For high rotational speeds the solution can be simplified when certain simplifying assumptions are made. The simplified solutions are often used to obtain the separation parameters required {{in the analysis of}} <b>centrifuges</b> and associated <b>cascades.</b> In this study the differential equation was revisited and a finite element solution of the differential equation was developed. The original solution was also studied and it was found to be consistent with the finite element solution.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{modeling of}} uranium isotopes (235 U, 238 U) separation process by centrifugation of {{is a key}} aspect for predicting the nuclear fuel enrichment plant performances under surveillance by the Nuclear Safeguards Authorities. In this paper are illustrated {{some aspects of the}} modeling of fast centrifuges for UF 6 gas enrichment and of a typical cascade enrichment plant with the Theoretical <b>Centrifuge</b> and <b>Cascade</b> Simulator (TCCS). The background theory for reproducing the flow field characteristics of a centrifuge is derived from the work of Cohen [1] where the separation parameters are calculated using the solution of a differential enrichment equation. In our case we chose to solve the hydrodynamic equations for the motion of a compressible fluid in a centrifugal field using the Berman – Olander vertical velocity radial distribution [2] and the solution was obtained using the Matlab software tool [3]. The importance of a correct estimation of the centrifuge separation parameters at different flow regimes, lies in the possibility to estimate in a reliable way the U enrichment plant performances, once the separation external parameters are set (feed flow rate and feed, product and tails assays) [4]. Using the separation parameters of a single centrifuge allow to determine the performances of an entire cascade and, for this purpose; the software Simulink [3] was used. The outputs of the calculation are the concentrations (assays) and the flow rates of the enriched (product) and depleted (tails) gas mixture. These models represent a valid additional tool, in order to verify the compliance of the U enrichment plant operator declarations with the “on site” inspectors’ measurements. JRC.
