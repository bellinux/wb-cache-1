5|$|Brood parasites {{occur in}} several bee {{families}} including the apid subfamily Nomadinae. Females of these bees lack pollen <b>collecting</b> structures (the scopa) {{and do not}} construct their own nests. They typically enter the nests of pollen <b>collecting</b> species, and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by the host bee. When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes the host larva's pollen ball, and often the host egg also. The Arctic bee species, Bombus hyperboreus, in particular are an aggressive species that attack and enslave other bees of the same subgenus. However, unlike many other bee brood parasites, they have pollen baskets and often collect pollen.|$|E
