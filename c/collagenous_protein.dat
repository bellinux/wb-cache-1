These CP are smaller than most vertebrate collagens characterized to date and share many characteristics with the small collagenous products translated in vitro from RNA isolated at this molt. C. elegans collagen genes, collagen-coding mRNA, and collagenous in vitro products that have been characterized are also small. Detection of small CP in vivo in C. elegans thus lends further support to the hypothesis that such small <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> are the primary gene product precursors to the larger <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> isolated from the C. elegans cuticle...|$|R
40|$|Cuticles {{isolated}} from second-stage juveniles and adult females of Meloidogyne incognita were purified by treatment with 1 % {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS). The juvenile cuticle was composed of three zones differing in their solubility in β-mercaptoethanol (BME). Proteins in the cortical and median zones were partially soluble in BME, whereas the basal zone was the least soluble. The BME-soluble proteins from the juvenile cuticle were separated into 12 bands by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and characterized as <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> based on their sensitivity to collagenase and amino acid composition. The adult cuticle consisted of two zones which were dissolved extensively by BME. The basal zone was completely solubilized, leaving behind a network of fibers corresponding to the cortical zone. The BME-soluble proteins from the adult cuticle were separated by electrophoresis into nine bands one of which constituted > 55 % of the total BME-soluble proteins. All bands were characterized as <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins.</b> <b>Collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> from juvenile cuticles also contained glycoproteins which were absent from the adult cuticles...|$|R
40|$|Chicken neural retina {{cells from}} 6 - to 7 -day embryos were labeled with [3 H]proline for 24 and 72 hr and the <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> {{of the medium}} were analyzed. Ninety percent of the <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> eluted from DEAE-cellulose columns as a peak near {{the middle of the}} gradient. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, this {{material}} consisted predominantly of a slowly migrating procollagen, a smaller amount of an intermediate migrating form, and some α-chain material. Limited enzymatic digestion of this DEAE peak material plus mapping of its CNBr peptides identified this material as a type II precursor. The remaining 10 % of the <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> eluted from DEAE-cellulose {{at the end of the}} gradient. Electrophoresis of this fraction showed four major bands. Two migrated near the type II precursors, a third migrated somewhat more slowly, and the fourth was near β-chain dimers. In addition, there were two minor bands. Limited pepsin digestion of this DEAE peak material produced two bands: one migrated slightly more slowly than α 1, and the second, considerably more slowly. The CNBr peptide pattern of this material appears to be different from any previously described. Thus, neural retina cells in culture synthesize at least two genetically distinct classes of <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins.</b> One represents precursors to type II. The second is composed of multiple, very high molecular weight forms which may represent precursors (procollagens) of a new genetic type(s) of collagen...|$|R
50|$|Blue mussels {{occasionally}} form clumps, or aggregates, {{of individuals}} when population density is low.The mussels attach {{to one another}} via <b>collagenous</b> <b>protein</b> strands called byssal threads. The aggregates are observed mostly in Mussel fields, which are short-lived populations of Mussels, usually exhibiting a clumped distribution pattern. It is hypothesized that the mussels form these aggregates to increase reproductive success in low density populations. This hypothesis, however, {{has yet to be}} conclusively proven. Alternative possible reasons for the behavior include resisting wave action and increasing water flow through the siphons of the mussel. The significance of the behavior is its relation to the formation of mussel beds from mussel fields. Mussel beds are persistent, dense mussel populations. Beds generally form from fields that persist long enough to establish a dense population. Thus in areas where blue mussels are threatened, such as the Wadden Sea, it is of great importance to enhance the survival of mussel fields, of which mussel aggregates are the primary component.|$|E

Morphologically, while low concentrations of LTA elicited a subtle effect characterized by progressive cellular degeneration with practically no release of protein, larger concentrations (greater than 50 micrograms/ml) of this amphiphile resulted in rapid death of cell monolayers. Metabolic studies utilized a concentration of LTA (17. 5 micrograms/ml) which caused the smallest change in cell morphology in the least number of mouse fibroblast cells per monolayer. Under these conditions, cell monolayers showed an increase of 450 % in their content of <b>collagenous</b> <b>protein</b> after exposure to LTA. However, the amount of such material secreted remained unchanged. Also, changes in the type of <b>collagenous</b> <b>protein</b> formed were observed after exposure to LTA. <b>Collagenous</b> <b>protein</b> accumulating intracellularly was found to be practically hydroxyproline-free. However, <b>collagenous</b> <b>protein</b> secreted by this cell line showed a significantly reduced content of hydroxyproline as compared with control cells unexposed to this coccal membrane component. Column chromatographic studies confirmed that the <b>collagenous</b> <b>protein</b> secreted by monolayers exposed to LTA was defective (under hydroxylated). It was concluded that LTA does not affect the amount of <b>collagenous</b> <b>protein</b> secreted. However, it does increase the amount of this protein formed and retained by this cell line as well as causing a reduction in the hydroxylation of proline in both intracellular and secreted collagenous material. A possible relationship between abnormal basement membrane morphology and disturbed collagen synthesis in post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis as related to LTA is discussed...|$|E

Chem. 257, 11437 - 11442]. To examine further {{the expression of}} extracellular-matrix proteins by muscle cells, we have analysed the <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> secreted by G 8 - 1 myoblasts. We have found that collagens and/or procollagens, corresponding to genetic types I, III and IV (and possibly V), are produced and secreted by G 8 - 1 myoblasts. The major secreted collagenous polypeptides were identified as alpha 1 type I and its precursors by using pulse-chase studies, pepsin and collagenase digestions and CNBr fragmentation. The presence of lesser amounts of the other collagens was determined by immunoprecipitation. These results demonstrate that clonal skeletal-muscle cells, {{in the absence of}} fibroblasts and an exogenous collagen substrate, are able to synthesize and secrete several extracellular-matrix <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> in proportions similar to those which are commonly found in muscle tissue and mixed cultures of muscle cells and fibroblasts...|$|R

In this thesis, the intracellular interactions of the non-structural HCV proteins with the host-cell were investigated. NS 4 b, the non-structural protein responsible for the induction of intracellular membrane alterations, was demonstrated to associate to membranes via its C-terminal tail. This attachment to the membrane {{is similar to the}} bacterial protein d-LDH, i. e. through positive residues (amino acid side chains) with the negative headgroups of lipids.

GLT 25 D 1, which galactosylates <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins,</b> was shown to be an NS 3 associated protein. Additionally, GLT 25 D 1 was shown to be a soluble luminal ER-protein, suggesting galactosylation of <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> takes place in the ER.

40|$|A {{group of}} collagenlike {{recombinant}} proteins containing high densities of biologically active sites has been invented. The method {{used to express}} these proteins {{is similar to a}} method of expressing recombinant procollagens and collagens described in U. S. Patent 5, 593, 859, "Synthesis of human procollagens and collagens in recombinant DNA systems. " Customized <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> are needed for biomedical applications. In particular, fibrillar collagens are attractive for production of matrices needed for tissue engineering and drug delivery. Prior to this invention, there was no way of producing customized <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> for these and other applications. Heretofore, <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> have been produced by use of such biological systems as yeasts, bacteria, and transgenic animals and plants. These products are normal collagens that can also be extracted from such sources as tendons, bones, and hides. These products cannot be made to consist only of biologically active, specific amino acid sequences that may be needed for specific applications. Prior to this invention, it had been established that fibrillar collagens consist of domains that are responsible for such processes as interaction with cells, binding of growth factors, and interaction with a number of structural proteins present in the extracellular matrix. A normal collagen consists of a sequence of domains that can be represented by a corresponding sequence of labels, e. g., D 1 D 2 D 3 D 4. A collagenlike protein of the present invention contains regions of collagen II that contain multiples of a single domain (e. g., D 1 D 1 D 1 D 1 or D 4 D 4 D 4 D 4) chosen for its specific biological activity. By virtue of the multiplicity of the chosen domain, the density of sites having that specific biological activity is greater than it is in a normal collagen.

Fortunately, chicken bones are also rich in <b>collagenous</b> <b>protein</b> that possesses various functional properties. Considering this fact, the aims of this work are to determine the effect of pH and stirring speed on the alkaline extraction of <b>collagenous</b> <b>protein</b> from chicken bone. The experiments were carried out in a standard three necked flask equipped with heat supply, condensing and agitation facilities to perform isothermic well mixed extraction system. The extraction was conducted using caustic soda solution as solvent, extraction time (1 hour), temperature (80 oC), the ratio of chicken bones:solvent (g/mL) = 1 : 4, and bone powders particle size (425 μm). The studied variables are pH: 9, 10, 11 and stirring speed: 100, 200, 300 rpm. The results showed that higher stirring speed and alkalinity of the extraction process resulted in higher protein yield. However, at very high stirring speed (300 rpm) and too alkaline (pH 11) extraction condition, the extraction lost its efficiency. The highest protein yield was achieved when the extraction was performed at pH 10 and stirring speed of 200 rpm for 60 minutes...|$|E
40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of collagen and fibronectin molecules by cultivated glomerular epithelial or mesangial cells was {{studied at}} confluency using radioactive proline or lysine as precursors. Collagen represented 0. 5 % {{of the total}} protein synthesized by the glomerular epithelial cells. About 60 % of this <b>collagenous</b> <b>protein</b> were associated to the cell layer, whereas about 40 % were secreted into the culture medium. Two major collagenous polypeptides were observed with apparent molecular weights of 185 K and 170 K, and were identified as two gene products of type IV procollagen. They exhibited ratios of 3 - to 4 -hydroxyproline, of total hydroxyproline to proline, and of hydroxylysine to lysine characteristic of type IV procollagen. They were degraded by bacterial collagenase. The patterns of peptides obtained after digestion of the 185 K and 170 K chains of this type IV procollagen with pepsin and V 8 protease were identical to those obtained after digestion of type IV procollagen chains purified from a murine tumor (EHS sarcoma). Finally. a purified antibody to type IV collagen specifically immunoprecipitated the <b>collagenous</b> <b>protein</b> produced by the glomerular epithelial cells. By contrast, the mesangial cells synthesized about 5 % of <b>collagenous</b> <b>protein.</b> 90 % of this collagen were secreted into the cultured medium, whereas about 10 % remained associated to the cell layer. Type I, III and IV procollagens were synthesized by the mesangial cells. Fibronectin {{was found in the}} medium and cell layer of both epithelial and mesangial cells. Fibronectin molecules were identified by their resistance to bacterial collagenase, their susceptibility to pepsin digestion, and their specific adherence to collagen. It was composed of disulfide-linked peptides of 220 K daltons. The data therefore demonstrate that: (a) the glomerular epithelial and mesangial cells synthesize fibronectin molecules and type IV procollagen in vitro; (b) the cultivated mesangial cells also synthesize type I and III collagens. The implications of these findings in certain pathological circumstances, such as diabetes mellitus, are now being investigated. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The synthesis of <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> was close to normal in EDS type VII A cells. The synthesis of type III procollagen per cell was increased, as also was the ratio of immunoreactive type III procollagen to total collagen production.

Type III amino-terminal proteinase activity was of a level found in normal cells when expressed relative to the protein or DNA, {{and the release of}} type III amino-terminal propeptides was nevertheless not disturbed in these EDS type VII cell cultures.

This {{study was designed to}} determine if this biochemical finding segregated with the disease within an individual family. Dermal fibroblast strains were established from three generations of a family having the typical features of type I OI. Analysis of the <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> made in culture revealed an elevated alpha 1 (III) to alpha 1 (I) collagen type ratio and an elevated alpha 1 (I) to alpha 2 (I) collagen chain ratio. The procollagen that accumulated in the medium reflected these ratios to the same degree. Total collagen synthesis was significantly reduced in affected family members. Therefore, the most striking abnormality in affected members was a 50 - 75 % reduction of type I collagen production. Furthermore, the ratio of the alpha 1 (I) /alpha 2 (I) collagen messenger RNA (mRNA), measured by dot hybridization, was one-half of the value of uninvolved family members and unrelated controls. Since the reduction in the production of type I collagen and the altered alpha 1 (I) /alpha 2 (I) mRNA ratio clearly segregated with affected individuals within this family, these biochemical measurements may be a useful genetic marker for type I OI...|$|R

Glycosyl transferase 25 domain 1 (GLT 25 D 1) was recently {{shown to have}} galactosyltransferase activity towards collagens and another well known substrate, mannose binding lectin (MBL). To gain more insight {{in the role of}} galactosylation of lysines in the Gly-X-Lys repeats of <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins,</b> we investigated the subcellular localization of GLT 25 D 1. Results Immunofluorescence analysis of GLT 25 D 1 expressed in the human hepatoma cell line (Huh 7), revealed a perinuclear lattice like staining, resembling localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Possible targeting signals, an N-terminal signal sequence and a C-terminal ER-retention signal, were identified using prediction programs. These signals were then investigated by constructing a series of epitope-tagged forms of GLT 25 D 1 that were analyzed by immunofluorescence and western blotting. In agreement with the predictions our results show that GLT 25 D 1 is directed to the ER lumen as a soluble protein and retained there. Moreover, using two endoglycosidase enzymes EndoH and EndoF, we demonstrate that the putative bi-functional glycosyl transferase itself is a glycoprotein. Additionally we examined co-localization of GLT 25 D 1 with MBL and lysyl hydroxylase 3 (LH 3, PLOD 3), which is a protein able to catalyze hydroxylation of lysine residues before they can be glycosylated. We demonstrate overlapping localization patterns of GLT 25 D 1, MBL and LH 3. Conclusions Taken together our data indicate that galactosylation of <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> by the soluble GLT 25 D 1 occurs in the early secretory pathway. </p...|$|R

Expression of α 2 (I) collagen (COL 1 A 2) mRNA was measured by northern blot, and the activity of COL 1 A 2 promoter was determined by a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. CPT (10 - 7 M) decreased the deposition of type I collagen by 68 %, of type III by 38 %, and of type VI by 21 % in SSc fibroblasts and to a lesser degree in healthy controls. Similarly, CPT (10 - 8 M to 10 - 6 M) significantly inhibited secretion of newly synthesized <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> into conditioned media by 50 %.

40|$|We {{have studied}} a murine tumor {{previously}} {{classified as a}} poorly differentiated chondrosarcoma. Although the cells in this tumor are surrounded by large quantities of extracellular matrix material, the matrix fails to react with stains specific for the sulfated glycosaminoglycans present in normal cartilage. Here we show at the ultrastructural level that the tumor matrix is a homogeneous, nonfibrillar material, resembling basement membrane. Neither the proteoglycan matrix granules nor collagen fibrils characteristic of cartilage {{are present in the}} tumor matrix. Amino acid analyses of whole tumor tissue, enzyme-solubilized tumor components, and the protein extracted from lathyritic tumors confirmed that the tumor matrix is a basement membrane collagen. The <b>collagenous</b> <b>protein</b> extracted from the tumor by nonenzymatic means contains three unique polypeptides larger than the alpha-chain components of the other types of collagen. These studies indicate that the tumor is not a type of chondrosarcoma but a basement membrane producing tumor...|$|E
40|$|We {{recently}} {{described the}} cDNA sequence for a unique <b>collagenous</b> <b>protein,</b> preCol-P, in the byssal threads {{of the marine}} mussel Mytilus edulis. The translated amino acid sequence encodes an unprecedented block-copolymer-like sequence with a central collagenous domain flanked by elastin-like sequences. Here, {{we report on the}} presence of two additional variants of preCol-P. The distribution of these variants in M. edulis foot tissue was examined by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization techniques. One of the variants, P 33, exhibits a graded distribution Summary with decreasing concentrations along the longitudinal axis of the foot. The second variant, P 22, is expressed only {{at the base of the}} mussel’s foot. In situ hybridization confirms the exclusive expression of preCol-P variant P 22 in the stem gland. We propose that this variant may represent a molecular ‘dovetail ’ between the proximal thread and the byssal stem, imparting extensibility and elastic recoil to the ring portion of the stem...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA short {{stretch of}} 35 amino acids is {{identified}} as the structural motif responsible for the tight parallel association and trimerization of the three identical polypeptide chains of lung surfactant protein D, which contains both collagen regions and C-type lectin domains. This ‘neck-region’ {{is located at the}} nucleation site at which the collagenous sequences fold into a staggered triple-helix and is shown, by CD, NMR, and cross-linking of recombinant peptides, to consist of a triple-stranded parallel α-helical bundle in a non-staggered, and extremely strong, non-covalent association. This type of association between three polypeptide chains may represent a common structural feature immediately following the C-terminal end of the triple-helical region of <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work we {{examined}} the "in vivo" effects of collagen breakdown products derived from elastase digestion on lung collagen synthesis in rabbits. It was found that i. v. injection of collagen peptides greatly enhances the collagen synthesis rate while {{does not affect the}} synthesis of non <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins.</b> The increase of incorporation of 3 H-proline in lung collagen parallels that of prolyl hydroxylase activity. The collagen synthesis, expressed as fractional rate (% day), amounted to 15 % day in treated animals, resulting in a significant increase with respect to controls (11. 7 % day). The observations reported provide evidence that collagen breakdown products stimulate lung collagen synthesis and {{may play a role in}} collagen homeostasi...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the biosynthetic patterns of interstitial collagens in mouse embryonic submandibular and sublingual glands cultured in vitro. Rudiments explanted on day 13 of gestation and cultured for 24, 48, and 72 h all synthesized collagen types I, III, and V. However, while the total incorporation of label into <b>collagenous</b> <b>proteins</b> {{did not change}} over the three-day culture period, the rate of accumulation of newly synthesized types I and III did change. At 24 h, the ratio of newly synthesized collagen types I:III was approximately 2, whereas at 72 h, the ratio was approximately 5. These data suggest that collagen types I and III may be important in initiation of branching in this organ, but that type I may become dominant in the later stages of development and in maintenance of the adult organ...|$|R
