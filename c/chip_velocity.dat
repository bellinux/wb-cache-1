40|$|Nanometric {{cutting of}} single crystal silicon on {{different}} crystal orientations {{and at a}} wide range of temperatures (300 - 1500 K) was studied through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using two sorts of interatomic potentials, an analytical bond order potential (ABOP) and a modified version of Tersoff potential, so as to explore the cutting chip characteristics and chip formation mechanisms. Smaller released thermal energy and larger values of chip ratio (ratio of the uncut chip thickness to the cut chip thickness) as well as shear plane angle were obtained when cutting was performed at higher temperatures or on the (1 1 1) crystal plane, implying an enhancement in machinability of silicon. Nonetheless, the subsurface deformation depth was observed to become deeper under the aforementioned conditions. Further analysis revealed a higher number of atoms in the chip when cutting was implemented on the (1 1 0) crystal plane, attributable to the lower position of the stagnation region which triggered less ploughing action of the tool on the silicon substrate. Regardless of temperature of the substrate the minimum <b>chip</b> <b>velocity</b> angle was found while cutting the (1 1 1) crystal plane of silicon substrate whereas the maximum <b>chip</b> <b>velocity</b> angle appeared on the (1 1 0) surface. A discrepancy between the two potential functions in predicting the <b>chip</b> <b>velocity</b> angle was observed at high temperature of 1500 K, resulting from the overestimated phase instability and entirely molten temperatures of silicon by the ABOP function. Another key observation was that the resultant force exerted by the rake face of the tool on the chip was found to decrease by 24 % when cutting the (1 1 1) surface at 1173 K compared to that at room temperature. Besides, smaller resultant force, friction coefficient at the tool/chip interface and chip temperature was witnessed on the (1 1 1) crystal plane, as opposed to the other orientations...|$|E
40|$|The contact {{conditions}} {{along the}} chip-tool interface in machining {{have been studied}} {{using a combination of}} transparent sapphire tools, in-situ high-speed direct observations of this interface, and force measurements. Results have shown that the contact along this interface consists of four distinct regions: a region of stagnation at the cutting edge, a region of retardation adjoining the stagnation region, a region of sliding beyond the retardation region, followed by a region of sticking that is located furthest away from the cutting edge. While material in the stagnation region is stationary with respect to the tool, this region is confined to a very small fraction of the chip-tool interface. In the region of retardation, motion of the chip material has been observed at the chip-tool interface, but the velocity of this motion is less than that of the bulk <b>chip</b> <b>velocity.</b> The region of sliding is characterized by interfacial sliding at a velocity equal to the bulk <b>chip</b> <b>velocity.</b> The last region of contact, termed the sticking region, exhibits material transfer from the chip to the tool. This region of sticking {{has been found to be}} highly dependent on the cutting velocity. This work, for the first time, has provided direct experimental evidence for the theoretical model of the contact conditions proposed by Oxley. Force measurements have shown that the region of sticking carries little load, and is thus subjected to the lowest stresses, while the regions of contact subjected to the highest stresses, namely, the stagnation, retardation and sliding regions, show no material transfer from the chip to the tool. Further evidence for the development of the regions of stagnation and retardation has been provided by combining measurements of the force evolution with direct observations of the contact evolution. The condition of the cutting edge, at or below the micron level, has been shown to have a controlling influence on the chip-tool interface and the overall mechanics of machining. The condition of the cutting edge is believed to play a controlling factor in the development of the stagnation and retardation zones. Experiments with non-oxide tools such as aluminum and steel have provided evidence that our model of the contact conditions is equally applicable with other tool materials. ...|$|E

For certain applications, typically involving high-precision components, it is desirable to detect the variability in material properties such as grain size or hardness of the workpiece material. The hardness of a finished part is determined using a high speed video camera (4000 frames/sec) and an image processing algorithm. The algorithm has a feed-forward data flow that consists of three stages: edge detection of the frame, interframe differencing to eliminate any static particles, and a cross-correlation routine to determine the <b>chip</b> <b>velocity.</b> This velocity yields information pertaining to the hardness of the metal, i. e. slower velocities correspond to softer materials, etc. Processing in real-time is necessary because of the high frame rate of the camera. Thus, a specialized hardware system is investigated.

40|$|The low thermal {{conductivity}} of titanium, {{together with the}} low contact area between chip and tool and the unusually high <b>chip</b> <b>velocities,</b> gives rise to high tool tip temperatures and accelerated tool wear.

40|$|Steam {{explosion}} (SE) pretreatment produces {{damaged and}} disintegrated biomass {{with a large}} surface area which facilitates enzymatic hydrolysis {{for the production of}} biofuels and other value-added chemicals. It was observed during experiments that wood chips disintegrate into smaller pieces because of collisions and impact with each other and the walls of the SE equipment. In this study, these events were simulated using the finite element method. Wood chips were simulated in this model as a linear elastic material until failure. The damage initiation was identified using Hashin’s damage initiation criteria. Once the damage was initiated, additional loading caused the evolution of damage, i. e. degradation and breakage of the material, which was modelled using the material property degradation model and deletion of the failed elements. Elastic and strength properties of spruce wood were estimated at ambient conditions (12  % moisture content at 20  °C) and at SE conditions (30  % moisture content at 160  °C). Comparison of simulations performed using material properties at ambient and SE conditions revealed that the damage in wood chips significantly increased because of the steam treatment. The effects of wood <b>chip</b> <b>velocity</b> and orientation at the time of impact were studied as well. It was found that wood chips moving at high velocity and impacting with the steel wall in the radial direction acquire the most damage. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E

This {{experimental}} study {{is aimed at}} obtaining the temperature distribution along the tool-chip interface in the steady state orthogonal machining of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V {{with a high level}} of accuracy. Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (YAG) is identified as a new transparent tool material which could successfully machine this ‘difficult-to-machine’ alloy. A unique fixture is developed to hold this transparent tool using which cameras sensitive to visible and infrared radiation observed the machining process in-situ and image, at a high speed, the radiation emitted from the tool-chip interface in a field less than 1 mm wide. The radiation intensity is converted to local temperature through a calibration process performed by imaging a blackbody in place of the chip at the tool-chip interface for the range of expected temperatures. The time averaged temperature maps show a hot region adjacent and parallel to the cutting edge. The temperature is uniform in the direction along the cutting edge, but decrease near the side boundaries of the chip. The time averaged temperature profiles show an increase of temperature with distance from cutting edge in the direction of chip flow. The temperature peaks 900 ⁰C to 1050 ⁰C at half of the contact length and then decreases. The uncertainty for reported values in maps is 10 K and that in profiles is 6 K. Time resolved temperatures are obtained using visible and IR camera systems using very low exposure times and the evolution of rake face temperature with respect to time is predicted.

40|$|Diamond {{tools are}} {{increasingly}} used in advanced manufacturing {{because of their}} unique properties such as high hardness and thermal conductivity, and low thermal expansion unbeatable by any other known material. Despite their importance in machining of precision parts, extensive research on diamond tool wear is still underway. Particularly, maintaining the cutting edge sharpness and prolonging tool life are very important for machining difficult-to-cut materials. It is believed {{that the existence of}} stagnant zone on the tool rake face during cutting can protect the cutting edge from rapid wear. In this research, a new analytical stagnant zone model is derived based on boundary layer theory in fluid mechanics. The stagnant zone model predicts the stagnant zone length on diamond tools when machining titanium alloy. The cutting tool stress and <b>chip</b> <b>velocity</b> distributions required for the analysis of the stagnant zone model were taken from Finite Element (FE) modelling and simulation of orthogonal machining. Machining of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V with polycrystalline diamond and diamond-coated tools were experimentally carried out to obtain cutting forces and stagnant zone information at various cutting conditions. Used tools and postprocessed chips were investigated under scanning electron (SEM), field-emission scanning electron (FE-SEM) and optical microscopes. In FE modelling, input data such as material properties and the constants required in Johnson-Cook constitutive model were taken from the literature, and the friction data were calculated from experimentally measured forces. FE simulations were carried out for various cutting speeds, feeds, edge radius and surface roughness of the tool. The developed FE model is validated by comparing the predicted and experimental cutting forces. The predicted cutting forces are agreeable with the experiments. MATLAB is used to fit the equations that represent velocity and stress distribution as well as to calculate the stagnant zone length in the developed stagnant zone model. It is found that the predicted values are closed to the experimental results for both diamond tools. The average stagnant zone lengths formed at certain cutting conditions are between 0. 1 mm and 0. 3 mm. The used tool geometry, chip morphology and simulated shear strain, temperature, and velocity plots are also consistent with stagnant zone formation. The proposed stagnant zone model indicates that formation of stagnant zone is a function of cutting condition, tool geometry, the tool surface finish and material properties...|$|E

40|$|Hard turning (HT) is a {{material}} removal process employing {{a combination of}} a single point cutting tool and high speeds to machine hard ferrous alloys which exhibit hardness values over 45 HRC. In this paper, a surface defect machining (SDM) method for HT is proposed which harnesses the combined advantages of porosity machining and pulsed laser pre-treatment processing. From previous experimental work, this was shown to provide better controllability of the process and improved quality of the machined surface. While the experiments showed promising results, a comprehensive understanding of this new technique could only be achieved through a rigorous, in depth theoretical analysis. Therefore, an assessment of the SDM technique was carried out using both finite element method (FEM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. FEM modelling was used to compare the conventional HT of AISI 4340 steel (52 HRC) using an AlO insert with the proposed SDM method. The simulations showed very good agreement with the previously published experimental results. Compared to conventional HT, SDM provided favourable machining outcomes, such as reduced shear plane angle, reduced average cutting forces, improved surface roughness, lower residual stresses on the machined surface, reduced tool-chip interface contact length and increased <b>chip</b> flow <b>velocity.</b> Furthermore, a scientific explanation of the improved surface finish was revealed using a state-of-the-art MD simulation model which suggested that during SDM, a combination of both the cutting action and rough polishing action help improve the machined surface finish...|$|R

40|$|Hard turning is {{emerging}} as a key technology to substitute conventional grinding processes, mainly on account of lower equipment cost, short setup time, and a reduced number of process steps. This is, however, being impeded {{by a number of}} challenges required to be resolved, including attainable surface roughness, surface deteriorations, surface residual stresses and metallurgical transformations on the machined steel surface (white layer). In this thesis, a novel approach named Surface Defect Machining (SDM) is proposed as a viable solution to resolve a large number of these issues and to improve surface finish and surface integrity. SDM is defined as a process of machining, where a workpiece is first subjected to surface defects creation at a depth less than the uncut chip thickness; either through mechanical and/or thermal means; then followed by a normal machining operation so as to reduce the cutting resistance. A comprehensive understanding of SDM is established theoretically using finite element method (FEM). Also, an experimental study has been carried out for extensive understanding of the new technique. A good agreement between theoretical and experimental investigations has been achieved. The results show very interesting salient features of SDM, providing favourable machining outcomes. These include: reduced shear plane angle, reduced machining forces, lower residual stresses on the machined surface, reduced tool-chip interface contact length and increased <b>chip</b> flow <b>velocity,</b> as well as reductions in overall temperature in the cutting zone and changing the mechanism of chip morphology from jagged to discontinuous. However, the most prominent outcome is the improved attainable surface roughness. Furthermore, SDM shows the ability to exceed the critical feed rate and achieve an optical surface finish upto 30 nm. A scientific explanation of the improved surface roughness suggests that during SDM, a combination of both the cutting action and the rough polishing action help to improve the machined surface. Based on these findings, it is anticipated that a component machined using the SDM method should exhibit improved quality of the machined surface, which is expected to provide tremendous commercial advantages in the time to come...|$|R

Wood chips and bark pellets were used as tracer particles. Characterization of the fuel mixing pattern was made by single tracer particle tracking while tracking of batches of tracer particles was applied to quantify the fuel mixing through lateral dispersion coefficients. The experimental technique shows good repeatability and dispersion coefficients {{are found to be}} in the order of 10 (- 3) m(2) /s. The lateral transport of the wood chips is observed to occur mainly while these are submerged in the dense bed. Increased fluidization velocity accentuates this pattern, i. e. the share of time spent in the dense bed increases. Only for the wood <b>chips</b> the fluidization <b>velocity</b> was found to have an influence on the lateral dispersion coefficient, which is due to that these are of larger size and lower density than the bark particles. Diffusion-type modeling of the horizontal fuel dispersion is discussed, concluding that such an approach is not suitable in cases with low lateral fuel mixing rate or with a characteristic mixing length in the same order as the lateral length scale of the bed. As alternative, this paper proposes a macroscopic modeling approach for the lateral fuel mixing, which includes physical parameters relating to the local mixing mechanisms, operational conditions and fuel particle properties.

40|$|Face-hobbing is the {{dominant}} and the most productive machining process for manufacturing bevel and hypoid gears. Bevel gears {{are one of the}} most important power transmission components, in automobile to aerospace industries, where the power is transmitted between two non-parallel axes. In current industries, the face-hobbing process confronts two major challenges, the tool wear and trial and error experiments to select machining parameters. In the present work, these two problems are targeted. The tool wear in face-hobbing happens at the tool corners of the cutting blades due to the multi-flank chip formation and large gradient of working rake and relief angles along the cutting edge at the corners. In addition, the cutting fluid absence contributes in the tool wear phenomena. In the present work, a cutting tool design method is proposed in order to improve the tool wear characteristics especially at the tool corners. The rake and relief surfaces of the conventional cutting blades are re-designed in such a way that normal rake and relief angles during the face-hobbing process are kept constant and consequently the gradients of these two angles are minimized, theoretically to zero. Using mathematical tool wear characterization relationship and also FEM simulation, the improvements in tool wear are approved. In addition, in the present thesis, semi-analytical methods are proposed to optimize the face-hobbing process in order to select appropriate machining settings. The optimization problem is constructed in such a way that the machining time is minimized subject to the tool rake wear or cutting force related constraints. In order to predict the tool rake wear (crater wear depth), methods are proposed to calculate un-deformed chip geometry, cutting forces, normal stresses, interface cutting temperature and <b>chip</b> sliding <b>velocity.</b> The un-deformed <b>chip</b> geometry is obtained using two proposed methods numerically and semi-analytically. In the numerical method, the workpiece in-process model is obtained and then the un-deformed chip geometry is approximated using the in-process model. In the semi-analytical method, an un-deformed chip boundary theory is constructed in such a way that the boundary curves of the un-deformed chip are formulated by closed form equations. The obtained un-deformed chip geometry is discretized along the cutting edge of the blades. Each infinitesimal element is considered as a small oblique cut. The differential cutting forces are predicted for each individual element using oblique cutting transformation theory. The total cutting forces are derived by integrating the differential cutting forces along the cutting edge. The proposed methods are applied on case studies of non-generated face-hobbing of gears to show the capability of the methods to find the un-deformed chip geometry, predict cutting forces and finally find the optimum machining parameters in non-generated face-hobbing...|$|R

Metal cutting {{subjects}} {{the material}} being cut to high strain rates (103 - 106 /s) and strains> 100 % within the primary shear zone (PSZ). This thesis {{is aimed at}} quantitative measurement of the strain, strain rate and flow stress in the PSZ {{in order to provide}} data {{that can be used to}} verify and improve high strain rate material models. An experimental study of the cutting forces, <b>chip</b> thickness, and <b>velocity</b> fields in the PSZ, has been carried out during the cutting of AISI 4340 steel in three different tempers; hot rolled steel, hardness 18 HRc, referred to as AISI 4340 HR; hot rolled steel with additional 50 % cold rolling, hardness 27 HRc referred to as AISI 4340 CR; Heat treated (quenched and tempered) steel, hardness 45 HRc, referred to as AISI 4340 HT; and Titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Kennametal make KC 510 M inserts with edge radius 6 μm is used for all the cutting experiments reported and is mounted on a tool holder which provides a rake angle of 30 o and a clearance angle of 4 o. The KC 510 M inserts are used in an effort to minimize the side spread of the material. A new type of ultra high-speed camera is used to capture sequential and high resolution microphotographs of the PSZ during machining at frame rates ranging from a few kHz to 1 MHz. The velocity fields are obtained by 2 D cross-correlation of sequential images and the gradient of the velocity field yields the strain rate field. Each experiment yields four to seven strain rate fields from which the average strain rate field is obtained. Average strain rate fields found in multiple experiments are averaged to obtain the overall average strain rate for the cutting condition. As the shear velocity (Vs) needs to be same throughout the chip width for the chip to be moving as a rigid body, the shear angle has to be constant from the sides to the mid-section of the chip. Two independent estimates of the shear angle, from the velocity field and from the chip thickness, show reasonable correlation. The shear angle from chip thickness is an average over each experiment, while the shear angle from velocities is an instantaneous value and is taken to be the true value. The 'indentation' component of the cutting forces is calculated from the measured cutting forces using the ratio of flow stress in the PSZ to the contact pressure observed in finite element analysis (FEA) simulations. The flow stress along the nominal shear plane is computed from the measured shear angle and cutting forces, after removal of the 'indentation' component. The thickness of the PSZ is smaller and the peak strain rate is higher for AISI 4340 CR compared to AISI 4340 HR, due to reduced work hardening. While the forces are found to be nearly the same, the vii shear angle is larger and the flow stress is smaller for the AISI 4340 CR material. For the AISI 4340 HT, the flow stress is found to be about 10 - 20 % larger compared to AISI 4340 HR. The PSZ is typically parallel sided and shows a single peak in the CD direction along the PSZ while cutting AISI 4340 HR, AISI 4340 CR, AISI 4340 HT and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. The strain rate near the cutting edge is high and gradually decreases as we move towards the free end while cutting AISI 4340 HR and AISI 4340 CR. The strain rate near the cutting edge and the free end of the PSZ is high but lower in the middle of the PSZ, while cutting AISI 4340 HT. The mode of deformation while cutting AISI 4340 HR and AISI 4340 CR is inhomogeneous, meaning the same regions of the work material accumulate deformation and the shear ‘plane’ moves with the material over time, till eventually switching over to a new shear ‘plane’. The high-speed images of the PSZ while cutting Ti- 6 Al- 4 V clearly show localized bands of shear separated by larger bands of less deformed material, implying the deformation continues to concentrate within the same region of the material. The chip is thinner and quantitatively shows that the shear band is at the same region with respect to the workpiece. We have compared and contrasted the deformation process of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V with that of AISI 4340 HR and AISI 4340 CR. For the same cutting speed and feed, the strain rate while machining Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is higher and the PSZ narrower when compared to AISI 4340 CR...|$|R
