5000|$|From the 1950s Shchedrovitsky {{developed}} {{a series of}} seminars which attracted mathematicians, psychologists, historians, architects, sociologists and physicians who focused their discussions of logical and epistemological issues. He {{became involved in the}} Moscow Metatheoretical Circle set up by Alexander Zinoviev. In 1954, Shchedrovitsky took over leadership of the circle and played a prominent role in developing activity theory. Here the world was not seen as composed of human subjects and objects as in naturalistic theory. Rather objects are secondary constructs whose nature depends on the activity applied to them. Shchedrovitsky argued that activity was not so much an attribute of any individual but rather a system within which an individual is [...] "captured" [...] and which determines how they behave. Further he reflected on the task of the scientist, bearing in mind that a particular complex [...] "object" [...] might be viewed from a number of different scientific perspectives: thus the work of the scientist involves not just examining the object within a specific scientific framework, but must also involve the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>methodology</b> by which the subject is marked as a distinct subject of scientific enquiry.|$|E
5000|$|Echoes of the [...] "positivist" [...] and [...] "antipositivist" [...] debate persist today, {{though this}} {{conflict}} {{is hard to}} define. Authors writing in different epistemological perspectives do not phrase their disagreements in the same terms and rarely actually speak directly to each other. To complicate the issues further, few practicing scholars explicitly state their epistemological commitments, and their epistemological position thus has to be guessed from other sources such as <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>methodology</b> or theory. However, no perfect correspondence between these categories exists, and many scholars critiqued as [...] "positivists" [...] are actually postpositivists. One scholar has described this debate {{in terms of the}} social construction of the [...] "other", with each side defining the other by what it is not rather than what it is, and then proceeding to attribute far greater homogeneity to their opponents than actually exists. Thus, it is better to understand this not as a debate but as two different arguments: the [...] "antipositivist" [...] articulation of a social meta-theory which includes a philosophical critique of scientism, and [...] "positivist" [...] development of a scientific research methodology for sociology with accompanying critiques of {{the reliability and validity of}} work that they see as violating such standards.|$|E

The research project involved a detailed study of 33 building projects constructed in Melbourne during the period 1987 to 1993. The principal research objective was to understand better why some buildings are constructed faster than others, by identifying risk factors and how construction managers respond to them. Multiple regression {{analysis was used to}} derive a model that predicts construction time from a representative sample of projects. The performance model was then used to compare predicted with actual construction project duration to develop a construction time performance index. This performance ratio was then used to compare 102 variable factors by testing the null hypothesis that each variable does not affect construction time performance (at the 95 % confidence level). Correlation analysis of all identified variables was also undertaken to link associations between factors for those affecting and not affecting construction time performance. The contribution {{of this paper is to}} identify one research approach for a specific research problem within the construction discipline so that others may be aware of this when making a <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>methodologies</b> for pursuing their own research work.

The primary objective is to provide new information on the effects of <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>methodology</b> on efficiency estimates. We also investigate some classic industrial organization issues in the life insurance industry. The alternative methodologies give significantly different estimates of efficiency for the insurers in our sample. The efficiency rankings are quite well-preserved among the econometric methodologies; but the rank correlations are lower between the econometric and mathematical programming categories and between alternative mathematical programming methodologies. Thus, the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>methodology</b> can {{have a significant effect on}} the results.

In this paper we analyse the links between the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>methodology</b> and different theories of normative moral philosophy. The choice of electricity data in an LCA of a conference site with local hydropower production is discussed as an illustration. The two types of LCA can be related to different theories on the characteristics of a good action. Each type of LCA, as well as each of the moral theories, can be criticised from the alternative point of departure. Decisions based on retrospective LCA can have environmentally undesirable consequences. On the other hand, prospective LCA can appear unfair and result in environmentally sub-optimised systems. Both types of LCA also have methodological limitations. We cannot conclude that one type is superior to the other, but the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>methodology</b> should be consistent with the information sought in the LCA...|$|E
