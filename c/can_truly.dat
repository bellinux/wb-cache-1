5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most common {{objections}} to evolution dispute whether evolution <b>can</b> <b>truly</b> account for all the apparent complexity and order in the natural world. It is argued that evolution is too unlikely or otherwise lacking to account for various aspects of life, and therefore that an intelligence, such as God of the Abrahamic religions, must at the very least be appealed to for those specific features.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals that <b>can</b> <b>truly</b> fly. They fly through the air at a {{constant}} speed by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping {{the body in the}} air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, he {{starred in}} {{supporting}} roles in Year of the Dog and Rendition. Year of the Dog {{is a dark}} comedy about a lonely middle-aged woman, played by Molly Shannon, who finds that animals are the only beings she <b>can</b> <b>truly</b> rely on. Sarsgaard plays Newt, an androgynous dog trainer, and love interest for Shannon's character. He starred alongside Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin, Reese Witherspoon, and Jake Gyllenhaal in Rendition, a Gavin Hood-directed political thriller about the US policy of extraordinary rendition. Viewed as a sex symbol, Sarsgaard was named one of Salon.com's Sexiest Man Living in 2007. 2008 saw Sarsgaard star in the drama Elegy, based on a Phillip Roth novel, The Dying Animal. The film received favorable good reception amongst critics.|$|E

25|$|There is {{emerging}} evidence {{from studies of}} cord bloods that both sensitization and the acquisition of tolerance can begin in pregnancy, however the window of main danger for sensitization to foods extends prenatally, remaining most critical during early infancy when {{the immune system and}} intestinal tract are still maturing. There is no conclusive evidence to support the restriction of dairy intake in the maternal diet during pregnancy in order to prevent. This is generally not recommended since the drawbacks in terms of loss of nutrition can out-weigh the benefits. However, further randomised, controlled trials are required to examine if dietary exclusion by lactating mothers <b>can</b> <b>truly</b> minimize risk to a significant degree and if any reduction in risk is out-weighed by deleterious impacts on maternal nutrition.|$|E
25|$|The lovers, at last {{alone and}} {{freed from the}} {{constraints}} of courtly life, declare their passion for each other. Tristan decries the realm of daylight which is false, unreal, and keeps them apart. It is only in night, he claims, that they <b>can</b> <b>truly</b> be together and only in the long night of death can they be eternally united ("O sink' hernieder, Nacht der Liebe"). During their long tryst, Brangäne calls a warning several times that the night is ending ("Einsam wachend in der Nacht"), but her cries fall upon deaf ears. The day breaks in on the lovers as Melot leads King Marke and his men to find Tristan and Isolde in each other's arms. Marke is heartbroken, {{not only because of}} his nephew's betrayal but also because Melot chose to betray his friend Tristan to Marke and because of Isolde's betrayal as well ("Mir – dies? Dies, Tristan – mir?").|$|E

25|$|Recent {{research}} {{reveals a}} potential taste receptor called the CD36 receptor. CD36 was targeted {{as a possible}} lipid taste receptor because it binds to fat molecules (more specifically, long-chain fatty acids), {{and it has been}} localized to taste bud cells (specifically, the circumvallate and foliate papillae). There is a debate over whether we <b>can</b> <b>truly</b> taste fats, and supporters of our ability to taste free fatty acids (FFAs) have based the argument on a few main points: there is an evolutionary advantage to oral fat detection; a potential fat receptor has been located on taste bud cells; fatty acids evoke specific responses that activate gustatory neurons, similar to other currently accepted tastes; and, there is a physiological response to the presence of oral fat. Although CD36 has been studied primarily in mice, research examining human subjects' ability to taste fats found that those with high levels of CD36 expression were more sensitive to tasting fat than were those with low levels of CD36 expression; this study points to a clear association between CD36 receptor quantity and the ability to taste fat.|$|E
25|$|In Fall 2008, Northwestern {{opened a}} campus in Education City, Doha, Qatar, joining five other American universities: Carnegie Mellon University, Cornell University, Georgetown University, Texas A University, and Virginia Commonwealth University. Through the Medill School of Journalism and School of Communication, NU-Q offers bachelor's degrees in journalism and {{communication}} respectively. However, some have questioned whether NU-Q <b>can</b> <b>truly</b> offer a comparable journalism program {{to that of}} its U.S. campus given Qatar’s strict limits on journalistic and academic freedoms and instances of censorship. The Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development, a private charitable institution started by former emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani {{and his wife and}} mother of the current emir Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, provided funding for construction and administrative costs as well as support to hire 50 to 60 faculty and staff, some of whom rotate between the Evanston and Qatar campuses. Northwestern receives about $45 million per year to operate the campus. In February 2016, Northwestern reached an agreement with the Qatar Foundation to extend the operations of the NU-Q branch for an additional decade, through the 2027-2028 academic year. As with other universities with campuses in Doha, Northwestern has received criticism for accepting money from a country that supports terrorism and has a poor human rights record.|$|E
