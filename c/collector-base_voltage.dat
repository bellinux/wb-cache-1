The {{result is that the}} transistor makes a good switch that is controlled by its base input.

50|$|A speedy {{switching}} device is an NPN avalanche transistor {{fitted with a}} coil between base and emitter. The transistor is initially switched off and about 300 volts exists across its <b>collector-base</b> junction. This <b>voltage</b> is high enough that a charge carrier in this region can create more carriers by impact ionisation, but the probability is too low to form a proper avalanche; instead a somewhat noisy leakage current flows. When the preceding stage switches, the emitter-base junction is pushed into forward bias and the collector-base junction enters full avalanche mode, so charge carriers injected into the collector-base region multiply in a chain reaction. Once the Marx generator has completely fired, voltages everywhere drop, each switch avalanche stops, its matched coil puts its base-emitter junction into reverse bias, and the low static field allows remaining charge carriers to drain out of its collector-base junction.|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} bipolar {{current mirror}} (shown in Figure 1) implements this idea. It {{consists of two}} cascaded transistor stages acting accordingly as a reversed and direct voltage-to-current converters. The emitter of transistor Q1 is connected to ground. Its <b>collector-base</b> <b>voltage</b> is zero as shown. Consequently, the voltage drop across Q1 is VBE, that is, this voltage is set by the diode law and Q1 {{is said to be}} diode connected. (See also Ebers-Moll model.) It is important to have Q1 in the circuit instead of a simple diode, because Q1 sets VBE for transistor Q2. If Q1 and Q2 are matched, that is, have substantially the same device properties, and if the mirror output voltage is chosen so the <b>collector-base</b> <b>voltage</b> of Q2 is also zero, then the VBE-value set by Q1 results in an emitter current in the matched Q2 that {{is the same as the}} emitter current in Q1. Because Q1 and Q2 are matched, their β0-values also agree, making the mirror output current the same as the collector current of Q1.|$|E
50|$|To {{design the}} mirror, the output current must {{be related to}} the two {{resistor}} values R1 and R2. A basic observation is that the output transistor is in active mode only so long as its <b>collector-base</b> <b>voltage</b> is non-zero. Thus, the simplest bias condition for design of the mirror sets the applied voltage VA to equal the base voltage VB. This minimum useful value of VA is called the compliance voltage of the current source. With that bias condition, the Early effect plays no role in the design.|$|E

These phenomena can be characterized by extracting the M - 1 coefficient, which can be evaluated by measuring base current changes. Measurements of M - 1 are affected at low current densities {{by the presence of}} the collector-base junction reverse current I(CBO). At high current densities, three effects contribute to lower the measured M - 1 value: voltage drops due to R(C) and R(B) parasitic resistances, device self-heating, and lowering of the base-collector junction electric field due to mobile carriers.

40|$|The {{vertical}} transport of nonequilibrium charge carriers through semiconductor heterostructures {{has led to}} milestones in electronics {{with the development of}} the hot-electron transistor. Recently, significant advances have been made with atomically sharp heterostructures implementing various two-dimensional materials. Although graphene-base hot-electron transistors show great promise for electronic switching at high frequencies, they are limited by their low current gain. Here we show that, by choosing MoS 2 and HfO 2 for the filter barrier interface and using a noncrystalline semiconductor such as ITO for the collector, we can achieve an unprecedentedly high-current gain (α ∼ 0. 95) in our hot-electron transistors operating at room temperature. Furthermore, the current gain can be tuned over 2 orders of magnitude with the <b>collector-base</b> <b>voltage</b> albeit this feature currently presents a drawback in the transistor performance metrics such as poor output resistance and poor intrinsic voltage gain.

40|$|To realize optimum performance, SiGe HBTs are {{typically}} designed with heavily doped implanted collectors. For practical circuits operating at either high collector current density (Jc) or high <b>collector-base</b> <b>voltage</b> (Vcb) avalanche multiplication {{is an important}} effects that must be accurately measured and modeled. For example in digital applications, the avalanche multiplication factor (M- 1) determines the breakdown voltage, which in turn determines the maximum power supply for stable logic operation. In critical RF circuits such as power amplifiers (PA) and low noise amplifiers (LNA), the base-collector junction avalanche multiplication degrades the linearity of the circuit because of the resulting strong non-linear feedback from the output (collector) to input (base) is particularly the case for state-of-art high-performance transistors featuring high collector doping. Therefore the accuracy of avalanche multiplication models in different operational conditions is critical to devices design of high linearity LNA and PA circuits. In this thesis, the temperature dependence of the avalanche current in Mextram compact model is addressed through extensive DC measurements over temperature on advanced industrial SiGe HBTs, {{it was discovered that}} the current local-electric field based avalanche current model in the Mextram model is incapable of describing the avalanche current as a function of device temperature. This setback is the key motivation behind the work in this thesis. By employing the simplified energy-balance equation, the impact ionization rate was expressed in terms of the carrier (electron for NPN HBT) energy or temperature (Te). Here a triangular shaped electric field distribution corresponding to the normal forward operation regime was assumed. Taking the integral of the electron temperature dependent ionization rate over the epilayer yielded the non-local multiplication factor. The product of the multiplication factor with epilayer current gives the non-local avalanche current, which takes non-local avalanche effects into account. The compact formulation of this non-local avalanche current model was derived and implemented at Delft University of Technology in the in-house version of Mextram compact model. An extended experimental verification of the new compact model for the non-local avalanche current implemented in Mextram was carried out for different advanced SiGe HBT technologies; and the results are presented in this thesis. Verification results showed that the non-local avalanche current model can accurately describe the avalanche current as a function of temperature for different SiGe HBTs (both NPN and PNP). These results implies that the observed setback in Mextram model with respect to the temperature dependence of the avalanche current can be fully addressed by taking non-local avalanche effects into account.
