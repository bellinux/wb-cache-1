5|$|Genjurō is {{visited by}} a noblewoman and her female servant, who order several pieces of pottery {{and tell him}} to take them to the Kutsuki mansion. Genjurō learns that Nobunaga's {{soldiers}} have attacked the manor and killed all who lived there, except Lady Wakasa and her servant. He also learns that Lady Wakasa's father haunts the manor. Genjurō is seduced by Lady Wakasa, and she convinces him to marry her. Meanwhile, Nakanogō is under attack. Miyagi and her son hide from soldiers and are found by an elderly woman who hurries them to safety. In the woods, several soldiers desperately search her for food. She fights with the soldiers and is stabbed. She collapses with her son still <b>clutching</b> <b>her</b> back.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{also used}} the data to reveal details about the {{technique}} used and to predict that the painting will degrade very little if current conservation techniques are continued. During 2006, Mona Lisa underwent a major scientific observation that proved through infrared cameras she was originally wearing a bonnet and <b>clutching</b> <b>her</b> chair, something that da Vinci decided to change as an afterthought.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, Beaton {{was first}} posted to the Ministry of Information {{and given the}} task of {{recording}} images from the home front. During this assignment he captured {{one of the most}} enduring images of British suffering during the war, that of 3-year-old Blitz victim Eileen Dunne recovering in hospital, <b>clutching</b> <b>her</b> beloved teddy bear. When the image was published, America had not yet officially joined the war, but images such as Beaton’s helped push the Americans to put pressure on their government to help Britain in its hour of need.|$|E

25|$|In 1838 Delacroix {{exhibited}} Medea {{about to}} Kill Her Children, which created a sensation at the Salon. His first large-scale {{treatment of a}} scene from Greek mythology, the painting depicts Medea <b>clutching</b> <b>her</b> children, dagger drawn to slay them in vengeance for her abandonment by Jason. The three nude figures form an animated pyramid, bathed in a raking light which penetrates the grotto in which Medea has hidden. Though the painting was quickly purchased by the State, Delacroix was disappointed when it {{was sent to the}} Lille Musée des Beaux-Arts; he had intended for it to hang at the Luxembourg, where it would have joined The Barque of Dante and Scenes from the Massacres of Chios.|$|E
25|$|The Papillon's {{history and}} long {{association}} with royalty {{have led to}} many stories about the breed. Marie Antoinette {{is said to have}} walked to the guillotine <b>clutching</b> <b>her</b> small dog under her arm, likely an apocryphal tale. However, tradition has it that Marie Antoinette's dog was a small spaniel that had been brought to the French court from Spain on the back of pack mules. According to the story, her pup was spared and cared for in a building in Paris still called the Papillon House. Marie Antoinette's dog was said to have descended from a very old drop-eared breed known as the Epagneul Nain, or Continental Dwarf/Toy Spaniel that appeared in church frescos and paintings as early as the 13th century.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, Maria's second son, George, died of {{tuberculosis}} in the Caucasus. During the funeral, {{she kept her}} composure, {{but at the end}} of the service, she ran from the church <b>clutching</b> <b>her</b> son's top hat that been atop the coffin and collapsed in her carriage sobbing. Two years later, according to her daughter, Grand Duchess Olga, she arranged Olga's disastrous marriage to Peter, Duke of Oldenburg. For years Nicholas refused to grant his unhappy sister a divorce, only relenting in 1916 in the midst of the War. When Olga attempted to contract a morganatic marriage with Nikolai Kulikovsky, Maria Feodorovna and the tsar tried to dissuade her, yet, they did not protest too vehemently. Indeed, Maria Feodorovna was one of the few people who attended the wedding in November 1916. In 1912, Maria faced trouble with her youngest son, when he secretly married his mistress, much to the outrage and scandal of both Maria Feodorovna and Nicholas.|$|E

25|$|Charles Cortimiglia was an {{immigrant}} {{who lived with}} his wife and baby on the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Second Street in Gretna, Louisiana, a New Orleans suburb, across the Mississippi River. On the night of March 10, 1919, screams were heard coming from the Cortimiglia Residence. Grocer Iorlando Jordano rushed across the street to investigate. Upon his arrival, Jordano noticed that Charles Cortimiglia, his wife Rosie, and their infant daughter, Mary, had all been attacked by the unknown intruder. Rosie stood in the doorway with a serious head wound, <b>clutching</b> <b>her</b> deceased daughter. Charles laid on the floor, bleeding profusely. The couple was rushed to Charity Hospital, where it was discovered that both had suffered skull fractures. Nothing was stolen from the house, but a panel on the back door had been chiseled away. A bloody axe was found on the back porch of the home. Charles was released two days later, while his wife remained in the care of doctors. Upon gaining full consciousness, Rosie made claims that Iorlando Jordano and his 18-year-old son, Frank, were responsible for the attacks. Iorlando, a 69-year-old man, was in too poor of health to have committed the crimes. Frank Jordano, more than six feet tall and weighing over 200 pounds, would have been too large to have fit through the panel on the back door. Charles Cortimiglia vehemently denied his wife's claims, yet police nonetheless arrested the two, and charged them with the murder. The men would later be found guilty. Frank was sentenced to hang, and his father to life in prison. Charles Cortimiglia divorced his wife after the trial. Almost a year later, Rosie announced that she had falsely accused the two out of jealousy and spite. Her statement was the only evidence against the Jordanos, and they were released from jail shortly thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have noticed}} that the {{mechanics}} of the game — the actions available to the player, and the responses resulting from said actions — contrast pointedly with many mechanics of popular FPS games, and that the game deliberately used shooter genre clichés in order to illustrate how ludicrous they are in comparison to real warfare. In particular, unlike other games of its kind, some critics believe that Spec Ops: The Line does not intend the combat to be a fun experience for the player, but rather aims to engage the player by critiquing the shooter genre for being removed from reality and providing players with an unrealistic, morally dichotomous, escapist fantasy. The scene depicting the use of white phosphorus {{has been the subject of}} much scrutiny due to imagery that includes the corpse of a mother <b>clutching</b> <b>her</b> child, and was described as [...] "troubling". In response to complaints that the massacre was unnecessary or exploitative, Williams justified the scene by saying that the plot device was intended to evoke players' anger, and that a valid way to end the game is simply for the player to put the controller down and stop playing.|$|E
500|$|At {{the motel}} room, Selena and Saldívar began arguing. Motel guests complained about loud noises coming from Saldívar's room. They said they heard two women arguing about {{business}} matters. Selena told Saldívar {{she could no}} longer be trusted, and demanded Saldívar return her financial papers. Selena then dumped Saldívar's satchel containing bank statements onto the bed and saw the gun. At 11:48a.m. (CST), Saldívar pointed it at Selena. As Selena tried to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the lower right shoulder, severing an artery and causing a massive loss of blood. Trinidad Espinoza, the hotel's maintenance man, reported hearing a [...] "loud bang", which he likened to a car engine misfiring. Selena was critically wounded; she ran towards the lobby, leaving a trail of blood [...] long. She was seen <b>clutching</b> <b>her</b> chest screaming, [...] "Help me! Help me! I've been shot!"; Saldívar was still chasing after her, pointing the gun at her, and calling her a [...] "bitch". According to Carlos Morales, who was waiting outside the motel, he heard screaming and saw Selena running towards him. She grabbed Morales and screamed, [...] "they'll shoot me again". Selena collapsed on the floor at 11:49a.m. (CST) as hotel general manager Barbara Schultz telephoned the emergency services. The singer identified Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot. Shawna Vela and hotel sales manager Ruben DeLeon tried to stop the flow of blood. Selena's condition began to deteriorate rapidly as motel staff attended to her. Selena screamed at the staff, telling them, [...] "lock the door, she'll shoot me again". DeLeon tried to talk to Selena but noticed she was beginning to lose consciousness; he said she was moaning and moving less often. DeLeon noticed Selena's eyes had rolled back and that she went limp.|$|E

2500|$|The Rangers began {{questioning}} the woman fleeing with Nocona and other surviving Comanches for signs {{that she was}} Cynthia. When Ross arrived back at the campground, he discovered that she had blue eyes. He assured her that no young boys {{had been killed in}} the battle, so her sons, Quanah and Pecos, were safe. At last, <b>clutching</b> <b>her</b> two-year-old daughter, Topʉsana, [...] in broken English she identified herself and her family name. Her information matched what Ross knew of the 1836 Fort Parker Massacre.|$|E
2500|$|The actress Anna Wing, {{who was now}} 70 {{years old}} and had been acting since the late 1930s, {{audition}}ed for the role. She was so keen to play the part that she turned up for the audition <b>clutching</b> <b>her</b> birth certificate to prove she was a Hackney greengrocer's daughter and implored the producers to give her the job. When she first read for the part Holland and Smith felt that [...] "she overacted terribly", but on the second reading she [...] "brought the performance down considerably". There were initial fears over whether an actress of her age would have the stamina to survive EastEnders gruelling schedule, but when asked if she'd like to be in a popular soap, Wing replied [...] "All my life I've been an actress, now I want to be a household name!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1944 Neill {{commenced}} {{a series}} of cartoons for the Glasgow Evening Times, themed around Glasgow life. His wry observational humour focussed on local wartime attitudes, and plundered the rich resource of the Glasgow vernacular. They frequently featured [...] "wee wifies", in the early cartoons gossiping about the war ("They tell me yon yin Hitler's a richt bad rascal an' a'...") and victory ("if ye ask me, they'll never catch him. He'll tak' yin o' his Luftwuffy airyplanes and scram tae Thibet or Edinbury.."). In later cartoons they discussed their wean (one <b>clutching</b> <b>her</b> girning [...] baby says [...] "It's his teeth, aye. Awfy crabbit. Like a bear wi' nae fags." [...] ) and went [...] "doon the watter" [...] on Clyde steamers for their holidays: one irritating a smartly dressed man in yachting blazer and officer's cap by quizzing him [...] "Yaffayat?

Because she is gifted with extra sensory abilities, she was involved in a project at the Oceania Marine Development center. After the Zorndyke conflict began, Yamada saw her talent and had her join the Blue Fleet. Despite Huang's remarkable skills, she is still quite young and very emotionally frail, often time she's seen <b>clutching</b> <b>her</b> stuffed bear and is very disturbed by all the death that occurs during battle. She dislikes any kind of conflict and feels burdened by her psychic abilities.|$|E
