40|$|Background: The {{deterioration}} in lung function associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) {{is directly related}} to duration of smoking and the number of <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked.</b> Over 85 % of lung cancers are attributed to smoking. The problem is, whether the length of smoking consumption period has more impact to COPD and lung cancer than the bigger number of <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> per day?Examinees and methods: The sample has constituted of two groups of examinees, smokers, both gender, age 25 - 64 years old. The first group consisted of 240 examinees divided in 8 subgroups according to a number of years they have been smoking. The second group consisted of 180 examinees, which was divided in 6 subgroups, according to average number of <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> daily during the smoking consumption period. Results: The prevalence of smoking was higher in men (65. 7 % vs. 62 %) than in women (34. 3 % vs. 38 %). Smoking duration in the group of smokers according to the length of smoking consumption period was 20. 34 ± 10. 63 y and in the group of smokers according to a number of <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> daily 13. 55 ± 8. 20 y. COPD were registered as the most frequent lung disease, in the group of smokers according to a number of <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> per day 52. 2 % and in the group according to the length of smoking consumption period 39. 1 %, and the middle values of FEV 1 (82. 77 % vs. 97. 64 %), and FEV 1 /FVC (86. 02 % vs. 97. 73 %) were lower in the group of smokers according to a number of <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked.</b> Conclusion: Chronic respiratory symptoms, impairment of lung function and diagnosis of COPD depended more on the length of smoking duration than a number of <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cotinine {{concentration}} in various body fluids {{is considered to}} be among the most useful markers of nicotine exposure currently available. Despite the prevailing consensus concerning cotinine's usefulness, cotinine's large intrasubject variability has led some to question the value of a single-point measurement. Several individual differences (for example, age, race, sex, and so forth) may affect cotinine excretion, and a peculiar nonlinearity between the number of <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> and cotinine concentration has been reported previously in the literature. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the nature of the association between cotinine and reported number of <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> after adjustment for the relationship between cotinine and age, a key individual difference known to affect drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and tissue sensitivity. The authors examined the relationship between saliva cotinine and daily cigarette consumption in 116 smokers (mean age = 37. 4 years; average number of <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> daily = 20. 1) who logged each cigarette into a hand-held computer as part of a study on the accuracy of recall. The Pearson correlation between saliva cotinine and the logged number of <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> in the previous 17 hours (the time window corresponding to the half-life of cotinine) accounted for significantly more of the variance in cotinine than did the average logged number of <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> daily during 5 days. Age was also significantly associated with cotinine levels. Further examination of the relationship between cotinine and amount smoked in the previous 17 hours revealed evidence for a significant nonlinear component. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

25|$|Acrolein is a {{pyrolysis}} {{product that is}} abundant in <b>cigarette</b> <b>smoke.</b> It gives smoke an acrid smell and an irritating, lachrymatory effect and is {{a major contributor to}} its carcinogenicity. Like PAH metabolites, acrolein is also an electrophilic alkylating agent and permanently binds to the DNA base guanine, by a conjugate addition followed by cyclization into a hemiaminal. The acrolein-guanine adduct induces mutations during DNA copying and thus causes cancers {{in a manner similar to}} PAHs. However, acrolein is 1000 times more abundant than PAHs in <b>cigarette</b> <b>smoke</b> and is able to react as is, without metabolic activation. Acrolein has been shown to be a mutagen and carcinogen in human cells. The carcinogenicity of acrolein has been difficult to study by animal experimentation, because it has such a toxicity that it tends to kill the animals before they develop cancer. Generally, compounds able to react by conjugate addition as electrophiles (so-called Michael acceptors after Michael reaction) are toxic and carcinogenic, because they can permanently alkylate DNA, similarly to mustard gas or aflatoxin. Acrolein is only one of them present in cigarette smoke; for example, crotonaldehyde has been found in <b>cigarette</b> <b>smoke.</b> Michael acceptors also contribute to the chronic inflammation present in tobacco disease.|$|E
