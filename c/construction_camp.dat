5|$|The {{construction}} workers (who reached {{a peak of}} 44,900 in June 1944) lived in a <b>construction</b> <b>camp</b> near the old Hanford townsite. The administrators and engineers lived in the government town established at Richland Village, which eventually had accommodation in 4,300 family units and 25 dormitories.|$|E
5|$|The dispute did not delay work. Although {{progress}} on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict {{the scope of the}} project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the <b>construction</b> <b>camp.</b> As area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site. At its peak, the <b>construction</b> <b>camp</b> was the third most populous town in Washington state. Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago. Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a gated community with restricted access, but it looked more like a typical wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and physical security elements like high fences, towers, and guard dogs were less evident.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1975, Alyeska {{terminated}} Ketchbaw's {{contract and}} took responsibility for analyzing weld X-Rays itself. The controversy continued, however, as Kelley's lawsuit moved forward, a Ketchbaw manager was found dead of cyanide poisoning, and photographs of welds {{were stolen from a}} pump station <b>construction</b> <b>camp.</b> Alyeska began a review of all 30,800 welds that had been done in 1975, and submitted its report to the Interior Department in April 1976. In May, it submitted its technical analysis and a report on repair work under way. The review produced a list of 3,955 questionable welds—10 percent of 1975's work.|$|E

Alyeska planned for 29 <b>construction</b> <b>camps,</b> but 31 were created. Seven were built along the pipeline south of the Yukon, and one was built at each of the 12 pump stations along the length of the route.|$|R
25|$|Excavation {{and primary}} {{concrete}} for the dam, powerhouse and spillway was mainly completed by June 2009. The spillway gate hoist housing had been erected {{and the river}} closure and diversion occurred in July 2009. Construction required an access road and <b>construction</b> <b>camp</b> site, and a construction power substation, along with services such as water supply and sewage lagoons for the camp. A new 230 kV gas-insulated substation was constructed adjacent to the dam site, which will distribute power from the Wuskwatim generators to the transmission network. A cofferdam was constructed for excavation of the tailrace and spillway channel, and subsequently removed. Secondary concrete and turbine installation continued through {{the summer and fall}} of 2010. The <b>construction</b> <b>camp</b> population varies according to activity level but as of July 2010 there were 635 workers in the <b>construction</b> <b>camp.</b>|$|E

25|$|Montana Power resumed {{building}} the structure in March 1916. The reason for resuming construction was to supply {{power to the}} Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railway and the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad. The Chas. T. Main company (whose Western Office was in Butte, Montana) was hired to revisit the design. Henry A. Herrick, {{an employee of the}} power company, was the consulting engineer for Main. The major change implemented by Main and Herrick was to install vertical rather than horizontal turbines, although some changes were made to the wastewater system and the dam's downstream face. Stone & Webster continued to be the construction company, and more than 500 men worked on the project. The S. Morgan Smith Company of York, Pennsylvania, designed the water wheels for the turbines. The 1916-1918 <b>construction</b> <b>camp</b> was the largest ever built by Montana Power. There were more than 115 buildings at the construction site, including a bunkhouse and dormitories for unmarried men, cottages for married men, a dining hall, a bathing house, storage sheds, garages, a photography studio, school, hospital, and sewer. Although most of the structures were tents or wooden buildings intended for short-term use, seven of the structures were renovated into permanent housing for the dam's operators. Two more homes were built for operators after construction ended. Montana Power spent $1.3 million in 1916 and $1.5 million in 1917 to finish the dam. Holter was completed and brought online for power generation in 1918. It was the sixth and last dam completed by the company in that decade.|$|E

500|$|In 1922, the Reclamation Service {{presented}} a report {{calling for the}} development of a dam on the Colorado River for flood control and electric power generation. The report was principally authored by Davis, and was called the Fall-Davis report after Interior Secretary Albert Fall. The Fall-Davis report cited use of the Colorado River as a federal concern, because the river's basin covered several states, and the river eventually entered Mexico. Though the Fall-Davis report called for a dam [...] "at or near Boulder Canyon", the Reclamation Service (which was renamed the Bureau of Reclamation the following year) found that canyon unsuitable. One potential site at Boulder Canyon was bisected by a geologic fault; two others were so narrow there was no space for a <b>construction</b> <b>camp</b> at the bottom of the canyon or for a spillway. The Service investigated Black Canyon and found it ideal; a railway could be laid from the railhead in Las Vegas to the top of the dam site. Despite the site change, the dam project was referred to as the [...] "Boulder Canyon Project".|$|E

50|$|Halford {{resigned}} his bishopric in Rockhampton in 1920 {{to establish}} the Order of Witness, which was a radical experiment within the Anglican church extension movement of the interwar period. Seeking to reach {{the men in the}} railway <b>construction</b> <b>camps</b> and mining camps, and the struggling families in the new soldier and immigrant settlements, Bishop Halford established an order of priests who lived very simply and were prepared to be sent anywhere a parish priest could not normally minister, living in the mining and <b>construction</b> <b>camps,</b> and bearing personal witness to their faith. To support their work, the Order obtained in 1922-23 a small farm adjoining Christ Church, Tingalpa. The farmhouse became their Priory, and the ancient and historic little Tingalpa Church became their chapel.|$|R

It took only [...] "one short day" [...] to get from Duluth to Two Harbors. By 1886 the D completed the Lake Division connecting Duluth and Two Harbors with passenger service that extended to Ely MN. Thirty five logging camps were set up within the vicinity, one of these located on Fourth Avenue. On February 26, 1907, the village reincorporated as the City of Two Harbors.|$|E

2500|$|Homestead was {{incorporated}} in 1913 {{and is the}} second oldest city in Miami-Dade County next {{to the city of}} Miami. It is located approximately [...] southwest of Miami, and [...] northwest of Key Largo. The name originates from when the Florida East Coast Railway extension to Key West was being built. The rail line was passing through an area opened up for homesteading, and as the <b>construction</b> <b>camp</b> {{at the end of the}} line did not have a particular name, construction materials and supplies for the workers were consigned to [...] "Homestead Country", shortened to [...] "Homestead" [...] by the engineers who mapped the area.

2500|$|Beginning in 1921, the Los Angeles County Fire Department began a county-wide {{program of}} {{building}} fire breaks (or more properly, fuel breaks) {{to slow the}} spread of fire, and by 1923 the initial breaks had been constructed in the Verdugos. In 1934, the City of Glendale built a 60-foot lookout tower on Verdugo Peak, which was staffed with an observer until it closed in the mid-1950s. In order to conduct the work necessary to build fire breaks and roads, temporary construction camps were located throughout the fire-prone areas of the county.
