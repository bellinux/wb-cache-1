40|$|The power {{markets in}} Europe are {{changing}} rapidly. The drastic shift towards renewable energy and interconnection between power markets has {{brought with it}} challenges related to power balance and grid stability. Consumption and generation of electric power needs to be at balance at all times and a secure and reliable power system requires sensitivity to multiple time scales. Increased demand for balancing energy and ancillary services {{has the potential of}} making pump storage projects in Norway more profitable. Hydro Energy is evaluating the potential of building a pump storage power plant in the existing Fortun power system in western Norway. This study aims to quantify the income potential when co-optimizing operation in the wholesale electricity market and balancing markets with three different technical design alternatives offering different degree of operation flexibility. Alternative 1 is based on the license application for the project. The fixed speed pump is a reversible Francis turbine with an installed capacity of 39 MW in pumping mode and 48 MW in turbine mode. The second alternative, Alternative 2, is similar to Alternative 1 only it is equipped with a variable speed pump. Alternative 3 has increased production and pumping capacity as well as a variable speed pump. Investment cost of the three alternatives range from 610 <b>mill</b> <b>NOK</b> to 700 <b>mill</b> <b>NOK.</b> The markets considered are FCR day option, the RK market and the spot market. A price scenario for the spot market, FCR market and the RK market are developed. The price scenario is based on assumptions for future demand of balancing power. Power plant operation strategy is chosen based on the hydrological data and a seasonal pumping cycle is considered the best alternative. Income is estimated in respect to historical prices and scenario prices. The ongoing changes in the power market would potentially be a game changer for profitability of pump storage hydropower in Norway and should be considered for investment decisions. The investment analysis of the three technical alternatives shows that ability to participate in balancing markets has the potential to increase potential income significantly. Only Alternative 2 and 3 are considered economic feasible given that 80 - 100 % of the income potential is obtained. Profitability of the projects increase when income estimation is done based on scenario prices. Based on the assumptions and method of this study Alternative 2 is considered the best alternative for Illvatn pump storage project based on investment analysis. ...|$|R

This note briefly discusses the background for the Norwegian support to this sector, describes the nature of the Norwegian aid, and reports some of the results that have been achieved. This is not an evaluation report. This note is written as part of an internal NORAD project focussing on results management in development cooperation in general. The aim of the project is to improve NORAD’s communication of results, in order to both enhance learning and to be better able to communicate results to the general public in Norway. Part of the project consisted of a field-visit to Uganda in January/February 2003, where the reporting systems related to the Norwegian support in the electricity sector were used as a case-study. Although the focus of the team was primarily with the systems of results management as such, an inevitable by-product was to gain insights into the actual achievements in this area of support.

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{power demand}} and a transition towards more {{renewable energy sources}} have led to an increasing development of wind farms. Wind farms produce unregulated power {{which may not be}} available when it is needed. Pumped storage power plants can have a stabilizing effect of the power grid as well as increase the utilization of the wind power by using surplus power to store water and produce power from this water when needed. The two lakes Ytter-Bangsj&# 248;en and Sn&# 229;savatnet is suited for a pumped storage power plant. With the construction of a 1 km low dam the magazine capacity is increased to 260 mill m 3 and a head of 296. 8 m. The water tunnels that&# 146;s need constructing will have a total length of 6. 5 km which because of good rock quality and topography can be unlined. A review of the topographic and geological conditions was done for the area, and the underground elements was located and orientated on basis of these findings in the area. The headrace and tailrace tunnel was optimized towards an economical optimum, based on net present value and given values for the power price. The selected tunnel profile and the power cavern were simulated with the finite element software Phase 2 to investigate the stability of the openings. Results showed that only a 70 m stretch of limestone needs support. The construction costs was calculated using NVE cost base for hydropower plants and gave a cost of 1122 <b>mill</b> <b>NOK.</b> For calculating profitability a series of sale power prices was set, and for each value a corresponding maximum buy price that gave a positive NPV was found. The result gave an equation that found the price variation in the power market to be too small for the project to be profitable from operating solely on the power market, and should rely on buying surplus wind power. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{in this project}} is to find an {{economic}} and profitable technology for production of '"tasteless·· fish proteins from salmon backbones. Two possible sources/technologies for {{the isolation of the}} proteins are evaluated in the project: the solid phase from salmon oil production and a process with cooking of salmon backbones before bone separation. The process where the salmon backbones were cooked before separation (the continuous cooker process) gave the highest product yield. In {{order to be able to}} produce tasteless fish proteins with a low amount of lipids, the applied shear forces should be reduced to a minimum throughout the process, as this will make the removal of lipid more efficient. Preliminary sensory analyses show that the produced fish proteins powders taste intensity is in the same range as that of soya isolates, a common commercial product, sold in large volumes. However, taste panellists usually recognize Fish proteins to be fish. Therefore, the use of masking taste compounds could be evaluated. Preliminary sensory results also indicated that taste of the protein powders was not affected by the amount of lipids in the studied samples. This is an important finding, since it opens the door for a simpler, more cost effective process. The type of meat, red or whole meat, used for isolation of proteins could not be distinguished by sensory panellists. Further work should clarify the importance of the lipid content and the stability of these protein powders. A preliminary economic analysis of the two processes shows that the band cooking process has the highest potential to succeed due to higher yield of protein from the back bones. Based on a raw material price on 2 NOK/kg, crude marine oil NOK 4 /kg and on 80 NOK/kg for produced protein powder ethanol extracted protein powder give a net cash flow of 0. 78 mill NDK for a process based on roughly 2000 tons/year of salmon backbones. If ethanol extraction can be omitted the net cash flow is 12 <b>mill</b> <b>NOK.</b> A further stability test on the produced protein powders with accompanying sensory tests are recommended, such study could indicate the potential marked segments for these products...|$|R

40|$|To {{increase}} {{organic production}} and achieve the official aims, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (until 2004 : the Ministry of Agriculture) {{has developed a}} national policy specifically targeting organic farming. This is described in the action plan Prioritised Areas within the Food- and Agricultural Research, which {{is linked to the}} White Paper of 1999. Organic farming is one out of seven topics to be prioritised for research funding. For this farming method, the Ministry considers the following needs to be of greatest importance: To reduce various biological and economical risks linked to production; to increase the diversity and quality of organic products in the market and the general knowledge of organic markets and consumers; and to increase the knowledge of the whole value chain from production via processing to distribution of organic produce. An Action Plan for Organic Production and Sales launched by the Norwegian Agricultural Authority (SLF) in 2000, and revised in 2003, states that a range of organisations and stakeholders should feel responsible for contributing towards reaching the official aims. The RCN should have a coordinating role and cover all areas of organic research. Over the years, the main funding sources for OF&F research (the RCN, AA-funding and Levy funding, see Chapter 4) have become increasingly coordinated. For all research projects funded by these bodies, the RCN is responsible for the proposal procedures and quality control. However, the use of funds is decided upon by discussions between the individual funding boards. The funding for a specific project is often composed of contributions from more than one funding body. In later years, the government has paid more attention and devoted relatively more resources to OF&F development projects than to research projects. Market development has been regarded as the crucial task, in order to increase the demand for organic products. The Norwegian Agricultural Authority (SLF) administrates approx. € 5 million per year of public funding for development projects within the OF&F sector (38 <b>mill.</b> <b>NOK</b> in 2005 and 2006). SLF projects are not described in this report. It is challenging to draw a clear line between OF&F development and research projects, but in this report we have chosen to define OF&F research projects as the projects funded by the three funding bodies mentioned above (the RCN, AA-funding and Levy funding). Norway is a large country with a small and scattered population (4. 4 million). The regional research within OF&F is usually of limited scientific value at an international level. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This master {{thesis is}} a part of the project initialised by the Ministry of Health and Care Services in order to {{evaluate}} the effects of the transfer of financial responsibility to the Regional Health Authorities. The scope and the main topic for the project were sat by Stortingsproposisjon nr. 1 (2008 - 2009) (St. prp. nr. 1 2008 - 2009, kap. 732, postene 72 - 75). This paper concentrates on evaluation of the reform s effects on price and competition in the market for TNF-α inhibitors and other biological anti-inflammatory medicines (six biopharmaceuticals all together). TNF-α inhibitors and other biological anti-inflammatory medicines, belonging to the group of antineoplastic and immunomodulating medicines, have had a quite expansive sales growth during the past decade. In the specific period of time from 2003 until 2008 the total sales increased from 300 <b>mills</b> <b>NOK</b> to almost 1, 24 billion NOK. This expansion triggered for the strict cost containment governmental efforts and the financing reform of 2006. Before 01. 06. 2006 the use of these medicines was financed asymmetrically, both by the National Insurance Scheme (Folketrygden) and the Regional Health Authorities (RHF). After the funding reform (from 01. 06. 2006) all the treatment with TNF-α inhibitors and other biological anti-inflammatory biopharmaceuticals is financed through the hospitals budgets. One can assume that transfer of the financing responsibility for these medicines is followed by increased price competition and lower prices. Also as a result of tendering competitions accomplished by Norwegian Drug Procurement Co-operation. The main hypotheses to test were: Due to the financing reform of 2006 and introduction of tendering competition as a result of that, the pharmacy retail prices on TNF-α inhibitors have been decreased over the years. Due to increased number of competitors (therapeutically equal bio- and pharmaceuticals), the pharmacy retail prices have been decreased over the years. The panel data of 637 observations on 15 biopharmaceuticals in the time period of 01. 2003 - 04. 2008 was included to verify the hypotheses. Because of difference in time points of market entrance not all of the biopharmaceuticals are from start to end, which makes the panel data unbalanced. These are data from both primary and secondary sources. The first hypothesis, that pharmacy retail prices on TNF-α inhibitors have been decreased over the years due to the financing reform of 2006 and introduction of tendering competition is confirmed. Analyses of price effects were done in two ways and were similar to the methods mentioned in the temporary report (Bjarkum et al 2008). The first one was to analyse the retail pharmacy prices from the Norwegian Pharmacy Association in comparison to the maximum pharmacy prices from the Norwegian Medicines Agency. The second method was to analyse the prices by using fixed effects linear regression. Analysis of the effects of the financing reform on competition was done by using static OLS linear regression, log-log model and by calculating Herfindahl-Hirschman index. The main results approve the hypotheses. The achieved effects of the reform of 2006 seem to be in the range of approximately 40 60 millions NOK per year (after 01. 2007) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecirculating {{aquaculture}} systems (RAS) {{are increasingly}} being used for Atlantic salmon smolt production. However, knowledge of how the RAS environment affects welfare and performance of Atlantic salmon is limited. For instance, safe limits for chronic exposure to typical compounds in RAS, such as NH 3 -N, NO 2 -N, and CO 2 should be established for Atlantic salmon, {{as well as their}} interactions with nutrition, other RAS water compounds, and the microbiota. These questions can best be answered in a research facility that is providing a RAS environment. In addition, the facility described here was required to produce 480000 smolts annually, to provide sufficient research fish in the institution. Design and dimensioning of such a facility require attention to flexibility for various experimental designs, and the flexibility to vary specific water quality constituents, properties that are not necessary in a standard production plant. A research facility of 1754 m 2 ground floor area (Nofima Centre for Recirculation in Aquaculture, NCRA), was designed and constructed for these purposes at a cost of 45 <b>mill.</b> <b>NOK</b> (2010 value). The facility included six experimental halls, a number of support rooms, and four independent RASs. Water quality requirements at maximum feed loading were in the design phase set to < 10 mg/L CO 2, < 0. 7 – 1 mg/L TAN, and < 0. 1 mg/L NO 2 -N, and the RASs dimensioned with this objective. The facility was designed so that water from different RAS or flow-through water sources could be chosen {{at the level of the}} culture tanks, thus giving flexibility for experimentation. Performance of the facility was tested in two trials, during the first 3 years of operation. In Trial 1, a standard production study showed that Atlantic salmon parr reared in the facility had growth rates comparable to that seen in the Norwegian Atlantic salmon smolt industry. In Trial 2, water quality and removal efficiencies of RAS 1 were evaluated at increasing daily feed loads. Removal efficiencies were comparable, in the case of TAN, and when calculated for the system as a whole also for CO 2, to assumptions made during dimensioning and design of the facility. The RAS maintained water quality within set limits for TAN and CO 2, but not in the case of nitrite (0. 22 mg/L NO 2 -N versus 0. 1 mg/L limit). The water quality limits of TAN and CO 2 were reached, not at full feed capacity, but at 134 % of the theoretical feed capacity calculated prior to construction. This dimensioning was based on an often used methodology. When recalculating the RAS 1 TAN production, but now using published Atlantic salmon parr N-retention data, it was found that the methodology used prior to construction may over-estimate the TAN production by about 34 %. Thus, Trial 2 was useful for recalibrating the feed load capacity of the RASs, and for accurate experimental design in future projects. It is expected that in the long-term NCRA will be useful in determining the environmental and nutritional requirements of fish reared in RAS...|$|R
40|$|Røros Meat {{is a local}} meat {{processing}} company emphasizing local and traditional products. Since 2011 the company has produced organic products to the retail chain Rema 1000. Before and today the main activity is processing non-organic and traditional 3 products for the HoReCa (Hotel, Restaurant and Catering) -market in the region. Røros Meat is located in Os, a neighboring municipality of Røros. Despite {{the fact that the}} two locations belong to different counties; they are located in the same mountain region of the eastern parts of Southern Norway. The reason for using the name Røros in their business name is the already established value of this name/brand due to Røros status as a historical mining town on UNESCO’s World Heritage List, and Røros is a well-known name and travelling spot for both national and international tourism. Beside traditional economic activities such as agriculture and forestry, tourism is a very important activity for the town and the district. Røros Meat, established in 2003, took over another meat processor company, which had a low performance. Regional organic farmers were decisive in establishing the {{meat processing}} company just as they were for Røros Dairy. They wanted a local milk- and meat processing opportunity for their organic productions. The regional organic farmer cooperative, Økomat Røros BA, was a driving force for starting the company. Five private actors, the organic cooperative Økomat Røros, and Røros Dairy came in as shareholders. Røros Abattoir was one of the owners. In 2007 they bought new shares in the company and they now own about 60 % of the shares. The abattoir has two persons in the board of Røros Meat, where one of these are the chair of board. From 2014 the General Manager of Røros Abattoir now also hold this position in Røros Meat. The plan is to merge the two companies. The main reason why we wanted to study the value chain of Røros Meat as part of the Healthy Growth project is their production of organic products for the supermarket chain REMA 1000. REMA 1000 is a typical discount chain in Norway and until recently organic food has not been a focus.

It is therefore desirable to calculate the air clearances on the basis of smaller safety margins than described in the standard, but which is still within acceptable safety limits. In the formulas for minimum distances, the statistical withstand voltage U 50 %, gap-factors and altitude factors are examined for the cases of operating voltage, switching impulse and lightning impulse. Discrepancies between test results from a laboratory work conducted by STRI and calculations based on the EN standard of U 50 %, have been discovered. Tested U 50 for switching impulses are 5 9 % higher than U 50 from the standard. The same applies for lightning impulses where the tested value is 12 % higher than the standard. This gives reason to assume the standard to be somewhat conservative. Further, discrepancies are found between the standard EN 50341 that says that the gap factor when an insulator is present is the same as if no insulator is present, and Cigré report 72, which says that the gap factor should be corrected for the presence of insulators. Correction for insulators will lead to a lower gap factor i. e. lower break down strength along the insulator string than {{in the rest of the}} air gap. It turns out that the combination of rain and insulator string reduce the gap factor and thus, the withstand strength in the cases of switching impulses in the order of 6 - 13 % for V-string insulators and 20 - 34 % for I-string insulators and for continuous power frequency voltage in the order of 25 % for V-string insulators and 33 - 40 % for I-string insulators. Rain has no influence on the withstand strength of I-strings or V-strings exposed to lightning impulses. Several previous researches [1][2] shows the same tendencies of lack of correlation between U 50 and gap factors when air gaps with insulator strings are exposed to lightning impulses. Thus, the gap factor is not sufficient to describe the discharge characteristics of air gaps with insulator strings exposed to lightning impulses. It is found that the air gap between phase and guy wire has approximately 7 % greater withstand strength than over the insulator string in a tower window. This additional safety margin is a desirable property in terms that the guy wires are the weakest point of a tower. This should however be verified by full-scale laboratory tests as this is mainly valid for the case of only the conductor-guy wire gap without the presence of the other air gaps that represent the tower window...|$|R
