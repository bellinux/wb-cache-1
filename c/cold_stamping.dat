40|$|Beside {{a loss in}} texture, {{the main}} quality aspect of filled {{chocolate}} products during storage {{is the development of}} fat bloom. For these products isothermal or cycling temperature storage tests are used for accelerated shelf life prediction. However, the applicability of these tests compared to real storage conditions is complicated and shelf life estimation is vague. Com; 1;paring storage tests of different authors is difficult because products and analysis methods vary. Additionally most of the storage tests are performed to identify the reasons for fat bloom and therefore the storage conditions are not separately investigated. However, all studies agree that temperature has a major impact due to its influence on migration and crystallization. While migration is accelerated at higher temperatures, crystallization shows an optimum at lower temperatures. Therefore, migration and crystal state have to be evaluated during storage, as well as fat bloom formation. In this study, <b>cold</b> <b>stamped</b> dark chocolate shells with nougat filling were chosen to compare isothermal and cycling temperature storage conditions. Cycling temperature storage at adequate levels includes optimum for fat bloom formation, but takes crystallization and migration influence in unequal account.

And on the linen was written in an oval, [...] "Menkau-ra, Royal Son of the Sun." [...] We could in no wise loosen this linen, it held so firm on to the body. Therefore, faint with the great heat, choked with mummy dust and the odour of spices, and trembling with fear of our unholy task, wrought in that most lonesome and holy place, we laid the body down, and ripped away the last covering with the knife. First we cleared Pharaoh's head, and now the face that no man had gazed on for three thousand years was open to our view.

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry has increased significantly {{the use of}} advanced high strength steels (AHSS) in many structural components, with the aim to reduce weight and also to increase safety. The high resistance of these steels {{is accompanied by a}} decrease in formability, which makes simulation a requirement to adequately foresee the formability of a particular stretch formed component. This work shows that Abaqus can be used in the <b>cold</b> <b>stamping</b> calculations, by mainly estimating the occurrence of rupture and necking during forming. Formability studies usually use forming limit diagrams (FLD), based on stains, as a failure criterion, but this approach is not effective when working with AHSS.

A brief explanation of how to obtain these FLSD curves is presented, where ABAQUS also plays an important role.
