The <b>call</b> <b>establishment</b> tests showed that the H. 323 protocols could establish calls successfully under severely impaired conditions. The listening tests showed that uncontrolled jitter was the most destructive parameter to listening quality. Packet loss was also influential, though somewhat less dramatically.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{possibility}} of establishing a secure VoIP telephone call using SIP. Different security services relevant for VoIP are presented and we argue that end-to-end authentication and encryption should be provided by default. For media protection we evaluate {{the possibility of}} using either SRTP or IPSec, and we examine several alternatives of how a secure VoIP call can be established. The solution we suggest is based on SRTP for media protection, S/MIME and MIKEY for end-to-end authentication and keying, and TLS for hop-by-hop protection of SIP messages. We also present measurements of secure <b>call</b> <b>establishment</b> for MIKEY, SRTP and IPSec using our own SIP user agent (minisip). Our conclusion is that the <b>call</b> <b>establishment</b> delay will not be significantly affected by introducing these security protocols. ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} show how an SBC works one can compare a simple <b>call</b> <b>establishment</b> {{sequence}} with a <b>call</b> <b>establishment</b> sequence with an SBC. [...] In the simplest session establishment sequence with only one proxy between the user agents the proxy’s task is to identify the callee’s location and forward the request to it. The proxy also adds a Via header with its own address to indicate the path that the response should traverse. The proxy does not change any dialog identification information present in the message such as the tag in the From header, the Call-Id or the Cseq. Proxies also do not alter any information in the SIP message bodies. Note that during the session initiation phase the user agents exchange SIP messages with the SDP bodies that include addresses at which the agents expect the media traffic. After successfully finishing the session initiation phase the user agents can exchange the media traffic directly between each other without {{the involvement of the}} proxy.|$|R
