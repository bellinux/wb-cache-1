Due to the subjectivity of emotions, the generation of appropriate ground truth data poses challenges for MER. This paper describes obstacles of defining and measuring emotions evoked by music. Two methods, in principle able to overcome problems in measuring affective states induced by music, are outlined and their results are compared. Although the results of both methods are in line with psychological theories of emotions, the question remains how good the perceived emotions are captured by either method and if these methods are sufficient for ground truth generation...|$|R

40|$|The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is {{the most}} widely used {{indirect}} measure of attitudes in social psychology. It has been suggested that artefacts such as salience asymmetries and familiarity can influence performance on the IAT. Chang and Mitchell (2009) proposed that the ease with which IAT stimuli are <b>classified</b> (<b>classification</b> fluency) is the common mechanism underlying both of these factors. In the current study, we investigated the effect of classification fluency on the IAT and trialled a measure-the split IAT-for dissociating between the effects of valence and salience in the IAT. Across six experiments, we examined the relationship between target classification fluency and salience asymmetries in the IAT. In the standard IAT, the more fluently classified target category was, all else being equal, compatible with pleasant attributes over unpleasant attributes. Furthermore, the more fluently classified target category was more easily classified with the more salient attribute category in the split IAT, independent of evaluative associations. This suggests that the more fluently classified category is also the more salient target category. © 2011 The Experimental Psychology Society...|$|R
