5000|$|Cryostat {{are used}} in {{medicine}} to cut histological slides. They are usually used in a process called frozen section histology (see Frozen section procedure). The cryostat is essentially an ultrafine [...] "deli-slicer", called a microtome, placed in a freezer. The cryostat is usually a stationary upright freezer, with an external wheel for rotating the microtome. The temperature can be varied, depending on the tissue being cut - usually from minus 20 to minus 30 degree Celsius. The freezer is either powered by electricity, or by a refrigerant like liquid nitrogen. Small portable cryostats are available and can run off generators or vehicle inverters. To minimize unnecessary warming all necessary mechanical movements of the microtome {{can be achieved by}} hand via a wheel mounted outside the chamber. Newer microtomes have electric push button advancement of the tissue. The precision of the cutting is in micrometres. Tissue are sectioned as thin as 1 micrometre. Usual histology slides are mounted with a thickness of about 7 micrometres. Specimens that are soft at room temperature are mounted on a <b>cutting</b> <b>medium</b> (often made of egg white) on a metal [...] "chuck", and frozen to cutting temperature (for example at -20 degrees C). Once frozen, the specimen on the chuck is mounted on the microtome. The crank is rotated and the specimen advances toward the cutting blade. Once the specimen is cut to a satisfactory quality, it is mounted on a warm (room temperature) clear glass slide, where it will instantaneously melt and adhere. The glass slide and specimen is dried with a dryer or air dried, and stained. The entire process from mounting to reading the slide takes from 10 to 20 minutes, allowing rapid diagnosis in the operating room, for the surgical excision of cancer. The cryostat can be used to cut histology and tissue slide (e.g., for enzyme localization) outside of medicine, but the quality of the section is poor compared to standard fixed section wax mounted histology.|$|E

40|$|Cutting {{processes}} play a centrao role in food industry. Beyond {{the conventional}} processing with mechanic tools {{the use of}} high-pressure jet tools provides process-immanent advantages. Thus, with high-pressure jet the processing of foods {{can be carried out}} highly flexible. In many fields of the food industry compound materials with different properties must be cut (e. g. pizza-paste/filling, biscuit/chocolate, cheese/rind, etc.). The high-pressure jet offers a tool that can operate quite independently of the specific material characteristics. Because of the small mechanical loads of the substance during the cutting, it is possible to cut different materials simultaneously without deforming the substance, destroying the joint of splitting brittle materials. Moreover, the permanently renewing <b>cutting</b> <b>medium</b> avoids contamination by the cutting tool. By integrating an appropriate software support like CAD/CAM systems, different variants of the high-pressure jet can be realised without modify ing the tool. Through the high flexibility lf the jet, the cutting path can be fit to the current demanded geometry. Thus a minimisation of waste as well as an exact portioning by weight and form is possible. After a general introduction, this papaer describes the technique of high-pressure jet facilities and the using potentials of this technique, particularly in the food industry.

40|$|Provedený {{experiment}}ální výzkum byl zaměřen na určení vlivu řezných podmínek a řezného prostředí na velikost teplot a velikost, směr a charakter zbytkového napětí v obrobeném povrchu při frézování těžkoobrobitelné slitiny titanu Ti 6 Al 4 V. Pro experiment byla použita kombinace tří řezných rychlostí vc: 50, 100, 150 m. min- 1, tří posuvů na zub fz: 0, 05, 0, 085, 0, 12 mm a tří řezných prostředí: obrábění za sucha, olejová mlha (aerosol vzduchu a oleje) a povodňové chlazení olejovou emulzí. Znalost teplot při obrábění je v daném případě nezbytná vzhledem ke skutečnosti, že při teplotách větších než 600 °C má Ti a jeho slitiny vysokou afinitu k intersticiálním prvkům obsažených ve vzduchu (a řezném prostředí), které vedou k tvorbě tvrdé vrstvy kysličníků a pod ní ležící zpevněné vrstvy. V kombinaci s nízkou tepelnou vodivostí slitiny Ti 6 Al 4 V dochází k lokalizaci vysokých teplot v těsné blízkosti břitu a tedy i pod obrobeným povrchem. Tato skutečnost posléze výrazně ovlivňuje velikost a charakter zbytkových napětí. This research {{deals with}} a determination of effect of cutting conditions and cutting environment on temperature and behaviour of residual stress in machined surface. The experiment was based on milling of difficult-to-cut titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V. A combination of three cutting speeds: 50; 100; 150 m. min- 1, three feed per tooth: 0, 05; 0, 085; 0, 12 mm and three different cutting media: dry cutting, oil mist and flood cooling, has been applied in the experiment. Understanding to behaviour of cutting temperature is necessary. Titanium alloys have very high affinity to interstitial elements contained in air (and <b>cutting</b> <b>medium).</b> When the cutting temperature is higher then 600 °C, these chemical elements create hard oxidic cover and hardened underlays. The highest temperature is localized very close to cutting edge and also under machined surface. The reason is low thermal conductivity of Ti 6 Al 4 V. Phenomena mentioned above influence magnitude and character of residual stress in machined surface. Measurement of temperatures has been splited on two parts – measurement of cutting temperature and measurement of temperature of machined surface. A natural thermocouple {{has been used for}} measuring of cutting temperature. For surface temperature measurement has been used a semi synthetic thermocouple. The magnitude of residual stress in surface layer was analysed using a destructive method of measurement. The method is based on electrolytic removal of material from inspected surface. Removing of surface layer causes a deformation, which is possible to determine a stress, which is proportional to the deformation. The accuracy of the measurement is dependent on thickness of removed layer, which has to be equal all over the surface. In accordance to the results of this research it is possible to recommend for finish milling of Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy by sintered carbide cutting tool following cutting conditions - cutting speed between 50 m. min- 1 and 100 m. min- 1, feed per tooth fz approximately 0, 05 mm. These cutting conditions have been determined with reference to cutting temperature and residual stress in machined surface. The most suitable type of cutting environment is the flood cooling (5, 5 % Ecocool 2520 + water). Usage of flood cooling lowers surface temperature and cutting temperature. That causes decrease of residual stress in machined surface. A disadvantage of the flood cooling is, that sudden destruction of tool tip can occurs. The titanium alloy has a very low heat conductivity, therefore most of heat goes through the cutting tool. The reason of sudden destruction is a thermal shock, which causes chipping of tool tip...|$|E

40|$|AbstractProteomics {{analysis}} {{is important for}} characterizing tissues to gain biological and pathological insights, {{which could lead to}} the identification of disease-associated proteins for disease diagnostics or targeted therapy. However, tissues are commonly embedded in optimal <b>cutting</b> temperature <b>medium</b> (OCT) or are formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) in order to maintain tissue morphology for histology evaluation. Although several tissue proteomic analyses have been performed on FFPE tissues using advanced mass spectrometry (MS) technologies, high-throughput proteomic analysis of OCT-embedded tissues has been difficult due to the interference of OCT in the MS analysis. In addition, molecules other than proteins present in tissues further complicate tissue proteomic analysis. Here, we report the development of a method using chemical immobilization of proteins for peptide extraction (CIPPE). In this method, proteins are chemically immobilized onto a solid support; interferences from tissues and OCT embedding are removed by extensive washing of proteins conjugated on the solid support. Peptides are then released from the solid phase by proteolysis, enabling MS analysis. This method was first validated by eliminating OCT interference from a standard protein, human serum albumin, where all of the unique peaks contributed by OCT contamination were eradicated. Finally, this method was applied for the proteomic analysis of frozen and OCT-embedded tissues using iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation) labeling and two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.

The research used quantitative research techniques to evaluate data on solid waste generation rates in Jimeta. The findings revealed that the waste generation rate varies according to the constituencies ranging. Between, 0. 42 - 0. 78 /capita/days <b>cutting</b> across low, <b>medium</b> and high density wards. The analysis of waste management profile in the study area shows, there is inadequate management of municipal solid waste in the metropolis. This paper implies evaluation of the generation rates of municipal solid wastes (MSW) as the basic tool in planning for improve management of solid waste in the Metropolis, with balancing the aim of privatizing of solid waste management, sustainability in service coverage and recycling the solid waste into energy generation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to demonstrate surface roughness and chip formation by the machining of Aluminium silicon alloy (AlSic) matrix composite, reinforced with aluminium nitride (AlN), with three types of carbide inserts present. Experiments were conducted at various cutting speeds, feed rates, and depths of cut, according to the Taguchi method, using a standard orthogonal array L 9 (3 4). The effects of cutting speeds, feed rates, depths of cut, and types of tool on surface roughness during the milling operation were evaluated using Taguchi optimization methodology, using the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. The surface finish produced is very important in determining whether the quality of the machined part is within specification and permissible tolerance limits. It is understood that chip formation is a fundamental element that influences tool performance. The analysis of chip formation was done using a Sometech SV- 35 video microscope. The analysis of results, using the S/N ratio, concluded that a combination of low feed rate, low depth of cut, <b>medium</b> <b>cutting</b> speed, and an uncoated tool, gave a remarkable surface finish. The chips formed from the experiment varied from semi–continuous t...|$|R
40|$|Debido a la importancia que ha adquirido el cultivo {{de flores}} para exportación en la Sabana de Bogotá, se realizó el presente trabajo con el fin de establecer el efecto que tiene la localización de los esquejes en la planta madre sobre los procesos de enraizamiento en Gypsophila paniculata L. Se tomaron como tratamientos: esquejes del tercio superior, del tercio medio y del tercio {{inferior}} de la planta y se evaluó bajo un diseño completamente al azar el enraizamiento a los 21, 29, 37 y 45 días a partir de la siembra, registrando la capacidad de acumulación de materia seca en la raíz y evaluando por el método de Dunhan modificando la cantidad de raíces que presentaban actividad metabólica. A {{lo largo de}} los cuatro muestreos se observó mayor formación de raíces en los esquejes provenientes del tercio inferior, seguidos por los esquejes del tercio medio de la planta que presentaron buena respuesta; los esquejes del tercio superior enraizaron más lentamente. Los datos obtenidos por los dossistemas de medición se correlacionaron estadísticamente. Se observó que utilizando esquejes de los estratos medio e inferior es posible disminuir en ocho días el tiempo de enraizamiento que se emplea comercialmente para esquejes de G. paniculata y se señala que una posible causa de asincronia en los procesos de crecimiento y desarrollo en el cultivo puede ser consecuencia de los procesos de selección de esquejes para propagar. In order to the importance that the flower cultivation has adquired to the exportation from the Sabana of Bogotá, this investigation was done to establish {{the effect that the}} cutting localization in the mother plant has on the rooting process in the Gypsophila paniculata L. As treatments were used: Cuttings from the upper third, from the medium third and from the lower third and the rooting was evaluated usinga completely random design at 21, 29, 37, and 45 days beginning from the sowing day, recording dry material accurnulation capacity and evaluating using the modified Dunhan method the amount of roots having metabolic activity. The most root formation was seen in the cutting obtained from the lower third, followed by the <b>cuttings</b> from the <b>medium</b> third that showed good response; the cuttings from the upper third took root more slowly. The datas obtained from both methods were correlated statistically. It was observed that using <b>cuttings</b> from the <b>medium</b> and low third it was possible to make eigth days smaller the rooting time than the commercially used for G. paniculata cuttings and it was seen that the processes of selecting cuttings may be a cause of the asynchronous growing and developing process in the cultivation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the influence of}} cutting parameters (Depth of cut, feed rate, spindle speed and cutting fluid flow rate) on the surface roughness and flank wear of physical vapor deposition (PVD) Cathodic arc evaporation coated TiAlN tungsten carbide cutting tool insert during CNC turning of AISI 1015 mild steel. Analysis of Variance {{has been applied to}} determine the critical influence of cutting parameters. Taguchi orthogonal test design has been employed to optimize the process parameters affecting surface roughness and tool wear. Depth of cut was found to be the most dominant factor contributing to high surface roughness (67. 5 %) of the inserts. However, cutting speed, feed rate and flow rate of cutting fluid showed minimal contribution to surface roughness. On the other hand, cutting speed (45. 6 %) and flow rate of cutting fluid (23 %) were the dominant factors influencing tool wear. The optimum cutting conditions for desired surface roughness constitutes the following parameters such as <b>medium</b> <b>cutting</b> speed, low feed rate, low depth of cut and high cutting fluid flow rate. Minimal tool wear was achieved for the following process parameters such as low cutting speed, low feed rate, medium depth of cut and high cutting fluid flow rate...|$|R
