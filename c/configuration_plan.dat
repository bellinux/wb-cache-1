Now we overcome these drawbacks through intelligent wireless mesh network by using ARS (autonomous reconfiguration system). In this system we are using mobile terminals, two gateways, mobile server and four foreign agents. In this system we send the data from one foreign agents to another though the gateways. Our system is totally based on ARS algorithms. ARS generates the reconfiguration plan and does the localize changes to Network.

To maintain these ARS include rerouting for reconfiguration plan and also the connectivity with help of the routing protocol during recovery period. Autonomous Reconfiguration System (ARS) is the solution to the above mention limitation. ARS performs the real time recovery of the failure link of the network.

The specific nature and goals of AmI applications, however, requires minimizing the invasiveness of data collection methods, often resulting in a drastic reduction of data quality and a plague of unforeseen effects which can put standard face recognition systems out of action. In order to deal with this, a face recognition system for AmI applications must not only be carefully designed but also subject to an exhaustive <b>configuration</b> <b>plan</b> to ensure it offers the required accuracy, robustness and real-time performance. This document covers the design and tuning of a holistic face recognition system targeting an Ambient Intelligence scenario.

40|$|The System-Oriented Runway Management (SORM) {{concept was}} {{developed}} {{as part of}} the Airspace Systems Program (ASP) Concepts and Technology Development (CTD) Project, and is composed of two basic capabilities: Runway Configuration Management (RCM), and Combined Arrival/Departure Runway Scheduling (CADRS). RCM is the process of designating active runways, monitoring the active runway configuration for suitability given existing factors, and predicting future configuration changes; CADRS is the process of distributing arrivals and departures across active runways based on local airport and National Airspace System (NAS) goals. The central component in the SORM concept is a tool for taking into account all the various factors and producing a recommendation for what would be the optimal runway configuration, runway use strategy, and aircraft sequence, considering as many of the relevant factors required in making this type of decision, and user preferences, if feasible. Three separate tools were initially envisioned for this research area, corresponding to the time scale in which they would operate: Strategic RCM (SRCM), with a planning horizon on the order of several hours, Tactical RCM (TRCM), with a planning horizon on the order of 90 minutes, and CADRS, with a planning horizon on the order of 15 - 30 minutes[1]. Algorithm development was initiated in all three of these areas, but the most fully developed to date is the TRCM algorithm. Earlier studies took a high-level approach to benefits, estimating aggregate benefits across most of the major airports in the National Airspace Systems (NAS), for both RCM and CADRS [2]. Other studies estimated the benefit of RCM and CADRS using various methods of re-sequencing arrivals to reduce delays 3, 4, or better balancing of arrival fixes 5, 6. Additional studies looked at different methods for performing the optimization involved in selecting the best Runway <b>Configuration</b> <b>Plan</b> (RCP) to use 7 - 10. Most of these previous studies were high-level or generic in nature (not focusing on specific airports), and benefits were aggregated for the entire NAS, with relatively low fidelity simulation of SORM functions and aircraft trajectories.

In this approach, the system is capable of performing a reconfiguration action in order to recover from a permanent fault. Moreover, self- healing system should have the ability to modify its own behavior in response to changes within the environment.
