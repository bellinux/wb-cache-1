50|$|<b>Cornerpost</b> Peak is a peak, 2,160 m high, at the {{southeast}} end of Leitch Massif in the Concord Mountains, Victoria Land, Antarctica. The topographical feature was so {{named by the}} northern party of the New Zealand Federated Mountain Clubs Antarctic Expedition (NZFMCAE), 1962-63, because they established their most northerly survey station here on the turning point of their traverse. The peak lies situated on the Pennell Coast, a portion of Antarctica lying between Cape Williams and Cape Adare.|$|E
50|$|On 5 March 2013, Fox Sports {{unveiled}} its new {{headquarters at}} Artarmon, New South Wales, {{where it was}} announced the main studio would be named the Clive Churchill Studio in name of the NRL immortal Clive Churchill as the studio will house NRL coverage. Technical innovations were the main highlight, with CEO Patrick Delany unveiling the FoxKopter, the FoxMobile Segway, Ref Cam and <b>Cornerpost</b> Cam. Fox Sports also launched a new corporate logo in line with its global affiliate broadcasters.|$|E
50|$|Without a doubt, the municipality’s centrepiece is the Town Hall, {{which the}} knightly monastery had built in 1608 {{as a new}} {{courthouse}} (for the higher and village court). The two-floor building with a gabled roof and lovely indoor stucco work is typical of Franconian-Hessian timber-frame construction of the Renaissance after 1555. The massively built ground floor was originally an open hall with a round-arch opening (remnants were brought to light in 1968). The in parts “disordered” timber-frame structure over the entrance suggests that there was once an outdoor stairway {{up to the first}} floor. All <b>cornerposts,</b> the odd slanted beam, various crossbeams and the whole oriel are covered in vine and grape carvings, mouldings and grotesque faces. On a windowpost facing the Rhine, the names of the Schultheiß (roughly “sheriff”) and the Schöffen (roughly “lay jurists”) in the year when the Town Hall was built can still be made out.|$|R
