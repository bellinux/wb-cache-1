40|$|The {{functions}} of the αC domains of fibrinogen in <b>clotting</b> and fibrinolysis, which have long been enigmatic, were determined using recombinant fibrinogen truncated at Aα chain residue 251. Scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy revealed that the fibers of α 251 <b>clots</b> were thinner and denser, with more branch points than fibers of control <b>clots.</b> Consistent with these results, the permeability of α 251 <b>clots</b> was nearly half that of control <b>clots.</b> Together, {{these results suggest that}} in normal <b>clot</b> formation, the αC domains enhance lateral aggregation to produce thicker fibers. The viscoelastic properties of α 251 fibrin <b>clots</b> differed markedly from control clots; α 251 <b>clots</b> were much less stiff and showed more plastic deformation, indicating that interactions between the αC domains in normal <b>clots</b> {{play a major role in}} determining the <b>clot's</b> mechanical properties. Comparing factor XIIIa cross-linked α 251 and control <b>clots</b> showed that γ chain cross-linking had a significant effect on <b>clot</b> stiffness. Plasmin-catalyzed lysis of α 251 <b>clots,</b> monitored with both macroscopic and microscopic methods, was faster than lysis of control <b>clots.</b> In conclusion, these studies provide the first definitive evidence that the αC domains play an important role in determining the structure and biophysical properties of <b>clots</b> and their susceptibility to fibrinolysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{adhesion}} {{and migration}} of human diploid fibroblasts on plasma <b>clots</b> were measured. The role of plasma fibronectin was examined by depleting plasma of fibronectin before <b>clotting.</b> Fibronectin was not essential for cell adhesion and spreading, although rates were slightly slower on depleted <b>clots.</b> Rates of migration {{on the surface}} of <b>clots</b> were unaffected by fibronectin depletion. In contrast, fibronectin was an absolute requirement for migration of cells into plasma <b>clots.</b> Cells migrated rapidly into control <b>clots</b> but completely failed to penetrate the surface of fibronectin-depleted <b>clots.</b> The effect of depletion could only be reversed by adding fibronectin to depleted plasma before <b>clotting.</b> Adsorption of fibronectin after <b>clotting</b> failed to reverse the effect of depletion, suggesting that fibronectin had to be cross- linked by transglutaminase during the <b>clotting</b> process...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{cirrhosis}} have hemostatic changes, {{which may}} contribute to a risk of thrombosis. This in vitro study compares <b>clot</b> formation and structure between patients and healthy subjects. <b>Clot</b> formation is delayed in patients; ultimately, however, <b>clot</b> permeability is decreased. The thrombogenic structure of fibrin <b>clots</b> {{may contribute to}} the thrombotic risk in cirrhosis. Background and Objectives: Patients with cirrhosis can be at risk of thrombotic complications due to an imbalance between hemostatic components. However, little is known on how the disease affects <b>clot</b> generation or how alterations in the structure of fibrin <b>clots</b> may affect the hemostatic function of these patients. Methods: We investigated the formation and structure of <b>clots</b> generated with plasma and purified fibrinogen of 42 patients with cirrhosis. <b>Clots</b> generated with plasma and fibrinogen of 29 healthy volunteers were studied for comparison. <b>Clot</b> formation and structure were assessed by turbidity, permeation studies, confocal laser and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The extent of fibrinogen oxidation was assessed by measuring the carbonyl content of purified fibrinogen samples. Results: Tissue factor and thrombin-induced <b>clotting</b> of plasma was delayed in patients. The <b>clotting</b> rate was also decreased, but change in turbidity, fibrin density and fiber thickness were largely comparable to healthy volunteers. Conversely, <b>clot</b> permeability was significantly decreased in patients. When <b>clots</b> were generated with purified fibrinogen, differences in <b>clot</b> formation and structure similar to those in plasma were found. The carbonyl content was increased in patient fibrinogen and correlated with disease severity and <b>clot</b> permeability. Conclusions: Delayed <b>clot</b> formation in cirrhosis ultimately results in decreased <b>clot</b> permeability. Similar alterations in <b>clots</b> generated with purified fibrinogen suggest that modifications of the molecule are (partly) responsible.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 A {{primary cause}} of {{bleeding}} and mortality after traumatic injury is failure of hemostatic <b>clot</b> formation at wound sites. After trauma, approximately 25 - 30 % of severe injured patients display trauma induced coagulopathy (TIC) which is a multifactorial condition that causes poor <b>clot</b> formation and performance. A decreased level of viscoelastic <b>clot</b> stiffness or strength and rapid <b>clot</b> breakdown by enzymatic degradation are hallmarks of this condition. <b>Clots</b> formed under these conditions are unable to withstand hemodynamic forces of flowing blood, and therefore are likely to repeatedly rupture, leading to progressive bleeding and worsening coagulopathy. Current research examines <b>clot</b> formation to understand TIC and to guide treatment. However, the most useful and clinically-relevant aspect of <b>clot</b> formation, for TIC, is <b>clot</b> durability (i. e. its resistance to breakdown) instead of the initiating events related to <b>clot</b> formation. Decreased <b>clot</b> viscoelastic firmness is among the first changes taking place during TIC, which can be detected using current viscoelastic monitors including thrombelastograpy (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). However, these devices (TEG/ROTEM) are not ideal modalities for assessing <b>clot</b> mechanical properties in trauma conditions due {{to the amount of}} time taken to obtain results, poor sensitivity, repeatability, and lack of standardization. Therefore, in this thesis, I examine <b>clot</b> durability and failure characteristics using a novel method to better understand TIC and develop new clinically-relevant point-of-care diagnostic. I developed a system that forms a <b>clot</b> in a small tube and then applies increasing pressure until the <b>clot</b> fails. I show that that <b>clot</b> failure is strongly associated with intrinsic mechanical properties of the <b>clot.</b> I show the effect of fibrinogen, factor XIIIa, platelet count on the in-vitro failure pressure of the <b>clot.</b> The <b>clot</b> failure system shows strong correlation with the maximum <b>clot</b> firmness obtained from ROTEM, suggesting that it could be used to diagnose TIC and inform the clinicians on the pressure at which <b>clots</b> will fail in patients, thus guiding patient care in trauma situations...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} progressive haemodilution on the dynamics of fibrin <b>clot</b> formation and <b>clot</b> microstructure using a novel rheological method. The technique measures <b>clotting</b> time (T_GP), <b>clot</b> strength (G'_GP), and quantifies <b>clot</b> microstructure (d_f) at the incipient stages of fibrin formation. We use computational modelling {{to examine the relationship}} between structure and mass, as well as helium ion microscopy (HIM) to compare morphological changes in the fully formed <b>clot</b> to that of the incipient <b>clot.</b> Methods: This is an in vitro study; 90 healthy volunteers were recruited with informed consent and a 20 ml sample of whole blood obtained from each volunteer. Five clinically relevant dilutions were investigated using 0. 9 w. v isotonic saline (0, 10, 20, 40 and 60 %, n = 18 for each dilution). The rheological method of assessing structural <b>clot</b> changes was compared against conventional coagulation screen and fibrinogen estimation. Results: Fractal dimension (df) and final <b>clot</b> microstructure both decreased with progressive dilution (significant at a dilution of 20 %) with similar relationships observed for final <b>clot</b> characteristics in HIM images. Significant correlations were observed between d_f and G'_GP (<b>clot</b> strength) (0. 345, p = 0. 02), as well as <b>clotting</b> time (PT: - 0. 690, p > 0. 001; APTT: - 0. 672, p > 0. 001; T_GP: - 0. 385, p = 0. 006). Conclusions: This study provides new insight into the effects of haemodilution by isotonic saline on <b>clotting</b> time (T_GP), <b>clot</b> strength (G'_GP) and <b>clot</b> microstructure (d_f). Previous studies have attempted to link <b>clot</b> microstructure to <b>clot</b> quality/strength, however this study provides a significant step in quantifying these relationships...|$|R

40|$|Platelets in a dilute {{platelet-rich plasma}} <b>clot</b> {{formed by the}} {{addition}} of thrombin at 4 C do not lose their alpha-granules or develop platelet-fibrin interconnections.

If after <b>clot</b> formation for 30 minutes the <b>clots</b> are transferred to 37 C, the alpha-granules then disappear from the platelet, extensive platelet-fibrin interconnections develop, and the <b>clots</b> retract and lyse. When the dilute plasma <b>clots,</b> however, are formed at 37 C, alpha-granules are quickly lost, few platelet-fibrin interconnections develop, and the <b>clots</b> do not retract or lyse.

These inhibited platelets did not retract or lyse. From the results reported here we conclude that the development of platelet-fibrin interconnections as well as the retraction and lysis of the <b>clot</b> occur in conjunction with the release of alpha-granules from the platelet.
