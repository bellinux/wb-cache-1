Permethrin, deltamethrin, lambdacyhalothrin and pyrethrum were used for impregnation of damaged or undamaged bednets, sisal eaves <b>curtains</b> <b>or</b> <b>bed</b> <b>curtains</b> made of polypropylene fibre. The performance of the synthetic pyrethroids did not differ statistically significantly, except that on a damage net permethrin was better at preventing feeding. sisal eaves curtains deterred mosquitoes from hut entry but did not kill those that had entered. In assessing damaged nets and curtains it must be recognised that anything less than the best vector control may have no appreciable impact on holoendemic malaria...|$|R

40|$|We {{determined}} {{the efficacy of}} the use of permethrin-impregnated uniforms for prevention of malaria and leishmaniasis in a double-blind, randomized study of Colombian soldiers on patrol. In the study of malaria, soldiers were issued impregnated uniforms (i. e., a shirt, an undershirt, pants, socks, and a hat) or uniforms washed in water; the soldiers wore the uniforms day and night for a mean of 4. 2 weeks and were observed for an additional 4 weeks. Three (3 %) of 86 soldiers wearing impregnated uniforms contracted malaria, whereas 12 (14 %) of 86 soldiers wearing control uniforms contracted malaria (P =. 015). In the study of leishmaniasis (soldiers were in the area of endemicity for 6. 6 weeks and were observed for 12 weeks thereafter), 4 (3 %) of 143 soldiers wearing impregnated uniforms and 18 (12 %) of 143 soldiers wearing control uniforms acquired disease (P =. 002). In the leishmaniasis study, and presumably in the malaria study, breakthrough infections in the treated group were primarily due to bites in unclothed regions of the body (face and hands). Permethrin-treated uniforms were virtually nontoxic (there were only two cases of mild skin irritation among 229 subjects), and impregnation is quick and inexpensive. Impregnation of clothing with permethrin is suggested for nonimmune populations who are likely to be exposed to malaria or leishmaniasis over a period of 1 - 2 months. Protection against arthropod-borne diseases such as malaria and leishmaniasis theoretically could be accomplished by elim-ination ofthe arthropod vector or by administering immunopro-phylaxis or chemoprophylaxis to the host, but these fundamen-tal approaches presently lack efficacy and are associated with side effects and high cost. An alternative approach is creation of a barrier between the insect vector and the host. For sedentary populations, treatment of house <b>curtains</b> <b>or</b> <b>bed</b> nets with the insecticide permethrin has been effective against malaria i...|$|R
40|$|At {{night on}} back-alley streets, big-flowered fabrics {{glow in the}} windows of {{thousands}} of homes across the United States. The fabrics are not <b>curtains</b> <b>or</b> <b>bed</b> sheets that have been tacked over windows for privacy. They’re wall drapes, wide swaths of fabric that wrap around the entire homes of Somali Bantu immigrants, the largest group of African refugees that’s ever resettled in the United States. Their former homes in Somalia were generally unseen by society, but their American windows are illuminated by brilliant reds and purples and oranges, colors that pop and wow and trumpet. The colorful beacons can be seen in Brooklyn, or Portland, Maine, or Atlanta—in any of the 50 cities where the Somali Bantus have settled since 2003. One row house in Pittsburgh, Pa., has pink drapes imprinted with red flowers the size of mangoes and plant fronds that curl in myriad directions. Every night, when the lights are turned on inside, the fabric animates two second-story windows in an otherwise muted block of row homes. Inside, the pink drapes cloak the entire living room, covering the walls and windows from floor to ceiling, giving the chamber a tent-like feel. A teenage girl named Asha lives there with her family. The Tent Room is where she serves bowls of rice or noodles to her father, hunches over a coffee table to scratch guesses on her homework, gives her mother insulin shots, breaks up arguments between her five younger siblings, and flirts with boys on MySpace while hoping that her father doesn’t arrange a marriage too soon. Amidst the pink fabrics she imagines her American life—she is rich and beautiful and smart. She has a car to drive and a college degree. She’s a nurse or a banker or an art teacher. She has processed, straight hair and she has a pierced nose. Yet her fantasies often get interrupted as she tries {{to make sense of the}} realities of living in the United States as a Black Muslim daughter. The Tent Room is both a haven and a confine...|$|R

An electrodynamic levitator used to "electrically suspend" single charged particles in order to measure light scattering is presented. This technique allows the determination of optical constants from a spherical, chemically inert particle of unknown chemical composition...|$|R
2500|$|During {{the initial}} 747-8 {{marketing}} phase, Boeing also proposed creating a revenue-generating [...] "SkyLoft" [...] passenger {{facility in the}} crown space above the cabin. This facility would include [...] "SkySuites", small individual compartments with sliding doors <b>or</b> <b>curtains,</b> featuring <b>beds,</b> seating, and entertainment or business equipment. A common [...] area could also be provided. Boeing also proposed smaller, more modest [...] "SkyBunks". Access to the crown area would be via a separate stairway {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. Passengers using the SkySuites, sold at a premium price, would sit in regular economy class seats for take-off and landing, and move to the crown area during flight. However, pricing feasibility studies found the SkyLoft concept difficult to justify. In 2007, Boeing dropped the SkyLoft concept in favor of upper-deck galley storage options, which were favored by the airlines. Outfitting the crown space for sleeping remains an option on VIP aircraft, and the first 747-8 BBJ with AeroLoft was produced in 2012.|$|R
500|$|Although the {{majority}} of surviving English embroidery from the medieval period was intended for church use, this demand decreased radically with the Protestant Reformation. [...] In contrast, {{the bulk of the}} surviving embroidery of the Tudor, Elizabethan, and Jacobean eras is for domestic use, whether for clothing or household decoration. The stable society that existed between the accession of Elizabeth in 1558 and the English Civil War encouraged the building and furnishing of new houses, in which rich textiles played a part. Some embroidery was imported in this period, including the canvas work <b>bed</b> <b>valances</b> once thought to be English but now attributed to France, but {{the majority}} of work was made in England—and increasingly, by skilled amateurs, mostly women, working domestically, to designs by professional men and women, and later to published pattern books.|$|R

500|$|Records also {{indicate}} that Scottish palaces were adorned by rich tapestries, like those that depicted scenes from the Iliad and Odyssey set up for James IV at Holyrood. Some of this was undertaken by exclusive professional embroiders, but needlework was part of female education {{at all levels of}} society. Some of these tapestries were produced by noble ladies, such as [...] the <b>bed</b> <b>valances</b> made by Katherine Ruthven for her marriage in 1551 to Campbell of Glenorchy. These are the oldest surviving examples of Scottish produced embroidery. They display the couple's initials, arms and the story of Adam and Eve. A carpet designed to cover a table may be connected to the marriage of Katherine Oliphant, which has her initials, arms, biblical verses and (perhaps as a pun on her name) an elephant. Much of the needle work of the sixteenth century has been attributed, probably erroneously, to Mary, Queen of Scots. It is thought that she did contribute to the Oxburgh Hangings while imprisoned in England.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{validate}} {{the conclusion of}} our previous prospective study of 250 patients with isolated posterior vitreous detachment: follow-up visits are only necessary if patients mention symptoms of flashes in combination with multiple floaters <b>or</b> a <b>curtain</b> <b>or</b> cloud at the initial examination, or an increase in number of floaters after the initial examination. Methods: Prospective study of 270 consecutive patients with symptomatic isolated posterior vitreous detachment. All patients completed a questionnaire detailing their symptoms and had a full eye examination at the initial examination and at follow-up visits. Logistic regression with backward elimination was used for statistical analysis. We also performed pooled analysis of our previous and present study data. Results: New retinal breaks developed in 10 patients (3. 7 %). Multiple floaters, a <b>curtain</b> <b>or</b> cloud, hemorrhages (retinal or vitreous) at the initial examination, {{and an increase in}} the number of floaters after the initial examination were found to be predictive factors for the development of new retinal breaks. These factors were also the only significant predictors after pooled analysis of both studies (520 patients, 23 breaks). Conclusions: We assume we can formulate a safe policy for scheduling patients with isolated posterior vitreous detachment: only patients with multiple floaters, a <b>curtain</b> <b>or</b> cloud, or hemorrhages (retinal or vitreous) at the initial examination should be scheduled for reexamination. All other patients should return only if the number of floaters increases...|$|R
