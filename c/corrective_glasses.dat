25|$|Yellow tinted {{glasses are}} {{a type of}} glasses with a minor yellow tint. They perform minor color correction, on top of {{reducing}} headaches {{due to lack of}} blinking. They may also be considered minor <b>corrective</b> unprescribed <b>glasses.</b> Depending on the company, these computer or gaming glasses can also filter out high energy blue and ultra-violet light from LCD screens, fluorescent lighting, and other sources of light. This allows for reduced eye-strain. These glasses can be ordered as standard or prescription lenses that fit into standard optical frames. Due to the ultra-violet light blocking nature of these lenses, they also help users sleep at night along with reducing age-related macular degeneration.|$|R
50|$|Contact lenses usually {{serve the}} same <b>corrective</b> purpose as <b>glasses,</b> but are {{lightweight}} and virtually invisible - many commercial lenses are tinted a faint blue {{to make them}} more visible when immersed in cleaning and storage solutions.

Zamućenje sočiva je usledilo posle šest meseci i to intenzivnije na strani tela, koja je bila dalje od izvora struje. Bolesnik je operisan i vid je integralne povraćen. Preporučene su neke profilaktične mere za zaštitu ovih radnika.

After a short {{introduction}} {{into the}} main characteristics of electric cataract, the authors present a case of electric cataract in a worker injured by the high voltage current (35. 000 V). After a »Iatent period« lasting 6 months, the disease appeared in both lenses, but more intensely on the lense of the left eye which was further away from {{the passage of the}} electric current. In their case the electric arc did not pass through the head as was usual in all the cases described so far, but through the raised hand and the chest. What the authors particularly point out are the changes at the base of both eyes, in the region of macula, which in their clinical picture resemble the changes observed in those who happen to look at the sun in eclipse with unprotected eyes. On the basis of this finding the authors are inclined to think that these changes {{are more likely to be}} caused by the intense light in the moment of short circuit than by electric energy. After the operation of the left eye and with a <b>corrective</b> <b>glass,</b> the normal visual acuity has returned to the patient. The changes on the right eye have remained stationary. The authors briefly discuss certain prophilactic measures to be introduced in electric industry, as well as the rehabilitation of workers suffering from electric cataract.

50|$|Early {{treatment}} of strabismus {{when the person}} is a baby may reduce the chance of developing amblyopia and depth perception problems.

Most children eventually recover from amblyopia if they have had the benefit of patches and <b>corrective</b> <b>glasses.</b> Amblyopia has long been considered to remain permanent if not treated within a critical period, namely before the age of about seven years; however, recent discoveries give reason to challenge this view and to adapt the earlier notion of a critical period to account for stereopsis recovery in adults.|$|E
50|$|Like <b>corrective</b> <b>glasses,</b> {{sunglasses}} {{have to meet}} {{special requirements}} when worn for sports.

25|$|Despite the {{increasing}} popularity of contact lenses and laser <b>corrective</b> eye surgery, <b>glasses</b> remain very common, as their technology has improved. For instance, {{it is now}} possible to purchase frames made of special memory metal alloys that return to their correct shape after being bent. Other frames have spring-loaded hinges. Either of these designs offers dramatically better ability to withstand the stresses of daily wear and the occasional accident. Modern frames are also often made from strong, light-weight materials such as titanium alloys, which were not available in earlier times.|$|R
2500|$|Corrective lenses {{are used}} to correct {{refractive}} errors by bending the light entering the eye in order to alleviate the effects of conditions such as nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (Hypermetropia) or astigmatism. The ability of one's eyes to accommodate their focus to near and distant focus alters over time. Also, few people have eyes that show exactly equal refractive characteristics; one may need a [...] "stronger", (i.e. more [...] refracting), lens than the other. A common condition in people over forty years old is presbyopia, which {{is caused by the}} eye's crystalline lens losing elasticity, progressively reducing the ability of the lens to accommodate (i.e. to focus on objects close to the eye). Corrective lenses, to bring the image back into focus on the retina, are made to conform to the prescription of an ophthalmologist or optometrist. [...] A lensmeter can be used to verify the specifications of an existing pair of <b>glasses.</b> <b>Corrective</b> eyeglasses can significantly improve the life quality of the wearer. [...] Not only do they enhance the wearer's visual experience, but can also reduce problems that result from eye strain, such as headaches or squinting.|$|R
5000|$|Special {{protection}} {{is required for}} space travel because the sunlight is far more intense and harmful than on Earth, where it is always filtered through the atmosphere. Sun {{protection is}} needed against much higher UV radiation and even against harmful infrared radiation, {{both within and outside}} the spacecraft. Within the spacecraft, astronauts wear sunglasses with darker lenses and a thin protective gold coating. During space walks, the visor of the astronauts' helmets, which also has a thin gold coating for extra protection, functions as strong sunglasses. The frames of sunglasses and <b>corrective</b> <b>glasses</b> used in space must meet special requirements. They must be flexible and durable, and must fit firmly in zero-gravity. Reliable fit is particularly important when wearing <b>corrective</b> <b>glasses</b> underneath tight helmets and in space suits: once inside the spacesuit, slipped glasses cannot be touched to push them back into place, sometimes for up to ten hours. Frames and glasses must be designed so that small pieces of the glasses such as screws and glass particles cannot become dislodged, then float and be inhaled. 90% of astronauts wear glasses in space, even if they do not require <b>corrective</b> <b>glasses</b> on Earth, because zero-gravity and pressure changes temporarily affect their vision.|$|E

Today, the injection of botulinum toxin into the muscles that surround the eyes is one of the available options in the management of strabismus.

5000|$|The {{correction}} is {{only about}} 1/2 + diopter on the red lens. However, some people with <b>corrective</b> <b>glasses</b> are bothered by difference in lens diopters, as one image is a slightly larger magnification than the other.

There is about a 400% improvement in acuity with a molded diopter filter, and a noticeable improvement of contrast and blackness. The American Amblyopia Foundation uses this feature in their plastic glasses for school screening of children's vision, judging the greater clarity as a significant plus factor.|$|E

40|$|The {{refractive}} {{treatment methods}} of aphakia include <b>corrective</b> <b>glasses,</b> contact lens correction and intraocular lens(IOL) implantation. It magnifies images highly and limits vision field with <b>corrective</b> <b>glasses.</b> For infant aphakia <b>corrective</b> <b>glasses</b> {{are more likely}} to be chosen because their eyes are still unable to tolerate IOL implantation in the developmental stage. With low magnification of images, contact lens includes soft contact lens and rigid contact lens. The former is rarely used because it is prone to ocular lesions due to its poor oxygen permeability. The latter is widely used due to its good oxygen permeability especially suitable for the eyes of irregular astigmatism or iris missing due to trauma. At present, the most commonly used in clinical work is IOL implantation. The eye of IOL may avoid anisometropia, aberrations and so on because of more physiological anatomy. According to the IOL implantation site, it is divided into the anterior chamber IOL implantation and the posterior chamber IOL implantation. The anterior chamber IOL implantation is divided into angle fixed IOL implantation and iris fixed IOL implantation. The posterior chamber IOL implantation is divided into secondary in-the-bag IOL implantation, the ciliary sulcus IOL implantation and transscleral suture fixed IOL implantation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Negative lenses, {{either in}} the form of glasses or contact lenses, can correct nearsightedness. Unlike contact lenses, glasses do not only correct, but also induce optic distortions. In the {{scientific}} literature, it has often been assumed that people who wear <b>corrective</b> <b>glasses</b> instantaneously account for these distortions when they put their glasses on. We tested this assumption and found that, when people switched between their contact lenses and their glasses, they made the errors that one would predict based on the optics. This shows that people are not immediately adapted to their own glasses when they put them on...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} a comprehensive treatment for accommodative esotropia. METHODS: Eighty patients with accommodative esotropia were analyzed. All cases wore <b>corrective</b> <b>glasses</b> 7 d after mydriasis by 10 g/L atropine. The pupils were all comprehensively trained. If {{the position of}} the esotropic eyes could not be corrected by spectacles and both eyes had similar visual acuity in one year, surgical intervention was taken to correct the position. Refraction, visual acuity, visual function and strabismus degree change before and after treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: One year after wearing glasses, 50 cases had corrected eye position through correction and 30 cases were partially accommodative esotropia. Ten cases of esotropia degree >+ 15 △ which could not be complete corrected by cure correction got surgical intervention. Seven cases of them got normal eye positions and 3 cases were over corrected 10 △ - 20 △. After comprehensive treatment of 3 years, the cure rate of amblyopia was 88. 7 %. CONCLUSION: The treatment for accommodative esotropia is a comprehensive course. It is necessary to pay attention to eye position correction, but also for the treatment of amblyopia, while paying attention to establish binocular vision...|$|E
30|$|Orthokeratology is a {{controversial}} technique for correcting myopia. It {{has been in}} use since the 1960 s. It uses contact lenses which are worn to flatten the cornea, reducing its refractive power. These lenses were originally made from polymethyl methacrylate, but are now made of rigid gas-permeable materials. Once the cornea reaches the desired shape, maintenance lenses are used overnight. The user can then see during the day {{without the need for}} <b>corrective</b> <b>glasses</b> or contact lenses. There are significant complications associated with orthokeratology, including corneal abscess, corneal epithelial oedema, corneal abrasions or staining, keratoconus, corneal thinning, corneal scarring, corneal warpage and induced astigmatism [2]. Damage to the corneal epithelium increases the risk of corneal infection. This damage is likely to be greatest at the central cornea, due to the relative curvature of the cornea and the lenses. Therefore, infections often occur centrally and have a severe effect on the patient's vision. The use of overnight lenses is also a risk factor for corneal infection [3]. This may be because of the higher temperature under the closed lid and the absence of blinking and tearing at night [4]. Due to the high risk of severe complications, the use of these lenses is very controversial.|$|E
40|$|Objective : To {{determine}} the effects of the visual functions on the occurrence of road traffic accidents (RTA) amongst commercial drivers in Ife central local government area (LGA) of Osun state of Nigeria. Design : A cross-sectional study. Settings : Four major motor parks located at Ife Central LGA. Materials and Methods : Of the estimated 270 commercial drivers in the four major parks of the LGA, 215 consecutive drivers were interviewed and had their eyes examined. Structured questionnaires were administered by an ophthalmologist. Results: The prevalence of visual impairment (visual acuity < 6 / 18) in the better eye without correction was 3. 3 &#x 0025; &#x 00 B 1; 2. 4 and there was a significant association between uncorrected visual acuity impairment in the better eye and RTA (P = 0. 0152). Refractive error was seen in 8. 4 &#x 0025; of the drivers, but none of these wear <b>corrective</b> <b>glasses.</b> Visual field defect, abnormal stereopsis and color vision impairment did not have any significant association with RTA. Conclusion : Poor visual acuity is strongly associated with RTA amongst Nigerian commercial drivers as opposed to visual field defect, abnormal color vision and stereopsis.

40|$|Background: Human eye captures {{light rays}} {{as they come}} and fall on the retina and convert them into an image. However, in myopia, light rays fall in front of retina, causing {{blurring}} of image. Correction of this is generally done using correcting devices such as <b>corrective</b> <b>glasses</b> and contact lenses. Existence of some alternative therapies is also noticed in literature. Aim: To compare the effects of Bates eye exercises and Trataka Yoga Kriya on myopia. Materials and Methodology: Ethical clearance {{was obtained from the}} institution, and informed consent was taken from participants. In this randomized comparative study, 24 participants (48 eyes) were taken based on inclusion and exclusion criteria and were randomly divided into two groups: Group A and Group B, where Bates eye exercise therapy and Trataka Yoga Kriya were given, respectively, for 8 weeks. Participants were assessed for their refractive errors and visual acuity pre- and post-intervention. Results: Data were analyzed by SPSS version 20. Results obtained revealed that both Bates exercises and Trataka Yoga Kriya were not significantly effective in reducing refractive errors and in improving visual acuity (P value of refractive error in right eye: 0. 4250; left eye: 0. 4596; P value of visual acuity in right eye: 0. 5691; left eye: 0. 8952).
