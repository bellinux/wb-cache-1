40|$|The {{application}} of combined {{techniques such as}} aerial imagery, sediment coring, down-hole magnetic susceptibility, and mechanized trench excavation can provide critical information on landscape formation and mound stratigraphy, specifically {{if they can be}} used to understand mound sequences and development. This paper reviews preliminary findings from recent coring and test excavations at the Carson mounds site (22 CO 505) in Coahoma County, Mississippi. Aerial imagery assisted in the characterization of a crevasse ridge flood deposit underlying the site and detailed field descriptions of the pedology corroborated its existence. Subsequent sediment coring and trench excavation revealed the nature of flooding in prehistory, indicating that high-intensity floods were responsible for the formation of the crevasse ridge and that lower intensity floods were potentially responsible for interruptions in mound building at the site. This suggests that the Carson settlement was initiated on an actively flooding landform. Down-hole magnetic susceptibility correlated effectively with the pedology; however, it also helped discern anthropogenic surfaces (i. e., occupational layers) that are difficult to identify visually, such as those we found in Mound <b>C.</b> <b>Findings</b> from this pilot study demonstrate the utility of sediment coring and magnetic susceptibility as effective and feasible methods for developing hypothesis-driven research...|$|E

The t-test statistical technique was used to determine whether leadership style, gender, age, years of administrative experience, and highest earned academic degrees had an effect on personal readiness for change. Results revealed that a significant relationship (alpha level of. 05) existed between personal readiness for change and leadership style (p=. 009), and also between personal readiness for change and highest earned academic degrees (p=. 019).

Design/methodology/approach – Case study data were obtained through semi-structured interviews, observation and document analysis in three organisations (Company A, Company B and Company <b>C).</b> <b>Findings</b> – The paper highlights the life-cycle development of technical controls, where controls are implemented, improved and eventually removed. It highlights the fact that the progression through the life-cycle can follow either a dialectical motor of change based on conflict or a teleological motor of change based on consensus. Research limitations/implications – The findings of the paper enhance the theory of rules developed by March et al., by providing insight into how change actually occurs, i. e. how inertia is broken. Practical implications – The paper offers practitioners some guidelines for the management of their control systems to help them maintain more effective and efficient control systems. Originality/value – The paper explains that under a teleological motor of change, inertia is broken more easily than under a dialectical one, because there is less tolerance for control obsolescence, hence improvement and removal of obsolete controls are more likely to occur. This is important for listed organisations having to implement more and more technical controls to comply with laws such as SOX. The paper also suggests that the life-cycle is not a “motor” of change as suggested by Van de Ven and Poole, because it cannot explain how inertia is broken...|$|E

(Lso) were evaluated. Settling and ovipositional behavior of B. cockerelli was studied to determine preference for potato, tomato, pepper, eggplant and silverleaf nightshade (SLN) hosts. Results of field testing indicate resident B. cockerelli preferred potato and tomato equally for settling and oviposition, moving to pepper, eggplant and SLN only {{in the absence of}} potato and tomato. However, under laboratory conditions B. cockerelli adults preferred eggplant, pepper and potato equally, and more than tomato and SLN. Based on psyllid abundance, B. cockerelli were more active during the morning and less active during the afternoon. Preference for larger hosts in terms of size was exhibited, irrespective of the host. Growth and survival of B. cockerelli was better on potato than SLN. Lso-infectivity influenced nymphal survivorship and Lso-free individuals survived better than Lso-infective on both potato and SLN. Contrary to our hypothesis and published literature, psyllids preferred uninfected hosts and, in most cases, did not exhibit any preference for Lso-infected or uninfected potato, tomato or pepper. Results from field studies demonstrated that significantly more resident psyllids settled on uninfected potato plants than Lso-infected plants. Although previous results indicate the importance of olfactory cues to guide psyllid orientation to hosts, our results demonstrate that psyllids more likely use visual cues, preferring healthy and vigorous instead of sick and dying hosts.

40|$|If Yucca Mountain, Nevada is {{designated}} as the site for development of a geologic repository for disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste, the Department of Energy (DOE) must obtain Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approval first for repository construction, then for an operating license, and, eventually, for repository closure and decommissioning. The licensing criteria defined in Code of Federal Regulations, Title 10, Part 63 (10 CFR Part 63) establish the basis for these NRC decisions. Submittal of a license application (LA) to the NRC for authorization to construct a repository at the Yucca Mountain site is, at this point, only a potential future action by the DOE. The policy process defined in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), as amended, for recommendation and designation of Yucca Mountain as a repository site {{makes it difficult to}} predict whether or when the site might be designated. The DOE may only submit a LA to the NRC if the site designation takes effect. In spite of this uncertainty, the DOE must take prudent and appropriate action now, and over the next several years, to prepare for development and timely submittal of a LA. This is particularly true given the need for the DOE to develop, load, and certify the operation of its electronic information system to provide access to its relevant records as part of the licensing support network (LSN) in compliance with NRC requirements six months prior to LA submittal.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM Document-based {{educational}} {{information systems}} require systematic acquisition efforts {{that must be}} conscientiously undertaken to build an information system and to keep it current. These acquisition efforts can be influenced by several variables. The major thrust {{of this research was}} to investigate one of these variables, namely proximity. Simply stated, "What relationships exist between proximal distance and the effectiveness of acquisition techniques?" DEFINITION Proximity - nearness in time, place, and context. Related to familiarity, similarity, and recency. Cognitive proximity is the perception of nearness in time, place, and context. HYPOTHESIS The results of this study do not substantiate accepting the null hypothesis: There is no significant difference in the: (1) number of VI/CM received, (2) their relative acceptability (as measured by a panel), or the (3) elapsed time for receipt of the VI/CM from randomly selected samples of respondents in the letter, phone, and personal visitation groups. METHOD This writer collected vocational instructional/curriculum materials (VI/CM) pertaining to a national curriculum survey project by visiting one randomly selected group of 49 resource people, telephoning another randomly selected group of 72 people, and mailing letters to a third group of 91 randomly selected people. The 121 documents that were collected were then reviewed by five judges to determine their applicability to the project goals. Assessment of the effectiveness of individual acquisition techniques (visit, phone, or letter) was based on: 1. The actual number of documents collected by that particular technique. 2. The number of days that elapsed between the actual request and the receipt of the VI/CM. 3. The relative "applicability" of the VI/CM as rated by the panel of reviewers in terms of the stated project goals (outlined in Appendix <b>C).</b> <b>FINDINGS</b> I. Study results indicate that the visitation technique {{is by far the most}} effective means of acquiring VI/CM. 2. The mail technique is of a one-way communication type. It is the most economical for large numbers of sources, but it was also the least acceptable of the three techniques in terms of its yield. 3. The telephone technique allows for two-way communication. It has the capability of developing trust, cooperation, and cognitive proximity. However, as is the case with the mail technique, the phone technique requires that the resource person initiate some action after the conversation; i. e. he must gather the desired VI/CM and mail them. The person may or may not follow through with this action. 4. The visitation technique was demonstrated to be the most efficient technique used in this study. The two-way verbal and visual communication that characterizes visitation, together with the physical proximity of the surveyor to the resource person, allowed for the development of unit relationships which seemingly resulted in trust or cooperation. CONCLUSION This study is sufficiently suggestive to warrant belief in a positive relationship between acquisition-system effectiveness and the formation of cognitive proximity between the resource person and the surveyor...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 This {{research}} was conducted to compare the performance {{of community college students}} to four -year institutional students both of which were enrolled in one of three different programs of general college chemistry for nonscience majors during the 1967 - 68 academic year. The three programs were defined as follows: Program A - A Chemistry course for those students who have: 1. No high school chemistry background or; 2. A college board (S. A. T.) score of 451 or less in mathematics, or; 3. A total college board (S. A. T.) score of 861 or less in mathematics plus verbal or; 4. A high school grade point average (G. P. A.) of less than 2. 5 (4. 0 equals perfect) This program is designed as an introductory elementary course of nine quarter hours credit and is a terminal course to be taken only by students who will not go on to take higher level chemistry courses. Program B - This course is designed for students with the same background and scores as those in Program A, but who do plan to go on and take higher level chemistry courses. This course is a minimum of twelve quarter hours. The greater number of hours will allow a more thorough approach and provide a better background. Program C - A chemistry course for those students who have: 1. High school chemistry background and; 2. A college board (S. A. T.) score of 452 or above in mathematics, and; 3. A total college board (S. A. T.) score of 862 or above in mathematics plus verbal or; 4. A high school chemistry background and a high school grade point average (G. P. A.) of 2. 5 or above (4. 0 equals perfect) This course is designed for the science related majors (engineering, forestry, etc.) but not for science majors (chemistry, pre -medical, etc.). It is a modern, and strictly college level general chemistry course in which the majority of general chemistry students are enrolled. The objectives of this program {{are similar to those of}} Program B in that the course is designed to prepare students for additional courses in chemistry. Therefore, the criterion instruments used in Program C were identical to those used in Program B. Near the completion of these programs, measurements, of student performance from the two types of institutions, were taken in terms of two important objectives of chemistry teaching; critical thinking ability and knowledge of facts and principles. The criterion instruments used to measure these objectives were: The Cornell Critical Thinking Test, Form Z, developed by R. Ennis and J. Millman, and two knowledge of facts and principles tests developed by the researcher. To assure that the students from the two types of institutions, within the three programs, were comparable before the differential experimental treatment, they were matched by S. A. T. math scores or, where these were not available, high school math grade point averages were used. The population for this investigation consisted of full -time students enrolled in one of the three different general college chemistry programs at either of four community colleges or two four -year institutions in Oregon. In Program A there were a total of 188 community college students and the same number of four -year institutional students. Similarly, there were 70 from each of the two types of institutions for Program B and 174 from each type for Program <b>C.</b> <b>Findings</b> The findings from this research were based on results of an analysis of variance statistical design with F values computed at the 5 percent level. 1. There was no significant statistical difference between community college and four -year institutional general chemistry Program A in terms of student critical thinking ability and student knowledge of facts and principles of chemistry. 2. There was no significant statistical difference between community college and four -year institutional general chemistry Program B in terms of student critical thinking ability. 3. There was a significant statistical difference between one of the four -year institutions and all the other participating institutions in terms of student knowledge of facts and principles of chemistry for Program B. It was concluded that a significant factor influencing this finding was the procedural difference in course offering between the one four -year institution and all of the other participating colleges. For the one four -year institution Program B was offered in three sequential quarters in contrast to the other colleges offering Program B in 4 quarters, three of which were sequential and a fourth offered sometime the next year. It was the conclusion of the author that this break in course continuity significantly impeded the success of students in Program B in terms of knowledge of facts and principles in chemistry. 4.

The milling time and the revolution speed were tuned in order to maximize the critical current density in field (Jc) : the maximum Jc value of 6 x 10 e 4 A/cm 2 at 5 K and 4 T was obtained corresponding to the tape prepared with powders milled for 144 h at 180 rpm. Vorious synthesis temperature were also investigated (730 - 900 <b>C)</b> <b>finding</b> a best Jc value for the wire prepared with powders synthesized at 745 C. We speculate that this optimal temperature is due to the fluidifying effect of unreacted magnesium content before the sintering process which could better connect the grains...|$|R
40|$|URL] audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} construction of optimal experimental designs (approximate theory) on a compact subset X of Rd with nonempty interior, for a concave and Lipschitz diff erentiable design criterion Phi (.) {{based on the information}} matrix. The proposed algorithm combines (a) convex optimization for the determination of optimal weights on a support set, (b) sequential updating of this support using local optimization, and (<b>c)</b> <b>finding</b> new support candidates using properties of the directional derivative of Phi(.). The algorithm makes use of the compactness of X and relies on a fi nite grid Xl C X for checking optimality. By exploiting the Lipschitz continuity of the directional derivatives of Phi(.), effi ciency bounds on X are obtained and epsilon-optimality on X is guaranteed. The eff ectiveness of the method is illustrated on a series of examples...|$|R
