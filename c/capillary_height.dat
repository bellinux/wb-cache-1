40|$|Gas-oil gravity {{drainage}} {{is considered to}} be one of the most dependable recovery mechanisms in naturally fractured reservoirs. The production mechanism is as a result of the density difference between the phases and capillary contrast between the matrixes and the fractures. This mechanism is contingent upon certain factors such as <b>capillary</b> threshold <b>height</b> and <b>capillary</b> discontinuity, among others. To assess the efficiency and contributions of these factors, a simulation study was carried out on a modeled fractured porous system using ECLIPSE- 100 simulator. The results obtained show that oil recovery from a single matrix block (RUN 1) was higher than matrix blocks with two, three and five stacks with capillary continuity (RUNS 2, 3 and 4 respectively). Additionally, with capillary discontinuity (RUNS 5, 6 and 7), the results depicted an increase in oil recovery compared to the cases of capillary continuity. However, varying the degree of capillary discontinuity with the respective matrix block stacks in the fractured model yielded no significant increase in oil recovery.

40|$|International audienceThe micro-pulling-down (mu-PD) process {{consists}} in pulling a crystal under a capillary channel {{placed at the}} bottom of a crucible. Despite it being limited to rather small liquid volumes, it is used to grow single crystal fibers and shaped crystals of various cross sections, mainly applied industrially for optical applications, such as lasers, optics, or scintillators. Consequently, those crystals should be doped with active elements to fit the target application. Unfortunately, whatever the growth parameters and the dopant type, quite often segregation problems are observed. It is generally believed that chemical partition in mu-PD technique is restricted to the first grown millimeters, but some experiments show that it is not always the case. An analytical one-dimensional model is presented, aiming to predict the longitudinal segregation along the growth direction. It is shown that it depends in practice on growth parameters such as <b>capillary</b> length, meniscus <b>height,</b> <b>capillary</b> section, and pulling rate.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study is}} presented on {{the shape of}} the interface between coexisting isotropic and nematic phases in contact with a solid vertical wall. The interface profile is determined by a competition between three surface tensions, two anchoring strengths, gravity, and the Frank elastic constants of the director field. In the weak-anchoring limit, the director field is rigid and uniform, and we find the <b>capillary</b> rise <b>height</b> to depend nontrivially on the orientation of the director field relative to the solid-fluid interface. For strong surface anchoring, the director field adjusts to the preferred homeotropic or planar anchoring at the solid-liquid and liquid-liquid interfaces. The shape of the interfacial profile is now a function of the balance between the surface energy and the splay and bend elastic deformation energies. Interestingly, for both weak and strong anchoring the profile decays nonmonotonically albeit only very weakly so. We compare our theory with recent capillary rise experiments on coexisting isotropic and nematic phases of colloidal platelets [van der Beek et al. Phys. Rev.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Deformation of a fluid {{interface}} {{caused by}} the presence of objects at the interface can lead to large lateral forces between objects. We explore these fluid-mediated attractive force between partially submerged vertical cylinders. Forces are experimentally measured by slowly separating cylinder pairs and cylinder triplets after capillary rise is initially established for cylinders in contact. For cylinder pairs, numerical computations and a theoretical model are found to be in good agreement with measurements. The model provides insight into the relative importance of the contributions to the total force. For small separations, the lateral force is dominated by the fluid pressure acting over the wetted cylinder surfaces. At large separations, the surface tension acting along the contact line dominates the lateral force. A crossover between the two regimes occurs at a separation of around half of a capillary length. The experimentally measured forces between cylinder triplets are also in good agreement with numerical computations, and we show that pairwise contributions account for nearly all of the attractive force between triplets.

To overcome materialistic limitation, accident tolerant fuel (ATF) was suggested to improve safety response of nuclear power plants during accidents by modifying cladding surface with various coating materials. When chrome was coated on cladding surface, it showed fewer weight gain by high temperature oxidation compared to bare zirconium cladding. Chrome forms chrome oxide or chromia (Cr 2 O 3) when oxidized, and this layer prevents further oxidation thus protecting inner material from oxidizing. However, previous studies indicated that implementation of chrome containing alloys have major drawbacks such as excessive coating thickness or degraded critical heat flux (CHF). Instead, direct coating of chromia was suggested in this study with the expectation of CHF enhancement compared to other chrome alloy coatings. Chromia nanoparticles were coated on nichrome wire surface with boiling deposition of chromia nanofluid. Another method was applying RF sputtering with chromia target. Chrome coating with DC sputtering were also tested for comparison.

Since deformations of this kind will occur regularly when soils are tilled or wheeled with machinery the question was raised how such events would change soil capillary properties. Circular capillaries with a concave inner surface were compared to the ones with a convex inner surface. They were formed by the fixing of either three or four rods with circular diameter together. Perimeters and crosssectional areas were calculated and the height of capillary rise was measured by two independent methods. For comparison, the results of wetting angles were used.

The infiltration was sprayed uniformly at the soil&# 13; surface with the constant rate of 66. 1 and 7. 18 cm 3 /h for sand and soil columns, respectively. The redistribution process was&# 13; developed by which water arriving at the column base enter to the sand/soil column due to capillary rise. The laboratory&# 13; observations were simulated using the developed model. The results indicate that the developed model could well estimate&# 13; the movement of water in the infiltration-redistribution system that observed in the case study and the experiments...|$|E
40|$|The plant {{wilting point}} is {{generally}} believed to occur at a matric potential value of - 1500 kPa for all plant species in all environments. In this study, I strive {{to illustrate how}} varied the plant wilting point can actually be and to show how using a constant value for all species may {{be a source of}} error. Matric potential values are determined through the use of the van Genuchten soil water characteristic curves, where each soil has its own curve. Additionally, the maximum depth of the groundwater table was studied. The maximum depth was determined based on the rooting depth of the plant species and the height of the capillary fringe water at the plant wilting point. Since no acceptable calculation for capillary fringe height at plant wilting could be found in the literature, my own technique is presented here. It involves the use of the <b>capillary</b> <b>height</b> equation presented by El-Kadi and Ling, which was taken as the maximum height of the capillary fringe in a soil. Then, a relationship between the volumetric water content at the plant wilting point and the capillary fringe height was developed and employed. Summing the rooting depth and the capillary fringe height resulted in the maximum depth of the groundwater table. Data was collected through a literature review and was categorized based on twelve soil types, four ecoregions, and three vegetation classes. These categories allowed me to identify patterns within subsets of data points. Based on these patterns, guidance tables for managing the groundwater table depth are presented...|$|E
40|$|Nanostructured {{films were}} {{successfully}} deposited on various wick samples including conventional screen materials, engineered single and dual-mode wicks which are specially designed to augment {{boiling heat transfer}} performance. Microreactor-assisted nanomaterial deposition, MANDTM, was employed with a flow cell to deposit the nanostructures on large wick shims (4. 3 cm Χ 10. 7 cm). <b>Capillary</b> rise experiments, <b>height</b> based measurement and weight gain method, were performed to characterize wicking dynamics in nano-coated and “bare ” capillary wicks with water and ethanol. The results indicate that nanocoated wick is most efficient for ethanol {{in terms of the}} enhancement of capillary force. Analytical and numerical analyses based on Lucas Washburn equation were performed to model the capillary rise. Data from the height measurement were in a good agreement with both numerical and analytical solutions. Capillary rise of water on engineered multi-mode wicks displayed a step-rise in the wicking front. Flow boiling tests were also performed to characterize heat transfer from nano-coated wicks for application in energy conversion systems as compact evaporators. Experimental results indicate that the nanostructured wicks enhance heat transfer, reduce superheat required and operate stably when compared with “bare ” wicks and conventional microchannels...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} at low {{velocities}} {{the dynamics of}} a contact line of a water drop moving over a Teflon-like surface under ac electrowetting must be described as stick–slip motion, rather than one continuous movement. At high velocities we observe a transition to a slipping regime. In the slipping regime the observed dependence of the contact angle is well described by a linearization of both the hydrodynamic and the molecular-kinetic model for the dynamic contact line behavior. The overall geometry of the drop also has a strong influence on the contact angle: if the drop is confined to a disk-like shape with radius R, {{much larger than the}} <b>capillary</b> length, and <b>height</b> h, smaller than the capillary length, the advancing angle increases steeper with velocity as the aspect ratio h/R is smaller. Although influence of the flow field near a contact line on the contact angle behavior has also been observed in other experiments, these observations do not fit either model. Finally, in our ac experiments no sudden increase of the hysteresis beyond a certain voltage and velocity was observed, as reported by other authors for a dc voltage, but instead we find with increasing voltage a steady decrease of the hysteresi...|$|R
40|$|A {{miniature}} {{gas chromatography}} (GC) system {{was designed and}} fabricated using silicon micromachining and integrated circuit (IC) processing techniques. The silicon micromachined gas chromatography system (SMGCS) is composed of a miniature sample injector that incorporates a 10 microliter sample loop; a 0. 9 meter long, rectangular shaped (300 micrometer width and 10 micrometer <b>height)</b> <b>capillary</b> column coated with a 0. 2 micrometer thick copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) stationary phase; and a dual detector scheme based upon a CuPc-coated chemiresistor and a commercially available 125 micrometer diameter thermal conductivity detector (TCD) bead. Silicon micromachining was employed to fabricate the interface between the sample injector and the GC column, the column itself, and the dual detector cavity. A novel IC thin-film processing technique was developed to sublime the CuPc stationary phase coating on the column walls that were micromachined in the host silicon wafer substrate and Pyrex (r) cover plate, which were then electrostatically bonded together. The SMGCS can separate binary gas mixtures composed of parts-per-million (ppm) concentrations of ammonia (NH 3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) when isothermally operated (55 - 80 degrees C). With a helium carrier gas and nitrogen diluent, a 10 microliter sample volume containing ammonia and nitrogen dioxide injected at 40 psi ((2. 8 x 10 (exp 5) Pa)) can be separated in less than 30 minutes...|$|R
