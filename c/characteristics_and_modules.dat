40|$|Membrane {{distillation}} (MD) is {{a recent}} and unique separation technology, in use in the process industry. The process of separation in MD involves the simultaneous heat and mass transfer through a hydrophobic semi permeable membrane, using thermal energy. Consequently a separation of the feed solution into two components - the permeate or product and the retentate or the return stream occurs. MD utilises low grade or alternative energy, e. g., solar energy, geothermal energy, etc., as a source and is the most cost effective separation technology. Hence the process has come to acquire the attention and interest of researchers, experimentalists and theoreticians all over the world. This article is {{a comprehensive review of}} the prominent research in the field of MD technology, including its basic principle, MD configurations, area of applications, membrane <b>characteristics</b> <b>and</b> <b>modules,</b> experimental studies involving the effect of main operating parameters, MD energy and economic, fouling and long-term performance.

The first node typically generates or stores raw datasets and a remote client resides {{on the last}} node equipped with a display device ranging from a personal desktop to a powerwall.

40|$|Reliable and {{reproducible}} epitaxy (epi) {{materials are}} {{critical to the success}} of a high volume compound semiconductor fabrication line. An efficient epi matching and qualification procedure among different epi reactors and suppliers is paramount to supporting rapid fab capacity ramp to keep pace with market demands. Traditional methods of individual layer thickness and doping matching, such as Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS), have limitations when applied to heterojunctions and subtle interface matching. Sometimes a subtle epi interface mismatch can create significant discrepancies in transistor <b>characteristics</b> <b>and</b> RF <b>module</b> performance. Multiple iterations of lengthy epi matching as well as RF module level characterization may be required to resolve the differences. To overcome these limitations, we developed an epi matching procedure which greatly shortened the cycle time for epi qualification. After an initial “quick-lot ” matching is performed by our suppliers, extensive transistor level electrical data is collected and compared to the historical production distribution. The measured data of these qualification samples must be within 2. 5 sigma of the historical distribution with the same mean. The in-line DC PCM parameters, for the technology generation, are a subset collected data. In addition, an extended set of DC and RF parameters is also matched within the same stringent criteria. After the transistor level electrical data fully matches the historical distribution of our database, the qualification samples then go through transistor level reliability <b>and</b> <b>module</b> level evaluations. Adequate transistor level reliability <b>and</b> comparable <b>module</b> level performance are required for a full production release of a new epi reactor...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Carto-modelling is a semi-distributed {{technique}} with {{a strong}} physical basis. It bridges the gap between qualitative maps and mathematical models in hydrology. In carto-modelling terrain and hydrological information are abstracted in a flow diagram (the carto-model) which consists of three elements: hydropedons, hydrogeons, and channel sections. A hydropedon is both a mapping unit, defined by ecosystem <b>characteristics,</b> <b>and</b> a modelling <b>module</b> with spatially uniform hydro-pedological behaviour: a hydrogeon is defined analogously for the underlying hydrogeological zone. The carto-model displays the structure and internal fluxes of a hydrolo-gical system more fully than found on hydrological maps, and is thus a valuable tool for land and water resources management.

These functors factor through the module category of the Auslander algebra of Λ. Moreover they induce equivalences from the quotient categories of the submodule category modulo their respective kernels and said kernels have finitely many indecomposable objects up to isomorphism. Their construction uses a recollement of the module category of the Auslander algebra induced by an idempotent and this recollement determines a <b>characteristic</b> tilting <b>and</b> cotilting <b>module.</b> If Λ is taken to be a Nakayama algebra, then said tilting <b>and</b> cotilting <b>module</b> is a characteristic tilting module of a quasi-hereditary structure on the Auslander algebra.

Qualitative data were obtained using the ASSIST questionnaire, by focus group discussions and an open-ended questionnaire on students’ experiences of the transition to higher education (HE). Quantitative data on student <b>characteristics</b> <b>and</b> <b>module</b> results were obtained from Registry. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 10. The study comprised two phases where phase one sought to enable the early detection of students at risk of poor performance by investigating the data set for patterns that may emerge between student achievement at Level 1 and entrance qualification, feeder institution, approaches to learning, conceptions of learning, course and teaching preferences and motivation. Phase one findings showed a trend of poorer performance by students who entered computing courses in HE with an AVCE entrance qualification. It was also shown that mature students scored more highly on the deep approach scale compared to their younger counterparts. Phase two investigated the data set for patterns that may emerge between student achievement at Level 2 and entrance qualification, approaches to learning, conceptions of learning and course and teaching preferences. Phase two, using action research, also sought to develop an intervention programme from the findings. This intervention programme was designed to improve aspects of information delivery to students; the personal tutor system, assessment régimes, Welcome Week, and teaching and learning. Piloting, evaluation and refinement of the intervention programme brought changes that were seen as positive by both staff and students. These changes included the Welcome Week Challenge which involved students in activities that sought to enhance students’ interactions with peers, personal tutors and the school and university facilities. These findings have shown that, for staff in wide access HE institutions, some knowledge of the previous educational experiences of their students, and the requirements of those students, are vital in providing a smooth transition to HE.

40|$|Submerged {{membrane}} bioreactor (MBR) processes for treating municipal or industrial wastewater {{are one of}} the most promising applications of microfiltration membranes. Previous studies were spread over various fields of research including water science, microbiology, chemical engineering, material science and process control. All of the above research societies contributed comprehensively to a further improvement of the technology. Nevertheless, it is known that higher operational expenses compared to conventional water treatment strategies weaken the competitiveness of MBRs. More precisely, recent energy efficiency analyses identified the coarse bubble aeration of the membrane unit to consume the biggest proportion of the overall energy input. Therefore, hydrodynamic conditions in submerged microfiltration processes were investigated experimentally and numerically on three different scales in the framework of this study. The overall objective was to evaluate the impact of operating parameters, feed <b>characteristics</b> <b>and</b> <b>module</b> design features on the efficiency of air bubbling to control cake layer formation. On a micro-scale, local phenomena such as permeate flow, particle deposition and cake removal were non-invasively visualised with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging. Complementary filtration experiments were conducted by applying a number of test facilities equipped with single hollow-fibres (meso-scale) or single hollow-fibre bundles (macro-scale) in different modes of operation. The bubble-induced fibre movement as a key parameter affecting the overall process performance was tracked with a direct observation (DO) technique (meso-scale). A macroscopic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach based on X-ray computer tomography (CT) scans and calibrated with numerical pressure loss correlations was established. The investigations have shown the impact of lumen-side pressure losses on the distribution of local permeate flux. Cake formation appeared to be heterogeneous, with thicker cakes close to the point of permeate extraction. The cake growth was in good agreement with the fouling rate dTMP/dt as a function of permeate flux, solids concentration and aeration conditions. Cake layer removal was enhanced with an increase in net aeration rate, bubble-induced fibre movement and background circulation flow. Interestingly, a higher aeration frequency for the same net aeration rate and an optimal gross aeration rate were observed, which outlines potentials for reducing aeration requirements. Fibre motion was more intensive for higher aeration rates, but insensitive to packing density variations. The CFD results were indicating a clear impact of fibre arrangement, superficial inlet velocity and solids concentration on the local cross-flow velocity and turbulence intensity. A well-defined slug flow was observed before the Taylor bubble penetrates into the porous medium. Moving forward, different module configurations will be evaluated with CFD, thus providing insights into the complex multi-phase flow pattern which are not accessible with experimental observation techniques...|$|R

In particular, we answer the question when the Ringel dual of a properly stratified algebra is properly stratified itself, and show that the class of properly stratified algebras for which the <b>characteristic</b> tilting <b>and</b> cotilting <b>modules</b> coincide is closed under taking the Ringel dual. Studying stratified algebras, whose Ringel dual is properly stratified, we discover a new Ringel-type duality for such algebras, which we call the two-step duality. This duality arises from the existence of a new (generalized) tilting module for stratified algebras with properly stratified Ringel dual. We show that this new tilting module has a lot of interesting properties, for instance, its projective dimension equals the projectively defined finitistic dimension of the original algebra, it guarantees that the category of modules of finite projective dimension is contravariantly finite, and, finally, it allows one to compute the finitistic dimension of the original algebra in terms of the projective dimension of the characteristic tilting module. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Reference data in {{technical}} literature about such <b>characteristics</b> as stiffness <b>and</b> elasticity of rail threads at torsion are rather contradictory. This {{is due to}} the absence of correct analytical solution of this task and because of complexity of experimental studies of this problem under combined action of vertical and horizontal lateral forces. The article presents the new method of solving the task of calculation the real values of stiffness <b>and</b> elasticity <b>modules</b> of rail thread when torsion under combined action of vertical and horizontal lateral forces. Methodology. The complex method of solving the problem was used in the paper. It includes the theoretical part and the results of the experiment. Using the experiment the characteristics of horizontal lateral stiffness of the rail threads of the head and bottom at different constructions of the modern rail fastenings was measured. The second task of determination of the real values of elasticity and stiffness modulus of the rail thread when torsion was solved by the theoretical methods. Findings. New values of stiffness <b>characteristics</b> <b>and</b> elasticity <b>module</b> of rail thread when torsion for the modern rail constrictions Р 65, UIC 60, Р 50 and the rail fastenings of the types КПП, КБ, ДО, under combined action of vertical and horizontal forces and torsion were obtained. Originality. For the first time in domestic research it was carried out the experimental and theoretical solution of the task for determination of the real values of the stiffness and elasticity modulus of rail thread when torsion under combined action of vertical and horizontal forces of the wheel loadings. The solution is represented in the functional dependence on the correlation of vertical and horizontal forces; acting together. The solution is carried out for the modern designs of the rails of domestic standard P 65, P 50, P 43 and international standard UIC 60. Practical value. The obtained results make it possible to carry out calculations of the real acting strains and deformations in the rails of different types under the joint action of vertical and horizontal forces for railway track on concrete and wooden sleepers with different designs of rigid and elastic rail fastenings КБ, КПП, Д 0 with higher accuracy as compared to the current calculation methodology...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{the main features}} of a performance monitoring system which supervises more than 1200 loops of refinery plants. The system analyses data recorded by the DCS during routine operations and originates verdicts about the performance of control loops; also, indications of low performance causes and different strategies to adopt (retuning, valve maintenance, upstream actions) are given. First, {{the architecture of the}} system is illustrated, <b>and</b> <b>characteristics</b> of <b>modules</b> which accomplish different tasks of data acquisition and transfer, system configuration and priority assignment, performance analysis and verdicts emission, database query and operator support, are described. A synthesis of main techniques adopted in the system for stiction detection, process identification and performance evaluation, is also reported. The procedure for calibration of threshold values of key parameters, in order to match verdicts issued automatically by the system with operators evaluations and to avoid false alarms, is also discussed. Examples of results achieved from field validation are then presented, with illustration of loop performance before and after actions suggested by the monitoring system...|$|R
