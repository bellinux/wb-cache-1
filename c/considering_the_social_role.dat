40|$|Carsharing (CS) is {{increasing}} its role worldwide {{as an alternative}} transport mode, often more sustainable than private transport with self-owned vehicles. We first focus on the main characteristics of those services and on the impacts they generated, starting from the analysis of  the literature on this topic. CS initiatives are growing everywhere, however numbers are still minor and impacts are still far from a level that can deliver significant aggregate benefits. This paper studies the existing Italian carsharing experiences, trying to understand its strengths, that have allowed its development, but also possible limits and weaknesses. The presence of a national coordination structure (Iniziativa Carsharing - ICS), unique in Europe and created to boost local initiatives providing standardisation and interoperability, surely helped {{the development of the}} system. Some initiatives have been successful in terms of membership (in particular Milan, Venice and Turin), but others have been discontinued. Italian users’ characteristics are similar to the ones of users abroad: the majority of users are well educated male, living in small households having one or no cars and using public transport every day. At present, Italian drivers generally still show a scarce propensity to share their cars, considered more as “goods” than as “services”. A case study in Milan, the first and most successful initiative in Italy, shows a significant increase in CS membership after the implementation of a city charging scheme (“Ecopass” at first, then “Area C”). Moving shared cars from garages to “on the street parking” has proved successful too. The usage of the service has changed in time: users have increased (+ 151 %) more than runs (+ 137 %) – 2006 to 2009, while average length and duration of each run have decreased (- 30 % and - 43 % respectively, 2006 to 2010). Milan’s initiative also put s into practice many incentives for users that likely contributed to its success, i. e. free access to limited traffic zones, use of public transport reserved lanes, free parking in tolled spaces and discounts on the annual fee for public transport season ticket holders. The result of CS initiatives in the future will likely depend largely on mobility policies that both the national government and municipalities will introduce in the future. A legislation concerning CS is needed in order to promote the involvement of private initiatives, while mobility policies should evidence the advantages, both in economical and practical terms, offered by CS with respect to a private car, also <b>considering</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>role</b> that CS might have for low-income households (and students), that could have access to a car on a “pay as you use” principle. CS benefits from broader transport policies and can improve their social acceptability, by integrating existing public transport systems – in terms of flexibility, land coverage and availability in time. </p...|$|E

40|$|MBA - WBSThe {{impact of}} HIV/AIDS on {{employee}} risk benefits represents {{a threat to}} <b>the</b> <b>social</b> security of <b>the</b> majority of South African employees. The economic dimension of the disease is manifested in prohibitive cost increases and declining value of employee risk benefits. The key challenge is to balance the need for adequate and affordable insurance for HIV positive employees, against {{the need to protect}} other employees from unfair risk distribution policies. This paper evaluates existing literature and <b>considers</b> <b>the</b> response of the insurance industry by looking at theoretical principles, historical lessons, scientific evidence, and <b>the</b> changing <b>social</b> environment, from <b>the</b> perspectives of the different stakeholders. The consolidation of this work suggests that sustainable responses are best achieved by primarily exploring cost containment measures rather than cost shifting exercises.

40|$|Abstract Technologies {{fulfill a}} <b>social</b> <b>role</b> in <b>the</b> {{sense that they}} {{influence}} the moral actions of people, often in unintended and unforeseen ways. Scientists and engineers are already accepting much responsibility for the technological, economical and environmental aspects of their work. This article asks them to take an extra step, and now also <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>role</b> of their products. The aim is to enable engineers to take a prospective responsibility for <b>the</b> future <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> of their technologies by providing them with a matrix that helps to explore in advance how emerging technologies might plausibly affect the reasons behind people’s (moral) actions. On the horizontal axis of the matrix, we distinguished the three basic types of reasons that {{play a role in}} practical judgment: what is the case, what can be done and what should be done. On the vertical axis we distinguished the morally relevant classes of issues: stakeholders, consequences and the good life. To illustrate how this matrix may work in practice, the final section applies the matrix to the case of the Google PowerMeter...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} interest and debate in recent years on the instituted nature of economic processes {{in general and the}} related ideas of the market, in particular the competitive process. This debate lies at the interface between two largely independent disciplines, economics and sociology, and reflects an attempt to bring the two fields of discourse more closely together. This book explores this interface in a number of ways, looking at the competitive process and market relations from a number of different perspectives. It includes a wide range of contributors, most of whom are leading writers and thinkers in the field. <b>The</b> book <b>considers</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>role</b> of economic institutions in society and examines the various meanings embedded in the word 'markets', as well as developing arguments on the nature of competition as an instituted economic process, rather than as competition being something that disturbs norms or institutions. It goes on to <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> deeper and more involved connection between markets and cognition, explaining how institutions can ease cognitive difficulties, and the effect of culture on markets and competition is also fully studied. This book will be of vital use to students and academics working in the fields of economics, sociology and business studies. It sketches the agenda for future research about markets and the competitive process...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: During {{intervention}} with children, physical therapists must <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>roles</b> and emotional needs of individual children {{and be able}} to engage children in activities through the use of play. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine one pediatric physical therapist 2 ̆ 7 s use of play during intervention. Participant: The participant was a Pediatric Clinical Specialist with over 30 years of pediatric experience who practiced in a pediatric rehabilitation program. Methods and Materials: Qualitative, descriptive case study methodology was used. Data were gathered through (1) one-on-one semistructured interviews with the participant,(2) direct observation of the participant during intervention sessions with children, and (3) one-on-one interviews with parents of children receiving intervention from the participant. Analyses: Audio-recordings of the interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Trustworthiness was established through the use of member checking procedures, peer review, triangulation of data sources, and a reflexive journal. Results: Findings revealed that the participant used play to create social connections and interpersonal relationships with children and their families. A theoretical model was developed to depict the participant s decision-making processes in using therapeutic play. Conclusions: The participant s use of play appeared to provide a foundation for improved compliance during intervention sessions and thus may have facilitated progress toward physical therapy goals and outcomes. The model created from this data can be used to teach students and novice pediatric physical therapists ways to use play therapeutically during intervention sessions and will assist experienced pediatric physical therapists to reflect upon their own therapeutic use of play...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Family and {{community}} medicine (FM) became a recognized specialty in Spain in 1978; however, most medical schools in Spain still lack mandatory core courses in FM. In order {{to explore the}} perceptions, expectations and level of information amongst medical students in Spain in relation to FM and PC, and the training in these areas in the curriculum of the Medical Schools, a survey was developed to be administered in medical schools every two years. This article presents data from the first questionnaire administration. Methods The study population was all first-, third-, and fifth-year students (2009 – 2010) in 22 participating medical schools in Spain (of 27 total). The 83 -item survey had three sections: personal data, FM training, professional practice expectations, and preferences). Chi-squared test or analyses of variance were used, as appropriate. Results We had a 41. 8 % response rate (n[*]=[*] 5299 / 12924); 89. 8 % <b>considered</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>role</b> of FM to be essential, while only 20 % believed the specialty was well respected within the medical profession. The appeal of FM increased with years of study, independent of student characteristics or medical school attended. Among third and fifth-year students, 54. 6 % said their specialty preferences had changed during medical school; 73. 6 % felt that FM specialists should teach FM courses, and 83. 3 % thought that FM rotations in primary care centres were useful. Conclusions Students valued <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>role</b> of FM more highly than its scientific standing. The vast majority believe that FM training should be mandatory. Only 25 % of first-year students have clear preferences for a specialization. Interest in FM increases moderately over their years of study. Working conditions in FM have decisive influence in choosing a specialty. </p...|$|R
40|$|This essay explores {{religious}} indifference as {{an example}} of that which stands beyond <b>the</b> scope of <b>social</b> scientific knowledge production. In turn, it uses religious indifference to <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> scientist’s <b>role</b> in constituting the religion-related field. The literary character Bartleby and the ethnographic character Gino provide two case studies for examining particular types of religious indifference that cannot be known to the researcher. As fictions, they offer a way to explore that which would otherwise remain illegible, and they serve as humbling reminders of the inescapable limits of inquiry. To better understand the role that researchers play in constituting the religion-related field, this essay relies on other ethnographic examples to compare differing notions of “entanglement” and their implications for the study of nonbelievers and the nonreligious. The essay concludes by offering researchers a choice: to pursue religious indifference or to leave it alone...|$|R

40|$|The article, on {{the basis}} {{primarily}} of periodic press publications, examines whether {{the participants in the}} various ideological discourses of the late 19 th–early 20 th century recognised women as equal participants in public life and how their attitudes influenced the development of the national movement and the spread of ideological doctrines. During {{the last decade of the}} 19 th century, representatives of the Catholic community were the first to begin speaking about the necessity of publicly active women in the national rebirth movement and claiming that the education of the community and the dissemination of the national press were a woman’s job in the national movement. In the early 20 th century Catholics began to be more strongly affected by the ideas of Christian democracy, especially by the encyclical Rerum Novarum. Fearing a disintegration of individual Christian values and of the family institution, they did not promote the ideas of the equality of the sexes and personal freedom. But by speaking out for women’s education, their acquiring of a profession, and their cultural work, they in actuality created a conception of active and independent women. The participants in the liberal discourse of the late 19 th century employed the principles of nationalism more than those of classical liberalism. They subordinated the realisation of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>role</b> of women to the sphere of the family, i. e., to the roles of wife and mother that they performed. The categories of individual freedom and equality became important in liberal discourse in the early 20 th century. The task, raised at that time, to inspire the civil initiative of women affirmed the necessity for women to work with men in the public sphere as equals. It is logical that at this time the ideas of equal political rights began to be raised and the prospect of political activity of women started to be <b>considered.</b> <b>The</b> <b>social</b> <b>role</b> of women became the subject of public debates among <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> Democrats only in the early 20 th century, and it was immediately affected very strongly by the conception of the development of a socialist society. <b>The</b> <b>Social</b> Democrats treated <b>the</b> inequality of women workers as an integral part of the socio-economic exploitation of the working class and sought to promote the role of female workers as fighters against the economic exploitation of the working class. In their view, only the creation of a socialist structure would allow the equality of the sexes to arise in both the family and the public sphere...|$|R
40|$|Insects {{living in}} groups {{comprising}} of individuals {{from more than}} one generation, most of whom give up reproduction in favour of one or a few members of their group, but cooperate in rearing the resulting brood are termed eusocial (Michener, 1969; Wilson, 1971). In the highly eusocial insects such as all termites, most ants and some bees and wasps the non-reproductives are morphologically distinct castes who have little or no reproductive opportunities. Such morphological differences often extend to subcastes among workers as well. This leads to efficient division of labour and stable social organization. Such morphologically distinct castes are however absent in most primitively eusocial bees and wasps. Here adult wasps or bees are <b>considered</b> totipotent because <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>roles,</b> including that of the egg layer, that members of a colony can undertake are flexible. In the absence of morphological castes why do certain individuals accept the role of workers and how are the division of labour and social organization achieved...|$|R

40|$|A field {{known as}} oncofertility {{provides}} female cancer {{patients with a}} variety of ways to preserve their fertility so that they may bear genetically related children after successful cancer treatment. Some women delay cancer therapy so doctors can collect their eggs, which are then cryopreserved in an unfertilized state or used to create embryos through in vitro fertilization for freezing. An experimental procedure for preserving the fertility of prepubertal girls, known as ovarian tissue cryopreservation, involves surgically removing their ovarian tissue and growing the immature eggs to a mature state so they can be frozen and stored until the girls are old enough to bear a child. Ethical questions raised by fertility preservation are not confined to the clinic and bedside; rather, these questions extend to the impact of fertility preservation on society and <b>the</b> way <b>social</b> forces influence women 2 ̆ 7 s decisions about their fertility. Gender, class, and race inequities help determine the reproductive options available to these women, including their access to assisted reproductive technologies, and the consequences that their childbearing decisions have for them, their families, and their communities. The uses and outcomes of novel technologies like oncofertility treatment are determined by their <b>social</b> context at <b>the</b> same time that these technologies have an impact on society. <b>Considering</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>social</b> context plays in the ethics of fertility preservation reveals several paradoxical tensions that policy makers will have to resolve. There are compelling ethical reasons to restore to women cancer survivors the capacity to have a child so easily preserved for men and for the public to support wide access to this restoration. Yet an investigation of the underlying structural injustices that place women in conditions of infertility, poor health, and inadequate access to medical care raise questions about the just distribution of public resources used to pay for oncofertility and other health care services...|$|R
