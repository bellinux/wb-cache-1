500|$|Darla {{is first}} {{killed in the}} seventh episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In that episode, it is {{revealed}} that Darla was once romantically involved with Angel and that she made him a vampire. Angel stakes her through the heart. Benz was asked {{to return to the}} role three years later, but not on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Joss Whedon wanted her to appear on the spin-off Angel, which focused on Angel's adventures in Los Angeles. Benz said in an interview: I was shocked, really. When they sent me the script [...] I kept asking, 'Where's Darla?' I remember <b>calling</b> <b>my</b> agent asking, 'Are you sure they want me for this episode because I can't seem to find me?' And then I get to the last page and there I am... naked in a box. Awesome. It was exciting.|$|E
500|$|Ian Champeau, an Ojibway man in Ottawa, Ontario, filed a {{human rights}} {{complaint}} against the Nepean Redskins Football Club {{on behalf of his}} five-year-old daughter {{in an effort to get}} the team to change its name. [...] "How are they going to differentiate the playing field from the school yard? What's going to stop them from <b>calling</b> <b>my</b> daughter a redskin in the school yard? That's as offensive as using the n-word." [...] Assembly of First Nations National Chief Shawn Atleo said he supports the move because the word Redskin is [...] "offensive and hurtful and completely inappropriate. The team was changed to the [...] "Nepean Eagles", chosen from 70 suggestions submitted. Niigaan Sinclair (Anishinaabe), a writer and assistant professor at the University of Manitoba, applauded the decision and contrasted it to the decision of Daniel Snyder, the Washington team owner.|$|E
2500|$|Bemies is {{best known}} for his role as a pioneer of college basketball. [...] In 1892, after {{witnessing}} an exhibition basketball game arranged by Naismith in Springfield, Bemies formed the first college basketball team at Geneva College. [...] Under Bemies' guidance, Geneva College became the first college in the United States to field a basketball team. [...] Interviewed in 2010, Ian Naismith, a basketball historian and the grandson of the sport's inventor, sought to settle disputing claims as to which college was the first to introduce basketball. [...] Naismith said, [...] "My grandfather considered Geneva to be the birthplace of college basketball, and how can anybody argue with him? If you say anything differently, you're <b>calling</b> <b>my</b> grandfather, my father, and me, liars." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mark Bautz of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album B+, <b>calling</b> <b>My</b> Love Is Your Love [...] "A {{schizophrenic}} album" [...] and [...] "A primer on today's hip-hop/R scene: the good, the bad." [...] {{by reason of}} the unevenness of the album. He commented [...] "Wyclef Jean's gorgeous reggae-tinged title song and three funky cuts by Rodney Jerkins showcase the 35-year-old Whitney Houston in all her creative, soulful maturity. In contrast, a trio of schmaltzy Babyface-produced tunes expose her as merely a gifted interpreter of bland radio-ready fare.". Similarly, TIME praised some new songs, calling the title song [...] "superb" [...] and Houston's remake of Stevie Wonder's classic [...] "fabulous", but criticized the old-fashioned songs of the album sharply, commenting [...] "The problem is with the Old Guard: producer David Foster's work is dull, and Dianne Warren and Babyface, who both wrote tracks, have better work on their respective resumes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2014, Kahn {{recalled}} [...] "Janet Jackson {{has a very}} charming way {{of going}} through her editorial process – she always goes [...] "if you think it works," [...] and she means it. That's awesome, she's freaking Janet Jackson." [...] Jackson contacted Kahn directly to direct the video, saying [...] "I was star struck on Janet for sure, {{because that was the}} first time that I really dealt with someone that was in my youth. I studied Janet Jackson videos growing up. So to finally see myself face to face with her and working with her and her calling me on a first name basis and <b>calling</b> <b>my</b> home and tracking me down on my cell phone… like her leaving messages, it was the weirdest thing." [...] Kahn continued [...] "And Janet, she really is elegant, she’s like royalty. Even though she’s talking to you and trying to be normal, she’s not – she’s Janet Jackson – and you can never get that out of your head. You realize that she’s a real person and she’s got just the same emotions as everyone else, but you can never get around the fact that she’s special." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following his Australian {{citizenship}} ceremony, Coetzee {{said that}} [...] "I did {{not so much}} leave South Africa, a country with which I retain strong emotional ties, but come to Australia. I came because {{from the time of}} my first visit in 1991, I was attracted by the free and generous spirit of the people, by the beauty of the land itself and– when I first saw Adelaide– by the grace of the city that I now have the honour of <b>calling</b> <b>my</b> home." [...] When he initially moved to Australia, he had cited the South African government's lax attitude to crime in that country as a reason for the move, leading to a spat with Thabo Mbeki, who, speaking of Coetzee's novel Disgrace stated that [...] "South Africa is not only a place of rape". In 1999, the African National Congress submission to an investigation into racism in the media by the South African Human Rights Commission named Disgrace as a novel exploiting racist stereotypes. However, when Coetzee won his Nobel Prize, Mbeki congratulated him [...] "on behalf of the South African nation and indeed the continent of Africa".|$|E
