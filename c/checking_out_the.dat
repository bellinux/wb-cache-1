5|$|Following the crew's post-sleep activities, {{they went}} to work {{performing}} the rendezvous operations that included burning the orbiter's engines to refine the approach to the Hubble telescope. Following some delays due to communications issues, Altman and Johnson ("Ray-J") guided the orbiter within fifty feet of the telescope. McArthur successfully grappled Hubble at 17:14 UTC, and at 18:12 the telescope was safely berthed in the payload bay of Atlantis. Later in the day, Grunsfeld and Feustel (Drew), along with Good ("Bueno") and Massimino ("Mass") worked on preparing for the next day's spacewalk, gathering tools and <b>checking</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> suits and equipment {{that would be used}} during the EVA.|$|E

25|$|The seven person crew of STS-131 {{was awakened}} {{to begin their}} first full day in space on Flight Day 2. Due {{to the lack of}} Ku-band communication, changes to the crews daily plan were read up for them to write out. After their post sleep activities, {{commander}} Alan Poindexter and pilot Jim Dutton fired Discoverys Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines to correct and further refine the shuttle's path to the ISS. Astronauts Naoko Yamazaki and Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger began activating and <b>checking</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) also known as the Canadarm. While Metcalf-Lindenburger and Yamazaki were working with Canadarm, Stephanie Wilson was getting equipment together and set up to record the inspections of the shuttle's heat shield. The inspections were recorded so they could be downlinked to the ground once docked to the ISS. Once all that work was done, commander Poindexter and pilot Dutton joined Metcalf-Lindenburger, Yamazaki, and Wilson to conduct the inspection of the shuttle's heat shield. While the inspection was going on, Rick Mastracchio and Clayton Anderson were on the mid-deck of Discovery <b>checking</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) and getting them ready for their three spacewalks. The last portion of the crew day was spent preparing and checking out all of the tools used during rendezvous.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{takes place}} within the final scene of [...] "Last of the Time Lords". After the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) parts ways with Martha (Freema Agyeman), he tries taking off, only for the TARDIS to spin wildly and sound an alarm. <b>Checking</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> systems, the Doctor passes his fifth {{incarnation}} (Peter Davison) doing the same thing. The Tenth Doctor recognises his past self and is overjoyed to see him, gently poking fun at his particular eccentricities, such as the stick of celery on his lapel and the unneeded glasses he sometimes wears; he also explains that his presence has 'shorten out the time differential' between himself and his past incarnation, resulting in the latter gaining an uncharacteristic older physical appearance. [...] The Fifth Doctor is annoyed, believing his counterpart to be a fan who has broken into the TARDIS.|$|E
500|$|For Rise Against, Appeal to Reason {{marked a}} musical {{shift from the}} gritty punk rock that had {{previously}} defined their career, to a more accessible and radio-friendly sound, with greater emphasis on production value. The New York Times felt the album was more tune-oriented than the band's previous works, while John Hanson of Sputnikmusic said that the album is [...] "'appealing' to a larger audience than old fans will be comfortable with". According to Bill Stewart of PopMatters, [...] "Appeal to Reason is a Rise Against album. If you possess {{more than a passing}} familiarity with the band, I wouldn't even bother scrolling through the rest of this review, and I'd certainly avoid <b>checking</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> rating at the end of it—because that first sentence, for better or worse, says everything that needs to be said about this album." [...] Critics have characterized the album's music as melodic hardcore and punk rock, with influences of pop punk.|$|E
