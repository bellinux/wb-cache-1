5|$|Kidneys: renal tubular {{acidosis}} (Type 2), {{a disorder}} of bicarbonate handling by the proximal tubules leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), a weakening of bones (due to <b>calcium</b> <b>and</b> phosphate loss), and occasionally aminoaciduria (loss of essential amino acids needed for protein synthesis).|$|E
5|$|Nobelium's {{complexing}} ability with chloride ions is most {{similar to}} that of barium, which complexes rather weakly. Its complexing ability with citrate, oxalate, and acetate in an aqueous solution of 0.5Mammonium nitrate is between that of <b>calcium</b> <b>and</b> strontium, although it is somewhat closer to that of strontium.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid hormone (PTH, {{known as}} parathormone) {{is a small}} protein that takes part in the control of <b>calcium</b> <b>and</b> {{phosphate}} homeostasis, as well as bone physiology. Parathyroid hormone has effects antagonistic to those of calcitonin.|$|E

5|$|Strontium is a {{divalent}} silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose properties are mostly intermediate between and {{similar to those}} of its group neighbors <b>calcium</b> <b>and</b> barium. It is softer than <b>calcium</b> <b>and</b> harder than barium. Its melting (777°C) and boiling (1655°C) points are lower than those of calcium (842°C and 1757°C respectively); barium continues this downward trend in the melting point (727°C), but not in the boiling point (2170°C). The density of strontium (2.64g/cm3) is similarly intermediate between those of calcium (1.54g/cm3) and barium (3.594g/cm3). Three allotropes of metallic strontium exist, with transition points at 235 and 540°C.|$|E
5|$|The major {{function}} of the parathyroid glands is to maintain the body's <b>calcium</b> <b>and</b> phosphate levels within a very narrow range, so that the nervous and muscular systems can function properly. The parathyroid glands do this by secreting parathyroid hormone.|$|E
50|$|As with adults, most {{pediatric}} {{kidney stones}} are predominantly composed of <b>calcium</b> oxalate; struvite <b>and</b> <b>calcium</b> phosphate stones are less common.

50|$|Bleaching powder is {{made with}} {{slightly}} moist slaked lime. It {{is not a simple}} mixture of calcium hypochlorite, <b>calcium</b> chloride, <b>and</b> <b>calcium</b> hydroxide. Instead, it is a mixture consisting principally of calcium hypochlorite Ca(OCl)2, dibasic <b>calcium</b> hypochlorite, Ca3(OCl)2(OH)4, <b>and</b> dibasic <b>calcium</b> chloride, Ca3Cl2(OH)4.|$|R
50|$|<b>Calcium</b> {{hydroxyapatite}} <b>and</b> calcite precipitates can {{be found}} around bacteria in alluvial topsoil. As clay minerals promote biomineralization, the presence of bacteria and clay minerals resulted in <b>calcium</b> hydroxyapatite <b>and</b> calcite precipitates.|$|R
5|$|To {{the north}} of Bath are Lansdown, Langridge and Solsbury hills. These are {{outliers}} of the Cotswolds. Bath is noted for its thermal waters (48°C) that are rich in <b>calcium</b> <b>and</b> sodium sulphates.|$|E
5|$|A United States Geological Survey {{report in}} the 1960s {{measured}} the concentration of bicarbonate in Mud Creek to range from 41 to 109 milligrams per liter, {{but there were no}} carbonates in the water. The creek's nitrate concentration ranged from 3.3 to 6.3 milligrams per liter for filtered water and the concentration of sulfates ranged from 23 to 29 milligrams per liter, again for filtered water. The concentration of chlorides in the creek's filtered waters ranged from 7 to 23 milligrams per liter. The <b>calcium</b> <b>and</b> magnesium concentrations in filtered water were 20 to 44 and 4.4 to 6 milligrams per liter, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Close to {{the village}} and gorge are Batts Combe quarry and Callow Rock quarry, two of the active Quarries of the Mendip Hills where {{limestone}} is still extracted. Operating since the early 20thcentury, Batts Combe is {{owned and operated by}} Hanson Aggregates. The output in 2005 was around 4,000 tonnes of limestone per day, one third of which was supplied to an on-site lime kiln, which closed in 2009; the remainder was sold as coated or dusted aggregates. The limestone at this site is close to 99percent carbonate of <b>calcium</b> <b>and</b> magnesium (dolomite).|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the heavy s-block elements, {{including}} strontium, a vast range of coordination numbers is known, from 2, 3, or 4 {{all the way to}} 22 or 24 in SrCd11 and SrZn13. The Ca2+ ion is quite large, so that high coordination numbers are the rule. The large size of strontium and barium plays a significant part in stabilising strontium complexes with polydentate macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers: for example, while 18-crown-6 forms relatively weak complexes with <b>calcium</b> <b>and</b> the alkali metals, its strontium and barium complexes are much stronger.|$|E
5|$|For atoms {{with low}} atomic numbers, a nucleus {{that has more}} {{neutrons}} than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutron–proton ratio is closer to one. However, as the atomic number increases, {{a higher proportion of}} neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 (<b>calcium)</b> <b>and</b> as Z increases, the neutron–proton ratio of stable isotopes increases. The stable isotope with the highest proton–neutron ratio is lead-208 (about 1.5).|$|E
5|$|Hydrofluoric acid is {{a contact}} poison with greater hazards than many strong acids like sulfuric acid {{even though it}} is weak: it remains neutral in aqueous {{solution}} and thus penetrates tissue faster, whether through inhalation, ingestion or the skin, and at least nine U.S. workers died in such accidents from 1984 to 1994. It reacts with <b>calcium</b> <b>and</b> magnesium in the blood leading to hypocalcemia and possible death through cardiac arrhythmia. Insoluble calcium fluoride formation triggers strong pain and burns larger than 160cm2 (25in2) can cause serious systemic toxicity.|$|E
30|$|Early-strength agents with {{carboxyl}} groups {{can improve the}} compressive strength of concrete by promoting the hydration of cement. Materials that have {{carboxyl groups}} {{and can be used}} as early-strength agents include <b>calcium</b> acetate <b>and</b> <b>calcium</b> formate. <b>Calcium</b> acetate <b>and</b> <b>calcium</b> formate can improve the strength of cement by promoting hydration of the gypsum component and C 3 A therein (Min et al. 2014; Le Saoût et al. 2013; Huang and Shen 2014). These early-strength agents are known to possess anti-corrosive properties (Monticelli et al. 2000).|$|R

5|$|Legumes such as clover or alfalfa {{are usually}} higher in protein, <b>calcium,</b> <b>and</b> energy than grasses. However, they require warm weather and good soil {{to produce the}} best nutrients. Legume hays are {{generally}} higher in protein than the grass hays. They are also higher in minerals, particularly calcium, but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they are high in protein, they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|Potassium is {{the eighth}} or ninth most common element by mass (0.2%) {{in the human}} body, so that a 60kg adult {{contains}} {{a total of about}} 120g of potassium. The body has about as much potassium as sulfur and chlorine, and only <b>calcium</b> <b>and</b> phosphorus are more abundant (with the exception of the ubiquitous CHON elements). Potassium ions are present {{in a wide variety of}} proteins and enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Relatively strong {{reducing}} acids {{can have}} antinutrient effects by binding to dietary minerals such as iron and zinc in the gastrointestinal tract and {{preventing them from}} being absorbed. Notable examples are oxalic acid, tannins and phytic acid, which are high in plant-based diets. <b>Calcium</b> <b>and</b> iron deficiencies are not uncommon in diets in developing countries where less meat is eaten and there is high consumption of phytic acid from beans and unleavened whole grain bread.|$|E
50|$|He {{established}} that cyclic ADP-ribose regulates calcium-induced <b>calcium</b> release <b>and</b> globalization of <b>calcium</b> signals, <b>and</b> that Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a ubiquitous trigger for initiating <b>and</b> coordinating <b>calcium</b> signals, often involving communication between organelles at contact sites.|$|R
5000|$|Roasting pollucite with <b>calcium</b> {{carbonate}} <b>and</b> <b>calcium</b> chloride yields insoluble <b>calcium</b> silicates <b>and</b> soluble caesium chloride.
