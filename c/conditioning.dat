40|$|The Building Department of the School of Architecture of the University of Navarra is {{developing}} {{for some time}} a research line related {{to the development of}} constructive systems of innovative façades. One of the developed tools in this research line refers to those factors that could determine or influence the final constructive solution. It is also important {{to take into account the}} whole life cycle of the new system, its relation to other constructive systems of the building and its influence in the global building process. A thorough relation of the diverse types of <b>conditionings,</b> which should be considered in the design of façades, has been developed as a guide to identify those that explicitly or implicitly will be necessary to take into account in each case study. Several families of <b>conditionings</b> have been categorized. This complete relation of <b>conditionings</b> allows identifying and defining the main objectives to be considered in each case. These objectives help to define the specific demands (exigencies) that should be solved by the façade constructive system. In this communication we intend to show the importance of these <b>conditionings</b> as a way to study and design these new façades. These <b>conditionings</b> serve as a starting point for the elaboration of a specific programme of necessities related to façade systems. The detailed study of the <b>conditionings</b> allows advancing in the study, analysis, design or assessment of the new constructive systems of façades we expect to develop by means of conceptual and experimental research...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBy using {{appropriate}} meditation {{techniques in}} order to obtain altered states of consciousness, one can transfer, diminish or annihilate <b>conditionings</b> from the implicit subcortical memory. When the attention is constantly and systematically focused on the physical body, at the skin level appear sensations as sensorial perceptions of the somatic manifestations of the subliminal records of the <b>conditionings</b> from the implicit memory. Under these circumstances occurs a selective de-potentiation of the unconscious personal concepts, stopping the occurrence of the uncomfortable symptoms, the integration of the new obtained psycho-emotional reality of the balanced ways to relate with you and the outside world...|$|R

5|$|Evaluative <b>conditioning</b> {{suggests}} that if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative <b>conditioning</b> as a variation of classical <b>conditioning</b> in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative <b>conditioning.</b> Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative <b>conditioning</b> is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} local {{convergence}} of critical Galton-Watson trees and Levy trees under various <b>conditionings.</b> Assuming a very general monotonicity property on the functional of random trees, {{we show that}} random trees conditioned to have large functional values always converge locally to immortal trees. We also derive a very general ratio limit property for functionals of random trees satisfying the monotonicity property. Then {{we move on to}} study the local convergence of critical continuous-state branching processes, and prove a similar result. Finally we give a definition of continuum condensation trees, which should be the correct local limits for certain subcritical Levy trees under suitable <b>conditionings.</b> Comment: 22 page...|$|R
