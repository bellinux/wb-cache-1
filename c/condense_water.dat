25|$|In {{commerce}} and manufacturing, {{there are many}} uses for refrigeration. Refrigeration is used to liquify gases - oxygen, nitrogen, propane and methane, for example. In compressed air purification, {{it is used to}} <b>condense</b> <b>water</b> vapor from compressed air to reduce its moisture content. In oil refineries, chemical plants, and petrochemical plants, refrigeration is used to maintain certain processes at their needed low temperatures (for example, in alkylation of butenes and butane to produce a high octane gasoline component). Metal workers use refrigeration to temper steel and cutlery. When transporting temperature-sensitive foodstuffs and other materials by trucks, trains, airplanes and seagoing vessels, refrigeration is a necessity.|$|E

[...] Siloxanes in the gas will form deposits in gas burners {{and need to be}} removed prior to entry into any gas distribution or transmission system. Consequently, it may be more economical to burn the gas on site or within a short distance of the landfill using a dedicated pipeline. Water vapor is often removed, even if the gas is burned on site. [...] If low temperatures <b>condense</b> <b>water</b> out of the gas, siloxanes can be lowered as well because they tend to condense out with the water vapor. Other non-methane components may also be removed to meet emission standards, to prevent fouling of the equipment or for environmental considerations. Co-firing landfill gas with natural gas improves combustion, which lowers emissions.|$|E

2500|$|As meteoroids are heated during {{atmospheric}} entry, their surfaces melt {{and experience}} ablation. They can be sculpted into various shapes during this process, sometimes resulting in shallow thumbprint-like indentations on their surfaces called s. If the meteoroid maintains a fixed orientation for some time, without tumbling, it may develop a conical [...] "nose cone" [...] or [...] "heat shield" [...] shape. As it decelerates, eventually the molten surface layer solidifies into a thin fusion crust, which on most meteorites is black (on some achondrites, the fusion crust {{may be very}} light colored). On stony meteorites, the heat-affected zone is at most a few mm deep; in iron meteorites, which are more thermally conductive, {{the structure of the}} metal may be affected by heat up to [...] below the surface.

50|$|Relevant {{to global}} climate, DMS {{is thought to}} play a role in the Earth's heat budget by {{decreasing}} the amount of solar radiation that reaches the Earth's surface.

Thermodynamic-behaviour chiller and cooling tower models {{were developed to}} assess how different control methods of cooling towers and <b>condenser</b> <b>water</b> pumps influence the trade-off between the chiller power, pump power, fan power and water consumption under various operating conditions. Load-based speed control is introduced for the tower fans and <b>condenser</b> <b>water</b> pumps to achieve optimum system performance. With regard to an example chiller system serving an office building, the optimal control coupled with variable <b>condenser</b> <b>water</b> flow could reduce the annual system electricity use by 5. 3 % and operating cost by 4. 9 % relative to the equivalent system using constant speed fans and pumps with a fixed set point for cooling water temperature control.

50|$|Cooling {{towers and}} pumps {{are used to}} supply cool <b>condenser</b> <b>water</b> to the {{chillers}}. Because the <b>condenser</b> <b>water</b> supply to the chillers has to be constant, variable speed drives are commonly used on the cooling tower fans to control temperature. Proper cooling tower temperature assures the proper refrigerant head pressure in the chiller. The cooling tower set point used depends upon the refrigerant being used. Analog temperature sensors measure the <b>condenser</b> <b>water</b> supply and return lines.|$|R

The design is simpler {{and has the}} benefit of being quieter compared to a dehumidifier with a mechanical compressor. However, because of its relatively poor Coefficient of Performance, this design is mainly used for small dehumidifiers. Ice buildup may be a problem, similar to problems with refrigeration dehumidifiers.|$|E

50|$|The claws on the hind {{feet are}} {{elongated}} and curved backward to enable cleaning and grooming between the spines. Like the platypus, the echidna {{has a low}} body temperature—between 30 and 32 °C (86 and 90 °F)—but, unlike the platypus, which shows no evidence of torpor or hibernation, the body temperature of the echidna may fall as low as 5 °C (41 °F). The echidna does not pant or sweat and normally seeks shelter in hot conditions. Despite their inability to sweat, echidnas still lose water as they exhale. The snout {{is believed to be}} crucial in restricting this loss to sustainable levels, through a bony labyrinth that has a refrigerator effect and helps to <b>condense</b> <b>water</b> vapour in the breath. The echidna does not have highly concentrated urine, and around half of the estimated daily water loss of 120 g occurs in this manner, while most of the rest is through the skin and respiratory system. Most of this is replenished by its substantial eating of termites—one laboratory study reported ingestion of around 147 g a day, most of which was water. This can be supplemented by drinking water, if available, or licking morning dew from flora.|$|E

50|$|In {{technical}} terms, the {{dew point}} is the temperature at which the water vapor {{in a sample of}} air at constant barometric pressure <b>condenses</b> into liquid <b>water</b> at the same rate at which it evaporates.

The <b>condensed</b> <b>water</b> is called either fog or a cloud, depending on its altitude, when it forms in the air.|$|R

50|$|Charles Thomson Rees Wilson (1869-1959), a Scottish physicist, is {{credited}} with inventing the cloud chamber. Inspired by sightings of the Brocken spectre while working on the summit of Ben Nevis in 1894, he began to develop expansion chambers for studying cloud formation and optical phenomena in moist air. Very rapidly he discovered that ions could act as centers for water droplet formation in such chambers. He pursued the application of this discovery and perfected the first cloud chamber in 1911. In Wilson's original chamber the air inside the sealed device was saturated with water vapor, then a diaphragm was used to expand the air inside the chamber (adiabatic expansion), cooling the air and starting to <b>condense</b> <b>water</b> vapor. Hence the name expansion cloud chamber is used. When an ionizing particle passes through the chamber, water vapor condenses on the resulting ions and {{the trail of the}} particle is visible in the vapor cloud. Wilson, along with Arthur Compton, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927 for his work on the cloud chamber. This kind of chamber is also called a Pulsed Chamber because the conditions for operation are not continuously maintained. Further developments were made by Patrick Blackett who utilised a stiff spring to expand and compress the chamber very rapidly, making the chamber sensitive to particles several times a second. A cine film was used to record the images.|$|E

At the design load, the max film located in the pool at the end of condensation is 1. 1 mm, and with the inclined angle varying from 5 to 85 °, the max film varied from 0. 8 mm to 2. 1 mm, which means that changing inclined angle is puny to raise anti-freezing capability...|$|E
