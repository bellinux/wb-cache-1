50|$|The <b>crocodile</b> <b>icefish</b> or white-blooded fish (Channichthyidae) {{comprise}} {{a family of}} notothenioid fish found in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica and southern South America, where water temperatures remain relatively stable (generally ranging from -1.8 to +2.0 °C). Sixteen species of <b>crocodile</b> <b>icefish</b> are currently recognized.|$|R

50|$|Pagetopsis is a genus of <b>crocodile</b> <b>icefishes</b> {{found in}} the Southern Ocean.|$|E
50|$|Antarctic fish is {{a common}} name {{for a variety of}} fish that inhabit the Southern Ocean. They {{originate}} from the five different families that belong to the suborder Notothenioidei of the order Perciformes. They are from families Artedidraconidae (barbeled plunderfishes), Bathydraconidae (Antarctic dragonfishes), Channichthyidae (<b>crocodile</b> <b>icefishes</b> or white-blooded fishes), Harpagiferidae (spiny plunderfish), and Nototheniidae (cod icefishes). They are also called notothenioids, but this name is also used to describe the other three, non-Antarctic families and some of the non-Antarctic genera in the mainly Antarctic families belonging to the suborder.|$|E
50|$|Neopagetopsis ionah, Jonah's icefish, is {{a species}} of <b>crocodile</b> <b>icefish</b> found in the Southern Ocean at depths of from 20 to 900 m. This species grows to a length of 56 cm TL. This species is the only known member of its genus.|$|R
50|$|Chaenodraco wilsoni, the Spiny Icefish, is {{a species}} of <b>crocodile</b> <b>icefish</b> native to the Southern Ocean where it occurs at depths of from 200 to 800 m. This species grows to a length of 43 cm TL. It is of minor {{importance}} to commercial fisheries. This species is the only known member of its genus.|$|R
50|$|Chaenocephalus aceratus, the {{blackfin}} icefish, is {{a species}} of <b>crocodile</b> <b>icefish</b> known from around Bouvet Island and the northern Antarctic Peninsula where it occurs at depths of 5 to 770 m. This species grows to a length of 72 cm TL. It is of minor importance to commercial fisheries. This species is the only known member of its genus.|$|R
50|$|Pseudochaenichthys georgianus, the South Georgia icefish, is {{a species}} of <b>crocodile</b> <b>icefish</b> only known from the {{northern}} Antarctic Peninsula and the Scotia Sea where it occurs from the surface to 475 m. This species grows to a length of 60 cm TL. It is of minor importance to commercial fisheries. This species is the only known member of its genus.|$|R
25|$|Almost all vertebrates, {{including}} all mammals and humans, have red blood cells. Red blood cells are cells present in blood {{in order to}} transport oxygen. The only known vertebrates without red blood cells are the <b>crocodile</b> <b>icefish</b> (family Channichthyidae); they live in very oxygen-rich cold water and transport oxygen freely dissolved in their blood. While they no longer use hemoglobin, remnants of hemoglobin genes {{can be found in}} their genome.|$|R
50|$|Channichthyids' most {{well known}} feature is {{their lack of}} erythrocytes. Genetic {{evidence}} shows that <b>crocodile</b> <b>icefish</b> had erythrocytes but have back evolved to not use hemoglobin, or any protein binding for oxygen transport. Instead, white-blooded fish have improved heart output, higher blood volume, higher uptake of oxygen and lower metabolic rates. The discovery that icefish species Neopagetopsis ionah possesses a nearly intact, but useless set of globin genes demonstrates that multiple events led {{to the loss of}} hemoglobin expression in icefish.|$|R
50|$|Eggs are {{released}} in batches. Notothenioids {{are known for}} nesting and guarding their eggs to ensure protection from predators, improve oxygen content of water around eggs and dispose of dead or damaged eggs. Whether or not these eggs are pelagic or attached to the seafloor, rocks or sponges depends on the species of fish. <b>Crocodile</b> <b>icefish</b> tend to have either eggs attached to the seafloor and with eggs attached to the pelvic fin. Bathydraconids guard eggs on the seafloor of shallow waters. Both harpagiferids and artedidraconids also guard their eggs by attaching them to the seafloor.|$|R
50|$|Antarctic minke whales feed almost {{exclusively}} on euphausiids. In the Southern Ocean, over 90% of individuals fed on Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba); E. crystallorophias also formed {{an important part of}} the diet in some areas, particularly in the relatively shallow waters of Prydz Bay. Rare and incidental items include calanoid copepods, the pelagic amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii, Antarctic sidestripes (Pleuragramma antarcticum), the <b>crocodile</b> <b>icefish</b> Cryodraco antarcticus, nototheniids, and myctophids. The majority of individuals examined off South Africa had empty stomachs. The few that did have food in their stomachs had all preyed on euphausiids, mainly Thysanoessa gregaria and E. recurva.|$|R
40|$|Dispersal via pelagic larval stages plays a {{key role}} in {{population}} connectivity of many marine species. The degree of connectivity is often correlated with the time that larvae spend in the water column. The Antarctic notothenioid fishes develop through an unusually long pelagic larval phase often exceeding 1  year. Notothenioids thus represent a prime model system for studying the influence of prolonged larval phases on population structure in otherwise demersal species. Here, we compare the population genetic structure and demographic history of two sub-Antarctic <b>crocodile</b> <b>icefish</b> species (Chaenocephalus aceratus and Champsocephalus gunnari) from the Scotia Arc and Bouvet Island in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean to delineate the relative importance of species-specific, oceanographic and paleoclimatic factors to gene flow. Based on 7 (C.  aceratus) and 8 (C.  gunnari) microsatellites, as well as two mitochondrial DNA markers (cytochrome b, D-loop), we detect pronounced population genetic structure in both species (amova FSTs range from 0. 04 to 0. 53). High genetic similarities were found concordantly in the populations sampled at the Southern Scotia Arc between Elephant Island and South Orkney Islands, whereas the populations from Bouvet Island, which is located far to the east of the Scotia Arc, are substantially differentiated from those of the Scotia Arc region. Nonetheless, haplotype genealogies and Bayesian cluster analyses suggest occasional gene flow over thousands of kilometres. Higher divergences between populations of C.  gunnari as compared to C.  aceratus are probably caused by lower dispersal capabilities and demographic effects. Bayesian skyline plots reveal population size reductions during past glacial events in both species with an estimated onset of population expansions about 25   000  years ago...|$|R
