40|$|The {{aluminium}} content in dewatered aluminium-coagulated water treatment residual (DAC-WTR) {{can lead to}} a high phosphorus (P) removal capacity. Therefore, DAC-WTR has been used as adsorbent/soil amendment to remove P in several studies, focusing mostly on orthophosphates (ortho-P). This study is concerned with extending such reuse of DAC-WTR to remove P using a <b>condensed</b> <b>phosphate</b> as the model P source. Using a 48 -hr equilibration time and a 1. 18 mm (mean particle size); (1) P removal was found to increase with increasing DAC-WTR dosage, but specific uptake of P per mass of DAC-WTR was decreased (2) A maximum adsorption capacity of 4. 52 mg-P/g of DAC-WTR was obtained at a pH of 4. 0. In the continuous flow test, P removal efficiency decreased from 90 to 30 % when loading was increased from 3. 9 to 16. 5 g-P/m 2. d. An average 45 % removal efficiency was obtained after an intentional P loading surge. At the end of the continuous flow test, an operating removal capacity of 2. 66 mg-P/g of DAC-WTR was determined which was 83. 3 % of the adsorption maxima obtained in the batch tests. There was no excessive loss of solids during the continuous flow test and {{aluminium content}} in the effluent remained below 0. 1 mg-Al 3 +/l.

40|$|A {{simple and}} mild on-line photo-oxidative {{decomposition}} method for the highly sensitive flow-injection spectrophotometric determination of total phosphorus in river and waste waters {{was developed for}} the first time by using low pressure mercury lamps. Organic and inorganic phosphorus compounds in sample solutions were injected into a carrier solution, which merged with the decomposition solution containing sulfuric acid and potassium peroxodisulfate. The solution components were decomposed oxidatively to orthophosphate while flowing in a photo-reactor. After the decomposition, orthophosphate was determined spectrophotometrically based on the formation of Molybdenum Blue. The photo-reactor consisted of two low pressure mercury lamps, a poly(terafluoroethylene) (PTFE) tubing and a reflection mirror. The PTFE tubing was wound directly around the mercury lamps, which were covered with reflection mirror. The detection limit for phosphorus was about 0. 001 mg l(- 1), and the sample throuphput was about 20 samples per hour for total phosphorus determination. By using the photo-reactor, most of the phosphorus compounds were decomposed completely, whereas some <b>condensed</b> <b>phosphates</b> were less susceptible to photo-oxidation.

40|$|Phosphorus is a {{key element}} in biology, serving in {{cellular}} replication, metabolism, and structure. The versatility of phosphorus in biology is due to several unique chemical characteristics that rely on its electronic structure and geochemical abundance. The formation of phosphorylated biomolecules and their activated precursors have hence been a major focus of prebiotic syntheses for the past 50 years. This chapter highlights the basic chemical and physical features that make phosphorus chemicals so valuable within contemporary biochemistry, the putative prebiotic routes to phosphorylated biomolecules, and a growing role for reduced oxidation state phosphorus compounds, including those derived from meteorites, in the development of life on the Earth. We distinguish three primary forms of biological phosphates that form an energetic hierarchy: (i) stable phosphorylated biomolecules that are unreactive and in which the P provides a structural or binding handle; (ii) energetic <b>condensed</b> <b>phosphates</b> including ATP which store metabolic energy; and (iii) reactive phosphorylated biomolecules which are generated during metabolism and transfer phosphates and energy to <b>condensed</b> <b>phosphates</b> for energy storage.

A second polymorph β-NH_ 4 MnP_ 2 O_ 7 was also identified, with both found to be key components of a commerical manganese violet pigment. The α-NH_ 4 Mn_xFe_ 1 _-_xP_ 2 O_ 7 solid solution was also characterised, with the introduction of Fe_ 3 _+ resulting in a distinct colour change, an improvement in thermal stability and a change in the magnetic properties of these materials. Similar changes were seen in the RbMn_xFe_ 1 _-_xP_ 2 O_ 7 system but a marked improvement in thermal stability, with an unusual decomposition mechanism involving manganese expulsion observed for the intermediate members. Analogous studies were performed on compounds of composition RbMn_xFe_ 1 _-_xHP_ 3 O_ 1 _ 0, Mn_xFe_ 1 _-_xH_ 2 P_ 3 O_ 1 _ 0 (x ≤ 0. 5), Mn_xFe_ 1 _-_xP_ 3 O 9 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0. 4 and 0. 75 ≤ x ≤ 1) and β-HMnP_ 2 O_ 7.

Both structures consist of frameworks of corner-sharing MnO 6 octahedra linked together by <b>condensed</b> <b>phosphate</b> anions, with Rb+ cations located in the intersecting channels.

40|$|<b>Condensed</b> <b>phosphates</b> {{were first}} used in cooling water {{applications}} in the early 190302 ̆ 7 s. Extensive use was found for these polyphosphates because {{of their ability to}} control calcium carbonate scaling at threshold or substoichiometric dosages. Later, their ability to control the corrosion of steel in open recirculating cooling water systems and once through cooling water systems demonstrated the versatility of this class of compounds. ^ The use of polyphosphates began to give way to the acid chromate programs as the primary corrosion inhibitor for mild steel in open recirculating systems in the early 19602 ̆ 7 s. This preference for chromate and chromate-zinc programs was still quite prevalent in the early 19702 ̆ 7 s. The cause for this change stems from the one major disadvantage of polyphosphate treatments -hydrolytic instability which produces orthophosphate. The orthophosphate anion forms insoluble scales with all bivalent cations, the most important of which are calcium, magnesium and iron. These scales can foul heat transfer surfaces and reduce dramatically heat transfer efficiency of process heat exchangers. In addition to providing fouling problems, the orthophosphate anion fails to provide the positive effects of <b>condensed</b> <b>phosphates.</b> Orthophosphate does not show a threshold effect and is not as effective in corrosion prevention of steel as <b>condensed</b> <b>phosphates.</b> ^ The Clean Water Act of 1972 began a level of environmental awareness that was not seen before. One of the outcalls of this movement was the identification of hexavalent chromium (chromates) as toxicity to aquatic life because of its low LD 50. Chromates were also identified as potential carcinogens. Efforts to remove the chromate ion from cooling tower blowdown were hampered by the need to label any sludge from the waste treatment facility as hazardous. The need for a non chromate cooling water treatment that could provide the same or better performance as the acid-chromate-zinc treatments became a top priority for industry. ^ This dissertation in the form of US Patent 4, 172, 032 describes the development of such a cooling water treatment. It also describes the discovery of an optimum molecular weight of polyphosphate as the most critical factor in determining the performance of these programs. ^ The synthesis of spire (4, 4) nonanes was done in the period of 1966 to 1970.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of a project funded by the Quebec Ministry of the Environment and Fauna (MEF), {{alternative}} wastewater phosphorus removal methods to alum or ferric chloride coagulation were assessed. The most promising technologies {{were found to be}} enhanced biological phosphorus removal, treatment plant process optimization and on-line process control. The use of alum sludges from potable water treatment plants appeared promising although it has not yet been widely practised or studied. The MEF therefore decided to retain the process as one requiring further study. Through batch sorption tests with synthetic solutions, it was found that aluminum hydroxide has a significant sorptive capacity for orthophosphate, <b>condensed</b> <b>phosphate</b> and organic phosphate. The removal of these phosphates was independent of pH between pH 3 and pH 6. The solubility of the aluminum hydroxide was highly pH-dependent. In all the tests, except that with organic phosphate at pH 3. 6, the measured soluble aluminum was consistent with solutions saturated with solid-phase Al(OH) $ sb 3 $. With organic phosphate at pH 3. 6, an aluminum-organic phosphate appears to have formed. A theoretical analysis of Al(OH) $ sb 3 $ and Al(PO$ sb 4) $ precipitation showed that phosphate removal is not achieved through Al(PO$ sb 4) $ precipitation when dosing with conventional alum, but rather that a mixed aluminum hydroxide phosphate precipitate is formed. Jar tests performed with full-scale alum sludge and wastewater showed that phosphate is removed by the particulate fraction of the sludge. The removal of reactive phosphate (orthophosphate) decreased with an increase in the storage time of the alum sludge. This decrease was not seen with the non-reactive phosphate. It was therefore suggested that reactive phosphate removal is carried out by adsorption and that non-reactive phosphate removal is performed by a sweep-floc mechanism.

The commercialization of Li-ion batteries in the early 1990 ’s revolutionized the portable electronics market, but further improvements are necessary for applications in electric vehicles and load levelling of the electric grid. In this thesis, three new iron based electrode materials for positive electrodes in Li-ion batteries were investigated. Utilizing the redox activity of iron is beneficial over other transition metals due to its abundance in the Earth’s crust. The <b>condensed</b> <b>phosphate</b> Li 2 FeP 2 O 7 together with two different LiFeSO 4 F crystal structures that were studied herein each have their own advantageous, challenges, and scientific questions, and the combined insights gained from the different materials expand the current understanding of Li-ion battery electrodes. The surface reaction kinetics of all three compounds was evaluated by coating them with a conductive polymer layer consisting of poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene), PEDOT. Both LiFeSO 4 F polymorphs showed reduced polarization and increased charge storage capacity upon PEDOT coating, showing the importance of controlling the surface kinetics for this class of compounds. In contrast, the electrochemical performance of PEDOT coated Li 2 FeP 2 O 7 was at best unchanged. The differences highlight that different rate limiting steps prevail for different Li-ion insertion materials. In addition to the electrochemical properties of the new iron based energy storage materials, also their underlying material properties were investigated. For tavorite LiFeSO 4 F, different reaction pathways were identified by in operando XRD evaluation during charge and discharge.

Similar results were obtained with whole L. major promastigotes. 31 P NMR spectra of living L. major promastigotes recorded under conventional solution NMR conditions had spectral intensities reduced with respect to solution-state NMR spectra of acid extracts, consistent with the invisibility of the solid-state phosphates. These results show that all three parasites contain large stores of <b>condensed</b> <b>phosphates</b> which can be visualized by using magic-angle spinning NMR techniques...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorus {{is a key}} {{biologic}} element, and a prebiotic pathway {{leading to}} its incorporation into biomolecules {{has been difficult to}} ascertain. Most potentially prebiotic phosphorylation reactions have relied on orthophosphate as the source of phosphorus. It is suggested here that the geochemistry of phosphorus on the early Earth was instead controlled by reduced oxidation state phosphorus compounds such as phosphite (HPO 3 2 −), which are more soluble and reactive than orthophosphates. This reduced oxidation state phosphorus originated from extraterrestrial material that fell during the heavy bombardment period or was produced during impacts, and persisted in the mildly reducing atmosphere. This alternate view of early Earth phosphorus geochemistry provides an unexplored route to the formation of pertinent prebiotic phosphorus compounds, suggests a facile reaction pathway to <b>condensed</b> <b>phosphates,</b> and is consistent with the biochemical usage of reduced oxidation state phosphorus compounds in life today. Possible studies are suggested that may detect reduced oxidation state phosphorus compounds in ancient Archean rocks...|$|E
40|$|Current {{regulations}} for sensitive receiving waters are approaching {{the limit of}} technology for phosphorus removal and improved methods are required. Existing methods target removal of the orthophosphate form of phosphorus, but to achieve low effluent limits other non-reactive (NRP) forms, such as <b>condensed</b> <b>phosphate</b> and organic phosphorus, must be removed as well. This could be accomplished by developing a quaternary step in wastewater treatment that utilizes reverse osmosis (RO) followed by advanced oxidation processes (AOP) on the produced brine (RO concentrate). The objective during advanced treatment is to convert NRP in the brine to reactive phosphorus for removal by traditional chemical addition methods; however, the various antiscalants utilized for RO membrane maintenance can contribute phosphorus to the brine. To test brine treatment as {{a viable alternative to}} achieve low effluent phosphorus, antiscalant-free brine, demonstration facility-produced brine, four commercially available antiscalants and various representative model phosphorus compounds were evaluated for treatment effectiveness. For antiscalant addition experiments the dosage of antiscalant was designed to match the necessary concentration for effective RO membrane maintenance. The advanced oxidation processes evaluated were 100 ppb peroxide for 30 minutes, 50 ppm bleach for 30 minutes, pH 2 for 30 minutes, and 100 ppb peroxide at pH 2 for 30 minutes. The use of chemical addition as a pretreatment was also evaluated. Treatment effectiveness was determined by measuring residual total phosphorus post AOP treatment after a subsequent 6 ppm alum treatment. The use of 30 ppm alum chemical addition as a pretreatment effectively improves the use of AOPs for P removal from 57 % up to 73 % for a 100 ppb peroxide at pH 2 treated antiscalant free brine. The most effective chemical AOP after a 30 ppm alum pretreatment was 100 ppb peroxide at pH 2 which achieved 73 % TP removal for the antiscalant-free brine, 84 % TP removal in the demonstration facility produced brine, 66 - 82 % TP removal for the brine amended with the three commercially available antiscalants, and 3 - 92 % TP removal for the various phosphorus standards. A comparison removal using a multiphase treatment which employs UV digestion with 3000 ppm peroxide at pH 2 and 80 - 90 °C for 1 hour was also evaluated and achieved 81 - 94 % TP removal in the two brines and four antiscalant-dosed brines, as well as 73 - 84 % TP removal in the various phosphorus standards. The effectiveness of treatments at converting NRP seems to be bond type dependent, such that phosphate-esters, followed by phospho-esters are the most convertible, whereas phosphonate bonds seem to be resilient to conversion. Therefore RO shows potential for quaternary treatment to achieve low phosphorus levels. The RO brine can concentrate nutrients (whether naturally occurring or contributed by antiscalants), which can be removed by chemical addition as well as via AOP processes...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{contents}} of secretory vesicles ("trichocysts") were {{isolated in the}} condensed state from Paramecium cells. It {{is well known that}} the majority portion of trichocysts perform a rapid decondensation process during exocytosis, which is visible in the light microscope. We have analyzed this condensed-+decondensed transition in vitro and determined some relevant parameters. In the <b>condensed</b> state, free <b>phosphate</b> (and possibly magnesium) ions screen local surplus charges. This is supported by x-ray spectra recorded from individual trichocysts (prepared by physical methods) in a scanning transmission electron microscope. Calcium, as well as other ions that eliminate phosphate by precipitation, produces decondensation in vitro. Under in vivo conditions, Ca t+ enters the vesicle lumen from the outside medium, once an exocytic opening has been formed. Consequently, within the intact cell, membrane fusion and protein decondensation take place with optimal timing. Ca 21 might then trigger decondensation in the same way by precipitating phosphate ions (as it does in vitro) and, indeed, such precipitates (again yielding Ca and P signals in x-ray spectra) can be recognized in situ under trigger conditions. As decondensation is a unidirectional, rapid process in Paramecium cells, it would contribute to drive the discharge of the secretory contents to the outside. Furthe...|$|R
