5|$|Aboard the {{airliner}} FBI agents recovered 66 unidentified latent fingerprints, Cooper's black <b>clip-on</b> tie and mother-of-pearl tie clip, {{and two of}} {{the four}} parachutes, one of which had been opened and two shroud lines cut from its canopy. Eyewitnesses in Portland, Seattle, and Reno, and all those who personally interacted with Cooper were interviewed. A series of composite sketches was developed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clip-on</b> {{earrings}} – <b>Clip-on</b> earrings {{have existed}} {{longer than any}} other variety of non-pierced earrings. The clip itself is a two-part piece attached {{to the back of}} an earring. The two pieces closed around the earlobe, using mechanical pressure to hold the earring in place.|$|E
25|$|The <b>clip-on</b> tie is a bow tie or four-in-hand tie {{which is}} {{permanently}} tied, with a dimple {{just below the}} knot, and which is fixed {{to the front of}} the shirt collar by a metal clip. Alternately, the tie may have a band around the neck fastened with a hook and eye. The <b>clip-on</b> tie was reportedly invented on December 13, 1928 in Clinton, Iowa, USA. The name of the inventor remains unknown.|$|E
50|$|The <b>clip-ons</b> {{have been}} plagued by {{significant}} issues. In 1987, cracks required major repair works, and in 2006, further cracks and signs of material fatigue were found. The <b>clip-ons</b> were originally {{to have a life}} expectancy of 50 years. Auckland City Council's Transport Committee requested Transit New Zealand to investigate the future of the <b>clip-ons</b> as part of its ten-year plan. Transit noted that the plan already includes some funding for bridge maintenance.|$|R

25|$|Even at {{the time}} the <b>clip-on</b> {{additions}} to the Auckland Harbour Bridge were being installed in 1969, predictions noted that the increased bridge capacity would last only until about 1985. Even with the <b>clip-on</b> sections and the traffic management in place, the Harbour Bridge was soon experiencing congestion during rush hours again. Various plans were proposed for a second link in the following decades, including one connecting from Meola Reef to Birkenhead, though the idea was abandoned in the 1970s after public outcry.|$|E
25|$|A <b>clip-on</b> tuner clips {{on to an}} instrument—such as {{onto the}} {{headstock}} of a guitar or the bell of a trombone. A vibration sensor built into the clip tranmits the instrument vibrations to the tuning circuitry. The absence of a microphone makes these tuners immune to background noise, so musicians can tune in noisy environments, including while other musicians are tuning. The <b>clip-on</b> tuner was invented in 1995 by Mark Wilson of OnBoard Research Corporation, which marketed it as The Intellitouch Tuner Model PT1.|$|E
25|$|In Britain these popular {{motorised}} cycles {{were known}} as Clément-Garrards. James Lansdowne Norton built Clément bicycle frames under license, and used the Clément <b>clip-on</b> engine for his first Norton motorcycles.|$|E
5000|$|Skorpion Cup — {{essentially}} a Skorpion stripped of road paraphernalia, equipped with <b>clip-ons,</b> full-fairing {{and a single}} seat. It was aimed at one-design MuZ-Cup clubman racing.|$|R
5000|$|Police {{officers}} and security guards often wear <b>clip-ons</b> {{as a precaution}} against being strangled by a pulled necktie. (With uniform, a tie clip {{may be used to}} keep the tie from [...] "flying" [...] in the wind.) ...|$|R
50|$|Yamaha {{introduced}} the TZR125 in 1987 and production ended in 1992. It is {{identified by the}} single square headlight {{at the front of}} the box fairing, <b>clip-ons</b> located on top of the yoke, single seat and conventional forks.|$|R
25|$|Streetfighters {{are derived}} from sport bikes, {{originally}} being customized sport bikes with the fairings removed and higher handlebars replacing the low <b>clip-on</b> handlebars. Since the 1990s, factory streetfighters have been produced. As with naked bike and muscle bike (below), the name streetfighter is used to help clarify the middle ground occupied by designs that blend elements of both sport bikes and standards.|$|E
25|$|As {{engine power}} increased, frame {{ruptures}} became increasingly common, and by 1903 Minerva had developed an in-frame design {{with the engine}} mounted above the bottom bracket, while still also offering the <b>clip-on</b> kit. From 1904 Minerva began focusing more on car production, and while development and production of the Minerva motorized bicycles continued through to about 1909, they became increasing a less {{significant part of the}} company.|$|E
25|$|Typical ways to muffle a snare or tom include placing {{an object}} {{on the outer}} edge of the drumhead. A piece of cloth, a wallet, gel, or fitted rings made of mylar are common objects. Also used are {{external}} <b>clip-on</b> muffles that work using the same principle. Internal mufflers that lie on the inside of the drumhead are often built into a drum, but are generally considered less effective than external muffles, as they stifle the initial tone, rather than simply reducing the sustain of it.|$|E
50|$|Other {{differences}} are purely cosmetic and consist {{of the lack}} of a full fairing, a superbike handlebar instead of <b>clip-ons</b> and different paint schemes. Like the first generation Tuono, the Tuono 1000 R also employs a steering damper as standard.|$|R
5000|$|The {{restyling}} by designers John Mockett and Rod Scivyer saw {{the introduction}} of the twin [...] "bug eye" [...] headlamps which are a Triumph trademark to this day. When introduced in 1997 the T509 had a polished frame. It also had low mount <b>clip-ons.</b> To improve rider comfort and low speed handling, a regular handlebar was fitted from 1998.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Ahlem {{launched}} the acetate collection of products, {{such as their}} debut frame, the Saint-Germain, with the material sourced from Italian acetate specialist Mazzucchelli. In 2015 the first metal frames were introduced whose lightweight palladium frames are dipped in 3 microns of gold. Ahlem frames are paired with Cridal lenses: a hybrid between glass and resin which is very light and incredibly resistant. The lens is coated with an anti-reflective and UVA/UVB protection filter. More recently, Ahlem introduced a series of <b>clip-ons.</b>|$|R
25|$|A recent {{innovation}} is the silicone seal, which is {{claimed to be}} as supple as latex, more flexible, yet far more durable. These are now available as original equipment on some makes of dry suit. Silicone seals are hypoallergenic, but can not be glued to the suit, and must be attached using <b>clip-on</b> rings. The silicone seals are similar in mechanical strength to latex seals but do not deteriorate as rapidly from oxidation and chemical attack. They are initially relatively expensive, but can be replaced without tools by the user which reduces cost of replacement.|$|E
25|$|The Lewis Leather jackets {{differed}} from their American counterparts {{such as the}} Perfecto motorcycle jacket in that during the mid-1950s in the United Kingdom, many young riders were influenced by the riding style of their racing heroes, which was crouched right over the tank, arms forward holding onto <b>clip-on</b> handle bars. In order to wear an American style jacket, various modifications needed to be made such as expansion pleats down {{each side of the}} back and the buckle had to be covered in leather, as the brass buckles found on most American styles would have scratched the tank.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Noten participated among 40 (21 in final) Dutch {{artists and}} {{designers}} in a tiara design competition honouring the marriage between Maxima Zorreguieta and the Dutch crown prince Willem-Alexander. Noten's {{design of a}} shiny chromed polo helmet with a <b>clip-on</b> tiara won first prize. The jury {{referred to it as}} a 'cheeky' design. Noten intended the tiara, with small portraits of all Dutch queens positioned as guardian angels on top, to be used in church during the wedding ceremony. Afterwards the princess could combine the tiara with the helmet to protect herself against paparazzi when she ventured into the city of Amsterdam (or if she felt confident enough her husband might want to wear the helmet).|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to light weight, a tuned engine and minimalist bodywork, the café racer typically features distinctive ergonomics. Dropped bars that are low, narrow handlebars called <b>clip-ons</b> [...] - enabled the rider to [...] "tuck in", reducing wind resistance and improving control. Along with the rearward located seat, the posture often required rearsets, or rear-set footrests and foot controls, again typical of racing motorcycles of the era. Distinctive half or full race-style fairings were sometimes mounted to the forks or frame.|$|R
50|$|Although the S {{model is}} a sport bike with <b>clip-ons</b> and rear-set footrests, the bike is {{nevertheless}} comfortable and capable of touring with a pillion passenger. Its engine is a liquid-cooled 999 cc DOHC 8-valve 4-stroke 40° inclined parallel twin with a 180° crankshaft, and a balance shaft. It has electronic fuel injection, and wet-sump lubrication. It has Nissin brakes, Marzocchi male-slider forks, and an alloy cantilever swingarm rear suspension. Although the engine is compact, the bike is fairly heavy at 208 kg (dry).|$|R
50|$|As {{introduced}} in 1988 for the UK, and the GS500EK model in 1989 for Europe and North America, the bike {{came with a}} black painted engine mounted in a light grey frame and white wheels. These first GS500 bikes had low two-piece handlebars, giving the impression of <b>clip-ons</b> but were in fact mounted to the upper triple tree. In 1990 the handlebars were raised to a more standard height. A California-specific model for 1990 had a reduced fuel capacity, 15.0 L instead of 17 liters, to allow room under the tank for an evaporation canister.|$|R
25|$|Electric Pencil, {{released}} in December 1976, {{was the first}} word processor software for microcomputers. Software-based word processors running on general-purpose personal computers gradually displaced dedicated word processors, and the term came to refer to software rather than hardware. Some programs were modeled after particular dedicated WP hardware. MultiMate, for example, was written for an insurance company that had hundreds of typists using Wang systems, and spread from there to other Wang customers. To adapt to the smaller, more generic PC keyboard, MultiMate used stick-on labels and a large plastic <b>clip-on</b> template to remind users of its dozens of Wang-like functions, using the shift, alt and ctrl keys with the 10 IBM function keys {{and many of the}} alphabet keys.|$|E
25|$|The {{task was}} to create a toy and market it at a show {{attended}} by Sir Alan and toy industry representatives, with the potential for it to be mass-produced and sold to raise money for Comic Relief. The men's team, led by Gerald Ratner, created a belt with <b>clip-on</b> slots to hold collectible figurines, that was suggested by Jonathan Ross. The women's team created a velcro suit that was intended to come in pairs and played somewhat like Twister, including a giant novelty dice that when rolled, instructed players to stick one part of their body to the other player's, with the loser being whoever fell to the floor first. Both teams suffered internal conflicts, with Jonathan Ross forcing many of his ideas through and then not contributing to the speech that {{he was supposed to be}} writing with Jack Dee, while Patsy Palmer became frustrated with Michelle Mone's leadership of their team and very nearly quit. Conflict between Dee and Ross was presented by the BBC in a humorous fashion, and it is likely that both Dee and Ross 'played up' their conflict to entertain the viewer.|$|E
500|$|In late 2007, the FBI {{announced}} that a partial DNA profile had been obtained from three organic samples found on the hijacker's <b>clip-on</b> tie in 2001, though they later acknowledged {{that there is no}} evidence that the hijacker was the source of the sample material. [...] "The tie had two small DNA samples, and one large sample," [...] said Special Agent Fred Gutt. [...] "It's difficult to draw firm conclusions from these samples." [...] The bureau also made public a file of previously unreleased evidence, including Cooper's 1971 plane ticket from Portland to Seattle (price: $20.00, paid in cash), and posted previously unreleased composite sketches and fact sheets, along with a request to the general public for information which might lead to Cooper's positive identification.|$|E
5000|$|Being {{the first}} all-Italian Bimota {{it came with}} a 750 cc Ducati 90° V-twin engine with Desmodromic valve-train in {{different}} levels of tune and styling. The frame is made of Chrome-Molybdenum steel tubing and uses a Triangulated Upper Space Frame or [...] "Birdcage" [...] design. The engine is a stressed member and the swingarm pivots in engine's crankcase. The DB1s triple-trees, <b>clip-ons,</b> rear-sets and several other bits are made of lightweight, hot stamped and billet Avional 14 aluminum. The Cagiva/Bimota/Ducati/DB1 prototype morphed into the Ducati Paso ironically designed by Bimota co-founder Massimo Tamburini.|$|R
50|$|The term café racer {{originated}} in the 1950s, when bikers often frequented transport cafés, using them as starting and finishing points for road races. A café racer is a motorcycle that has been modified for speed and good handling rather than for comfort. Features include: a single racing seat, low handlebars (such as ace bars or one-sided <b>clip-ons</b> mounted directly onto the front forks for control and aerodynamics), large racing petrol tanks (aluminium ones were often polished and left unpainted), swept-back exhaust pipes, rear-set footpegs (to give better clearance while cornering at high speeds) with or without half or full race fairings.|$|R
5000|$|Paul Smart {{rode the}} 750 Imola Desmo {{competition}} bike {{to victory in}} 1972, and the 1974 750 SuperSport was based on that, tank and sidepanels painted silver, fairing painted green and silver with a green frame. The Giugiaro case 900 and 750 SuperSports had the blue and silver paint. The inspiration for Paul Smart LE is based on these bikes. It has multi adjustable Öhlins suspension front and rear, the fairing, steering damper, and a green frame {{to go with the}} silver and blue paint on the tank, lower <b>clip-ons,</b> fairing, and side covers. The Paul Smart was limited to 2000 examples worldwide ...|$|R
500|$|Kapoor {{said that}} of the three {{characters}} he plays—Javed the poet, Govind the struggling musician and Krish the college student—Krish is the closest to himself, but Javed was the most interesting, a type of character he had never played before. Javed uses shayari, a type of poetry, to flirt. [...] "Shayaris are his pickup lines and very often he does succeed to getting the girls," [...] said Kapoor. [...] "He is not a sophisticated shayar and {{that is part of}} his charm." [...] He also called Javed [...] "the funniest and naughtiest character of 1910 I have ever seen." [...] Despite the role being his favourite, Kapoor faced problems with the era-appropriate costume, which required him to wear traditional mojari shoes and <b>clip-on</b> stud earrings; he suffered from both shoe bites and red ears during filming.|$|E
500|$|The Honda Super Cub {{debuted in}} 1958, {{ten years after}} the {{establishment}} of Honda Motor Co. Ltd. The original 1952 Honda Cub F had been a <b>clip-on</b> bicycle engine. Honda kept the name but added the prefix 'Super' for the all-new lightweight machine. The Super Cub sold poorly at first, owing mainly to the recession in Japan, and then three months after the 1958 launch, when customer complaints began rolling in about slipping clutches. Honda salesmen and factory workers gave up holidays to repair the affected Super Cubs, visiting each customer in person. When it was imported to the US, the name was changed to Honda 50, and later Honda Passport C70, and C90, because the Piper Super Cub airplane trademark had precedence. [...] Similarly, [...] in Britain they were only badged 'Honda 50', 'Honda 90' etc. as the Triumph Tiger Cub preceded.|$|E
500|$|By the mid-2000s, whale tails became {{common to}} celebrities, {{providing}} opportunities to the paparazzi. Whale tail display spawned a new accessory [...] <b>clip-on</b> jewelry for the visible straps. Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian claimed that following pop {{stars in the}} hipster trousers {{gave rise to the}} [...] "low-slung jeans, whale-tail G-string era". On 17 September 2004, a writer for the Chicago Sun-Times stated, [...] "Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera regularly were photographed with thong straps riding high above their low-rise jeans. And even usually tasteful Halle Berry succumbed to the thong craze by attending an awards show with bejeweled thong straps peeking out from above her miniskirt." [...] Actresses Gillian Anderson, Natalie Portman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall and Tara Reid, MTV's Molly Sims, model Kate Moss, singers Beyoncé Knowles, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Janet Jackson, LeAnn Rimes and Britney Spears have been associated as propagators of the trend by ABC.|$|E
50|$|Footrests {{were placed}} too far forward for many riders {{and a common}} {{modification}} was to replace them with rearset footrests. Although not suitable for large riders, the 3½ was renowned for sharp and impeccable handling {{and was able to}} compete against larger capacity motorbikes on twisty roads. Maximum torque was above 6,000 rpm and so required high revving, similar to a two-stroke, {{to make the most of}} the engine's characteristics. Nevertheless, a 3½ Sport could still return 70 mpgimp when ridden hard. The 3½ Sport had a higher compression ratio than the softer-tuned Strada. The Sport featured Tomaselli <b>clip-ons</b> handlebars and throttle, a steering damper and Veglia instruments.|$|R
50|$|Almost {{since the}} bridge as built reached capacity, before {{extension}} via the <b>clip-ons,</b> a second {{crossing of the}} harbour was mooted. The high costs and the difficulties of connecting it to the motorway network have so far caused plans to remain at concept stage. In 2008, a study group narrowed down around 160 options to a multi-tunnel link approximately one km east of the bridge, with up to four individual tunnels for motorway, public transport and trains. The proposal has not continued to a political decision or funding stage, though designations are being protected to ensure that development will not prevent the tunnels being built.|$|R
5000|$|Named the Bros in Japan, (The Model name Bros being {{derived from}} Brothers in {{reference}} to the 400cc and 650cc versions which were conceived together as brothers), the NT came in [...] versions. After Honda stopped exporting the Hawk in 1992, they continued the Bros in Japan for one more year. A close ratio gear box (which drops into the Hawk) different wheels, and lower <b>clip-ons</b> were the major changes. A Motor Cycle News review said the Bros 400 is [...] "heavy, underpowered and outdated, ... but surprisingly nice to ride - they’re well balanced, steer well and the engine is flexible, torquey and characterful given its 33bhp output. The Bros has a comfy, semi-upright café racer riding position." ...|$|R
