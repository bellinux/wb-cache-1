This structure, a <b>gutter</b> <b>cast,</b> is interpreted to have formed on a paleo seafloor by scouring and infilling during a large storm, possibly a hurricane. This <b>gutter</b> <b>cast</b> contains another (inner) <b>gutter</b> <b>cast,</b> which we believe is new to the literature. Thin section analysis indicates that the storm lag deposit in the inner <b>gutter</b> <b>cast</b> contains brachiopods, enchinoderms, crinoid stems, and trilobite fragments. Also within the inner <b>gutter</b> <b>cast</b> are two cephalopods with their long axes oriented parallel to a hypothesized sea floor current. Oxygen and carbon isotopic data for lime mud (Â´ 13 C, - 0. 85 to - 0. 97 0 VPDB; Â´ 18 O, - 5. 82 to - 6. 01) and calcite cement (Â´ 13 C, 0. 42 to 0. 75; Â´ 18 O - 4. 93 to - 5. 95) infilling the intraparticle porosity in the cephalopods indicate two sources of carbon and oxygen with the cement generally less negative in both isotopes than the lime mud...|$|R
40|$|Pot <b>casts</b> and <b>gutter</b> <b>casts</b> are {{described}} for the ®rst {{time in the}} lower part of the Majanillos Formation, a Middle Triassic carbonate unit located in the External Zones of the Betic Cordillera (southern Spain). Their identi®cation, as well as their relation to tempestites, enables the better interpretation of the depositional environments and the shoreline-to-offshore facies transition on the Anisian muddy carbonate ramp of the southern Iberian Massif. The Majanillos Formation contains three members, which become progressively more marly towards the top. Well-preserved pot and <b>gutter</b> <b>casts</b> and thin intercalations of calcarenite, which are interpreted as tempestites, are abundant in the lowest member. Above the pot and <b>gutter</b> <b>casts,</b> thicker calcarenite beds, which locally contain hummocky cross-strati®cation, predominate. Bioturbated nodular limestones are prevalent at the top of the member. The remaining succession, which records a long-term Triassic transgressive cycle, consists mostly of ®ne-grained limestones deposited in very shallow-marine environments. Calcarenitic sediments only accumulated within potholes and gutters in the nearshore. They developed during storms when strong currents transported sediment to the outer shelf, where it was deposited as tempestite beds. Pot and <b>gutter</b> <b>casts</b> characterize sedimentation in the bypass zone. It is concluded that storm deposits provide important constraints for the interpretation of palaeobathymetry; it is proposed that <b>gutter</b> <b>casts</b> display a trend of increasing width/thickness ratios towards the outer shelf. The identi®cation of these structures in marine successions elsewhere should prove useful in the interpretation of depositional environments...|$|R

40|$|Lower Triassic (Scythian) {{sedimentary}} sequence {{developed in}} similar lithofacies were studied at two sections in vicinity of Knin - Plavno (in Croatia) and Strmica (in Bosnia and Herzegovina). Characteristics of the Siliciclastic lithofacies, which {{corresponds to the}} Lower Scythian, Seis beds, and of the Mudstone and Siltstone - mudstone lithofacies of Upper Scythian, Campil beds, reflect the storm influence at the shallower and deeper parts of shelf, {{as well as the}} sea-level oscilations resulting in a presumed 5 th, 4 th and 3 rd order cycles. Appearance of <b>gutter</b> <b>casts</b> exposed on lower bedding planes of sedimentary rocks in Mudstone and Siltstone-mudstone lithofacies has been considered as a consequence of bottom current flow component in the outer shelf area. This unidirectional current flow has a helicoidal component with horizontal axis parallel to the sediment surface. The flow generates characteristic storm imprint on the broad shelf area. Lacking any other types of either the biostratigraphic or litostratigraphic marker horizons, this structure, having only one way of formation, allows the improvement of chronostratigraphic correlation of the vertical sequence on both explored locations. The firs appearance of this structure in sediment successions of Plavno and Strmica, may serve as possible correlative marker. Using such a correlative principle <b>gutter</b> <b>casts</b> are in vertical succession grouped in interval, which signifies approximately penecontemporaneous events. Should the correlation be based on the <b>gutter</b> <b>cast</b> structure, the differences in thickness at both location can be explained by their more proximal or more distal position within the sedimentary basin. If this is true, the inveterate principle of correlating the contact between of Lower Scythian and Upper Scythian sediments as a contact between the red, dominantly clastic Seis beds and grey, dominantly calcareous Campil beds, is therefore found to be chronostratigraphically inadequate and can be excluded (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R

40|$|The Upper Ordovician (Katian) {{strata of}} the Cincinnati Arch contain {{numerous}} mudstone units {{known locally as}} ‘butter shales’ or ‘trilobite shales’. Most of these deposits are heavily collected for their excellently-preserved trilobites. The Oldenburg Butter Shale, however, is a previously-undescribed mudstone package from the Waynesville Formation, known only from limited exposure near Oldenburg, Indiana. The Oldenburg Shale is a 2 m-thick mudstone package with minor beds of shelly packstones, and calcisiltite-filled <b>gutter</b> <b>casts.</b> It contains abundant articulated trilobites. The mudstone portion contains illite, chlorite, quartz, calcite and traces of dolomite and pyrite. In outcrop, the shale exhibits no obvious bedding and breaks conchoidally. When cut and polished, the mudstone shows a mottled fabric, containing Lingulichnus and Chondrites trace fossils. The shelly units contain brachiopods, gastropods, and bryozoans. The <b>gutter</b> <b>casts</b> are 20 – 30 cm wide, display hummocky stratification, and contain Lingulichnus. Faunally, the Oldenburg is very unlike surrounding Waynesville strata. Instead of being dominated by brachiopods as is typical, the Oldenburg fauna consists of abundant bivalves (Modiolopsis, Ambonychia, and Caritodens), lingulid brachiopods, and the trilobites (Isotelus, and Flexicalymene, and rare Amphilichas in the upper 30 cm). Articulate brachiopods are represented in the shale to a limited extent by the genera Zygospira and Platystrophia. The shale also contains bryozoans, orthoconic cephalopods, rare crinoids and conulariids. Conodonts and scolecodonts are {{a major component of}} the microfauna. Taphonomy of the fossils, together with sedimentological features, indicates that this butter shale accumulated rapidly as a series of episodes of distal storm-generated mud and silt flows. Towards the top of the mudstone is a horizon of small concretions, about 7 cm wide. Overlying the butter shale is the pyrite crusted surface of the Mid-Richmondian Unconformity which removes the Oldenburg shale in most other locations.

40|$|The Miocene to Modern Baram Delta Province is {{a highly}} {{efficient}} source to sink system that has accumulated 9 to 12 km of coastal-deltaic to shelf sediments over the past 15 Myr. Facies analysis based on ca 1 km of total vertical outcrop stratigraphy, combined with subsurface geology and sedimentary processes in the present-day Baram Delta Province, suggests a ‘storm-flood’ depositional model comprising two distinct periods: (i) fair-weather periods are dominated by alongshore sediment reworking and coastal sand accumulation; and (ii) monsoon-driven storm periods are characterised by increased wave energy and offshore-directed downwelling storm flow that occur simultaneously with peak fluvial discharge caused by storm-precipitation (‘storm-floods’). The modern equivalent environment has the following characteristics: (i) humid-tropical monsoonal climate; (ii) narrow (ca < 100 km) and steep (ca 1 °), densely vegetated, coastal plain; (iii) deep tropical weathering of a mudstone-dominated hinterland; (iv) multiple independent, small to moderate-sized (102 to 105 km 2) drainage basins; (v) predominance of river-mouth bypassing; and (vi) supply-dominated shelf. The ancient, proximal part of this system (the onshore Belait Formation) is dominated by strongly cyclical sandier-upward successions (metre to decametre-scale) comprising (from bottom to top) : (i) finely laminated mudstone with millimetre-scale silty laminae; (ii) heterolithic sandstone-mudstone alternations (centimetre to metre-scale); and (iii) sharp-based, swaley cross-stratified sandstone beds and bedsets (metre to decimetre-scale). <b>Gutter</b> <b>casts</b> (decimetre to metre-scale) are widespread, they are filled with swaley cross-stratified sandstone and their long-axes are oriented perpendicular to the palaeo-shoreline. The <b>gutter</b> <b>casts</b> and other associated waning-flow event beds suggest that erosion and deposition was controlled by high-energy, offshore-directed, oscillatory-dominated, sediment-laden combined flows within a shoreface to delta front setting.

5000|$|From late 1889 {{until about}} 1895, {{there was a}} {{depression}} in Queensland. North Queensland suffered especially, due to a significant downturn in sugar production, and a drought, which peaked in 1889. This had a severe impact on the regional mining industry because the crushing mills needed water. Charters Towers and Croydon were affected and this had a flow-on effect for Burns Philp. Robert Philp had speculated on mining and real estate and had to sell his company shares and resign from the Board in 1893. It suffered a substantial decline in profitability, which in 1893 James Burns blamed on [...] "insane overstocking of Normanton five years ago" [...] with mining supplies. This included 300 pairs of bellows which {{are used in the}} dry-processing of gold. Despite the downturn, approval was given for the addition of a strongroom to the Normanton building, in late 1892. In January 1893 Burns Philp wrote to the Normanton Municipal Council requesting kerb and gutter be installed adjoining their store on Landsborough and Caroline Streets. The tender of £24 from local contractors Copeland and Cant for stone and concrete kerbing was accepted in February.

40|$|The {{near-field}} stratigraphic {{record of}} the Early Silurian glaciations is well documented in the literature. Data from far-field areas are, however, sparse. One of the best far-field stratigraphic records of these Llandovery glaciations is exposed on Anticosti Island in eastern Canada. Eight shallow-water paleotropical facies are present close to the mid-Telychian Jupiter–Chicotte formational boundary along the south-central coast of Anticosti Island. These can be grouped into three facies associations that include, from bottom to top: a carbonate facies association (FA- 1), a mixed siliciclastic and carbonate facies association (FA- 2) and an encrinitic facies association (FA- 3). These mid- to outer-ramp strata represent deposition mostly from episodic, high-energy storm events as evidenced by their sharp bases, hummocky cross-stratification, large wave ripples, <b>gutter</b> <b>casts</b> and wave-enhanced sediment gravity flow deposits. Superimposed on a long-term regressive trend, one main transgressive–regressive (TR) sequence and four meter-scale TR cycles are evident, indicating a multi-order stratigraphic framework developed {{under the influence of}} glacio-eustasy.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Turbidity {{currents}} generated nearshore {{have been}} suggested {{to be the source}} of some sandy marine event beds, but in most cases the evidence is circumstantial. Such flows must commonly travel through a field of oscillatory flow caused by wind-generated waves; little is known, however, about the interactions between waves and turbidity currents. We explore these interactions through detailed process-oriented sedimentological analysis of sandstone event beds from the Pennsylvanian Minturn Formation in north-central Colorado, U. S. A. The Minturn Formation exhibits a complex stratigraphic architecture of fan-delta deposits that developed in association with high topographic relief in a tectonically active setting. An, 20 – 35 -m-thick, unconformity-bounded unit of prodelta deposits consists of dark green shale and turbidite-like sandstone beds with tool marks produced by abundant plant debris. Some of the sandstone event beds, most abundant at distal localities, contain reverse-to-normal grading and sequences of sedimentary structures that indicate deposition from waxing to waning flows. In contrast, proximal deposits, in some cases less than a kilometer away, contain abundant beds with evidence for deposition by wave-dominated combined flows, including large-scale hummocky cross-stratification (HCS). We interpret the majority of these event beds as a record of deposition from hyperpycnal flows, i. e., turbidity currents generated directly from highly concentrated river plumes, which accelerated and decelerated in response to a rising and falling flood discharge. Additional support for this interpretation includes the following: (1) a variety of sole marks including flute and <b>gutter</b> <b>casts,</b> as well as tool marks made by relatively large (up to tens of centimeters across) woody debris (i. e., groove, prod, and chevron marks); (2) consistent unimoda...|$|R
40|$|The upper Llandovery {{succession}} {{across the}} Jupiter-Chicotte formational contact on Anticosti Island, Québec, {{allows us to}} study the sediment dynamics and stratigraphic architecture of a storm-dominated, carbonate ramp. The Anticosti paleotropical ramp was slowly subsiding and recording significant changes in sea level in a far field glacial setting during the early Telychian. Three facies associations, grouping nine facies, are recognized along the E-W outcrop belt, and {{from top to bottom}} as the: (FA- 1) encrinitic carbonate facies, (FA- 2) mixed siliciclastic and carbonate facies, and (FA- 3) non-encrinitic carbonate facies. These mid to outer ramp sediments represent deposition mostly from episodic, high-energy storm events as evidenced by hummocky cross-stratification, large wave ripples, <b>gutter</b> <b>casts,</b> and wave-enhanced sediment-gravity flow deposits. Spatial and temporal changes in siliciclastic content imply basin margin depositional environments in the eastern sections and change in climate regime from arid to humid conditions. The Chicotte deposition marks a major faunal change with the domination of crinoids triggered by increasing siliciclastic supply, rapid sea level fluctuations and change in substrates. The recognition of one major transgressive-regressive (TR) sequence subdivided in distinct meter-scale cycles allows a high resolution E-W correlation. The development of the TR sequence and meter-scale cycles is driven by glacio-eustacy where the main sequence is 4 th order (~ 400 Ky) with superimposed meter-scale cycles that are 5 th and/or 6 th order (~ 100 Ky). Nevertheless, erosional capping surfaces within the more proximal tempestites represent ancient rocky shorelines that developed during forced sea level falls. In order to explain this stratigraphic architecture, a carbonate open-ramp model is proposed with a concave-up profile and a narrow and steep inner ramp in equilibrium with a high-energy coastline...|$|R
40|$|Shallow-marine {{reservoirs}} {{are typically}} complex, containing hierarchically arranged heterogeneity in inter-well volumes, at scales that are challenging to represent in reservoir models. Permeability contrasts associated with clinoforms are one such heterogeneity, but at present {{there are no}} modelling tools available to automate the generation of multiple three-dimensional (3 D) clinoform surfaces. Consequently, clinoforms are rarely incorporated in models of shallow-marine reservoirs, even when their potential impact on flow is recognized. A numerical algorithm that generates multiple 3 D clinoforms is presented. The algorithm is validated via construction of 3 D, surface-based reservoir models of: (1) fluvial-dominated delta-lobe deposits exposed at outcrop (Cretaceous Ferron Sandstone Member, Utah, USA); and (2) a deltaic reservoir using a sparse subsurface dataset (Jurassic Sognefjord Formation, Troll Field, Norwegian North Sea). We use a suite of 3 D reservoir models constructed with the clinoform-modelling algorithm and outcrop-analogue data (Cretaceous Ferron Sandstone Member, Utah) to quantify the impact of clinoforms on fluid flow in the context of: (1) other uncertainties in reservoir characterisation, such as the impact of bed-scale heterogeneity on vertical permeability; and (2) reservoir engineering decisions, including oil production rate. Clinoforms are difficult to identify using production data, but our results indicate that they can significantly influence hydrocarbon recovery and their impact can be larger than that of other geological heterogeneities and of reservoir engineering decisions. Vertical permeability within distal delta-front facies comprising interbedded sandstones and shales {{is found to be}} an important influence on sweep within clinothems. However, it is difficult to characterize these intervals from subsurface datasets. A digital outcrop modelling method is presented and applied to capture the geometry and architecture of sandbodies in such deposits in an outcrop analogue (G 2 parasequence, Grassy Member, Blackhawk Formation, Utah, USA).

40|$|The Palaeoproterozoic Lady Loretta Formation of the Mount Isa Basin, northwestern Queensland, was {{deposited}} {{during a}} series of fluctuations in relative sealevel that constitute an overall regression. The interpreted sedimentary environments range from sub-wavebase to supratidal. Carbonaceous lagoonal sediments host economic stratiform base metal mineralisation. Previous tectono-sedimentary models for the Lady Loretta Formation that invoked a rift-setting and interpreted a regional "basal breccia" as evidence of syn-sedimentary uplift and erosion are disputed. This study interprets the setting as a ramp/shelf with no evidence of large-scale syn-sedimentary tectonic activity. The "basal breccia" is interpreted as a duricrust that has no palaeoenvironmental implications for the depositional setting. Sedimentary structures, microbialites (stromatolites), evaporite pseudomorphs and the arrangement of interpreted depositional environments indicate fluctuations in water depth, tidal influence and storm activity during the deposition of the Lady Loretta Formation. Shale, laminated to massive argillaceous dolostone and fine grained sandstone containing hummocky and swaley cross-stratification are interpreted as the deepest-water facies present. Shallow marine carbonates now consist of variably silicified dolostone and include microbialites that range from prone mat to biostromes and bioherms of domal, digitate and columnar forms with significant synoptic relief. Ooid shoals developed in areas of shallow agitated water. Widespread mixed carbonate/siliciclastics and carbonates in the northern outcrops of the Lady Loretta Formation appear to be cyclic and developed as a facies mosaic. They are interpreted as peritidal {{on the basis of}} bipolar-bimodal palaeocurrent directions and the prevalence of flaser to lenticular bedded units, tidal rhythmites, interference wave ripples and herringbone cross-stratification with reactivation surfaces. Storm deposits such as imbricated plate breccias and <b>gutter</b> <b>casts</b> are common. Widespread casts and moulds of halite and pseudomorphs of discoidal gypsum, enterolithic anhydrite and cauliflower cherts are interpreted to represent an evaporitic overprint produced during regression when a marine sabkha developed locally.

Highly carbonaceous pyritic shale, variably diagenetically altered Fe- and Mn-rich carbonates and dolomitic siltstone were deposited in isolated areas, laterally and stratigraphically associated with tidal and possible subaerial facies.

Differences in grain sizes, vertical stratification sequences, and bed thicknesses between outcrops are interpreted to result from the spatial distribution of wave effects, the time history of hyperpycnal flows, and the interaction of these processes.

During this Siluro-Devonian Period, a high subsidence occurs stacked sediment bodies and organic-rich shales were deposited in many places that respectively form important hydrocarbon reservoirs and source rocks throughout North Africa basins and Arabia (Boot et al., 1998; Lüning et al., 2000), which lead Algeria to hold the fourth position in terms of the estimates of technically recoverable shale oil and shale gas resources, based on major basin assessment in the world (EIA, 2013). In the prolific Illizi and Berkine basins (western Ghadames, Algeria) a basin-wide approach is needed, especially with the new “shale gas and shale oil” frontier in the upcoming years, in order to capture regional trends and re-assessment on organic-rich (‘hot’) shale unites which in smaller-scale industrial studies are overlooked. Berkine Basin covers nearly 102. 000 km 2. This basin has been a thick sedimentary series of 7000 m corresponding to complex reservoirs but also black shales of the basal Silurian and Frasnian respectively major and secondary source rock systems. Wireline-logs from more than 146 (Berkine – Illizi Basins) Algerian petroleum exploration wells have been studies (Djouder et al., 2012; Djouder et al., 2014), and recently 03 months extensive field study of outcrops of the Siluro-Devonian sediments was carried out at the south margin (SE, Tassili n’Ajjer) of the basin. The following analysis incorporates biostratigraphic, ichnological, sedimentological and high resolution stratigraphic data, which provides a framework evolution from offshore to deltaic deposition for the Silurian then fluvial to normal-marine depositional conditions for the Devonian. A total of 06 short-term, third-order sequences can be identified for the Silurian deposits: (i) 'Hot Shale' Oued Imihrou Formation, organic-rich shales with carbonates nodules (Si- 1); (ii) above is the Atafaïtafa Formation 500 to 650 m thick with HCS, <b>gutter</b> <b>casts</b> and Cruziana Ichnofacies (Si- 2, Si- 3); (iii) then overlaid by coarsening-shallowing-upward units. These sequences (Si- 4, Si- 5 & Si- 6) with Storm-wave dominated and Skolithos Ichnofacies are interpreted to reflect deltaic origin. This delta {{is the result of a}} significant sea-level drop during the Upper Silurian (Beuf et al, 1971) but also from the high sedimentation rates prograding northwards (Eschard et al., 2005). Devonian deposit also can be divided into fourth third-order sequences (Dev- 1 to 4), by the same previous analysis. The base of the cycle is the Caledonian unconformity linked to a tectonic event which affected most of the Gondwanan margin at the Silurian – Devonian boundary and a major relative sea-level fall (Eschard et al., 2005). Previous sequences defined from Tassili n’Ajjer outcrops are well recognized at the basin-scale (Berkine Basin) and can be correlated in the subsurface of the Illizi – Berkine basins (Djouder et al., 2012). Finally, the full depositional cycle for the Silurian – Devonian is reached and capped by the Frasnian maximum flooding surface, with black shales across North Africa (Algeria, western Libya and southern Tunisia) and which are also developed in many parts of the world (Lüning et al., 2003) ...|$|R
