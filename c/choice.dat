30|$|Types of <b>choices.</b> <b>Choices</b> {{are defined}} {{based on the}} {{characteristics}} of interpretation, justification, and functionality of specific behavioral decisions.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to examine, on the one hand, whether adult {{television}} viewers’ <b>choices</b> are influenced by their childhood experience (i. e., their parents’ viewing <b>choices)</b> and, on the other hand, whether their <b>choices</b> are influenced by their current context (e. g., their partners’ <b>choices).</b> The sample consists of 844 heterosexual couples. Genre <b>choices</b> made by each respondent's parents (when the respondent was 15 years old) were measured using retrospective questions about exposure to two genres: television news and soap series. Meanwhile, genre <b>choices</b> made by each respondent's partners were collected using self-reported questions about news and soaps. structural equation modelling was used to analyze the data. The results show that, first, adult television viewers’ <b>choices</b> are predicted by their parents’ <b>choices</b> that the respondents experienced when they were about 15 years old. Second, male partners have more influence on their female partners’ television <b>choices</b> than the other way around. Third, both intergenerational and inter-partner influences on television <b>choices</b> are exerted through the preferences of the present household members...|$|R

40|$|When {{choosing}} between immediate and temporally delayed goods, people sometimes decide disadvantageously. Here, {{we aim to}} provide process-level insight into differences between individually determined advantageous and disadvantageous <b>choices.</b> Participants played a computer game, deciding between two different rewards of varying size and distance by moving an agent towards the chosen reward. We calculated individual models of advantageous <b>choices</b> and characterized the decision process by analyzing mouse movements. The larger amount of participants' <b>choices</b> was classified as advantageous and the disadvantageous <b>choices</b> were biased towards choosing sooner/smaller rewards. The deflection of mouse movements indicated more conflict in disadvantageous <b>choices</b> compared with advantageous <b>choices</b> when the utilities of the options differed clearly. Further process oriented analysis revealed that disadvantageous <b>choices</b> were biased by a tendency for choice-repetition and an undervaluation of the value information in favour of the delay information, making rather simple <b>choices</b> harder than could be expected from {{the properties of the}} decision situation...|$|R
