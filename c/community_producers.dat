Under 2002-61, community channels can be run by independent community groups, and up to one-half of the channel must be made available for independent <b>community</b> <b>producers.</b>|$|E

50|$|On 12 July 2007, the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts had {{implemented}} {{changes to}} the Indigenous Broadcasting Program {{in support of a}} new national indigenous TV channel. It was decided that the existing open-narrowcast licence from Imparja would be used to initially carry the channel, which resulted in ICTV ceasing transmission. For 2 years, ICTV Limited had no means of broadcasting content unless it was commissioned by National Indigenous Television, which was at odds with the company. The NITV commissioning model allegedly left out remote <b>community</b> <b>producers</b> {{due to the nature of}} how funding was allocated and other mandatory requirements.|$|E

East Ayrshire Council, who originally gave £5000 to fund the project, refused to give further finance, stating that it didn't feel it would contribute to the <b>community.</b> <b>Producer,</b> Broughan, called the decision [...] "a disgrace". It took three years for the project to get back on track. Broughan was joined by producer Damita Nikapota on the project who secured pre-production finance from Freewheel Productions.

50|$|Manhattan Neighborhood Network (MNN), the country’s largest {{community}} media center, is {{a non-profit}} organization that broadcasts programming on five public-access television cable TV stations in Manhattan, New York City. MNN operates two community media centers - in midtown Manhattan and East Harlem - and provides education, equipment, facilities, and programs to <b>community</b> <b>producers</b> and organizations who want to create programming to air on one of MNN's five channels.

5000|$|IndiaUnheard, is {{a program}} that is {{constituted}} {{of a network of}} [...] "community correspondents" [...] who are stringers trained to tell stories about their own communities. IndiaUnheard Community Correspondents make 3-4 min videos for which Video Volunteers pays Rs 1300 each. These videos are later shown on social networking sites and sometimes on TV which link rural communities with a truly global audience.This is the only program that Video Volunteers runs on its own, while all others are run with funding from other NGOs where Video Volunteers is only the trainer. [...] This was Video Volunteers’ flagship Community Video Unit program, created in partnership with many of the leading NGOs in India, establishes and equips locally-operated video production units in severely media-deprived areas. By training eight - ten local <b>Community</b> <b>Producers</b> that make up each unit in all aspects of video production, this enables them to produce films that address issues relevant to their community, such as child marriage, health, temple prostitution, water, sanitation and women’s rights. Regular screenings of the films are held for hundreds of villagers in their locale, followed by solution-centric discussions that transform ideas and images into proactive measures. However, currently none of the CVU are in production for lack of fund.|$|E

This paper describes and analyzes these potentials and demonstrates their feasibility with real world cases of community forest businesses and innovative policies and business partnerships. This preliminary assessment is offered as a first step in a longer-term effort to understand existing forest product and service markets, and to identify the most promising market opportunities for local <b>community</b> <b>producers,</b> focusing particularly on developing countries. Part I presents the broader context of forestry’s changing relation to rural development and poverty reduction. Part II develops a framework for considering which market niches have potential for poor producers. Part III proposes strategies and targeted actions to realize that potential...|$|E

These include how [...] "New Media" [...] should be defined and how the role of a New Media producer differs from or is similar to its counterpart in traditional media, recognizing that medium must serve the story and not the other way around.|$|R
40|$|Herbivorous {{top-down}} {{forces and}} bottom-up competition for nutrients determine the coexistence and relative biomass patterns of producer species. Combining models of predator–prey and producer–nutrient interactions with a structural model of complex food webs, I investigated these two aspects in a dynamic food-web model. While competitive exclusion leads to persistence {{of only one}} producer species in 99. 7 % of the simulated simple <b>producer</b> <b>communities</b> without consumers, embedding the same <b>producer</b> <b>communities</b> in complex food webs generally yields producer coexistence. In simple <b>producer</b> <b>communities,</b> the <b>producers</b> with the most efficient nutrient-intake rates increase in biomass until they competitively exclude inferior producers. In food webs, herbivory predominantly reduces the biomass density of those producers that dominated in <b>producer</b> <b>communities,</b> which yields a more even biomass distribution. In contrast to prior analyses of simple modules, this facilitation of producer coexistence by herbivory {{does not require a}} trade-off between the nutrient-intake efficiency and the resistance to herbivory. The local network structure of food webs (top-down effects of the number of herbivores and the herbivores' maximum consumption rates) and the nutrient supply (bottom-up effect) interactively determine the relative biomass densities of the producer species. A strong negative feedback loop emerges in food webs: factors that increase producer biomasses also increase herbivory, which reduces producer biomasses. This negative feedback loop regulates the coexistence and biomass patterns of the producers by balancing biomass increases of producers and biomass fluxes to herbivores, which prevents competitive exclusion...|$|R
