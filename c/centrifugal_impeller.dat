40|$|Abstract: In a {{conventional}} one-dimensional scheme design of centrifugal fans and compres-sors, {{it is assumed}} that there is no flow prewhirl at the impeller inlet when the inlet guide vane is absent. However, many experiments have proved that the flow prewhirl does exist at the inlet of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>impellers.</b> This results in an error in the design of centrifugal fans and compressors. In this study a new method is presented to calculate the Euler work of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>impellers</b> con-sidering the presence of an inlet flow prewhirl in the case without the inlet guide vane. Stodola’s approachdealingwith the slip velocity at the impeller outlet is applied to the impeller inlet. A new formula for Euler work calculation is deduced to evaluate the effect of the inlet prewhirl. The new formula has been applied to 33 industrial centrifugal fans and the calculated results have been compared with the experimental data of these fans. The comparison shows that the new formula is more accurate in most cases than the original formula without consideration of the inlet flow prewhirl, and the accuracy has been improved by more than 10 per cent on average. The aim {{of this study is to}} improve the accuracy of the one-dimensional scheme design of centrifugal fans and to provide a reference for a similar research...|$|R

40|$|Rotating stall, a {{phenomenon}} that causes flow instabilities and pressure hysteresis by propagating at some fraction of the impeller rotational speed, can occur in <b>centrifugal</b> <b>impellers,</b> mixed impellers, radial diffusers, or axial diffusers.
