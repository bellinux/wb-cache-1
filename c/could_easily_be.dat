5|$|A paper {{documenting the}} {{discovery}} was {{prepared by the}} team {{and sent to the}} journal Physical Review in March 1941, but publication was delayed until a year after the end of World War II due to security concerns. At the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather realized that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product. They calculated that element 94 would be fissile, and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium, and <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> separated from it.|$|E

5|$|A second {{strategy}} was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual {{strategy was}} adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 80 {{percent of the}} Abrahams Creek {{watershed}} is rural and 20 percent is urbanized. The lower reaches of the watershed contain most of the urbanization. Its upper reaches contain second-growth forest, small patches of residential land, linear hedgerows, and agricultural land such as hay pastures, pastures, and farmland. The Bunker Hill-Mount Lookout Ridge is too steep to be developed, but many {{other areas of the}} watershed <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> urbanized. The mining-affected land in the watershed is in West Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E

Some French balloons had remained hydrogen-filled for over a year without appreciable loss of buoyancy. As for the hydrogen, filling the balloon at the launch site <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> done with the help of mobile hydrogen manufacturing units; for the steering he referred to his own drag-rope experiments with the Svea, stating that a deviation of 27degrees from the wind direction could be routinely achieved.|$|E
5|$|Daily fantasy {{services}} have historically blocked residents of Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana and Washington {{from participating in}} paid games, under a presumption that DFS is illegal in these states due to the strictness of their gambling laws. However, a November 2015 investigation by The New York Times found that these geoblock restrictions <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> circumvented using anonymous proxies, and {{it was estimated that}} in 2014, DraftKings had still collected $484,897 in entry fees from players in the five states where it had voluntarily asserted that DFS was illegal. These reports led to regulatory probes by investigators in the aforementioned states. Both websites have since implemented measures to block proxy users.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to its earlier place amongst the wealthy, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the pasty became popular with working people in Cornwall, where tin miners and others adopted it {{due to its}} unique shape, forming a complete meal that could be carried easily and eaten without cutlery.

5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Robert Harrington led {{a search}} to {{determine}} the real cause of the apparent irregularities. He calculated that any PlanetX would be at roughly three times the distance of Neptune from the Sun; its orbit would be highly eccentric, and strongly inclined to the ecliptic—the planet's orbit would be at roughly a 32-degree angle from the orbital plane of the other known planets. This hypothesis was met with a mixed reception. Noted PlanetX sceptic Brian G. Marsden of the Minor Planet Center pointed out that these discrepancies were a hundredth the size of those noticed by Le Verrier, and <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> due to observational error.|$|E
5|$|Inside No. 9 is an {{anthology}} series, with each episode featuring a new story, {{with a new}} setting and new characters.

5|$|Public {{dissatisfaction with}} the newly-issued Morgan dollar led the Mint's {{engravers}} to submit designs for the smaller silver coins in 1879. Among those who called for new coinage was editor Richard Watson Gilder of The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Sometime in the early 1880s, he, along {{with one of his}} reporters and sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens visited Mint Director Burchard to argue for the creation of new designs. They brought along classic Greek and Roman coins in an attempt to persuade Burchard that the coinage <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> made more beautiful. The visitors left disappointed, after learning that Burchard considered the much-criticized Morgan dollar as beautiful as any of them.|$|E

5|$|The Device Forts {{emerged as}} a result of changes in English {{military}} architecture and foreign policy in the early 16th century. During the late medieval period, the English use of castles as military fortifications had declined in importance. The introduction of gunpowder in warfare had initially favoured the defender, but soon traditional stone walls <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> destroyed by early artillery. The few new castles that were built during this time still incorporated the older features of gatehouses and crenellated walls, but intended them more as martial symbols than as practical military defences. Many older castles were simply abandoned or left to fall in disrepair.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} matter {{is made up}} of {{discrete}} units is a very old one, appearing in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India. However, these ideas were founded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence and experimentation. Because of this, they could not convince everybody, so atomism was but {{one of a number of}} competing theories on the nature of matter. It was not until the 19th century that the idea was embraced and refined by scientists, as the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries that <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> explained using the concept of atoms.|$|E
