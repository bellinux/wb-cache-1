40|$|Lunch Buddy (LB) mentoring, {{a type of}} school-based mentoring, holds {{promise as}} a {{selective}} intervention {{for children who are}} chronically bullied (Elledge, Cavell, Ogle, 2 ̆ 6 Newgent, 2010). This study expanded upon previous research (Elledge et al., 2010) by utilizing a case-study approach combining qualitative and quantitative methods to gain more evidence about the palatability of the intervention and to uncover possible mechanisms by which the intervention is working. Participants were four elementary school children in grades four and five who had been identified as bullied based on child and teacher reports. Quantitative data were collected at multiple points during the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> mentoring, and <b>qualitative</b> <b>interviews</b> with key stakeholders were conducted post-mentoring. Results supported the promise of LB mentoring for bullied children but also revealed outcomes that varied by assessment source and point of assessment. Thematic analysis supported the palatability of LB mentoring and identified factors that could potentially affect the process of mentoring...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{measurement}} and optimization of re-entry {{into the community}} after injury depends on a degree of understanding of how those injured persons actually perceive their community. In light of the limited research about foundational concepts regarding community integration after spinal cord injury, this study investigated how {{a large number of}} adults with spinal cord injury described their local communities. In the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> telephonic <b>interviews,</b> <b>qualitative</b> descriptions <b>of</b> community were obtained from 269 participants (1 - 56 years postinjury). These were thematically analysed for content and valence by three researchers. In addition to descriptions of community as 'place', findings echoed the three dimensions commonly included in measures of community integration, namely social integration, occupation and independent living. Participants who described their community in social and relationship terms reflected generally positive views about that community, whereas those who described their community in terms of physical space and access expressed a relatively greater proportion of negative views when describing their community. In general, substantial diversity of responses across participants suggested a need for greater complexity in understanding, {{measurement and}} clinical application of the notion of community within the area of community integration and participation. Specifically, the importance of focusing on social and relationship dimensions of community integration is emphasized for rehabilitation practice.

40|$|In {{the latter}} half of the twentieth century and in the early phases of the twenty-first century, {{interviews}} maintain their position as the research method of choice within the social sciences and, as a consequence, also within the discipline of tourism. So much so has the interview method dominated, that we have been described as living in an "interview society" (Silverman, 1993, 1997; Fontana and Frey, 2000; Gubrium and Holstein 2002). In an interview society, interviews are used to make sense of and understand the world in which we live on a daily basis, either at the informal or formal level. Whilst such a society is primarily associated with the western world, due to globalisation, internationalisation and the spread of the knowledge economy as well as western research practices, interviewing is becoming a global research method for understanding and making sense of the lives of the peoples of this world. However, interviews are not all the same, each follows different 'rules', procedures or guidelines, and are embedded in different philosophical backgrounds. As a consequence, the purpose of this chapter is to consider the overall continuum of interviewing, different types of interviews and then to hone in on <b>qualitative</b> <b>interviewing.</b> In particular, the chapter will overview some of the differing definitions <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>interviewing,</b> the philosophical underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>interviewing</b> in contrast to quantitative interviewing, some practical guidelines for <b>qualitative</b> <b>interviewing,</b> debates associated with <b>qualitative</b> <b>interviewing,</b> representations from a case study informed by <b>qualitative</b> <b>interviewing,</b> and final reflections regarding the place <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>interviewing</b> in tourism research.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{several issues}} related to validity in qualitative research and, more specifically, explores {{the ways in which}} validity has been discussed and applied in research with <b>qualitative</b> <b>interviews.</b> The central question is to what extent, if at all, traditional positivist validity criteria are applicable, but also relevant, for evaluation <b>of</b> research with <b>qualitative</b> <b>interviewing.</b> The <b>qualitative</b> <b>interview</b> has been chosen as the focal point of this paper because of its peculiarity in terms {{of the relationship between the}} interviewer and the interviewee or, in other words, the ways in which during an interview meaning and narrative are constructed through discourse between the participants. The importance of the relationship (with its characteristics) between research participants (interviewer and interviewee) for the outcome <b>of</b> a <b>qualitative</b> <b>interview</b> cannot be overemphasized and is as such of particular interest for the assessment of its validity. I introduce and summarize the main approaches to the study and establishment of validity and scrutinize their significance for the example <b>of</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>interviewing</b> and research in particular. This paper shows the importance of considering research context (in this instance interview) for any assessment of validity, if validity at all ought to assume the same role in qualitative and quantitative research.
