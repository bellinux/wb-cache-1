5|$|During {{the winter}} {{solstice}} meeting, the gods are finally convinced by Artemis {{to take action against}} the Titans. Thalia is also asked by Artemis to become an immortal Huntress, and her acceptance {{is the only thing that}} prevents the onset of the Great Prophecy. Percy is told by his father that Luke is somehow not dead, and he and Annabeth return to Camp Half-Blood worried about the future. Before he <b>can</b> <b>relax,</b> however, Percy is forced to explain Bianca's death to Nico. Nico blames Percy, and when a group of spartoi arrive to attack the son of Poseidon, Nico banishes them to the realm of Hades, and Percy realizes that he must be a son of Hades. Nico runs away, and the only people Percy tells the truth are Annabeth and Grover. They promise to hide this fact from everyone else, especially the Titan's army.|$|E

25|$|A {{molecule}} in S1 <b>can</b> <b>relax</b> {{by various}} competing pathways. It can undergo non-radiative relaxation {{in which the}} excitation energy is dissipated as heat (vibrations) to the solvent. Excited organic molecules can also relax via conversion to a triplet state, which may subsequently relax via phosphorescence, or by a secondary non-radiative relaxation step.|$|E
25|$|Gay travel {{destinations}} {{are popular}} among practitioners of gay tourism because they usually have permissive or liberal attitudes towards gays, feature a prominent gay infrastructure (bars, businesses, restaurants, hotels, nightlife, entertainment, media, organisations, etc.), {{the opportunity to}} socialize with other gays, and the feeling that one <b>can</b> <b>relax</b> safely among other gay people.|$|E

25|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that intermodulation distortion is not present in the live audio and so it represents an artificial coloration to the live sound. One advantage of higher sampling rates is that they <b>can</b> <b>relax</b> the low-pass filter design requirements for ADCs and DACs, but with modern oversampling sigma-delta converters this advantage is less important.|$|E
25|$|The whole human GI tract {{is about}} nine metres (30 feet) long at autopsy. It is {{considerably}} shorter {{in the living}} body because the intestines, which are tubes of smooth muscle tissue, maintain constant muscle tone, somewhat like a Slinky that maintains itself in a halfway-tense state but <b>can</b> <b>relax</b> in spots to allow for local distention, peristalsis, and so on.|$|E

25|$|In the {{international}} jetty, {{there is a}} large area where passengers <b>can</b> <b>relax</b> before their flight. Travelers are able to download to their smartphone or e-reader the first chapter of any books available on the platform Lire vous transporte. After that, they can choose to buy the entire book through the Wi-Fi network in the airport. A rest area has been constructed near gate 57 in order to read these books in a calm environment, with cushions and dimmed lights. There are over 1000 chairs with charging stations and USB ports throughout the jetty as well as three water bottle-filling stations.|$|E
25|$|On {{designated}} weekends, Hogwarts {{students in}} their third year or higher, with a signed permission slip, are permitted {{to walk to the}} nearby wizarding village of Hogsmeade, where they <b>can</b> <b>relax</b> and enjoy the pubs, restaurants and shops. There appears to be a good relationship between the school and the village, and the students get on well with the locals. Favourite places in Hogsmeade include Honeydukes Sweetshop, Zonko's Joke Shop, clothing stores such as Gladrags Wizardwear, the Shrieking Shack (regarded as the most haunted building in Britain), the pubs The Three Broomsticks and The Hog's Head, and Madam Puddifoot's coffee shop.|$|E
25|$|Research {{indicates}} that anal sex occurs significantly less frequently than other sexual behaviors, but {{its association with}} dominance and submission, as well as taboo, makes it an appealing stimulus to people of all sexual orientations. In addition to sexual penetration by the penis, people may use sex toys such as butt plugs or anal beads, engage in fingering, anilingus, pegging, anal masturbation or fisting for anal sexual activity, and different sex positions may also be included. Fisting is the least practiced of the activities, partly because it is uncommon that people <b>can</b> <b>relax</b> enough to accommodate an object {{as big as a}} fist being inserted into the anus.|$|E

25|$|Snoopy {{is lying}} {{on top of his}} doghouse, {{relaxing}} vacantly and peacefully. He begins to daydream about being a wild jungle beast. In a few minutes, however, he is back to his peaceful state ("Snoopy"). Linus enters, holding his blanket and sucking his thumb. Lucy and Sally show up and mock him for this habit. Linus decides to abandon his blanket and move on, only to come running back to it in desperation. After the girls leave, Linus daydreams of a blanket fantasy where everyone <b>can</b> <b>relax</b> with their blankets ("My Blanket and Me"). Lucy later tells him that she would someday like to be a queen. However, Linus tells her that she can't and she threatens to punch him. Sally gets a C for her pathetic coat-hanger sculpture.|$|E

[...] In another review, for The Times, Williams opined that, of all the Beatles' solo releases thus far, Harrison's album [...] "makes {{far and away the}} best listening, perhaps because it is the one which most nearly continues the tradition they began eight years ago". William Bender of Time magazine described it as an [...] "expressive, classically executed personal statement... one of the outstanding rock albums in years", while Don Heckman wrote in The New York Times: [...] "If anyone had any doubts that George Harrison was a major talent, they <b>can</b> <b>relax...</b> This is a release that shouldn't be missed." ...|$|E
