50|$|A. S. Hornby was {{a teacher}} of English studies at a small college in Japan; he had gone there in 1923 to teach literature, but his {{experiences}} in the classroom drew {{his attention to the}} need for sound principles of language teaching. At that time Harold E. Palmer headed the Institute for Research into English Teaching in Tokyo, and in 1931 he invited Hornby to work on vocabulary development at the Institute. The result of this was the Idiomatic and Syntactic Dictionary, published by Kaitakusha in 1942. A year before publication, Hornby had managed to send an advance <b>copy</b> <b>in</b> <b>sheets</b> of the book to B. Ifor Evans at the British Council, a tough feat during the war. Ifor Evans offered him a job, and in 1942 Hornby came back to Britain and joined the Council, which posted him to Iran.|$|E
