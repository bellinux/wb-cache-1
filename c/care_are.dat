50|$|The {{cost-effectiveness}} {{of preventive}} <b>care</b> <b>is</b> a highly debated topic.

50|$|Home care, (also {{referred}} to as domiciliary care, social care, or in-home <b>care),</b> <b>is</b> supportive <b>care</b> provided in the home. <b>Care</b> may <b>be</b> provided by licensed healthcare professionals who provide medical care needs or by professional caregivers who provide daily care to help to ensure the {{activities of daily living}} (ADLs) are met.

5|$|As Emmanuil Gushansky states, today {{subjective}} {{position of}} a Russian patient toward a medical psychologist and psychiatrist is defensive in nature and prevents the attempt to understand the patient and help him assess his condition. Such a position is related to constant, subconscious fear of psychiatrists and psychiatry. This fear is caused by not only abuse of psychiatry, but also constant violence in the totalitarian and post-totalitarian society. The psychiatric violence and psychiatric arrogance as one of manifestations of such violence {{is related to the}} primary emphasis on symptomatology and biological causes of a disease, while ignoring psychological, existential, and psychodynamic factors. Gushainsky notices that the modern Russian psychiatry and the structure of providing mental health <b>care</b> <b>are</b> aimed not at protecting the patient's right to an own place in life, but at discrediting such a right, revealing symptoms and isolating the patient.|$|E
5|$|Salford Royal Hospital dated back to 1830 and was {{extended}} in 1911. It {{was closed and}} converted into flats. The modern Salford Royal, at Hope, near the boundary with Eccles, was opened in 1882 as the Salford Union Infirmary. Later renamed Hope Hospital and then again as Salford Royal, it is a large NHS hospital administrated by Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust. In a 2006–07 review of all 394 NHS Trusts in England by the Healthcare Commission, Salford Royal was one of 19 to be rated excellent in its quality of services and its use of resources.

5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the hospice {{philosophy}} <b>is</b> that the <b>care</b> <b>is</b> patient-centered, to treat the whole patient.

Palliative consultation teams provide specialist palliative care competencies for staff caring for patients in primary care, nursing homes and in hospitals. Efforts to increase knowledge and skills in palliative <b>care</b> <b>is</b> needed at undergraduate university level and through postgraduate and specialist training.

In contrast, when <b>care</b> <b>is</b> monetary, injurers may take {{too much or too}} little care under strict liability, and <b>care</b> <b>is</b> not strictly increasing in injurer wealth.

40|$|A {{pilot study}} {{set out to}} explore how {{pastoral}} <b>care</b> <b>was</b> experienced by staff and students at Southern Cross University on the mid north coast of New South Wales in Australia.

Participants believed that pastoral <b>care</b> <b>is</b> a vital component of the University student experience, shaping student attitudes, willingness and even ability to continue with their studies. At Southern Cross University, both administrative and academic staff see themselves as providing pastoral care to students. Students and staff alike agreed that pastoral <b>care</b> <b>was</b> important, but how such <b>care</b> <b>is</b> provided was the subject of considerable discussion within the focus groups.

25|$|Medical {{observation}} and supportive <b>care</b> <b>are</b> {{the mainstay of}} treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. Although benzodiazepines are absorbed by activated charcoal, gastric decontamination with activated charcoal is not beneficial in pure benzodiazepine overdose as the risk of adverse effects would outweigh any potential benefit from the procedure. It is recommended only if benzodiazepines have been taken {{in combination with other}} drugs that may benefit from decontamination. Gastric lavage (stomach pumping) or whole bowel irrigation are also not recommended. Enhancing elimination of the drug with hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, or forced diuresis is unlikely to be beneficial as these procedures have little effect on the clearance of benzodiazepines due to their large volume of distribution and lipid solubility.|$|E
25|$|Most {{congenital}} {{patients are}} now in their forties and fifties and their health is deteriorating.

One notable example is , a vocational training centre for congenital patients {{as well as other}} disabled people in the Minamata area. Hot House members are also involved in raising awareness of Minamata disease, often attending conferences and seminars as well as making regular visits to elementary schools throughout Kumamoto Prefecture.|$|E
