It was first marketed by IBM Systems Supplies Division (SSD) in 1972. The processor washed fresh blood or frozen, thawed blood. In {{the case of}} frozen, thawed blood, the blood was washed to remove the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>agent,</b> typically, glycerol.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} easy {{technique}} is {{proposed for the}} preparation of dry hexamethylenediammonium adipate (HMA salt), using conventional dry-blending equipment. The process includes contacting adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine, {{in the presence of}} a cryogenic medium, which is used to depress the exothermic of the salt formation. The purpose is the formation of free-flowing HMA salt with good homogeneity and balanced end groups, which can be used as a starting intermediate in the polyamide industry. Critical parameters were studied, such as the nature and amount of <b>cryogenic</b> <b>agent</b> and the presence of water traces in the reacting mixture. Application in an industrial scale seems feasible so that all advantages of handling dry HMA salt instead of its components (adipic acid powder and hexamethylenediamine liquid) can be utilized.

40|$|Nowadays, sperm {{evaluation}} is mostly {{used to predict}} fertility and freezability. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the possibility of investigating the effects of the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>agent</b> on boar spermatozoa, by identifying a set of laboratory tests for a rapid and efficient evaluation of semen quality. Usual sperm analysis such as sperm concentration, motility and spermatozoa morphology are not able to show subtle abnormalities, which are having a basic role in the fertilizing ability. Moreover, it seems that other sperm characteristics, involved in the fertilizing ability, can interfere with the freezing-thawing processes, being not evaluated or maybe not known. Morphological (microscopic analysis of stained spermatozoa), functional (motility analysis and hypo-osmotic swelling test) and chromatin integrity (Acridine Orange Test and Comet Assay) analysis were performed aiming to show the differences in spermatozoon integrity and functionality, caused by the cryogenic factor...|$|E
40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} {{are the most}} important bacteria having potential as probiotic. The objectives of the present study were to examine the growth of Lactic Acid Bacteria, identify the Lactic Acid Bacteria capable of surviving and evaluate the best <b>cryogenic</b> <b>agents</b> that protect the viability of Lactic Acid Bacteria during freeze drying. Four <b>cryogenic</b> <b>agents,</b> i. e. sucrose, lactose, skim milk and maltodextrin, were used in freeze drying of three species of Lactic Acid Bacteria, i. e. Pediococcus pentosaceus A 16, Lactobacillus brevis A 17 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus R 21 isolated from breast milk. Evaluation included viability before and after freeze drying, survival of freeze dried culture in 0. 5 % bile salt and low pH for 5 hours. The result showed that three of cryogenics, i. e. sucrose, lactose and skim milk improved the viability of freeze dried of all lactobacilli, except maltodextrin that did not give protection to L. rhamnosus R 21. Evaluation on the survival of LAB in 0. 5 % bile salt showed that <b>cryogenic</b> <b>agents</b> improved the survival rate of all Lactic Acid Bacteria during freeze drying. The cryogenic also improved the survival rate of LAB at low pH, with the best protection given by skim milk on L. rhamnosus R 21...|$|R
40|$|Cryosurgery uses low {{temperature}} to induce tissue necrosis {{with the intent}} of ablation by four processes: freezing, holding of freeze, thawing, and repetition of these cycles. A minor cryogenic injury leads only to an inflammatory response, whereas a major cryogenic injury causes tissue destruction. James Arnott 1 was the first to use cryosurgery for treatment of skin lesions, breast cancer, and cervical cancer. In the past, solid carbon dioxide, cold-air blast, and liquid nitrogen were used as <b>cryogenic</b> <b>agents</b> in the treatment of benign and malignant tumours. 2 Cage 3 showed in 1966 that liquid nitrogen induced bone necrosis in malignant oral-cavity lesions of soft tissues, followed by new bone formation and complete recovery. Moreover, Marcove and Miller 4 were pioneers of orthopaedic cryosurgery. Liqui...|$|R
40|$|The biggest {{limitation}} {{to conventional}} gas chromatography (GC) is limited peak capacity, making {{the analysis of}} complex mixtures a difficult or even impossible task. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) significantly increases peak capacity and resolution, improves sensitivity and generates structured 3 D chromatograms. This is achieved by connecting two columns coated with different stationary phases through a special interface (modulator). The interface samples the first column effluent and periodically injects fractions of this material, as narrow injection pulses, onto the second column for further separation. Commercial instruments achieve this with <b>cryogenic</b> <b>agents.</b> Since this expensive approach permits only in-laboratory analysis, the development of simple, economical and field-capable GC×GC systems is in demand. This report summarizes the fundamentals governing GC×GC separations and {{a brief history of}} technological advances in the field. It also documents the construction of a simple interface, devoid of moving parts and cryogenic consumables, and hence highly suitable for field analysis and monitoring applications. Evaluation of the interface suggests on-par performance with more complicated cryogenic modulators. GC×GC separations of technical mixtures of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), common environmental pollutants (EPA 8270), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides (toxaphene), as well as selected essential oils and major distillation fractions of crude oil indicate very good performance. Most notably, the interface prototype was applied for the first ever time-resolved on-site analysis of the semivolatile organic fraction of urban air particulate matter (PM 2. 5) ...|$|R
40|$|Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are {{utilised}} in {{regenerative medicine}} {{due to their}} multilineage differentiation potential, ease of isolation, capacity for in vitro expansion and wide-spread availability in the adult tissues. Their therapeutic applications have been widely demonstrated. In order to facilitate their transition from a bench to bedside therapeutic, on-demand availability of cells is required. Cryopreservation is thus a crucial element in achieving this goal as it permits the long term stabilisation of biological cells. For successful cryopreservation, ultra-low temperatures are needed. However, uncontrolled elevated temperatures cannot be avoided in certain situations. The work presented in this thesis focuses on {{the investigation of the}} influence of temperature elevation on the cryopreservation of MSCs. This thesis comprises of three separate components. The first section examines the temperature variations of cryopreserved stem cells during transportation, using conventional solid CO 2 as the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>agent.</b> It was observed that significant temperature variations can occur using this method of transportation. The second study investigates the effects of temperature elevations of cryopreserved MSCs derived from rats. A multiple regression model composed of two exponentials is proposed to approximate the detrimental effects on cell viability. It demonstrates that temperature elevations have an imminent detrimental effect on cell viability. The topic is further elaborated in a subsequent study which uses human-derived MSCs as well as a larger sample set. In addition, an active learning sampling strategy in conjunction with Gaussian process data model is presented which attempts to maximise the information return from the experiments. This study demonstrates the existence of a 2 ̆ 7 lethal 2 ̆ 7 region causing the highest detrimental effect to cell viability...|$|E
40|$|Lactococcus lactis is a {{food-grade}} microorganism {{of major}} commercial importance. Antifreeze protein {{is a potent}} <b>cryogenic</b> protection <b>agent</b> for the cryopreservation of food and pharmaceutical materials. In this study, extracellular expression of a novel recombinant type 1 antifreeze protein analogue (rAFP) in L. lactis was optimized. An efficient SlpA promoter (P-SlpA) was fused to various signal peptides (SPs) and propeptide sequences to examine the extracellular expression levels of rAFP. An efficient signal peptide, SPsacB, fused to prosequence AE, enabled higher extracellular rAFP production; use of the S-lpA terminator (Ter(SlpA)) was a further improvement. The extracellularly expressed rAFP successfully inhibited ice recrystallization and is thus potentially applicable for cryogenic preservation...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a novel {{recombinant}} type I antifreeze protein analogue (rAFP) {{was produced}} and secreted by Lactococcus lactis, a food-grade microorganism of major commercial importance. Antifreeze proteins are potent <b>cryogenic</b> protection <b>agents</b> for the cryopreservation {{of food and}} pharmaceutical materials. A food-grade expression and fermentation system (BSE- and antibiotic-free) for the production and secretion of high levels of rAFP was developed. Lyophilized, crude rAFP produced by L. lactis was tested in a frozen meat and frozen dough processing model. The frozen meat treated with the antifreeze protein showed less drip loss, less protein loss, and a high score on juiciness by sensory evaluation. Frozen dough treated with the rAFP showed better fermentation capacity than untreated frozen dough. Breads baked from frozen dough treated with rAFP acquired the same consumer acceptance as fresh bread...|$|R
40|$|As verrugas genitais causadas pelo papilomavírus humano (HPV) são problemas comuns na prática clínica do coloproctologista. As opções terapêuticas são numerosas, não havendo padrão-ouro para o tratamento dos condilomas. Dentre elas, é possível destacar a crioterapia, que é eficaz, apesar de pouco utilizada. O efeito destrutivo da crioterapia ocorre por lesão celular direta, causada pelo frio, e por anóxia tecidual, consequente às alterações microcirculatórias. Dentre as vantagens do método, cita-se a segurança; a simplicidade de aplicação; o uso dentro e fora do canal anal, {{inclusive}} durante a gestação; e o desconforto local leve, dispensando anestesia. Os agentes criogênicos mais utilizados são o nitrogênio líquido e, mais recentemente, o dimetiléter-propano. Uma vantagem adicional é observada no tratamento das lesões neoplásicas e seus precursores. Postula-se que seu congelamento induziria à resposta imune antitumoral, consequente ao mecanismo de lesão tecidual, que expõe grande quantidade de antígenos intracelulares aos macrófagos e às células dendríticas. Entretanto, a literatura médica ainda carece de estudos abordando especificamente o tema, sobretudo na área da coloproctologia. De qualquer forma, podemos afirmar que a crioterapia é método eficaz, seguro, confortável e prático para o tratamento das verrugas anogenitais induzidas pelo HPV. Genital warts {{caused by}} human papillomavirus (HPV) {{are a common}} problem in clinical practice of colorectal surgeons. There are several therapeutic options, although, {{there is not a}} gold standard for the treatment of condilomas. Among them, we could mention cryotherapy, which is an effective method, despite having little use. The destructive effect of cryotherapy is through direct cellular injury, which is provoked by cold, and tissue anoxia, due microcirculatory changes. Among the method advantages, we could relate safety; simplicity of application; use inside and outside the anal canal, and during pregnancy; and mild local discomfort, not requiring anesthesia for its application. The most commonly used <b>cryogenic</b> <b>agents</b> are liquid nitrogen and more recently dimethylether-propane. An additional advantage is observed in the treatment of neoplasias and its precursors. It is postulated that freezing would induce an anti-tumor immune response, consequent to the mechanism of tissue injury, exposing a large amount of intracellular antigens to macrophages and dendritic cells. However, the literature still lacks studies specifically addressing this issue, especially in coloproctology. Anyway, we could say that cryotherapy is an effective, safe, comfortable, and practical method to treat anogenital warts induced by the HPV...|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} the art in launch systems uses {{chemical}} propulsion systems, primarily liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, to provide the energy necessary to achieve orbit and escape the bonds of Earth's gravity. In the future there may be other means available; however, currently few of these alternatives can compare to the speed or the ease of use provided by <b>cryogenic</b> chemical propulsion <b>agents.</b> <b>Cryogenics,</b> the science and art of producing cold operating conditions, has become increasingly important to our ability to travel within our solar system. The production and transport of cryogenic fuels as well as the long-term storage of these fluids are necessary for mankind to travel within our solar system. It is with great care and at a significant cost that gaseous compounds such as hydrogen and oxygen are liquified and become dense enough to use for rocket fuel. As our explorations move farther away from Earth, we need to address how to produce the necessary fuels to make a complete round-trip. The cost and the size of any expedition to another celestial body are extreme. If we are constrained by the need to take everything necessary (fuel, life support, etc.) for our survival and return, we greatly increase the risk of being able to go. As with the early explorers on Earth, we will need to harvest much of our energy and our life support from the celestial bodies. The in situ production of these energy sources is paramount to success. Due to the current propulsion system designs, the in-situ processes will require liquefaction and the application of cryogenics. The challenge we face for the near future is to increase our understanding of cryogenic long-term storage and off-world production of cryogenic fluids. We must do this all within the boundaries of very restricted size, weight, and robustness parameters so that we may launch these apparatus from Earth and utilize them elsewhere. Miniaturization, efficiency, and physically robust systems will all play a part in making space exploration possible; however, it is cryogenics that will enable all of this to occur...|$|R
