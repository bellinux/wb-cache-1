50|$|<b>Chiastolite</b> is {{a variety}} of the mineral {{andalusite}} with the chemical composition Al2SiO5. It is noted for distinctive cross-shaped black inclusions of graphite. In areas around Georgetown, California, metamorphosed sediments contained andalusite and <b>chiastolite</b> in a graphite rich metasediment. The <b>chiastolite</b> crystals have been pseudomorphically altered by a mixture of muscovite, paragonite and margarite. The calcium rich margarite tends to form along the graphite rich crosses or bands within the <b>chiastolite.</b> Mineralogically the occurrence is important because all three white mica phases are present in an equilibrium assemblage.|$|E
50|$|It occurs {{commonly}} as an alteration {{product of}} corundum, andalusite and other aluminous minerals. It {{has been reported}} as forming alteration pseudomorphs of <b>chiastolite</b> along with muscovite and paragonite. The margarite in this occurrence forms preferentially along the dark graphite rich inclusions with the <b>chiastolite</b> crystals.|$|E

50|$|There {{are basic}} {{intrusive}} rocks {{that have been}} identified as dolerites https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di%C3%A1base and which occur in the form of veins 0.5 to 3m thick, with an orientation predominantly N-S and vertical inclination. They are dark grey, fine grain and micro-porphyritic, being altered in the contact with the mineralized veins. They present irregular fractures and polyhedral disjunction. Mineralogically they are essentially formed by labradorite, hornblenda, chlorite Chlorite group and amphibolitized pyroxene. They do not affect the mineralization and are intersected by the hydrothermal vein system. These dykes follow the two phases of deformation. In the eastern zone of Couto Mineiro, there are spotted schist with spots of biotite and chlorite, and less frequently of <b>chiastolite</b> <b>Chiastolite</b> and cordierite Cordierite corresponding to a contact metamorphism halo, which was considered as an indication of the presence of an intrusion of an in-depth magmatic body.|$|E

It {{is one of several}} types of trapiche or trapiche-like minerals, which also include trapiche ruby, sapphire, garnet, <b>chiastolite</b> and tourmaline. The name comes from the Spanish term trapiche, a sugar mill, because of the resemblance of the pattern to the spokes of a grinding wheel.|$|E

50|$|Like fleckschiefer, fruchtschiefer and garbenschiefer, knotenschiefer is {{a variety}} of contact {{metamorphic}} slate. It is formed at temperatures of around 400 °C and its dark coloration is caused by graphite. Fruchtschiefer occurs at 500 °C. Knotenschiefer is characterised by small nodules, up to one centimetre in size, and nodular deposits of mica {{as a result of}} the growth in grain size during metamorphism. The nodules consist of iron minerals, carbon substances and mica; as the metamorphic temperature rises, minerals such as andalusite or <b>chiastolite</b> increasingly occur.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} regarding {{the formation of}} the <b>chiastolite</b> cross, however the most widely accepted theory, proposed by Frondel in 1934, suggests that there is a selective attachment of impurities at the rapidly growing corners of andalusite crystals. As the concentration of these impurities (which consist primarily of graphite) increases, the growth of the crystal is slowed. This concentrated impurity deposit forms a re-entrant as it is absorbed by the growth of the andalusite porphyroblast. The cycle of growth-retardation-growth then repeats itself, creating a featherlike pattern of graphite along four radiating 'arms'.|$|E
50|$|Slates, shales and clays yield biotite {{hornfels}} {{in which}} the most conspicuous mineral is biotite mica, the small scales of which are transparent under the microscope and have a dark reddish-brown color and strong dichroism. There is also quartz, and often {{a considerable amount of}} feldspar, while graphite, tourmaline and iron oxides frequently occur in lesser quantity. In these biotite hornfels the minerals, which consist of aluminiun silicates, are commonly found; they are usually andalusite and sillimanite, but kyanite appears also in hornfels, especially in those that have a schistose character. The andalusite may be pink and is then often pleochroic in thin sections, or it may be white with the cross-shaped dark enclosures of the matrix that are characteristic of <b>chiastolite.</b> Sillimanite usually forms exceedingly minute needles embedded in quartz.|$|E
5000|$|Tosham Hill: The main Tusham hill is {{the second}} largest hill in the range. It has ancient rock {{inscriptions}} and rock pantings, paelo eroded rocky glacial channels and water cascades, and small hilltop lakes. It consists of a quartz porphyry ring dyke, felsite, welded tuff and muscovite biotite granite. The country rocks (Archean Bhilwara basement rocks) native to the area are quartzite with <b>chiastolite</b> belonging to the Delhi Supergroup. The Tosham Sn-W-Cu rocks {{are the source of}} primary tin as well as Tungsten and copper, but found to be not viable commercially. The granites and granite porphyries are high heat producing type. Spectroscopy studies indicate that they have high abundance of potassium (K), uranium (U), and thorium (Th), a sign of radioactivity. Highest heat flow in India is recorded from this area.|$|E
50|$|By {{recrystallization}} in {{this manner}} peculiar rocks of very distinct types are often produced. Thus shales may pass into cordierite rocks, or may show large crystals of andalusite (and <b>chiastolite),</b> staurolite, garnet, kyanite and sillimanite, all derived from the aluminous content of the original shale. A considerable amount of mica (both muscovite and biotite) is often simultaneously formed, and the resulting product has a close resemblance to many kinds of schist. Limestones, if pure, are often turned into coarsely crystalline marbles; {{but if there was}} an admixtureof clay or sand in the original rock such minerals as garnet, epidote, idocrase, wollastonite, will be present. Sandstones when greatly heated may change into coarse quartzites composed of large clear grains of quartz. These more intense stages of alteration are notso commonly seen in igneous rocks, because their minerals, being formed at high temperatures, are not so easily transformed or recrystallized.|$|E
50|$|On {{account of}} the minuteness with which it has been {{described}} and the important controversies on points of theoretical geology which have arisen regarding it, the granulite district of Saxony (in the area of Rosswein and Penig) in Germany may be considered the typical region for rocks of this group. It should be remembered that though granulites are probably the commonest rocks of this country, they are mingled with granites, gneisses, gabbros, amphibolites, mica schists and many other petrographical types. All of these rocks show more-or-less metamorphism either of a thermal character or due to pressure and crushing. The granites pass into gneiss and granulite; the gabbros into flaser gabbro and amphibolite; the slates often contain andalusite or <b>chiastolite,</b> and show transitions to mica schists. At one time these rocks were regarded as Archean gneisses of a special type. Johannes Georg Lehmann propounded the hypothesis that their present state was due principally to crushingacting on them in a solid condition, grinding them down and breaking up their minerals, while the pressure {{to which they were}} subjected welded them together into coherent rock. It is now believed, however, that they are comparatively recent and include sedimentary rocks, partly of Palaeozoic age, and intrusive masses which may be nearly massive or may have gneissose, flaser or granulitic structures. These have been developed largely by the injection of semi-consolidated highly viscous intrusions, and the varieties of texture are original or were produced very shortly after the crystallization of the rocks. Meanwhile, however, Lehmanns advocacy of post-consolidation crushing as a factor in the development of granulites has been so successful that the terms granulitization and granulitic structures are widely employed to indicate the results of dynamometamorphism acting on rocks at a period long after their solidification.|$|E
40|$|There is an {{association}} between the development of cleavage domes, a texture reflecting the displacement of insoluble matrix grains by porphyroblasts growing under a bulk hydrostatic stress, and textural sector-zoning. This {{has been found in}} garnet, staurolite, <b>chiastolite,</b> pyrite and possibly emerald porphyroblasts. Sector-zoned porphyroblasts form by lineage growth normal to the crystal faces. This causes everal distinctive textures (type 1 inclusions and type 2 intergrowths, inclusion bands, growth prongs), all of which are directly or indirectly related to displacement growth.

40|$|The <b>chiastolite</b> {{variety of}} {{andalusite}} contains a cross of inclusions of quartz and graphite in sections through prismatic porphyroblasts parallel to (001). The cross is always accompanied by roughly 5 μm diameter rod-shaped quartz inclusions that formed by co-precipitation of andalusite and quartz during growth, a process {{similar to one}} described by Burton (1986) to explain garnet-quartz intergrowths in regional metamorphic rocks. The metamorphic fluid consisted of a mixture of H 2 O, CO 2 and minor amounts of other gases produced by internal buffering by graphite, which was always present during crystal growth. <b>Chiastolite</b> porphyroblasts grew alongside sector zoned garnets like Burton's during contact metamorphism of the Zhoukoudian aureole, Beijing, China. Crystal growth accompanied by deformation gave rise to curved quartz rods, sometimes alongside curved cracks that are not exactly parallel to cleavage. Individual porphyroblasts had multi-stage growth histories during deformation accompanied by removal of large volumes of Si in solution from the matrix. The resulting loss of volume and mechanical weakening of country rocks facilitated emplacement of the Zhoukoudian intrusive complex by ballooning. © 2010 International Association for Gondwana Research...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Metapelitic rocks {{from the}} Marble Hall Fragment, {{enclosed}} in the granites of the magmatic Bushveld Complex, record a two-stage, low-pressure, high-temperature metamorphism. An early paragenesis containing chiastolitic andalusite, cordierite, biotite and quartz¡garnet crystallized in most rocks and equilibrated at 550 – 600 uC, 0. 2 GPa. It was transformed during the second, peak event into various parageneses that commonly coexist {{within a single}} thin section. These include garnet–cordierite–biotite– K-feldspar–quartz, sillimanite–cordierite–K-feldspar–quartz and spectacular quartz-undersaturated cordierite–spinel symplectites replacing the <b>chiastolite</b> porphyroblasts. Based on a detailed phase diagram analysis, we argue that these parageneses result from rapid heating at an approximately constant pressure to temperatures of more than about 720 uC. At these temperatures, the internally buffered activity of water was reduced by incipient water-saturated partial melting, while only minor quantities of melt were produced. Subsequent dry conditions inhibited large-scale equilibration and, together with local inhomogeneities in mineral distribution, {{led to the development}} of contrasting parageneses and symplectite textures. No signs of widespread fluid-absent melting of biotite were found, and so the temperature probably did not exceed 760 uC. The peak metamorphic event is attributed to the emplacement of the hot Nebo granite, whereas the early metamorphism was probably caused by the intrusion of one of the phases of the Rustenburg Layered Suite. We infer the conditions of development of the cordierite–spinel intergrowths and we show that, although symplectites are commonly associated with retrograde processes (cooling and/or decompression), they can record a prograde metamorphic evolution. Furthermore, our contribution emphasizes the importance of the concept of reduced equilibration volume for the understanding and interpretation of some particular textures and parageneses in common rocks...|$|E
40|$|The Ramanujganj area {{in eastern}} India exposes a Proterozoic {{metasedimentary}} belt (similar to 35 km x 18 km) {{which has been}} mapped in detail in terms of two pelitic and two psammitic lithounits. Dominant rock types in the belt include porphyroblastic argillite, phyllite and pelitic schist, feldspathic quartzite and orthoquartzite. The belt has an elongated oval shape with broadly NW-SE trend. Folds of three generations (F- 1, F- 2 and F- 3) have been recorded. F- 1 folds are rarely preserved as small isoclinal folds on bedding (S- 0) associated with an axial planar cleavage (S- 1). F- 2 folds involve transposed S- 0 + S- 1 surfaces and vary from open to isoclinal, with steeply inclined axial plane and moderate plunge. Several large scale F- 2 closures with NW to NNW striking axial planes are exposed. F- 3 folds are steeply inclined to upright in nature with NE striking axial planes. Large scale F- 3 folds are usually broad warps. Interference patterns of dome and basin type and hook type are observed in the area. F- 1 and F- 2 folds are broadly coaxial in nature, and their superposition has resulted in hook shaped pattern. F- 2 and F- 3 folds have superposed to produce dome-and-basin structures on both outcrop scale and large scale. The regional structure of the area is an elongate basin resulting mainly from the interference of F- 3 folds on F- 2 structures. The western and northern parts of the area are occupied by biotite quartzofeldspathic orthogneiss which intruded during or before F- 1 deformation. In the eastern part mesocratic granodiorite intruded after F, deformation and before or during F- 2 deformation. The Ramanujganj pelites are commonly characterised by large porphyroblasts of andalusite (<b>chiastolite),</b> whereas biotite and garnet form relatively small porphyroblasts. Andalusite occurs in the southeastern and central parts of the area, and transforms to sillimanite as we go towards northwest. This indicates increasing grade of metamorphism from southeast towards northwest: The metamorphism is of low pressure type...|$|E
