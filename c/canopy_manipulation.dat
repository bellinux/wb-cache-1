40|$|A pruning {{trial was}} {{established}} to investigate the effect of <b>canopy</b> <b>manipulation</b> on growth and yield of mangosteen under field conditions at The-Pha research station, Songkhla province. Forty 7 -year-oldmangosteen trees were used and the study designed as randomized complete blocks with 4 treatments in 10 replicates. The treatments were as follows: 1. control or no-pruning (T 1), 2. cutting upper one along one sideof each tier of branches along the main stem (T 2), 3. cutting one tier of branches with the upper tier along the main stem remaining (T 3) and 4. top-cutting at 3 -meter plant height (T 4). It was found that 1 year afterpruning, the trees in T 2 exhibited highest relative plant height and longest branch length after pruning (6. 63 m / 4 month and 35. 31 cm / 4 month, respectively). First-year bearing was found only in T 1 and T 4, and the fruit yields in T 1 and T 4 were (3. 13 and 2. 31 kg/tree, respectively). It was remarkable that light transmissionthrough plant canopy in T 4 gave the highest photosynthetically active radiation PAR (48. 55 %), but T 1 the lowest PAR (2. 46 %). Thus, the plant growth in T 4 was greater than in T 1, and the mangosteen trees in T 4 also exhibited high root proliferation.

40|$|Early {{work has}} shown {{variation}} in the grain yield of rice cultivars grown under water stress conditions {{to be associated with}} the plant water status, mainly with the maintenance of high leaf water potential (LWP) at flowering and grain filling stage. Considerable variation for LWP among rice varieties has been recorded. The present work was designed to investigate genotypic consistency in water potential within the plant and under <b>canopy</b> <b>manipulation</b> to vary plant water requirement. In a glasshouse experiment, with six rice genotypes, a consistent water potential gradient from stem base to leaf tip has been observed. Leaf tip water potential has been found as the minimum LWP that can be recorded at any time of stress. Genotypes with similar canopy size could maintain different levels of LWP under stress conditions. In a field experiment, with four selected lines, four canopy sizes and two canopy mixture treatments were introduced prior to the imposition of control, mild and severe water stress conditions. It was found that the line differences in LWP and relative water content (RWC) were expressed under both mild and severe stress conditions, regardless of canopy size, tiller number and whether they were mixed with another line with different capacity to maintain LWP. Although there were some differences among canopy size treatments for radiation interception in three water conditions, <b>canopy</b> <b>manipulation</b> (plant size) within a line did not affect the expression of LWP and hence genotypic variation in LWP was maintained. Under both glasshouse and field conditions, lines that maintained high LWP had larger xylem diameter and stem areas than those that had low LWP. The results indicated that the size of the vascular bundles could influence the maintenance of plant water relations under water deficit. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Sixteen of 22 -year-old, uniformly sized mangosteen tress were used. Water use of the mangosteen trees was determined during 3 stages: 1) fruit setting, 2) fruit development and 3) fruit ripening. Results showed that significant differences in water use among treatments occurred {{during the period of}} fruit-setting and fruit development. During the fruit-setting period, the mangosteen trees in treatment 4 exhibited significantly higher water use (88. 96 l d - 1) compared to the ramaining treatments of control (64. 63 l d - 1), treatment 2 (60. 47 l d - 1), and treatment 3 (42. 24 l d - 1). In the fruit development period, significantly higher water use was also found in treatment 4 (90. 49 l d - 1), while {{there was no significant difference}} among the treatments of control (64. 64 l d - 1), treatment 2 (63. 90 l d - 1) and treatment 3 (45. 24 l d - 1) Fruit yields of all treatments were recorded in 1994 and 1995. There was no significant difference in fruit yield in 1994.

Recent work involving <b>canopy</b> <b>manipulations</b> has demonstrated that disturbance to the native algal canopy facilitates establishment of U. pinnatifida sporophytes at high densities, however, the kelp's response to a natural disruption of the native algal canopy has not been assessed. In summer/autumn 2001, we examined the response of U. pinnatifida to the significant dieback of a common native canopy forming macroalga (Phyllospora comosa) {{on the east coast}} of Tasmania. The response of U. pinnatifida and native algae to the dieback was observed during the season for growth of U. pinnatifida sporophytes (spring 2001) and compared with adjacent areas where dieback did not occur. Undaria pinnatifida sporophytes established at high densities (6. 75 +/- 1. 99 stipes m- 2) in dieback areas, but remained rare or entirely absent in control areas where the native canopy was intact. The dieback also resulted in bleaching of encrusting algae and increased cover of understorey algae and sediment.

Longevity of experimental seed cohorts differed markedly among species, from 1 yr (Stryphnodendron). Similarly, germination of recently dispersed seeds in the understorey ranged from 0 % in Laetia to > 75 % in Cordia and Vochysia. In contrast, seedling survival was uniformly low (< 10 % survival one year after transplanting except for Stryphnodendron, which showed ~ 20 % survival). Implications of these findings {{for the management of}} secondary forest stands for timber production vary. All the species require nearly complete canopy opening to regenerate. Some species germinate well in the shade and can be managed at the seedlings stage by opening up the canopy a few months after germination (e. g., Cordia, Simarouba, Vochysia). Species showing little or no germination under closed canopy (e. g., Jacaranda, Laetia, Rollinia) need canopy removal to germinate adequately. Any <b>canopy</b> <b>manipulation</b> must be performed within 6 months. Site preparation may be necessary to control herbs and shrubs.

40|$|In {{southern}} Australia a {{large proportion}} of crop nitrogen requirements are usually applied early in the season, either just before or at sowing, or during the first 6 - 8 weeks after sowing. However, the time of greatest demand for nitrogen by wheat crops is during the stem-elongation phase when the crop is growing fastest, while early demand for nitrogen is small. The study utilised two field sites in South Australia (Hart and Mintaro) over two seasons (2003 - 04) to examine the effect of delayed applications of nitrogen fertiliser on nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) to dryland wheat. Treatments were applied to manipulate the crop canopy and to measure the balance between canopy size and structure and crop nitrogen uptake. In both seasons and sites significant (P< 0. 05) grain yield increases were obtained by later nitrogen application times. Grain protein also increases with rate of applied nitrogen and delayed time of application, with the 1 st node (GS 31) treatment generally producing the highest values. Applying higher rates of nitrogen fertiliser reduced NUE, while later applications were able to increase NUE. <b>Canopy</b> <b>manipulation</b> was able to increase crop nitrogen uptake, coinciding with improved grain yield formation. Generally, the data suggest that the nitrogen taken up later in the season is used very efficiently by the crop.

"December 2012 "The initial juvenile movement phase represents the first stage of the multi-phase process of natal dispersal. My objective was to investigate how alterations in forest habitat quality impact initial juvenile movement success and behavior. I conducted a mark-recapture study of juvenile Spotted Salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and Green Frogs (Lithobates clamitans) within experimental forest arrays. Spotted Salamander movement success was significantly greater in partial-cut treatments than the control or clearcut treatments. Green Frog movement success was greatest in the control forest. A greater proportion of both Spotted Salamander and Green Frog juveniles, initially moving through open-canopy habitats, redirected their movements toward forests. I next sought to identify how fine-scale habitat quality affects juveniles' decisions to cease moving away from their natal pond and settle. By using experimental enclosures, I attempted to isolate the effects of forest <b>canopy</b> and microhabitat <b>manipulations</b> on salamander settling decisions relative to unmanipulated forest controls.

However, under temperatures below or over the optimum for cotton production the effect of mepiquat chloride (MC) {{has not always been}} significant. In this experiment, cotton plants were grown in growth chambers to study the response to MC as affected by temperature and to determine if an increase in dose could overcome the temperature effects. Mepiquat chloride was applied at rates of 0, 15 and 30 g ai ha- 1 at the pinhead square stage. Plants were then grown under three temperature regimes: 25 / 15 °C, 32 / 22 °C, and 39 / 29 °C (day/night temperatures) for 51 days. Higher temperatures increased plant height, reproductive branches, fruit number, fruit abscission, and photosynthesis per unit area, but decreased leaf area and chlorophyll. The largest effect of MC on plant height was observed when the daily temperature was 32 °C, with nights of 22 °C, which was also best for plant growth. High temperatures not only decreased the effectiveness of MC on plant height control, but also caused lower dry matter and fruit number per plant. Low temperatures (25 / 15 ºC) decreased cotton growth and fruit retention, but a higher concentration of MC was required per unit of growth reduction as compared with 32 / 22 ºC. At high temperatures, the rate of MC to be applied must be disproportionately increased, because either plant growth is impaired by high temperature lessening the effect of MC, or degradation of MC within the plant is too rapid...|$|E

The concentration and stable carbon isotope composition of CO 2 were determined using the gas chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses. The δ 13 C -CO 2 of the soil fluxes decreased over sampling time for the ‘dry-warm’ conditions and <b>canopy</b> <b>manipulation.</b> The ecosystem-derived δ 13 C -CO 2 values (corrected for the atmospheric δ 13 C -CO 2) which included predominately soil-and rhizosphere respiration were – 26. 2 ± 0. 8 ‰ for the ‘dry-warm’ conditions and decreased down to – 28. 1 ± 1. 4 ‰ {{over a period of}} 28 days from late August to the end of September.

40|$|In several winegrowing {{regions of}} the world, climate change has {{determined}} an acceleration of the ripening process, resulting in increased sugar concentration at harvest and in wines characterized by high alcohol levels, low acidity and reduced varietal aroma. The limitation of photosynthetic carbon availability by drastically reducing canopy size, has been proposed as a strategy to reduce berry sugar at harvest. However, in some cases, this strategy has negatively impacted other fruit composition parameters (e. g. anthocyanins). Our research investigated the effect of <b>canopy</b> <b>manipulation</b> on sugars and phenolic accumulation in the berries of grapevines subjected to different irrigation regimes. The trial was conducted at the experimental station of the University of Udine (Udine, Italy) on 28 -years-old ‘Merlot’ grapevines grafted on SO 4 in 2011 and 2012. We tested {{the effect of a}} severe post-veraison canopy reduction (- 50 % of total leaf area) in combination with deficit irrigation to reduce sugar concentration and enhance phenolic concentration in the berries at harvest. Four treatments were tested: 1) Canopy reduction under deficit irrigation (CR-WD), 2) Canopy reduction under full irrigation (CR-I), 3) No canopy reduction under deficit irrigation (C-WD), and 4) No canopy reduction under full irrigation (C-I). In 2011, CR-WD treatment resulted in berries with lower sugar concentration and higher anthocyanin concentration than the other treatments. Canopy reduction was also efficient in reducing sugar without altering anthocyanin concentration under well-watered conditions. In 2012, however, canopy reduction did not reduce sugar concentration at harvest. Our data suggests that modifying the source-sink balance via canopy reduction is a viable practice for modulating sugar accumulation only when the leaf area/crop weight ratio is a limiting factor. Seasonal weather variability may overcome the targeted ratio by compensating fruit size and/or yield and canopy reduction should be managed accordingly...|$|E

Native plant {{agroforestry}} enrichment systems {{established in}} already degraded or altered environments {{have the potential}} to protect existing native habitat and provide plant material for cultural purposes while potentially favoring the reestablishment of other non-target native species. Limited information is available on the survival and growth of native Hawaiian plants planted in the understory of secondary forests dominated by nonnative species. This study investigated an understory agroforestry system that utilized native plants with both economic and cultural value and was designed to provide desired plant material while also complementing restoration activities with the removal of invasive species. Research objectives were: 1) Measure establishment and growth response of three native species planted in removed or intact nonnative understory and determine to what extent light availability, soil moisture and nutrient availability influenced these responses; 2) evaluate the effects of understory nonnative species removal, particularly the dominant invasive species Ardisia elliptica, and the planting of native species on nonnative and native seedling recruitment; and 3) examine the photosynthetic light-response and functional differences of the native fern, Microlepia strigosa, planted in the two understory treatments. Results of this research suggest that within lowland wet mesic forests dominated by nonnative species, light availability is the most critical resource limiting establishment and growth of understory native species. Successful and sustainable cultivation of these native species will require some level of <b>canopy</b> opening or <b>manipulation</b> to ensure adequate light levels. The relatively high survival of M. strigosa under varying understory light conditions suggests it is a good species for establishing an understory groundcover. Additionally, M. strigosa shows increases in photosynthetic capacity when planted within removed understory, but is photosynthetically limited to relatively low light and shaded environments. Results from this research also indicate that established native plantings may provide some resource competition for nonnative species but manipulation of environmental resources, such as decreasing available light, plus continued weeding is more effective at reducing nonnative species recruitment. Consequently, management for a more homogenous nonnative canopy cover can provide more uniform reductions in light transmittance to the understory and limit nonnative seedling recruitment...|$|R
40|$|Kabuli {{chickpea}} (Cicer arietinum L.) has two leaf types, the fern and unifoliate. Yield {{potential is}} limited for kabuli chickpea in Saskatchewan. It {{is limited by}} a short-season, a semi-arid environment, and end-of-season rainfall. Manipulating plant population, and choosing chickpea cultivars with the best leaf type for biomass production, radiation interception and yield for the early, middle, or late growth season, may increase chickpea yield. Therefore, the objectives of this study were: to (i) determine the relationship between leaf type and key growth parameters of six chickpea cultivars varying in leaf morphology at moderate and high plant population densities; (&# 1110;&# 1110;) to characterize {{the reaction of the}} fern and unifoliate leaf to altered canopy light environments. Different light environments were created by 50 % defoliation at vegetative growth, first flower, and 50 % shading from vegetative growth to first flower, as well as two light enrichment treatments initiated at the first flower and pod formation stages. Fern leaf cultivars exhibited higher maximum light interception, seasonal cumulative intercepted radiation and a higher harvest index compared to unifoliate leaf cultivars. However, both leaf type canopies had less than 95 % light interception for most of the season. The fern and unifoliate leaf type contributed to similar radiation use efficiency in three out of four location-years. In addition, fern leaf cultivars produced significantly higher seed yield than cultivars with unifoliate leaves. Plant density influenced growth parameters. For example, the 45 plants m- 2 treatment had a higher harvest index than the 85 plants m- 2 treatment, in two location-years, while both population treatments were similar in the other two location-years. Yield of chickpea was increased by higher plant population in only one location-year, but was not significantly affected by plant population in the other location-years. The effect of <b>canopy</b> light environment <b>manipulation</b> on chickpea yield depended on the stages of plant development when they were applied. Defoliation at vegetative growth and first flower had no effect on yield. However, plants responded significantly to the 50 % shade treatment; the crop growth rate, harvest index and yield were less in the shaded treatment compared to the control. Shading also increased plant height. Light enrichment treatments increased the yield. However, the degree of yield increase was greater when light enrichment occurred at first flower, than at the later stage of pod formation. These results highlighted the importance of the amount of irradiance during the flowering stage. It was concluded that chickpea breeders should select lines with fern leaves for improved radiation interception when breeding cultivars for semiarid short-season environments such as in Saskatchewan. Management and breeding practices should ensure that the crop can make efficient use of the solar radiation at flowering to maximize yield. Improvement at the canopy and subsequent yield level is yet to be made in Saskatchewan environments by increased light interception, increased growth before flowering, and increased and stable harvest index...|$|R
40|$|A {{greenhouse}} crop can be approached as an open {{system that can}} be affected {{by a number of}} parameters such as light, climate or nutrient supply. In the last decades efforts have been made to understand the functioning of this system and the interaction between the different parameters. The intensive nature of greenhouse cultivation combined with the economic necessity to enlarge the farm size makes the development of decision support systems (DSS) imperative to help the growers in managing their farms efficiently. The foundation of DSS are plant models and in order to work more efficiently {{they should be able to}} receive information in real time from sensors that measure different plant parameters such as light interception, leaf area index and photosynthetic stress in a non-destructive way. In order to develop functional DSS it is imperative to develop accurate models and monitoring techniques applied in the specific greenhouse environment. The aim of this thesis was to explore different techniques to simulate and monitor light interception and photosynthesis by a greenhouse grown tomato canopy. Since photosynthesis is directly linked to light absorption we opted to develop a three dimensional model that takes into account the explicit plant architecture. Different methodologies to monitor these physiological properties online by means of remote sensing were also explored. A number of physiological tomato models have been proposed the last decades, their main challenge being the correct simulation of fruit yield. For this, an accurate simulation of light interception, and thus photosynthesis, is of primary importance. At present most process-based models and the majority of three dimensional models, include simplifications of plant architecture that can compromise the accuracy of light interception simulations and, accordingly, canopy photosynthesis. In Chapter 2. 1 the first steps towards the development of the model are presented. Light interception is highly dependent on the canopy structure, which is affected, among others, by the distance between plant rows, the distance of plants within the row, leaf pruning and crop variety. The model was used to test different crop planting scenarios on their effect on light interception. Light interception from the planting scenarios was then compared with results of a totally homogeneous canopy. Also analysis of differences between manual measurements of leaf length, width, elevation angle and leaf orientation was conducted. Changes of leaf elevation angles at two different times of the day were also measured. In tomato differences in leaf length, width and elevation angle of the leaves were mainly observed in the upper 90 cm of the plant, in the still developing zone. Changes of the architectural characteristics of structural plant characteristics affected directly light interception by the crop canopy. Nevertheless even if plant structure stayed the same, light penetration could easily be manipulated by changing the row spacing in the crop, thus affecting light interception and potentially plant production. In Chapter 2. 2 the development and calibration of a functional-structural tomato model is fully described. The model was used to investigate the canopy heterogeneity of an explicitly described tomato canopy in relation to temporal dynamics of horizontal and vertical light distribution and photosynthesis under direct and diffuse light conditions. The model consists of an architectural static virtual plant coupled with a nested radiosity model for light absorption and a leaf photosynthesis module. Different scenarios for horizontal and vertical distributions of light interception, incident light and photosynthesis were investigated under diffuse and direct light conditions. Simulated light interception showed a good correspondence to the measured values. Explicitly described leaf elevation angles resulted in higher light interception in the middle of the plant canopy compared to fixed and ellipsoidal leaf elevation angle distribution models, although the total light interception remained the same. The fraction of light intercepted at a north-south orientation of rows differed from an east-west orientation by 10 % in winter and 23 % on summer days. The horizontal distribution of photosynthesis differed significantly between the top, middle and lower canopy layer. Taking into account the vertical variation of leaf photosynthetic parameters in the canopy, led to ca. 8 % increase on simulated <b>canopy</b> photosynthesis. <b>Manipulation</b> of plant structure can strongly affect light distribution in the canopy and photosynthesis. In Chapter 2. 3 the idea of identifying different plant ideotypes for optimization of light absorption and photosynthesis was explored. Using the functional-structural tomato model presented in the previous chapters, a range of different plant architectural characteristics were tested for two different seasons in order to find the optimal architecture with respect to light absorption and photosynthesis. Sensitivity analyses were carried out for leaf elevation angle, leaf phyllotaxis, leaflet angle, leaf shape, leaflet arrangement and internode length. From the results of this analysis two possible ideotypes were proposed. Increasing light absorption in the top part of the canopy by 25 %, without changing light absorption of the canopy as a whole, augmented photosynthesis by 6 % in winter and decreased it by 7 % in summer. The measured plant structure was already optimal with respect to leaf elevation angle, leaflet angle and leaflet arrangement for both light absorption and photosynthesis while phyllotaxis had no effect. Increasing the length-to-width ratio of leaves by 1. 5 or increasing internode length from 7 to 12 cm led to an increase of 7 – 10 % for light absorption and photosynthesis. The most important architectural traits found were the internode length and the leaf shape as they affect vertical light distribution in the canopy distinctly. A new plant ideotype with more spacious canopy architecture due to long internodes and long and narrow leaves led to an increase in photosynthesis of up to 10 %. In Chapter 3. 1 ways to monitor on-line LAI and PAR interception of the canopy, under greenhouse conditions, through reflectance measurements, were explored. LAI and PAR interception were measured at the same moments as reflectance at six wavelengths in different developmental stages of tomato and sweet pepper plants. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated. Relationships between the measured parameters were established in experimental greenhouses and subsequently these were tested in commercial greenhouses. The best estimation for LAI and PAR interception was obtained from reflectance at 460 nm for both tomato and sweet pepper. The goodness of the fit was validated with data from the commercial greenhouses and was also tested in this study. The divergence of the results from the ones reported from field experiments can be traced back to the special greenhouse environment, where more sources of reflectance are added due to construction parts and a white plastic covered background. Reflectance measurements offer a non- destructive way to estimate PAR interception and LAI (up to the value of 3) in greenhouse production systems. The relationship established between reflectance at 460 nm, PAR interception and LAI for both tomato and sweet pepper, can become a good tool for crop online monitoring in greenhouse conditions. Furthermore if information from reflectance sensors is used as input directly into the crop models, new opportunities for decision support systems in greenhouse production could be opened up. Photosynthetic stress induced by water deprivation in plants affects a number of physiological processes such as photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance as well as the operating efficiency of PSII and non- photochemical quenching. Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) is reported to be sensitive to changes of xanthophyll cycle that occur during stress and could possibly be used to monitor changes in the physiological parameters mentioned before. In Chapter 3. 2 the use of PRI as an early photosynthetic stress indicator was evaluated. A water stress treatment was imposed on a greenhouse tomato crop. CO 2 assimilation, stomatal conductance, light and dark adapted fluorescence as well as PRI and relative water content of the rooting medium RWCs% where repeatedly measured. The same measurements were also performed on well-irrigated plants that acted as a reference. The experiment was repeated in four consecutive weeks. Results showed that PRI can be used as an early stress indicator only when light intensity at crop level was above 700 μmol m- 2 s- 1. At lower values of light intensity the relationship of PRI to RWCs% was poor in comparison to photosynthesis or fluorescence parameters that showed a high correlation to RWCs%. For that reason we can conclude that PRI as water stress indicator cannot be independent of the ambient light conditions and its use can make sense only under conditions of high light. Finally in Chapter 4 the main achievements and limitations of this study are discussed and directions for future research are proposed.  ...|$|R

These treatments were applied to individual, mature Prunus avium trees in an orchard in the South East of England. Despite rapid recovery of canopy LA within the crown-reduced trees, both treatments significantly reduced the water use of individual wild cherry trees during the first season following application, with crown-reduction having the greatest effect. Crown-thinning increased daily water use per unit LA, while crown-reduction decreased water use per unit when compared to that of the control trees. These differences in water use per unit LA and whole tree water use related well to the contrasting influence of the treatments on canopy architecture and rates of canopy regrowth. Boundary layer conductance (g b) and leaf irradiance were constantly lower within the crown-reduced trees and higher in the crown-thinned trees, when compared to control values. Differences in leaf level physiology were also observed as a result of <b>canopy</b> <b>manipulation,</b> with crown-reduced trees having the highest rates of assimilation (A) and stomatal conductance (g s) in the first year after manipulation. This difference was possibly the result of a smaller shoot:root ratio (S:R). These physiological differences resulted in the crown-reduced trees having a higher discrimination against the heavier 13 C (Δ 13 C), traditionally implying low water use efficiency (WUE). However, measurements of the δ 18 O of leaf water and whole tree sap flux indicated that this treatment had a lower water use than either the crown-thinned or control trees.

40|$|Repeat {{purchase}} of kiwifruit is primarily driven by consumer judgement of internal fruit quality attributes, including those affected by dry matter concentration (DMC) and mineral composition in fruit. This research investigated mechanisms affecting carbohydrate, mineral and water accumulation in 'Hayward' kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa), and related these to specific management practices. <b>Canopy</b> <b>manipulation</b> through pruning and treatments such as artificial pollination, defoliation, girdling, thinning {{and application of}} the auxin transport inhibitor TIBA, may affect fruit DMC and mineral composition. Leaf photosynthesis and fruit dry matter concentrations (DMC) started to decline as leaf area index values increased above 3 - 4. In addition to reducing competition for carbohydrates between vegetative and reproductive growth, leader pruning probably increased DMCs of fruit in the leader zone by improving light interception. Photosynthesis was not affected by crop loads between 20 - 60 fruit m- 2, but was consistently higher on non-terminating (long) shoots than on terminating (short) shoots, as were fruit DMCs. Differences in photosynthetic rate of leaves on these two shoot types were attributed to differences in shoot exposure to the sun, and also to the greater demand for carbohydrate within long shoots. Leaves subtending fruit may increase Ca, {{and to a lesser}} extent Mg, flow into fruit, however their accumulation was not affected by leaves outside the fruiting shoot. Xylem sap Ca and Mg concentrations were higher in shoots with a high rather than a low leaf: fruit (L:F) ratio and this may, at least partially, relate to the increase in shoot transpiration that occurs as shoot L:F ratios increase. Within vine variation in fruit Ca concentrations may reflect variations in xylem sap flow rates and Ca concentrations of xylem sap reaching fruit. Calcium translocation may occur independently of ion movement in the transpiration stream. Timing and extent of vascular differentiation in flower and fruitlet pedicels, possibly regulated by auxin, may influence fruit Ca accumulation. It is likely that early differentiation of vascular tissue in flower and fruitlet pedicels influenced cell division and subsequent (carbohydrate) sink strength of fruit by determining availability of carbohydrate for partitioning into cell walls. While growers have the potential to induce minor changes in fruit DMC, further increases will depend on the separation of carbohydrate and water accumulation. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms regulating phloem transport and unloading of sucrose in kiwifruit...|$|E

Traditionally drought sensitive varieties {{have the potential to}} grow in dry areas, however in most situations, through the use of rootstocks. Drought-tolerant rootstocks are expected to improve grapevine response to water deficit by improving the water uptake and transport and by reducing the water loss in leaves by root-to-shoot signalling. The mechanisms of rootstocks’ tolerance to drought are not yet fully understood. The main aim {{of this study was to}} improve the understanding of the rootstock/scion-cultivar interaction in the regulation of grapevine water use and leaf stomatal behaviour. Irrigated field vines without any water constraint were compared to rain-fed grapevines subjected to moderate water constraint. To better manage vine water status, reduce variability, and compare more rootstocks, greenhouse trials were also conducted where plants were well watered or subjected to severe water constraints. Pinotage grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) grafted onto 110 Richter, 140 Ruggeri and 1103 Paulsen rootstocks were used for field experiments whereas Pinotage grapevines grafted onto 99 Richter, 110 Richter, 140 Ruggeri, 1103 Paulsen and Ramsey were used for greenhouse experiments. Our study suggested the influence of rootstocks on scion-cultivar water status and leaf stomatal size and density and gas exchange of the scion, implying an influence on water uptake and transport and a tight regulation of the stomatal conductance. Our data supported the hypothesis that the influence of rootstock in response to drought seemed to be higher under increasing water deficit up to a point where the plant water status is the main driver of the stomatal conductance and therefore photosynthesis regulation, considering the plant water status thresholds. In addition, the results suggested that stomatal development is affected by light, drought and possibly by rootstocks. Nevertheless, it is still not clear how the rootstock affects stomatal development and the link with scion-cultivar water use. It seems that the transpiration rate of leaves is more related to stomatal size than density. Thus one possible mechanism of Pinotage leaf adaptation to water constraints was structural during leaf growth, with a reduction in pore size to reduce plant water loss. The results showed that the rootstock is regulating the cultivar's stomatal size (anatomical changes during leaf growth) and functioning (stomatal regulation) through a complex signalling process. The effect of light on stomatal development is interesting in the context of canopy microclimate and <b>canopy</b> <b>manipulation</b> (choice of the vine architecture vs canopy size, in the context of climate change versus the possible increase in drought and water scarcity). The use of rootstocks is a long term investment which aims to provide resistance to soil pests and pathogens and to confer to the scion-cultivar drought and salt tolerance. The use of drought tolerant rootstocks is actually one of the most relevant practical solutions in dry terroir – units and in situations where water availability is limited. The understanding of the physiological and genetic mechanisms which govern scion-cultivar drought tolerance/behaviour induced by rootstocks is critical in terms of rootstocks choice in interaction with the scion-cultivar and is critical to assist breeding programs to create/select drought tolerant rootstocks...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to use a}} {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) architectural plant modelling approach to simulate possible ways to improve the aboveground competitive ability of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) with sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus L.). It is now widely accepted that the best approach to manage weeds in field crops is through {{the development and implementation of}} integrated weed management (IWM) approaches. Such approaches should make use of the competitive ability of the crop canopy and the application of other cultural practices that ultimately reduce the dependence on herbicide use. To help understand the complexity of the different IWM choices available, computational models can be used by the agronomist, plant breeder or agricultural practitioner to simulate and visualise these different cultural practices in weedy situations to evaluate the possible ways to enhance crop competitiveness to the common weeds of that crop. In order to demonstrate the feasibility and value of such an approach, research experiments and modelling techniques have been used to develop architectural models for chickpea and sowthistle. These models were then used to simulate how changes in crop canopy architecture could modify chickpeas competitive ability with sowthistle. In order to determine the potential of using canopy manipulations of the crop to improve its competitive ability with sowthistle, an experiment was conducted in which sowthistle plants were grown under two densities of chickpea and in full sun light (as a control). While the phyllochron and bolting time of sowthistle increased when the light availability decreased, the number of branches, number of capitula and consequently seeds in sowthistle were significantly decreased under reduced light availability. To capture the 3 D architecture of the chickpea and sowthistle, plants were grown separately in a sandy, well watered and fertilized soil. A sonic digitizer system was then used to record a number of chenges in plant morphological, topological, and geometrical changes in a non-destructive way over time. The resulting data sets were analysed and used to develop a realistic, dynamic architectural model for each of the two species. Plant architectural (virtual) models were created using the mathematical formalism of Lindenmayer Systems. The virtual plant models were verified for growth and development, using an independently produced data set. A quasi-Monte Carlo ray tracing program was employed to estimate the light availability under different architectures of the virtual chickpea plants in a chickpea-light environment model. Since the aim was to simulate the effect of the chickpea <b>canopy</b> <b>manipulation</b> on sowthistle morphogenesis, observation of the effect of light availability on sowthistle were used to calibrate the morphogenesis of virtual sowthistle and then this lightsensitive virtual sowthistle was incorporated into the chickpea-light environment model. The key point is that the entire development period and changing light environment is considered. In the final chickpea-light environment-sowthistle (CLES) model the virtual chickpea plants were modified to replicate the architecture of five different cultivars (Macarena, Bumper, Jimbour, 99071 - 1001, and 96033 - 1014). The models were run over time and both visualizations and numerical output were produced to examine their competitive ability with sowthistle. To validate the results of the CLES model, an experiment using the same five chickpea cultivars with a sowthistle growing under their canopy was conducted. The simulation results were found to be in good agreement with the empirical data. The growth of sowthistle, in both in silico and empirical experiments was reduced most by 99071 - 1001 a cultivar with short phyllochron and early branching feature. The second rank of competitive ability in both simulated and observed data belonged to Macarena and Bumper while Jimbour and 96033 - 1014 were the least competitive. Both the simulation and experiment results supported the hypothesis that morphogenesis of a weed can be suppressed under specific canopy architectures of crops. Some practical applications of the developed model are discussed and it is shown that the developed model can be used to explore a number of different agronomic practices such as choice of cultivar and seeding rate in weed management systems. The practical implication of these simulation studies is how a management system that uses quick canopy closure can provide sufficient suppression of weeds in chickpea. The study also demonstrates the versatility of the 3 D plant architectural modelling approach especially when combined with a light environment model to predict how the plant breeder might genetically improve the crop canopy architecture and how the agronomist might modify planting rules, to improve the competitive ability of crops with weeds...|$|E
