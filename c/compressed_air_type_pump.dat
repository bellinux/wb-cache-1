In the experiment, the projective method of the microshot was of the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>type.</b> The microshot of 0. 1 mm diameter was high-carbon cast steel, and the workpiece used was the commercially spring steel JIS-SUP 9.

In the process industry, they are used intensively to provide <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> for all <b>types</b> of pneumatic instruments and tools.

Use of normal pumps for high temperature fluids leads to complications such as damage of pumps, leakage of seals and stalled drives. The pumps available in market are not suited for hot fluid transportation as it results in cavitation. In order to tackle the aforementioned problem a suitable pneumatic pump had been designed and fabricated. This pump uses <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> to pump the hot fluid, with lesser moving parts. It is more compatible with hot fluids, inexpensive with low maintenance and light weight. The <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> is inducted into the regulating section where its direction, rate of flow and pressure are regulated. The regulated air is then sent to pumping section consisting of dual chambers. The principle behind this excogitative <b>type</b> of <b>pump</b> is that, the pressure energy of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> is converted into equivalent static head (potential energy) of the fluid to be pumped. The hydraulic energy of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> is exchanged into hydraulic energy of the fluid to be pumped. Consequently the mutual exchange of energy from air to liquid takes place...|$|R

40|$|A new cooling {{approach}} with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> {{has been developed}} in order to cool the cutting tool edge during turning of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. The cutting forces, chip morphology and chip temperature were measured and compared with those measured during machining with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and dry cutting conditions. The chip temperature is lower with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling than those with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and dry machining. The combined effects of reduced friction and chip bending away from the cutting zone {{as a result of}} the high-speed air produce a thinner chip with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and a thicker chip with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling compared to dry machining alone. The marginally higher cutting force associated with the application of cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> compared with dry machining is the result of lower chip temperatures and a higher shear plane angle. The tendency to form a segmented chip is higher when machining with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> than that with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and dry machining only within the ranges of cutting speed and feed when chip transitions from continuous to the segmented. The effect of cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> on the cutting force and chip formation diminishes with increase in cutting speed and feed rate. The application of both <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> reduced flank wear and the tendency to form the chip built-up edge.
