5|$|The {{most common}} species are game fish, found in Lake Phelps, are largemouth bass, <b>chain</b> <b>pickerel,</b> catfish, yellow perch and pumpkinseed. These fish are what brought the Algonquian {{to the area}} nearly 10,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Cold water {{fishing is}} {{available}} in Black Moshannon Creek and several of its tributaries, where anglers will find rainbow and brown trout that have been stocked there for sport fishing by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Black Moshannon Lake's waters are warmer {{than those of the}} creek, and so hold many different species of fish, including largemouth bass, muskellunge, yellow perch, <b>chain</b> <b>pickerel,</b> bullhead catfish, northern pike, bluegill, and crappie.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the <b>chain</b> <b>pickerel,</b> the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
50|$|Fishing for {{pleasure}} (including ice fishing) is also relatively common, {{mainly on the}} northern shore where there are several fishing areas with dirt paths leading to Pond Street, and on the southern shore near the boat ramp. Rainbow trout, brown trout, brook trout, largemouth bass, <b>chain</b> <b>pickerels,</b> bluegills, pumpkinseeds, brown bullheads, carp, eels, perch, and golden shiners are all relatively common. A type of freshwater hydrozoan, Craspedacusta sowerbyi, {{can also be found}} in the pond.|$|R
50|$|Eleven {{species of}} fish were {{observed}} by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission in Lily Lake in 2013. A total of 365 alewives were caught, as were 333 bluegills with lengths of 2 to 9 in. 93 black crappies from 3 to 16 in in length were observed, as were 53 brown bullheads from 10 to 15 in in length and 36 golder shiners from 3 to 10 in. The survey observed 22 <b>chain</b> <b>pickerels</b> from 13 to 25 in in length, 18 pumpkinseeds from 3 to 9 in in length, 12 yellow perches from 8 to 13 in in length, and 10 hatchery rainbow trout. It observed seven largemouth bass from 2 to 20 in in length and two northern pike from 20 to 25 in in length.|$|R
5|$|In 2003 and 2004, 31 {{fish species}} {{were found at}} 20 sites in the {{watershed}} of Roaring Creek. Eastern blacknose dace {{are the most common}} fish species in the watershed and were observed at 85 percent of the sites. White suckers and brown trout occurred at 80 percent of the sites, longnose dace occurred at 70 percent of the sites, cutlips minnows occurred at 65 percent of the sites, and bluegills occurred at 60 percent of the sites. Fallfish, golden shiners, yellow bullheads, and American eels were all historically observed in the watershed, but were not found during the survey. However, redside dace, creek chubsuckers, green sunfish, and fathead minnows were observed in the watershed for the first time during the 2003/2004 survey. The most common game species was wild brown trout, although smaller numbers of brook trout were observed as well. Other game fish in the creek's drainage basin include rainbow trout. smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and <b>chain</b> <b>pickerel.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Shamokin Creek at Sunbury, {{there were}} 112 {{individual}} fish from 14 different species.

Less common species included pumpkinseeds (six individuals), <b>chain</b> <b>pickerel</b> (five individuals), and spotfin shiners (five individuals). Rarer species included Margined madtom (three individuals) and rock bass and brown bullhead (two individuals each). Only one creek chub, green sunfish, bluegill, tessellated darter, and walleye were observed.|$|E

500|$|Although {{there are}} no {{pollution}} point sources in the drainage basin, acid rain is a major concern. [...] Acidification has altered {{the ecology of the}} lakes and region; in Lake Jean low pH has decreased the number and quality of insects and plankton {{at the base of the}} food chain. Fish which are acid tolerant are predominant, including fathead minnow, muskellunge, pumpkinseed, walleye, and yellow perch. There are relatively few predators like <b>chain</b> <b>pickerel</b> and largemouth bass, and adult fish [...] "appear to have good growth rates but poor reproductive success".|$|E
500|$|In the 19th century Ganoga Lake {{was home}} to trout, {{bullhead}} catfish, pike, pickerel, and black bass.

Predators like <b>chain</b> <b>pickerel</b> and largemouth bass are relatively few in number, and adult fish appear to grow rapidly but breed comparatively poorly. Since 1996, the DCNR has added [...] of powdered lime to the lake each year to make the pH more neutral.|$|E
