5|$|The {{conscription}} law of World War I {{provided for}} noncombatant service {{for members of}} a religious organization whose members were forbidden from participating in war of any form. This exemption effectively limited <b>conscientious</b> <b>objector</b> status {{to members of the}} historic peace churches: Mennonites (and other Anabaptist groups such as Hutterites), Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and Church of the Brethren. The law gave the President authority to assign such draftees to any noncombatant military role.|$|E

5|$|Gibson directed, co-wrote and {{produced}} The Passion of the Christ in 2004, a Biblical epic drama which chronicled the Passion of Jesus. On its release, the film garnered mixed reviews {{as well as}} notoriety for its graphic violence and alleged undertones of antisemitism from critics. Nevertheless, it grossed $370.3 million in the United States and $611.4 million worldwide, making it Gibson's highest-grossing film to date. Two years later he directed, co-wrote {{and produced}} Apocalypto, an epic adventure set in Central America depicting {{the last days of}} Mayan civilization before Spanish arrival in the 16th century. Gibson then took a ten-year hiatus from directing during which time he landed roles in Edge of Darkness (2010), Machete Kills (2013), The Expendables 3 (2014), and Blood Father (2016). He directed Hacksaw Ridge in 2016, a biographical war drama focusing on American World War II veteran Desmond Doss, the first <b>conscientious</b> <b>objector</b> to receive the Medal of Honor. The film garnered praise from critics and audiences alike, as well as various accolades.|$|E
50|$|Historically, <b>conscientious</b> <b>objectors</b> {{have been}} persecuted in the United States. After the Selective Service System was founded during World War I, such persecutions {{decreased}} in frequency, and recognition for <b>conscientious</b> <b>objectors</b> grew.|$|R
50|$|The National Service Act 1948 {{applied to}} all healthy young men who were not {{registered}} as <b>conscientious</b> <b>objectors.</b> It {{did not affect the}} exemption from service of registered <b>conscientious</b> <b>objectors,</b> nor the procedure for registration.|$|R
25|$|The {{group was}} {{organized}} as National Council for Religious <b>Conscientious</b> <b>Objectors</b> on October 5, 1940 {{by the three}} historic peace churches {{in response to the}} Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, which introduced the first peacetime draft in the United States. The Selective Service Act provided for work of national importance and an alternative to military service for <b>conscientious</b> <b>objectors.</b> The immediate task of this group was to advise <b>conscientious</b> <b>objectors</b> and create a structure for the proposed alternative service. On November 26, 1940, National Council for Religious <b>Conscientious</b> <b>Objectors</b> was merged with a similar organization, Civilian Service Board to become National Service Board for Religious Objectors (NSBRO).|$|R

25|$|Summers' {{brother had}} {{enlisted in the}} United States Army at the {{beginning}} of World War II. But Summers, opposed to the use of force, declared himself a <b>conscientious</b> <b>objector.</b> The Illinois State Bar Association admitted he was of high moral character and exhibited excellent knowledge of the law, but denied him admission in 1942 due to his <b>conscientious</b> <b>objector</b> status. In a highly controversial but important decision, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the denial of admission to the bar in In re Summers, 325 U.S. 561 (1945).

Another <b>conscientious</b> <b>objector,</b> Mehmet Tarhan, was sentenced to four years in prison by a military court in 2005 for refusing to do his military service, but he was later released in March 2006.

25|$|On June 28, 1971, the Supreme Court of the United States in Clay v. United States {{overturned}} Ali's conviction by {{a unanimous}} 8–0 decision (Justice Thurgood Marshall recused himself, {{as he had}} been the U.S. Solicitor General at the time of Ali's conviction). The decision was not based on, nor did it address, the merits of Ali's claims per se; rather, the Court held that since the appeal board gave no reason for the denial of a <b>conscientious</b> <b>objector</b> exemption to Ali, and that it was therefore impossible to determine which of the three basic tests for <b>conscientious</b> <b>objector</b> status offered in the Justice Department's brief that the appeal board relied on, Ali's conviction must be reversed.|$|E
