5|$|The first coroner's inquest into Smith's suicide {{began in}} May 2011. The inquest, {{initially}} led by deputy chief <b>coroner</b> Dr. Bonita Porter, was controversial; {{it was originally}} scheduled to begin in November 2010, but was delayed by a legal challenge by the Smith family. As {{a result of this}} challenge, the scope of the inquest was broadened to cover the entire 11-month period of Smith's incarceration under the federal Correctional Service. Further, a panel of judges with the Ontario Divisional Court ruled in May 2011 that Dr. Porter should not have excluded video evidence of Smith's forced sedation at the Joliette Institution in Quebec. On 21 June 2011, the proceedings of the inquest were suspended until 12 September; the reason for the delay was apparently to allow the proceedings to be webcast. In late June 2011, Dr. Porter was replaced as the presiding <b>coroner,</b> apparently due to her impending retirement in November 2011; the replacement presiding <b>coroner</b> was Dr. John R. Carlisle. The sudden and unexpected replacement led Smith's family to formally accuse the chief <b>coroner</b> of interfering in the inquest with no legal basis; Dr. Porter had apparently indicated that she would deliver three outstanding rulings in July, days before the announcement of her replacement. The inquest resumed briefly on 12 September, only to be suspended once again until 19 September, when the Smith family lawyer challenged the right of the new <b>coroner</b> to continue the inquest, and called for a mistrial. On 30 September 2011, the Ontario Coroner's Office formally terminated the inquest and dismissed the jury.|$|E
5|$|The inquest was {{frequently}} interrupted by multiple legal challenges {{and a change}} of <b>coroner,</b> before finally being terminated as a mistrial on 30 September 2011; a new inquest into Smith's death began on 19 September 2012.

The <b>coroner</b> said the creature was neither bat nor man. Then the <b>coroner</b> was killed a few days later and soon after a few more people were killed or disappeared.|$|E
