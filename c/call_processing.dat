2500|$|The company's history {{goes back}} to the 1980s when the first {{versions}} of Intel server-based voice messaging and <b>call</b> <b>processing</b> systems were released. The CallXpress product originated from Applied Voice Technology (AVT, NASDAQ:AVTC) which later became Captaris, Inc. [...] In 2003, Sound Advantage purchased the CallXpress Voicemail and Unified Messaging solution from Captaris and this merger of technologies became a new entity called Applied Voice & Speech Technologies, Inc. (AVST). The acquisition included the retention of key products and technology as well as the entire product engineering, support and sales teams. AVST was established in September 2003 by the merger of Sound Advantage (established in 1997) and the AVT division (established in 1982) of Captaris, Inc. (NASDAQ: CAPA).|$|E
