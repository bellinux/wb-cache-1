40|$|AbstractThe Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, {{a global}} health treaty {{ratified}} by over 175 countries, calls on countries {{to ensure that}} tobacco packages carry health warning labels (HWLs) describing {{the harmful effects of}} tobacco use. We assessed the extent of compliance with 14 countries' HWL requirements. Unique cigarette packs were purchased in 2013 using a systematic protocol in 12 distinct neighborhoods within three of the ten most populous cities in the 14 low- and middle-income countries with the greatest number (count) of smokers. HWL compliance codebooks were developed for each country based on the details of country-specific HWL requirements, with up to four common compliance indicators assessed for each country (location, size, label elements, text size). Packs (n= 1859) were double coded for compliance. Compliance was examined by country and pack characteristics, including parent company and brand family. Overall, 72 % of coded cigarette packs were compliant with all relevant compliance indicators, ranging from 17 % in the Philippines to 94 % in Mexico. Compliance was highest for location of the warning (ranging from 75 %– 100 %) and lowest for warning size (ranging from 46 %– 99 %). Compliance was higher for packs bought in high SES neighborhoods, and varied by parent company and brand family. This multi-country study found at least one pack in every country – and many packs in some countries – that were not compliant with key requirements for health warning labels in the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase.</b> Non-compliance may be exacerbating health disparities. Tobacco companies should be held accountable for complying with country HWL requirements...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – Despite the {{well-established}} {{impact of}} consumer ethnocentrism (CET) on purchase intentions, extant literature offers limited evidence on actual purchase behaviour. This study addresses this gap by investigating the factors underlying variations in consumer ethnocentric behaviour using reported brand purchases. Product category, product cost and visibility, brand and <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>purchased</b> products are investigated for {{their impact on}} the differences in the behavioural effects of CET. Design/methodology/approach – This study uses survey data collected in the United States from a sample of 468 consumers. Self-reported brand purchases are used and involve 10 product categories, 432 brands, and 22 <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> origin. Logistic regressions for repeated measures are used to test the hypotheses formulated. Findings – The results confirm that product category is an important determinant of the behavioural effects of CET. CET also has a significant impact on <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> the most expensive product categories rather than frequently purchased convenient items. Contrary to existing empirical evidence, cultural similarity does not mitigate the negative effects of CET and product visibility does not strengthen the behavioural effect of CET. Practical implications – The study results should enhance managers’ understanding of the determinants of ethnocentric behaviour. The results caution managers about the value of self-reported measures and indicate that product features other than <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin may be more effective in mitigating the negative effects of CET. Originality/value – This study contributes to extant literature on CET and <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin by investigating, for the first time, the problem of inconsistent predictions <b>of</b> <b>purchase</b> behaviour in the context of foreign versus domestic brands.

A total of 176 respondents which are full time registered international students from 12 countries participated in this research. Results for the study showed that Japan, USA, UK, South Korea, top the first four rank for the ranking of car quality. Malaysia only managed to secure a number eight in terms of the ranking. In other words, quality of cars in developed countries was seen as better than developing countries. This finding indicated the support of extensive research and literature that had been done earlier by researchers in this field. On the other hand, the effect <b>of</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin in <b>purchasing</b> decision was significantly different between regions but not significantly different among age, gender and program of study.

40|$|Background: New psychoactive {{substances}} (NPS) are on offer worldwide online, {{in order}} {{to shed light on}} the purity and price of these substances in the European Union, a research collaboration was set up involving France, United Kingdom (UK), the Netherlands, Czech Republic and Poland. Methods: Per country, around 10 different NPS were test purchased from different webshops. Then, chemical analysis of NPS was done with according reference standards to identify and quantify the contents. Results: In contrast to what is generally advertised on the webshops (> 99 %), purity varied considerably per test purchased NPS. Several NPS were mislabelled, some containing chemical analogues (e. g. 25 B/C-NBOMe instead of 25 I-NBOMe, pentedrone instead of 3, 4 - DMMC). But in some cases NPS differed substantially from what was advertised (e. g. pentedrone instead of AMT or 3 -FMC instead of 5 -MeO-DALT). Per gram, purity-adjusted prices of cathinones differed substantially between three <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> test <b>purchase,</b> with Poland being the least expensive. Synthetic cannabinoids were relatively the most expensive in the Czech Republic and least expensive in the UK. Conclusions: The current findings provides a snapshot of the price and chemical contents <b>of</b> NPS products <b>purchased</b> by different countries and in different webshops. There is a potential danger of mislabelling of NPS. The great variety in price and purity of the delivered products might be the result of the market dynamics of supply and demand and the role of law enforcement in different European countries...|$|R

60|$|When {{bills on}} foreign {{countries}} {{are at a}} premium, it is customary {{to say that the}} exchanges are against the country, or unfavorable to it. In order to understand these phrases, we must take notice of what “the exchange,” in the language of merchants, really means. It means the power which the money <b>of</b> the <b>country</b> has <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> the money <b>of</b> other <b>countries.</b> Supposing $4.86 to be the exact par of exchange, then when it requires more than $1,000 to buy a bill of £205, $1,000 of American money are worth less than their real equivalent of English money: and this is called an exchange unfavorable to the United States. The only persons in the United States, however, to whom it is really unfavorable are those who have money to pay in England, for they come into the bill market as buyers, and have to pay a premium; but to those who have money to receive in England the same state of things is favorable; for they come as sellers and receive the premium. The premium, however, indicates that a balance is due by the United States, which must be eventually liquidated in the precious metals; and since, according to the old theory, the benefit of a trade consisted in bringing money into the country, this prejudice introduced the practice of calling the exchange favorable when it indicated a balance to receive, and unfavorable when it indicated one to pay; and the phrases in turn tended to maintain the prejudice.|$|R

40|$|The Norwegian {{market share}} in the Spanish market for salted cod has {{decreased}} significantly over the past years. Norwegian producers {{have not been able}} to deliver products that are in line with the consumer preferences in this market, and the quality of the delivered products are believed to be inferior to that of the competitors. The Spansih seafood market is one of the most attractive domestic markets in Europe, and has the second highest expenditure per capita indicating that there are great potential. Studies have shown that consumers do not know the correct <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin (COO) (Diamantopoulos et al. 2011). Consumer perception, product features, COO, and COO perception have an influence on purchase intention (C. L Wang cited in Rezvani e al., 2012). COO can help consumers to form preferences and purchase decisions (Yasin et al., 2007), and buyers use COO as an indicator of quality (Lee and Lee, 2009). Previous research has mostly focused either on a qualitative or a quantitative approach, but very few have combined the two. Our study combines the two approaches to get a better understanding of the Spanish market for salted cod. This thesis is based on 34 in-depth interviews with consumers and the distribution chain in Spain, exporters in Norway, and a quantitative survey in Spain, where 81 complete responses were collected. The respondents were consumers based mainly in the regions Cantabria, Comunidad Valenciana and Cataluña. Our research question is: How does <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin affect <b>purchase</b> intention <b>of</b> Norwegian salted cod in Spain? In addition, we developed two additional research questions during the field study to examine other areas of interest: How do product preferences differ between regions in Spain? and Can Spanish consumers differentiate between Norwegian and Icelandic salted cod? Findings indicate that <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin in most cases does not affect <b>purchase</b> intention <b>of</b> Norwegian salted cod. In our research model, price, quality, distribution and product attributes such as color and thickness, brand awareness, and brand image (Norwegian salted cod being the brand) are the drivers suspected to affect purchase intention. The qualitative approach indicates that quality and product attributes are the most important drivers <b>of</b> <b>purchase</b> intention, and that COO has little importance.
