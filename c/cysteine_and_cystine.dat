5000|$|The website www.cystinuria.org {{was founded}} on October 17 of 2002 and was {{opened to the public}} later that month. The initial site {{featured}} the first version of the Cystinuria.org community forum as well as a dictionary to aid interested readers in understanding cystinuria-relevant scientific literature. In mid November, the first learning tutorial was published, providing readers with a basic understanding of amino acid structure and function with an emphasis on <b>cysteine</b> <b>and</b> <b>cystine.</b> More tutorials were added covering the relevant topics of stone formation, stone prevention, and antibiotic use (for patients with recurring infections). The development of educational tutorials continued into early 2004, when the site became the online home of the newly incorporated Cystinuria Foundation of America (CysFA). On August 8, 2005, following the successful organization of the first Cystinuria Sympoiusm, CysFA was dissolved and the International Cystinuria Foundation was incorporated in its place to reflect the goal of reaching out to affected individuals worldwide. On March 30, 2006, the ICF was awarded 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and classified as a public charity.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{study the}} effect of sulfur-containing amino acids (L-cysteine, L-cystine, L-methionine and DL-ethionine) on the {{production}} of dithiolopyrrolone antibiotics by Saccharothrix algeriensis NRRL B- 24137. Methods and Results:  The production levels of dithiolopyrrolones were investigated by using high performance liquid chromatography in a chemically semi-synthetic medium. The production of the studied antibiotics depends upon the nature, concentration {{and the time of}} addition of these sources in the culture medium. Both <b>cysteine</b> <b>and</b> <b>cystine</b> favoured the specific productions of dithiolopyrrolones; iso-butyryl-pyrrothine (ISP) by cysteine, however butanoyl-pyrrothine, senecioyl-pyrrothine and tigloyl-pyrrothine by cystine, when added initially to the culture medium. The maximum specific productions of dithiolopyrrolones were observed in the presence of 5 [*]mmol[*]l− 1 cystine for thiolutin, 5 [*]mmol[*]l− 1 cysteine for ISP, and 10 [*]mmol[*]l− 1 cystine for others studied dithiolopyrrolones as shown in Fig. 3. The production of these antibiotics was decreased when the concentrations of <b>cysteine</b> <b>and</b> <b>cystine</b> were in excess. All dithiolopyrrolone specific productions were strongly inhibited by addition of methionine and ethionine, without inhibition of mycelial growth. Conclusions:  Among all studied amino acids, cystine and cysteine can be used as supplements for improvement the production of dithiolopyrrolone antibiotics by S. algeriensis NRRL B- 24137. Significance and Impact of the Study:  Dithiolopyrrolone antibiotics have many important applications for employing them as medicaments, particularly in the treatment of human and animal cancers. In the present work, the influence of containing-sulfur amino acids on dithiolopyrrolone antibiotic productions was studied. The obtained results can be employed for the optimization of the culture medium for the dithiolopyrrolone productions in higher quantities...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objective: In {{the present}} study, Bacillus polymyxa NCIM No. 2539 was {{selected}} to utilize agro-industrial byproduct (orange peel) for amylase production under submerged fermentation conditions. Material and Methods: Different agro-industrial byproducts like cane molasses, wheat bran, rice bran and orange peel were screened for maximum amylase production. Amylase activitiy of Bacillus polymyxa was studied using starch-agar plate method. MINITAB software Version 17 and central composite design were applied to evaluate effect of supplementation of substrate with different sulphur containing amino acids (<b>cysteine,</b> methionine <b>and</b> <b>cystine)</b> <b>and</b> vitamin thiamine on enzyme activity. Further optimization of the parameters viz. amount of substrate, concentration of amino acid and vitamin for maximum amylase production was studied by central composite rotatable design. Results and Conclusion: Among 4 different agro-industrial substrates applied, orange peel showed maximum enzyme production (activity: 492. 31 IU g- 1 sample). Supplementation of the production media with cysteine showed maximum amylase production (515. 38 IU g- 1 sample) among all three amino acids and control. Supplementation with thiamine also showed more amylase production (469. 23 IU g- 1 sample) as compared to control (415. 38 IU g- 1). <b>Cysteine</b> <b>and</b> thiamine proved to increase amylase production significantly.

40|$|Cysteine {{biosynthesis}} {{plays an}} important role in plants for sulfur assimilation. Cysteine regulates the detoxification of cyanide that is a respiratory inhibitor generated mainly during ethylene biosynthesis in higher plants. Cyanide detoxification occurs by the ß-substitution of the sulfhydryl of cysteine with cyanide catalyzed into β-cyanoalanine by the ß-cyanoalanine synthase (β-CAS) enzyme in the mitochondria. In plants and bacteria two enzymes catalyze the synthesis of cysteine; serine acetyltransferase (SAT) transfer acetyl- CoA to serine, generating oacetylserine (OAS) which further combines with sulfide ion to form cysteine, the latter reaction is catalyzed by O-acetyl serine sulfhydrylase (OASS). SAT and OASS associate to form cysteine synthase complex (CSC). The isoforms of SAT and OASS have been found in the cytosol, plastids, and mitochondria of several dicotyledonous plants. The function of cysteine synthesis at various sites and its transport within the compartments of the cell is ambiguous. Two type of dicot plant material, wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis thaliana and pear fruits that are distinct in nature, family and origin were selected for this research. Pears are pomaceous fruits that produce a large amount of ethylene during fruit ripening. The selection of fruit material was based on its ethylene measurements. WT Arabidopsis was grown on MS medium and 15 - 20 days old rosettes were used for the experimental purpose. The mitochondria from both types of plants were isolated and purified using continuous percoll gradient. It was used for respirometry, liquid scintillation counting, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) assays. The analysis of quality of mitochondria was based on respiratory control ratio, coupling, ADP: O ratio and cytochrome C oxidase latency test. According to oxygraph assays, cyanide inhibits the respiration process, but the application of L-cysteine as low as 5 μM in pear and 10 μM L-cysteine in Arabidopsis mitochondria can protect the rate of respiration and assist in cyanide detoxification. 2. 5 μM cystine also shows the similar effect as tested for pear mitochondria. Cyanide concentration required for total inhibition of respiration range between 10 μM to 100 μM. Amino-oxyacetic acid assay suggested that β-cyanoalanine synthase signals the mitochondrial transport of <b>cysteine</b> <b>and</b> <b>cystine.</b> Dithiothreitol (DTT) reduction and Nethylmaleimide (NEM) assay inferred that cysteine is a preferred substrate for cyanide detoxification. Respirometry analysis shows that L-glutamic acid competes with both <b>cysteine</b> <b>and</b> <b>cystine,</b> and aspartic acid interferes with transportation of cystine more than that of cysteine. The specific inhibitors of Xag transport system (AβH, i. e., aspartic-β-hydroxamate) and Xc system (quisqualic acid, S- 4 -Carboxyphenylglycine (CPG)) inhibit the <b>cysteine</b> <b>and</b> <b>cystine</b> transport in pears. These inhibitors were further tested in liquid scintillation counting by using Lcysteine S^ 35 radioisotope and LC-MS/MS experiments by estimating β-cyanoalanine synthesis. The inhibitory effect of chemical inhibitors on cysteine import was found partial for pear and minimal in Arabidopsis mitochondria. But the results obtained from glutamic acid competition in respiratory experiments correspond well with the competitive assays carried out for liquid scintillation counting and LC-MS/MS. This analysis supports the hypothesis that the cysteine is imported into the mitochondria and competes with glutamic acid while transport. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

Synaptic glutamate homeostasis is regulated by cystinedependent glutamate transporters, including GLT- 1 and system x. In HD, the enzyme regulating <b>cysteine</b> (<b>and</b> subsequently <b>cystine)</b> production, cystathionine-γ-lygase, has recently been shown to be lowered. The aim {{of the present study was}} to establish whether cysteine supplementation, using N-acetylcysteine (NAC) could ameliorate glutamate pathology through the cystine-dependent transporters, system x and GLT- 1. We demonstrate that the R 6 / 1 transgenic mouse model of HD has lower basal levels of <b>cystine,</b> <b>and</b> showed depressive-like behaviors in the forced-swim test. Administration of NAC reversed these behaviors. This effect was blocked by co-administration of the system x and GLT- 1 inhibitors CPG and DHK, showing that glutamate transporter activity was required for the antidepressant effects of NAC. NAC was also able to specifically increase glutamate in HD mice, in a glutamate transporter-dependent manner. These in vivo changes reflect changes in glutamate transporter protein in HD mice and human HD post-mortem tissue. Furthermore, NAC was able to rescue changes in key glutamate receptor proteins related to excitotoxicity in HD, including NMDAR 2 B. Thus, we have shown that baseline reductions in cysteine underlie glutamatergic dysfunction and depressive-like behavior in HD and these changes can be rescued by treatment with NAC. These findings have implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches for depressive disorders...|$|R
40|$|Apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II), {{a protein}} {{constituent}} of very low density lipoproteins of human plasma and the activator protein of lipoprotein lipase, has been isolated and its {{amino acid sequence}} has been studied. The protein has 78 amino acid residues <b>and</b> is lacking <b>cysteine,</b> <b>cystine,</b> <b>and</b> histidine. Chromatography on Bio-Gel P- 30 in 25 % formic acid of the cyanogen bromide digest of apoC-II yields three fragments designated as CNBr-I, -II, and -III. They contained 50, 19, and 9 residues, respectively. The alignment of the cyanogen bromide fragments has been established as CNBr-III-I-II by isolation and sequence of the tryptic peptides of the intact protein. The amino acid sequences of the tryptic and CNBr peptides were determined by conventional methods. With this information, {{it was possible to}} establish the complete amino acid sequence of apoC-II...|$|R

40|$|AbstractProtocols for the {{analysis}} of the sulfhydryl content in peptides and proteins using chemical derivatization by organomercurial reagents and analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) have been developed. The number of reactive cysteine residues in peptides and proteins can be determined by exploiting the affinity and selectivity of organomercurial reagents for macromolecular thiols. Mass shifts observed in MALDI mass spectra obtained before and after cysteine derivatization with p-hydroxy-mercuribenzoate (pHMB) permit the number of free sulfhydryl groups to be determined. The pHMB derivative of each free cysteine residue provides a mass shift of 321 u, overcoming limitations in the mass resolution of MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Reactive cysteine residues in a macromolecule can be selectively derivatized by using a fivefold molar excess of pHMB reagent. Total sulfhydryl content (i. e., <b>cysteine</b> <b>and</b> <b>cystine)</b> can be determined after disulfide reduction. However, analyses for total cysteine content are more complex, requiring protein denaturation, cystine reduction, and sample purification before derivatization and analysis by MALDI-MS. Conditions for sample denaturation, alkyl-phosphine reduction, pHMB derivatization, and sample purification by analyte adsorption and desalting on protein transfer membranes, are described for cysteine/cystine analysis performed on microgram (10 – 200 pmol) quantities of somatostatin, insulin, hemoglobin, and β-lactoglobulin...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{describes the}} development of a solid and a liquid medium (Gonococcal Genetic Medium; GGM) which support the rapid growth of 41 gonococcal clinical isolates and laboratory strains with a minimum number of nutritional components. The complete medium contains minimal salts, eight amino acids, two nitrogen bases, vitamins, coenzymes, key metabolic intermediates, and some miscellaneous components. Results indicate that GGM can be modified and simplified even further than we described. In liquid GGM, several gonococcal strains grew logarithmically after a 2 - to 3 -h lag period with generation times ranging from 72 to 115 min, reaching optical densities of 175 to 320 Klett units in the presence of seven amino acids {{and in the absence of}} a CO 2 atmosphere. The development of a solid and a liquid defined minimal medium such as GGM should greatly broaden the avenues of experimentation for biochemical genetic studies with N. gonorrhoeae, especially gonococcal genetic transformation. N. gonorrhoeae can be classified into eight major and minor phenotypic groups, depending on its growth responses on GGM to just five amino acids: <b>cysteine</b> <b>and</b> <b>cystine,</b> arginine, proline, isoleucine, and serine. Such results demonstrate the feasibility of using GGM as a simple, sensitive, rapid probe for investigating the epidemiological patterns of gonorrhea...|$|E
40|$|Iron pyrite (FeS$_{ 2 }$) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} metal sulfide on Earth. Owing to its reactivity and catalytic activity, pyrite has been studied in various research fields such as surface science, geochemistry, and prebiotic chemistry. Importantly, native iron-sulfur clusters are typically coordinated by cysteinyl ligands of iron-sulfur proteins. In the present paper, we study the adsorption of L-cysteine and its oxidized dimer, L-cystine, on the FeS$_{ 2 }$ surface, using electronic structure calculations based density functional theory and Raman spectroscopy measurements. Our calculations suggest that sulfur-deficient surfaces {{play an important role}} in the adsorption of <b>cysteine</b> <b>and</b> <b>cystine.</b> In the thiol headgroup adsorption on the sulfur-vacancy site, dissociative adsorption is found to be energetically favorable compared with molecular adsorption. In addition, the calculations indicate that, in the cystine adsorption on the defective surface under vacuum conditions, the formation of the S-Fe bond is energetically favorable compared with molecular adsorption. Raman spectroscopic measurements suggest the formation of cystine molecules through the S-S bond on the pyrite surface in aqueous solution. Our results might have implications for chemical evolution at mineral surfaces on the early Earth and the origin of iron-sulfur proteins, which are believed to be one of the most ancient families of proteins.

40|$|Oxidised low density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) {{may play}} a role in atherogenesis. We have investigated some of the mechanisms by which the thiol <b>cysteine</b> <b>and</b> the disulphide <b>cystine</b> can influence the oxidation of LDL by copper ions. Cysteine or cystine (100 PM) inhibited the oxidation of native LDL by copper in a simple phosphate buffer. One of the mechanisms by which cysteine (or more likely its oxidation products in the presence of copper) <b>and</b> <b>cystine</b> inhibited LDL oxidation was by decreasing the binding of copper to LDL (97 % inhibition). Cysteine, but not cystine, rapidly reduced Cu 2 + to Cu+. This may help to explain the antioxidant effect of cysteine as it may limit the amount of Cu 2 + that is available to convert alpha-tocopherol in LDL into the prooxidant alpha-tocopherol radical. Cysteine (but not cystine) had a prooxidant effect, however, toward partially oxidised LDL in the presence of a low copper concentration, which may have been due to the rapid breakdown of lipid hydroperoxides in partially oxidised LDL by Cu+ generated by cysteine. To prove that cysteine can cause the rapid breakdown of lipid hydroperoxides in LDL, we enriched LDL with lipid hydroperoxides using an azo initiator in the absence of copper. Cysteine, but not cystine, increased the rate of lipid hydroperoxide decomposition to thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in the presence of copper. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|A new acidic {{ninhydrin}} {{method for}} determining free sialic acids is described. The method {{is based on}} the reaction of sialic acids with Gaitonde's acid ninhydrin reagent 2 which yields a stable color with an absorption maximum at 470 nm. The standard curve is linear in the range of 5 to 500 nmol of N-acetylneuraminic acid per 0. 9 ml of reaction mixture. The reaction was specific only for sialic acids among the various sugars and sugar derivatives examined. Some interference of this method by <b>cysteine,</b> <b>cystine</b> <b>and</b> tryptophan was noted, although their absorption maxima differed from that of sialic acids. The interference by these amino acids was eliminated {{with the use of a}} small column of cation-exchange resin. The acidic ninhydrin method provides a simple and rapid method for the determination of free sialic acids in biological materials. </p...|$|R
40|$|Porphyrin auxotrophs of Bacillus subtilis can {{be divided}} into two groups. Strains {{belonging}} to the first group (hemA, hemB, or hemC) are not able to synthesize or metabolize porphobilinogen. These strains require <b>cysteine,</b> <b>cystine,</b> <b>and</b> methionine, respectively. Traces of aminolevulinic acid, in a hemin-containing medium, can replace the cysteine requirement in a mutant lacking aminolevulinic acid synthetase. In bacteria belonging to the second group (hemE, hemF, or hemG), porphyrin biosynthesis is blocked at later steps, and the amino acids mentioned above are not required. It is of interest that both the activity of ribonucleotide reductase and the amount of vitamin B 12 were significantly lower in the first group. The addition of vitamin B 12 to the medium did not promote the growth of strains examined. We assume that porphobilinogen deaminase is essential for the synthesis of corrinoids...|$|R
