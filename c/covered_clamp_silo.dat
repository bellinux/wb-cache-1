The {{effect on}} {{voluntary}} feed intake, in vivo digestibility and nitrogen balance in sheep of feeding grass silage or pea?wheat intercrops differing in pea to wheat ratio and maturity. ? Animal Feed Science and Technology, 96, (3 - 4), 161 - 173. Sponsorship: Milk Development CouncilThis study determined {{the effect on}} the voluntary feed intake (VFI), in vivo digestibility and nitrogen (N) retention in sheep of feeding grass silage or pea?wheat bi-crop forages differing in maturity at harvest and pea to wheat ratio. Two bi-crops drilled at pea to wheat ratios of 25 : 75 (low pea; LP) or 75 : 25 (high pea; HP) on a dry matter (DM) basis were grown on each half of 6. 5 and 3. 5 ha fields and harvested after either 13 (cut 1; C 1) or 15 (cut 2; C 2) weeks of growth. The four resulting forages were ensiled in separate 40 t <b>clamp</b> <b>silos</b> and evaluated against a perennial ryegrass (PRG) silage, as a control, in an in vivo digestibility trial. Each forage was fed with 7 g of mineral/vitamin supplement daily to four Lleyns wether sheep for a 14 -day adaptation period and a 10 -day balance period. Daily forage intake and total faecal and urine output were measured and N balance was estimated.

During ensiling the amount of crop of 104 grass silage clamps, 42 maize silage clamps and 108 big bales (54 round and 54 square) were weighted and after ensiling the dimensions were measured and the chemical composition was analysed. For round and square bales a new regression formula was derived, which estimates the density more accurate than the current table values. It is recommended to calculate the density of round en square bales with the following formula: Density (kg/m 3) = 994. 81 - 0. 5335 x dry matter content (g/kg) - 1. 196 x crude fibre content (g/kg ds).

40|$|Deflections {{and strains}} in an ice {{cover of a}} frozen channel caused by an {{underwater}} body moving under the ice with a constant speed along the channel are studied. The channel is of rectangular cross section, the fluid in the channel is inviscid and incompressible. The ice <b>cover</b> is <b>clamped</b> to the channel walls. The ice cover is modeled by a thin viscoelastic plate. The underwater body is modeled by a three-dimensional dipole. The intensity of the dipole {{is related to the}} speed and size of the underwater body. The problem is considered within the linear theory of hydroelasticity. For small deflections of the ice cover the velocity potential of the dipole in the channel is obtained by the method of images in leading order without account for the deflection of the ice cover. The problem of moving dipole in the channel with rigid walls provides the hydrodynamic pressure on the upper boundary of the channel, which corresponds to the ice cover. This pressure distribution does not depend on the deflection of the ice cover in the leading approximation. The deflections of the ice and strains in the ice plate are independent of time in the coordinate system moving together with the dipole. The problem is solved numerically using the Fourier transform, method of the normal modes and the truncation method for infinite systems of algebraic equations...|$|R

Prvi, manji, sjeverni dio izgrađen je 1486, a drugi, nešto veći, 1487. godine. Ta dva dijela su 1498. povezana, a 1514. godine su Kaše dograđene prema sjeveru. Prilikom gradnje primijenjene su, u renesansi ponovo otkrivene, antičke tehnike gradnje. Valobran je izgrađen u suhom doku, a ne u kesonu, kako se dosad smatralo. Suhi dok izrađen je kao drvena kutija čije se dno sastojalo od dva sloja greda, dok su bočne stranice bile oplaćene jednim slojem greda. Suhi dok je potopljen na mjestu gradnje, a potom je isušen.

5000|$|The main {{components}} that comprised START included the support structure, pulse transformer, vacuum tank, toroidal and poloidal field coils, and a limiter. The support structure positioned {{and supported the}} vacuum tank which also shared the same spherical center as the large pulse transformer. The main role of the pulse transformer was to provide the current for the toroidal field coils which was supplied through fifteen irons cores that were spirally wound from a [...]03 millimeter iron strip. The toroidal field coil was a central conductor made of copper on the axis of the vacuum tank, and {{was attached to the}} vacuum tank through copper limbs <b>covered</b> by insulated <b>clamps.</b> START had six poloidal field coils within the vacuum tank and were encased in 3 millimeter stainless steel cases. The poloidal coils were supported {{from the base of the}} tank and each could be adjusted as necessary. The vacuum tank was the primary vessel where experiments take place; it was cylindrical in shape and was divided into three sections. The tank offered numerous ports for the attachment of pumps and diagnostics. A graphite limiter was positioned around the central stainless steel tube and this provided a simple way to measure the innermost edge of the plasma during experiments.|$|R
50|$|In 1964, Dr. Biard {{designed}} linear transimpedance amplifiers (TIA) to {{work with}} silicon photodiodes for receiving optical signals generated by LEDs. When the signal current from the silicon photodiode was too large, the input stage of the amplifier would saturate and cause undesirable delays when the optical signal was removed. Dr. Biard solved this problem by connecting a silicon HP Schottky diode across the collector-base junction of the input transistor. Since the Schottky diode had a lower forward drop than the transistor PN junction, the transistor did not saturate and the undesirable delay time was eliminated. The engineer in the next office at the SRD Lab was developing Diode Transistor Logic (DTL) ICs and also having saturation problems. Dr. Biard decided to use what he learned with the optical receiver amplifiers and apply that to the bipolar logic circuits. On December 31, 1964, Dr. Biard filed a patent for the Schottky transistor (U.S. Patent US3463975), a.k.a. the Schottky-clamped transistor, which consisted of a transistor and an internal metal-semiconductor Schottky-barrier diode. The patent was filed based on Schottky Clamped DTL monolithic integrated logic circuits using aluminum-silicon Schottky diodes across the collector-base junctions of the transistors and in the input to adjust the logic levels. The diode prevented the transistor from saturating by minimizing the forward bias on the collector-base transistor junction, thus reducing the minority carrier injection to a negligible amount. The Schottky diode could be integrated on the same die, it had a compact layout, it had no minority carrier charge storage, and it was faster than a conventional junction diode. Dr. Biard's patent was filed before Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) circuits had been invented, yet it was written broadly enough to <b>cover</b> the Schottky <b>clamped</b> TTL ICs using platinum silicide Schottky diodes, which were much more predictable and manufacturable than the aluminum Schottky diodes he originally used. His patent ultimately improved the switching speed of saturated logic designs, such as the Schottky-TTL, at a low cost. In 1985, Dr. Biard received the Patrick E. Haggerty Innovation Award for this patent.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 A {{technique}} for estimating {{gross primary production}} and respiration of periphyton communities, in situ, in small turbulent streams was developed using a photosynthesis-respiration chamber in a modified "light and dark bottle" method. Trays containing portions of the substrate bearing the benthic community were embedded in the stream, level with the bottom. A clear plexiglas <b>cover</b> could be <b>clamped</b> to a tray to make it part of a closed {{system in which the}} water was mixed, circulated, and exchanged to facilitate measurement of changes in the concentration of dissolved oxygen. The rates of gross primary production and respiration of the periphyton communities in two coastal streams in Oregon were estimated periodically during the six months from July through December 1964 by hourly determinations of the changes in concentration of dissolved oxygen in the chamber. The rates so determined were used to demonstrate seasonal trends in both processes and to obtain quantitative relationships between these processes and the environmental parameters known to control them. These relationships were determined by formulating multiple regression equations for both components of community metabolism using light intensity, water temperature, and plant biomass as the independent variables for gross production and the latter two plus the wet weight of the animal fraction of the community for respiration computations. Respective R² values of 0. 971 and 0. 800 for each stream indicated that most of the variability in the gross production process was accounted for and that the relationships involved were not the same in both streams. A single R² value of 0. 821 was obtained from the measurements of community respiration since differences in the variability between streams were not statistically significant. The resulting equations were also used to predict production and respiration on a monthly basis. A portable illumination totalizer was used to measure incident solar radiation striking the streams in gram-calories per cm². The influence of the canopy and surrounding topography in determining available light was found to be significant and varied for each stream. Approximately 75 to 95 percent of the total light energy was absorbed and reflected and did not reach the communities in the streams. The predicted range of gross production (0. 34 -l. 28 g O₂/m²/day) was substantially lower than results reported from other in situ investigations using the oxygen method. The most apparent reasons for these low levels were low light availability and instability of the bottom substrate. An asymptotic gross photosynthesis-light intensity curve was obtained by plotting actual dissolved oxygen changes against observed light intensities. The shape of the curve was similar to that obtained in a laboratory community. Predicted rates of respiration (0. 22 - 1. 60 g O₂/m²/day) were consistently higher than equivalent estimates of gross production until November, when the animal fraction of the community was reduced. For most of the season both streams were heterotrophic, obtaining a significant amount of their energy from the surrounding watershed...|$|R
