The discovery was published in <b>Circular</b> of the <b>Union</b> Observatory No. 49, hence its discovery name is UO 49, or In UOC 49. However, UO designations should be used with caution since they are often not unique for each star: the number in the name {{is the number of}} Circular, so all stars published in one Circular have identical names. So, all other newfound stars, published in the 49th Circular, may be named UO 49 too.|$|R

The director of the MPC, Dr. Brian G. Marsden called Young the third most accurate and reliable observer in the world then. He also co-authored and authored over 1500 MPECs (Minor Planet Electronic Circulars) and IAUCs (International Astronomical <b>Union</b> <b>Circulars)</b> during these last 7 years at JPL.

40|$|International Astronomical <b>Union,</b> <b>Circular</b> No. 5481) {{recently}} reported {{the observation of}} a (545 ± 11) keV line in the spectrum of the Crab Nebula. It is tempting to associate this with the positron-electron annihilation line at 511 keV. If this line originates from some transition at {{the surface of the}} neutron star in the Crab, we expect a red shift of around 10 % rather then the observed blue shift of ∼ 35 keV; in fact, this gravitational red shift implies that the natural frequency of the observed line is also 10 % higher, or around 600 keV. In this article we shall present a mechanism for generating such a split from 511 keV. For this mechanism to be successful we require: (a) surface magnetic fields, in the annihilation region, to be (3 − 8) × 10 12 G and to point in our direction, (b) surface densities of (10 5 − 10 6) g/cc.

30|$|In {{fractures}} {{complicated by}} infection, significant bone loss or malalignment, {{the use of}} circular frames allows all these to be addressed concurrently while treating the non-union. Mahaluxmivala et al. treated 18 non-unions, including 10 infected cases, with a circular frame. All patients went on to achieve union. Six patients underwent bone transport for bone loss, five of whom required additional bone grafting [8]. Hosny et al. [9] used circular frames and a compression–distraction technique to treat eleven infected non-unions; eight patients achieved a good or excellent result. Dujardyn et al. [10] reported union in 27 of 28 patients managed with an Ilizarov frame and partial fibulectomy; they found smoking adversely affected healing time. In their paper, Brinker et al. [11] treated patients over 60  years of age with <b>circular</b> frame, achieving <b>union</b> in all 20 patients who completed treatment, with an improvement in quality of life equivalent to 5.3 quality-adjusted years. Rozbruch et al. treated 38 non-unions with a Taylor Spatial Frame achieving union in 27 patients; the remaining eleven required further procedures including 2 amputations. Good or excellent functional results were reported in 34 patients [12].|$|R
