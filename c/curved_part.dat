5|$|The {{scales are}} highly curved, which creates inter-scale reflection. This {{mechanism}} is unusual among Lepidoptera. The proximal {{part of each}} scale is almost flat; the scale then gradually curves up and then steeply bends down at the distal end, covering the proximal part of the next row of scales. Because of this shape, adjacent rows of scales have valley-like grooves between them. This allows light to strike one scale, reflect at a roughly 90° angle, strike the next scale, and be reflected away from the wing. Because the angle of each reflection is far from normal incidence, the interference effect favours reflection of different colours of light than are seen when light strikes {{near the top of}} the <b>curved</b> <b>part</b> of the scale.|$|E

30|$|Reinforced soil {{retaining}} walls {{are widely used}} for road and railway construction, various types of embankment, housing and industrial development, etc. with good safety and economic efficiency, {{and the number of}} studies on reinforced soil {{retaining walls}} has steadily increased. However, most research on reinforced soil retaining walls focus on two-dimensional linear parts. The behaviour of <b>curved</b> <b>parts</b> in reinforced soil retaining wall is questionable, and collapse of that also occurs frequently. Therefore, in this study, reinforced soil retaining walls were modelled by stacking blocks of 0.4 [*]×[*] 0.5 [*]×[*] 0.4  m (length[*]×[*]width[*]×[*]height), and the retaining walls were divided into four cases (heights of 3.2, 5.2, 7.2, 9.2  m). The failure behavior of the straight <b>parts</b> and the <b>curved</b> <b>parts</b> were compared, depending on the height. Based on the height of the reinforced soil retaining wall, the failure behaviours of the <b>curved</b> <b>parts</b> and straight parts of the reinforced soil retaining wall were predicted through 3 D numerical analysis. This study aims to raise the necessity of research on the <b>curved</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The golden {{trevally}} {{is a relatively}} large fish, growing to a maximum recorded size of 120cm in length and 15.0 kg in weight. It is similar to most other trevallies and jacks in having a compressed, oblong body, with the dorsal profile slightly more [...] than the ventral profile, particularly anteriorly. The species' mouth {{is one of its}} defining features; the mouth is highly protractile and fleshy, with specimens greater than 90mm having no teeth on the jaws, vomer or tongue. Smaller individuals have a series of small villiform teeth in both jaws. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first with 7 spines, the second with 1 spine and 18 to 20 soft rays. The anal fin has 2 detached spines followed by 1 spine and 15 to 17 soft rays, while the pelvic fin consists of 1 spine and 19 to 20 soft rays. The <b>curved</b> <b>part</b> of the lateral line is moderately arched; containing 62 to 73 scales, and approximately equal in length to the straight section containing 15 to 27 scales and 18 to 25 scutes. The breast is completely scaled. There are 27 to 30 gill rakers and 24 vertebrae in total.|$|E
2500|$|The porch's {{entrance}} arch {{is of the}} [...] "basket handle" [...] type ("anse de panier") and {{the external}} voussure immediately around {{the rim of the}} arch is decorated with vine leaves and grapes and small carvings of people eating grapes or at play and some dogs and a bird. These carvings start on the left side emerging from the mouth of a lion and end on the right side entering the mouth of a dragon. Around the interior voussure the same themes are repeated but a pig replaces the dragon. Above this arch a large tympanum contains what is left of a nativity scene with the Virgin Mary and Joseph, who have lost their heads, {{on either side of the}} baby Jesus, and the protruding heads of the ass and the cow. Around the central arch of the entrance, a further two bands of voussures and piédroits are elaborately decorated with scenes from both Old and New Testament. [...] The piédroit is the stone at the bottom part of an arch up to the point when the arch begins to curve. The stones in the <b>curved</b> <b>part</b> of the arch are called voussures. The nine biblical scenes involves are thought to have been inspired by the Maître de Folgoët's porch at La Martyre. They start on the lower left side with the temptation of Eve, and we then move over to the right side and see an angel armed with a sword chasing Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. We continue to move from left to right and see Eve carrying the baby Abel in her arms whilst the baby Cain sleeps in a cot at her feet and then Adam at work in the fields. We next move to a scene showing Cain and Abel making their sacrifices. On the left Cain is not having great success and the smoke from his fire billows back into his eyes. His brother is having more success. We move next to a scene showing Cain murdering his brother. Next we see Noah's ark and Noah harvesting grapes and then fast a sleep having drunk too much wine. In the final scene from this sequence we see Cham trying to cover his father's nudity. After these biblical scenes there are depictions of the four Evangelists and their attributes. Mark and John are on the left and Luke and Matthew on the right. Finally the carvings are of a [...] "heavenly" [...] host of angels singing, praying and playing instruments; a celebration of the birth of Christ! Inside the porch the statues of the apostles are not by the Prigent atelier but the canopy is. There are also works by the Prigent atelier in niches in the buttress supporting the porch. A statue of Saint Anne teaching the Virgin Mary to read can be found in the right side niche of the right side buttress, a statue of Saint Suzanne can be found in the niche in the centre of the right side buttress and in a niche in the left side buttress is a statue of the Virgin Mary. By the west wall in the south transept there are the remains of a statue of Saint Sebastian attributed to the Prigent atelier and on the lawn a kneeling Mary Magdalene is by Bastien Prigent.|$|E
60|$|They then {{proceeded}} to make a fire, and cook our evening meal. A light was procured by rubbing a blunt pointed stick in a groove made in another, as if with intention of deepening it, until by the friction the dust became ignited. A peculiarly white and very light wood (the Hibiscus tiliaceus) is alone used for this purpose: {{it is the same}} which serves for poles to carry any burden, and for the floating out-riggers to their canoes. The fire was produced in a few seconds: but to a person who does not understand the art, it requires, as I found, the greatest exertion; but at last, to my great pride, I succeeded in igniting the dust. The Gaucho in the Pampas uses a different method: taking an elastic stick about eighteen inches long, he presses one end on his breast, and the other pointed end into a hole in a piece of wood, and then rapidly turns the <b>curved</b> <b>part</b> like a carpenter's centre-bit. The Tahitians having made a small fire of sticks, placed a score of stones of about the size of cricket-balls, on the burning wood. In about ten minutes the sticks were consumed, and the stones hot. They had previously folded up in small parcels of leaves, pieces of beef, fish, ripe and unripe bananas, and the tops of the wild arum. These green parcels were laid in a layer between two layers of the hot stones, and the whole then covered up with earth, so that no smoke or steam could escape. In about {{a quarter of an hour}} the whole was most deliciously cooked. The choice green parcels were now laid on a cloth of banana leaves, and with a cocoa-nut shell we drank the cool water of the running stream; and thus we enjoyed our rustic meal.|$|E
30|$|Performance {{of chairs}} can be {{clarified}} by {{the behavior of}} component parts. In addition, loading type is effective {{on the behavior of}} component parts. In this study, chairs are made from straight and <b>curved</b> <b>parts.</b> In practice, chairs with <b>curved</b> <b>parts</b> are under tension or compression load. Various failure modes of <b>curved</b> <b>parts</b> were different between tension load and compression load. Compression loads are applied to entirely curved frame of one-piece type (b) when the chairs are subjected to the top to down load or the front to back load. Tension failure locations of curved frame have occurred in the bottom. But shear failure modes appeared in curved frame of two-piece type (a) when the chairs are subjected to the front to back load. Two <b>curved</b> dimensional <b>parts</b> were separated under tension load. The shear failure locations of curved frame were found in the front-curved legs. The various failure modes of <b>curved</b> <b>parts</b> are shown in Fig.  13. Since performance of chairs is similar to curved samples, and these properties are known in the initial step of the study and step of performance test of chairs, the first step in this study was performed to identify the behavior of component parts in the chairs.|$|R

30|$|Figure 9 a explores {{that the}} {{electric}} {{field on the}} <b>curving</b> <b>part</b> of the free surface was very heterogeneous and high, suggesting that those sites should be more efficient to self-generate jets. And {{the edge of the}} solution reservoir had much higher electric field intensity than the free surface due to metal materials of the reservoir. As shown in Fig. 2, a number of jets initiated around the <b>curving</b> <b>part</b> of free surface. And the higher electric field intensity around the edge rather than the surface could be the main reason that jets generated firstly {{from the edge of the}} solution reservoir. However, multiple jets were generated from the bubbles, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 9 b reveals that the bubbles had lower electric field intensity than the <b>curving</b> <b>part</b> of the free surface. Since the electrostatic force was the main driving force to accelerate the movement of the jets, the jets would travel faster under a higher electric field. Therefore, the higher electric field on the <b>curving</b> <b>part</b> of the free surface than the bubbles could be the main reason that the generated bubbles would increase the nanofiber diameter and decrease the nanofiber production. The theoretical analysis results were in good agreement with the experimental results.|$|R

40|$|Fused {{deposition}} modeling (FDM), {{as one of}} the {{additive manufacturing}} (AM) techniques, has been widely used in the manufacturing industry from the 1990 s. It is relatively cheaper than other AM methods and there are other advantages such as being able to process a variety of other polymers. Currently, FDM {{is more likely to be}} suitable for direct production of the terminal-use parts, in some cases challenging traditional process such as injection molding. Research evidences indicate that change of road and layer structure would have significant influence on the meso-structure and thus impact the mechanical properties of the resulting polymer parts. Adaptive flat layer deposition and curved layer deposition have been introduced to improve the mechanical properties of terminal-use product. It is necessary that an appropriate deposition scheme is essential to ensure the best interroad and inter-layer connectivity. Uninterrupted connections are likely to result in a continuous network of polymer chains, as in the case of the conventional processes. The current research proposes conventional flat layer deposition, adaptive flat layer deposition and curved layer deposition for FDM. In particular for <b>curved</b> <b>parts,</b> <b>curved</b> layer deposition in expected to ensure fiber continuity and better meso-structure.
