40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare / calculates how much the fare should have been given thehospital to inpatients based {{variable}} costing method at the rates stipulated in advance by thehospital. This study uses comparative descriptive analysis that illustrates the calculation of the cost ofexisting inpatient rooms in the hospital and then compare it to the calculation of the cost by usingvariable costing. The results of the study, according to calculations based on the variable costing, thecost of room per person per day inpatient rooms VIP Rp. 385 668 first class rooms Rp. Room 246391 Class II Rp. And room 192 152 Class III Rp. 126 243 while the tariffs set by the hospital to havea difference with that examined by the authors through <b>coting</b> variable method.

40|$|Aim {{for this}} {{research}} are to analyze capacity cost which incure from company production machines and human resources whose operate the production machine using CAM-I capacity model. CAM-I capacity model is an approach which focusÂ  upon how to manage company resources. This research initiated at PT X which focus to production activity that used small mixer machine, extruder machine, oven drying machine, enrober machine, pan <b>coting</b> machine which consist of hot and cold pan coating machine, and packing machine which consist of vertical packing machine and horizontal packing machine as well as human resources that operates those machine. This research focus on rate capacity, productive capacity, idle capacity, and nonproductive capacity to measure capacity cost. Result of this research shows most of the capacity owned by either by production machine or human resources are not utilized to its maximum potential. There are need to reduce capacity cost owned by production machine and human resoures to increase the product sales but if its unachieveable there will be need to increase efficiency from production machine and human resources by reducing their quantity DOI: 10. 15408 /ess. v 4 i 1. 1961 </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this work, nanostructured {{titanium}} dioxide (TiO) thin films {{have been prepared}} on glass substrates 2 using a facile layer-by-layer dip-coating method. The nano-layer surface was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. It was observed that degradation of Acid Red 14 (AR 14) depend on several parameters such as pH, the <b>coting</b> of silver and dipping times. In addition, TiO from 2 TiO /Ag demonstrated photocatalysis performance when irradiated and the Ag carrier further showed an 2 electron-scavenging ability to mitigate electron-hole pair recombination, which can improve the photocatalytic efficacy. With the oxidization and electron-scavenging ability of Ag and the photocatalysis ability of TiO, 2 TiO /Ag can decolor AR 14 more efficiently than TiO. 2 2 Key words: Titanium dioxide Silver Electron-Scavenging Photocatalysis Decolorization INTRODUCTION microorganisms [8], herbicides [9] {{and a variety of}} organic With increasing environment protection awareness formation of electron-hole pairs which may be activated in recent years, environment pollution issues have with wavelengths shorter than 380 nm. Therefore, many become major concerns; among these issues, wastewater efforts have been made to enhance the activation of TiO color is very important. Besides causing color at wavelengths closer to those of visible light. Thes...|$|E
