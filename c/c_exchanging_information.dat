40|$|Carbon {{emissions}} as {{a result}} of anthropogenic land use have drastically altered the global C cycle. Analyses reported that land use change has released 156 Pg C from vegetation and soils to the atmosphere in the period 1850 - 2000, equivalent to c. 50 % of fossil fuel emissions. More recently, longer-term analysis of human-induced land cover change have highlighted the importance of past land use changes, with estimates of pre-industrial Holocene carbon emissions ranging between 50 and 357 Pg C. Current global vegetation models represent well the net terrestrial <b>C</b> <b>exchange</b> from both vegetation and soils accompanying land use change. In contrast, <b>C</b> <b>exchange</b> associated with accelerated soil erosion following the conversion of land to agricultural use is not accounted for. Large amounts of C have been exposed to mineralization and burial {{as a result}} of agricultural erosion and deposition but its significance for both current and past fluxes of carbon due to changes in land use remains poorly quantified. Here, we present an overview of the key controls on soil erosion-induced changes in <b>C</b> <b>exchange</b> between the soil and the atmosphere. We provide evidence of how erosion processes increase the stabilization potential of soils by advecting mineral surfaces through the soil column. Accelerated erosion provides fresh mineral surfaces to the biologically active soil layer where it can stabilize organic matter inputs from plants at sites of erosion. In combination with the deep burial of allochthonous and autochtonous carbon and the inhibited decomposition upon burial, this acts as a sink mechanism. The conditions under which accelerated erosion leads to the chemical and physical breakdown of soil and a biomass reduction following soil degradation, resulting in a net source are also identified. We also present the integrated biotic flux of carbon for the Holocene {{as a result of}} both anthropogenic land use change and accelerated erosion for a large coupled upland-colluvial-floodplain system in Belgium. We quantify the spatial and temporal dynamics of sediment and carbon sources and sink using evidence from soil truncation studies, radiocarbon dating and soil databases in combination with soil-vegetation models. Based on this assessment, we discuss the uncertainties surrounding net <b>C</b> <b>exchange</b> and <b>information</b> gaps that hamper the quantification of the linkages between accelerated erosion and the C cycle in a temporal framework. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} a {{recently}} started PhD project in which we investigate {{the extension of the}} concept of “Building Information Model” (BIM) to the domain of landscape design. The potential benefits of BIM in the field of architecture have been reported many times (e. g., Ibrahim et al., 2004; Eastman et al., 2008; Abdelmohsen et al., 2011). However, in landscape design an information model in the way of BIM seems to be missing. Benefits of a Landscape Information Model would be (a) formalisation of knowledge in landscape design; (b) information model to support multiple participants in landscape design; (<b>c)</b> improved <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> between landscape design, architecture, and urban design.

40|$|Abstract Background Medication {{incident}} reporting (MIR) {{is a key}} safety critical care process in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). Retrospective studies of medication incident reports in aged care have identified the inability of existing MIR processes to generate {{information that can be}} used to enhance residents’ safety. However, there is little existing research that investigates the limitations of the existing <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> process that underpins MIR, despite the considerable resources that RACFs’ devote to the MIR process. The aim of this study was to undertake an in-depth exploration of the <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> process involved in MIR and identify factors that inhibit the collection of meaningful information in RACFs. Methods The study was undertaken in three RACFs (part of a large non-profit organisation) in NSW, Australia. A total of 23 semi-structured interviews and 62 hours of observation sessions were conducted between May to July 2011. The qualitative data was iteratively analysed using a grounded theory approach. Results The findings highlight significant gaps in the design of the MIR artefacts as well as <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> issues in MIR process execution. Study results emphasized the need to: a) design MIR artefacts that facilitate identification of the root causes of medication incidents, b) integrate the MIR process within existing information systems to overcome key gaps in <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> execution, and <b>c)</b> support <b>exchange</b> of <b>information</b> that can facilitate a multi-disciplinary approach to medication incident management in RACFs. Conclusions This study highlights the advantages of viewing MIR process holistically rather than as segregated tasks, as a means to identify gaps in <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> that need to be addressed in practice to improve safety critical processes. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{new class}} of {{inorganic}} ion exchange material called crystalline silicotitanates (CST) has been developed for radioactive waste treatment in a collaborative effort between Sandia National Laboratories and Texas A&M University. The Sandia National Laboratories Laboratory Directed Research and Development program provided the initial funding for this effort and this report summarizes the rapid progress that was achieved. A wide range of compositions were synthesized, evaluated for cesium (Cs) removal efficiency, and a composition called TAM- 5 was developed that exhibits high selectivity and affinity for Cs and strontium (Sr). Tests show it can remove parts per million concentrations of Cs{sup +} from highly alkaline, high-sodium, simulated radioactive waste solutions modeled after those at Hanford, Oak Ridge, and Savannah River. In experiments with solutions that simulate highly alkaline Hanford defense wastes, the crystalline silicotitanates exhibit distribution coefficients for Cs{sup +} of greater than 2, 000 ml/g, and distribution coefficients greater than 10, 000 ml/g for solutions adjusted to a pH between 1 and 10. In addition, the CSTs were found to exhibit distribution coefficients for Sr{sup +} greater than 100, 000 ml/g and for plutonium of 2, 000 ml/g from simulated Hanford waste. The CST crystal structure was determined and positions of individual atoms identified using x-ray and neutron diffraction. The structural information has permitted identification of the ion exchange sites and provided insights into the strong effect of pH on <b>Cs</b> ion <b>exchange.</b> <b>Information</b> on the synthesis, composition, and structure of CST is considered proprietary and is not discussed in this report...|$|R

40|$|Online social {{networking}} sites like MySpace, Facebook, and Flickr have become a popular way to share and disseminate content. Their massive popularity has led to viral marketing techniques that attempt to spread content, products, and ideas on these sites. However, there is little data publicly available on viral propagation {{in the real world}} and few studies have characterized how information spreads over current online social networks. In this paper, we collect and analyze large-scale traces of information dissemination in the Flickr social network. Our analysis, based on crawls of the favorite markings of 2. 5 million users on 11 million photos, aims at answering three key questions: (a) how widely does information propagate in the social network? (b) how quickly does information propagate? and (c) {{what is the role of}} word-of-mouth exchanges between friends in the overall propagation of information in the network? Contrary to viral marketing “intuition, ” we find that (a) even popular photos do not spread widely throughout the network, (b) even popular photos spread slowly through the network, and (<b>c)</b> <b>information</b> <b>exchanged</b> between friends is likely to account for over 50 % of all favoritemarkings, but with a significant delay at each hop...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effects of {{operational}} and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> on supply chain performance and the moderating role of information quality in relation to both operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> The study was conducted using manufacturing companies located in the Northern region of Malaysia. Hierarchical multiple regressions were applied to test the hypotheses developed for the study. It was found that operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is significantly related to supply chain performance. The impact of strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is greater as opposed to operational <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> <b>Information</b> quality does not moderate the relationship between both operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and supply chain performance. Nonetheless, this study provides evidence that both strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and operational <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> are required to enhance supply chain performance. As such supply chain partners should effectively <b>exchange</b> strategic <b>information</b> as the impact is greater on performance. <b>Information</b> <b>exchange,</b> <b>information</b> quality, operational information, strategic information, supply chain, performance...|$|R
