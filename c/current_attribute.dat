In this paper, the equivalence between two kinds of <b>current</b> <b>attribute</b> reduction models in BRSM for binary decision problems is proved. Furthermore, binary decision problems are extended to multi-decision problems in BRSM. Some monotonic measures of approximation quality for multi-decision problems are presented, with which attribute reduction models for multi-decision problems can be suitably constructed. What is more, the discernibility matrices associated with attribute reduction for binary decision and multi-decision problems are proposed, respectively. Based on them, the approaches to knowledge reduction in BRSM can be obtained which corresponds well to the original rough set methodology...|$|E
40|$|Quality {{web service}} {{discovery}} requires narrowing the search space from an overwhelming set of services {{down to the}} most relevant ones, while matching the consumer’s request. Today, the ranking of services only considers static attributes or snapshots of <b>current</b> <b>attribute</b> values, resulting in low-quality search results. To satisfy the user’s need for timely, well-chosen web services, we ought to consider quality of service attributes. The problem is that dynamic attributes {{can be difficult to}} measure, frequently fluctuate, are context-sensitive and depend on environmental factors, such as network availability at query time. In this paper, we propose the Dynamis algorithm to address these challenges effectively. Dynamis is based on well-established database techniques, such as skyline and aggregation. We illustrate our approach using observatory telescope web services and experimentally evaluate it using stock market data. In our evaluation, we show significant improvement in service selection over existing techniques...|$|E
40|$|Exploitation {{characteristics}} behaves as a decreasing valors factor (DVF) {{which can}} be connected with degradation processes. It is a structure that consists of independent attributes which represent situations generally connected with a given exploitation factor. The multi-attribute structure contains attributes directly and indirectly referring to the main factor. Attribute states, by definition, can only maintain or decrease their values. Such situations are met in security, reliability, exploitation, fatigues and many complex one-directed or irreversible processes. The main goal refers to protocol security analysis during {{the realization of the}} communication run that specifies the assessment of the level of current and oncoming threats connected with cryptography authentication. In the communication run, the operations of different protocols mutually interleave. Our concept is based on the algorithm of attributes correction during exploitation process realization (Blanchet et al., 2008). The monitoring and correcting procedures make it possible to provide forecast information about possible threats {{on the basis of the}} structure of the <b>current</b> <b>attribute</b> values...|$|E

40|$|The quality {{assurance}} of timber properties {{is important for}} the safety of timber structures. In the current study, the quality control options of timber are analysed under the prism of the different growth regions. Therefore, these options - machine and output control - are simulated in accordance with EN 14081, and the performance is assessed and compared using 279, 000 timber pieces from a production facility. For the data with only grading information available, the real properties were simulated based on 4, 158 specimens for which destructive test results are also available. The results indicate that timber with desired property values can be produced by both machine and output control. In direct comparison to machine control, the output control delivers timber which matches the requirements more frequently as quality shifts can be detected. Whenever lower timber quality is identified, the settings are increased. The output control system for multiple growth regions is not sensitive enough when the <b>current</b> <b>attribute</b> chart given in EN 14081 - 3 is used.

40|$|Current {{state-of-the-art}} {{systems for}} visual content anal-ysis require large training sets for each class of interest, and performance degrades rapidly with fewer examples. In this paper, {{we present a}} general framework for the zero-shot learning problem of performing high-level event de-tection with no training exemplars, using only textual de-scriptions. This task goes beyond the traditional zero-shot framework of adapting a given set of classes with training data to unseen classes. We leverage video and image collec-tions with free-form text descriptions from widely available web sources to learn a large bank of concepts, in addition to using several off-the-shelf concept detectors, speech, and video text for representing videos. We utilize natural lan-guage processing technologies to generate event descrip-tion features. The extracted features are then projected to a common high-dimensional space using text expansion, and similarity is computed in this space.

40|$|Subjective Logic (SL) {{is a type}} of {{probabilistic}} logic, {{which is}} suitable for reasoning about situations with uncertainty and incomplete knowledge. In recent years, SL has drawn a significant amount of attention from the multi-agent systems community as it connects beliefs and uncertainty in propositions to a rigorous statistical characterization via Dirichlet distributions. However, one serious limitation of SL is that the belief updates are done only based on completely observable evidence. This work extends SL to incorporate belief updates from partially observable evidence. Normally, the belief updates in SL presume that the current evidence for a proposition points to only one of its mutually exclusive attribute states. Instead, this work considers that the <b>current</b> <b>attribute</b> state may not be completely observable, and instead, one is only able to obtain a measurement that is statistically related to this state. In other words, the SL belief is updated based upon the likelihood that one of the attributes was observed. The paper then illustrates properties of the partial observable updates {{as a function of the}} state likelihood and illustrates the use of these likelihoods for a trust estimation application. Finally, the utility of the partial observable updates is demonstrated via various simulations including the trust estimation case. U. S. Army Research Laboratory; U. K.

40|$|Plagiarism in {{connection}} with computer programming education is a serious problem. This problem is common to many universities around the world, and the University of Oslo (UoO) makes no exception. The major problem is that students plagiarize homework programming assignments written by fellow students. To deal with this situation plagiarism detection software has been developed to assess the similarity between program listings. Such software is exposed to {{the daunting task of}} minimizing the numbers of false negatives and false positives at the same time, i. e. finding the highest number of copies while avoiding those which are not. UoO uses a distributed system for delivering such assignments, called Joly. This system compares program listings by using an attribute counting metric. This is a very general metric and here I investigate whether a less general-purpose metric tuned to the particularities of programming code may perform better than the one currently being used in Joly. To this end I have developed two new structure based similarity measures which quantify the structural similarity between abstract syntax trees (AST). More specifically, I have (i) modified the standard AST representation to ease the comparison between trees, (ii) identified the most common cheating strategies employed by students, (iii) assessed the changes these strategies have on the AST structures, (iv) developed and implemented two new AST similarity measuring algorithms, ASTSIM-NWand ASTSIM-LCS, focused on uncovering plagiarism based on the most common cheating strategies leaving the most distinct AST footprints, and (v) compared the performance of the two new algorithms relative to the one being currently used in Joly. Even though the test results need to be interpreted with caution, the combined use of the two new algorithms appears to perform better in terms of false negatives and false positives. This suggests that they should be considered as candidates for complementing the <b>current</b> <b>attribute</b> counting approach in Joly and thus be exposed to more extensive testing and polishing...|$|E
