5|$|Henrietta Lacks (born Loretta Pleasant; August 1, 1920 – October 4, 1951) was an African American {{woman whose}} cancer cells {{are the source}} of the HeLa cell line, the first immortalized cell line {{and one of the most}} {{important}} cell lines in medical research. An immortalized cell line will reproduce indefinitely under specific conditions, and the HeLa cell line continues to be a source of invaluable medical data to the present day. As was then the practice, no <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> to culture her cells, nor were she or her family compensated for their extraction or use.|$|E
25|$|Motorbuses were {{considered}} {{as an alternative}} to the proposed tramways to Beeston and Hucknall and powers for these two routes were granted under Section 18 of the 1920 Act. This Act further enabled the Corporation to run motorbuses on any route outside the city, provided that <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> from the Minister of Transport and the local authority concerned. The first vehicles inaugurated a service to Bagthorpe, from the Bulwell tramway at its junction with the Lenton service at Bentinck Road, Radford, on 17 May, operating via Gregory Boulevard; it thus provided a link between Mansfield Road and Alfreton Road, broken since the withdrawal of the Forest Road horse-tram service.|$|E
25|$|Geoffrey was {{the elder}} son of Foulques V d'Anjou and Eremburga de La Flèche, {{daughter}} of Elias I of Maine. He {{was named after}} his great-grandfather Geoffrey II, Count of Gâtinais. Geoffrey received his nickname from the yellow sprig of broom blossom (genêt is the French name for the planta genista, or broom shrub) he wore in his hat. King Henry I of England, having heard good reports on Geoffrey's talents and prowess, sent his royal legates to Anjou to negotiate a marriage between Geoffrey and his own daughter, Empress Matilda. <b>Consent</b> <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> from both parties, and on 10 June 1128 the fifteen-year-old Geoffrey was knighted in Rouen by King Henry {{in preparation for the}} wedding.|$|E

500|$|The Indian parent {{may also}} {{withdraw}} their consent to an adoption {{at any time}} prior to a final order, or within {{two years of the}} final order if their <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> through fraud or under duress.

2500|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Act, mental {{hospital}} inmates could only be discharged with the approval of the medical superintendent, and it was within the superintendent’s power to force examination by the Eugenics Board. [...] If in unanimous agreement, the Board was empowered to appoint a physician and direct sterilization. [...] Such operations were not to be performed unless <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> from the inmate, if competent, or consent from a spouse, parent, guardian or Minister of Health if considered incompetent.|$|E

60|$|To {{carry out}} his plan, indeed, it would be {{necessary}} to break the entail twice; once formally, and once again really. He must begin by getting Granville's consent to the proposed arrangement, so as to raise ready money with which to bribe the young men; and as soon as Granville's <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> <b>obtained,</b> he must put it plainly to Guy and Cyril, as an anonymous benefactor, that if they would consent to accept a fixed sum in lieu of all contingencies, then the secret of their birth would be revealed to them at last, and they would be asked to break the entail on the estates as eldest sons of a gentleman of property.|$|E
60|$|His feudal lord {{the king}} of France was bound by his most obvious {{interests}} to oppose the further aggrandisement of one already too potent for a vassal; but {{the king of}} France was then a minor; and Baldwin, earl of Flanders, whose daughter William had married, was regent of the kingdom. This circumstance rendered the remonstrance of the French council against his design of no effect; indeed the opposition of the council itself was faint; {{the idea of having}} a king under vassalage to their crown might have dazzled the more superficial courtiers; whilst those, who thought more deeply, were unwilling to discourage an enterprise, which they believed would probably end in the ruin of the undertaker. The emperor was in his minority, as well as the king of France; but by what arts the duke prevailed upon the imperial council to declare in his favour, whether or no by an idea of creating a balance to the power of France, if we can imagine that any such idea then subsisted, is altogether uncertain; but it is certain, that he obtained leave for the vassals of the empire to engage in his service, and that he made use of this permission. The pope's <b>consent</b> <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> with still less difficulty. William had shown himself in many instances a friend to the church, and a favourer of the clergy. On this occasion he promised to improve those happy beginnings in proportion to the means he should acquire by the favour of the Holy See. It is said that he even proposed to hold his new kingdom as a fief from Rome. The pope, therefore, entered heartily into his interests; he excommunicated all those that should oppose his enterprise, and sent him, as a means of ensuring success, a consecrated banner.|$|E
