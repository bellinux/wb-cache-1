5000|$|The cutters {{most often}} used to cut spotfaces are {{counterbore}} cutters and endmills. In manual machining especially, the former is useful because its pilot guides the cutter into the correct location (established by the bolt hole), and its cutting lips are perpendicular to the hole axis with no relief angle, meaning that a plunging cut, moving in only the Z-axis, will leave a flat surface. In contrast, most general-purpose endmills have a relief angle such that a plunging cut (Z-axis-only toolpath) will leave a very slightly convex surface. But in CNC machining this is irrelevant, because the flat spotface is left by <b>circular</b> <b>interpolation</b> of the endmill as it traces a circular toolpath in the XY plane. Zero-angle cutters obviate this, functioning similarly to the traditional counterbore cutters of manual machining but needing no pilot. Spot facing of larger planar surfaces sometimes employs face mills.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{existing}} accuracy {{test standard}} for machining centers (ISO 10791) is being revised {{in order to}} add a test method for five-axis machining centers. In the revised part of the standard (ISO 10791 - 6), simultaneous three-axis interpolation motion accuracy tests for two linear axes and one rotary axis are proposed as an interpolation accuracy test for five-axis machining centers. These tests enable the measurement of the motion error in three directions, e. g., X, Y, and Z. Two devices {{can be used as}} the measurement instrument in these tests. One is a ball bar device, and the other is a combination of a ball and a displacement sensor. An R-test device that incorporates three displacement sensors has been designed for the latter. Using the ball bar device, measurement in three directions can be performed independently, and the radii of <b>circular</b> <b>interpolations</b> for each measurement are different. Using the R-test device, time is shortened by measuring three measurement directions at once, and the acquired data can be analyzed in various ways. The original goal of the measurement method using the R-test device was to measure the dynamic accuracy of the rotary axes. In the present study, the R-test device was actually prototyped and several machines were measured. In addition to the dynamic error of the rotary axes, incorrect pitch error compensation settings for the numerical controller, straightness, or squareness of the linear axes can be well detected...|$|R

40|$|Interpolation {{technology}} {{is the core of}} the computer numerical control (CNC) system, and the precision and stability of the interpolation algorithm directly affect the machining precision and speed of CNC system. Most of the existing numerical control interpolation technology can only achieve <b>circular</b> arc <b>interpolation,</b> linear interpolation or parabola interpolation, but for the numerical control (NC) machining of parts with complicated surface, it needs to establish the mathematical model and generate the curved line and curved surface outline of parts and then discrete the generated parts outline into a large amount of straight line or arc to carry on the processing, which creates the complex program and a large amount of code, so it inevitably introduce into the approximation error. All these factors affect the machining accuracy, surface roughness and machining efficiency. The stepless interpolation of cubic Bezier curve controlled by analog signal is studied in this paper, the tool motion trajectory of Bezier curve can be directly planned out in CNC system by adjusting control points, and then these data were put into the control motor which can complete the precise feeding of Bezier curve.
