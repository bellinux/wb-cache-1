40|$|Spatial {{interpolation}} {{methods are}} widely used in various fields and have been studied by several scholars with {{one or a few}} specific sampling datasets that do not reflect the complexity of the spatial characteristics and lead to conclusions that cannot be widely applied. In this paper, three factors that affect the accuracy of interpolation have been considered, i. e., sampling density, sampling mode, and sampling location. We studied the inverse distance weighted (IDW), regular spline (RS), and ordinary kriging (OK) interpolation methods using 162 DEM datasets considering six sampling densities, nine terrain complexities, and three sampling modes. The experimental results show that, in selective sampling and <b>combined</b> <b>sampling,</b> the maximum absolute errors of interpolation methods rapidly increase and the estimated values are overestimated. In regular-grid sampling, the RS method has the highest interpolation accuracy, and IDW has the lowest interpolation accuracy. However, in both selective and <b>combined</b> <b>sampling,</b> the accuracy of the IDW method is significantly improved and the RS method performs worse. The OK method does not significantly change between the three sampling modes. The following conclusion can be obtained from the above analysis: the <b>combined</b> <b>sampling</b> mode is recommended for sampling, and more sampling points should be added in the ridges, valleys, and other complex terrain. The IDW method should not be used in the regular-grid sampling mode, but it has good performance in the selective sampling mode and <b>combined</b> <b>sampling</b> mode. However, the RS method shows the opposite phenomenon. The sampling dataset should be analyzed before using the OK method, which can select suitable models based on the analysis results of the sampling dataset...|$|E

40|$|A general {{expression}} for the distortion rate function (DRF) of cyclostationary Gaussian processes {{in terms of}} their spectral properties is derived. This expression {{can be seen as the}} result of orthogonalization over the different components in the polyphase decomposition of the process. We use this expression to derive, in a closed form, the DRF of several cyclostationary processes arising in practice. We first consider the DRF of a <b>combined</b> <b>sampling</b> and source coding problem. It is known that the optimal coding strategy for this problem involves source coding applied to a signal with the same structure as one resulting from pulse amplitude modulation (PAM). Since a PAM-modulated signal is cyclostationary, our DRF expression can be used to solve for the minimal distortion in the <b>combined</b> <b>sampling</b> and source coding problem. We also analyze in more detail the DRF of a source with the same structure as a PAM-modulated signal, and show that it is obtained by reverse waterfilling over an expression that depends on the energy of the pulse and the baseband process modulated to obtain the PAM signal. This result is then used to study the information content of a PAM-modulated signal as a function of its symbol time relative to the bandwidth of the underlying baseband process. In addition, we also study the DRF of sources with an amplitude-modulation structure, and show that the DRF of a narrow-band Gaussian stationary process modulated by either a deterministic or a random phase sine-wave equals the DRF of the baseband process.

For extensive areas forest surveys cannot be realized as full tallies but have to utilize sampling approaches.

40|$|When {{assessing}} the species richness of a taxonomic {{group in a}} specific area, the choiceof sampling method is critical. In this study, the effectiveness of three methods for sampling syrphids(Diptera: Syrphidae) in tropical forests is compared: Malaise trapping, collecting adults with an entomological net, and collecting and rearing immatures. Surveys were made from 2008 to 2011 in six tropical forest sites in Costa Rica. The results revealed signiÞcant differences in the composition and richness of syrphid faunas obtained by each method. Collecting immatures was the most successful method based on numbers of species and individuals, whereas Malaise trapping was the least effective. This pattern of sampling effectiveness was independent of syrphid trophic or functional group and annual season. An advantage of collecting immatures over collecting adults is {{the quality and quantity}} of associated biological data obtained by the former method. However, complementarity between results of collecting adults and collecting immatures, showed that a <b>combined</b> <b>sampling</b> regime obtained the most complete inventory.

40|$|Airborne {{remote sensing}} at {{infrared}} wavelengths {{has the potential}} to quantify large-fire properties related to energy release or intensity, residence time, fuel-consumption rate, rate of spread, and soil heating. Remote sensing at a high temporal rate can track fire-line outbreaks and acceleration and spotting ahead of a fire front. Yet infrared imagers and imaging spectrometers typically used for earth remote sensing are saturated by—and incapable of measuring—the very bright infrared light that radiates from wildland fires. The Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Station, and its partners have addressed this problem by developing the FireMapper thermal-imaging radiometer for quantitative, high-resolution measurements of wildland fires. FireMapper has been applied to produce and disseminate accurate visualizations of large-fire activity, during active burning periods and for multiple fires, in near real-time. Practical extension of measurements by the FireMapper to prediction of fire behavior on time scales from hours to days requires highly resolved information on fuels and wind across landscapes and changes to the basic Rothermel formulation for fire spread. <b>Combined</b> <b>sampling</b> in the field and by multispectral remote sensing for the 2006 Esperanza Fire have demonstrated that the latter may provide an improved means for acquiring the needed fuels data...|$|E

Physical tagging is routinely conducted for domesticated animals (e. g. sheep and cattle); however, there are considerable logistical, animal welfare and economic issues that challenge the feasibility of physically tagging all farmed fish. A ‘DNA stand-by method’ for identification of escaped Atlantic salmon, back to the cage and farm of origin, was established at the Institute of Marine Research in Norway.

40|$|We have {{recently}} {{developed a new}} personal sampler and demonstrated its feasibility for detection of viable airborne microorganisms including bacteria, fungi and viruses. To accelerate the time-consuming analytical procedure involving 2 - 5 days of biological testing, we employed a real-time PCR protocol {{in conjunction with the}} personal sampler for collection of airborne viruses. The advantage of this approach is that if the presence of a particular pathogen in the air is detected by the PCR, the remaining collecting liquid can be further analysed by more time-consuming biological methods to estimate the number of airborne infectious/live microorganisms. As sampling of bioaerosols in natural environments is likely to be associated with substantial contamination by a range of microorganisms commonly existing in an ambient air, an investigation of the specificity of detection by targeted PCR analysis is required.

40|$|Three {{techniques}} for trapping saproxylic (dead wood associated) beetles are compared, {{based on a}} study in an old-growth Australian lowland tropical rainforest. Trunk window traps, which are small flight intercept traps mounted {{on the sides of}} dead trees, are the most efficient, and are highly recommended for studies where high between-trap variability is not a major concern. Ground-based flight intercept traps collect fewer species, and sample a different, perhaps less substrate-specific, set of species. They are, however, useful for between-site comparisons since they have lower between-trap variability. Both techniques are cheap and simple to operate. Log emergence traps are the least efficient and their cost in time, effort and expense is high. They do, however, sample a few cryptic species not readily sampled by other means. All three techniques would be desirable for a comprehensive survey, but given time/cost constraints, trunk window traps alone are recommended. Despite a <b>combined</b> <b>sampling</b> intensity in this study equivalent to 18 trap-years, the yield of 329 species from 59 traps may represent little {{more than half of the}} species potentially sampleable by these means.

40|$|A {{theory of}} {{minimizing}} distortion in reconstructing a stationary signal from its compressed samples {{at a given}} bitrate is developed. We first analyze the optimal sampling frequency {{required in order to}} achieve the optimal distortion-rate tradeoff for a stationary bandlimited signal. To this end, we consider a <b>combined</b> <b>sampling</b> and source coding problem in which an analog Gaussian source is reconstructed from its encoded samples. We study this problem under uniform filter-bank sampling and nonuniform sampling with time-varying pre-processing. We show that for processes whose energy is not uniformly distributed over their spectral support, each point on the distortion-rate curve of the process corresponds to a sampling frequency smaller than the Nyquist rate. This characterization can be seen {{as an extension of the}} classical sampling theorem for bandlimited random processes in the sense that it describes the minimal amount of excess distortion in the reconstruction due to lossy compression of the samples, and provides the minimal sampling frequency $f_{DR}$ required in order to achieve that distortion. We compare the fundamental limits of combined source coding and sampling, which we coin analog-to-digital compression, to the performance in pulse code modulation (PCM), where each sample is quantized by a scalar quantizer using a fixed number of bits.
