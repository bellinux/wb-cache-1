5|$|In February 2007, Wotton {{was granted}} a {{separate}} trial from his <b>co-accused</b> in the Brisbane District Court since the allegations in the prosecution case against the other <b>co-accused</b> were prejudicial to Wotton's case. Wotton then pleaded guilty {{to the charge of}} rioting. In late March, after Wotton had already applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the advice of his legal representatives (including his then barrister Marcus Einfeld), Wotton's <b>co-accused</b> were acquitted by a jury of rioting causing destruction. Wotton's application to withdraw his plea was granted by Nase DCJ on 26 April 2007. A few days later, Wotton was released on bail with strict conditions and ordered to return in April 2008 to be tried.|$|E
5|$|The LeT {{operative}} David Headley (born Daood Sayed Gilani) in {{his testimony}} before a Chicago federal court during <b>co-accused</b> Tahawwur Rana's trial revealed that Mumbai Chabad House {{was added to the}} list of targets for surveillance given by his Inter Services Intelligence handler Major Iqbal, though the Oberoi hotel, one of the sites attacked, was not originally on the list.|$|E
5|$|After escaping, Cornfoot {{made her}} way to the village of Leuchars, eight miles from Pittenweem, where she was either {{discovered}} by the minister, George Gordon, or had approached him for help. For the reward of £10, he arranged an armed guard of two men to return her to Cowper's house on 30 January 1705. Cowper was not at home when they arrived so she was taken to one of the bailies. A mob of at least ten people forcibly removed her from the house, tied her up, beat her, then hauled her down to the harbour by her ankles, possibly with the intention of dunking her. A rope was run from the top of the masthead on a ship back to the shore and she was dangled from it while the crowd threw stones at her as she swung backwards and forwards. When they took her down, she was covered by a door that had heavy stones placed on top of it until she was crushed to death. A cart pulled by a horse was guided over her corpse more than once to ensure she was dead. The crowd took her body to the home of her <b>co-accused,</b> Nicolas Lawson, with the intention of torturing her in the same manner but decided they had sufficient sport for the day.|$|E

25|$|Sharma was incarcerated in the Tihar Jail {{along with}} the <b>co-accused</b> Vikas Yadav and Amardeep Singh Gill, who had been sentenced for {{destroying}} evidence. Along with another high-profile convict, Santosh Kumar Singh, Sharma is involved in helping other prisoners draft legal appeals.|$|E
25|$|Following the judgment, Jayalalithaa {{was moved}} to Parappana Agrahara prison. Requests for a VVIP cell and medical {{treatment}} were denied. The three <b>co-accused</b> were also jailed at that prison. The four sought bail pending an appeal and this was granted on 17 October 2014. It was stipulated that the appeal must be completed within three months.|$|E
25|$|The trial {{took place}} in March 1918. The charges {{were based on a}} law of 5 August 1914 that {{prohibited}} publications that would give information to the enemy or would exercise a bad influence on the mind of the army and the people. Brion was <b>co-accused</b> with Mouflard, a soldier who was her godson and was suspected of having circulated pacifist propaganda at the front.|$|E
25|$|Revilla {{was first}} elected to the Senate in 2004, {{succeeding}} his father. He successfully ran {{for a second term}} and topped the senatorial race in 2010. His alleged involvement in the Napoles pork barrel scam led the Sandiganbayan to issue an arrest warrant against him and other <b>co-accused</b> on June 20, 2014. Within hours, Revilla surrendered before the anti-graft court. He is detained at Camp Crame.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 {{the lawyers}} of Bin al-Shibh {{argued that he}} may be unfit to stand trial and {{participate}} in his own defense. They have asked that the proceedings against him and his four <b>co-accused</b> be stayed until his mental state is determined. They say he has been prescribed psychotropic drugs of the sort that are used to treat schizophrenia. Bin al-Shibh claims that he is mentally fit, has denounced his lawyers, and says that he wants to represent himself before the commissions.|$|E
25|$|On 10 September 2009, the Allahabad {{high court}} acquitted Moninder Singh Pandher and {{overturned}} his death sentence. He was not named a main suspect by investigators initially, but was summoned as <b>co-accused</b> during the trial. Pandher faces trial in five cases {{out of the}} remaining 12, and could be re-sentenced to death if found guilty {{in any of those}} killings. The same day Pandher was acquitted, the Allahabad high court upheld the death sentence for Surinder Koli, the former domestic servant of Pandher.|$|E
25|$|On 27 September 2014, the Special Court convicted {{all four}} accused. Jayalalithaa {{was sentenced to}} four years simple {{imprisonment}} under the Prevention of Corruption Act and fined 100 crores, which would be set-off against the confiscated properties. The three <b>co-accused</b> were all sentenced to four years simple imprisonment and fined 10 crores each. Failure to pay the fine would result in an additional year of sentence. The outcome also meant that Jayalalithaa was disqualified as an MLA and as Chief Minister, {{and that she would}} not be able to contest elections for 10 years.|$|E
25|$|After {{twelve days}} of deliberation, on 13 July 2007, {{the jury found}} Black guilty of three counts of mail and wire fraud and one count of {{obstruction}} of justice and acquitted him of nine other charges, including wire fraud and racketeering. The fraud convictions related to money taken by the executives in exchange for their agreements to not compete with various Hollinger units. Prosecutors claimed these were fraudulent agreements. <b>Co-accused,</b> Peter Y. Atkinson, John A. Boultbee and Mark Kipnis, were each found guilty of mail and wire fraud (David Radler had already pleaded guilty to fraud).|$|E
25|$|On 1 May 2007, {{a series}} of raids—Operation Achilles—took place against SHAC in Europe, {{involving}} 700 police officers in England, Amsterdam, and Belgium. Thirty-two people were arrested, including Greg and Natasha Avery, and Heather Nicholson, who were charged with blackmail, along with nine others. The Averys pleaded guilty in July 2008, along with a <b>co-accused</b> Dan Amos. In October 2008 Trevor Holmes, Gerrah Selby, Daniel Wadham, Gavin Medd-Hall, and Heather Nicholson, who denied the charges, were sent to court. Prosecutors told jurors that a 2007 meeting between the defendants had been bugged by police, and revealed that SHAC supported illegal acts that were traced to attacks on people across Great Britain. The prosecution also alleged there was evidence of direct email links between SHAC, the Animal Liberation Front, and Animal Rights Militia. Holmes was acquitted but the other four were convicted.|$|E
25|$|Dragan Obrenovic {{was indicted}} by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague on 1 November 1998 for {{complicity}} in genocide, extermination, persecution, and {{two counts of}} murder. On 15 April 2001, he was arrested by SFOR personnel, and was transferred that same day to the Hague, he entered not-guilty pleas across the board at his arraignment on the 18th. On 20 May 2003, Obrenovic entered a plea agreement with the ICTY prosecutor's office. He pleaded guilty to one count of persecution, and in exchange for truthful allocation to {{his role in the}} Srebrenica Massacre and his testimony against his <b>co-accused</b> (his indictment was to be joined with that of four others on 27 May) he was promised a reduced sentence. On 10 December 2003, Obrenovic was sentenced to 17 years in prison, with 969 days credit for time served. He is currently serving out his sentence in Norway and will be eligible for release in April 2018.|$|E
25|$|The trial, {{which opened}} in February 2003, centred on whether Baker had {{been aware of the}} {{contents}} of the suitcase as well as an examination of the interrogation records and the confession he had signed. Baker claimed that the statement was mispresentation of his words and his lawyer, Shunji Miyake, argued that since there was no video or audio recording of the interrogations, and no defence lawyer was present, {{there was no way to}} check whether falsifications and mistranslations had taken place. Miyake also questioned what he claimed were the 'leading nature' of the questions asked by the interrogators. Baker maintained that the bag was Prunier's, that he had never had the key to the case, and that he had been tricked into carrying the bag by Prunier. Prunier had been arrested for drug smuggling in Belgium a month after Baker's arrest, and his <b>co-accused</b> in the Belgian case had also claimed that Prunier had duped them into carrying bags with drugs. The court ruled the evidence from the Belgian police was inadmissible, and it was not introduced during the trial.|$|E
500|$|The first hanging of a {{woman in}} Victoria, Elizabeth Scott, was {{performed}} in the prison on 11 November 1863 – along with her <b>co-accused,</b> Julian Cross and David Gedge. [...] The last person to be executed was Angus Murray in 1924, the same year the gaol was closed.|$|E
500|$|Although four of {{the accused}} denied {{involvement}} with MK, Mandela and the other five accused admitted sabotage but denied that they had ever agreed to initiate guerrilla war against the government. They used the trial to highlight their political cause; {{at the opening of}} the defence's proceedings, Mandela gave his three-hour [...] "I Am Prepared to Die" [...] speech. That speech—which was inspired by Castro's [...] "History Will Absolve Me"—was widely reported in the press despite official censorship. The trial gained international attention; there were global calls for the release of the accused from the United Nations and World Peace Council, while the University of London Union voted Mandela to its presidency. On 12 June 1964, justice De Wet found Mandela and two of his <b>co-accused</b> guilty on all four charges; although the prosecution had called for the death sentence to be applied, the judge instead condemned them to life imprisonment.|$|E
500|$|Mandela and his <b>co-accused</b> were {{transferred}} from Pretoria {{to the prison}} on Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years. Isolated from non-political prisoners in Section B, Mandela was imprisoned in a damp concrete cell measuring [...] by , with a straw mat on which to sleep. Verbally and physically harassed by several white prison wardens, the Rivonia Trial prisoners spent their days breaking rocks into gravel, until being reassigned in January 1965 {{to work in a}} lime quarry. Mandela was initially forbidden to wear sunglasses, and the glare from the lime permanently damaged his eyesight. At night, he worked on his LLB degree which he was obtaining from the University of London through a correspondence course with Wolsey Hall, Oxford, but newspapers were forbidden, and he was locked in solitary confinement on several occasions for the possession of smuggled news clippings. He was initially classified as the lowest grade of prisoner, Class D, meaning that he was permitted one visit and one letter every six months, although all mail was heavily censored.|$|E
500|$|Phát's lawyers {{started by}} {{asking for the}} charges against the conspirators to be dismissed, {{claiming}} the rebels had not been captured [...] "red-handed", but this request was denied. They were more successful in another demand, managing to persuade the five military judges to allow witnesses to be called. The court agreed to their request to compel Khánh, Kỳ and the civilian Deputy Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Oánh {{to appear before the}} hearing. The accused officers claimed to have only intended to make a show of force, rather than overthrow Khánh. Đức claimed that the objective of his actions was to [...] "emphasize my ideas" [...] and said his actions did not constitute a coup attempt. Đức said that if he was intending to overthrow the government, he would have arrested public servants or military officials and denied having done so. On the other hand, he also admitted to being concerned by Khánh's policies. Đức said he had decided to end what he regarded as a military protest demonstration when Khánh promised to consider his concerns, and then returned to the IV Corps headquarters in the Mekong Delta. He claimed responsibility for the actions of his subordinate and <b>co-accused,</b> Colonel Ton, who led the 7th Division of IV Corps into Saigon. Ton agreed that Đức had ordered him to move his troops into the capital. During questioning, Đức did not refer to his coup partner Phát.|$|E
500|$|In July 1849, the South Australian Advocate General {{produced}} {{a summary of}} the investigation to date. Several difficulties were detailed, including the fact that Parker denied any knowledge of the crime, as did others who were believed to have heard the incident discussed in Brown's presence. Brown's <b>co-accused,</b> the overseer Eastwood, alias [...] "Yorkie", had fled when the investigation began and had apparently left the colony aboard a whaling ship off Kangaroo Island. An important witness named Joice had gone to the neighbouring Port Phillip District of the colony of New South Wales, and Leandermin himself, who it appears was being detained at Guichen Bay, absconded and had apparently been [...] "made away with". The remaining witnesses were those that knew Brown, and apparently would not give evidence against him. Despite the extremely difficult task faced by the prosecution under these circumstances, the Advocate General ordered that investigations continue and issued warrants for the arrest of those that had fled South Australia. Brown appeared at the Supreme Court yet again on 10 and 28 September, but the judge again refused to hear the case without additional evidence. By the November sittings of the court, Brown's case had been removed from the listings, and this {{was the end of the}} matter as far as the formal investigation was concerned. Effectively, settler solidarity and the law of evidence ensured that Brown was never tried for the murders, despite the fact that those involved in the investigation had no doubt of his guilt. Possibly in response to Brown's case, the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 was amended in July 1849 to allow a person to be convicted on the sole testimony of an Aboriginal person.|$|E

Prosecution evidence included a shirt belonging to Barry containing semen matching the DNA profile of Camilleri. The shirt was discovered at the rubbish dump in Old Wallagoot Road where the pair had first taken the girls. Police recovered evidence from almost every location the pair had taken the girls and assaulted them.

[...] Carr was one of five women on death row in the state of Florida. On May 19, 2017, Emilia Carr was re-sentenced to life without parole. Heather Strong's husband, and Carr's <b>co-accused,</b> Joshua Fulgham was similarly convicted of first-degree murder and kidnapping in the death. At a separate trial, where he pled guilty, Joshua Fulgham received two consecutive sentences of life in prison.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 April 2009, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) dropped {{all charges}} against Zuma, {{as well as}} <b>co-accused</b> French arms company Thint, in light of new revelations about serious flaws in the prosecution. The revelations were {{in the form of}} intercepted phone calls showing that the head of the Scorpions, Leonard McCarthy, and the former National Director of Public Prosecutions, Bulelani Ngcuka, had conspired over the timing of the charges laid against Zuma, presumably to the {{political}} advantage of Zuma's political rival, President Thabo Mbeki. The announcement of the withdrawal of charges was made by the acting head of the NPA, Mokothedi Mpshe, who however stressed that the withdrawal was due to abuse which left the legal process [...] "tainted", and did not amount to an acquittal.|$|E
2500|$|Terry is {{a former}} {{professional}} boxer who has served time in prison (Wormwood Scrubs) ("two years for GBH and three for attempted robbery" [...] according to a police sergeant in the first episode, [...] "Gunfight at the OK Laundrette", although other episodes slightly contradict this and the overall charges are often quite vague), having served a substantial term because he would not become an informant against his <b>co-accused.</b> With few options, Terry is employed as Arthur's minder on vague and ungenerous terms, with it often being hinted that Arthur has manipulated him into this job, and indeed is seen to continue to manipulate Terry throughout the character's run in the series, despite his often attempting to find other means of employment and break free from Arthur's control. (The later feature-length special [...] "An Officer and a Car Salesman", which leads into Series 7, Terry's last stint in the series, begins with Terry once again inside, this time after being caught with some of Arthur's hookey merchandise).|$|E
2500|$|Marcos {{also ordered}} the {{immediate}} arrest {{of his political}} opponents and critics. Among those arrested were Senate President Jovito Salonga, Senator Jose Diokno, and Senator Benigno Aquino Jr., who Marcos linked with the Communists {{and the man who}} was groomed by the opposition to succeed Marcos after the 1973 elections. On November 25, 1977, the Military Commission charged Aquino along with his two <b>co-accused,</b> NPA leaders Bernabe Buscayno (Commander Dante) and Lt. Victor Corpuz, guilty of all charges and sentenced them to death by firing squad. While interviews with former Communist leaders revealed that Aquino provided the Communists with firearms, training area, and lodging [...] to oust Marcos, he denied being a communist leader or a communist himself. In his undelivered speech upon his return from the US on August 21, 1983, Aquino said, [...] "I was sentenced to die for allegedly being the leading communist leader. I am not a communist, never was and never will be." ...|$|E
2500|$|District {{judges and}} magistrates of the State Courts are {{appointed}} to their positions by the Legal Service Commission (LSC) on a term basis, {{and do not}} enjoy security of tenure. These judges can be transferred by the LSC from the courts to other government departments to serve as legal officers, and [...] This {{may be said to}} create a risk of executive interference. The transfer of Senior District Judge Michael Khoo is often cited as an illustration of this. Opposition Member of Parliament J.B. Jeyaretnam and a <b>co-accused</b> had each been charged with three charges of having fraudulently transferred cheques to prevent the distribution of money to the creditors of the Workers' Party of Singapore, and one charge of making a false declaration. In January 1981, Khoo acquitted the defendants of all charges except a single charge of fraud involving a cheque for S$400. He sentenced Jeyaretnam to a $1,000 fine, which was below the amount of $2,000 that would have caused him to lose his seat in Parliament. Upon the Public Prosecutor's appeal to the High Court, Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin ordered retrials on the two charges of cheque fraud that the defendants had been acquitted of. In August 1981, before the retrials, Khoo was transferred to the Attorney General's Chambers to take up appointment as a deputy public prosecutor. The defendants were convicted of the charges by a different senior district judge and sentenced to three months' imprisonment each. Jeyaretnam and his <b>co-accused</b> then appealed to the High Court, which confirmed their convictions but reduced the sentences to a fine of $5,000 each. However, a commission of inquiry convened in 1986 to examine Khoo's transfer determined that no evidence of executive interference in the State Courts had been presented, and that the transfer had been decided by the Chief Justice in consultation with the Attorney-General. It did not investigate why the transfer was made. In Parliamentary debates before and after the inquiry it was suggested on the one hand that the transfer had been routine and the timing coincidental, and on the other that it was related to Khoo's competence in handling the case. The reason for the transfer was never clearly established.|$|E
2500|$|Investigators {{discovered}} that Mebo stood for Meister & Bollier, an electronics firm in Zürich, Switzerland. It emerged {{at the trial}} {{that one of the}} owners, Edwin Bollier, had sold twenty MST-13 timers (identical to the one found in Senegal) to Libya in 1985, in the hope of winning a contract to supply the Libyan military. The first time he supplied a batch of timers he had accompanied Libyan officials to the desert city of Sabha, and had watched as his timers were used in explosions. He told the court that he had met Megrahi on that occasion for the first time, believing him to be a major in the Libyan army and a relative of Gaddafi's. After that meeting, Bollier said that Megrahi and his <b>co-accused,</b> Fhimah, who he believed were good friends, had set up a travel business together under the name ABH in the Mebo offices in Zürich. Fhimah later went onto to become the station manager for Libyan Arab Airlines at Luqa Airport in Malta. (Fhimah has acknowledged he worked for the airline but says he left the job three months before the bombing.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Information about SRA claims {{spread through}} {{conferences}} presented to religious groups, churches and professionals such as police forces and therapists {{as well as}} parents. These conferences and presentations served to organize agencies and foster communication between groups, maintaining and spreading disproven or exaggerated stories as fact. Members of local police forces organized into loose networks focused on cult crimes, some of whom billed themselves as [...] "experts" [...] and were paid to speak at conferences throughout the United States. Religious revivalists also {{took advantage of the}} rumors and preached about the dangers of Satanism to youth and presented themselves at paid engagements as secular experts. At the height of the panic, the highly emotional accusations and circumstances of SRA allegations made it difficult to investigate the claims, with the accused being assumed as guilty and skeptics becoming <b>co-accused</b> during trials, and trials moving forward based solely on the testimony of very young children without corroborating evidence. No forensic or corroborating evidence has ever been found for religiously based cannibalistic or murderous SRA, despite extensive investigations. The concern and reaction expressed by various groups regarding the seriousness or threat of SRA has been considered out of proportion to the actual threat by satanically motivated crimes, and the rare crime that exists that may be labeled [...] "satanic" [...] does not justify the existence of a conspiracy or network of religiously motivated child abusers.|$|E
2500|$|Accused {{of being}} Guilty of conspiracy. Convicted {{for getting the}} {{information}} about the landing at Shekhadi and that the main exit point could be in Mhasla Shrivardhan area. He is alleged to have laid a trap at Purarphata on Mhasla-Goregaon road on 30 January. Besides that, his team gave up the vigil after 2 February in spite of the warnings (confessions of <b>co-accused</b> in TADA Court shows that landing actually took place many days after team led by Thapa had left for Mumbai) and that the smugglers, in fact, postponed the landing as they heard from sources that an ambush had been laid for them by Thapa. These accusations stand to be the same even though confessions of others convicted say otherwise. To quote [...] "He (Phanse) also confessed that the duo (Phanse and Parkar)bribed all Customs officers except for Thapa, who incidentally is an accused in the case.". In the 10,000 page judgement copy provided, TADA Court judge, P.D. Kode resons that even though there is no direct or in-direct evidence against Mr. S.N. Thapa, he is awarded a term of life imprisonment because he was the seniormost customs officer and thus must be knowing about the conspiracy. Till his last days, Thapa proclaimed his innocence and was confident that the greater conspiracy of his wrongful arrest,trial and conviction would be unveiled in the Supreme Court who, in 1994 granted him bail after going through all evidence stating that there is no direct or in-direct evidence to prove that Mr. S.N. Thapa was part in planning, landing or transportation of contraband substances nor that was he aware of any such conspiracy for blasts in Mumbai.|$|E
2500|$|The zealous Bishop Northburgh found {{numerous}} shortcomings - {{minor and}} more serious, moral and financial - when he {{carried out a}} canonical visitation around 1323. Northburgh was clearly a stickler for transparent management {{and that of the}} priory fell far short of the best 14th century practice. He demanded that the prioress and other office holders be prepared to present the accounts. The two most senior lay staff were sacked: Annabel de de Hervill, the cellaress or purveyor of food and drink, and Robert de Herst, the keeper of the temporalities or estate manager. Northburgh froze admissions to the priory and forbade the prioress taking bribes from prospective members of the community - which presumably had happened to this point. Northburgh was also forced to reiterate many details of the basic monastic disciplines of poverty, chastity and obedience. One of the nuns was receiving a rental income for personal use and was ordered to share it with the whole house. The prioress was instructed to take her meals in the refectory and to sleep in the dormitory, like the others. [...] Lay people were not to sleep in the convent, and this included the prioress's maid. The nuns were not to converse with outsiders, and nuns were not to leave the cloister without good reason: one Emma of Bromsgrove was named as falling short in this regard. A Franciscan friar was appointed as a confessor to the nuns. It is unclear whether an excess of financial zeal led to a brush with the law in 1324. At Easter of that year Prioress Alice Swynnerton was accused, with two others, of taking by force two oxen, valued at 40 shillings, the property of Clement of Wolverhampton, at Horsebrook. She was distrained and her <b>co-accused</b> arrested by the sheriff to secure their appearance at the next court sessions. At Trinity the charge was expanded to include a total of 100 shillings' worth of goods and chattels. However, Alice and her accomplices did not respond to the summons and the 10 shillings already distrained from her was forfeit.|$|E
