5|$|Culik {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that a cellular automaton has an injective transition function {{if and only if}} the transition function is injective on the subsets of configurations that are periodic (repeating the same substring infinitely often in both directions). He defines a nondeterministic finite-state transducer that performs the transition rule of the automaton on periodic strings. This transducer works by remembering the neighborhood of the automaton {{at the start of the}} string and entering an accepting state when that neighborhood <b>concatenated</b> to the end of the input would cause its nondeterministically chosen transitions to be correct. Culik then swaps the input and output of the transducer. The transducer resulting from this swap simulates the inverse dynamics of the given automaton. Finally, Culik applies previously known algorithms to test whether the resulting swapped transducer maps each input to a single output.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{molecular}} genetics suggested {{the concept that}} one gene makes one protein. This concept (originally called the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis) emerged from an influential 1941 paper by George Beadle and Edward Tatum on experiments with mutants of the fungus Neurospora crassa. Norman Horowitz, an early colleague on the Neurospora research, reminisced in 2004 that “these experiments founded the science of what Beadle and Tatum called biochemical genetics. In actuality they {{proved to be the}} opening gun in what became {{molecular genetics}} and all the developments that have followed from that.” The one gene-one protein concept has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short section across the genome whose mRNAs are <b>concatenated</b> by trans-splicing.|$|E

Six reference trees were reconstructed using either the highly conserved small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences, a consensus of the available gene trees or <b>concatenated</b> alignments of orthologs.

25|$|We could, alternatively, {{choose an}} {{encoding}} for Turing machines, where an encoding {{is a function}} which associates to each Turing Machine M a bitstring <M>. If M is a Turing Machine which, on input w, outputs string x, then the <b>concatenated</b> string <M> w is a description of x. For theoretical analysis, this approach is more suited for constructing detailed formal proofs and is generally preferred in the research literature. In this article, an informal approach is discussed.|$|E

25|$|The word “Transcriptome” {{was first}} used in the 1990s. In 1995, one of the {{earliest}} sequencing-based transcriptomic methods was developed, Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE), which worked by Sanger sequencing of <b>concatenated</b> random transcript fragments. Transcripts were quantified by matching the fragments to known genes. A variant of SAGE using high-throughput sequencing techniques, called digital gene expression analysis, was also briefly used. However, these methods were largely overtaken by high throughput sequencing of entire transcripts, which provided additional information on transcript structure e.g. splice variants.|$|E

25|$|A {{classical}} type {{of error}} correction coding used with OFDM-based systems is convolutional coding, often <b>concatenated</b> with Reed-Solomon coding. Usually, additional interleaving (on {{top of the}} time and frequency interleaving mentioned above) in between the two layers of coding is implemented. The choice for Reed-Solomon coding as the outer error correction code is based on the observation that the Viterbi decoder used for inner convolutional decoding produces short error bursts when there is a high concentration of errors, and Reed-Solomon codes are inherently well-suited to correcting bursts of errors.|$|E
25|$|Another study (Chen & Li, 2001) sequenced 53 non-repetitive, intergenic DNA {{segments}} from a human, a chimpanzee, a gorilla, and orangutan. When the DNA sequences were <b>concatenated</b> to {{a single}} long sequence, the generated neighbor-joining tree supported the Homo-Pan clade with 100% bootstrap (that is that humans and chimpanzees are the closest related species of the four). When three species are fairly closely {{related to each other}} (like human, chimpanzee and gorilla), the trees obtained from DNA sequence data may not be congruent with the tree that represents the speciation (species tree).|$|E
25|$|Newer systems, however, usually now adopt near-optimal {{types of}} error {{correction}} codes {{that use the}} turbo decoding principle, where the decoder iterates towards the desired solution. Examples of such error correction coding types include turbo codes and LDPC codes, which perform close to the Shannon limit for the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Some systems that have implemented these codes have <b>concatenated</b> them with either Reed-Solomon (for example on the MediaFLO system) or BCH codes (on the DVB-S2 system) to improve upon an error floor inherent to these codes at high signal-to-noise ratios.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} recover {{meaningful}} signal and error free audio from a signal impaired by interference and fading, the receiver uses <b>concatenated</b> Reed-Solomon block coding and Forward Error Correction encoding and decoding (codec). This technique was proven {{in the early}} days of satellite modems in the late 1970s. Linkabit, then run by Irwin Jacobs prior to his involvement with Qualcomm, offered such a codec for rack mounting in satellite earth stations. The Sirius signal uses more robust error correction on control channels than on the audio content, trading off error correction and bandwidth differently for separate categories of bits in the signal waveform.|$|E

Cerro Luca, in the Group of Cerro Grande will be named by the two climbers {{with the name of}} Mauri's son.

This impressive traverse took place only two days after the first ascent of Cerro Mariano Moreno.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{a new and}} {{surprising}} discovery was made by Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir: over all possible RC4 keys, the statistics {{for the first few}} bytes of output keystream are strongly non-random, leaking information about the key. If the nonce and long-term key are simply <b>concatenated</b> to generate the RC4 key, this long-term key can be discovered by analysing a large number of messages encrypted with this key. This and related effects were then used to break the WEP ("wired equivalent privacy") encryption used with 802.11 wireless networks. This caused a scramble for a standards-based replacement for WEP in the 802.11 market, and led to the IEEE 802.11i effort and WPA.|$|E
