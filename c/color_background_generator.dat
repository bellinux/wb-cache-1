40|$|We {{measured}} phase shifts between Long-wavelength cone (L-cone) and Middle-wavelength cone (M-cone) signals {{as well as}} sensitivity in the luminance pathway either {{following a}} cone-silent substitution of <b>colored</b> <b>background</b> or on a steady <b>colored</b> <b>background.</b> In background substitution, the phase shifts between L- and M-cone signals varied only slightly depending on the substituted color, whereas marked elevation of the threshold following the substitution of <b>colored</b> <b>background</b> was found. In contrast, the phase shifts, as well as threshold, varied largely, depending on the <b>background</b> <b>color</b> in the steady background. These facts suggest that suppression by the cone-opponent process for <b>background</b> <b>color</b> substitution {{is different from the}} one for a steady <b>colored</b> <b>background.</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|During the {{presentation}} of the empty shape on a <b>colored</b> <b>background,</b> the <b>colored</b> <b>background</b> induces an illusory complementary color ("induced color") inside the empty shape (i.e. bird). After the disappearance of the <b>colored</b> <b>background</b> an afterimage of the [...] "induced color" [...] might appear inside the [...] "empty shape". Thus, the expected color of the shape will be complementary to the [...] "induced color", and therefore similar to the color of the original background.|$|R
50|$|Limitations of the {{watercolor}} illusion were studied. The color-spreading effect occurs on <b>colored</b> <b>backgrounds</b> {{in addition to}} the white or gray. In the case of a <b>colored</b> <b>background,</b> {{the watercolor}} illusion color spread does not mix with the <b>background</b> <b>color</b> but does get superimposed onto the <b>colored</b> <b>background.</b> For lighting conditions, the color spreading effect declines as the illumination in the room increases. It is the strongest at medium illumination. Lastly, the watercolor illusion persists even when dotted lines are used for the purple contour and orange fringe instead of continuous lines.|$|R
