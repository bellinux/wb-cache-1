25|$|The XG was {{essentially}} an update of the XF. It gained the EB II's 4.0-l OHC inline six-cylinder engine, {{with either a}} five-speed manual or four-speed auto transmissions (floor or <b>column</b> <b>shift),</b> meaning Ford could retire the old engine and transmission options. It also gained interior updates from the EB including the instrument cluster, centre console (in two-seater models), steering wheel, and seats. Exterior changes were minimal, and included an EB-style grill, black window trims (as opposed to chrome on XF's) EB style door 'rubbing' strips, and indicator lights on the front quarter panels.|$|E
25|$|As {{the fuel}} crisis eased, Australians {{moved away from}} the {{downsized}} Commodore back to the traditional full-size Falcon. In 1982, {{for the first time in}} more than a decade, the XE Falcon, with its Watt's linkage coil-sprung rear suspension and fuel-saving differential ratios (4.1-l models) eclipsed its Holden rival in terms of sales. Ford Falcon remained number-one seller in Australia until 1988, when Holden returned to the full-size Australian sedan design. A manual transmission was available in three-speed <b>column</b> <b>shift</b> (in six-seater vehicles) or four-speed floor shift, with a five-speed floor shift also available with the base 3.3-l engine. An automatic transmission was available as a three-speed, column or floor shift.|$|E
25|$|Replacing the old Dynaflow-based {{two-speed}} {{automatic transmission}} were two new Super Turbine automatics. The two-speed Super Turbine 300 (shared with the intermediate-sized cars) was available {{with the standard}} two-barrel 300 V8 while the three-speed Super Turbine 400 (shared with other big Buicks and Rivieras) was standard with the 300 four-barrel and optional with the standard engine {{as well as the}} 401 in the Estate Wagon. The standard transmission with the base 300 two-barrel V8 was a three-speed <b>column</b> <b>shift</b> manual and a four-speed manual was available as an option with either engine. The new ST300 transmission carried over the variable pitch torque converter from the Dynaflow that had been used since the mid-1950s, while the first year for the ST400 featured a fixed-pitch converter.|$|E

25|$|All taxis bear a {{semi-circular}} green {{plate on}} the front grille, and {{at the back of}} the vehicle indicating the number of seats available. Throughout history, most Hong Kong taxis have been 4-door saloons with bench seats in the front, thus allowing it to carry up to five passengers (driver excluded). In the early 1980s, 4-passenger taxis were introduced. Smaller saloons such as the Nissan Bluebird 910, Nissan Sunny B12, Toyota Corona (CT141) and the Mitsubishi Lancer were used. However, these were all phased out by the mid-1990s. Since then and until 2008, all Hong Kong taxis have been 5-passengers vehicles. But from 2008, the new Toyota Comfort equipped with new 2.0 VVT-i engine and equipped with floor shift automatic instead of <b>column</b> <b>shift</b> automatic, making the new Comfort a 4-passengers taxi again.|$|E

The car was powered by an unusually small 2351cc sidevalve V8 engine called Aquillon in France, derived from Ford's Flathead engine family, whose displacement positioned the car into the [...] "13CV" [...] French tax class. Equipped with a two-barrel Zenith-Stromberg 32NX carburetor, it produced [...] Power {{was transferred to the}} rear live axle through a three-speed manual transmission with <b>column</b> <b>shift.</b> The Vedette had independent front suspension (by MacPherson struts) and drum brakes on all four wheels.|$|E

50|$|A {{wide variety}} of transmissions, both manual and automatic, were {{available}} in Champs. Base models came with a three-speed <b>column</b> <b>shifted</b> manual (AKA: 3 on the tree), with four- and five-speeds optional, as well as overdrive (with the three-speed). Studebaker's Flight-O-Matic (built by Borg-Warner) was the automatic option. This same transmission was used by other manufacturers, including Ford.|$|R
50|$|The Fiat 1900, {{introduced}} in 1952, was an upmarket model that {{used the same}} body as the 1400, but came with a 1.9 litre engine and more standard features.

2500|$|For 1964, {{the third}} {{generation}} Rambler American debuted in Mexico and was available only as a two-door sedan, four-door sedan, and four-door station wagon body designs.

This transmission completely replaced the old two-speed automatic offered with the smaller base engines in past years, while the 455 was paired with the Turbo Hydra-matic 400.

Only about 1,400 cars were built with the inline six in 1973.

At the bottom edge of the front fender directly behind the front wheel was a badge that said [...] "Futuramic" [...] which identified an Oldsmobile approach to simplified driving, {{and the presence of}} an automatic transmission. [...] Styling changes for the 1950 model include the replacement of a two-piece windshield with a one-piece unit and the addition of the Holiday hardtop coupe to the line. Also a three-speed manual transmission with <b>column</b> <b>shift</b> became available as a [...] "delete for credit" [...] option to the Hydra-Matic automatic transmission.

2500|$|In 1961 Fuji Precision Industries {{changed its}} name to Prince Motor Company after the 1954 merger. Two years later, in September 1963, the S50 Skyline Deluxe series was launched. Like its predecessor, it came in sedan and wagon bodystyles. This was the second {{generation}} car, and became one of the more desirable cars in Japan. It was powered by the G-1 engine, a 68hp or [...] version of the old GA-4. The S50 series were available with a three-speed <b>column</b> <b>shift</b> transmission, or a four-speed floor shift transmission from February 1965 (Deluxe only), either as a four-door sedan (S50) or a five-door wagon (W50). A two-speed automatic option was added to the Deluxe in June 1966. The lower priced and equipped Standard model was added in April 1964; aiming at taxi operators and others it also lacked bumper overriders, making it 11cm shorter. Three main models of the S50 were built: the S50-1 (1964–1966), the lightly facelifted S50-2 (1967–1968) and the S50-3 (1968). These all used the same engine, with the later S57 receiving a more modern unit. In Japan its market position was refocused as a competitor to the Datsun Bluebird and the Toyota Corona.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, a {{lightweight}} WE4 (Turbo T) option was offered. Only 1,547 of this variant were produced.

[...] 1987 was the only year that the LC2 Turbo option was available on any Regal, making it possible to even see a Limited with a vinyl landau roof and a power bulge turbo hood.

An {{extremely}} rare five-door wagon, more luxuriously equipped than the Van and with entirely different rear bodywork was added somewhat later, and was aimed at private rather than commercial use. A four-speed, full-synchro, <b>column</b> <b>shifted</b> manual was standard, whether in Standard or Custom equipment levels.

The hardtop retained the Rambler Classic SST name while the four-door sedan changed from Rambler Classic 770 to Rambler Classic DPL. Both body styles saw the same features as the 1971 AMC Matadors and were almost equal with only few exclusive characteristics for each.

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1963 model run, the 292 Y-block V8 was replaced as the base V8 engine with the Fairlane's new small block 260. The 260 proved under-powered for the heavy full size Ford and was replaced midyear (coincident with the introduction of the 63 and 1/2 models) with the 289 V8. [...] The 289 was then the largest of the [...] "small block series" [...] that was first used (221 cubic inch version) in the 1962 Fairlane. [...] The 260 was offered on the Falcon Sprint and later, in mid 1964, in the early version of the 1965 Mustang. By 1965 model introduction (in the fall of 1964), the 260 (which had disappointing performance in all versions including the Sprint and Mustang) was replaced by the 289 in all models. Ford continued to offer the FE series 352 in the 1963 full size, as well as 3 versions of the 390 V8 (regular, high performance, and police). Five different transmissions were offered for 1963. A 3-speed manual <b>column</b> <b>shift</b> was standard on all models except the 406 V8, which required the heavier duty Borg-Warner 4-speed manual. A three speed manual with overdrive was optional, but rarely ordered. The two-speed Ford-O-Matic was common with the 6-cylinder and small block V-8s, while the majority of big blocks (352 and 390) were ordered with the 3-speed Cruise-O-Matic automatic transmission. The availability of several different rear end ratios, along with 5 transmissions, and 8 different engines, led to a huge number of different driveline combinations for 1963. The most produced combination for the Galaxie and Galaxie 500 was the 352 V8, with Cruise-O-Matic and the 3.0 rear end ratio.|$|E
