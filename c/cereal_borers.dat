40|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} Y-tube {{olfactometer}} studies {{are useful for}} demonstrating the responsiveness of male moths to sex pheromones. However, in the <b>cereal</b> stem <b>borer,</b> Busseola fusca (Fuller) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), wind tunnel bioassays yielded poor results when the behavioural responses of females to plant odours were tested. We demonstrated that for B. fusca females, the Y-tube olfactometer was better suited for measuring the attractiveness of plant odours, compared with the wind tunnel. In particular, we showed B. fusca preference for odours of a host over a non-host plant species using this apparatus. Behavioural responses for B. fusca after host finding are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Plant infestation, {{stem borer}} density, parasitism, and {{parasitoid}} abundance were assessed during {{two years in}} two host plants, Zea mays (L.) (Cyperales: Poaceae) and Sorghum bicolor (L.) (Cyperales: Poaceae), in cultivated habitats. The four major host plants (Cyperus spp., Panicum spp., Pennisetum spp., and Sorghum spp.) found in natural habitats were also assessed, and both the cultivated and natural habitat species occurred in four agroecological zones in Kenya. Across habitats, plant infestation (23. 2 %), stem borer density (2. 2 per plant), and larval parasitism (15. 0 %) were highest in maize in cultivated habitats. Pupal parasitism was not higher than 4. 7 % in both habitats, and did not vary with locality during each season or with host plant between each season. Cotesia sesamiae (Cameron) and C. flavipes Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) were the key parasitoids in cultivated habitats (both species accounted for 76. 4 % of parasitized stem <b>borers</b> in <b>cereal</b> crops), but not in natural habitats (the two Cotesia species accounted for 14. 5 % of parasitized stem borers in wild host plants). No single parasitoid species exerted high parasitism rates on stem borer populations in wild host plants. Low stem borer densities across seasons in natural habitats indicate that <b>cereal</b> stem <b>borer</b> pests do not necessarily survive the non-cropping season feeding actively in wild host plants. Although natural habitats provided refuges for some parasitoid species, stem borer parasitism was generally low in wild host plants. Overall, because parasitoids contribute little in reducing <b>cereal</b> stem <b>borer</b> pest populations in cultivated habitats, there is need to further enhance their effectiveness {{in the field to}} regulate these pests...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTo develop {{efficient}} and safe biological control, {{we need to}} reliably identify natural enemy species, determine their host range, and understand the mechanisms that drive host range evolution. We investigated these points in Cotesia sesamiae, an African parasitic wasp of <b>cereal</b> stem <b>borers.</b> Phylogenetic analyses of 74 individual wasps, based on six mitochondrial and nuclear genes, revealed three lin-eages. We then investigated the ecological status (host plant and host insect ranges in the field, and host insect suitability tests) and the biological status (cross-mating tests) of the three lineages. We found that one highly supported lineage showed all the hallmarks of a cryptic species. It is associated with one host insect, Sesamia nonagrioides, and is reproductively isolated from the other two lineages by pre-and postmating barriers. The other two lineages had a more variable phylogenetic support, depending {{on the set of}} genes; they exhibited an overlapping and diversified range of host species and are not reproductively isolated from one another. We discuss the ecological conditions and mechanisms that likely generated this ongoing speciation and the relevance of this new specialist taxon in the genus Cotesia for biological control...|$|R

Host-plant resistance, biopesticides, natural enemies, and synthetic chemicals are some of the potential options for integrated pest management. However, the relative efficacy of many of these pest control measures is likely to change as a result of global warming. Climate change will also result in increased problems with insect-transmitted diseases. These changes will have major implications for crop protection and food security, particularly in developing countries where the need to increase and sustain food production is most urgent. Long-term monitoring of population levels and insect behavior, particularly in identifiably sensitive regions, may provide some of the first indications of a biological response to climate change...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent of}} damage to crop plants from pest insects depends on the {{foraging}} behaviour of the insect's feeding stage. Little is known, however, about the genetic and molecular bases of foraging behaviour in phytophagous pest insects. The foraging gene (for), a candidate gene encoding a PKG-I, has an evolutionarily conserved function in feeding strategies. Until now, for had never been studied in Lepidoptera, which includes major pest species. The <b>cereal</b> stem <b>borer</b> Sesamia nonagrioides is therefore a relevant species within this order with which to study conservation of and polymorphism in the for gene, {{and its role in}} foraging - a behavioural trait that is directly associated with plant injuries. Full sequencing of for cDNA in S. nonagrioides revealed a high degree of conservation with other insect taxa. Activation of PKG by a cGMP analogue increased larval foraging activity, measured by how frequently larvae moved between food patches in an actimeter. We found one non-synonymous allelic variation in a natural population that defined two allelic variants. These variants presented significantly different levels of foraging activity, and the behaviour was positively correlated to gene expression levels. Our results show that for gene function is conserved in this species of Lepidoptera, and describe an original case of a single nucleotide polymorphism associated with foraging behaviour variation in a pest insect. By illustrating how variation in this single gene can predict phenotype, this work opens new perspectives into the evolutionary context of insect adaptation to plants, as well as pest management...|$|R
40|$|The <b>cereal</b> stem <b>borer</b> Busseola fusca Fuller (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is {{a species}} endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. It {{is a major}} pest of maize and {{cultivated}} sorghum, the main cereal crops on the African mainland. Previous studies using mitochondrial markers revealed the presence of three clades of haplotypes (W, KI, KII) among B. fusca populations. Previous preliminary studies based on a few B. fusca individuals collected from three localities within the Guineo-Congolian rain forest in Cameroon demonstrated a matching with clade KII, a fairly surprising result because the putative centre of origin of that clade is located 3 similar to 000 similar to km away in East Africa. To check this finding, 120 individuals of B. fusca covering several Cameroonian sites belonging to both Guineo-Congolian rain forest and Afromontane vegetation mosaics were collected. Comparison of cytochrome b sequences using the same marker revealed low mitochondrial diversity (h similar to=similar to 0. 483 similar to+/-similar to 0. 054, p similar to=similar to 0. 073 similar to+/-similar to 0. 061 %). Moreover, molecular diversity in the Guineo-Congolian rain forest zone was lower than that in Afromontane vegetation, which is therefore {{thought to be the}} likely starting point for the colonization of other zones in Cameroon. The study showed a moderate but significant structuring between populations (FST similar to=similar to 0. 034, P< 0. 001) as well as within and among the two Cameroonian phytogeographical groups considered (FSC similar to=similar to 0. 000 and FCT similar to=similar to 0. 051, respectively, both P< 0. 001). Nested clade phylogeographic analysis indicated that all Cameroonian clades with significant geographical associations were interpreted as a phenomenon of contiguous range expansion. All results suggest that the Cameroonian population of B. fusca is relatively recent and originates from the recent geographical expansion of clade KII...|$|R
40|$|Maize (Zea mays) {{is a major}} {{staple food}} in Africa. However, maize {{production}} is severely reduced by damage caused by feeding lepidopteran pests. In East and Southern Africa, Chilo partellus {{is one of the}} most damaging <b>cereal</b> stem <b>borers</b> mainly found in the warmer lowland areas. In this study, it was hypothesized that the future distribution and abundance of C. partellus may be affected greatly by the current global warming. The temperature-dependent population growth potential of C. partellus was studied on artificial diet under laboratory conditions at six constant temperatures (15, 18, 20, 25, 28, 30, 32 and 35 degrees C), relative humidity of 75 +/- 5 % and a photoperiod of L 12 :L 12 h. Several non-linear models were fitted to the data to model development time, mortality and reproduction of the insect species. Cohort updating algorithm and rate summation approach were stochastically used for simulating age and stage structure populations and generate life-table parameters. For spatial analysis of the pest risk, three generic risk indices (index of establishment, generation number and activity index) were visualized in the geographical information system component of the advanced Insect Life Cycle modeling (ILCYM) software. To predict the future distribution of C. partellus we used the climate change scenario A 1 B obtained from WorldClim and CCAFS databases. The maps were compared with available data on the current distribution of C. partellus in Kenya. The results show that the development times of the different stages decreased with increasing temperatures ranging from 18 to 35 degrees C; at the extreme temperatures, 15 and 38 degrees C, no egg could hatch and no larvae completed development. The study concludes that C. partellus may potentially expands its range into higher altitude areas, highland tropics and moist transitional regions, with the highest maize potential where the species has not been recorded yet. This has serious implication in terms of food security since these areas produce approximately 80 % of the total maize in East Africa...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} {{and extent of}} parasitism of Cotesia flavipes Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) on stem borer species attacking maize and sorghum were assessed in three zones of northeastern Ethiopia. Cotesia flavipes {{was found to be}} the key larval parasitoid of <b>cereal</b> stem <b>borer</b> species in all areas surveyed. This parasitoid has been introduced into several African countries for the control of Chilo partellus in maize and sorghum, but it has never been released in Ethiopia. The survey results indicated that the {{distribution and}} extent of parasitism of Cot. flavipes followed the distribution and severity of its suitable host, C. partellus. A Cotesia flavipes parasitism rate of between 33 % and 82 % was recorded in sub-moist warm (lowland) AEZs of all zones. In contrast, a parasitism rate of less than 6 % was recorded in moist, cool highland areas where Busseola fusca was the predominant species. Cotesia flavipes caused lower rate of parasitism on stem borers in maize (up to 72 %) than that of sorghum (up to 82 %) in the three zones. In summary, high rates of parasitism of Cot. flavipes were recorded in lowland areas where C. partellus was the dominant borer species and low rates of parasitism were recorded in highland areas where B. fusca was the predominant species. Cotesia flavipes caused the highest parasitism (82 %) on C. partellus. This result verified that Cot. flavipes contributed to the reduction of C. partellus population in lowlands, regardless of the zone, and its rate of parasitism varied between crop stages, crop types, elevations, host, and host stages. Findings of this study have particularly relevant information on the contribution of Cot. flavipes to the population reduction of stem borers, time or stage of its occurrence in relation to host stages and crop stages, and its distribution in relation to the availability of a suitable host across each zone. In conclusion, this larval parasitoid {{plays an important role in}} reducing stem borer populations and can be used as one component of integrated stem borer management in northeastern Ethiopia...|$|R
40|$|Interactions {{within and}} between species sharing the same {{resources}} are characterised by competition or facilitation, and can be influenced by factors such as larval numbers and phenotypic plasticity of the interactions. The effect of larval density on the survival and relative growth rate of the stemborers Busseola fusca (Fuller) and Sesamia calamistis Hampson (both Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) were studied, {{as well as the}} temporal plasticity of their competitive interactions. These stemborers attack maize crops (Zea mays L.) (Poaceae) in sub-Saharan Africa. Experiments were conducted in the laboratory under controlled conditions at the optimum development temperature (25 degrees C) for the three species. Surrogate stems filled with artificial diet were intra- and interspecifically infested with larvae of each species. The effect of larval density on competition was studied at low (six larvae) and high (12 larvae) levels of infestation, whereas the temporal plasticity of competition was evaluated at 7, 14, 21, or 28 days after infestation. The two experiments involved single- and multi-species infestation treatments. Larval numbers and wet mass in each artificial stem were recorded in each experiment. Survival and relative growth rate of the three species were significantly higher at low-infestation levels when facing either intra- or interspecific competition. The intensity of competition was also temporally plastic among the species and increased as the duration of competition increased. These results are discussed in terms of general infestations of <b>cereal</b> crops by <b>borers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{management}} involving conservative {{biological control}} {{could be a}} good crop pest management option in poor African countries. A survey was conducted from August 2013 to July 2014 in a rainfed lowland region near Pélébina, northern Benin, in order to characterize spatiotemporal lanscape changes and investigate their influence on the main crop pests and their associated natural enemies. The area was mapped mainly regarding crop fields and fallows. Visual observations were recorded and a database was compiled. Major landscape composition changes were noted between rainy and dry seasons, which affected the presence of both pests and natural enemies. Cereals (rice, maize and sorghum) and cotton were grown in the humid season, and then okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) was the dominant vegetable crop in dry season. These modifications impacted fallow abundance throughout the lowland. Different cotton (e. g. Helicoverpa armigera, Dysdercus sp., Zonocerus variegatus) or rice (e. g. Diopsis Iongicornis, D. apicalis) pests were observed during dry season in okra crops. Dry season surveys of Poaceae in two types of fallows ('humid', 'dry') revealed the presence of very few stem borers: only 0. 004 % of stems sampled were infested by stem borers, with a mean of 1. 13 larvae per stem. Known <b>cereal</b> stem <b>borer</b> species such as Busseola fusca, Coniesta ignefusalis, Sesamia calamistis were not clearly identified among these larvae of their diapausing stage and white color. Unexpected pollinators (Hymenoptera Apidae, genus Braunsapis, Ceratina and Xylocopa) and predators (Crabronidae, genus Dasyproctus) were found in the stems. Sweep-net collection of insects in humid fallows allowed us to describe {{for the first time in}} Benin seven Diopsidae species (23 % of adults bearing Laboulbeniomycetes ectoparasitic fungi). Some of these species were captured in rice fields during rainy season. Parasitoids (adult Chalcidoidae and Ichneumonoidae) were observed during both seasons but their impact on stem borers was hard to determine, even during the rainy season, due to their low abundance and the difficulty of identification. Predators (Reduviidae, Odonata) were found mainly in humid fallows and rice fields. Regarding our observations, we suggest the presence of alternate host crops such as okra during the dry season for rainy season crop pests. Moreover, fallows also had a real ecological role as a habitat resource for many guilds of insects (pollinators, pests, predators). The management of these landscape components should be the focus of a long-term study with the aim of enhancing pest management of rauny season crop pests. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Scientists in {{developing}} countries are becoming increasingly aware {{of the value of}} spatial information for assessing and predicting the distribution of insect pests. In this process, geographical information systems (GIS) can {{play a key role in}} the management, visualization and analysis of geographical data in digital format. So far, however, GIS have remained largely in the domain of experts, with access often restricted by factors such as cost, complexity and the availability of data, particularly {{in developing}} countries. To rectify this situation, a team of software developers from Mud Springs Geographers, Inc., in collaboration with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), developed the Awhere Almanac Characterization Tool (ACT), a stand-alone package that is well suited to the needs of agricultural researchers and decision makers {{in developing countries}}. Awhere-ACT is unique in that it integrates GIS tools with extensive databases (on climate, land use, elevation, etc.) relevant to agriculture. It is also user-friendly - with only a few days´ training, users can easily generate maps showing, for example, zones with similar climatic conditions in a particular season. The package is available free to users in developing countries. Scientists involved with a number of insect pest management programmes in Africa are now benefiting from the facilities provided by Awhere-ACT, as the following examples demonstrate. Predicting the spread of stem borers Maize is one of the most important staple food crops in sub-Saharan Africa, but farm productivity is limited by a variety of insect pests, in particular the stem borer beetle. There are several native species of stem borer in the African maize belt, but the exotic Chilo partellus is by far the most devastating. Introduced from Asia in the early 20 th century, Chilo has spread to all countries in East and Southern Africa, and is still extending its range. The Biological Control of <b>Cereal</b> Stem <b>Borers</b> project of the Nairobi-based International Centre for Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) is following a classical biological control approach, whereby natural predators associated with Chilo in Asia are being introduced into Africa. Using Awhere-ACT, researchers at ICIPE first determine which climatic factors, such as rainfall and temperature, favour the spread of the borer in Asia. They then identify those areas in Africa where the climate conditions are similar, allowing them to predict those that are likely to be at risk of Chilo invasions in Africa, and to recommend where to introduce natural predators. Identifying fungus release sites to control the cassava green mite The cassava green mite, Monony-chellus tanajoa, is a major pest that affects cassava in many parts of Africa. Controlling this mite has been the focus of a long-running biological control programme of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA). In Brazil, the mite´s country of origin, its spread is effectively restricted by a pathogenic fungus, Neozygites tanajoae. IITA has recently introduced the fungus as a control agent in Benin, where it has become established in some areas. Based on this success, researchers at the Kenyan Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) and IITA are now using Awhere-ACT to identify areas in Kenya with agro-meteorological characteristics similar to those in Brazil and Benin where Neozygites has been successful, so that they can specify the most effective release sites. In both of these examples, the application of appropriate GIS tools and databases is helping African scientists to make better decisions regarding where to target their pest control interventions, thereby increasing the efficiency of the research process and contributing to the efforts to ensure food security.
