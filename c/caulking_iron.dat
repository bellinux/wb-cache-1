50|$|Oakum is a {{preparation}} of tarred fibre used in shipbuilding for caulking or packing the joints of timbers in wooden vessels and the deck planking {{of iron and}} steel ships, as well as cast iron pipe plumbing applications. It was forced between the seams using a hammer and a <b>caulking</b> <b>iron,</b> then sealed into place with hot pitch.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{caulking}} {{was made}} from combining the fibers of cotton and oakum, a type of hemp rope fiber soaked in pine tar. The sticky caulk mixture would be driven into a wedge-shaped seam between the wooden boat hull planks, with a caulking mallet and a broad chisel-like tool called a <b>caulking</b> <b>iron</b> to create a watertight seal.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional {{caulking}} (also spelled calking) {{on wooden}} vessels uses fibers of cotton and oakum (hemp fiber soaked in pine tar). These fibers are {{driven into the}} wedge-shaped seam between planks, with a caulking mallet and a broad chisel-like tool called a <b>caulking</b> <b>iron.</b> The caulking is then covered over with a putty, {{in the case of}} hull seams, or else in deck seams with melted pine pitch, in a process referred to as paying, or [...] "calefaction" ...|$|E

60|$|This {{plan was}} very simple, {{though it had}} its own ingenuity. It will be remembered that water could now only enter the vessel's hold at the main-hatch, all the other {{hatchways}} having their coamings above the element. The carpenter proposed, therefore, that the main-hatches, which had been off when the tornado occurred, but which had been found on deck when the vessel righted, should now be put on, oakum being first laid along in their rabbetings, and that the cracks should be stuffed with additional oakum, to exclude as much water as possible. He thought that two or three men, by using <b>caulking</b> <b>irons</b> for ten minutes, would make the hatch-way so tight that very little water would penetrate. While this was doing, he himself would bore as many holes forward and aft as he could, with a two inch auger, out of which the water then in the vessel would be certain to run. Spike was delighted with this project, and gave the necessary orders on the spot.|$|R
5000|$|For {{traditional}} sailing ships, {{items that}} {{could be found in}} a chandlery might include rosin, turpentine, tar, pitch (resin), linseed oil, whale oil, tallow, lard, varnish, twine, rope and cordage, hemp, oakum, tools (hatchet, axe, hammer, chisel, planes, lantern, nail, spike, boat hook, <b>caulking</b> <b>iron,</b> hand pump, marlinspike), brooms, mops, galley supplies, leather goods, and paper. In the days of sail ship chandlers on remote islands, such as St. Helena, were responsible for delivering re-supplies of water and fresh produce (fruit and vegetables) to stave off scurvy. [...] The ship chandlery business was central to the existence and the social and political dynamics of ports and their waterfront areas.|$|E
