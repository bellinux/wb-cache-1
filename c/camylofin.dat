50|$|<b>Camylofin</b> is an antimuscarinic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Camylofin</b> is {{made from}} BnCO2H in a 3-step {{reaction}} consisting of a Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky halogenation, esterfication of the acid bromide with isoamylalcohol, and then reaction of the remaining alkylbromide with 2-(dethylamino)ethylamine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Camylofin</b> is {{a smooth}} muscle relaxant with both {{anticholinergic}} action {{as well as}} direct smooth muscle action. Anticholinergic action is produced by inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine to muscarinic receptors, but the action is less pronounced. Direct smooth muscle relaxation is achieved by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type IV, which leads to increased cyclic AMP and eventually reduced cytosolic calcium. Thus <b>camylofin</b> has a comprehensive action to relieve smooth muscle spasm. It is used to treat stomach ache in infants and children. Usually it is given in combination with paracetamol to treat stomach ache, as well as pyrexia.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} paper describes simple analytical method for determination of <b>Camylofin</b> dihydrochloride and Nimesulide in tablet formulation by Gas chromatography method. Benzoic acid {{was used as}} internal standard. Validation {{was carried out in}} compliance with the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. The method utilized GC (Agilent Technologies 6890 N Network GC system with FID detector), and RTX- 5 capillary column (5 % diphenyl- 95 % dimethyl polysiloxane), 30 m × 0. 53 mm, 1. 5 µm as stationary phase. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL?min– 1. The proposed method was validated for linearity, LOD, LOQ, accuracy, precision, ruggedness and solution stability. It can be conveniently adopted for routine quality control analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} work {{describes the}} method development of simultaneous determination of <b>camylofin</b> dihydrochloride (CMF), diclofenac potassium (DCF), and Paracetamol (PCM) using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) and the method was further {{transferred to a}} new generation instrument, ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC-PDA). The detailed validation was carried out for the combination tablet formulation of CMF and DCF by UPLC-PDA. From the method development study, Acquity UPLC HSS C 18 (2. 1 × 50 [*]mm, 1. 8 [*]μm) was finally selected for validation. The satisfactory results were observed for peak shape, retention time, and resolution with a mobile phase of 20 [*]mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 3. 0 with dilute orthophosphoric acid) [*]:[*]methanol (33 [*]:[*] 67 v/v). The isocratic elution of mobile phase was carried out at a flow rate of 0. 250 [*]mL/min and detection at 220 [*]nm. Both drugs were efficiently separated out in less than 3. 5 [*]min with 1. 1 and 3. 2 [*]min of retention time of the CMF and DCF with 11. 87 of resolution. The linearity was obtained in the 20. 0 – 80. 0 [*]μg/mL range of concentration with 0. 9998 of correlation coefficients for the substances. The method was analyzed for specificity with detailed force degradation study, which is a simple, precise, and accurate method, as per the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines...|$|E
