5|$|The low {{glycaemic}} index treatment (LGIT) {{is an attempt}} to achieve the stable blood glucose levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose {{may be one of the}} mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet, which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content. Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat),</b> the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40–60g per day. However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a {{glycaemic index}} lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.|$|E
5|$|Wilder's colleague, {{paediatrician}} Mynie Peterman, later formulated {{the classic}} diet, with {{a ratio of}} one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight in children, 10–15g of carbohydrate per day, and the remainder of <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat.</b> Peterman's work in the 1920s established the techniques for induction and maintenance of the diet. Peterman documented positive effects (improved alertness, behaviour and sleep) and adverse effects (nausea and vomiting due to excess ketosis). The diet proved to be very successful in children: Peterman reported in 1925 that 95% of 37 young patients had improved seizure control on the diet and 60% became seizure-free. By 1930, the diet had also been studied in 100 teenagers and adults. Clifford Barborka, also from the Mayo Clinic, reported that 56% of those older patients improved on the diet and 12% became seizure-free. Although the adult results are similar to modern studies of children, they did not compare as well to contemporary studies. Barborka concluded that adults were least likely {{to benefit from the}} diet, {{and the use of the}} ketogenic diet in adults was not studied again until 1999.|$|E

25|$|Traditional Inuit diets derive {{approximately}} 50% {{of their}} <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat,</b> 30–35% from protein and 15–20% of their calories from carbohydrates, {{largely in the}} form of glycogen from the raw meat they consumed. This high fat content provides valuable energy and prevents protein poisoning, which historically was sometimes a problem in late winter when game animals grew lean through winter starvation. It has been suggested that because the fats of the Inuit's wild-caught game are largely monounsaturated and rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the diet does not pose the same health risks as a typical Western high-fat diet. However, actual evidence has shown that Inuit have a similar prevalence of coronary artery disease as non-Inuit populations and they have excessive mortality due to cerebrovascular strokes, with twice the risk to that of the North American population. Indeed, the cardiovascular risk of this diet is so severe that the addition of a more standard American diet has reduced the incidence of mortality in Inuit population. Furthermore, fish oil supplement studies have failed to support claims of preventing heart attacks or strokes.|$|E

40|$|Osteoporosis is {{negatively}} correlated with body mass, whereas both osteoporosis and weight loss occur at higher incidence during the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) than the age-matched non-dementia individuals. Given {{that there is no}} evidence that overweight associated with AD-type cognitive dysfunction, we hypothesized that moderate weight gain might have a protective effect on the bone loss in AD without exacerbating cognitive dysfunction. In the present study, feeding a high-fat-diet (HFD, 45 % <b>calorie</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat)</b> to female APP/PS 1 transgenic mice, an AD animal model, induced weight gain. The bone mineral density, microarchitecture, and biomechanical properties of the femurs were then evaluated. The results showed that the middle-aged female APP/PS 1 transgenic mice were susceptible to osteoporosis of the femoral bones and that weight gain significantly enhanced bone mass and mechanical properties. Notably, HFD was not detrimental to brain insulin signaling and AβPP processing, as well as to exploration ability and working, learning and memory performance of the transgenic mice measured by T maze and water maze, compared with the mice fed a normal fat diet (10 % <b>calorie</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat).</b> In addition, the circulating levels of leptin but not estradiol were remarkably elevated in HFD-treated mice. These results suggest that a body weight gain induced by the HFD feeding regimen significantly improved bone mass in female APP/PS 1 mice with no detriments to exploration ability and spatial memory, most likely via the action of elevated circulating leptin...|$|R

50|$|It {{is highly}} {{recommended}} to limit how long one does a PSMF diet for hormonal and energetic reasons. In general, {{people who are}} more obese can stay on the PSMF diet longer {{than those who are}} leaner since their bodies' fat reserves can supply more energy. As one's body fat percentages decrease, it becomes more important to limit the diet to {{no more than a few}} weeks, whereas a very obese person could do it for much longer given proper micronutrient supplementation. Example) A 300-pound person at 40% BF has 120 pounds of fat, and each pound of fat can supply about 31 calories energy to the body/pound of body fat. Thus, this person could theoretically produce up to 31 calories/lb of fat * 120 pounds of <b>fat</b> = 3,720 <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> his <b>fat</b> reserves in a day. A 160-pound person at 10% body fat, however, with 16 pounds of fat could only produce 31 calories/lb of fat * 16 pounds of <b>fat</b> = 496 <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> his <b>fat</b> reserves.|$|R

40|$|Rates of {{overweight}} and obesity {{continue to rise}} each year with serious associated health risks. This {{study was conducted to}} explore gender differences between behavior change variables for both dietary fat reduction and exercise behaviors in a weight loss population. This research also investigated relationships between these psychosocial behavior change variables. Over 300 overweight and obese men and women enrolled in weight loss programs in the greater Boston area completed self-administered surveys. The behavior change variables surveyed included validated Transtheoretical Model (TTM) measures of stage of change for dietary fat reduction, situational confidence and temptation for dietary fat reduction, as well as the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire restraint scale (TFEQ-R). Exercise variables included stage of change and situational confidence. Although significant gender differences were detected by multivariate analysis of variance (p 3 ̆c. 05), weak effect sizes suggest that gender differences for dietary confidence, temptations, or restraint were not clinically relevant. Gender was not found to {{have a significant effect on}} exercise confidence (p 3 ̆e. 05). Stage of change was found to have a significant and strong effect on each of the dietary and exercise behavioral variables under investigation (p 3 ̆c. 05). Through structural equation modeling methods, dietary restraint was found to mediate the effect between the self-efficacy variables of dietary confidence and temptations and percent <b>calorie</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat</b> intake. Restraint, however, was not found to be a moderator or have an interaction effect with self-efficacy variables affecting percent <b>calorie</b> <b>from</b> <b>fat</b> intake. Dietary restraint was not found to be a moderating or mediating variable for the exercise behavior models under investigation. Dietary restraint has not been previously studied with regard to constructs of the TTM. Stage of change was found to have a strong and significant effect on predicting dietary restraint (p 3 ̆c. 001). Results of this study suggests that while men have higher confidence scores and lower scores for temptations and restraint, weight reduction programs do not need to change intervention techniques based on gender. Results also indicate that weight loss programs would benefit from first targeting self-efficacy behaviors which could thereby influence dietary restraint leading to behavior change such as dietary fat reduction. ...|$|R
