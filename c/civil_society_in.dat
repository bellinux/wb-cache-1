5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a <b>civil</b> <b>society,</b> <b>in</b> an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to provide}} a wider understanding of the role of <b>civil</b> <b>societies</b> <b>in</b> Nicaragua and El Salvador.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the importance of <b>civil</b> <b>societies</b> <b>in</b> the transition of El Salvador and Nicaragua, which foster the development and independence of the region. Furthermore, this study attempts to prove that the state, <b>civil</b> <b>societies</b> and the citizens are interconnected in a theoretical perspective which explains the relationship between political, economic, and social structures and the relations with social actors...|$|R

25|$|H.R. 4587 {{would impose}} {{sanctions}} against Venezuela and authorize appropriations to support <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> that country. The bill’s provisions would expire {{two years after}} enactment. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 4587 would cost $7 million over the 2015-2019 period, assuming appropriation of the specified and estimated amounts. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply to this legislation because it would affect direct spending and revenues; however, CBO estimates that those effects would not be significant.|$|E

Other provisions of H.R. 4587 would increase administrative costs of the United States Department of State and the United States Department of the Treasury.

25|$|Unger's {{critique}} of and alternative to social programs {{goes to the}} heart of civil society. The problem we are faced with now, he claims, is that we have a bureaucratic system of distribution that provides lower quality service and prohibits the involvement of <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> the provision of public services. The alternative he lays out is to have the state act to equip civil society to partake in public services and care. This would entail empowering each individual to have two responsibilities, one in the productive economy and one in the caring economy.|$|E

According to Teddy Muhindo Kataliko, president of the <b>Civil</b> <b>Society</b> <b>in</b> Beni Territory, “The population is very hostile to MONUSCO. Firstly because so many people are being killed, but even more so seeing all their arsenal, logistics and soldiers in the area.” This opposition stems from the civilian deaths caused by the Force Intervention Brigade, as well as the failure of the Brigade to eliminate most rebel groups despite long term presence in the region.|$|E

Some corporations and businesses who value good corporate citizenship provide financial support to the projects and/or donate materials for use in construction.

Many museums in Kuwait are private enterprises. In contrast to the top-down approach in other Gulf states, museum development in Kuwait reflects {{a greater sense of}} civic identity and demonstrates the strength of <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> <b>in</b> Kuwait, which has produced many independent cultural enterprises.|$|E
