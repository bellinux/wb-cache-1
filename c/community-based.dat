5|$|Health care {{delivery}} in Nigeria is a concurrent {{responsibility of the}} three tiers of government in the country, and the private sector. Nigeria has been reorganising its health system since the Bamako Initiative of 1987, which formally promoted <b>community-based</b> methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in part by implementing user fees. The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through <b>community-based</b> healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Adolph Sonnabend (born 6 January 1933) is an Afrikaans physician, {{scientist}} and HIV/AIDS researcher, notable for pioneering <b>community-based</b> research, {{the propagation of}} safe sex to prevent infection, and an early multifactorial model of AIDS.|$|E

5|$|A 1994 <b>community-based</b> study {{indicated}} that two out of every 100,000 people suffered from SCSFLS, while a 2004 emergency room-based {{study indicated}} five per 100,000. SCSFLS generally affects the young and middle aged; the average age for onset is 42.3 years, but onset can range from ages 22 to 61. In an 11-year study women {{were found to be}} twice as likely to be affected as men.|$|E
5|$|A {{pioneer of}} <b>community-based</b> {{research}} {{in the absence of}} effective government efforts, Sonnabend also helped to establish the nonprofit Community Research Initiative (CRI, later renamed CRIA, then ACRIA) in New York in 1987. One of CRI's early achievements was a trial that contributed to the approval of inhaled pentamidine for preventing Pneumocystis pneumonia, a common AIDS-related infection. Sonnabend served as Medical Director of CRI/CRIA until 1996.|$|E
5|$|After {{travelling}} in {{the region}} between 2007 and early 2010, Affleck and Whitney Williams co-founded the nonprofit organization Eastern Congo Initiative in 2010.

5|$|The Bundled Measures Policy authorizes {{different}} factions {{within the}} state to collaborate on mitigation projects. This policy takes a more of a <b>community-based</b> approach by adding several groups {{for the purpose of}} multiple perspectives and inventive approaches. The Bundled Measures Policy is one method that generates co-benefits for both parties. In example, if a partaking business were to add cool roofs, there will be a reduction in greenhouse gases which is beneficial for the environment as well as the need for excess energy which is beneficial for the business.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{innovation}} {{initiated by}} a city or a region {{is the creation}} of mixed public-private enterprises for urban water supply that has begun in 1995 in Cartagena, followed by Barranquilla and other Northern and Central cities and towns. Another innovation is an association of <b>community-based</b> organizations (CBOs) providing water supply in rural and peri-urban areas in the departments of El Valle, Cauca and Risaralda in Southwestern Colombia. It began in the late 1990s {{with the assistance of the}} Universidad del Valle in Cali in order to protect and recover source watersheds and to strengthen the CBOs' capacity to administrate, operate and maintain their water systems.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{exercises}} {{were popular}} {{with men and}} wrestling was an important male preoccupation for sport and entertainment. Even women wrestlers are mentioned in records. Gymnasiums have been discovered inside royal quarters and records speak of regular physical training for commanders and their armies during peace time. Royal palaces and market places had special arenas where royalty and common people alike amused themselves by watching matches such as cock fights, ram fights and wrestling between women. Excavations within the Vijayanagara city limits have revealed the existence of various types of <b>community-based</b> activities {{in the form of}} engravings on boulders, rock platforms and temple floors, implying these were places of casual social interaction. Some of these games are in use today and others are yet to be identified.|$|E

In addition, Wade donated some furnishings, clothing, and gifts to the family for the holiday.|$|E
25|$|Community {{practice}} {{in social work}} is linked with the historical roots of the profession's beginning in the United States. More specifically, the history of <b>community-based</b> social work has evolved from the Charity Organization Society (COS) and the settlement house movements. However, during the earlier half of the 20th century, much of this work targeted the mentally ill and focused on institutionalization. Not until the 1960s did the shift from institutions to communities, known as deinstitutionalization, increase the emphasis on <b>community-based</b> program design. <b>Community-based</b> organizations and <b>community-based</b> programs burgeoned because of this. The poor conditions of mental health institutions and an increasing amount of research that illustrated the benefits of maintaining the relationships of the individuals served within the community surfaced to further the growth of <b>community-based</b> programs.|$|E
25|$|Assistance to <b>community-based</b> service {{providers}} {{is a key}} function {{in the water and}} sanitation sector. In Guatemala this function is not clearly assigned to a government institution. INFOM, through UNEPAR (see above under policy), does provide this function. In addition, many NGOs also support <b>community-based</b> organizations.|$|E
25|$|In Nepal, a <b>community-based</b> {{participatory}} {{intervention to}} identify local birthing problems and formulating strategies {{has been shown}} to be effective in reducing both neonatal and maternal mortality in a rural population. <b>Community-based</b> programs in Malaysia and Sri Lanka that used well-trained midwives as front-line health workers also produced rapid declines in maternal mortality.|$|E
25|$|Benefits of <b>community-based</b> program design include gaining {{insight into}} {{the social context of}} an issue or problem, mutual {{learning}} experiences between consumer and provider, broadening understanding of professional roles and responsibilities within the community, interaction with professionals from other disciplines, and opportunities for <b>community-based</b> participatory research projects. Increased sustainability is an advantage of <b>community-based</b> program design. The program sustainability is ensured by the identification of solutions to problems based on existing resources accessible to all community members. Also, the involvement of local community leaders and local volunteers reinforce the sustainability {{of the impact of the}} program.|$|E

25|$|Similar to {{traditional}} program design, <b>community-based</b> program design often utilizes {{a range of}} tools and models which are meant to enhance the efficacy and outcomes of the program’s design. The difference between traditional design and <b>community-based</b> design, when using these tools, is in {{the dynamics of the}} relationship between the designers, the participants, and the community as a whole. It evolved from the Charity Organization Society (COS) and the settlement house movements.|$|E

25|$|<b>Community-based</b> program {{design is}} a social method for {{designing}} programs that enables social service providers, organizers, designers and evaluators to serve specific communities in their own environment. This program design method depends on the participatory approach of community development often associated with <b>community-based</b> social work, and is often employed by community organizations. From this approach, program designers assess the needs and resources existing within a community, and, involving community stakeholders in the process, {{attempt to create a}} sustainable and equitable solution to address the community's needs.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to large-scale solutions {{there are also}} several <b>community-based</b> approaches aiming at a more sustainable use of Jordan’s water resources. An important fosterer of these small-scale <b>community-based</b> approaches is the “Community Based Initiatives for Water Demand Management Project” (CBIWD), a project organised by the Ministry of Water and Irrigation in cooperation with Mercy Corps, the Jordan River Foundation and the Royal Scientific Society which is supported by USAID. The CBIWD supports a variety of project types, among them e.g. rainwater harvesting and greywater reuse projects.|$|E
