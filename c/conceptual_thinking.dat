25|$|Reform {{mathematics}} is {{an approach to}} mathematics education, particularly in North America. It is based on principles explained in 1989 by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). The NCTM document, Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, attempted to set forth a vision for K-12 (ages 5-18) mathematics education in the United States and Canada. Their recommendations were adopted by many education agencies, from local to federal levels through the 1990s. In 2000, NCTM revised its standards {{with the publication of}} Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (PSSM). Like the first publication, these updated standards have continued to {{serve as the basis for}} many states' mathematics standards, and for many federally funded textbook projects. The first standards gave a strong call for a de-emphasis on manual arithmetic in favor of students' discovering their own knowledge and <b>conceptual</b> <b>thinking.</b> The PSSM has taken a more balanced view, but still emphasizes <b>conceptual</b> <b>thinking</b> and problem solving.|$|E
500|$|<b>Conceptual</b> <b>thinking</b> about throffers is {{practically}} applied in considerations of conditional aid, such as {{is used in}} workfare systems. For philosopher and political theorist Gertrude Ezorsky, the denial of welfare when subjects refuse work {{is the epitome of}} a throffer. Conditional welfare is also labelled a throffer by political philosopher Robert Goodin. In the words of Daniel Shapiro, also a political philosopher, the offer aspect of workfare is seen in the [...] "benefits one receives if one learns new skills, gets a job, alters destructive behaviors and the like", while the threat aspect is executed with [...] "the elimination or reduction of aid, if the person does not, after a certain period of time, accept the offer". For Goodin, the moral questionability of the threat aspect of a throffer is generally mitigated by the attractiveness of the offer aspect. In this way, workfare can represent a [...] "genuine" [...] throffer, but only when a person receiving welfare payments does not need the payments to survive, and so possesses a genuine choice as to whether to accept the throffer. When, however, an individual would be unable to survive if he or she stopped receiving welfare payments, there is no genuine choice; the individual is, for Goodin, unable to refuse the throffer. This cancels out the morally mitigating factor usually possessed by a throffer. This is presented as an argument against workfare, and Goodin anticipates that advocates would respond paternalistically by claiming that, regardless of issues of freedom, the individual in question would benefit from taking part in the work or education offered.|$|E
2500|$|A koan (literally [...] "public case") is a {{story or}} dialogue, {{generally}} related to Chan or other Buddhist history; the most typical form is an anecdote involving early Chinese Chan masters. These anecdotes involving famous Chan teachers are a practical demonstration of their wisdom, {{and can be used}} to test a student's progress in Chan practice. Koans often appear to be paradoxical or linguistically meaningless dialogues or questions. But to Chan Buddhists the koan is [...] "the place and the time and the event where truth reveals itself" [...] unobstructed by the oppositions and differentiations of language. Answering a koan requires a student to let go of <b>conceptual</b> <b>thinking</b> and of the logical way we order the world, so that, like creativity in art, the appropriate insight and response arises naturally and spontaneously in the mind.|$|E

2500|$|Education theorist Bill Ayers has {{commented on}} the {{limitations}} of the standardized test, writing that [...] "Standardized tests can't measure initiative, creativity, imagination, <b>conceptual</b> <b>thinking,</b> curiosity, effort, irony, judgment, commitment, nuance, good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes. What they can measure and count are isolated skills, specific facts and function, content knowledge, the least interesting and least significant aspects of learning." [...] In his book, The Shame of the Nation, Jonathan Kozol argues that students submitted to standardized testing are victims of [...] "cognitive decapitation." [...] Kozol comes to this realization after speaking to many children in inner city schools who have no spatial recollection of time, time periods, and historical events. This is especially the case in schools where due to shortages in funding and strict accountability policies, schools have done away with subjects like the arts, history and geography; in order to focus on the contest of the mandated tests.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I offer an exegetical account of Martin Heidegger’s 1951 / 1952 lecture course Was Heisst Denken?. My {{reading of the}} text is based on two {{essential}} tenets Heidegger puts forward in Was Heisst Denken?: that there cannot be a <b>conceptual</b> definition of <b>thinking</b> and that thinking begins by attending to the unfolding of language from the Ereignis. Thus the thesis aims to show how Heidegger’s teaching of thinking takes place largely through attending to the unfolding of language, which seeks to interrupt the <b>conceptual</b> and representational <b>thinking</b> of metaphysics through challenging its instrumental use of language. Heidegger’s development {{of a notion of}} thinking does thus largely take place through a critique of traditional forms of thinking by seeking to find an entry within metaphysics to that which calls forth thinking, which he names as the twofold of being. As Heidegger presents the lecture course as a concerted effort to learn thinking, the structure of the thesis follows the structure of the lecture course itself, in order to show how the momentum of Heidegger’s text builds up through a consistent introduction of difference through language, in order to allow the reader to hear the difference {{at the heart of the}} Ereignis itself. To show this my reading is based on the German text rather than its English translation, in order to highlight how Heidegger works with the particularity of the German language in order to find and instil difference within the <b>conceptual</b> and representational <b>thinking</b> of metaphysics...|$|R

5000|$|Articulation {{includes}} [...] "any {{method of}} getting students to articulate their knowledge, reasoning, or problem-solving {{process in a}} domain" [...] (p. 482). Three types of articulation are inquiry teaching, thinking aloud, and critical student role. Through inquiry teaching (Collins & Stevens, 1982), teachers ask students {{a series of questions}} that allows them to refine and restate their learned knowledge and to form explicit <b>conceptual</b> models. <b>Thinking</b> aloud requires students to articulate their thoughts while solving problems. Students assuming a critical role monitor others in cooperative activities and draw conclusions based on the problem-solving activities. Articulation is described by McLellan as consisting of two aspects: separating component knowledge and skills to learn them more effectively and, more common verbalizing or demonstrating knowledge and thinking processes in order to expose and clarify them.|$|R
