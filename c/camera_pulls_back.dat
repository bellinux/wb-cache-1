He finishes dressing for the fight and, as {{he walks to the}} ring, hears Stephanie calling to him. He turns to her; they smile. He resumes his walk to the ring and the <b>camera</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> to reveal that he is dressed in Marty's old ring robe in tribute.|$|E
5|$|Their mission completed, Gabe and Lian {{call in the}} U.S. Army Chemical and Biological Defense Command (CBDC) {{to secure}} the area. They {{do not know how}} far Markinson was {{cooperating}} with Rhoemer and Phagan, but Gabe believes they may never know. In a post-credits scene, Aramov approaches a mysterious man inside the Agency headquarters and whispers something in his ear. He congratulates her while the <b>camera</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> to show PharCom boxes in the office.|$|E
5|$|Though different, the children's stories {{share similar}} structures. The story reaches its climax as a {{stairway}} {{appears at the}} Dream Gate and Helen and Nights ascend, only to be trapped by Wizeman and pulled into darkness. Will arrives too late and dives in after them, arriving in the night skies above Bellbridge, where he finds {{that he has the}} ability to fly without Nights or their Ideya. He rescues Helen, and the two attempt to save Nights, who has been imprisoned at the top of Bellbridge's clock tower. Reala arrives to stop their efforts and accepts Nights' challenge to battle. After defeating Reala, the trio prepare to face Wizeman. Both Will and Helen defeat Wizeman, who is subsequently destroyed. Since Wizeman kept all of his creations alive, Nights vanishes in a white light, bowing as if it were the end of a performance, and the children wake up crying. That evening, Helen plays her violin for her mother in a crowded hall, while Will celebrates with his father after winning a football game. He then loses the ball and goes after it, only to come upon Helen playing her violin. The lights suffer a temporary blackout, and when they turn back on, Helen sees Will extending a friendly hand to her. Recognising each other from their adventures in Nightopia, the two reach for each other as it begins to snow. The final scene is of either child sleeping in their rooms at home as the <b>camera</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> towards Bellbridge's clock tower, atop which Nights is seen to be alive and peacefully watching over the city.|$|E

But when Roger buys cheap supplies to pocket the cash difference for drugs and girls, resulting {{in the death of}} a family of birds, Steve breaks up their partnership. Roger later arrives and claims to have cleaned up his act. As they bid each other farewell, Steve gives a voice over monologue that he knew Roger was faking it and within minutes he died of a drug overdose, the <b>camera</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> to show Roger on the kitchen floor.|$|R

One of the firemen finds that his parents' new toaster oven caused the fire. As Kevin recovers, he finds one of the firemen resembles Agamemnon and {{discover}}s that {{he still has the}} photos from his adventure. Kevin's parents discover a smouldering rock in the toaster oven. Recognizing it as a piece of Evil, Kevin warns them not to touch it. Ignoring him, they touch it then explode, leaving two piles of ash. Kevin tentatively approaches the smoking ash and is seen from above as his figure grows smaller, the <b>camera</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> to reveal the planet and then outer space, before being rolled up in the map by the Supreme Being.|$|R

After a few {{close-up}} shots of the rapper's surroundings, Brambilla's <b>camera</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> and everyone disappears, leaving only West and the two warriors. Realization dawns that they aren't swinging at each other, but rather converging on King Kanye. But before they can decapitate him, however, the video cuts to black." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Terry Gilliam would {{praise the}} film as [...] "a work of genius. It got people to {{understand}} what toys are about. They're true to their own character. And that's just brilliant. It's got a shot that's always stuck with me, when Buzz Lightyear discovers he's a toy. He's sitting on this landing {{at the top of}} the staircase and the <b>camera</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> and he's this tiny little figure. He was this guy with a massive ego two seconds before... and it's stunning. I'd put that as one of my top ten films, period." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's title {{sequence}} is a 90-second visual effects composition that depicts {{the inside of}} the Narrator's brain at a microscopic level; the <b>camera</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> to the outside, starting at his fear center and following the thought processes initiated by his fear impulse. The sequence, designed in part by Fincher, was budgeted separately {{from the rest of the}} film at first, but the sequence was awarded by the studio in January 1999. Fincher hired Digital Domain and its visual effects supervisor Kevin Mack, who won an Academy Award for Visual Effects for the 1998 film What Dreams May Come, for the sequence. The company mapped the computer-generated brain using an L-system, and the design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator Katherine Jones. The pullback sequence from within the brain to the outside of the skull included neurons, action potentials, and a hair follicle. Haug explained the artistic license that Fincher took with the shot, [...] "While he wanted to keep the brain passage looking like electron microscope photography, that look had to be coupled with the feel of a night dive—wet, scary, and with a low depth of field." [...] The shallow depth of field was accomplished with the ray tracing process.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, Omar Qureshi of Zoom rated Prince 2.5 out of 5 saying, [...] "The film {{is over the}} top and unrealistic." [...] Indiatimes.com rated it 2 out of 5 stars saying, [...] "The film has taken the {{audience}} for granted, which shows us gadgets hard to believe and futuristic and that such futuristic shows should be limited to Hollywood.". Subhash K. Jha gave 2 out of 5 stars, and said, [...] "Prince wears its super-cool shirt with the slogan ‘Come Watch Me’ with a little bit too much aggression. But if you love popcorn crunching adventure stories watch Vivek Oberoi play the hero from the hemisphere of hijinks." [...] He praised Oberoi's acting and the action sequences, saying that [...] "To his credit Oberoi carries off the ceaseless stint with the stunt with arresting aplomb...The expertly-executed stunts frequently see our hero jumping down high-rise buildings in breathtaking leaps of fate, with the <b>camera</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> in respectful awe." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} was filmed in February 1995 by {{director}} Nick Egan, and first aired in March. It featured the band with their instruments {{inside the box}} of a sound stage lined with vivid red walls, and the video is intensely saturated, even overexposed at times. Clips of a melancholy Simon Le Bon singing, and other band members performing or reacting to the lyrics, are interspersed with snippets of surreal images. The <b>camera</b> occasionally <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> to show the entire stage structure and its supports, increasing the sense of unreality.|$|R
500|$|The last scene filmed was the film's first, Picard's Borg nightmare. One {{camera shot}} begins inside the iris of Picard's eyeball and <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> {{to reveal the}} captain aboard a massive Borg ship. The shot {{continues}} to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> and reveal the exterior of a Borg ship. The scene {{was inspired by a}} New York City production of Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street in which the stage surrounded the audience, giving a sense of realism. The shot was filmed as three separate elements merged with digital effects. The crew used a 50-mm lens {{to make it easier for}} the effects team to dissolve the closeup shots with the other elements. Starting from Stewart's eye, the <b>camera</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>back</b> , requiring the key light to increase in intensity up to 1000footcandles so that there was enough depth to keep the eye sharp. The surface of the stage proved too uneven to accomplish the smooth dolly pullback required by the effects team, who needed a steady shot to blend a computer-generated version of Picard's eye with the pullback. The [...] dolly track was raised off the stage floor and layered with pieces of double-thick birch plywood, chosen for its smooth finish. The entire set for the scene was [...] wide and [...] high; gaps left by the dolly reveal were filled in later digitally. Principal photography finished on July 2, 1996, two days over schedule but still under budget.|$|R
500|$|David Lynch uses various {{methods of}} {{deception}} in Mulholland Drive. A shadowy figure named Mr. Roque, {{who seems to}} control film studios, is portrayed by dwarf actor Michael J. Anderson (also from Twin Peaks). Anderson, who has only two lines and is seated in an enormous wooden wheelchair, was fitted with oversized foam prosthetic arms and legs in order to portray his head as abnormally small. During Adam and Camilla's party, Diane watches Camilla (played by Harring) with Adam on one arm, lean over and deeply kiss the same woman who appeared as Camilla (Melissa George) before the blue box was opened. Both then turn and smile pointedly at Diane. Film critic Franklin Ridgway writes that the depiction of such a deliberate [...] "cruel and manipulative" [...] act makes it unclear if Camilla is as capricious as she seems, or if Diane's paranoia is allowing the audience only {{to see what she}} senses. In a scene immediately after Betty's audition, the film cuts to a woman singing without apparent accompaniment, but as the camera pulls backwards, the audience sees that it is a recording studio. In actuality, it is a sound stage where Betty has just arrived to meet Adam Kesher, that the audience realizes as the <b>camera</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> further. Ridgway insists that such deception through artful camera work sets the viewer full of doubt about what is being presented: [...] "It is as if the camera, in its graceful fluidity of motion, reassures us that it (thinks it) sees everything, has everything under control, even if we (and Betty) do not." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Angus burger adverts {{featured}} a man (played by Richard Bennett) {{asking for an}} Angus Burger in a 'FastBurger' restaurant - a parody of McDonald's - and the counter staff laughing, presumably because they didn't think you could buy one in a fast food restaurant. The news of the order reaches the FastBurger headquarters and everyone associated with the fictional chain is laughing. The chairman is by now laughing after being told about the order on the phone, and says [...] "An Angus Burger, is he crazy?!" [...] An assistant gives him the morning Evening Standard paper and the front page story reads 'Burger King Debuts The Angus". Then the <b>camera</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> through the office to reveal a real Angus Burger and the announcer says [...] "The Angus Burger, only at Burger King".|$|E
2500|$|Episode 1 {{begins with}} a pre-credits sequence, {{the only one of}} the TV episodes to have one. A {{countdown}} to the end of the world is displayed through animation, and the narrator begins telling the story of the Guide and Arthur Dent's connection to it as the sun rises over the English countryside for the final time. Arthur wakes, discovers the threat to his house from a yellow bulldozer by looking out the window, and the <b>camera</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> to the titles. This episode closely follows the plot and dialogue of the first episode of the radio series, cutting the speech by Lady Cynthia Fitzmelton. It ends at a slightly earlier point than the radio episode, after Ford's line [...] "he might want to read us some of his poetry first", and on a cliffhanger that Arthur and Ford are about to be discovered in a Vogon storeroom, but before the Vogon poetry is actually read.|$|E

The surface of the stage proved too uneven to accomplish the smooth dolly pullback required by the effects team, who needed a steady shot to blend a computer-generated version of Picard's eye with the pullback. The 135 ft dolly track was raised off the stage floor and layered with pieces of double-thick birch plywood, chosen for its smooth finish. The entire set for the scene was 100 ft wide and 25 ft high; gaps left by the dolly reveal were filled in later digitally. Principal photography finished on July 2, 1996, two days over schedule but still under budget.|$|R
50|$|Rosefeldt’s work {{consists}} {{primarily of}} elaborate, visually opulent {{film and video}} installations. In most cases, these installations are shown as panoramic multi-channel projections. They range in style from documentary to theatrical narrative. In Lonely Planet (2006), for example, the artist portrays a hippie-ish Western backpacker on a trip through India; as he moves {{through a series of}} clichéd sequences, including a frenetic Bollywood-inspired dance number, the <b>camera</b> periodically <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> to reveal spotlights, dressing rooms and other filmmaking necessities. Rosefeldt primarily uses 16-mm and 35-mm film and has often worked in close cooperation with the cinematographer Christoph Krauss.|$|R
5000|$|Now the {{audience}} hears sound {{for the second}} time, as the film starts rolling for a dance scene with Peppy and Valentin and their tap-dancing can be heard. Once the choreography is complete, the two dancers are heard panting. The director of the musical calls out audibly, [...] "Cut!" [...] to which Zimmer adds: [...] "Perfect. Beautiful. Could you give me one more?" [...] Valentin, in his only audible line, replies [...] "With pleasure!" [...] revealing his French accent. The <b>camera</b> then <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> {{to the sounds of}} the film crew as they prepare to shoot another take.|$|R
2500|$|The {{video for}} the song was filmed near Slough, Berkshire, during November 1981 and has {{the theme of the}} filming and editing of a murder-mystery film, {{featuring}} the band members as characters and production staff. [...] Due to it being a [...] "making of" [...] video, both crew and camera apparatus appear throughout. It was conceived and directed by filmmaker Steve Barron, and has at its core the interaction between a successful actress (also a 2nd negative cutter) played by Susan Ann Sulley walking out on [...] "film director" [...] Philip Oakey on a film set. [...] It is loosely based on the film A Star Is Born. Near the end of the video, Wright, who also plays a film editor, has an expression on his face, while the <b>camera</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> to reveal that the negative room where Oakey, Wright, and Sulley were working in is yet another set (the camera {{can be seen in the}} mirror's reflection).|$|E
2500|$|Season three saw the {{directing}} {{debut of}} one of the show’s developers, Miles Millar, who got to direct the episode [...] "Memoria". Welling describes Millar’s style as very succinct, to which he credits to Millar’s background of writing for all of the characters on the show. As Welling explains, Millar managed to capture the same effect as other directors, but with fewer words. Millar’s visual style, at least for this episode, tended to lean more to applying [...] "extreme lighting" [...] to the scenes, to create silhouettes of the characters. Miles Millar was inspired by the film Kings Row when he filmed the scene for Lex’s birthday party as a child. In the scene, a <b>camera</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> from a flashback transition to reveal a young Lex sitting alone at a large table full of food and gifts. Instead of using the same techniques that were employed in previous episodes for transitioning between the present and the past, Millar decided to shift between the two time frames by transitioning between the older Lex and the younger Lex. This required Rosenbaum to rely more on Millar’s direction, so that the emotional level was matched between himself and the young actor portraying Lex, Wayne Dalglish. One particular scene seemed to provide Millar with the most trouble, mainly because of the constraints of the film division at Warner Bros. In the scene, Jor-El and Lara are placing the infant Kal-El into his spaceship during Krypton’s final moments. At the time, Warner Bros. was working on a new Superman film, and {{it was going to be}} an origin story. This affected how much Smallville could actually show. The film department prohibited Millar from showing Krypton, or Jor-El and Lara. As a result, Millar took inspiration from a comic book written by Jeph Loeb. In Loeb’s book, Jor-El and Lara are depicted as just a pair of hands holding on to each other after they place Kal-El into his spaceship.|$|E

5000|$|An anti-war message also {{unusual for}} the time period - and {{particularly}} regarding America's involvement in the Second World War - {{is found in the}} final vignette. An American soldier (co-star George Hamilton) stationed in post-war Berlin picks a fight with a drunken Soviet soldier (Albert Finney), possibly to avenge the rape of his German girlfriend by Soviet soldiers during the Battle of Berlin. The fight ends with each man killing the other and the <b>camera</b> slowly <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> to show the bodies of the two one-time allies lying {{in the shape of a}} [...] "V" [...] for victory in a seemingly limitless desert of rubble and ruins.|$|R
5000|$|On Rotten Tomatoes, {{the film}} {{received}} {{a rating of}} 0%, based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 1.7/10. On Metacritic, the film received a rating of 18 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating [...] "overwhelming dislike". New York Times film critic Ben Kenigsberg said that Cameron's acting [...] "sounds so forced you half-expect the <b>camera</b> to <b>pull</b> <b>back</b> to reveal hostage takers". Billings Gazette named it the worst Christmas movie of all time in 2016, and Will Nicol of Digital Trends included it on his list of the ten worst movies ever made. Christy Lemire picked Saving Christmas as the worst film she has ever reviewed.|$|R
5000|$|Marshall tells Lily that GNB {{has offered}} him a five-year contract. Lily, however, is still firm on her belief that Marshall will resign and pursue his dream of being an {{environmental}} lawyer. Lily also realizes that whenever she had asked Marshall about whether he would quit his job at GNB, he always responded with made-up words {{so that he could}} not be held culpable as a liar. In the ensuing argument, Marshall insists on staying in the company for financial reasons, and Lily storms out; she feels he hasn't stayed true to himself and their values. While {{in another part of the}} museum, Lily visualizes an exhibit showing extinct [...] "College Marshall" [...] at their old Wesleyan dorm. She talks with College Marshall, telling him that his persona was the one she fell in love with many years ago and [...] "Corporate" [...] Marshall embodied everything he despised. However, College Marshall tells her that while Corporate Marshall may have changed in a few ways, he hasn't changed where it counts. Just then, the real Marshall appears and promises to work harder to provide a stable future for their family. Future Ted later reveals that Marshall does leave GNB in the future (with the <b>camera</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>back</b> to reveal an exhibit showing extinct Corporate Marshall), but the episode ends with Future Ted just saying, [...] "but that's another story".|$|R

One day, Rusk shows up at her office and tries to seduce her; when she spurns his advances, he rapes and strangles her {{in a fit of}} rage. Suspicion falls on Blaney, who is previously seen threatening his ex-wife in public, as well as being seen leaving her building shortly after her murder. The subsequent murder of Blaney's girlfriend, Barbara [...] "Babs" [...] Milligan (Anna Massey), occurs off-screen: the audience sees her entering Rusk's apartment with him, but the <b>camera</b> then <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> down the stairs {{all the way out to}} the other side of the street.|$|R

Nagle corners and beats Margaret but Alek arrives and the two men scuffle, and Alek strangles Nagle. Margaret attempts to take responsibility for Nagle's death, but Alek takes the body away in Nagle's car. As Margaret and her son drive looking for Nagle's car, they see it overturned in a ditch. Margaret attempts to free Alek, who is critically injured. Alek pleads with her to leave before the police arrive. Margaret stays until Alek dies. Back at home, Margaret, in a state of distress, is comforted by Beau.

During one episode they actually managed to get dates, but insisted on leaving because the men did not offer to buy them a drink. Their catchphrase is: [...] "In your dreams, buddy!" [...] This can be varied, for example, in a Christmas sketch, when acting as Santa's assistants, they say to a little boy, [...] "In your dreams, very small buddy!" [...] Nina Wadia said on the BBC documentary Comedy Connections that Meera Syal was behind the creation of these characters and is one of Nina's favourites on the series.

A cyclist cycles past in reverse and Martin leaps up from the mattress. He walks in reverse through a city, out into the suburbs and eventually crossing a railway line [...] and into woods, picking up his suit jacket as he goes. Upon arriving at his car, a black BMW, he gets in and briefly passes out. A woman, at first shown lying unresponsive {{on the ground in}} front of the car, is shown flying back in through the shattered windscreen. The car rolls back up a hill in the woods and through a broken fence, which joins back together as the car passes through it. As the video closes, the couple is shown driving back up the road. It is revealed that Martin's passenger had removed her seat belt, in order to put her jacket on, just before the car accident, causing her death. Irish actress Elaine Cassidy portrays the female passenger.|$|R

Jake then gambled with the money in Las Vegas, yielding $2.5 million in winnings. After Jake leaves, Alan and Walden are contacted by Wagner, who informs them that he has captured Charlie, but the camera reveals that the man is actually Christian Slater, dressed in clothing similar to Charlie's. Alan, Walden, and Berta (Conchata Ferrell), now believing that Charlie is in jail, celebrate by relaxing in lounge chairs while smoking Charlie's cigars and drinking his whiskey, {{when they see a}} helicopter carrying a grand piano, similar to the one Charlie used to play, approaching the house. The three ponder if Wagner caught the right man, but quickly brush it off. Charlie, shown only from the back, approaches the beach house and rings the bell, but before anyone answers the door he is killed when the helicopter drops the piano on him. The <b>camera</b> then <b>pulls</b> <b>back</b> to reveal the series' set and Chuck Lorre, sitting in the director's chair.

The Earth goes up for auction with the Moon serving as auctioneer and the planets start bidding, singing {{to the tune of}} [...] "London Bridge Is Falling Down". Mars and Venus bid first, but Saturn is the eventual buyer. He pulls a large horse-shoe magnet out from the Earth, eliminating the planet's gravity, just to see what happens. Buildings, trees, animals, and people including Betty start floating into the air with humorous effect. Finally a hand reaches out from the Earth and grabs the magnet back from Saturn.
