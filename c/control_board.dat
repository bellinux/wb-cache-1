5|$|In 2001, Ahmedabad {{was ranked}} {{as the most}} {{polluted}} city in India, out of 85 cities, by the Central Pollution <b>Control</b> <b>Board.</b> The Gujarat Pollution <b>Control</b> <b>Board</b> gave auto rickshaw drivers an incentive of 10,000 to convert all 37,733 auto rickshaws in Ahmedabad to cleaner burning compressed natural gas to reduce pollution.

5|$|However, the San Diego Regional Water Quality <b>Control</b> <b>Board</b> {{withheld}} its {{permit approval}} in December 2000, over {{concerns that the}} Sweetwater Reservoir could be polluted in the process. Such an approval was necessary under the Clean Water Act {{in order to get}} the necessary approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The suit by Preserve South Bay was dismissed in March 2001, on the grounds that the legislature did not need to review the annexation of state parkland for the highway because it was done under eminent domain. In April, the San Diego Regional Water Quality <b>Control</b> <b>Board</b> approved the project on several conditions, including monitoring the water quality to ensure that the Sweetwater Reservoir would remain a clean water source for local residents. An appeal to the state Water Resources <b>Control</b> <b>Board</b> to overturn the approval was unsuccessful. In July, the USACE approved the wetlands permit for the southern portion of SR 125.|$|E

40|$|The nation's current {{recession}} has strained the finances of local governments such that many cities with already delicate budgets have plunged into fiscal crisis. This dissertation examines three causes of fiscal crisis- a local government's {{dependence on the}} market, majoritarian tyranny within federalism, and local democracy failure. Since New York City's highly publicized board in 1975, 119 municipalities of all sizes have been assigned <b>control</b> <b>boards,</b> in which a state appointed team oversees the budgetary decisions of a municipality in fiscal emergency. This study analyzes how <b>control</b> <b>boards</b> address each cause of fiscal crisis. This research builds on the fiscal crisis literature to measure the fiscal impact of <b>control</b> <b>boards.</b> Evidence suggests that boards were implemented in most large cities with fiscal crisis and that those cities recover. However, crisis cities without <b>control</b> <b>boards</b> also improve. Regressions indicate that <b>control</b> <b>boards</b> in municipalities with populations below 25, 000 are less successful. The <b>control</b> <b>boards</b> are not assigned to municipalities that most need intervention, {{and they do not}} improve fiscal outcomes more than similar cities...|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1946, the Montreal Laboratory was {{estimated}} to have cost US$22,232,000, excluding {{the cost of the}} heavy water. The NRX reactor provided Britain, the United States and Canada with a source of fissile plutonium and uranium-233. It also provided a means of efficiently producing medical isotopes like phosphorus-32, research facilities that for a time were superior to those in the United States, and a wealth of technical information related to reactor design and operation. With the passage of the Canadian Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the responsibility for the Chalk River Laboratories passed to the Atomic Energy <b>Control</b> <b>Board.</b>|$|E

However, his tenure was marked by conflict with Lloyd George and in August 1917, having received little support from the Prime Minister, Chamberlain resigned. The relationship between Chamberlain and Lloyd George would be one thenceforth of hatred.|$|E

5|$|NBN's {{original}} owner, the Newcastle Broadcasting and Television Corporation (NBTC) {{was founded}} in May 1958 to begin preparations for the upcoming television licence allocations.

In accordance with the Australian Broadcasting <b>Control</b> <b>Board</b> regulations, at least 50% of the company had to be locally owned. 750,000 shares were made available by the NBTC (at 10 shillings, equivalent to A$1 each). Approximately 2000 people bought shares.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Sinatra {{bought a}} share in the Cal Neva Lodge & Casino, a casino hotel which {{straddles}} the California-Nevada state line on the north shores of Lake Tahoe. Though it only opened between June and September, Sinatra built the Celebrity Room theater, which attracted the Sinatra show business pals, Red Skelton, Marilyn Monroe, Victor Borge, Joe E. Lewis, Lucille Ball, Lena Horne, Juliet Prowse, the McGuire Sisters and others. By 1962 he reportedly held a 50% share in the hotel. Sinatra's gambling license was temporarily stripped by the Nevada Gaming <b>Control</b> <b>Board</b> in 1963 after Giancana was spotted on the premises. Due to ongoing pressure from the FBI and Nevada Gaming Commission on mobster control of casinos, Sinatra agreed to give up his share in Cal Neva and the Sands. That year, Sinatra's son, Frank Sinatra, Jr., was kidnapped, but was eventually released unharmed. Sinatra restored his gaming license in February 1981, following support from Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|The dam {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the 1950s; construction work commenced in 1968, involving the diversion of the North Fork American River through a tunnel {{and the construction of}} a massive earthen cofferdam. Following a nearby earthquake and the discovery of a seismic fault that underlay the dam site, work on the project was halted for fears that the dam's design would not allow it to survive a major quake on the same fault zone. Although the dam was redesigned and a new proposal submitted by 1980, spiraling costs and limited economic justification {{put an end to the}} project until severe flooding in 1986 briefly renewed interest in Auburn's flood control potential. The California State Water Resources <b>Control</b> <b>Board</b> denied water rights for the dam project in 2008 due to lack of construction progress.|$|E
5|$|Under Sinatra, the Celebrity Room {{was added}} {{alongside}} a helipad and it opened year round.

But Giancana's attendance at the property first provoked a rift between Sinatra and share holder Hank Sanicola, and later resulted in Sinatra's gambling license being suspended by the Nevada Gaming <b>Control</b> <b>Board.</b> He initially leased the property to Jack L. Warner and later in 1968 {{to a group of}} investors. It passed through the hands of a series of investment groups until 1976 when it was bought by Kirk Kerkorian. The property closed for renovations in 2013 and has not reopened since. Larry Ellison made a winning bid to purchase the property out of bankruptcy in 2017.|$|E
