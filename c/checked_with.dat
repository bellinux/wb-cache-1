5|$|Since {{the first}} modern {{measurements}} of the precise cardinal orientations of the pyramids by Flinders Petrie, various astronomical methods have been proposed for the original establishment of these orientations. It was recently proposed that this was done by observing the positions of two stars in the Plough / Big Dipper which was known to Egyptians as the thigh. It is thought that a vertical alignment between these two stars <b>checked</b> <b>with</b> a plumb bob was used to ascertain where north lay. The deviations from true north using this model reflect the accepted dates of construction.|$|E

A further check of a Bisbee corral turned up both Spence and Stilwell, who were arrested by sheriff's deputies Billy Breakenridge and Nagel.|$|E

5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved if they had not realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had <b>checked</b> <b>with</b> every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June Burke and McDougal {{departed}} for Falkirk {{to visit the}} latter's father. Burke knew that Hare was short of cash and had even pawned some of his clothes. When the couple returned, they found that Hare was wearing new clothes and had surplus money. After he was asked, Hare denied that he had sold another body. Burke <b>checked</b> <b>with</b> Knox, who confirmed Hare had sold a woman's body for £8. It led to an argument {{between the two men}} and they came to blows. Burke and his wife moved into the home of his cousin, John Broggan (or Brogan), two streets away from Tanner's Close.|$|E

25|$|Capitalization of answer letters is {{conventionally}} ignored; {{crossword puzzles}} are typically filled in, and their answer sheets are almost universally published, in all caps, {{except in the}} rare cases of ambigrams.

Diacritical markings in foreign loanwords (or foreign-language words appearing in English-language puzzles) are ignored for similar reasons.|$|E

A microform cleft can appear {{as small as a}} little dent in the red part of the lip or look like a scar from the lip up to the nostril. In some cases muscle tissue in the lip underneath the scar is affected and might require reconstructive surgery. It is advised to have newborn infants with a microform cleft <b>checked</b> <b>with</b> a craniofacial team as soon as possible to determine the severity of the cleft.|$|E

The car on display was nearly identical to the 2CV type A that would be sold the next year, but it lacked an electric starter, the addition of which was decided {{the day before the}} opening of the Salon, replacing the pull cord starter. The canvas roof could be rolled completely open. The Type A had one stop light, and was only available in grey. The fuel level was <b>checked</b> <b>with</b> a dip stick/measuring rod, and the speedometer was attached to the windscreen pillar. The only other instrument was an ammeter.|$|E

While the deputation was still with him, his brother's positive reply arrived and Scott thus consented to become a candidate. Scott was Seddon's preferred candidate for the Liberal Party, as {{he was also a}} prohibitionist and would thus draw votes from Tommy Taylor, whom Seddon tried to keep out of Parliament.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} program <b>checking</b> <b>with</b> certificates {{by extending}} the traditional notion of black-box program checking. Moreover, we establish program <b>checking</b> <b>with</b> certificates as a safety-scalable and practical method {{to ensure the}} correctness of real-scale applications. We motivate our extension of program <b>checking</b> <b>with</b> concepts of computational complexity theory and show its practical implication on the implementation and verification of checkers. Furthermore, we present an iterative method to construct checkers which is {{able to deal with}} the practically relevant problem of incomplete or missing specifications of software. In our case study, we have considered compilers and their generators, in particular code generators based on rewrite systems...|$|R
25|$|The {{boat was}} {{calibrated}} {{by measuring the}} height of the gunwales above water level at each corner with the boat unladen and then measured again when known weights had been loaded into the boat from an overhead gantry. These measurements were logged in toll-keeper's tables and copies sent to every toll office within the boat's trading range. At toll offices if a toll collector suspected an incorrect waybill (declared cargo) {{the height of the}} four corners of the boat were <b>checked</b> <b>with</b> a gauging stick and averaged to allow for uneven cargo loading. That boat's entry in the gauging table was used to determine the cargo weight. The toll fee was worked out from the weight and cargo type.|$|E
25|$|Jerry Atkins, Booker's band leader, had {{arranged}} with the girl's parents {{to take her}} to and from the dances, taking turns with bandmate Ernie Holcomb. It was Holcomb's turn that night, but he said Booker told him that she had a ride with an old friend. Atkins was awakened the next morning at 6:00 with a telephone call. It was a female asking if he knew where Booker was. He had no knowledge of Booker's change of plans and told the caller that Holcomb took her home, but he was informed she had been expected at a party but never came. Atkins received a similar call around 8:00 from another girl, and he asked if she had <b>checked</b> <b>with</b> Booker's parents. This girl told him that Booker had gone with a friend named Paul but neither had attended the party.|$|E

Newton's law of gravity was accepted because it accounted for the motion of planets and moons {{in the solar system}} with considerable accuracy. [...] As the precision of experimental measurements gradually improved, some discrepancies with Newton's predictions were observed, and these were accounted for in the general theory of relativity.

500|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, all six {{remaining}} Adam Air 737s were immediately grounded awaiting safety checks. Vice-President of Indonesia, Jusuf Kalla, said that all Boeing 737-300s should be checked. He eventually decided the entire Indonesian fleet of 737s should be checked, but did not ground any more aircraft. There were also suggestions that Adam Air should be suspended from all operations until the entire fleet could be <b>checked,</b> <b>with</b> MP Abdul Hakim saying [...] "It will be good for the company and the government ... until the flight authorities can determine if Adam Air is still worthy as national aircraft company".|$|E

The level of measured gamma radiation determined how long personnel could operate in them without exceeding the allowable daily dose. Instant gamma readings were taken by radiation safety specialists, but film-badge dosimeters, which could be read {{at the end of the}} day, were issued to all personnel believed to be at the greatest radiological risk. Anyone whose badge showed more than 0.1 R per day exposure was removed for one or more days from areas and activities of possible exposure. The maximum accumulated exposure recorded was 3.72R, received by a radiation safety specialist.|$|E
