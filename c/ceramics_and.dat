5|$|Although {{not much}} {{is known about}} Maya scribes, some did sign their work, both on <b>ceramics</b> <b>and</b> on stone sculpture.

5|$|Helium leaks through cracks {{should not}} be {{confused}} with gas permeation through a bulk material. While helium has documented permeation constants (thus a calculable permeation rate) through glasses, <b>ceramics,</b> <b>and</b> synthetic materials, inert gases such as helium will not permeate most bulk metals.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{bearings}} {{are both}} full ceramic bearings and ceramic hybrid bearings with balls in <b>ceramics</b> <b>and</b> races in steel.

5|$|In archaeological nomenclature, Norte Chico is a pre-ceramic {{culture of}} the pre-Columbian Late Archaic; it {{completely}} lacked <b>ceramics</b> <b>and</b> apparently had almost no visual art. The most impressive achievement of the civilization was its monumental architecture, including large earthwork platform mounds and sunken circular plazas. Archaeological evidence suggests use of textile technology and, possibly, the worship of common god symbols, both of which recur in pre-Columbian Andean cultures. Sophisticated government is assumed to have been required to manage the ancient Norte Chico. Questions remain over its organization, particularly the influence of food resources on politics.|$|E
5|$|Manganese {{compounds}} {{have been}} used as pigments and for the coloring of <b>ceramics</b> <b>and</b> glass. The brown color of ceramic is sometimes the result of manganese compounds. In the glass industry, manganese compounds are used for two effects. Manganese(III) reacts with iron(II) to induce a strong green color in glass by forming less-colored iron(III) and slightly pink manganese(II), compensating for the residual color of the iron(III). Larger quantities of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass.|$|E

5|$|The {{hills of}} Euonymeia, {{together}} with the adjacent coastal promontory of Agios Kosmas {{are the two most}} important sites of Neolithic and Aegean Bronze Age development in the area of Athens prior to ca. 3000 BCE. <b>Ceramics</b> <b>and</b> obsidian tools found on both sites were identified as originating from the island of Melos, indicating close ties of these settlements with the obsidian-rich islands of the cycladic civilization. The commonality of findings in Agios Kosmas and Euonymeia suggests that the two settlements were functionally linked coastal and inland communities.|$|E

5|$|After AD 700 {{the pyramid}} served an {{important}} funerary function. Three elite burials have been excavated from the pyramid, two males and a female, accompanied by extremely high quality funerary offerings. The offerings include polychrome <b>ceramics</b> <b>and</b> objects crafted from shell, conch {{and mother of}} pearl that are inscribed with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic imagery. These associated finds are of sufficient quality {{that it is possible}} that the deceased were members of the royal family. The burials have been dated to the reign of YaxNuunAyiinII, who ruled from AD 769 to 794. During the Terminal Classic some minor changes were made to the temple chambers and there may have been structural reinforcement of the front of the temple. Although it is poorly preserved, the inside of the temple rooms were inscribed with graffiti that is likely to date to this time.|$|E
5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of <b>ceramics</b> <b>and</b> cement.|$|E
5|$|Colin Renfrew {{has pointed}} out the dangers of {{applying}} modern values of art to past societies and cultures. Günter Berghaus argues that these works have often been approached {{with a set of}} post-Renaissance aesthetic values that distinguish between artists and craftsman and art and artifact, although these categories are not universal and may be inappropriate for understanding prehistoric society. Duncan Garrow has pointed to the difficulties of the modern distinction drawn between form and decoration. The emphasis in studies of prehistoric art tend to be placed on decoration in objects such as <b>ceramics</b> <b>and</b> ignores the importance of form, found in objects such as weapons.|$|E

5|$|Limited sources {{indicate}} for {{the early}} Middle Ages indicate {{that there was some}} trade of luxury goods with continental Europe. For most of the period there are not the detailed custom accounts that exist for England, that can provide an understanding of foreign trade, with the first records for Scotland dating to the 1320s. In the early Middle Ages, the rise of Christianity meant that wine and precious metals were imported for use in religious rites, and there are occasional references of trips to and from foreign countries, such as the incident recorded by Adomnán in which St Columba went to a port to await ships bearing news, and presumably other items, from Italy. Imported goods found in archaeological sites of the period include <b>ceramics</b> <b>and</b> glass, while many sites indicate iron and precious metal working.|$|E
5|$|Protohistoric {{refers to}} the period when American Indians were exposed to European trade items and large {{population}} shifts occurred because of introduced European diseases and warfare, but {{there is very little}} direct written documentation. Explorers such as Marquette and Joliet occasionally documented American Indians along the Mississippi in Iowa, {{but it was not until}} the early 19th century that regular written accounts of American Indians in Iowa became common. American Indians in the early Protohistoric period continued many aspects of Oneota culture, but soon almost all indigenous technology disappeared, including <b>ceramics</b> <b>and</b> stone tool production. It was during this period that the Meskwaki (Fox) and Sauk appeared in eastern Iowa, displaced from their homelands in the east. Important protohistoric sites include Milford; Blood Run; Gillett Grove; and Iowaville.|$|E
