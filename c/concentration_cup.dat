40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} seasonal variation, gas-particle partitioning, and particle-phase size distribution of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and current-use pesticides (CUPs) in air. Two years (2012 / 2013) of weekly air samples were collected at a background site in the Czech Republic using a high-volume air sampler. To study the particle-phase size distribution, air samples were also collected at an urban and rural site {{in the area of}} Brno, Czech Republic, using a cascade impactor separating atmospheric particulates according to six size fractions. Major differences were found in the atmospheric distribution of OCPs and <b>CUPs.</b> The atmospheric <b>concentrations</b> of <b>CUPs</b> were driven by agricultural activities while secondary sources such as volatilization from surfaces governed the atmospheric concentrations of OCPs. Moreover, clear differences were observed in gas-particle partitioning; CUP partitioning was influenced by adsorption onto mineral surfaces while OCPs were mainly partitioning to aerosols through absorption. A predictive method for estimating the gas-particle partitioning has been derived and is proposed for polar and non-polar pesticides. Finally, while OCPs and the majority of CUPs were largely found on fine particles, four CUPs (carbendazim, isoproturon, prochloraz, and terbuthylazine) had higher concentrations on coarse particles ([*]>[*]  3. 0  µm), which {{may be related to the}} pesticide application technique. This finding is particularly important and should be further investigated given that large particles result in lower risks from inhalation (regardless the toxicity of the pesticide) and lower potential for long-range atmospheric transport...|$|R
40|$|Quantifying {{nitrogen}} (N) losses {{below the}} root zone is highly challenging due to uncertainties associated with estimating drainage fluxes and solute {{concentrations in the}} leachate. Active and passive soil water samplers provide solute concentrations but give limited information on water fluxes. Mechanistic models are used to estimate leaching, but require calibration with measured data to ensure their reliability. Data from a drainage lysimeter trial under irrigation in which soil profile nitrate (NO 3 -) concentrations were monitored using wetting front detectors (passive sampler) and ceramic suction cups (active sampler) were compared to NO 3 - concentrations in draining and resident soil water as simulated by the research version of the Soil Water Balance model (SWB-Sci). SWB-Sci is a daily time-step, cascading soil water and solute balance model that provides draining NO 3 - concentrations by accounting for incomplete solute mixing. As hypothesized, suction <b>cup</b> <b>concentrations</b> aligned closely with resident soil water concentrations, while wetting front detector concentrations aligned closely with draining soil water NO 3 - concentrations. These results demonstrate the power of combining monitoring and modelling to estimate NO 3 - leaching losses.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation at the yeast CUP 1 gene was addressed. CUP 1 encodes a metallothionein required for cell growth at high copper <b>concentrations.</b> Induction of <b>CUP</b> 1 with copper resulted in targeted acetylation of both H 3 and H 4 at the CUP 1 promoter. Nucleosomes containing upstream activating sequences and sequences farther upstream were the targets for H 3 acetylation. Targeted acetylation of H 3 and H 4 required the transcriptional activator (Ace 1 p) and the TATA boxes, suggesting that targeted acetylation occurs when TATA-binding protein binds to the TATA box or {{at a later}} stage in initiation. We have shown previously that induction results in nucleosome repositioning over the entire CUP 1 gene, which requires Ace 1 p but not the TATA boxes. Therefore, the movement of nucleosomes occurring on CUP 1 induction is independent of targeted acetylation. Targeted acetylation of both H 3 and H 4 also required {{the product of the}} SPT 10 gene, which encodes a putative histone acetylase implicated in regulation at core promoters. Disruption of SPT 10 was lethal at high copper concentrations and correlated with slower induction and reduced maximum levels of CUP 1 mRNA. These observations constitute evidence for a novel mechanism of chromatin activation at CUP 1, with a major role for the TATA box...|$|R

The original model was extended with a new grass and clover model, which included the capability to simulate rhizodeposition and root growth. The new model predicted the observed annual carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) production satisfactorily. The simulated first year residual effects of a cut grass or grass-clover ley varied between 0 and 34, while the residual effect of a grazed grass or grass-clover ley varied between 71 and 150 fertilizer equivalents (kg N ha- 1).

The timing of 3 phosphoinositide (3 PI) <b>concentration</b> changes in <b>cup</b> membranes suggests a role for 3 PIs in deactivation of Cdc 42. This study examined the relationships between PI 3 K and the patterns of Rho-family GTPase signaling during phagosome formation. Inhibition of PI 3 K resulted in persistently active Cdc 42 and Rac 1, but not Rac 2, in stalled phagocytic cups. Patterns of 3 PIs and Rho-family GTPase activities during phagocytosis of 5 - and 2 -m-diameter microspheres indicated similar underlying mechanisms despite particle size– dependent sensitivities to PI 3 K inhibition. Expression of constitutively active Cdc 42 (G 12 V) increased 3 PI concentrations in plasma membranes and small phagosomes, indicating a role for Cdc 42 in PI 3 K activation. Cdc 42 (G 12 V) inhibited phagocytosis at a later stage than inhibition by dominant negative Cdc 42 (N 17). Together, these studies identified a Cdc 42 activation cycle organized by PI 3 K, in which FcR-activated Cdc 42 stimulates PI 3 K and actin polymerization, and the subsequent increase of 3 PIs in cup membranes inactivates Cdc 42 to allow actin recycling necessary for phagosome formation...|$|R
40|$|Much {{research}} {{has been focused on}} mass transfer phenomena in packed beds. For Peclet numbers above 200, empirical relations have been derived that predict the value of the mass transfer coefficient {{as a function of the}} Reynolds number and the Schmidt number. These relations are more or less similar to the well-known relation that Ranz and Marshall derived for mass transfer around a single sphere in an infinite medium Sh = ¿ + ßRe¿Sc¿ For packed beds of spherical particles an ¿-value of 3. 89 can be calculated on basis of fundamental considerations. However, Sherwood numbers much lower than this minimum value have been observed at Peclet numbers below 100. Several explanations have been proposed for this apparent discrepancy, such as misinterpretation of the experimental results due to unjustified neglection of axial dispersion or wall channeling. In this work, a model that predicts the combined effects of axial dispersion and wall channeling has been developed. With this model, it is possible to explain the results obtained with undiluted beds in which all particles are active in the process of mass transfer. However, such an explanation is not possible for the results obtained with diluted beds in which not all particles are active. Therefore, in the case of diluted beds other reasons for the apparent drop in mass transfer rate must exist. In the present investigation, it is demonstrated that the drop again originates from misinterpretation of the experimental results. It is shown, both experimentally and theoretically, that low Sherwood numbers can be obtained when large differences exist between the local concentration, experienced by an active particle and the mixed <b>cup</b> <b>concentration</b> of the whole bed cross-section...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTea {{from the}} plant Camellia sinensis is the world’s most popular non-alcoholic beverage, next to water. Tea {{can be divided into}} six types, and the most popular teas are black tea, green tea and oolong. In this study infusions of 85 Norwegian and Polish tea samples were {{analysed}} to investigate the content of trace elements. 40 samples from Norwegian supermarkets, 30 from the local tea and coffee shop and 15 Polish samples were infused for 5 minutes with ultrapure boiling water (1 gram tea/ 100 mL). The fluoride content in the tea infusions was determined using an ion selective electrode (ISE), {{and the rest of the}} elements were determined by high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HR ICP-MS). Tea is a rich source of essential elements as calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn). The infusions also contain non essential elements as nickel (Ni),lead (Pb), fluoride (F) and aluminium (Al). The average <b>concentrations</b> in one <b>cup</b> of tea from the Norwegian market contains among other elements average concentrations of 0. 6 mg Ca/L, 2. 8 mg P/L, 37. 1 mg K/L, 2. 0 mg Mg/L, 5. 9 µg Fe/L, 14. 1 µg Cu/L, 26. 4 µg Zn/L, 0. 6 mg Mn/L, 9. 9 µg Ni/L, 0. 16 µg Pb/L, 0. 5 µg Cr/L, 1. 0 mg F/L and 1. 1 mg Al/L. For the essential elements Ca, P, K, Mg, Fe, Cu and Zn the tea infusions will not contribute to attain the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) in any extent, but for Mn where the AI are 2. 3 mg/day (men) and 1. 8 mg/day (women) a few cups of tea can exceed the given AI level. The amount of Pb in the infusions is sustainable lower than the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of 25 µg/kg body weight. Drinking tea will therefore not contribute in any high extent to the PTWI. There were on the other hand obtained vast variations of F concentrations in different types of tea and tea contributes also in huge extent to AI of F - 3 mg/day (women), 4 mg/day (men) and from 0. 5 - 1 mg/day (0 - 12 year olds). One cup of tea could easily exceed the AI, at least considering children drinking tea. The Al content in tea is high, and for heavy tea drinkers may tea be the largest single source of Al to contribute to the total weekly intake (TWI) of 1 mg/ kg body weight/ week. The study showed higher concentrations of elements in tea infusions made of tea bags than infusions made of loose tea. Suggesting that the elements in the crushed leaves in tea bags are more extractable than in the loose tea leaves. One other explanation is that the tea bags contain older tea leaves with lower quality and therefore older leaves with higher concentrations of e. g. Al.

40|$|The {{leaching}} {{of nitrogen}} (N) and phosphorus (P) from the rootzone of cropping systems {{is a major}} contributor of non-point source pollution resulting in deterioration of fresh water supplies. An escalating world population is forcing further intensification of agricultural production practices and the identification of suitable and effective management practices to reduce N and P leaching losses is becoming ever more important. Such leaching losses are, however, extremely challenging to measure and quantify due to uncertainties associated with the estimation of deep drainage and N and P concentrations in this drainage water. SWB-Sci is a locally developed, mechanistic crop model to which N and P subroutines {{have been added to}} enable analysis of leaching losses at the local scale. This involved novel approaches to estimate the effects of N deficiencies on yield; to simulate crop P demand, uptake and stress effects; to simulate banded P fertilizer applications; and to estimate incomplete solute mixing. New equations to estimate the size of the Labile P pool from soil P tests commonly used in South Africa, and guidelines on the classification of South African soils as calcareous, slightly weathered or highly weathered which is required to simulate P, were also developed. The upgraded more versatile model was tested using historical datasets from the Netherlands, Kenya and South Africa, and performed well in simulating N and P dynamics in maize and wheat cropping systems. Variables tested included aboveground dry matter production, yield, leaf area index, aboveground crop N and P mass, grain N and P mass, soil water content ABSTRACT xvii and soil inorganic N levels. A study was also conducted on a large drainage lysimeter into which suction cups and wetting front detectors were installed, and data from this experiment together with the SWB-Sci model was used to study vertical solute movement more closely. As hypothesized, wetting front detector nitrate (NO 3 -) and P concentrations were observed to align closely with simulated mobile phase <b>concentrations,</b> and suction <b>cup</b> NO 3 - concentrations were observed to align closely with simulated immobile phase concentrations. These results confirm that monitoring and modelling can be used together to improve understanding and obtain more accurate estimates of N and P leaching losses, and further work on this approach is recommended {{for a wide range of}} soils and cropping systems. Finally, long-term modelling with the SWB-Sci model was used to analyse and compare N and P leaching losses from a dryland versus an irrigated monoculture maize production system. Over a 30 year simulation period, irrigated maize was estimated to leach considerably higher loads of N and P (~ 4 -fold higher). For dryland production, zero leaching was observed for consecutive years on several occasions, with major leaching losses associated with high rainfall events. A ‘room for rain’ irrigation scheduling management practice was estimated to reduce N leaching by 12 % and P leaching by 14 %, while a crop rotation system which incorporated wheat grown over the winter months was estimated to reduce N leaching by 23 % and P leaching by 24 %. From this study, long-term modelling was confirmed as an effective approach to investigate N and P leaching losses, to assist with the planning and design of field trials, and to assess the effectiveness of best management practices. It is envisaged that SWB-Sci will continue to evolve as a valuable tool for analysing and reducing N and P leaching losses from cropping systems to further reduce non-point source pollution.

In the late 1980 's, concerns were raised that higher P application rates than those calculated by the CFAS model were necessary to maintain Olsen P levels on Wharekohe podzols. The soil loss factor (SLF) was identified as the model parameter which most likely led to {{the inability of the}} CFAS model to predict P requirements on these podzols. The new Outlook model also uses a mass balance approach incorporating a soil P loss parameter to calculate pasture P requirements. In this study the apparent limitation of the CFAS model to predict the maintenance P requirements of the Wharekohe soils, and the appropriateness of the soil loss parameter used in the New Outlook model, was investigated by (a) determining the fate of applied fertiliser P, (b) examining the possible mechanisms for any soil P retention or loss, (c) quantifying the SLF and (d) modeling the fate of applied fertiliser P. A chronosequence study found that pasture development resulted in an increase in total soil P {{to the top of the}} E horizon with increased P movement down the profile with increasing pasture age. The Wharekohe silt loam appears to have a maximum P storage capacity which is reached by 8 years in the 0 - 3 cm depth (approx. 166 kg applied P/ha) and by 11 years in the 0 - 7. 5 cm depth (approx. 350 kg applied P/ha). The maximum total P storage capacity can mostly be attributed to a maximum inorganic P (Pi) storage capacity. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) extractable iron and aluminium-Pi was found to be limited in the Wharekohe soil, due to its low sesquioxide content, in comparison to other New Zealand soils. Once the P storage capacity at each depth is reached there is little further accumulation of applied P and much of the P applied in subsequent application is lost from the topsoil in runoff waters. Up to 65 % of the applied P could not be accounted for by animal loss or accumulation in the top 7. 5 cm of older sites (> 30 years). A glass house leaching study using intact soil cores confirmed that substantial quantities of applied P can be transported in subsurface water movement through Wharekohe podzols. Forty times more P moved through the Wharekohe soil cores than through cores of the yellow brown earth, Aponga clay (≤ 45. 6 µg/ml in contrast to ≤ 1. 07 µg P/ml). In a field study using suction <b>cups,</b> <b>concentrations</b> of up to 18. 65 µg P/ml were obtained in soil water sampled under fertilised Wharekohe silt loam plots in comparison to 30 years) where the Outlook model is used to calculate P requirements (36 kg P/ha lost in runoff from a calculated P requirement of 44 kg P/ha) compared to the CFAS model (13 kg P/ha lost in runoff from a calculated P requirement of 21 kg P/ha), due to the higher soil loss parameter assigned to the Wharekohe soils in the Outlook model. Such high runoff P losses represent a cost to New Zealand both economically, and environmentally through increased P inputs to water ways leading to possible eutrophication. When runoff P losses have been quantified, through further research, they could be used in the PRIHLS model to predict P requirements and would enable more informed decisions to be made about balanced P fertiliser use on Wharekohe podzols...|$|R
