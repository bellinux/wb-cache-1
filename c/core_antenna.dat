40|$|Photosynthetic organisms have various {{pigments}} {{enabling them}} to adapt to various light environments. Green plants are divided into two groups: streptophytes and chlorophytes. Streptophytes include some freshwater green algae and land plants, while chlorophytes comprise the other freshwater green algae and seawater green algae. The environmental conditions driving the divergence of green plants into these two groups and the changes in photosynthetic properties accompanying their evolution remain unknown. Here, we separated the <b>core</b> <b>antennae</b> of PSI and the peripheral antennae [light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) ] in green plants by green-native gel electrophoresis and determined their pigment compositions. Freshwater green algae and land plants have high Chl a/b ratios, with most Chl b existing in LHCs. In contrast, seawater green algae have low Chl a/b ratios. In addition, Chl b exists not only in LHCs but also in PSI <b>core</b> <b>antennae</b> in these organisms, a situation beneficial for survival in deep seawater, where blue-green light is the dominant light source. Finally, low-energy Chl (red Chl) of PSI was detected in freshwater green algae and land plants, but not in seawater green algae. We thus conclude that the different level of Chl b accumulation in <b>core</b> <b>antennae</b> and differences in PSI red Chl between freshwater and seawater green algae are evolutionary adaptations of these algae to their habitats, especially to high-or low-light environments...|$|R

40|$|Chlorophyll b {{is found}} in {{photosynthetic}} prokaryotes and primary and secondary endosymbionts, although their light-harvesting systems are quite different. Chlorophyll b is synthesized from chlorophyll a by chlorophyllide a oxygenase (CAO), which is a Rieske-mononuclear iron oxygenase. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of CAO among photosynthetic organisms elucidated changes in the domain structures of CAO during evolution. However, the evolutionary relationship between the light-harvesting system and the domain structure of CAO remains unclear. To elucidate this relationship, we investigated the CAO structure and the pigment composition of chlorophyll-protein complexes in the prasinophyte Micromonas. The Micromonas CAO is composed of two genes, MpCAO 1 and MpCAO 2, that possess Rieske and mononuclear iron-binding motifs, respectively. Only when both genes were introduced into the chlorophyll b-less Arabidopsis mutant (ch 1 - 1) was chlorophyll b accumulated, indicating that cooperation between the two subunits is required to synthesize chlorophyll b. Although Micromonas has a characteristic light-harvesting system in which chlorophyll b is incorporated into the <b>core</b> <b>antennas</b> of reaction centers, chlorophyll b was also incorporated into the <b>core</b> <b>antennas</b> of reaction centers of the Arabidopsis transformants that contained the two Micromonas CAO proteins.

50|$|In more {{sophisticated}} crystal receivers, the tuning coil is replaced with an adjustable air <b>core</b> <b>antenna</b> coupling transformer which improves the selectivity by {{a technique called}} loose coupling. This consists of two magnetically coupled coils of wire, one (the primary) attached to the antenna and ground and the other (the secondary) attached {{to the rest of}} the circuit. The current from the antenna creates an alternating magnetic field in the primary coil, which induced a current in the secondary coil which was then rectified and powered the earphone. Each of the coils functions as a tuned circuit; the primary coil resonated with the capacitance of the antenna (or sometimes another capacitor), and the secondary coil resonated with the tuning capacitor. Both the primary and secondary were tuned to the frequency of the station. The two circuits interacted to form a resonant transformer.|$|E
50|$|While any radio {{covering}} the mediumwave (AM radio) band {{can be used}} for DX purposes, serious DXers generally invest in a higher-quality receiver, and often a specialised indoor tuned box loop or outdoor longwire antenna. At {{the lower end of the}} spectrum, a portable radio with a larger-than-normal internal ferrite <b>core</b> <b>antenna</b> designed for long-distance AM radio reception may be used, such as the discontinued GE Superadio, CC Radio, or the Panasonic RF-2200. The Sony ICF-7600G (not the newer GR) model is also excellent for budget minded MW dxing. More serious DXers may spend much more for a tabletop shortwave communications receiver with good performance on the lower mediumwave frequencies using an external antenna, such as the AOR 7030+, Drake R8/R8A/R8B, Icom R-75, or Palstar R-30. Various models by Hallicrafters, Hammarlund and even home-made models from Heathkit have been popular. In recent years, software defined radios have become more popular for mediumwave DX. Radios like the Microtelecom Perseus and the Elad FDM-S2 can record the entire mediumwave band to a computer hard drive, which can then be played back and tuned later. With any such receiver, a high-performance loop antenna may be employed, or in the alternative, one or more outdoor longwire Beverage antennas, sometimes many hundreds of meters long. In order to cancel out reception of unwanted stations, some DX listeners employ elaborate phased arrays of multiple Beverage antennas. For trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific reception, where the target station is on a 9 kHz rather than a 10 kHz multiple or vice versa, receivers with narrow RF filters are useful in rejecting adjacent broadcasts on the listener's own continent. To combat noise, DXers may use an outboard noise attenuation device, or a radio with built-in digital signal processing capabilities. A personal computer with specialized logging software or simply a paper notebook is used to write logs. Recording devices can be used to archive memorable DX moments, or identify hard-to-hear station receptions after the fact.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Phototrophy, the {{conversion}} of light to biochemical energy, occurs throughout the Bacteria and plants, however, debate continues over how dif-ferent phototrophic mechanisms and the bacteria that contain them are related. There {{are two types of}} phototrophic mechanisms in the Bacteria: reaction center type 1 (RC 1) has core and <b>core</b> <b>antenna</b> do-mains that are parts of a single polypeptide, whereas reaction center type 2 (RC 2) is composed of short core proteins without antenna domains. In cyano-bacteria, RC 2 is associated with separate core an-tenna proteins that are homologous to the <b>core</b> <b>antenna</b> domains of RC 1. We reconstructed evolu-tionary relationships among phototrophic mecha-nisms based on a phylogeny of <b>core</b> <b>antenna</b> domains/proteins. <b>Core</b> <b>antenna</b> domains of 46 polypeptides were aligned, including the RC 1 core proteins of heliobacteria, green sulfur bacteria, and photosystem I (PSI) of cyanobacteria and plastids, plus <b>core</b> <b>antenna</b> proteins of photosystem II (PSII) from cyanobacteria and plastids. Maximum likeli-hood, parsimony, and neighbor joining methods all supported a single phylogeny in which PSII <b>core</b> <b>antenna</b> proteins (PsbC, PsbB) arose within the cy-anobacteria from duplications of the RC 1 -associated <b>core</b> <b>antenna</b> domains and accessory antenna pro-teins (IsiA, PcbA, PcbC) arose from duplications of PsbB. The data indicate an evolutionary history of RC 1 in which an initially homodimeric reaction center was vertically transmitted to green sulfur bacteria, heliobacteria, and an ancestor of cyano-bacteria. A heterodimeric RC 1 (=PSI) then arose within the cyanobacterial lineage. In this scenario, the current diversity of <b>core</b> <b>antenna</b> domains/proteins is explained without a need to invoke horizontal transfer...|$|E

Excitations in the PS I <b>core</b> <b>antenna</b> decay with lifetimes of 15 - 40 ps and 5 - 6 ns. The fast decay results from efficient photochemical quenching by P 700, whereas the slow decay {{is attributed to}} <b>core</b> <b>antenna</b> complexes lacking a trap. Samples containing core and peripheral antenna complexes exhibited an additional intermediate lifetime (150 - 350 ps) decay.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the photophysics of energy migration and trapping in photosystem I by investigating the spectral and temporal properties of the fluorescence from the <b>core</b> <b>antenna</b> chlorophylls {{as a function of}} the antenna size. Time-correlated single photon counting was used to determine the fluorescence lifetimes in the isolated P 700 chlorophyll a-protein complex and in a mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that lacks the photosystem II reaction center complex. The fluorescence decay in both types of sample is dominated by a fast (15 - 45 psec) component that is attributed to the lifetime of excitations in the photosystem I <b>core</b> <b>antenna.</b> These excitations decay primarily by an efficient photochemical quenching on P 700. The measured lifetimes show a linear relationship to the <b>core</b> <b>antenna</b> size. A linear dependence of the excitation lifetime on antenna size was predicted previously in a lattice model for excitation migration and trapping in arrays of photosynthetic pigments [Pearlstein, R.

Based on this model, our data predict a time constant for photochemical charge separation in the photosystem I reaction center of 2. 8 +/- 0. 7 or 3. 4 +/- 0. 7 psec, assuming monomeric or dimeric P 700, respectively. The predicted average single-step transfer time for excitation transfer between <b>core</b> <b>antenna</b> pigments is 0. 21 +/- 0. 04 psec.

Processes with similar lifetimes and spectra are observed in both the membrane fragments and the detergent-isolated particles, suggesting little disruption of the <b>core</b> <b>antenna</b> resulting from the detergent treatment. For the detergent-isolated particles, three different excitation wavelengths were used to excite different distributions of pigments in the spectrally heterogeneous <b>core</b> <b>antenna.</b> Only two lifetimes of 2. 7 - 4. 3 ps and 24 - 28 ps, and a nondecaying component are required to describe all the data. The 24 - 28 ps component is associated with trapping. The trapping process gives rise to a nondecaying spectrum that is due to oxidation of the primary electron donor. The lifetimes and spectra associated with trapping and radical pair formation are independent of excitation wavelength, suggesting that trapping proceeds from an equilibrated excited state. The 2. 7 - 4. 3 ps component characterizes the evolution from the initially excited distribution of pigments to the equilibrated excited state distribution. The spectrum associated with the 2. 7 - 4. 3 ps component is therefore strongly excitation wavelength dependent.

The temperature dependence of the absorption and emission spectra of the individual Chl molecules in the protein matrix is calculated based on a model Hamiltonian which includes a phonon contribution. Time and wavelength resolved kinetics of PSI at different temperatures are investigated by means of two-dimensional lattice models. We conclude that wavelength-dependent fluorescence decay kinetics result only when two or more bottlenecks exist in the energy transfer and trapping process. A single trap or several pseudo-traps with spectrally identical environments do not lead to wavelength dependent decays. Simple funnel arrangements of the spectral types can be ruled out.

The near-infrared (NIR) CD signal of these <b>core</b> <b>antennae</b> is strongly nonconservative, {{and the nature of}} this nonconservativity is under examination in this paper. So far, {{on the basis of the}} high-resolution structures of LH 2, we have been able to model the absorption and CD spectra in the bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) Q(Y) and Q(X) regions of LH 2 (Georgakopoulou et al., Biophys.

We proceed by applying the same modeling method in order to reproduce the LH 1 spectra. We assume a ring of dimers in a perfect circular arrangement with 16 -fold symmetry, and account for all excitonic interactions within the ring. Because LH 1 complexes exhibit Q(Y) and Q(X) CD signals of very low intensity, higher transitions can easily affect these regions. Therefore, we expand the model and take into account also the Soret and carotenoid transitions. We can now understand the shape of the absorption and CD spectra and contemplate the structure of the LH 1 complex. The latter is similar to LH 2 in that it is a very symmetric ring dominated by excitonic interactions. The larger number of symmetry and the bigger diameter of LH 1, combined with small rotations of the BChl transition dipole moments, are responsible for the display of CD signals that are very low in intensity. The interaction of the Q(Y) with the carotenoid transitions results in complete loss of the conservativity. Interaction energies between all the pigments in the ring are calculated, and their values are in good accordance with what is reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Light-harvesting <b>antenna</b> <b>core</b> (LH 1 -RC) {{complexes}} {{isolated from}} Rhodospirillum rubrum and Rhodopseudomonas palustris were successfully self-assembled on an ITO electrode modified with 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane. Near infra-red (NIR) absorption, fluorescence, and IR spectra of these LH 1 -RC complexes indicated that these LH 1 -RC complexes on the electrode were stable on the electrode. An efficient energy transfer and photocurrent responses of these LH 1 -RC complexes on the electrode were observed upon illumination of the LH 1 complex at 880  nm...|$|R
50|$|Ferrite rod aerials (or antennae) are a type {{of small}} {{magnetic}} loop (SML) antenna very common in AM radio broadcast band transistor radios, although they began {{to be used in}} vacuum tube ("valve") radios in the 1950s. They are also useful in very low frequency (VLF) receivers, and can sometimes give good results over most of the shortwave frequencies assuming a suitable ferrite is used). They consist of a coil of wire wound around a ferrite rod core (usually several inches longer than the coil, but sometimes over 3 feet long). This core effectively ‘concentrates’ the magnetic field of the radio waves to give a stronger signal than could be obtained by an air <b>core</b> loop <b>antenna</b> of comparable size, although still not as strong as the signal that could be obtained with a good outdoor wire aerial.|$|R
