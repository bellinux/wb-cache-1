40|$|Abstract—Conical spiral antennas {{can have}} an input {{impedance}} and gain that are nearly frequency independent over a wide bandwidth. However, these antennas normally have dispersive properties that produce significant distortion when {{they are used to}} radiate a pulse. In this paper, we examine this dispersion in detail and the possibility of compensating for the dispersion so that the antenna can be used for pulse radiation. First, a simple, qualitative model for this antenna is described. This model provides physical insight into the causes for the dispersion. Next, the antenna is examined using an accurate, full electromagnetic analysis done with the finite-difference time-domain method. Results from this analysis support the conclusions reached with the simple model and provide additional insight into the dispersion. Finally, an approach for compensating for the dispersion in the antenna is described, and the interesting features of the pulse radiated from this antenna, after compensation, are discussed.

Ideally, the antennas used in these applications should be frequency-independent to avoid signal distortion. Examples of practical, frequency independent antennas are the planar and conical spirals.

40|$|It is {{indispensable}} {{to know the}} dielectric constant of model sea ice in order to detect the ice thickness by radar. The authors measured the dielectric constsnt of model sea ice by the space reflection method using UHF waves. A UHF signal is swept from 200 MHz to 1000 MHz and is transmitted from an antenna toward the model sea ice set on a metal sheet. The transmitting antenna is a <b>conical</b> log <b>spiral</b> <b>antenna</b> for a right circular polarized wave. The receiving antenna is an inverse type antenna so the reflected signal is inverted to a left circular polarized wave when the signal is reflected from the ice surface. The amplitude and phase of the received signal are measured by a vector network analyzer and are referred to the reflection data of the metal sheet which is set at 1 m distance from the antennae. The dielectric constant of model ice is calculated from {{the relation between the}} ice thikness and the signal phase change in the ice. The results are summarized as follows. Though the calculated dielectric constant of model sea ice is the mean value of the total ice sheet, the measurement procedure is simple and the resolution of the data is enough for practical use...|$|R

We present statistics of tropospheric ducting events observed in the digital TV band over nearly two years, which shows seasonal changes.

The design of antenna system of the radio {{telescope is}} a critical issue because of the demand of wide bandwidth, high gain, directional beam, and circular polarization. Metsähovi radio observatory has proposed a project named Metsähovi compact array to build four radio telescopes {{in order to create}} new research platform in different areas, such as radio astronomy, solar research, and space physics. In this master thesis work, a wide band feed for the reflector antenna of the proposed radio telescope is analyzed and designed. Initially several solutions are studied and analyzed. Based on these studies, a two arm <b>conical</b> log <b>spiral</b> <b>antenna</b> (CLSA) is designed and constructed in CST. At first, a theoretical model of CLSA is developed. Further, the design equations are reformulated to simulate the model in CST. The simulation results shows good agreement with the theoretical model. Moreover, the antenna is also simulated with the bifilar lines to have an practical feeding system of the antenna. In this case the results shows poor performance due to the significant radiation coming out from the bifilar lines which is overlapping with the antenna radiation. To avoid this radiation, a hollow metal is introduced which covers the bifilar lines to block the radiation coming out from the bifilar lines. The antenna performance with bifilar lines satisfies most of the requirements that has set up for this work. Besides, a mechanical construction of the antenna is presented to protect the antenna from the outside environment...|$|R
