After the Second World War, Britain had limited resources, perhaps {{insufficient}} {{to the task of}} keeping order. Another viewpoint is that while Mountbatten may have been too hasty he had no real options left and achieved the best he could under difficult circumstances. The historian Lawrence James concurs that in 1947 Mountbatten was left with no option but to <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>run.</b> The alternative seemed to be involvement in a potentially bloody civil war from which {{it would be difficult to}} get out.|$|E
25|$|Yesterday I {{stood at}} Arlington National Cemetery {{attending}} {{the funeral of}} a young Marine in my district. He believed in {{what we were doing}} is the right thing and had the courage to lay his life on the line to do it. A few minutes ago I received a call from Colonel Danny Bubp, Ohio Representative from the 88th district in the House of Representatives. He asked me to send Congress a message: Stay the course. He also asked me to send Congressman Murtha a message, that cowards <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>run,</b> Marines never do. Danny and the rest of America and the world want the assurance from this body—that we will see this through.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{argue that}} the British were forced to {{expedite}} the Partition by events on the ground. Once in office, Mountbatten quickly became aware if Britain were to avoid involvement in a civil war, which seemed increasingly likely, there was no alternative to partition and a hasty exit from India.

25|$|UNAMSIL was {{eventually}} formed and deployed in 1999, authorised under a Chapter VII mandate, {{it was meant}} to enforce the Lome agreements. However, violence would continue. From the outset the RUF was beyond uncooperative and once the ECOMOG contingent withdrew, the RUF attacked UN forces, eventually taking hundreds hostage. This led to an unexpected backlash from the international community that the RUF did not anticipate. Its leadership had expected the international community to <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>run,</b> as it had done in Somalia and earlier when UNOMSIL fled Freetown. Instead, with British support, an aggressive campaign was waged against the RUF. UNAMSIL's mandate was expanded and its manpower enlarged. By late 2000 and early 2001 the RUF's military strength had been severely depleted. Thus the Abuja agreements were signed and UNAMSIL fulfilled its mandate in December 2005. While Sierra Leone is at peace today and the UN's mission can be deemed a success, {{the way in which the}} situation developed illustrates Shearer's point: that a consent-based approach focused on negotiation that encompasses all belligerents' interest may not necessarily lead to success. As we see, fighting continued despite the presence of UNOMSIL. Indeed, even after UNOMSIL was replaced by a more robust force under a Chapter VII mandate in the form of UNAMSIL the violence continued. It was not until the British intervened militarily and substantially degraded the RUF's capability to sustain the conflict, as Executive Outcomes had done years prior, did the RUF finally come to the negotiating table and allow for the establishment of peace.|$|E
500|$|On October 27, 2003, Cher {{anonymously}} {{called a}} C-SPAN phone-in program to recount a visit she made to maimed soldiers at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and criticized {{the lack of}} media coverage and government attention given to injured servicemen. She remarked that she watches C-SPAN every day. Although she identified herself as an unnamed entertainer, she was recognized by the C-SPAN host, who subsequently questioned her about her 1992 support for independent presidential candidate Ross Perot. She said, [...] "When I heard him talk right in the beginning, I thought that he would bring some sort of common-sense business approach and also less partisanship, but then... I was completely disappointed like everyone else when he just kind of <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>run</b> {{and no one knew}} exactly why... Maybe he couldn't have withstood all the investigation that goes on now".|$|E
500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>run.</b> And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, {{prove to me that}} you are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E

2500|$|Schmidt's remarks {{threw the}} House into an uproar and earned her the sobriquet [...] "Mean Jean". Many Democrats {{saw it as}} an unwarranted attack against Murtha, a 38-year Marine Corps veteran. After she said [...] "cowards <b>cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>run,</b> Marines never do," [...] angry Democrats nearly drowned out her words. Victor F. Snyder, a former Marine, of Arkansas demanded that Schmidt's remarks be [...] "taken down." [...] Under this {{disciplinary}} procedure, the House clerk would have re-read Schmidt's words and the presiding officer (at the time, Michael K. Simpson of Idaho) would have ruled whether they were parliamentary. [...] Had they been ruled unparliamentary, Schmidt {{would not have been}} able to speak for the rest of the day without permission.|$|E

50|$|Part Two {{begins with}} the {{battalion}} dug in very thinly along the Ruza, trying to cover a sector 8 km wide. Other sectors are coming under attack from German tanks. Panfilov visits for an hour, and persuades Momysh-Uly to send two platoons into no-man's-land to set up ambush positions along the two roads leading to his sector, and describes how they should fall {{back to the main}} position.
