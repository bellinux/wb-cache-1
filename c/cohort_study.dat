5|$|In Europe, a <b>cohort</b> <b>study</b> of 467,450 Danish {{children}} {{found no}} association between TCVs and autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), nor any dose-response relationship between thiomersal and ASDs {{that would be}} suggestive of toxic exposure.

A retrospective <b>cohort</b> <b>study</b> on 109,863 children in the United Kingdom found no association between TCVs and autism, but a possible increased risk for tics. Analysis in this study also showed a possible protective effect with respect to general developmental disorders, attention-deficit disorder, and otherwise unspecified developmental delay. Another UK study based on a prospective cohort of 13,617 children likewise found more associated benefits than risks from thiomersal exposure with respect to developmental disorders.

However, randomization nearly always has dramatic consequences for LTP research: The control conditions that are most informative (no treatment, wait list, placebo) are so unacceptable for the patients that decisive RCTs are, in most cases, unfeasible, but more feasible RCTs are less decisive. In contrast, the decisive power of <b>cohort</b> <b>studies</b> is determined by their methodological quality and knowledge of the natural course of the investigated disorders. <b>Cohort</b> <b>studies</b> are as capable as RCTs of meeting all quality criteria for intervention research, except for randomization. The knowledge of the natural course of the disorders suitable for LTP treatment is limited but not nonexistent. In most cases of LTP research, decisive RCTs present insurmountable, method-inherent feasibility problems and represent not the highest but rather an irrelevant level of evidence.
