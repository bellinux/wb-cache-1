40|$|Abstract: In the {{automotive}} industry <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> {{have been used to}} evaluate vehicles in different perspectives. If a vehicle manufacturer focuses only on a fixed <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> there is a risk that controllers of the vehicle are optimized for a certain <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> and hence are sub-optimal solutions to real-world driving. To deal with this issue, it is beneficial to have a method for generating more <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> that in some sense are equivalent but not identical. The idea here is that these generated <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> have the same vehicle excitation in the mean tractive force, MTF. Using the individual force components of the MTF in the generation of <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> with Markov chains makes it possible to generate equivalent <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> that have the same vehicle excitation from real-world driving data. This is motivated since the fuel consumption estimation is more accurate when the MTF components are considered. The result is a new method that combines the generation of <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> using real-world <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> with the concept of equivalent <b>driving</b> <b>cycles,</b> and the results are promising...|$|R

It is widely used of application for vehicle manufacturers, environmentalists and traffic engineers. The purposes of this study are; to analyse the real world driving pattern and to develop a <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> for small and medium duty engines in Ipoh, Malaysia. This study carried out a survey to describe the motorcycle and car <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> on the selected three routes in the peak hour periods of the traffic condition, which are morning, afternoon and evening peak periods. The study used a GPS equipment to record vehicle travel speeds (second by second). The driving characteristics were analysed from speed time data and its target statistic parameters were defined. The method for generating the <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> has been described. The analysis results show that there are significant difference of driving characteristic and <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> between motorcycle and car for Ipoh city. The characteristic of the developed <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> for car was compared with three well established worldwide <b>driving</b> <b>cycles.</b> This information gives a clear message that those <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> such as ECE <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> (for instance) is not suitable to predict the emission standard in Ipoh.

In the process, the important role is played by <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> that are the basis for emission estimations and measurements. For more detailed specification of emission values in cities a <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> representative for a particular region needs to be designed. In the graduation thesis, the <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> for Ljubljana’s urban environment was designed. It should reflect actual driving patterns to estimate exhaust emissions and fuel consumption. At the beginning, the theoretical bases of <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> are presented {{as well as the}} overview of known <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> in the world. They are followed by the description of collecting measurement data, the analysis of driving characteristics in urban environment and also the description of <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> methods development. The practical method of designing a representative cycle was used. It includes collecting data on driving patterns, statistical data procession and the development of <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> mechanism design. Collecting data on speed, position and other driving parameters was obtained by taking measurements in a vehicle. The data were statistically processed. By this target parameters were obtained that reflect the scale of representativeness of the new <b>driving</b> <b>cycle.</b> The <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> was created using micro-trip method where micro-trip is defined as the travelling between two consecutive time points when a vehicle stops. In this way the Ljubljana urban <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> was designed that takes 1587 s at approximate travelling speed of 22. 5 km/h at the length of 10. 19 km.

40|$|Driving cycles are {{important}} components for evaluation {{and design of}} vehicles. They determine the focus of vehicle manufacturers, and indirectly they affect {{the environmental impact of}} vehicles since the vehicle control system is usually tuned to one or several <b>driving</b> <b>cycles.</b> Thus, the <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> affects the design of the vehicle since cost, fuel consumption, and emissions all depend on the <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> used for design. Since the existing standard <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> cannot keep up with the changing road infrastructure, the changing vehicle fleet composition, and the growing number of vehicles on the road, which do all cause changes in the driver behavior, the need to get new and representative <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> are increasing. A research question is how to generate these new <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> so that they are both representative {{and at the same time}} have certain equivalence properties, to make fair comparisons of the performance results. Besides generation, another possibility to get more <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> is to transform the existing ones into new, different, <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> considering equivalence constraints. With the development of new powertrain concepts the need for evaluation will increase, and an interesting question is how to utilize new developments in dynamometer technology together with new possibilities for connecting equipment. Here a pedal robot is developed to be used in a vehicle mounted in a chassis dynamometer and the setup is used for co-simulation together with a moving base simulator that is connected with a communication line. The results show that the co-simulation can become a realistic driving experience and a viable option for dangerous tests and a complement to tests on a dedicated track or on-road tests, if improvements on the braking and the vehicle feedback to the driver are implemented. The problem of generating representative <b>driving</b> <b>cycles,</b> with specified excitation at the wheels, is approached with a combined two-step method. AMarkov chain approach is used to generate candidate <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> that are then transformed to equivalent <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> with respect to the mean tractive force components, which are the used measures. Using an optimization methodology the transformation of <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> is formulated as a nonlinear program with constraints and a cost function to minimize. The nonlinear program formulation can handle a wide range of constraints, e. g., the mean tractive force components, different power measures, or available energy for recuperation, and using the vehicle jerk as cost function gives good drivability. In conclusion, methods for <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> design have been proposed where new <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> can either be generated from databases, or given <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> can be transformed to fulfill certain equivalence constraints, approaching the important problem of similar but not the same.

To enable and facilitate this development, short, yet realistic, <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> need to be synthesized.

40|$|Future <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> {{generation}} A <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> is a {{speed profile}} (speed vs time) {{that can be}} used for comparison of exhaust emissions and fuel consumption of light-duty vehicles. For example in Europe, the <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> for certification of light-duty vehicles is the New European Driving <b>Cycle</b> (NEDC). A <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> needs to represent the average driving pattern in the region of interest so that it is possible to draw good conclusions of the results.
