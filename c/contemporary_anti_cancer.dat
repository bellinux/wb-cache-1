After the discovery of paclitaxel’s unique mechanism of action as a microtubule stabilizer, intense research followed, which despite drawbacks such as supply problems and low water solubility, resulted in the successful <b>anti</b> <b>cancer</b> medicine Taxol. At present, Taxol is used in the treatment of ovarian, breast and non-small cell lung cancer.

40|$|Introduction: Cyclophosphamide {{is used as}} an <b>anti</b> <b>cancer</b> {{medicine}} in chemotherapy.

Ginger includes many compounds, {{some of which are}} shogaols, gingerols, pyrogallols and sesquiterpenes. Ginger has <b>anti</b> nauseating, <b>anti</b> <b>cancer,</b> <b>anti</b> oxidant effects and eliminates free radicals. This medicine is used along with cyclophosphamide to reduce its destructive side effects in the body. Methods: For 21 days, the rats were fed with ginger and cyclophosphamide. After 21 days, the animals were weighed and rendered unconscious. Their testes were removed and tissue samples were provided from their testes. Results: The results showed that cyclophosphamide alone reduces body weight, testes weight and spermatogenesis as compared to the control group. In other experimental groups that were fed with ginger and cyclophosphamide, increased dosage of ginger increased the body weight, the testes weight and spermatogenesis in comparison to the other experimental groups. Conclusion: It seems that compounds present in ginger are anti tumoral and control the production of active metabolites.
