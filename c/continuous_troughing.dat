5|$|There are 5 premaxillary {{teeth in}} both species, {{the fourth of}} {{which is about a}} third larger {{relative}} to the others. The maxilla has 12 distinct sockets in K. langenbergensis. Excluding the pseudocaniniforms, the maxillary tooth size remains roughly constant but gradually decreases after the pseudocaniniforms in both species; all tooth sockets after the twelfth are replaced by a <b>continuous</b> <b>trough.</b> In total, K. guimarotae had at least 15 maxillary teeth, and K. langenbergensis 17 or 18. Meanwhile, the dentary exhibits 21 teeth in K. langenbergensis and at least 20 in K. guimarotae. Like the maxilla, distinct sockets for dentary teeth are replaced by a groove from the eleventh tooth backwards in K. langenbergensis.|$|R
40|$|The {{vibratory}} conveyor, routinely {{employed for}} normal-gravity transport of granular materials, usually {{consists of a}} <b>continuous</b> open <b>trough</b> vibrated sinusoidally to induce axial movement of a granular material. Motivated {{in part by a}} hypothetical application in zero gravity, we propose a novel modification of the vibratory conveyor based on a closed 2 d trough operating in a "slide-conveying" mode, with the granular mass remaining permanently in contact with the trough walls. We present a detailed analysis of the mechanics of transport, based on a rigid-slab model for the granular mass with frictional (Coulomb) slip at the upper and lower walls. The form of the vibration cycle plays a crucial role, and the optimal conveying cycle is not the commonly assumed rectilinear sinusoidal motion. The conveying efficiency for the novel slide conveyor will be presented for several simple vibration cycles, including one believed to represent the theoretical optimum...|$|R
50|$|In {{the middle}} of May 1943, prior to the formal {{commencement}} of Case Black and in its initial phases, around 2,000 men from Lim-Sandžak Chetnik Detachment (LSCD), including Đurišić, were captured by German forces. During {{next couple of weeks}} the Italians disarmed majority of Chetniks in Montenegro, captured and interned to prison in Italy big number of Chetnik commanders, including many from the staff of LSCD. Initially, Đorđije Lašić gathered scattered groups of Chetniks on the territory that was under Djurisić's control. Lašić and Djurisic were in conflict earlier and Djurišić's former associates did not trust him. With the approval of Perhinek, they recreated Chetnik organisation and new staff of LSCD and proposed Mihailović to appoint Lukačević as their commander. Mihailović accepted this proposal and Vojislav Lukačević succeeded Đurišić as the commander of the remaining men of the detachment and, accompanied by Perhinek, came to Berane on 14 July 1943. Perhinek and Mihailović maintained <b>continuous</b> communication <b>trough</b> radiotelegraphy.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} test the effectiveness of design modifications terms of efficiency and power production in an existing parabolic solar concentrator. The proposed modifications included {{limiting the number of}} parabolic ribs to be constructed to two, using struts of slotted angle iron to approximate a <b>continuous</b> parabolic <b>trough,</b> and increasing the thickness of the mirrored sheet metal to be formed to 0. 035 ". A quarter-scale model of the system was constructed using materials and tools indigenous to Lesotho. The apparatus was tested for its ability to raise the temperature of a known amount of water in a specified amount of time. Results show that the system was capable of creating steam; however, the water in the system only reached an internal temperature of 81 ⁰C as opposed to the theoretical value of 467. 01 ⁰C, which yields an error of 82. 7 %. by Toni Ferreira.

40|$|Data {{on water}} sources, mode of offer, {{watering}} frequency, {{amount of water}} offered, body weights and milk yield were collected from 21 randomly selected smallholder farms in Kiambu by means of farm visits and questionnaires fortnightly. Most farms (67 %) had water on-farm but 76 % of them needed labour to deliver the water to the animals. Fifty {{two percent of the}} farms practised <b>continuous</b> watering. Water <b>troughs</b> (67 %) were mostly used to water dairy cattle. Farms with on-farm water offered dairy cows more (134 ml/kg live wt) water compared to those collecting (76 ml/kg live wt) or purchasing (81 ml/kg live wt) water. Preliminary results on milk yield using descriptive statistics show that dairy cows with on-farm water produce less milk (6. 4 l/day) compared with 8. 0 l/day and 9. 0 l/day for those collecting or purchasing water respectively. Dairy cows using water troughs produced less milk (6. 34 l/day) than those using bowls or buckets (8. 44 l/day) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in ICU patients and to examine whether contemporary antibiotic dosing results in concentrations that have been associated with favourable response. Methods: The Defining Antibiotic Levels in Intensive Care (DALI) study was a prospective, multicentre pharmacokinetic point-prevalence study. Antibiotic dosing was as per the treating clinician either by intermittent bolus or <b>continuous</b> infusion. Target <b>trough</b> concentration was defined as >= 15 mg/L and target pharmacodynamic index was defined as an area under the concentration-time curve over a 24 -hour period divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration of the suspected bacteria (AUC(0 - 24) /MIC ratio) > 400 (assuming MIC 400 (odds ratio (OR) 1. 65, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 2 to 12. 0) or a C-min >= 15 mg/L (OR 1. 8, 95 % CI 0. 4 to 8. 5). Conclusions: This study demonstrated large interindividual variability in vancomycin pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic target attainment in ICU patients. These data suggests that a re-evaluation of current vancomycin dosing recommendations in critically ill patients is needed to more rapidly and consistently achieve sufficient vancomycin exposure...|$|R
50|$|When {{commissioned}} in 1943, Howrah was the 3rd-longest {{cantilever bridge}} in the world, behind Pont de Québec (549 m) in Canada and Forth Bridge (521 m) in Scotland. It has since been surpassed by three bridges, making it the sixth-longest cantilever {{bridge in the}} world in 2013. It is a suspension type balanced cantilever bridge, with a central span 1,500 ft between centers of main towers and a suspended span of 564 ft. The main towers are 280 ft high above the monoliths and 76 ft apart at the top. The anchor arms are 325 ft each, while the cantilever arms are 468 ft each. The bridge deck hangs from panel points in the lower chord of the main trusses with 39 pairs of hangers. The roadways beyond the towers are supported from ground, leaving the anchor arms free from deck load. The deck system includes cross girders suspended between the pairs of hangers by a pinned connection. Six rows of longitudinal stringer girders are arranged between cross girders. Floor beams are supported transversally on top of the stringers, while themselves supporting a <b>continuous</b> pressed steel <b>troughing</b> system surfaced with concrete.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} acute effects of high glucose {{concentrations}} on vascular reactivity in the isolated non diabetic rabbit kidney. METHODS: Rabbits were anaesthetized for {{isolation of the}} kidneys. Renal arteries and veins were cannulated for perfusion with Krebs-Henselleit solution and measurement of perfusion pressure. After 3 hours of perfusion with glucose 5, 5 mM (control) and 15 mM, the circulation was submitted to sub maximal precontraction (80 % of maximal response) <b>trough</b> <b>continuous</b> infusion of noradrenaline 10 mM. Vascular reactivity was then assessed trough dose-responses curves with endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and independent (sodium nitroprusside) vasodilators. The influence of hyperosmolarity was analyzed with perfusion with mannitol 15 mM. RESULTS: A significant reduction in the endothelium-dependent vasodilation in glucose 15 mM group was observed compared to that in control, {{but there was no}} difference in endothelium-independent vasodilation. After perfusion with mannitol 15 mM, a less expressive reduction in endothelium-dependent vasodilation was observed, only reaching significance in regard to the greatest dose of acetylcholine. CONCLUSION: High levels of glucose similar to those found in diabetic patients in the postprandial period can cause significant acute changes in renal vascular reactivity rabbits. In diabetic patients these effects may also occur and contribute to diabetes vascular disease...|$|R
40|$|A {{finite element}} (FE) model was {{calibrated}} using the {{data obtained from}} a full-scale test to failure of a 50 year old reinforced concrete (RC) railway bridge. The model was then {{used to assess the}} effectiveness of various strengthening schemes to increase the loadcarrying capacity of the bridge. The bridge was a two-span <b>continuous</b> single-track <b>trough</b> bridge with a total length of 30 m, situated in Örnsköldsvik in northern Sweden. It was tested in situ as the bridge had been closed following {{the construction of a new}} section of the Railway line. The test was planned to evaluate and calibrate models to predict the load-carrying capacity of the bridge and assess the strengthening schemes originally developed by the European research project called Sustainable bridges. The objective of the test was to investigate shear failure, rather than bending failure for which good calibrated models are already available. To that end, the bridge was strengthened in flexure before the test using near-surface mounted square section carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) bars. The ultimate failure mechanism turned into an interesting combination of bending, shear, torsion, and bond failures at an applied load of 11. 7 MN (2, 630 kips). A computer model was developed using specialized software to represent the response of the bridge during the test. It was calibrated using data from the test and was then used to calculate the actual capacity of the bridge in terms of train loading using the current Swedish load model which specifies a 330 kN (74 kips) axle weight. These calculations show that the unstrengthened bridge could sustain a load 4. 7 times greater than the current load requirements (which is over six times the original design loading), whilst the strengthened bridge could sustain a load 6. 5 times greater than currently required.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{studies have}} focused on the {{question}} of the stratigraphic sequence and thus the stages of tessera formation, specifically, if tessera re formed by contractional deformation followed by extensional deformation or vice versa. A major question centers on the interpretation of specific lineaments within tesserae as graben (bounded by faults-• 60 ø) or, alternatively, open tension fractures (dipping-• 90 ø). We document and assess the origin of extensional structures in tesserae at several locations on Venus, noting the morphology, continuity along strike, parallelism of walls, stratigraphic position and interaction with other structures, and variability due to radar viewing geometry. In each study area, our analyses demonstrate that (1) the extensional structures have variable widths, interior subparallel lineaments, and ramp terminations; (2) ridges and lineaments are <b>continuous</b> across the <b>troughs,</b> where the floors of many of these structures contain the lowered sections of preexisting structures; and (3) intratessera plains are seen to embay ridges and an impact crater is superposed on a ridge and in both cases these features are subsequently deformed by the extensional structures. We conclude that the morphology of these extensional structures is consistent with an origin as graben, not open tension fractures, and that these graben postdate the ridges in each study area. Both the graben and the ridges of the sizes found in our survey can b...|$|R
