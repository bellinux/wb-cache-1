Current reporting practices in China and its trading partners do not fully reflect this role and therefore provide a misleading picture of the origin or ultimate destination of Chinese exports and imports. We adjust bilateral trade data for both China and its trading partners to correct for this problem. We also correct for differences due to markups in Hong Kong and different standards for reporting trade (<b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>f.</b> versus <b>f.</b> o. b.). For 2003, we estimate that China's overall trade surplus was between $ 53 billion and $ 126 billion, larger than that reported in official Chinese data, but smaller than that reported by China's trading partners. We also provide evidence that, in general, the actual origin of a good that is transshipped through Hong Kong is correctly reported by the importing country, but the final destination of such goods is not correctly reported by the exporting country.

Phase partition in hexadecane or octan- 1 - 01 was similar for C. diflcife and E. coli, as was retention by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), indicating moderate hydrophobicity. The salt agglutination test showed E. cofi to be hydrophobic and <b>C.</b> d <b>i</b> <b>f</b> <b>f</b> <b>i</b> <b>f</b> e to be hydrophilic. Relative hydrophobicity determined by HIC when charge effects were not nullified, i. e., to reflect more closely conditions in vivo, showed C. difficile to bind less well. Growth of C. difficife in caecal emulsions to simulate conditions in vivo did {{not alter the}} cell surface hydrophobicity. The phase partition method for charge determination indicated that E. cofi and C. diflcile had a net negative charge, although this was weaker for C. dijjWfe than E. cofi. However, although E. cofi exhibited a net negative charge as determined by immuno-gold electronmicroscopy (IGEM), {{in keeping with the}} results of the phase partition method, C. dvficife was shown to be predominantly positively charged by IGEM, and by movement in a charged field as determined by paper electrophoresis and a novel method based on light microscope observation. A cell-wall deficient mutant of C. diflcife was weakly positively charged, showing that most of the charge resides in the cell wall...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Government {{intervention}} in food grain markets {{is a common}} feature of most LDCs. Inasmuch as liberalizing markets is difficult {{for some of these}} governments, researchers have offered suggestions to reduce detrimental affects of intervention. The general advice for pricing policy has been for governments to set prices at <b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>f.</b> or <b>f.</b> o. b. border prices. In countries where <b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>f.</b> and <b>f.</b> o. b. prices are very different and the countries are marginally self-sufficient, this advice is inadequate. Analysis on which this general advice is based fail to take this and government motivations explicitly into account. This thesis develops a more flexible model that rationalizes controlled price and stock policy making and takes into account the case of marginally self-sufficient economies. In the framework used, government is assumed to set policy levels as a result of optimizing the expected weighted sum of social incomes to consumers, producers, and taxpayers. Resulting from this optimizing are revealed preferences. Assuming Zimbabwe was optimizing such an objective function from 1954 to 1986, these revealed preference functions were estimated using policy levels and exogenous factors affecting policy for this period. Estimation of the model on Zimbabwe showed that the government set price and stock policies with the expectation of future exports. Results also show that Zimbabwe has, on average, fully adjusted its producer prices to world prices during the 1954 to 1986 period. Wholesale prices have only partially adjusted to world prices. The government in addition was influenced by supply and demand conditions. Estimates also show that government held stocks in order to speculate on world prices and that stocks were influenced by previous years' net domestic supply. The model estimated also allowed for recovery of implicit weights the government has accorded the different economic groups in policy making. Results show that the Zimbabwe government has weighted consumer, producer, and public sector interests roughly in proportions 0. 30, 0. 35, and 0. 35. Since these differ little, results seem to indicate on the average the government has been setting prices to maximize long-run efficiency. Tests showed the model was not very sensitive to small changes in demand and supply slopes. A number of simulations were conducted to determine effects of exogenous factors and alternative weighting schemes on income distribution and social income stability. Weighting all groups equally resulted in Z$ 3. 13 million more social income than had the optimal solution. However, it reduced stability of incomes in the face of varying exogenous shocks such as in world prices, prices of substitutes, and wage-income. It also reduced total production and exports. Reduction in production was not enough to convert the country from a net exporter to net importer. Thus, intervention has helped growth in the corn industry and stabilized incomes. Also tested were the scenarios in which economic groups are weighted on the basis of populations and the scenario in which government exercises full monopoly power. The former resulted in less total income and more instability in social income and export earnings. The later resulted in maximal revenue to the government agency but reduced production far enough that corn self-sufficiency gave way to net imports...|$|R

These factors were instability line, the convergence zone, the cyclogenesis, the country-wide rain, the cold- and warm weather fronts, the maritime- and continental moderate, arctic and subtropical air masses used the data published in "Calendar of Weather Phenomena" between 1967 and 1990 by National Meteorological Service. There were 29832 moths caught during 3232 night by 64 light-trap {{stations in the}} examined period. During one night more light-traps operated, therefore 25. 021 observing data were worked up. We mean that the observing data {{are the same as}} the catching data at one night, at one observing station. The data of meteorological events were collected into groups according to their occurrence on one day alone or together with other ones. They were collected into separated groups according to arriving after a day without any meteorological events or if there were any of them on the previous day. The values of relative catch (RC) were calculated daily for each observing stations and generations used the catching data. There was made a comparison between the relative catch (RC) values and the meteorological events belonging to the data and on previous and following days. Then the relative catch values were summarized and averaged daily. The differences of daily average values of significance levels were controlled with t-test in all the groups. More than 95 % significance levels were found in 36 groups. The favourable and infavourable influences of each event are the strongest at that time, when have influence not only alone but also with other effects simultaneously or they follow one another in a short time. Our results prove clearly, {{it is not enough to}} examine exclusively the modifying influence of each meteorological event on light-trap collecting. The success of light trapping is modified depending on several combinations of each meteorological event and they are not very often the same as the catching result of event to have an influence only...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{zebrafish}} to fully regenerate its caudal fin has been explored {{to better understand}} the mechanisms underlying de novo bone formation and to develop screening methods towards the discovery of compounds with therapeutic potential. Quantifying caudal fin regeneration largely depends on successfully measuring new tissue formation through methods that require optimization and standardization. Here, we present an improved methodology to characterize and analyse overall caudal fin and bone regeneration in adult zebrafish. First, regenerated and mineralized areas are evaluated through broad, rapid and specific chronological and morphometric analysis in alizarin red stained fins. Then, following a more refined strategy, the intensity of the staining within a 2 D longitudinal plane is determined through pixel intensity analysis, as an indicator of density or thickness/ volume. The applicability of this methodology on live specimens, to reduce animal experimentation and provide a tool for in vivo tracking of the regenerative process, was successfully demonstrated. Finally, the methodology was validated on retinoic acid- and warfarin-treated specimens, and further confirmed by micro-computed tomography. Because it is easily implementable, accurate and does not require sophisticated equipment, the present methodology will certainly provide valuable technical standardization for research in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and skeletal biology.

It is the main goal of this paper to analyze this group, which is a central extension of a group of diffeomorphisms by a group of pseudo-differential operators which is slightly different from the one developped in the mathematical litterature e. g. by H. Omori and by T. Ratiu. We show that these groups are regular, and develop the necessary properties for applications to the geometry of B (M, N). A case of particular interest is M = S 1, where connected components of B + (S 1, N) are deeply linked with homotopy classes of oriented knots. In this example, the structure group of the tangent space T B + (S 1, N) is a subgroup of some group G L r e s, following the classical notations of (Pressley, A., 1988). These constructions suggest some approaches in the spirit of one of our previous works on Chern-Weil theory that could lead to knot invariants through a theory of Chern-Weil forms...|$|R

40|$|In {{establishing}} {{the value of}} imports for tariff assessment, most countries apply duties either to the cost-insurance-freight (<b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>f.)</b> or the free-on-board (<b>f.</b> o. b.) value of the traded good. One effect of using the far more common <b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>f.</b> base is to place a disproportinate burden on countries that have higher freight and insurance costs. Distant countries often not only pay higher transport costs, but are further penalized by disproportionate tariff costs that worsen their competitive disadvantage. The <b>f.</b> o. b. valuation procedure does not penalize exporters for their location, but applies a nominal tariff rate directly to the export costs of each country. Using cost information for six Latin American countries, this paper examines {{the influence of the}} two procedures on the level and incidence of tariff protection. It concludes that transport and insurance costs generally put developing countries at a disadvantage (compared to developed countries) on interregional trade and that the relatively high Latin American tariffs on <b>c.</b> <b>i.</b> <b>f.</b> prices further worsen their competitive position.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{address the}} problem of visual recognition of non-rigid objects. I introduce the frame alignment approach to recognition and illustrate it in two types of non-rigid objects: contour textures and elongated flexible objects. Frame alignment is based on matching stored models to images and has three stages: first, a "frame curve" and a corresponding object are computed in the image. Second, the object is brought into correspondence with the model by aligning the model axis with the object axis; if the object is not rigid it is "unbent" achieving a canonical description for recognition. Finally, object and model are matched against each other. Rigid and elongated flexible objects are matched using all contour information. Contour textures are matched using filter outputs around the frame curve. The central contribution of this thesis is Curved Inertia Frames (<b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>F.),</b> a scheme for computing frame curves directly on the image. <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>F.</b> is the first algorithm which can c [...] ...|$|R

In particular we study the ability of the genetic algorithm to develop a proportional-integral (PI) controller and a state feedback controller for a non-linear multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) plant model. The plant model is presented along with a discussion of the inherent d <b>i</b> <b>f</b> <b>f</b> <b>i</b> <b>c</b> u l t i e s in such contro l l er development. A sketch of the genetic algorithm (GA) is presented and its strategy as a method of control system design is discussed. Results are presented for two different control systems that have been designed with the genetic algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The study {{looks at}} the a <b>c</b> t <b>i</b> v i t i e s of pupils i n the {{playground}} at lunch time i n a small rural secondary school. The disquiet <b>f</b> e l t about pupils behaviour and the increasing awareness of b u l l y i n g make i t important {{to look at this}} aspect of school l <b>i</b> <b>f</b> e. Playtime is largely a pupils world, especially in the secondary school where there i s very l i t t le supervision. The study set out to investigate three interlocking aspect of l <b>i</b> <b>f</b> e in the playground; What patterns of a n t <b>i</b> s o <b>c</b> <b>i</b> a l behaviour are there; how are the patterns of pupils a <b>c</b> t <b>i</b> v i t i e s related to their age and gender; and is there a spatial pattern to a <b>c</b> t <b>i</b> v i t i e s in terms of the play space. The study was carried out using three research instruments. A whole school questionnaire, a pupil participatory observation technique and a more s p e <b>c</b> <b>i</b> <b>f</b> <b>i</b> <b>c</b> questionnaire for year nine pupils. The main findings show that there {{is a certain amount of}} b u l l y i n g in the play space. This i s. r e l a t e d to age, gender and location. Generally lower school boys are the main source of a n t <b>i</b> s o <b>c</b> <b>i</b> a l behaviour and i t occurs out of sight and in enclosed areas of the play space. The patterns of a <b>c</b> t <b>i</b> v i t y differ with gender, boys a <b>c</b> t <b>i</b> v i t i e s tend to be physical, while girls tend to occupy themselves i n s o <b>c</b> <b>i</b> a l a <b>c</b> t <b>i</b> v i t i es such as talking and walking. The nature and popularity of a <b>c</b> t <b>i</b> v i t i es such as chasing games, <b>f</b> o o t b a l l and using the l i b r a r y, change with the age of pupils. There seems to be a pattern of development from physical to passive a <b>c</b> t <b>i</b> v i t i e s as pupils grow older. The environment of the play space has a part to play in the nature of the a <b>c</b> t <b>i</b> v i t i es that go on there. Factors such as the size and shape of the play space, its proximity to form rooms and the v i s i b i l i t y of i t from the s t a <b>f</b> <b>f</b> room or heads office, seem to determine how i t i s used by pupils.
