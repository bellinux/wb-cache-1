50|$|Long {{after the}} triumph of the Church of Scotland in the Lowlands, Highlanders and Islanders clung to a form of Christianity infused with animistic folk beliefs and practices. The cults of saints like Bride and Maelrubha persisted, beside rituals like the {{sacrifice}} of bulls and the <b>cleansing</b> of <b>milk,</b> along with tales of fairies, kelpies and other beasts. There had been localised success during the Reformation, undermined by a shortage of Gaelic-speaking clergy and the vast scale and inaccessibility of some parishes.|$|R
30|$|Cleaning of {{equipment}} {{used in the}} milk storage and transportation is highly crucial activity to minimize microbial contamination of milk and subsequently to improve its microbiological safety (O’Connor 1995). In this regard, {{it is recommended that}} water used in cleaning {{of equipment}} and processing of milk should have quality standard equivalent to drinking water (Terplan 1980). However, in most developing countries like Ethiopia, smallholder dairy farmers and informal milk retailers may not have access to water source of such a good quality or if so, contamination can be a problem during handling or storage of water (Amenu 2013). Consequently, poor quality water can be a major contributing factor for the low quality and safety of milk and milk products. Microbial contamination of drinking water during handling or storage after collection is often significant problems in many developing countries where water transportation and storage for later use is a common practice (Wright et al. 2004). Similarly, the microbiological quality of water destined for washing and <b>cleansing</b> of <b>milk</b> equipment can be seriously affected by the handling and storage conditions.|$|R
50|$|Various ear {{diseases}} and infections {{are treated with}} eardrops containing triethanolamine polypeptide oleate-condensate, such as Cerumenex in the United States. In pharmaceutics, triethanolamine is the active ingredient of some eardrops used to treat impacted earwax. It {{also serves as a}} pH balancer in many different cosmetic products, ranging from <b>cleansing</b> creams and <b>milks,</b> skin lotions, eye gels, moisturizers, shampoos, shaving foams, and so on. TEA is a fairly strong base: a 1% solution has a pH of approximately 10, whereas the pH of skin is less than pH 7, approximately 5.5−6.0. Cleansing milk-cream emulsions based on TEA are particularly good at removing makeup. (HOCH2)3N was used in the synthesis of amustaline.|$|R
50|$|After his father's (King Mahendra) {{death in}} 1972, King Birendra {{consulted}} his court astrologers, who {{advised him to}} delay his coronation for three years, with the most auspicious moment for his crowning being at 8:37 am precisely on February 4, 1975. Soon after dawn on that day, King Birendra was driven to the temple of his ancestral palace, the Hanuman Dhoka ("gate of the monkey god"). There he was smeared with mud taken from various symbolic places - {{the bottom of a}} lake, the tusk of an elephant, a mountain, the confluence of two rivers and the doorstep of a prostitute's house. Then, with Queen Aishwarya beside him, he was <b>cleansed</b> with butter, <b>milk,</b> yogurt and honey as priests chanted praises and salutations.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 A water-to-water {{heat pump}} was {{specifically}} designed and operated to temper process water for <b>cleansing</b> and sanitizing <b>milking</b> parlor equipment using recovered {{energy from the}} milk refrigeration system as its heat source. Operation of the water-to-water heat pump in series with the energy recovery system {{was found to be}} both energy conserving and economically feasible. The study compared water usage and electrical energy consumption for the period before and after installation of the complete energy recycling system. A 53 percent reduction in electrical energy consumption for tempering low (43. 3 °C) and high (71. 1 °C) grade hot water resulted. An average coefficient of performance of 4. 05 was realized for the heat pump, indicating that with rigid water (energy) conservation practices improved performance would result. Several developments were suggested by the study which may improve overall system performance and further reduce energy consumption. The use of a water-to-water heat pump for tempering water appears to have a promising future for dairy farm applications...|$|R

40|$|Mastitis causes largest {{economic}} losses in dairy production. Sub-clinical mastitis is detected in 50 % of lactating cows in Lithuania. Curing effect is transient if major causes and factors of mastitis are not eliminated. Prophylactic measures are directed {{to strengthen the}} immune system of the cow and to define and to eliminate all factors causing mastitis. Bacteria are present on skin of the teat in the surroundings. Use of antiseptics of cow teats before and after milking {{is the most effective}} preventive procedure that can prevent from new mastitis cases. Antiseptic solutions help to fight most opportunistic and contagious bacterial infections causing mastitis. Teat antiseptics can reduce mastitis incidence by 50 to 75 %. It is recommended to use antiseptic solutions for udder and teats, as they improve physical condition of the udder and milk quality. Agents for udder and teat antiseptics contain bactericidal, skin protecting components in aqueous solution. Bactericidal activity is defined to kill germs during chemical and biological reactions. Active ingredients are iodoforms, chlorhexidins, sodium hypochloride, sodium chloride, lactic acid, hypochloric acid, antimicrobial proteins and fatty acids. Teat dipping reduces bacterial milk contamination, and spreading of pathogens on the teats during the milking. For the present moment this procedure is also used in Europe. Spraying teats with two different concentrations of iodine solution before and after the milking effectively reduces skin contamination with staphylococcal and colliform bacteria. Action of pre-dip and post-dip is similar. The aim of our investigation was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} antiseptic materials used before and after milking on bulk milk bacterial contamination, somatic cell count and incidences of sub-clinical mastitis. We selected in farm No. 1, cows with 500 000 103 /ml somatic cell count. In this farm antiseptic teat dipping was routinely used after milking. In this farm we also used disincentive wood shave for udder cleansing. Udders were <b>cleansed</b> before each <b>milking</b> using 5 to 10 g. disincentive wood shave soaked in water. No significant changes were observed after the use of this udder cleansing method. At the start of the experiment in Farm No. 1, total bacterial count was 57. 33 ± 9. 45 103 /ml. and 7 days following the treatment decreased to 49. 11 ± 9. 45 103 /ml. One month after the treatment total bacterial count was 43. 67 ± 7. 82 103 /ml (p> 0. 5). These changes in were not statistically significant. Somatic cell count was 507. 89 ± 47. 40 103 /ml. One month after the treatment somatic cell count was 199. 33 ± 41. 69 103 /ml (p> 0. 1). These changes in were not statistically In farm No. 2, no antiseptic substances were used before the experiment. Before each milking, udders were routinely cleaned with damp towels. At the start of the experiment, udders were cleansed with disincentive wood shave and teats were dipped following the milking. At the start of the experiment, the results were worse – total bacterial count increased, as well as somatic cell count. Microbial contamination of udder was higher at the start of the experiment, compared to the end. At the start of use of antiseptic substances, bacterial udder contamination significantly decreased, and this resulted in decreased milk bacterial contamination and milk somatic cell count. At the start of the experiment in Farm No. 1, total bacterial count was 46. 33 ± 8. 23 103 /ml. and 7 days following the treatment decreased to 40. 21 ± 7. 33 103 /ml. One month after the treatment total bacterial count was 35. 24 ± 7. 82 103 /ml (p> 0, 5). These changes in were not statistically significant. Somatic cell count was 340. 0 ± 36. 93 103 /ml. One month after the treatment somatic cell count was 122. 17 ± 12. 08 103 /ml (p> 0. 1). These changes in were not statistically Wood shave was used for udder cleaning in the farm. Many farms use this cleaning method for the present time. It is very effective to remove rests of bedding and manure from the teats. It is enough 5 to 10 g. of wood shave to clean udder ant teats. The shave can also be soaked with antiseptic solution. One more advantage is that teat cleansing with wood shave more intensively stimulates milk let-down. We, however, did not observe an increase in milk production during our experiment, but this cleansing method had positive effect reducing bacterial contamination of udder. Analysis data shows that antiseptic materials must be used before and after the milking, because teat canal is open 30 min. after the milking...|$|R
