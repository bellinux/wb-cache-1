25|$|A retail {{electricity}} market exists when end-use {{customers can}} choose their supplier from competing electricity retailers; one term {{used in the}} United States {{for this type of}} consumer choice is 'energy choice'. A separate issue for electricity markets is whether or not consumers face real-time pricing (prices based on the variable wholesale price) or a price that is set in some other way, such as average annual costs. In many markets, <b>consumers</b> <b>do</b> not pay based on the real-time price, and hence have no incentive to reduce demand at times of high (wholesale) prices or to shift their demand to other periods. Demand response may use pricing mechanisms or technical solutions to reduce peak demand.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} contemporary {{dimension to}} misrepresentations is the statutory regulation of business, and enforcement measures by the Office of Fair Trading against unfair trade practices. Typically <b>consumers</b> <b>do</b> not understand legal complexities and have {{little incentive to}} litigate over small claims. Statute may also strengthen enforcement of consumer protection by providing criminal or regulatory sanctions. The Trade Descriptions Act 1968 ss 1-4 say that not only false, but also misleading statements about products are prohibited. An early example is found in Robertson v Dicicco where it was held that describing a vehicle as a ‘beautiful car’ was implicitly saying it was fit for purpose. Though the exterior was attractive, it was still a misrepresentation when the car did not work. Similarly the Consumer Protection Act 1987 ss 20-21 create an offence for giving misleading information about the prices of goods and services, such as banking or insurance. On top of this the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, give a broad principle based jurisdiction to courts and the OFT to clamp down on misleading practices or omissions by businesses.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 July 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{issued a}} {{regulation}} requiring manufacturers to list trans fat on the Nutrition Facts panel of foods and some dietary supplements. The new labeling rule became mandatory across the board, even {{for companies that}} petitioned for extensions, on 1 January 2008. However, unlike in many other countries, trans fat levels of less than 0.5grams per serving can be listed as 0grams trans fat on the food label. According to {{a study published in}} the Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, without an interpretive footnote or further information on recommended daily value, many <b>consumers</b> <b>do</b> not know how to interpret the meaning of trans fat content on the Nutrition Facts panel. In fact, without specific prior knowledge about trans fat and its negative health effects, consumers, including those at risk for heart disease, may misinterpret nutrient information provided on the panel. The FDA did not approve nutrient content claims such as [...] "trans fat free" [...] or [...] "low trans fat", as they could not determine a [...] "recommended daily value". Nevertheless, the agency is planning a consumer study to evaluate the consumer understanding of such claims and perhaps consider a regulation allowing their use on packaged foods. However, there is no requirement to list trans fats on institutional food packaging; thus bulk purchasers such as schools, hospitals, jails and cafeterias are unable to evaluate the trans fat content of commercial food items.|$|E
50|$|Sustainable {{consumer}} behaviour is consumers’ behaviors that improve {{social and environmental}} performance as well as meet their needs. It studies why and how <b>consumers</b> <b>do</b> or do not incorporate sustainability issues into their consumption behaviour. Also, it studies what products <b>consumers</b> <b>do</b> or do not buy, how they use them {{and what they do}} with them afterwards. One mechanism to spread information about sustainable {{consumer behaviour}} is word of mouth.|$|E

5000|$|Each day {{consumers}} {{make choices}} {{as to which}} products {{they would like to}} use based on their needs and the different brands available. However, most <b>consumers</b> <b>do</b> not take into consideration the environmental impacts of the product when they make their choice.
