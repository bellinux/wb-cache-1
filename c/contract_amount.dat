5|$|Soon {{after its}} establishment, OCX decided to limit {{construction}} costs to $70million, a figure {{which is in}} addition to approximately $50million of plans, permits, and right-of-way donated by Avatar, who will not be reimbursed. Because of the cost limit, {{the decision was made}} to build a two-lane highway initially, using a design that will easily permit the road to be widened to a four- or six-lane expressway in the future. In July 2013, a design-build contract for the highway was awarded to Jr. Davis Construction Company, based in Kissimmee. The total <b>contract</b> <b>amount</b> was $69,013,443.76, representing $68,788,000.00 for the original contract and $225,443.76 for changes to the project after bidding.|$|E

40|$|Among {{the many}} {{challenges}} of integrating {{renewable energy sources}} into the existing power grid, is the challenge of integrating renewable energy generators into the power systems economy. Electricity markets currently are run {{in a way that}} participating generators must supply <b>contracted</b> <b>amounts.</b> And yet, renewable energy generators such as wind power generators cannot supply <b>contracted</b> <b>amounts</b> with certainty. Thus, alternative market architectures must be considered where there are aggregator entities who participate in the electricity market by buying power from the renewable energy generators, and assuming risk of any shortfall from <b>contracted</b> <b>amounts.</b> In this paper, we propose auction mechanisms that can be used by the aggregators for procuring stochastic resources, such as wind power. The nature of stochastic resources is different from classical resources in that such a resource is only available stochastically. The distribution of the generation is private information, and the system objective is to truthfully elicit such information. We introduce a variant of the VCG mechanism for this problem. We also propose a non-VCG mechanism with a contracted-payment-plus-penalty payoff structure. We generalize the basic mechanisms in various ways. We then consider the setting where there are two classes of players to demonstrate the difficulty of auction design in such scenarios. We also consider an alternative architecture where the generators need to fulfill any shortfall from the <b>contracted</b> <b>amount</b> by buying from the spot market...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we apply systems {{analysis}} methods to modeling financial instruments supporting the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) program. We consider a risk-aware forest owner and an electricity producer evaluating the REDD-based offsets with benefit-sharing mechanism under uncertain CO 2 prices. For a range of CO 2 prices and respective risks perceived by the forest owner (seller) and electricity producer (buyer), we apply a model of fair (indifference) pricing. The decision-making process under uncertainty is formalized {{in the spirit of}} Howard Raiffa’s “Decision analysis” (1968). Parties’ risk preferences are reflected by exponential utility functions. The potentially <b>contracted</b> <b>amounts</b> of REDD offsets are analyzed under various risk preferences and for different benefit sharing opportunities and price levels. Our results show that a risk-averse attitude considerably increases the <b>contracted</b> <b>amounts</b> of REDD offsets (compared to risk-neutral case) and, therefore, creates a higher potential for REDD implementation. We demonstrate a possibility of situations, when parties could agree on a certain range of REDD contracts, for example, smaller amounts of REDD offsets are traded for higher prices, and larger amounts for lower prices, but <b>contracting</b> a moderate <b>amount</b> at a moderate price is impossible. Higher benefit-sharing ratios can also increase <b>contracted</b> <b>amounts</b> even in the case of risk-taking electricity producer. Our modeling results highlight two ways to promote higher REDD participation: (i) increasing risk aversion of the energy producers, and (ii) implementing the mechanism of benefit/risk sharing between REDD consumer and supplier...|$|R
500|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{criticized the}} <b>contract</b> <b>amount,</b> {{considering}} it a gamble for Virgin. He stated that Jackson [...] "is a producer-dependent artist—i.e., someone who relies on others {{to make her}} sound interesting and trendy. She also lacks a sharply defined personality, both {{as an artist and}} celebrity. Where singers like Ms. Houston and Mariah Carey have commanding vocal power, Ms. Jackson's is a relatively indistinguishable studio voice." [...] Richard Branson rebutted this argument stating [...] "Ms. Jackson has met with great success working with the production team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, just as her brother Michael Jackson has experienced his greatest successes with the producer Quincy Jones. It is interesting that Mr. Holden doesn't mention this similar 'liability' when discussing Michael Jackson. To say that Ms. Jackson is 'dependent' on her producer is a shortsighted observation. She is a formidable talent who stands on her own." [...] Michael Jackson would break his sister's record only days later, when he signed a $60 million contract with Sony Music Entertainment. Both sibling's contracts garnered considerable criticism. Los Angeles Times reported that [...] "A Records President Al Cafaro, whose company lost the fierce bidding battle over Janet Jackson to Virgin Records, said record companies may be vesting too much importance in individual performers" [...] as the funds used as advances to the Jacksons could have launched recording careers for numerous unknown talents. Cliff Burnstein of Q-Prime [...] management commented that recording artists demands for advances upon signing would begin to escalate from that point forward.|$|E
500|$|Before the 1948 season started, team {{president}} Bill Veeck doubled Lemon's <b>contract</b> <b>amount.</b> It would be Lemon's first full {{season as a}} pitcher. Lemon was the Indians' number-two pitcher in the starting rotation, behind Bob Feller. On June 30, 1948, Lemon pitched a no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers in a 2–0 win, earning his 11th win and fifth shutout of the season. He became the ninth Indians pitcher to record a no-hitter and ended the season with an AL-best 20 complete games. His ten shutouts on the season were {{the most in the}} majors. [...] Lemon would go on to win the 1948 AL Pitcher of the Year Award. [...] With three games remaining in the regular season, 20-game winner Lemon started the first game of their final series against Detroit. Lemon allowed three runs on seven hits and the Indians lost the game. Cleveland lost two games of the three-game series, forcing a one-game playoff with the Boston Red Sox. Speculation built up around which Indians pitcher Boudreau would send to the mound against the Red Sox on October 4; the choices were largely narrowed down to Lemon and Satchel Paige. Lemon was listed as Cleveland's [...] "probable pitcher" [...] by United Press International in morning newspapers the day of the game, even though he would be working on two days of rest. Instead, Boudreau went with Gene Bearden, who would be pitching on one day of rest, and the choice was solidified when veteran second baseman Joe Gordon spoke up in support of Boudreau at a team meeting. The Indians won the game at Fenway Park by a score of 8–3 and prepared to face the Boston Braves in the World Series.|$|E
