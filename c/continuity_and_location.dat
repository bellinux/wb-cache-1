40|$|The {{mandarin}} keyword spotting {{system was}} investigated, {{and a new}} approach was proposed {{based on the principle}} of homology <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> point <b>location</b> analysis in high-dimensional space geometry theory which are both parts of biomimetic pattern recognition theory. This approach constructed a hyper-polyhedron with sample points in the training set and calculated the distance between each test point and the hyper-polyhedron. The classification resulted from the value of those distances. The approach was tested by a speech database which was created by ourselves. The performance was compared with the classic HMM approach and the results show that the new approach is much better than HMM approach when the training data is not sufficient...|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{to gain an}} {{understanding}} of how women conceptualise continuity of maternity care. Design: a qualitative study involving in-depth semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. Setting: a range of urban and rural public hospitals in New South Wales, Australia. Participants: 53 women aged 18 - 44 years (median age 27 years) receiving maternity care in 2011 - 2012. Findings: responses from women suggested five types of continuity: continuity of staff, continuity of relationship, continuity of information, <b>continuity</b> across pregnancies, <b>and</b> <b>continuity</b> across <b>locations.</b> The types of continuity differed by parity <b>and</b> <b>location.</b> Conclusion <b>and</b> implications for practice: continuity of maternity care has a variety of meanings to women. If healthcare providers are to commit to providing woman-centred maternity care it is important to recognise the diversity of women’s experiences, and ensure that systems of care are flexible and appropriate to women’s circumstances and needs.

50|$|During {{the medieval}} period, Dublin was {{surrounded}} by manorial settlements comprising church, graveyard, manor house, motte and bailey, farms and cottages. These settlements grew into a network of villages around Dublin creating stability <b>and</b> <b>continuity</b> of <b>location.</b> Crumlin Village developed as an Anglo-Norman settlement soon after the Norman Conquest in 1170, (although the circular configuration of the old graveyard of Saint Mary’s in the village suggests pre-Norman associations), and has survived through the centuries to become the village of today. The Old Saint Mary's Church stands {{on the site of}} a 12th-century church of the same dedication, and a succession of churches occupied the site down through the centuries to the present day.|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Previous {{research}} {{has examined the}} effect of family physician continuity of care within end-of-life care cancer patients and its association with reduced use of acute care services. However, such {{research has}} not been examined {{in the end of}} life homecare cancer population. Objectives: To investigate the association of family physician continuity with location of death, hospital and emergency room (ER) visits in the last 2 weeks of life in end of life homecare cancer patients. Research Design: Retrospective study involving secondary data analysis of 7 linked databases. Subjects: All those who died of cancer between January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006 in Ontario who had at least 1 visit to a family physician and enrolled in homecare for at least 2 weeks. Methods: The relationship of family physician <b>continuity</b> of care <b>and</b> <b>location</b> of death, <b>and</b> hospital and ER visits in the last 2 weeks of life was examined using logistic regression. Results: The Usual Provider of Care (UPC) measure demonstrated a dose response relationship with increasing continuity resulting in decreased odds of dying in the hospital and visitin...|$|R

40|$|A family {{business}} {{refers to the}} ownership and management of specific business run by two or more members of a family. Such transactions are functionally varied and involve diverse industrial activities playing {{a pivotal role in}} national economy. The present essay aims to identify effective factors dominating the <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> decline of {{family business}}es to establish a conceptual model of <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> succession for family businesses. As such, 3 corollary questions were formulated: a) why does <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> succession in a family business last for two or three generations? b) What factors can guarantee the <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> decline of family businesses? c) Which factors are influential in governing <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> decline of family businesses? For this purpose, a descriptive research design was used in which from the population of successful owner managers running a family business in Iran, a sample of nine was selected using a purposive sampling method. Initially, the existing literature on family business was analyzed by Delph: a procedure based on which a questionnaire with 24 statements addressing the <b>continuity</b> <b>and</b> decline of family businesses was developed. Then, a semi-structure...|$|R
