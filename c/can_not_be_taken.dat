25|$|There are {{two main}} {{exceptions}} to the normal laws regarding line-outs. One is a line-out following a penalty {{and the other is}} the quick throw-in. If a team is awarded a penalty they have the option of kicking the ball into touch for a line-out. They can kick the ball directly into touch from anywhere on the field and the line-out will take place where the ball crossed the line. They also get to throw the ball in at the line-out. A quick throw in occurs when a player throws the ball in before the line-out has had a chance to form. The ball can be thrown in anywhere from where the ball crossed the sideline to the players own goal line. The same ball that went into touch must be used and if the ball has touched another person (not including the person throwing it in, but including other players, replacements, spectators, coaching staff or anyone else not involved in the game) or a line-out has formed (two players from each team) then a quick throw in <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b> The ball must travel five metres before it is touches the ground or a player and can only be thrown in straight or backwards.|$|E

As it makes its way through the town centre to Firepool weir and the junction with the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, it passes under the North Bridge, which was constructed in 1895, and Priory Bridge Road. Next comes the A358 Obridge viaduct, the A38 Bathpool Bridge and the M5 motorway bridge. Firepool weir was reconstructed in 1967 as part of the plans to straighten the river through the town centre and down to Bathpool in order to provide better flood defences. These works swept away the remains of the original navigation. There is a disused five-arched railway bridge built in 1863 at Creech St Michael. Nearby is the aqueduct that carried the Chard Canal over the river from 1842 until 1866. The Brewhouse Theatre & Arts Centre, is close to the riverside. Ham weir stands as a reminder of the location of the lock there. After Knapp bridge, [...] the sluice at Newbridge marks the upper tidal limit of the river. Curry and Hay Moors, an area of low-lying fenland close to the river, are a Site of Special Scientific Interest. A railway bridge carries the Taunton to Castle Cary railway line over the river, after which is the Curry Moor pumping station. Two more road bridges at Athelney and Stanmoor cross the river before it joins the River Parrett at Burrowbridge, where the junction is overshadowed by Burrow Mump.|$|E

The opposing team must stand still with their hands beside their sides until after the ball has been kicked at the goal. If the ball is kicked into touch the team that kicked it gets the throw in at the resulting line-out and it is always taken where the ball crosses the line. Free kicks are similar, except a shot at goal <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> and if the ball is kicked into touch the kicking team does not receive the throw at the ensuing line-out. There is also no gain in ground from the free kick if kicked directly into touch, unless it was taken from behind the kicking team's 22-metre line. Opposition players can also try and charge down free kicks as soon as the kicker makes a move to kick. The captain can always choose to take a scrum from a penalty or free kick. A player can claim a mark by catching the ball directly from a kick (except a kick-off) inside their own 22 and shouting [...] "mark" [...] at the same time.

In order to consider it in the layout optimization process, designers usually use their expertise to modify the layout problem description and satisfy a priori all the accessibility specifications. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on the integration of the accessibility to components in the layout problem formulation. The accessibility is considered as a design constraint or an objective of the optimization problem. This method is applied on a two dimensional real-world problem which deals with the layout optimization of components inside a shelter.
