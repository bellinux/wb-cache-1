40|$|<b>Composition</b> <b>cork</b> can be {{regarded}} as an interesting solution for light-damped sandwich panels. Despite the emergent interest on these materials for structural applications, {{there is a lack of}} information concerning its static and dynamic properties. This study presents a comparative study on a set of different experimental characterization methodologies applied on a selected agglomerated cork for vibration damping applications. The obtained results support the assumption of an air spring/viscous-based mechanism ruling the low-frequency behaviour of these materials. This assumed behaviour is a result from the observations of the cellular microstructure of natural and composition corks. Indicative values for the Young’s modulus, storage modulus and loss factor are provided as results from this study. In addition, a multilayer beam finite element, based on a mixed formulation, is proposed to be applied in an inverse characterization methodology and to be used also for the experimental validation tasks. The finite element proved to be efficient and accurate. (Not applicable...|$|E

40|$|Doutoramento em Engenharia Florestal e dos Recursos Naturais - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaQuercus cerris bark was {{studied with}} the {{following}} objectives: i) to study bark anatomy, ii) to separate and determine chemical <b>composition</b> of <b>cork,</b> iii) to analyze the thermal behavior of cork, iv) to investigate the use of cork as adsorbent of pollutants in aqueous environments and v) to compare the results obtained with those from Quercus suber. The bark of Q. cerris is composed of phloem, periderm and rhytidome. The rhytidome contains various sequential periderms with large portions of cork and many sclerified tissues. The cork structure {{is similar to that}} of Q. suber, but the cells are smaller and have higher solid fraction. The chemical <b>composition</b> of <b>cork</b> of Q. cerris {{is similar to that of}} Q. suber but suberin content is less and it is formed largely by ω-hidroxyacids. The thermal degradation starts at 200 °C and increases with temperature and treatment time. Suberin was thermically more resistant. The colour was altered until 40 % of mass loss.

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{research}} on carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) shows an evident progression not necessarily {{only in the}} field of aerospace industry. With their inherent superior specific strength and stiffness, CFRP offer an interesting option also for various machine tool components manufacturing. CFRP are generally weak in material damping. Nevertheless, this dynamic nature of CFRP parts can be successfully improved on the basis of so-called synergistic effect by the integration of particular damping layers made of rubber or <b>cork</b> <b>composition.</b> However, these additive layers can adversely influence strength and stiffness of resulting hybrid structure. This paper deals with finding of optimal lay-up of wound square tube consisting of CFRP layers with high modulus fibres and <b>cork</b> <b>composition</b> layers. For this purpose, the Pareto optimization of the square tube was performed using three-dimensional numerical simulations. The aim was to maximize the static bending stiffness, the natural frequency and the damping ratio. The theoretical studies were followed by experimental determination of dynamic characteristic of two selected specimens using impact hammer modal testing (IHMT) method and the results were compared...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenolic}} <b>composition</b> of <b>cork</b> {{powder and}} black condensate, two by-products from the cork industry, was {{investigated by the}} first time using high-performance liquid chromatography-multi-stage mass spectrometry (HPLC-MSn). The same methodology of extraction was applied to cork, for comparative purposes. Eighteen phenolic compounds were identified in cork, five of them are reported {{for the first time}} as its constituents. Sixteen and thirteen phenolic compounds were identified as cork powder and black condensate components, respectively, with only one compound of each residue published before as its constituent. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was evaluated, being, to our knowledge, the first study concerning the antioxidant activity of these cork residues. The extracts present an antioxidant activity higher than BHT, with black condensate showing the lowest IC 50 value. These results, together with the phenolic content values, demonstrate the high potential of these residues as source of high value compounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{lipophilic}} and phenolic extractives <b>composition</b> of <b>cork</b> of Quercus suber L. grown in Algeria by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatograhy-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS), respectively. The phenolic cork oak extract was also evaluated for its scavenging activity towards DPPH radical, ABTS radical scavenging, reducing power and antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC, Listeria innocua, Escherichia coil and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The lipophilic fraction is mainly composed of thirty three compounds, with cerine, friedeline and betulinic acid as the major components. Furthermore, eighteen phenolic compouds were detected in the phenolic extract, with protocatechuic, ellagic and gallic acids as the major compounds. The methanol:water cork extract showed high DPPH scavenging ability with an ICso value of 5. 69 mu g mL(- 1) and an ABTS enhanced scavenging capacity when compared to BHT and trolox. A reducing power higher than BHA was also found. In addition, the phenolic fraction of cork was shown to inhibit the growth of Staphelococcus aureus (12. 1 mm) and Pseudomonas aeroginisa (10. 07 mm). These results indicate that algerian cork oak constitutes {{a good source of}} natutal bioactive compounds. Morever, this study is a relevant contribution to the valorization of algerian cork industrial residues, for which novel applications could be considered, namely the use of these extracts in food or nutraceutical industry.

50|$|Unlike tiles {{which are}} made of minerals, {{resilient}} flooring is made of materials that have some elasticity, giving the flooring a degree of flexibility called resilience. The flooring is available in large sheets or pre-cut tiles, and either comes with pre-applied adhesive for peel-and-stick installation or requires adhesive to be troweled on to the substrate. Resilient flooring includes many different manufactured products including linoleum, sheet vinyl, vinyl <b>composition</b> tile (VCT), <b>cork</b> (sheet or tile), and rubber. Performance surfaces used for dance or athletics are usually made of wood or resilient flooring.The two basic categories of vinyl floor tiles are solid vinyl and vinyl composition, and the three basic categories of vinyl sheet flooring are homogeneous, inlaid, and layered composite. These types of vinyl flooring differ in manufacturing process and content, ranging in vinyl (polyvinyl chloride) content from 11% to 55%.|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} {{presents}} results from four subsequent sample collection campaigns utilizing {{remotely operated vehicle}} (ROV) dives with gas-tight fluid samplers (Seewald et al. 2001; Saegusa et al. 2006) and other sampling tools conducted between 2009 and 2012 to collect fresh fluids discharging from the cased borehole of Hole 1200 C. The chemistry of the CORK fluid, particularly dissolved gas species, {{as well as the}} microbial community composition and function were determined. Carbon and sulfur <b>compositions</b> in the <b>CORK</b> fluids were altered from those from the ODP porewater samples, probably due to changes in the subseafloor hydrological field before and after the scientific drilling event. Analyses of the CORK fluids and the ODP porewater suggested that the sulfate-methane couple likely co-exist in the native SCS formation fluid. However, low biomass and activity were observed environments where physical and chemical conditions, particularly the temperature (~[*] 3  °C) and bioavailable energy potentials, were suitable for supporting a prosperous microbial community. Multiple lines of evidence, such as low microbial biomass and activity, point to abiotic hydrocarbon synthesis associated with serpentinization occurring beneath the SCS.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{study on the}} chemical <b>composition</b> of oak <b>cork</b> (Quercus suber L.) and corresponding industrial residues and birch (Betula pendula L.) outer bark is reported. Cork oak samples have lower extractives contents (6 - 9 %) and higher contents of carbohydrates and lignin (23 - 27 and 33 - 38 %, respectively) than those found for birch outer bark (40, 6 and 9 %, respectively); suberin contents accounted for around 30 % of cork, 11 % of industrial cork powder and 45 % of birch outer bark. Analysis of the suberin monomeric composition revealed that C 18 and C 22 omega-hydroxyfatty acids (including mid-chain epoxy- and dihydroxy-derivatives), followed by alpha,omega-dicarboxylic acids, are the main components in both suberins, with 9, 10 -epoxy- 18 -hydroxyoctadecanoic, 18 -hydroxyoctadec- 9 -enoic, 9, 10, 18 -trihydroxyoctadecanoic and octadec- 9 -enoic acids as the major components. The differences in the relative amounts of these acids in the suberin samples and {{the impact on the}} potential exploitation of the different industrial by-products are discussed.

Suberin is {{the main component of}} cork but {{little is known about the}} molecular processes underlying suberin biosynthesis. We screened a Quercus suber bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library for the presence of relevant genes for suberin biosynthesis through high-density BAC filters hybridizations and we validated hybridization positive clones by Colony PCR. We analyzed BAC-end sequences (BESs) to characterize the structure and <b>composition</b> of the <b>cork</b> oak genome. And we hybridized BAC DNA with mitotic cork oak chromosomes to obtain a cytogenetic map of Q. suber. Finally, we analyzed expression profiles of candidate genes of cork samples from cork oaks with different cork qualities, using quantitative real-time PCR. We identified several genes involved in suberin biosynthesis pathways. BESs analysis showed high identity with coding regions and suggest the existence of conserved regions within the Fagacea family. We found strong evidence that the genes Cyp 86 A 1 and GDSL involved in lipid suberin biosynthesis pathway are closely located in the genome. However, we did not succeed in mapping genes of interest in the cork oak genome and we did not find any relation between the genes relative expression and cork qualityThe work was partially supported by a grant from the Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT), project SuberGene (PTDC/AGR-GPL/ 101785 / 2008, Genomics of Cork Formation: an integrated approach of cork qualit...|$|R
30|$|A cased {{borehole}} observatory, the Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kit (CORK), was deployed {{during the}} ODP Leg 195 at Hole 1200 C on the SCS (Shipboard Sci. Party 2002; Wheat et al. 2008). When the observatory seal was opened on 20 March 2003, 2  years after its installation, over-pressurized fluids {{discharged from the}} CORK outlet pipe (this fluid {{is referred to as}} the ‘CORK fluid’ hereafter) at a flow rate of ~[*] 0.2  L/s. The endmember chemical <b>composition</b> of the <b>CORK</b> fluid, estimated from two fluid samples diluted with entrained ambient seawater, was generally similar to those from the porewater samples from deeper zones of the ODP core (Wheat et al. 2008). Although the deep porewater samples obtained during the ODP Leg 195 in 2001 contained abundant sulfate and negligible sulfide, sulfide was present in the highly alkaline (pH  12.4) CORK fluid. This difference implies that partial reduction of sulfate to sulfide could occur within the SCS mud volcano before the formation fluid discharged through the cased borehole (Wheat et al. 2008). Discharge from the open borehole continued for 37  days, until the observatory was resealed on 28 April 2003. During the 2003 campaign, however, no gas-tight fluid sampling was conducted despite gas species such as H 2, CO, CH 4, and other hydrocarbons are key chemical clues for investigating both abiotic organic synthesis and microbiological habitability/function in an active serpentinite mud volcano.|$|R
40|$|The use of soil {{construction}} {{dates back}} to the beginning of our civilization. In the South of Portugal there is still a large number of buildings with rammed earth walls, but this technology has been falling into disuse since the middle of last century. The earth construction is highly sustainable since earth is a local material and is 100 % reusable. The buildings with rammed earth walls have a high thermal inertia which, given the climate characteristics Portugal, enjoys its thermal behavior. However, it is desirable that the thermal conductivity of the rammed earth were lower. Environmental concerns related to energy consumption associated with comfort in housing and construction, transportation and application of materials used in construction, has led us to seek new solutions in building typologies on earth. Considering these aspects and aiming to improve the energy efficiency in buildings with rammed earth walls, this paper presents the results of tests performed in laboratory to characterize phisical properties of several compositions containing soil and expanded granulated <b>cork.</b> <b>Compositions</b> were considered soil and expanded granulated cork having the following percentages of expanded granulated cork, 0 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 % and 25 %. In order to characterize the different compositions from the point of view of mechanical and thermal performance, cubes were produced with 10 centimeters edge and assayed in order to calculate its compression resistance and its thermal conductivity. The results showed that the use of this type of building typologies on earth with the incorporation of expanded granulated cork allows to increase your performance by making it possible to adapt this typology needs of today, including the demands of the Portuguese legislation. The results of this research can be applied, with the appropriate adaptations, both in buildings in rammed earth and in buildings in adobe...|$|R
