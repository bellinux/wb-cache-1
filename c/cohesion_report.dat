40|$|Trends in {{regional}} disparities {{have been a}} major issue {{in regional}} science for many decades and knowledge of ways to overcome such disparities has great importance for regional policy-making. Strong initial differences between regions affect the capacity of each region to grow and their ability to respond to challenges imposed externally, for instance globalisation and growing international competition and trade (Cuadrado-Roura, 2001). Initial differences can relate {{to a wide variety of}} factors, for instance the availability of human resources, the accessibility of a region and the presence of advanced production services. A factor that gets increasing attention is the city system. Flourishing regions can often count on a large, well-accessible and internationally known city or regional clusters of cities. Concentration of support to dynamic growth poles would be an engine for growth of the whole country (or regions) through regional spillovers (Perroux 1955 and Kaldor 1970) Particularly also in regional and spatial policies addressing regional disparities attention is paid to the city system. It has been suggested that polycentric development can be instrumental to reducing regional disparities, see for instance in the European Spatial Development Perspective (CEC, 1999) and the Second <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Report</b> (CEC, 2001). In the Third <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Report</b> the main emphasis is territorial cohesion, which is placed on an equal footing as economic and social cohesion in the (unratified) Constitutional Treaty. Within the discussion on territorial cohesion polycentricity gets much emphasis (Faludi, 2005). Also many European countries pursue a polycentric development, often addressing the dominance of their prime city to diminish regional disparities. Apparently, policy makers assume a strong relationship between the urban system and the persistence of regional disparities. However, this assumption lacks empirical justification. The aim of this paper is to test the hypothesis that a polycentric city system leads to less regional disparities. The paper presents measures of the extent of polycentricity of the national urban systems of 26 European countries. This data is linked with calculations of regional disparities within these 26 countries. Are countries with a relatively polycentric urban system characterised by less regional disparities than more monocentric countries? And, what are the consequences of our findings for regional development policies...|$|E

40|$|Up to {{the start}} of the present {{economic}} crisis (2008), Europe was characterized by a clear trend of convergence in the GDP level of European countries, which was able to counterbalance the opposite trend in intra-national disparities that took place in many countries – namely those with a more recent accession to the Union. The economic downturn of the last years, however, has brought this process of convergence to a halt, mainly as a consequence of the tight austerity policies imposed to many southern European countries. This evidence, recognized by the European Union in the last <b>Cohesion</b> <b>Report</b> (“the crisis has reversed the process of convergence of regional GDP per head and unemployment within the EU”) brought to the fore the relevance of macroeconomic policies in regional development. Therefore in this paper, with the help of a newly built macroeconomic and regional forecasting model (MASST), the future of regional convergence / divergence in the EU is explored through four scenarios: a baseline one, recognizing the clear break of the crisis and three exploratory scenarios, depicting in a consistent way three different “territorial” strategies: supporting large metropolises vs. cities of second and third rank, vs. peripheral and lagging regions. Interestingly enough, the “cities” scenario proves to be at the same time the most cohesive and the most expansionary, shedding some doubts on the traditional equity/efficiency trade-off through an intermediate strategy based on the exploitation of a diffused territorial capital. Overall, diverging regional processes are forecasted from now to 2030...|$|E

40|$|Many {{multiplayer}} games feature teams, {{and whether}} they are pitted against each other or against the game itself {{it seems likely that}} the way these teams bond will affect the players' experience. What are the factors that influence the experience of being a team member in a game? To what extent can the game designer manipulate the cohesion of the teams by changing the game design? How does the satisfaction of the player with their team relate to their feeling of cohesion? How does cohesion differ between tabletop and online games? These issues become particularly important where the group dynamic is central to the desired outcome of the game e. g. educational games aiming to place the players in specific social situations. Four studies were conducted on four similar simulation games (two tabletop, two online) used for teaching in International Development Studies. These games explore farming in sub-Saharan Africa and require 12 - 30 players to play in small groups. The group dynamics are important for the learning outcomes. Similar groups of participants (all students of International Development Studies) played one game each. Each group played for 3 hours before completing a questionnaire about their experience and wrapping up with a full-group reflective discussion. Results from the two tabletop games suggested that, as expected, altering the rules of the game manipulated levels of team cohesion. However, the lack of significant result from the two online games suggests that careful design is required to achieve the same outcomes in the online environment. This suggests that seemingly small changes between tabletop and online implementations may impact the game play experience in unanticipated ways. The team <b>cohesion</b> <b>reported</b> by the players was found to correlate strongly with the team member satisfaction levels of the players. The gender composition of the teams was shown to have a large impact on both team cohesion and team member satisfaction: having one or more females in the group significantly increased both measures...|$|R

Unemployment represents the reverse of the medal, a concept and a measure at the intersection of many dimensions. If “traditionally ” its history is concurrent with free market/ market economy functioning out of full employment mode, expressing socio-economic phenomenon, complex and with a large spectrum of interpretations. The spatial dimension of the unemployment is treated relatively recently by new regional theories, focused on its: geographical/spatial concentration [Alonso-Villar O. and Del R o C (2008) ], agglomeration, returns and spatial unemployment disparities [Suedekum J. (2004) ] with aspects of dynamic [Martin R. (1997) ], persistence, factors, regional policy rethinking [Chisholm M. (1976) ], convergence/divergence of regional disparities [Marshall (1920), Krugman (1991) and Krugman/Venables (1995)), etc]. Overman and Puga (2002) bring empirical evidences regarding the spatial effects of „Unemployment clusters across European regions and countries”.

The interest to measure the intraregional unemployment clusters is based on [Goschin, Roman, Ileanu, 2008] characteristic of the current state and dynamics of regional disparities in Romania descried as “low amplitude of both inter-regional and intra-regional disparities”, with the nuance that, “the intraregional disparities are much higher than the inter-regional disparities. ”...|$|E
40|$|The European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP) (1999) and the Third Report on Economic and Social Cohesion A New Partnership for Cohesion (2004) have firmly {{established}} {{the central role}} of spatial planning and spatial development strategies in achieving the fundamental objectives of economic and social cohesion, conservation of natural resources and cultural heritage, and more balanced competitiveness of the EU territory. The concept of territorial cohesion features prominently in the draft Constitution and in the <b>Cohesion</b> <b>report</b> where it is recognised as a concept that goes beyond the notion of economic and social cohesion. In policy terms the objective of territorial cohesion is defined as helping to achieve a more balanced development by reducing existing disparities, preventing territorial imbalances and by promoting greater coherence between both sectoral policies that have spatial impacts and regional policy. Territorial cohesion also seeks to improve territorial integration and to encourage cooperation between regions. Promoting higher levels of interaction and cooperation between rural and urban areas is a major challenge for policies and strategies that seek to promote higher levels of territorial cohesion. This paper commences with an overview of the different types of interactions between urban and rural areas that have been identified in research on European spatial planning. It will be followed by a summary urban-rural typology map of the recently enlarged EU which will be complemented by some additional typologies that are relevant to future debates on territorial cohesion in the EU. The second part of the paper considers the changes that have occurred in rural-urban relations in Ireland since the early 1990 s against a background of exceptionally high rates of economic growth and an economic context that is recognised as the most open in the world. This will be followed by an outline of the processes involved in preparing the National Spatial Strategy and an assessment of the key concepts that underpin the approach to promoting balanced regional development which explicitly includes an objective of reducing rural-urban disparities.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of 2010, European Commission has launched the new strategic framework for Europe, which {{is now known as}} the "Europe 2020 Strategy". This new strategy has been set as the successor of the so called "Lisbon-Gothenburg Strategy" which was set in early ' 00 as the strategy for Europe in the 21 st century. Actually the two strategies have a lot in common. The main driving forces of Europe still remain the same and some rearrangement in the EU-wide strategic targets has been made. Of course the economic crisis that has emerged forced for a new priority that was set in the "EU 2020 " strategy, but the main targeting still encompasses the three corners of the well known sustainability triangle, namely economy, environment and society. The setting of a new strategy arises some questions. Why does Europe need a new development strategy? Was the old strategy successful or not? Was every country in Europe adapted in the old strategy properly? Where there any problems in the implementation of the old strategy? What was the overall outcome of the old strategy in EU Level, in each Member State and in the regions of Europe? Is the new strategy better adjusted to cope with the development problems in European, national and regional level? Furthermore, European Commission has already asked MS to comply with the specifications of the "Europe 2020 Strategy" in the planning and implementation of the Cohesion Policy's programs in the following years (for the remaining of the 2007 - 2013 period and especially for the 2014 - 2020 period).

40|$|The {{improved}} interoperability {{and business}} agility of software systems based on Service- Oriented Architecture (SOA) {{has created an}} increased demand for the reengineering and migration of legacy software systems. The wide range of current migration techniques for legacy systems implemented in different technologies does not address important aspects of service granularity, which affects service reusability, governance, maintainability and <b>cohesion.</b> This <b>report</b> provides {{an introduction to the}} field and discusses the key issues. Following this, a literature review of practical SOA approaches for building distributed systems is presented. A novel framework for the effective identification of the key services in legacy code is then presented, based on defining the right services using standardized modelling languages (UML and BPMN). This framework provides effective guidelines for determining the optimal service granularity over a wide range of possible service types. Finally, an outline plan for the future PhD research is presented together with the overall conclusion...|$|R
