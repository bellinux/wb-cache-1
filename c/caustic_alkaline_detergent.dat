The objective of this study was to evaluate the analytical sensitivity of legislation-described tests and nonspecific microbial inhibition tests, and to investigate the effect of such substances on microbial growth inhibition and the persistence of detectable residues after 24 / 48 h of refrigeration. Batches of raw milk, free from any contaminant, were divided into aliquots and mixed with different concentrations of formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, chlorine, chlorinated <b>alkaline</b> <b>detergent,</b> or sodium hydroxide. The analytical sensitivity of the official tests was 0. 005 %, 0. 003 %, and 0. 013 % for formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, and hypochlorite, respectively. Chlorine and chlorinated <b>alkaline</b> <b>detergent</b> were not detected by regulatory tests. In the tests for neutralizing substances, sodium hydroxide could not be detected when acidity was accurately neutralized. The yogurt culture test gave results similar to those obtained by official tests for the detection of specific substances.

40|$|In {{the milk}} industry, the {{production}} {{must be stopped}} daily in order to clean the process equipment from deposits that are formed at the inside surface when the products are heat treated. This leads reduced production time since no products can be treated when the equipment are being cleaned. The heat treatment of milk products is necessary {{to ensure that the}} product is safe to consume. When heat treating the milk, certain compounds in the milk become unstable and form a deposit called fouling inside the heating equipment. This fouling layer reduces the heat transfer from the heat equipment to the product that is supposed to be heat treated. In order to remove the fouling deposit cleaning with first alkaline and then acidic detergent are used. It can take up to a few hours before the equipment is cleaned depending on the degree of fouling. The aim of this master’s thesis is to develop a laboratory method for measuring cleaning efficiency of UHT fouling by using cleaning detergents at different temperatures and concentrations. The method was created by looking on how a Cleaning-In-Place process is performed and imitates these steps at a laboratory level, by performing experiments on storage, drying, size and separation of fouling. The cleaning method was evaluated according to repeatability and ability to distinguish cleaning effects of the different cleaning liquids. A cleaning method for dissolution of UHT fouling was achieved where it was possible to detect trends of degree of dissolved fouling when different temperature and concentration of cleaning liquids were used in the sodium hydroxide step. The repeatability of the cleaning method was sufficient to be able to detect the cleaning trends. The cleaning effect trials showed that higher temperature and concentration leads to more fouling dissolved. It was also seen that with higher concentration of <b>alkaline</b> <b>detergent</b> a lower temperature could be used to achieve a similar cleaning compared to lower concentration of <b>alkaline</b> <b>detergent...</b>|$|R

This paper analyzes the NOx removal effectiveness {{of two different}} types of photocatalytic concrete surface layers incorporating nano-TiO 2 particles. Both types of surfaces are examined before and after being subjected to dust accumulation and oil impregnation.

The results show that the high NOx removal capacity of the spray-coated samples is partially maintained even after a high concentration of dust accumulation.

The HEPA-filtered air and any accumulated particulates on the spacecraft, ground support equipment, and floor of the humidity-controlled, desiccated clean room surfaces provide low quantities of nutrients to inhabiting microbes (Venkateswaran et al. 2001). Particulate materials from spacecraft surfaces within HEPA-filtered environments showed a low incidence of spores and cultivable microbial populations (Ghosh et al. 2010; La Duc et al. 2004, 2007). Upon examination using state-of-the art molecular microbial approaches an equal representation of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microbial populations were revealed, most of them were viable but yet to be cultivated (La Duc et al. 2003, 2009; Vaishampayan et al. 2010; Venkateswaran et al. 2001, 2012).
