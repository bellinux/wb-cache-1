40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationships}} between an increase in tree cover area (i. e., natural and planted-tree land covers) and changes <b>in</b> forest <b>carbon</b> storage and the potential of a landscape to provide habitat for native floristic biodiversity. Four areas experiencing an increase in tree cover were analyzed. We developed a metric estimating the potential to support native biodiversity based on tree cover type (plantation or natural forests) and the landscape pattern of natural and anthropogenic land covers. We used published estimates for forest and plantation carbon stocks for each region. Focus regions in northwestern Costa Rica, northern Vietnam, southern Chile and highland Ecuador all showed an increase in tree cover area of 390 %, 260 %, 123 % and 418 %, respectively. Landscapes experiencing increases in natural secondary forest also experienced an increase <b>in</b> <b>carbon</b> stored above and below ground, and in the potential to support native floristic biodiversity. Study landscapes in Chile and Ecuador experiencing an expansion of exotic plantations saw their carbon stock decrease along with their potential to support native floristic biodiversity. This study shows that an increase in forest area does not necessarily imply an increased provision of ecosystem services when landscapes are reforesting with monoculture plantations of exotic tree species. Changes in the support of native biodiversity and the <b>carbon</b> stored <b>in</b> <b>pulp</b> rotation plantations, along with other ecosystem services, should be fully considered before implementing reforestation projects...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to assess the}} {{feasibility}} of <b>carbon</b> capture <b>in</b> Finnish Kraft <b>pulp</b> mills. The feasibilities of thirteen different technology options were evaluated based on their technical maturity, capture potential and estimated break-even price for emission allowance including biogenic emissions. Also the role of pulp and paper industry in climate change mitigation was discussed. The study was conducted by comparing oxy-fuel combustion cases modelled with Balas software and a fuel switch option calculated based on mass and energy balances with results from previous studies. The technical maturity was evaluated based on previous studies and existing commercial activity. The break-even prices from literature were recalculated under the same assumptions for investment costs, commodity costs and supporting policies. Two price estimates were calculated: one including supporting policies and possibly available revenue and another excluding them. The capture potential was estimated using a reference mill scaled to the pulp production rate of 1200 ADt/d. Part of the technologies require large structural changes and were considered available only if the mill is rebuilt. Thus the capture potential in the reference mill was scaled up based on either the capture potential in mills to be rebuilt by 2030 or the capture potential <b>in</b> all Finnish <b>pulp</b> mills. The relevant capture potential was calculated based on the production capacities and the estimated age distribution of the chemical recovery sections <b>in</b> Finnish <b>pulp</b> mills. The results from this thesis were subjected to qualitative and numerical sensitivity analyses. <b>Carbon</b> capture <b>in</b> <b>pulp</b> mills seems feasible only if other revenues than CCS supporting policies are available. These revenues could include by-products like biofuels, higher energy efficiency or increased pulp production. The cases of lignin separation and black liquor gasification to transportation fuels were most cost efficient, but the capture potentials were limited to 1. 45 Mt(CO 2) /a and 0. 82 Mt(CO 2) /a, respectively. Small scale carbon capture for utilization could be achieved with pre-calcination, as the break-even price was only around 4. 5 - 7. 3 €/t(CO 2). Large scale implementation of <b>carbon</b> capture <b>in</b> the Finnish <b>pulp</b> mills with monoethanolamine (MEA) absorption had a capture potential of up to 12 Mt(CO 2) /a, but the break-even price was around 70 - 80 €/t(CO 2) excluding transportation and storage costs. Moreover, barriers in transportation and storage and in the lack of incentives for bio-CCS remain. In addition to CCS, the pulp and paper industry could mitigate the climate change by increasing the amount of carbon based products, sustainable forestry practices and investments in forestation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Anaerobic Batch Treatment of <b>Carbon</b> Dioxide <b>in</b> <b>Pulp</b> and Paper Effluent Xuejiao Jiang. Concordia University, 2013 The {{increasing}} concentration {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2), the most dominant component of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere, has been of growing concern for many years. Since {{the beginning of the}} industrial revolution, atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased dramatically due to human activities. Many methods have been applied to reduce atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, including capture, sequestration, and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. However, these methods have proved to be not efficient or economical. The pulp and paper industry is highly pollution and energy intensive. The pulp and paper manufacturing process contributes significant amounts of pollutants that are released to the environment. The Kraft wastewater from the pulp and paper industry has high COD levels, ranging from 1000 mg/L to 33600 mg/L, and feasible to be treated by anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion has been applied in this study. In this method, CO 2 is converted to methane as a biogas during the biological treatment of industrial pulp and paper wastewater. The final step of anaerobic digestion is to use CO 2 and hydrogen or acetic acid to produce methane. In order to know the feasibility of CO 2 removal by this method, a series of batch tests on pulp and paper wastewater were performed. To determine the optimum conditions, the impact of different pH values (6. 5, 7. 0, 7. 5) and temperatures (20, 30, 35 ºC) on the efficiency of CO 2 and COD removal and methane production was investigated. The efficiency of CO 2 removal was found to be 66 - 90...|$|R

50|$|Musselwhite mine uses a gold cyanidation and CIP (<b>carbon</b> <b>in</b> <b>pulp)</b> {{extraction}} process. Ore {{is extracted}} via a blast hole process and moved via {{a series of}} scoop-trams and underground dump trucks to one of 2 rockbreakers, either on the surface or at a 400 meter level. The ore then travels once through a jaw crusher and {{through a series of}} conveyor belts and countinously along a cone crusher rock sizing circuit. When the ore reaches a specific size it is transported to the mill building where the ore passes once through a rod mill and multiple times through a ball mill until the slurry is ground to approximately 10 µm. The slurry is then thickened, exposed to a cyanide treatment to extract it from the ore and into the solution, absorbed from the solution with activated carbon, rinsed off the carbon, passed through an electrowinning process and finally melted in a furnace and poured into 25 kg bars. The leftover tailings are passed though an INCO/SO2 cyanide destruction process. The remaining tailings are sent though a final thickening stage and are pumped into the tailings pond composed of approximately 85% solids and very little cyanide. Twice a year the excess water is drained off the tailings pond where it flows naturally through a series of polishing ponds and a freshwater marsh. By the time the runoff reaches the natural watershed system the cyanide content is drastically reduced and poses no environmental or safety hazard. The total recovery of this process is approximately 96%. Electrical power is proved by a 115 kV running from Ear Falls to Pickle Lake and a private line from there to the site. However due to the reasonably low voltage of a line that length the losses are quite high, the site only has access to about 19 kV, stalling further development plans such as a mine shaft. Additional power as required or {{in the event of an}} outage is provided by a series of large diesel generators on site.|$|E

40|$|Six MaMADS-box genes {{have been}} cloned from the banana fruit {{cultivar}} Grand Nain. The similarity of these genes to tomato LeRIN {{is low and}} neither MaMADS 2 nor MaMADS 1 complement the tomato rin mutation. Nevertheless, the expression patterns, specifically in fruit and the induction during ripening {{and in response to}} ethylene and 1 -MCP, suggest that some of these genes may participate in ripening. MaMADS 1, 2, and 3, are highly expressed in fruit only, while the others are expressed in fruit as well as in other organs. Moreover, the suites of MaMADS-box genes and their temporal expression differ <b>in</b> peel and <b>pulp</b> during ripening. <b>In</b> the <b>pulp,</b> the increase <b>in</b> MaMADS 2, 3, 4, and 5 expression preceded an increase in ethylene production, but coincides with the CO 2 peak. However, MaMADS 1 expression <b>in</b> <b>pulp</b> coincided with ethylene production, but a massive increase in its expression occurred late during ripening, together with a second wave in the expression of MaMADS 2, 3, and 4. In the peel, on the other hand, an increase in expression of MaMADS 1, 3, and to a lesser degree also of MaMADS 4 and 2 coincided with an increase in ethylene production. Except MaMADS 3, which was induced by ethylene <b>in</b> <b>pulp</b> and peel, only MaMADS 4, and 5 <b>in</b> <b>pulp</b> and MaMADS 1 in peel were induced by ethylene. 1 -MCP applied {{at the onset of the}} increase in ethylene production, increased the levels of MaMADS 4 and MaMADS 1 <b>in</b> <b>pulp,</b> while it decreased MaMADS 1, 3, 4, and 5 in peel, suggesting that MaMADS 4 and MaMADS 1 are negatively controlled by ethylene at the onset of ethylene production only <b>in</b> <b>pulp.</b> Only MaMADS 2 is neither induced by ethylene nor by 1 -MCP, and it is expressed mainly <b>in</b> <b>pulp.</b> Our results suggest that two independent ripening programs are employed <b>in</b> <b>pulp</b> and peel which involve the activation of mainly MaMADS 2, 4, and 5 and later on also MaMADS 1 <b>in</b> <b>pulp,</b> and mainly MaMADS 1, and 3 in peel.

40|$|Abstract: Gold ore is {{processed}} by all-sliming cyanidation CIP (<b>carbon</b> <b>in</b> <b>pulp)</b> at {{a gold mine}} in Gansu province of China. The leaching residue (tailing) Au grade is about 0. 52 g/t, which is much valuable to be recovered. Mineralogical analysis shows {{that the loss of}} gold in leaching residue is mainly organic carbon adsorption gold and inclusion gold, accounting for 45. 55 % and 54. 45 % respectively. The inclusion gold is mostly wrapped by gangue and metallic mineral separately, accounting for 35. 56 % and 18. 89 %. Excluding the gold in gangue, both the gold adsorbed by organic carbon and wrapped in metallic mineral could be recycled by flotation process. Study has been carried out for recovering gold in cyanide residue by solely column flotation apparatus. During the semi-industrial test, B and E type sparger were adopted in flotation columns to evaluate their influence on process performance. To further improve metallurgy technology the ultrasonic device was introduced into flotation column tank. The results showed that ultrasonic pretreatment is negative influence, and the E type sparger is better than B type sparger. The concentrate Au grade is up to 10. 14 g/t, and 34. 3 % of Au lost in tailing was recovered while feed grade being 0. 52 g/t. The column flotation process was proven being a proper way to recycle gold from the tailing of all-sliming cyanidation CIP...|$|E
40|$|Using {{iron and}} sulphur {{oxidising}} bacteria to catalyse {{the breakdown of}} sulphides that host the gold is an important biological method for the pretreatment of refractory gold ores. Following this biological treatment, a combination of chemical and physical methods is used for leaching (such as the cyanide process) and concentration (such as <b>carbon</b> <b>in</b> <b>pulp</b> or electrowinning) of the gold. Although these methods are well accepted by industry, they harbour limitations in the processing of low grade refractory ores and regulatory agency/public acceptance of cyanide use. Thus, it is beneficial for industry to develop environmentally friendly, as well as cost efficient, leaching and concentration techniques {{that are based on}} micro-organisms. This may soon be possible by adapting the results of recent multidisciplinary research, which has shown that micro-organisms are capable of driving a biogeochemical cycle of gold dispersion, transport and re-concentration in the supergene environment. The indigenous microbiota in biologically active soil microcosms from a number of Australian sites are capable of solubilising up to 80 wt-% of the gold contained in soils and deeper regolith materials. Studies using molecular microbial techniques have shown that a metallophilic bacterium, Cupriavidus metallidurans, is present in biofilms on gold grains from a number of Australian sites. Cupriavidus metallidurans is capable of actively accumulating gold from solution and therefore contributes to the formation of secondary gold grains and nuggets. Identifying the biochemical and physiological pathways that lead to the dispersion and accumulation of gold in regolith and quantifying the reaction kinetics of these processes may thus lead to the development of industrial bio-processing capacities for gold containing ores.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development and}} application of a dynamic model of gold adsorption onto activated carbon in gold processing. The primary aim of the model is to investigate different carbon management strategies of the <b>Carbon</b> <b>in</b> <b>Pulp</b> (CIP) process. This model is based on simple film-diffusion mass transfer and the Freundlich isotherm to describe the equilibrium between the gold in solution and gold adsorbed onto carbon. A major limitation {{in the development of}} a dynamic model is the availability of accurate plant data that tracks the dynamic behaviour of the plant. This limitation is overcome by using a pilot scale CIP gold processing plant to obtain such data. All operating parameters of this pilot plant can be manipulated and controlled to a greater degree than that of a full scale plant. This enables a greater amount of operating data to be obtained and utilised. Two independent experiments were performed to build the model. A series of equilibrium tests were performed to obtain parameter values for the Freundlich isotherm, and results from an experimental run of the CIP pilot plant were used to obtain other model parameter values. The model was then verified via another independent experiment. The results show that for a given set of operating conditions, the simulated predictions were in good agreement with the CIP pilot plant experimental data. The model was then used to optimise the operations of the pilot plant. The evaluation of the plant optimisation simulations was based on an objective function developed to quantitatively compare different simulated conditions. This objective function was derived from the revenue and costs of the CIP plant. The objective function costings developed for this work were compared with published data and were found to be within the published range. This objective function can be used to evaluate the performance of any CIP plant from a small scale laboratory plant to a full scale gold plant. The model, along with its objective function, was used to investigate different carbon management strategies and to determine the most cost effective approach. A total of 17 different carbon management strategies were investigated. An additional two experimental runs were performed on the CIP pilot plant to verify the simulation model and objective function developed. Finally an application of the simulation model is discussed. The model was used to generate plant data to develop an operational classification model of the CIP process using machine learning algorithms. This application can then be used as part of an online diagnosis tool...|$|E
