[...] "Watching Avatar, I felt sort of the same as when I saw Star Wars in 1977," [...] he said, adding that like Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the film [...] "employs a new {{generation}} of special effects" [...] and it [...] "is not simply a sensational entertainment, although it is that.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis belongs {{to the area of}} {{computer}} graphics, particularly, to the domain of graphics modelling. This thesis presents experiments in graphics modelling, namely in the application of graphics modelling principles to virtual reality (VR), with an interaction approach that is typical to VR systems. Our approach takes advantage of novel graphics primitives that take the form of sets of vertices, of non-standard approaches to interface construction with the use of controls integrated into the 3 D environment and also of the advantages that the widget technologies are offering. A number of information visualisation, interaction and manipulation options have been adapted to our case, to provide a 3 D <b>character</b> <b>editing</b> virtual environment that is easy to use, aimed at novice users and beyond. The resulting system is an implementation based on the Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML), which means we are using a visualisation tool that {{is at the same time}} the target environment for the resulting 3 D characters. This leaves room for experimentations in 3 D visualisation and interaction techniques, a field that currently lacks in widely accepted standards, specifications or recommendations...|$|E

40|$|In April and May of 2008, {{there was}} a {{fascinating}} discussion on the Virginia Woolf list-serve regarding the complicated effects of Woolf 2 ̆ 7 s lines. 2 ̆ 2 There she was 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 There she sat. 2 ̆ 2 Like the many Woolfians who responded, I 2 ̆ 7 ve been beguilded by these epiphanic bombs or blossoms of three words that serve central structural and thematic functions in Woolf 2 ̆ 7 s fiction. Their appearances have a basic structure: through free in-direct discourse, a narrator conveys {{the point of view}} of a character who is engaged in reading the signs of another <b>character,</b> <b>editing,</b> interpreting, and projecting those signs in a series of readings that re-imagine the other. This process culminates in a suspended moment when the character, transfixed, paradoxically finally 2 ̆ 2 sees 2 ̆ 2 the other. It is in this moment that the narrator, through the character 2 ̆ 7 s vision, conveys the duality of the reading process—these statements of three words (2 ̆ 2 There she was 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 There she sat 2 ̆ 2) point simultaneously to a fixing of meaning or pinning of personality and the impossibility of intimately knowing the other or of formulating the self neatly sprawling on a pin. And it is this tension—between the lure of knowing and capturing the other and the endless play that the indeterimancy of the self and the signifier entails—that Woolf captures in her three words, words that in turn transfix us, her readers...|$|E

40|$|In many {{database}} applications involving string data, it {{is common}} to have near neighbor queries (asking for strings that are similar to a query string) or nearest neighbor queries (asking for strings that are most similar to a query string). The similarity between strings is defined in terms of a distance function determined by the application domain. The most popular string distance measures are based on (a weighted) count of (i) <b>character</b> <b>edit</b> or (ii) block edit operations to transform one string into the other. Examples include the Levenshtein edit distance and the recently introduced compression distance. The main goal in this paper is to develop efficient near(est) neighbor search tools that work for both <b>character</b> and block <b>edit</b> distances. Our premise is that distance-based indexing methods, which are originally designed for metric distances can be modified for string distance measures, provided that they form almost metrics. We show that several distance measures, such as the compression distance and weighted <b>character</b> <b>edit</b> distance are almost metrics. In order to analyze the performance of distance based indexing methods (in particular VP trees) for strings, we then develop a model based on distribution of pairwise distances. Based on this model we show how to modify VP trees to improve their performance on string data, providing tradeoffs between search time and space. We test our theoretical results on synthetic data sets and protein strings. ...|$|R

50|$|Funny {{animals in}} comic strips often follow a {{particular}} convention in conveying thoughts: instead of verbalizing as humans would with speech balloons, funny animals instead use thought balloons to convey messages. This tactic {{allows for the}} relationship between human and animal to be ambiguous, as it may not be clear if the human can understand what the animal is thinking. The aforementioned Snoopy and Garfield are famous for this type of thought-speech. When the Peanuts specials were adapted for television, producers opted to make Snoopy mute, just as a normal dog would be, and act out his thoughts in pantomime. The ambiguous relation between Garfield and his owner Jon Arbuckle inspired a number of derivative works, among them being Garfield Minus Garfield, a collection of strips with the title <b>character</b> <b>edited</b> out and Arbuckle effectively speaking to himself.|$|R
