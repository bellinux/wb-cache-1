50|$|Macpherson {{was born}} Eleanor Nancy Gow in Killara, New South Wales in 1964, the {{daughter}} of entrepreneur and sound engineer Peter Gow, {{a former president of}} a Sydney rugby league team, the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, and Frances Gow, a nurse. Macpherson's parents divorced when she was 10 years old, and she moved with her mother and two siblings. Her mother later remarried, and a <b>clerical</b> <b>mistake</b> in registering at her new school meant that her surname was changed from Gow to Macpherson (her stepfather's surname).|$|E
5000|$|Recorded as O'Keenan {{and more}} usually Keenan, {{this is an}} Irish surname. Found mainly in the Ulster and {{northern}} counties of Fermanagh and Monaghan, it originates from the ancient pre 10th century Gaelic name O' Cianain meaning [...] "The descendant of the faithful one" [...] or similar. It {{may not have been}} entirely coincidence that the clan was famous throughout the Medieval Period for producing both high-ranking members of the church, and early historians, in several cases the same thing. The first recorded scribe was Adam O' Caianain, who was also the canon of Lisgool in Fermanagh. He is mentioned in the annals known as the [...] "Four Masters" [...] as being the historian to the famous Maguires of County Fermanagh. It is said that in 1659 in Petty's Census of Ireland that the spelling was found as MacKeenan, but if so this spelling is now completely extinct and research suggests that the original recording may have been a <b>clerical</b> <b>mistake.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{discrepancy}} {{resulted from}} what officials have called a clerical {{error in the}} transmittal of the text between the Houses. After the bill was filed in the House of Representatives and voted on, it {{was sent to the}} Senate. In that chamber, the bill was considered again. Several provisions were stricken due to a point of order under section 313 of the Congressional Budget Act (commonly known as the [...] "Byrd Rule" [...] after its author, Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-WV)). This necessitated return to the House to again be voted on. In preparing the text for return to the House, certain numbers related to payments in the Medicare program for certain durable medical equipment were changed by mistake. The House voted on a resolution concurring in this Senate amendment (with the legitimately stricken provisions), but the text presented contained the erroneous number changes. The approval resolution was passed in the House and the text of the bill with errors in it was returned to the Senate for the preparation to be presented to the President. There, the mistaken numbers were corrected prior to the transmittal to the President. The bill as originally intended was signed into law, but some dispute remains as to whether both Houses of Congress passed the same legislation. The <b>clerical</b> <b>mistake</b> has given rise to several legal challenges to the law, generally from those who disagree with the policies included therein.|$|E
40|$|Post-normalization {{checking}} of microarrays rarely occurs, {{despite the}} problems that using unreliable data for inference can cause. This paper considers {{a number of different}} ways to check microarrays after normalization for a variety of potential problems. Four types of problem with microarray data that these checks can identify are: <b>clerical</b> <b>mistakes,</b> array-wide hybridization problems, problems with normalization and mishandling problems. Any of these can seriously affect the results of any analysis. The three main techniques used to identify these problems are dimension reduction techniques, false array plots and correlograms. None of the techniques are computationally very intensive and all can be carried out in the R statistical package. Once discovered, problems can either be rectified or excluded from the data. ...|$|R
40|$|Studies hIre {{revealed}} significant problems in correctly scoring ambiguous verbal responses to test {{items on the}} Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R). This study evaluated the effectiveness of an instructional design procedure developed to reduce examiner scoring errors on the WISC-R. Data concerning frequent sources of error on the WISC-R were obtained from 14 clinical psychology graduate students (pre-intervention group) enrolled in an Individual Intelligence Testing course. Remedial strategies were developed to clarify response categories and minimize errors due to carelessness. Strategies were used with 9 post-intervention students who took the course the following fall term. Pre- and post-intervention students completed the course and administered the WISC-R several times. A total of 98 pre-intervention and 63 post-intervention protocols were analyzed {{to determine the number}} and type of errors. Compared to the pre-intervention group, the post-intervention group had significantly fewer errors, with careless mathematical and <b>clerical</b> <b>mistakes</b> almost eliminated. Students continued to make mistakes, showing no improvement trith practice in test administrations. A certain amount of difficulty in scoring may be inherent in the WISC-R test manual, and it may be advisable to incorporate examiner scoring errors into the WISC-R standard error of measurement.

40|$|Design {{of a new}} {{curriculum}} and revision of an existing curriculum are considered as tedious tasks for academics. This process requires considerable amount of man hours from subject matter experts in several areas. In this paper, we present a human-assisted semi-automated solution for the design and revision of curricula for degree programmes. We postulate the curriculum design and revision as an ontology modelling process. The solution has been developed as a plug-in, named as Onto CD, for the popular ontological modelling environment, Protege. A curriculum developer can customize OntoCD by introducing benchmark domain ontology of a certain degree, and loading a skeleton curriculum for the intended degree programme. Alternatively, the domain ontology {{can be used to}} design a curriculum on the visual interface provided, and proceed to improve it. The developer can also use OntoCD to load a known curriculum and to do the modification to align with the benchmark domain ontology. The power of OntoCD exemplifies during the process of editing and improving a curriculum. In this process, OntoCD handles many tasks including the credit balancing with core and elective modules, guidance to choose elective modules to meet local needs and resolving name confusions of modules by ensuring an identity of a degree within the respective area. At this stage, OntoCD has been informally tested by designing a Computer Science degree curriculum according to benchmark domain ontology of ACM/IEEE guidelines for computing degrees. The results show that Onto CD guides the developer by reducing the burden due to <b>clerical</b> <b>mistakes,</b> oversights and negligence of some aspects in the development process...|$|R
