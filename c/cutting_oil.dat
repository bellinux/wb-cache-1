The Invasion of French Indochina on 22 September 1940 (which by then {{was controlled by}} the collaborating government of Vichy France), and Japan's ongoing bloody conflict with China, put a severe strain on American-Japanese relations. On 26 July 1940, the United States had passed the Export Control Act, <b>cutting</b> <b>oil,</b> iron and steel exports to Japan. This containment policy was Washington's warning to Japan that any further military expansion would result in further sanctions. However, such US moves were interpreted by Japan's militaristic leaders as signals {{that they needed to}} take radical measures to improve the Empire's situation, thereby driving Japan closer to Germany.|$|E
25|$|Cutting fluid {{is a type}} of coolant and {{lubricant}} {{designed specifically}} for metalworking processes, such as machining and stamping. There are various kinds of cutting fluids, which include oils, oil-water emulsions, pastes, gels, aerosols (mists), and air or other gases. They may be made from petroleum distillates, animal fats, plant oils, water and air, or other raw ingredients. Depending on context and on which type of cutting fluid is being considered, it may be referred to as cutting fluid, <b>cutting</b> <b>oil,</b> cutting compound, coolant, or lubricant.|$|E

25|$|Thread forming is {{performed}} using a , or , which closely resembles a cutting tap without the flutes. There are lobes periodically spaced around the tap that actually do the thread forming as the tap is advanced into a properly sized hole. Since the tap does not produce chips, {{there is no need}} to periodically back out the tap to clear away chips, which, in a cutting tap, can jam and break the tap. Thus thread forming is particularly suited to tapping blind holes, which are tougher to tap with a cutting tap due to the chip build-up in the hole. Note that the tap drill size differs from that used for a cutting tap and that an accurate hole size is required because a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of <b>cutting</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E

40|$|The hazard of scrotal cancer from <b>cutting</b> <b>oils</b> {{was first}} {{recognized}} in the 1950 s, and led to various control measures including the introduction of solvent refined oils, use of splash guards, provision of protective clothing and washing facilities and education of workers to encourage early detection and treatment of tumours. To assess how effective these controls have been, we have analyzed occupational mortality from scrotal cancer in England and Wales during 1979 - 80 and 1982 - 90. Over this 11 -year period 85 deaths were attributed to the disease in men aged 20 - 74. This represents a reduction in mortality from the 1960 s. Significantly elevated proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were found in press and machine tool setters (PMR 1, 678, five deaths), centre lathe turners (PMR 1, 099, three deaths) and machine tool operators (PMR 303, eight deaths), {{but all of the}} metal machinists who died of scrotal cancer had been born before 1930, and could have worked with <b>cutting</b> <b>oils</b> before controls were introduced.
