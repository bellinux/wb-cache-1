5|$|In late 2002, The Strategic Planning Committee of Stonehill College {{determined}} that the then-current mascot, the chieftain, was disrespectful to American Indians and decided {{that it would be}} <b>changed.</b> <b>After</b> discussion, the mascot was changed to the Skyhawk in 2005.|$|E
5|$|According to the United Kingdom Census 2011, the {{population}} of the Southcote area was 8,548, of which 48% were male and 52% female. This is an increase of 58 residents compared to the 2001 census. Censuses before this cannot be compared, as the ward boundaries (and therefore population) <b>changed</b> <b>after</b> the 1991 census.|$|E

5|$|At first Citroën {{decided not}} to offer their new {{automatic}} EGS6 gearbox version in the UK due to the unfavourable exchange rate and costs, although this <b>changed</b> <b>after</b> a small number were privately imported for insurance classification purposes.

5|$|Augvald {{had set up}} {{his base}} in the {{north-eastern}} part of Karmøy, but {{the western part of}} the island was still ruled by another king, Ferking. The two were not enemies at first, but that <b>changed</b> <b>after</b> Augvald and his men attended a midwinter sacrificial banquet in Ferkingstad. What started as a friendly visit turned sour, and Augvald returned home with his men, leaving his daughters held captive at Ferkingstad.|$|E
5|$|Jojo the Klownzilla, {{the colossal}} clown who {{appears at the}} end of the film, was {{originally}} intended to be created using stop-motion animation, but was instead portrayed by Charles Chiodo in a rubber suit. In the film's original finale, Deputy Dave dies in the explosion of the clowns' ship, but this was <b>changed</b> <b>after</b> audiences in test screenings desired a more upbeat ending.|$|E

5|$|Queer Eye is an American reality {{television}} series that premiered {{on the cable}} television network Bravo during July 2003. The program's original name Queer Eye for the Straight Guy was <b>changed</b> <b>after</b> the third season to generalize the scope of its content. The series was created by executive producers David Collins and Michael Williams along with their producing partner David Metzler; it was produced by their production company, Scout Productions.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the matches}} were <b>changed</b> <b>after</b> {{they were first}} announced, as several wrestlers left the WWF shortly before the event. Critics have praised the main event and the tag team match that was won by Savage and Perfect. Although the {{remaining}} bouts have received low ratings, critics have felt that those two matches made the event worth watching.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Bow Street <b>changed</b> <b>after</b> {{the construction of}} the nearby Covent Garden Theatre {{to the west of the}} street in 1809. Only a short run of buildings from No.35 to Russell Street remain on their original sites; the rest having been given up for large buildings. During the 19th century, Bow Street was a de facto extension of Covent Garden and its associated markets, selling then-exotic fruit and vegetables.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} <b>changed</b> <b>after</b> {{the outbreak}} of World War II. Poland was invaded in September 1939. Great Britain became involved, {{and a series of}} German victories in Denmark, Norway, and the Netherlands during spring 1940 were alarming. Britain was clearly threatened and its leadership discussed the possibility of an alliance with the Soviet Union. Under the circumstances, direct British confrontation over the Baltic issue was difficult.|$|E
5|$|A {{strain of}} truly domesticated red foxes was {{introduced}} by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly <b>changed.</b> <b>After</b> about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.|$|E
5|$|David Gilbertson, {{a former}} {{assistant}} inspector {{who had worked for}} the Home Office formulating policing policy, told The New York Times that the British police used to act with the sanction of the public, but that tactics had <b>changed</b> <b>after</b> a series of violent assaults on officers in the 1990s. Now dressing in military-style uniforms and equipped with anti-stab vests, extendable metal batons and clubs that turn into handcuffs, an entire generation of officers has come to regard the public as the enemy, the newspaper said.|$|E

5|$|Hill was {{qualifying}} for a 1997 event at Sonoma when his car suffered severe vibration {{as he crossed}} the finish line. The car went out of control and was completely destroyed. Hill had two broken toes and a shoulder contusion, which were not serious injuries. The run had been fast enough to make Hill the fastest qualifier, and Hill wanted to race his backup car in the first round on the day after the accident. The NHRA had a rule that the car used for qualifying had {{to be used in the}} event, so the sanctioning body did not allow him to compete. The rule was <b>changed</b> <b>after</b> the event to allow racers to race on race day even if they do not use the same car.|$|E
5|$|In {{paintings}} and engravings of the 18th and 19th centuries, Pugs usually appear with longer legs and noses than today, and sometimes with cropped ears. The modern Pug's appearance probably <b>changed</b> <b>after</b> 1860 {{when a new}} wave of Pugs were imported directly from China. These Pugs had shorter legs and the modern-style Pug nose. The British aristocrat Lady Brassey is credited with making black Pugs fashionable after she brought some back from China in 1886. Ear cropping was made illegal in 1895.|$|E
5|$|Many Portuguese colonials {{were not}} typical {{settlers}} in Mozambique. While most European communities in Africa {{at the time}} - {{with the possible exception}} of Afrikaners - were established from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, some white families and institutions in those territories still administered by Portugal had been entrenched for generations. Loss of their privileged status and fears of FRELIMO reprisal resulted in an exodus of up to 200,000 white civilians at independence (in Europe they were popularly known as retornados). Cities, towns and villages saw their Portuguese names <b>changed</b> <b>after</b> independence - Lourenço Marques to Maputo, Vila Pery to Chimoio, Vila Cabral to Lichinga, or Vila Junqueiro to Gurúè.|$|E

5|$|On January 30, 2017, the Boy Scouts of America {{announced}} that transgender boys {{would be allowed}} to enroll in boys-only programs, effective immediately. Previously, the sex listed on an applicant's birth certificate determined eligibility for these programs; going forward, the decision would be based on the gender listed on the application. Joe Maldonado became the first openly transgender boy to join the Scouts on February 7, 2017. In 2016, he was rejected from the Boy Scouts for being transgender, but the policy was <b>changed</b> <b>after</b> his story became nationally known.|$|E
5|$|Once {{regarded}} as plants constituting the class Schizomycetes, bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes. Unlike cells {{of animals and}} other eukaryotes, bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles. Although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes, the scientific classification <b>changed</b> <b>after</b> the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved from an ancient common ancestor. These evolutionary domains are called Bacteria and Archaea.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1808, the Portuguese {{were the}} only European people to settle Brazil in {{significant}} numbers. Although British, Germans, Italians and Spanish had previously immigrated to Brazil, they had only done so as {{a small number of}} individuals or in very small groups. These earliest non-Portuguese settlers did not {{have a significant impact on}} the culture of Portugal's Brazilian colony. The situation <b>changed</b> <b>after</b> 1808 when King JoãoVI began to encourage immigration from European countries outside Portugal.|$|E
