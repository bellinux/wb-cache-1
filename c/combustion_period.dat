Although modern petrol engines may have compression ratios typically between 9:1 and 12:1, a petrol-paraffin engine requires a lower compression ratio of 8:1 or less, to avoid pre-ignition of the fuel-air mixture which would cause damage from engine knocking. Most existing petrol aero-engines have low compression ratios, around 8:1 or 9:1, making a dual-fuel conversions viable.|$|E

However, implementation of this technique can be confounded by cyclic variability. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to define experimental metrics that describe the SACI process and to demonstrate the use of these metrics for identifying the source(s) of cyclic variability during the SACI process. This study focused on a light load condition (7 mg/cycle, 200 kPa i. m. e. p.), where spray-guided direct fuel injection with spark ignition and an exhaust-rebreathing strategy was employed to achieve flame propagation, which led to compression ignition. This study employed a combination of measurements including pressure-based heat-release analysis, spark-discharge voltage/current measurements, and cycle-resolved combustion imaging. Based on these measurements, four distinct <b>combustion</b> <b>periods</b> were identified; namely, the spark discharge, the early kernel growth (EKG), flame propagation, and the compression ignition periods. Metrics were defined to characterize each period and used to identify the contribution of each period to the cyclic variability of the main heat release. For the light load condition studied here, the EKG period had the largest effect on the crank angle (CA) position of 50 per cent mass burned, CA 50. The spark-discharge event may affect CA 50 indirectly through its influence on EKG. However, this could not be definitively assessed here since the camera was incapable of recording both the spark-discharge event and the flame images during cycles of the same tests...|$|R

After the national hypersonic research and technology programs in Germany and France (German Hypersonic Technology Program and French Research and Technology Program for Advanced Hypersonic Propulsion - PREPHA (1), the mastery of high-speed airbreathing propulsion technologies {{is not sufficient to}} allow the development of an operational vehicle. Therefore, ONERA and DLR decided to join in a common research program that investigates an airbreathing propulsion system operating from Mach 4 to Mach 8. The general goal of this project, named JAPHAR (Joint Airbreathing Propulsion for Hypersonic Application Research), is to demonstrate the feasibility of the dual mode ramjet and to develop a methodology for on-ground and in-flight performance demonstration. Concurrently with engine studies, the project includes conceptional design studies to define an experimental vehicle for dual mode ramjet testing between Mach 4 and Mach 8 and to find a methodology to evaluate its in-flight performances. Furthermore, this vehicle is the leading configuration for the different component studies within the project and it is used for the global synthesis of the obtained results. In {{order to be able to}} obtain results at different Mach numbers between Mach 4 and 8, even if the scramjet thrust should be lower than expected, the vehicle is boosted up to Ma*= 8 and then performs a few <b>combustion</b> <b>periods</b> on a decelerating trajectory. In order to be representative for a full scale scramjet operation, the engine height was chosen equal to 100 mm. This results in a global vehicle length of 11. 5 m and a weight of about 2 tons. The vehicle is not reusable. During the first design cycle ONERA provided a first definition of the vehicle engine and the associated propulsion dataset. Using this engine ONERA studied a preliminary definition of a vehicle based on the wing-body concept (Fig. 1). Based on the given propulsion geometry DLR additionally defined a waverider configuration (Fig. 2). Using the experiences of former waverider studies (2), (3) which showed that waveriders are excellent designs for TSTO missions the aim is to reduce the required thrust for a horizontal flight at M*= 8.

Lean and rich fuel/air mixtures for both methane and propane were tested to investigate various preferential diffusion conditions. As a result, electrically induced instability showing cracked structure on the flame surface could be observed.

For hypothesis formulation, we turned to multi-year modern flux measurements to look for triggers of C loss or lower accumulation rates (via net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) or net ecosystem production) in periods or places in which (1) water tables are more variable or are drawn down to aerate more peat, and (2) active layer thickness is deeper, resulting in greater ratio of thawed: frozen substrates. Keeping in mind that significant or persistent changes in seasonal factors could trigger (1) or (2), we tested for times or areas in which NECB was reduced. For hypothesis testing, we then used two approaches. The first approach compared total inventories of bomb-enriched Cs- 137, unsupported Pb- 210, and bomb enriched C- 14 and used controls sites for establishing regional variations in fallout. The second approach uses Cs- 137 and Pb- 210 chronologies and then uses soil C- 14 data over those chronologies to estimate turnover times of bulk soil C. Preliminarily, C turnover in soils was fastest in well drained landscapes with deepest active layers and was slowest in mature forest stands with thinner active layers. This result is consistent with hypotheses that water tables and active layers play a leading role in governing soil carbon fate in high-latitude regions...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two or three decades {{increasing}} and ever accelerating trends of environmental degradation have been recorded and widely reported in a number of international scientific works. As is often claimed, this situation is particularly attributable to globalization and the widespread increase of economic activities. The recognition that FDI represents a relevant part of globalization raises various concerns. However, its environmental implications are not easy to identify and this gives rise to complex arguments and contradictory views. This work aims to give a modest contribution to the scientific reflection on the FDI-environment relationship and is structured as follows. The first chapter introduces the main aspects of FDI and identifies the links characterizing its relationship with the natural environment. The second chapter provides a literature review. The third chapter is entirely dedicated to the empirical analyses which attempt to go beyond what is done in the literature. In fact, in addition to a major interest in trade, a particular orientation to develop analyses on national aggregated data is generally observed. Our work, instead - and this might be perceived as its original contribution - investigates the mentioned relationship at the level of specific activity sectors. Through the use of the econometric technique of panel data, a purpose-built dataset is investigated to mainly observe the effect that FDI inflowing in the "agriculture and fishing", the "manufacturing" and the "transport and communication" sectors of the OECD countries generates on the level of some considered pollutants. More specifically, the analysis of the "agriculture and fishing" sector focuses on both the FDI-CH 4 (over the period 1990 - 2005) and FDI-CO 2 from the sectoral fuel <b>combustion</b> (over the <b>period</b> 1981 - 2005) relationships. The "manufacturing" and "transport and communication" sectors are analysed only on the basis of the FDI-CO 2 from the sectoral fuel combustion relationship (over the period 1981 - 2005). Two final chapters are respectively dedicated to the concluding discussion and policy considerations of the work. The results of our analyses, expressed in terms of cumulative effects, show that when the investigation of the "agriculture and fishing" sector is made to observe the CH 4 -FDI relationship, the coefficient results equal to + 0. 0427 + 0. 0018 FDI, this showing the increase of Methane emission when FDI grows by 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Cycle-resolved {{measurements}} of the fuel concentration near a spark plug in both a commercial spark-ignition piston engine and a commercial rotary engine were performed. An in situ laser infrared (IR) absorption method was developed using a spark plug sensor and a 3. 392 -μm He–Ne laser as the light source. This wavelength coincided with the absorption line of hydrocarbons. The newly developed IR spark plug sensor had a higher signal-to-noise ratio than its previous version due to the optimization of its quartz lens and two optical fibers. The new sensor provided quantitative cycle-resolved fuel concentration measurements around the spark plug with a high temporal resolution. At lean preset air/fuel (A/F) ratios, fuel was mixed with the surrounding air gradually near the spark plug. Strong mixture inhomogeneities were measured during the compression stroke; the magnitude of these inhomogeneities decreased throughout the compression stroke. There was {{a strong correlation between}} the fuel concentration measured with the spark plug sensor and the combustion characteristics during the initial <b>combustion</b> <b>period,</b> which occurred faster when conditions were slightly richer than stoichiometric near the spark plug. The indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) was slightly related to the A/F ratio near the spark plug. It was possible to measure the cycle-resolved A/F ratio near the spark plug and investigate its cycle-to-cycle fluctuations t...|$|E
