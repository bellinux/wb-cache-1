5000|$|Arvind Sharma, a {{professor}} of comparative religion, notes that caste has been used synonymously to refer to both varna and jati but that [...] "serious Indologists now observe considerable caution in this respect" [...] because, while related, the concepts {{are considered to be}} distinct. In this he agrees with the Indologist Arthur Basham, who noted that the Portuguese colonists of India used casta to describe ... tribes, clans or families. The name stuck and became the usual word for the Hindu social group. In attempting to account for the remarkable proliferation of castes in 18th- and 19th-century India, authorities credulously accepted the traditional view that by a process of intermarriage and subdivision the 3,000 or more castes of modern India had evolved from the four primitive classes, and the term 'caste' was applied indiscriminately to both varna or class, and jati or caste proper. This is a false terminology; castes rise and fall in the social scale, and old castes die out and new ones are formed, but the four great classes are stable. There are never more or less than four and for over 2,000 years their order of precedence has not altered." [...] The sociologist Andre Beteille notes that, while varna mainly played the role of caste in classical Hindu literature, it is jati that plays that role in present times. Varna represents a <b>closed</b> <b>collection</b> of social orders whereas jati is entirely open-ended, thought of as a [...] "natural kind whose members share a common substance."

40|$|Revelation, Truth, Canon, and Interpretation {{are four}} {{fundamental}} issues in pre-Nicene Christianity. This dissertation seeks to examine these in Justin Martyr's Dialogue with Trypho. The INTRODUCTION indicates {{the impetus for}} this investigation and reviews the pertinent secondary sources and their contributions to these issues. A review of Justin's life and his extant writings is also included. CHAPTER ONE examines Justin's concept of Revelation. Justin's conversion to Christianity {{is placed in the}} context of his Middle Platonism. From this context we learn that, as a philosopher, Justin's primary goal was knowledge of God. The case Justin builds throughout the Dialogue is that the true philosophy, the incarnate Logos, is witnessed to only in the Prophets and the Apostles. The incarnate Logos is seen as the culmination in God's plan for salvation and is thus revelation. CHAPTER TWO examines Justin's concept of truth. From the genre that Justin chose and his understanding of the attainment of truth as the goal of a philosopher, we see that Justin saw truth as located in the Logos. Justin is differentiated from the Hebrew and the Platonic concepts of truth and continues the line of argument established in the NT writers. Truth is fulfilled and found in Jesus Christ, through his pre-existence and his incarnation. CHAPTER THREE examines Justin's concept of canon. Justin did not conceive of a <b>closed</b> <b>collection</b> of Christian writings. While his references to Memoirs are important, they should not be seen as implying a <b>closed</b> <b>collection</b> of Christian writings. Concerns about this belong to an age later than Justin's. CHAPTER FOUR highlights the foundations upon which Justin interpreted the Hebrew scriptures. The determining factor here is the new Covenant which was Christ himself. Because of Christ, the old Law has become obsolete and a new Law has replaced it. This is why the Jew and the Christian can use the same scripture yet end up with differing interpretations. APPENDIX ONE is a listing of Gospel quotations and allusions in the Dialogue. APPENDIX TWO is a review of the issue of the primary audience of the Dialogue. Here arguments are offered for an audience that is primarily Jewish...|$|E

It starts with an introduction of theories of legitimacy and democratic deficit related to the European Union, in connection with which the European citizens' initiative came into existence, and also the theory of participatory democracy, within the scope of which the European citizens' initiative can be placed. The thesis then specifies three criteria in order to examine the effectiveness of this tool. In the first criterion, it analyses the criteria set for the European citizens' initiative in the above-mentioned Regulation in comparison with similar tools on national levels, and with regard to other academic analyses on this topic. In the second criterion, the thesis examines citizens who use European citizens' initiative {{on the basis of a}} questionnaire among representatives and substitutes of selected initiatives.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe the kinetics of urinary recovery and to evaluate the effects of postmucosal factors on urinary recovery of 5 intravenously administered saccharides. Ten cats received an isotonic sugar solution containing lactulose, rhamnose, xylose, methylglucose, and sucrose intravenously. These sugars were selected because of their prior use for intestinal permeability and mucosal function testing in humans and dogs. Urethral catheterization with a <b>closed</b> <b>collection</b> system was used for collection of cumulative urine samples prior to and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h after administration of the sugar solution. High-pressure anion exchange liquid chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection was used to measure the concentrations of each sugar in the urine and calculate urinary recovery. Twenty-four hour cumulative urinary recovery for each sugar from the cats, was lower than expected compared to dogs and humans. All 5 sugars had the highest percentage of urinary recovery during the first 2 h after administration. Mean sugar elimination rate constants and half-lives ranged from 0. 268 /h for methylglucose to 0. 415 /h for lactulose and 1. 67 h for lactulose to 2. 59 h for methylglucose, respectively. Metabolism and incomplete urine collection are possible reasons for lower cumulative urinary recoveries of these 5 sugars in cats compared with dogs. Although these 5 sugars are not ideal marker molecules, they may still be useful for intestinal permeability and mucosal function testing in cats...|$|E
