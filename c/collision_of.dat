5|$|The <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 was {{fortuitously}} timed for astronomers, coming just a {{few months}} after Servicing Mission 1 had restored Hubble's optical performance. Hubble images of the planet were sharper than any taken since the passage of Voyager 2 in 1979, and were crucial in studying the dynamics of the <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> a comet with Jupiter, an event believed to occur once every few centuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher density – often triggered by compression of clouds by radiation from massive stars, expanding bubbles in the interstellar medium, the <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> different molecular clouds, or the <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> galaxies (as in a starburst galaxy). When a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for Jeans instability, it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force.|$|E

Following the in-flight <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> Flight 706, the FAA and the US Military agreed to cut down on VFR flights and operate instead under IFR. This transition would require military aircraft to file flight plans and obey civilian air traffic controllers.|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes using <b>collisions</b> <b>of</b> Pareto random {{variables}} in traffic analysis and in generating fictitious network traffic that follows various Pareto distributions. Pareto distributions are {{commonly found in}} network statistics, but the distributions may be truncated or overlapping, thus {{making it hard to}} estimate their sample parameters. Therefore, this paper investigates methods of computing parameters <b>of</b> binned <b>collisions</b> <b>of</b> Pareto {{random variables}}. This paper explores an indicator variable approach to analyzing <b>collisions</b> <b>of</b> Pareto random variables. These collisions are initially modeled by the Birthday problem or paradox and then they are extended to understand independence <b>of</b> <b>collisions.</b> This paper’s use of indicator variables simplifies the calculation of higher moments for binned <b>collisions</b> <b>of</b> Pareto random variables. ...|$|R
50|$|In conduction, {{the heat}} flow is within {{and through the}} body itself. In contrast, in heat {{transfer}} by thermal radiation, the transfer is often between bodies, which may be separated spatially. Also possible is transfer of heat {{by a combination of}} conduction and thermal radiation. In convection, internal energy is carried between bodies by a moving material carrier. In solids, conduction is mediated by the combination <b>of</b> vibrations and <b>collisions</b> <b>of</b> molecules, <b>of</b> propagation and <b>collisions</b> <b>of</b> phonons, and <b>of</b> diffusion and <b>collisions</b> <b>of</b> free electrons. In gases and liquids, conduction is due to the <b>collisions</b> and diffusion <b>of</b> molecules during their random motion. Photons in this context do not collide with one another, and so heat transport by electromagnetic radiation is conceptually distinct from heat conduction by microscopic diffusion and <b>collisions</b> <b>of</b> material particles and phonons. But the distinction is often not easily observed, unless the material is semi-transparent.|$|R

5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth.

5|$|Accidents {{involving}} {{human error}} include American Airlines Flight 965, which {{crashed into a}} mountain in Buga, Colombia, on December 20, 1995, killing 151 passengers and eight crew members with four survivors, and the mid-air <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> DHL Flight 611 near Überlingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, on July 1, 2002, {{with the loss of}} two on board plus 69 on a Bashkirian Airlines Tupolev Tu-154. The American Airlines Flight 965 crash was blamed on navigational errors by the crew, while the <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> DHL Flight 611 involved air traffic control errors. Accidents attributed to pilot disorientation due to improperly maintained instruments include Birgenair Flight 301 on February 6, 1996, in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, with the loss of all 189 passengers and crew, and Aeroperú Flight 603 on October 2, 1996, off the coast of Pasamayo, Peru, with the loss of all 70 on board. In the Birgenair accident, investigators found that the aircraft had been stored without the necessary covers for its pitot tube sensors, thus allowing insects and debris to collect within, while in the Aeroperú accident, protective tape covering static vent sensors had not been removed.|$|E
5|$|At Bremerton, on {{the east}} side of the Olympics, the {{measured}} rotations are less, and within the statistical error bounds of being zero; while further north, near Port Townsend, the rotation is slightly counter-clockwise. On Vancouver Island the paleorotations are counter-clockwise, and other evidence shows that the tip of the island has been bent, presumably as a result of the <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> Siletzia. The northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula also shows counter-clockwise rotation, of around 45 degrees. This raises a question of how much of the arcuate shape of the Crescent Formation is due to loss of material from the center after uplift by the Olympic Mountains, and how much reflects oroclinal bending.|$|E

5|$|Cameras on the Galileo {{spacecraft}} observed {{fragments of}} Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 between 16 and 22 July 1994 as they collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere {{at a speed}} of approximately 60kilometres per second. This was the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> solar system objects. While the impacts {{took place on the}} side of Jupiter hidden from Earth, Galileo, then at a distance of 1.6AU from the planet, was able to see the impacts as they occurred. Its instruments detected a fireball that reached a peak temperature of about 24,000K, compared to the typical Jovian cloudtop temperature of about 130K (−143°C), with the plume from the fireball reaching a height of over 3,000km.|$|E
5|$|Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 (formally {{designated}} D/1993F2) was a comet {{that broke}} apart in July 1992 and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> Solar System objects.

5|$|Formation of {{the carbon}} atomic nucleus {{requires}} a nearly simultaneous triple <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> alpha particles (helium nuclei) within {{the core of a}} giant or supergiant star which is known as the triple-alpha process, as the products of further nuclear fusion reactions of helium with hydrogen or another helium nucleus produce lithium-5 and beryllium-8 respectively, both of which are highly unstable and decay almost instantly back into smaller nuclei. This happens in conditions of temperatures over 100 megakelvin and helium concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of the early universe prohibited, and therefore no significant carbon was created during the Big Bang.|$|E

5|$|Impacts {{are thought}} to be a regular (if {{currently}} infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk meteor and the impact feature Meteor Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, therefore, is not complete, and may still pose a threat to life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight {{to collide with}} enemies. The elevation of an enemy {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls toward the bottom of the screen, which a player can collect for points. An egg that sits on a platform long enough will hatch into a new knight; if the player does not pick him up, he will gain a new mount and must be defeated again.|$|E

5|$|Some comets meet a more {{spectacular}} end – either {{falling into the}} Sun or smashing into a planet or other body.
