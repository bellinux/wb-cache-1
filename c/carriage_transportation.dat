50|$|Carriage use in North America {{came with}} the {{establishment}} of European settlers. Early colonial horse tracks quickly grew into roads especially as the colonists extended their territories southwest. Colonists began using carts as these roads and trading increased between the north and south. Eventually, carriages or coaches were sought to transport goods as well as people. As in Europe, chariots, coaches and/or carriages were a mark of status. The tobacco planters of the South were some of the first Americans to use the carriage as a form of human transportation. As the tobacco farming industry grew in the southern colonies so did the frequency of carriages, coaches and wagons. Upon the turn of the 18th century wheeled vehicle use in the colonies was at an all-time high. Carriages, coaches and wagons were being taxed {{based on the number of}} wheels they had. These taxes were implemented in the South primarily as the South had superior numbers of horses and wheeled vehicles when compared to the North. Europe, however, still used <b>carriage</b> <b>transportation</b> far more often and on a much larger scale than anywhere else in the world.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWeight {{transportation}} is massively present {{in our current}} society and it is characterized by adult populations wearing heavy backpacks, or carrying extra weight in their torso, due to obesity. [1]In military life load carriage is a constant presence, since military personnel is often required to carry their personal supplies and equipment for long distances, facing a lot of biomechanical and postural changes. [1, 2] This load, usually carried in a backpack placed in the torso of military personnel, increases the mass near this area which potentiate the risk of injuries due to falling. [1]Literature indicates several approaches for facilitating load carriage, among them there may be seen: reducing total loads, modifying equipment and improving load distribution. [3] Among these approaches, {{at least two of}} them are directly connected with the design of the load carriage system namely: modifying equipment and improving load distribution. Equipment modifications may reduce strain by allowing pressure and load to be distributed to other body locations and appropriated changes may even lead to lower energy consumption, injury rates and improved performance by military personnel. [3]In order to contribute to this subject, this paper intends to present a review on biomechanical aspects regarding military weight transportation systems so that design contributions may be made upon them.

The new modernization {{was an attempt to}} solve these problems by using a modern split trail carriage of the 122-mm gun M1931. A prototype went through ground trials starting 16 May 1934. The trials lasted until 16 January 1935, then the gun was given to the army for testing. The responses were mostly positive and the gun was officially adopted as 152-mm gun model 1910/34. Because of its maximum elevation angle of 45°, it was sometimes referred to as howitzer. In fact, even the developers initially called the piece 152-mm howitzer model 1932 and later 152-mm howitzer model 1934. The latter name can also be seen in some official documentation.|$|R

In Pakistan, tangas are mainly found in the older parts of cities and towns, and are becoming less popular for utilitarian travel and more popular for pleasure. Tangas have become a traditional feature of weddings and other social functions in Pakistan, as well as in other nations. They are usually pulled by two horses, though some require only one. Others are designed for farm work.

40|$|Equine methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{carriage}} {{entails a}} risk of both equine and zoonotic transmission and infection. In Europe, CC 398, the livestock-associated (LA-) MRSA is highly prevalent in horses and veterinary personnel at equine clinics. The extent of the MRSA reservoir created by healthy horses {{from the general population}} and associated health hazard for their daily caretakers is, however, unknown. This study aimed at screening healthy horse-caretaker couples from a broad range of home farms. At five equine gatherings, 166 couples were selected for MRSA screening in the anterior nares and participation in an epidemiologic survey. All MRSA isolates were subjected to genotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Only 4 humans (2. 4 %) and 2 of their horses (1. 2 %) tested MRSA positive. Within the 2 couples where both partners were positive, man and horse carried isolates belonging to identical, livestock-associated spa types (t 011 and t 2330) and demonstrating equal antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. For all LA-MRSA positive humans (n= 3) and animals (n= 2) regular (in) direct contact with the veterinary sector was reported. A significant association between the horses' <b>carriage</b> status and <b>transportation</b> to an event could not be demonstrated (P= 1. 00). In conclusion, outside equine clinics, the extent of the MRSA reservoir in horses and their caretakers was low. Travel to an equine gathering could not be withheld as a risk factor for equine MRSA carriage, whereas indications were found that contact with veterinary care may predispose both healthy horses and their handlers to carriage.

40|$|Concurrently {{with other}} investigations, the Department of Economics and Commerce in this University during 1937, 1938 and 1939 {{conducted}} {{research into the}} cost structure of Australian industry. The research, Mr. D. L. Anderson, B. Com, prefaced his monograph {{by pointing out that}} the utility of such an investigation was difficult to define before the results of the investigation were known. The same observation may be made of the present study; the results of which can only be said to be indeterminate. Nor can the work done be justified {{on the grounds that it}} constitutes, to quote Anderson, "a first stop in a theoretical analysis which may finally result in same practical result, such as the improvement of economic or technical efficiency. " For example, inductive confirmation of some of the currently hold theories of industrial location' wore sought but little light has been thrown on the applicability of such theories. It was decided to conduct an examination of the effects of shipping costs on specific industries for two reasons. Firstly, the financial history of the State since Federation has emphasised the cost of Bass Strait to the Tasmanian community, 'Being wholly dependent on sea <b>carriage</b> for the <b>transportation</b> of imports and exports, every ship and every freight rate is a factor in the prosperity of the State. Secondly, the survey conducted last year of the gross and net labour absorptive capacity of Tasmanian secondary industries suggested that the ruling level of shipping freight rates was a determining factor so far as output policies and industrial expansion were concerned. However, it may even be that, particularly where production economies are desired, output is expanded in spite of freight costs. For a full understanding of the Tasmanian position it is necessary to realise that not only is Tasmania isolated from the other States, but it is divided into four sections each of which is economically isolated from the others'. Although a very small State the climate and the quality of the soil vary considerably, with the result that each section specialises in a particular branch of primary production. The West is an extensive mining field - its only port is Strahan. The North West Coast produces chiefly oats, peas, potatoes, timber and fat stock and its interstate ports arc Stanley, Burnie, Devonport and Ulverstone. The North and North East produces chiefly wool, grain, hay and fruit, and is served almost wholly by the port of Launceston. The chief primary products of the South are fruit and timber for which the interstate port is Hobart. The exportable output of the secondary industries is also distributed among the four groups of ports. In regard to secondary industry it is hardly necessary to stress the point that the tariff has not succeeded in promoting manufacturing industry in Tasmania. Owing to the absence of a home market, the limited supply of labour and the insular position of the State with the keen mainland competition, it is difficult to anticipate that manufacturing industries on a largo scale are likely to locate in Tasmania. On the other hand, tho present State Government's declared policy of post war industrial development is understood to be yielding results and already a number of now establishments have commenced production. The continuance and extension of this policy will largely depend on the relative bargaining power of Tasmania as against other States anxious to develop industrially. As will be noted in Chapter VIII it must be realised that the term "decentralisation of secondary industry" means one thing to such industrialised states as Victoria and New South Wales and another to the outlying states, particularly Tasmania and Western Australia. Chapter I relates to the affects of the Coasting Trade provisions of the Navigation Act of 1912 - 43. Whether Tasmania is worse off than she would be under free competition in shipping is questionable. Tasmania needs regularity of service more than any other state, and, as she is off the main line of traffic Tasmanian trades are rather in the nature of a diversion and hence more expensive...|$|R
