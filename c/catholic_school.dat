40|$|This article {{reflects}} on the place of multicultural education in <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools.</b> The authors review the history ami development of <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools</b> in order to set a context for examination of the appropriateness of multicultural education. American <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools,</b> like the United States, are constantly evolv-ing. Long a major force on the American educational scene, the steady expansion of <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools</b> was altered dramatically by the wave of refomis ushered in by Vatican 11. Vatican II, which affected {{almost every aspect of}} the life of the Roman Catholic Church and its apostolates (Hastings, 1991), portended the revolu-tion that shook the foundations of American <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools.</b> Two elements which contributed to this fundamental change were a significant decrease in the number of religious teaching in <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools</b> and a marked increase in the number of minority students enrolled in <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools.</b> For example, the dramatic change in the composition of predominantly reli-gious to overwhelmingly lay faculties in <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools</b> directly affecte...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Four {{criteria}} {{that have been}} suggested to evaluate the effects of private schooling and education vouchers are: (1) freedom of choice, (2) productive efficiency, (3) equity, and (4) social cohesion. This study uses these criteria to evaluate some {{of the effects of}} <b>Catholic</b> <b>schooling</b> in the United States. <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools</b> are shown to increase the ability of Catholic families to promote Catholic values and beliefs. That is, <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools</b> increase the ability of Catholic families to provide a faith-based education for their children. The effect of <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools</b> on productive efficiency is mixed. Data from Illinois suggest that private school competition does not improve the quality of public schooling. Further, national data indicate that <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools</b> at best only have modest positive effects on educational outcomes for white students. However, <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools</b> seem to have significant and substantial positive effects on educational outcomes for black and Hispanic students. For this reason, <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools</b> have favorable effects on equity...|$|R

50|$|The {{schools were}} {{originally}} managed by seven sisters from Ireland and aimed {{to assist the}} Maori population and the new settlers. From 1853 to 1875, the provincial governments financed grants for the <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools.</b> The Education Act 1877 however, allowed all schools to be free, compulsory and secular, and therefore disallowing funding of <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools.</b> In the early 1970s, increasing rolls and funding constraints saw <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools</b> accumulating large amounts of debt or being run down. The Government, fearing the state system was unable to cope with an influx of students if the <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools</b> folded, enacted the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975. The Act allowed <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools</b> and other private schools to 'integrate' with the state system, receiving public funding and keeping their Catholic character, in exchange for being subject to the conditions of being a state school, such as having to teach the nationally set curriculum. The first <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools</b> integrated in August 1979, and by 1984, all <b>Catholic</b> <b>schools</b> in New Zealand had integrated.|$|R
