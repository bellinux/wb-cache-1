For traffic control reasons it is usually necessary for an aircraft {{to stay at the}} <b>cleared</b> <b>flight</b> <b>level.</b> On long-haul flights, the pilot may ask air traffic control to climb from one flight level to a higher one.

40|$|International audienceTCAS {{resolution}} advisories generation process during level-off {{situation is}} overviewed and illustrated {{on a real}} situation captured through mode S radar with RA downlink service. It underlines that one common type of resolution advisories is that which is issued when aircraft are expected to level-off 1000 feet apart, and are converging at the same time. These resolution advisories, often subsequently classed as ?operationally unnecessary? from an air traffic control standpoint, can be perceived as disturbing by controllers and by pilots. This issue has been tackled in this paper by proposing a method to prevent RA triggering during level off situation. This method {{is based on the}} setting of the altitude at which the autopilot switches towards the altitude capture mode and on an intrinsic parameter of the autopilot altitude capture mode, namely its natural frequency. It is shown that applying the proposed method to the illustrative example prevents the issuance of resolution advisories when aircraft are expected to level-off 1000 feet apart. The method which is presented is one of the simplest options, and allows altitude capture without triggering resolution advisories for vertical speeds up to 3000 feet/min. Nevertheless, the time needed by the aircraft to capture the <b>cleared</b> <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> is increased. Consequently, future work will focus on improving the time needed to capture the <b>cleared</b> <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> under the constraint to keep positive the distance between the autopilot altitude capture dynamic and the boundary of the RA zone...|$|E

The fully recognizable bodies of the six Japanese passengers who were ejected from the aircraft were found along with the plane's rear cargo hatch, having landed in a turnip field near Saint-Pathus, approximately 15 km south of where the remainder of the plane was found.

50|$|Flight 86 was {{en route}} to Lagos airport at <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> (FL) 240 (approximately 24000 ft altitude). At the same time an {{aircraft}} operated by Triax {{was on its way}} from Lagos to Enugu at FL160. The Lagos Air Traffic Controller cleared the crew of Flight 86 to descend, but erroneously thought that he had earlier <b>cleared</b> <b>Flight</b> 86 to descend to 10000 ft and that it was below the Triax aircraft. The descent from FL240 caused Flight 86 to conflict with the Triax flight at FL160. The traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) sounded an alert but when the crew took evasive action they overcompensated and it rolled too far; the pilots lost control and within sixteen seconds the aircraft was upside down and diving towards the ground at near-Mach 1 speed. The inverted aircraft disintegrated on impact near Imota (Ejirin) at 17:05 local time.|$|R

40|$|International {{audience}} Data {{published by}} Eurocontrol report the traffic growth over summer 2011 {{to be around}} 2 %. In these conditions alleviating delays caused by airspace congestion is, {{and will continue to}} be, critical to the operation of the European air traffic control system. In the origin of delays are several factors, an important one being the congestions. We will focus on congestion in the airspace rather than at airports, both problems can be treated separately. Here we are interested in reducing the en-route congestion and the induced cost, and we study <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> optimization with respect to a given traffic demand and given routes. We typically consider here the total cost due to en-route conflict resolution. With respect to the FLA (<b>Flight</b> <b>Level</b> Assignment) problem, we restrict ourselves to only three possible <b>levels</b> for each <b>flight,</b> called preferred <b>levels</b> (the one in the middle being the most preferred). Despite this restriction, the problem remains highly combinatorial due to the large number of simultaneous flights. We prove formally that the <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> assignment problem is NP-complete in the strong sense even for an airspace with only three <b>flight</b> <b>levels,</b> which makes it hard to solve at optimum even for reduced size instances. The problem becomes rather more difficult when involving the uncertainties in ATM (Air Traffic Management). More precisely, an important question that we raise in this paper is how to include the potential en-route conflicts associated with each aircraft in the <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> assignment model and take into account the uncertainties related to it. All this leads to the robust <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> assignment problem and the associated mathematical model, which is the main focus of this work. </p...|$|R
