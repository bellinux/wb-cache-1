5000|$|One interpretation, {{which is}} {{followed}} by the Boards of Appeal of the EPO, is that an invention is patentable if it provides a new and non-obvious [...] "technical" [...] solution to a technical problem. The problem, and the solution, may be entirely resident within a computer such as a way of making a <b>computer</b> <b>run</b> faster or more efficiently in a novel and inventive way. Alternatively, the problem may be how to make the computer easier to use, such as in T928/03, Konami, Video Game System.|$|E

50|$|Ongoing {{evolution}} of computerized design and control technologies, such as CAD/CAM, CNC, PLC, and others, has limited {{the use of}} jigs in manufacturing, however all the <b>computer</b> <b>run</b> machines need some sort of clamping fixture for production runs. A common example is that a drill jig is not needed to guide the drill bits to the hole centers if it is done on a CNC, since it is Computer Numerically Controlled. However, fixtures are still needed to hold the parts {{in place for the}} operation needed. Jigs are currently needed in many areas of manufacturing but mainly for low-volume production.|$|E

50|$|A {{concern with}} using digital {{fly-by-wire}} systems on the Shuttle was reliability. Considerable research {{went into the}} Shuttle computer system. The Shuttle used five identical redundant IBM 32-bit general purpose computers (GPCs), model AP-101, constituting a type of embedded system. Four <b>computers</b> <b>ran</b> specialized software called the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS). A fifth backup <b>computer</b> <b>ran</b> separate software called the Backup Flight System (BFS). Collectively they were called the Data Processing System (DPS).|$|R

50|$|Virtutech {{was founded}} in 1998 as a {{spin-off}} from the Swedish Institute of Computer Science (SICS), in Stockholm, Sweden. In 2004, the headquarters was moved to San Jose, California, USA. The Stockholm site remains the company's R&D center. The company's main product is Simics software, used by teams of software developers to simulate computer systems. This facilitates the development, testing, and debugging of embedded software that runs devices such as high-end servers, network hardware, aerospace/military vehicles, and automobiles. Virtutech markets products that allow embedded software developers to create virtual models of hardware using an ordinary desktop <b>computer,</b> <b>run</b> specified sets of tests, and walk the programs through each step of execution, both forwards and backwards. See the Simics Wikipedia article {{for more on the}} product.|$|E
5000|$|On May 30, 1978 {{the company}} {{presented}} the simulation of an accidental crash {{of a military}} fighter plane into {{a nuclear power plant}} at a Verein Deutscher Ingenieure (VDI) meeting in Stuttgart. [...] German automobile manufacturers then tested the applicability of several emerging commercial crash simulation codes, including what would become Pam-Crash crash simulation software. As part of this project, the software's initial version simulated the frontal impact of a full passenger car structure, a Volkswagen Polo car model, in a collision with a rigid concrete barrier at 50 km/h, in an overnight <b>computer</b> <b>run.</b> This was the first successful full-car frontal crash simulation ever performed. [...] Finite element simulation provided accurate determination of the structural deformations while rigid body simulation was used during the relatively unimportant deformation and free-flight phases of the simulation.|$|E
50|$|Most {{variants}} of this malware {{will not be}} overtly harmful, as they usually will not steal a user's information (as spyware) nor critically harm a system. However, the software will act to inconvenience the user by frequently displaying popups that prompt the user to pay to register the software in order to remove non-existent viruses. Some variants are more harmful; they display popups whenever the user tries to start an application or even tries to navigate the hard drive, especially after the computer is restarted. It does this by modifying the Windows registry. This can clog the screen with repeated pop-ups, potentially making the computer virtually unusable. It can also disable real antivirus programs to protect itself from removal. Whichever variant infects a computer, MS Antivirus always uses system resources when running, potentially making an infected <b>computer</b> <b>run</b> more slowly than before.|$|E

50|$|A {{computer}} simulation study {{to plan the}} economic development of the Nile was directed by H. A. W. Morrice and W. N. Allan, for the Ministry of Hydro-power of the Republic of the Sudan, during 1955-1957 Morrice was their Hydrological Adviser, and Allan his predecessor. M.P. Barnett directed the software development and computer operations. The calculations were enabled by accurate monthly inflow data collected for 50 years. The underlying principle {{was the use of}} over-year storage, to conserve water from rainy years for use in dry years. Irrigation, navigation and other needs were considered. Each <b>computer</b> <b>run</b> postulated a set of reservoirs and operating equations for the release of water {{as a function of the}} month and the levels upstream. The behavior that would have resulted given the inflow data was modeled. Over 600 models were run. Recommendations were made to the Sudanese authorities. The calculations were run on an IBM 650 computer. Simulation studies to design water resources are discussed further in the article on hydrology transport models, that have been used since the 1980s to analyze water quality.|$|E
50|$|Steve Jobs {{insisted on}} the idea of no fan or air vents, {{in order to make the}} <b>computer</b> <b>run</b> quietly. Jobs would later push this same {{ideology}} onto almost all Apple models he had control of, from the Apple Lisa and Macintosh 128K to the iMac. To allow the computer to dissipate heat, the base of the Apple III was made of heavy cast aluminum, which supposedly acts as a heat sink. One undeniable advantage to the aluminum case was a reduction in RFI (Radio Frequency Interference), a problem which had plagued the Apple II series throughout its history. Unlike the Apple II series, the power supply was mounted - without its own shell - in a compartment separate from the logic board. The decision to use an aluminum shell ultimately led to engineering issues which resulted in the Apple III's reliability problems. The lead time for manufacturing the shells was high, and this had to be done before the motherboard was finalized. Later it was realized that there wasn't enough room on the motherboard for all of the components unless narrow traces were used.|$|E
50|$|As {{machines}} {{became more}} powerful {{the time to}} run programs diminished, and the time to hand off the equipment to the next user became large by comparison. Accounting for and paying for machine usage moved on from checking the wall clock to automatic logging by the <b>computer.</b> <b>Run</b> queues evolved from a literal queue {{of people at the}} door, to a heap of media on a jobs-waiting table, or batches of punch-cards stacked {{one on top of the}} other in the reader, until the machine itself was able to select and sequence which magnetic tape drives processed which tapes. Where program developers had originally had access to run their own jobs on the machine, they were supplanted by dedicated machine operators who looked after the machine and were less and less concerned with implementing tasks manually. When commercially available computer centers were faced with the implications of data lost through tampering or operational errors, equipment vendors were put under pressure to enhance the runtime libraries to prevent misuse of system resources. Automated monitoring was needed not just for CPU usage but for counting pages printed, cards punched, cards read, disk storage used and for signaling when operator intervention was required by jobs such as changing magnetic tapes and paper forms. Security features were added to operating systems to record audit trails of which programs were accessing which files and to prevent access to a production payroll file by an engineering program, for example.|$|E

50|$|WorldBench uses popular desktop {{applications}} to perform realistic tasks, {{making it easier}} to accurately gauge how fast a <b>computer</b> <b>runs</b> applications routinely used, rather than just listing abstract measures of individual components. The application-based tests tell exactly what is neededâ€”how fast the <b>computer</b> <b>runs</b> real applications. WorldBench installs special versions of each application tested, enabling the automated test scripts to perform every test. It also ensures that the software configuration and version are identical for every computer evaluated. The setup program installs the user interface, testing scripts, and all documents necessary to complete the tasks. It also unpacks and installs each application as needed during testing.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} comparing <b>computer</b> <b>run</b> time of building simulation programs. The computing run time of a simulation program depends on several key factors, including the calculation algorithm and modeling capabilities of the program, the run period, the simulation time step, {{the complexity of the}} energy models, the run control settings, and the software and hardware configurations of the computer that is used to make the simulation runs. To demonstrate the approach, simulation runs are performed for several representative DOE- 2. 1 E and EnergyPlus energy models. The <b>computer</b> <b>run</b> time of these energy models are then compared and analyzed...|$|E

30|$|All <b>computer</b> <b>runs</b> made in {{this study}} were {{performed}} using a computer system called Techila PC-Grid [9]; at TUT there are about 400 desktops computers that have been interconnected in a way that allows computing time demanding tasks to be computed 10 â€“ 100 times faster than comparing with one only table computer. Typical road traffic accident data mining LISp-Miner running time was from a few minutes to several hours. With one single <b>computer,</b> the longest <b>runs</b> would have lasted for days, and all in all, <b>computer</b> <b>runs</b> would have lasted for 300 days; by Techila PC-Grid they were done in a few weeks. During that time, Techila PC-Grid checked up billions of fourfold contingency tables. Primary, to keep thinks simple, we wanted to find as simple associations as possible.|$|R
