2500|$|Sandy Creek, {{the stream}} that was dammed to create Lake Wilhelm, was noted in reports made by George Washington during his 1753 trip to Fort LeBoeuf during the French and Indian War. Sandy Creek had a {{recurring}} history of flooding. This {{led to a}} study by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The study began in 1939. Plans were delayed by the start of World War II but the citizens of Mercer County could see the benefit of building a flood <b>control</b> <b>dam</b> on Sandy Creek. The state, county, township and municipal authorities of the surrounding area worked together to push forward the idea of building the dam and recreational facilities in Mercer County. The land was acquired in the late 1960s. Construction on the dam began soon after and was completed in 1971. Maurice K. Goddard State Park was opened to the public in 1972.|$|E

2500|$|Lorentz {{was also}} {{asked by the}} Dutch {{government}} to chair a committee to calculate some {{of the effects of}} the proposed Afsluitdijk (Enclosure Dam) flood <b>control</b> <b>dam</b> on water levels in the Waddenzee. Hydraulic engineering was mainly an empirical science at that time, but the disturbance of the tidal flow caused by the Afsluitdijk was so unprecedented that the empirical rules could not be trusted. Originally Lorentz was only supposed to have a coordinating role in the committee, but it quickly became apparent that Lorentz was the only physicist to have any fundamental traction on the problem. In the period 1918 till 1926, Lorentz invested a large portion of his time in the problem. Lorentz proposed to start from the basic hydrodynamic equations of motion and solve the problem numerically. This was feasible for a [...] "human computer", because of the quasi-one-dimensional nature of the water flow in the Waddenzee. The Afsluitdijk was completed in 1932, and the predictions of Lorentz and his committee turned out to be remarkably accurate.|$|E

Gene expression of inflammatory markers MCP- 1, IL- 1, NOS 3, TGF-β, TNF-α, and VEGF was evaluated by RT-PCR. Results. MCP- 1 was increased in the CFA and DFA groups at two and five months of age, {{as well as in}} DC 5 when compared to CC 5. There was a higher expression of IL- 1 in the CFA 2, DFA 2, and DC 2 groups. There was a decrease in NOS 3 and an increase in TNF-α in DFA 5 in relation to CFA 5. The gene expression of TGF-β increased in cases that had received folic acid at two and five months, and VEGF decreased in the CFA 5 and DFA 5 groups. DC 5 showed increased VEGF expression in comparison with CC 5. Conclusions. Gestational diabetes mellitus and folic acid both change the expression of inflammatory markers, thus demonstrating that the exposure to harmful agents in adulthood has a more severe impact in cases which underwent fetal reprogramming...|$|R

40|$|International audienceEpidemiological {{studies show}} {{a link between}} low birthweight and {{increased}} obesity. In contrast, slow growth during the lactation period reduces obesity risk. This study investigates potential underlying mechanisms. Rats were established as follows: (a) controls (offspring of <b>control</b> <b>dams</b> fed a 20 % protein diet), (b) recuperated animals (offspring of dams fed an isocaloric low-protein (8 %) diet during pregnancy, nursed by <b>control</b> <b>dams)</b> and (c) postnatal low-protein animals (offspring of <b>control</b> <b>dams</b> nursed by low-protein dams). Serum and brains were collected from fed and fasted animals at weaning. Expression of hypothalamic energy balance genes was assessed using in situ hybridisation. Recuperated pups were smaller at birth, but caught up with controls by day 21 and gained more weight than controls between weaning and 12 weeks of age (p< 0. 05). At 21 days they were hypoleptinemic compared to controls in the fed state with generally comparable hypothalamic gene expression. Postnatal low-protein offspring had significantly lower body weight than controls at weaning and 12 weeks of age (p< 0. 001). At 21 days they were hypoglycemic, hypoinsulinemic and hypoleptinemic. Leptin receptor gene expression in the arcuate nucleus was increased in postnatal low-protein animals compared to controls. Consistent with the hypoleptinemia, hypothalamic gene expression for orexigenic neuropeptides, neuropeptide Y and, agouti-related peptide, was increased, and that for anorexigenic neuropeptides, proopiomelanocortin and cocaine-and amphetamine-regulated transcript was decreased.

40|$|Poor {{early growth}} is {{associated}} with Type II diabetes, hypertension and other features of the metabolic syndrome in adulthood. It {{has been suggested that}} this results from the development of a thrifty phenotype by a malnourished fetus. Such a phenotype would predispose the offspring to the development of obesity if born into conditions of over-nutrition. The present study aimed to determine if early nutrition affected subsequent development of obesity. Mice were established as follows: (a) controls (offspring of <b>control</b> <b>dams),</b> (b) recuperated (offspring of dams fed a low-protein diet during pregnancy, but nursed by <b>control</b> <b>dams)</b> and (c) postnatal low-protein (offspring of <b>control</b> <b>dams</b> nursed by low-protein-fed dams). Mice were weaned on to standard laboratory chow or a cafeteria diet. Recuperated offspring, although smaller at birth (P< 0. 01), caught up and exceeded the weight of control offspring by 7 days of age (P< 0. 001). Postnatal low-protein offspring were smaller than controls by 7 days of age (P< 0. 001). Recuperated animals gained more weight than controls when given free access to a highly palatable diet (P< 0. 01). Postnatal low-protein animals showed no additional weight gain when given a highly palatable diet compared with chow-fed litter-mates. These results suggest that the early environment has long-term consequences for weight gain. These programmed responses are powerful enough to block excess weight gain from a highly palatable diet and, thus, have major implications for the drug-free regulation of food intake and obesity. <br/...|$|R
