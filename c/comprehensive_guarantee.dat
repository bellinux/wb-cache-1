Circulant {{preconditioning}} for symmetric Toeplitz linear {{systems is}} well-established; theoretical guarantees of fast convergence for the conjugate gradient method are descriptive of the convergence seen in computations. This {{has led to}} robust and highly efficient solvers based on use of the fast Fourier transform exactly as originally envisaged in Gil Strang’s ‘Proposal for Toeplitz Matrix Calculations ’ (Studies in Applied Mathematics, 74, pp. 171 – 176, 1986.).

Puskesmas is the first grade of health service provider in the JKN era. The utilization rate of puskesmas by the community in Indonesia is still low. Rowosari puskesmas with working region in the majority people located in the middle and lower socioeconomic has a low number of visit. Aim: This study aims to determine the relationship between socioeconomic status of the BPJS participants to the utilization of health care services in Puskesmas. Methodes : This study was an observational study with cross-sectional design. Samples were obtained by consecutive sampling from March to April 2016. The primary data in the form of descriptive data would be presented in tabular form. Then the data was analyzed using chi-square test. Results : The result showed that there is significant relationship between education (p= 0, 017), job (p= 0, 001), income (p= 0, 016), and socioeconomic (p= 0, 013) of the BPJS participants to the utilization of health care services in Puskesmas. Mulivariat analysis using binary logistic regression showed that the significant factor related to the utilization of the health care services in Puskesmas is Job variable (p= 0, 000). Conclusions : There is significant relationship between socioeconomic status of BPJS participants to the utilization of health care services in Puskesmas.

40|$|Does {{your program}} {{do what it}} is {{supposed}} to be doing? Without running the program providing an answer to this question is much harder if the language does not support static type checking. Of course, even if compile-time checks are in place only certain errors will be detected: compilers can only second-guess the programmer???s intention. But, type based techniques go a long way in assisting programmers to detect errors in their computations earlier on. The question if a program behaves correctly is even harder to answer if the program consists of several parts that execute concurrently and need to communicate with each other. Compilers of standard programming languages are typically unable to infer information about how the parts of a concurrent program interact with each other, especially where explicit threading or message passing techniques are used. Hence, correctness guarantees are often conspicuously absent. Concurrency management in an application is a complex problem. However, it is largely orthogonal to the actual computational functionality that a program realises. Because of this orthogonality, the problem can be considered in isolation. The largest possible separation between concurrency and functionality is achieved if a dedicated language is used for concurrency management, i. e. an additional program manages the concurrent execution and interaction of the computational tasks of the original program. Such an approach does not only help programmers to focus on the core functionality and on the exploitation of concurrency independently, it also allows for a specialised analysis mechanism geared towards concurrency-related properties. This dissertation shows how an approach that completely decouples coordination from computation is a very supportive substrate for inferring static guarantees of the correctness of concurrent programs. Programs are described as streaming networks connecting independent components that implement the computations of the program, where the network describes the dependencies and interactions between components. A coordination program only requires an abstract notion of computation inside the components and may therefore be used as a generic and reusable design pattern for coordination. A type-based inference and checking mechanism analyses such streaming networks and provides <b>comprehensive</b> <b>guarantees</b> of the consistency and behaviour of coordination programs. Concrete implementations of components are deliberately left out of the scope of coordination programs: Components may be implemented in an external language, for example C, to provide the desired computational functionality. Based on this separation, a concise semantic framework allows for step-wise interpretation of coordination programs without requiring concrete implementations of their components. The framework also provides clear guidance for the implementation of the language. One such implementation is presented and hands-on examples demonstrate how the language is used in practice...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{boosting}} algorithms in linear regression {{from a new}} perspective: that of modern first-order methods in convex optimization. We show that classic boosting algorithms in linear regression, namely the incremental forward stagewise algorithm (FS_ε) and least squares boosting (LS-Boost(ε)), {{can be viewed as}} subgradient descent to minimize the loss function defined as the maximum absolute correlation between the features and residuals. We also propose a modification of FS_ε that yields an algorithm for the Lasso, and that may be easily extended to an algorithm that computes the Lasso path for different values of the regularization parameter. Furthermore, we show that these new algorithms for the Lasso may also be interpreted as the same master algorithm (subgradient descent), applied to a regularized version of the maximum absolute correlation loss function. We derive novel, <b>comprehensive</b> computational <b>guarantees</b> for several boosting algorithms in linear regression (including LS-Boost(ε) and FS_ε) by using techniques of modern first-order methods in convex optimization. Our computational guarantees inform us about the statistical properties of boosting algorithms.

30|$|Early {{opportunistic}} {{routing protocols}} often focus on establishing source-to-sink shortest paths {{in terms of}} the ETX (expected transmission count) [8], the hop count [18], or the coding efficiency [9]. These works yield good throughput with frequent message exchanges and network state maintenance. Additionally, they do not pay much attention on improving the end-to-end delivery performance [19]. Another kind of opportunistic routings for traditional wireless networks and sensornets, such as EHOR [10], AOR [20], SGOR [21], GeRaf [22], preferentially select the forwarders who are physically nearest to the sink. However, those works depend heavily on the priori knowledge of each node’s position. In particular, they are often inefficient in <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>comprehensive</b> network performance because they might insist on selecting forwarding paths only according to the downstreaming nodes’ position, neglecting the effect of unreliable links on both the throughput and the energy efficiency.|$|R

40|$|Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the {{backbone}} of routing infrastructure in the Internet. In its current form, it is an insecure protocol with potential for propagation of bogus routing information. There have been several high-profiles Internet outages linked to BGP in recent times. Several BGP security proposals have been presented in the literature; however, none has been adopted so far and, as a result, securing BGP remains an unsolved problem to this day. Among existing BGP security proposals, Secure BGP (S-BGP) is considered most comprehensive. However, it presents significant challenges in terms of number of signature verifications and deployment considerations. For it to provide <b>comprehensive</b> security <b>guarantees,</b> it requires that all Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the Internet to adopt the scheme and participate in signature additions and verifications in BGP messages. Among others, these challenges have prevented S-BGP from being deployed today. In this thesis, we present two novel lightweight security protocols, called Credible BGP (C-BGP) and Hybrid Cryptosystem BGP (HC-BGP), which rely on security mechanisms in S-BGP but are designed to address signature verification overhead and deployment challenges associated with S-BGP. We develop original and detailed analytical and simulation models to study performance of our proposals and demonstrate that the proposed schemes promise significant savings in terms of computational overhead and security performance in presence of malicious ASes in the network.

As an important problem in many applications, KNN query has been extensively investigated in the literature. In this paper, we study the problem of processing rank based KNN query against uncertain data. Besides applying the expected rank semantic to compute KNN, we also introduce the median rank which is less sensitive to the outliers. We show both ranking methods satisfy nice top-k properties such as exactk, containment, unique ranking, value invariance, stability and fairfulness. For given query q, IO and CPU efficient algorithms are proposed in the paper to compute KNN based on expected (median) ranks of the uncertain objects. To tackle the correlations of the uncertain objects and high IO cost caused by large number of instances of the uncertain objects, randomized algorithms are proposed to approximately compute KNN with theoretical <b>guarantees.</b> <b>Comprehensive</b> experiments are conducted on both real and synthetic data to demonstrate the efficiency of our techniques.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the development of}} Anglesey’s pioneering scheme of comprehensive education between 1935 and 1974. It scrutinises the contributing factors that permitted Anglesey {{to become the first}} local authority to introduce a fully comprehensive system of secondary education in 1953. The political process behind educational developments is analysed, with particular focus on the relationship between local and central government. Due to the island’s prominent role as a pioneer of comprehensive schooling, this local case study is also positioned within the wider educational context of the time. The broadly chronological approach of the study shows the Local Education Authority’s (LEA) early support of multilateralism, and its successful resistance to the desires of the Board of Education (BoE) throughout the 1930 s and into the 1940 s. The implementation of the pioneering scheme in 1953 demonstrated continuity rather than change. It is emphasised that the exceptional circumstances which existed on Anglesey was the predominant reason why such an experimental scheme was allowed to go ahead. The early introduction of a <b>comprehensive</b> system <b>guaranteed</b> Anglesey a prominent place within the broader educational debate during the 1950 s and 1960 s. The thesis evaluates the significant interest and scrutiny the education system engendered, and the interrelationship between local developments and the wider educational debate. This work reveals how issues were emerging in Anglesey’s comprehensive schools during {{the latter half of the}} 1960 s and the early 1970 s. It analyses how Anglesey’s comprehensive scheme was becoming a cause for concern locally, at the very time that central government expressed its official support for comprehensive schools. Paradoxically, the LEA’s reservations also coincided with Anglesey’s case being used in the national press to justify and strengthen comprehensive reform, showing the discrepancy between the focus of the national debate and the reality of comprehensive schooling in Britain at this time...|$|R

40|$|The various {{economic}} reform strategies undertaken by governments {{over a period}} of about three decades on the agricultural sector in Nigeria were the exploitative strategy, agricultural project strategy, direct production strategy and integrated rural development strategy. Overall, these {{economic reform}} strategies were geared toward the achievement of food self-sufficiency and food security, generation of gainful employment, increased production of raw materials for industries, increased production and processing of export crops, rational utilization of agricultural technologies for the improvement of life of its citizens. These strategies notwithstanding, government also pursued other on-going initiatives to step-up agricultural development across the country. The effects of economic reforms on the agricultural sector was examined alongside its fundamental roles of food security, supply of raw materials to industries,provision of market, employment and foreign exchange as well as generation of savings for investment in agriculture and other sectors. Agriculture contributed minimally during the period in terms of output, market, foreign exchange and capital formation or transfer as a result of policy instability, poor coordination of policies, poor implementation and mismanagement of policy instruments and lack of transparency. It is recommended that an enduring genuine democracy and good governance should be allowed to thrive in Nigeria in order to achieve poverty reduction, sustainable livelihood and food security which will <b>guarantee</b> <b>comprehensive</b> economic development and attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} guarantees {{with a special}} emphasis on the option method of guarantee valuation.

In addition, a minimal number of sources are devoted to the option valuation of guarantees applied to non-traded companies (and their structures) typical for the Czech Republic, which might inter alia have led to the marginal practical experience of the Czech valuation experts with the method. Following the identified blind spots of the current knowledge, the thesis primarily (i) presents coherent theoretical underpinnings of guarantee valuation, (ii) provides a proposed option valuation approach to guarantee valuation and (iii) demonstrates through a case study of the HAME holding an application of the proposed approach, including an evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses. Based on an analysis and synthesis of the domestic and international literature, a poll among the Czech valuation institutes and a numerical application on the historic HAME holding case, the author observes the following main findings: (i) on a theoretical bases, the option guarantee valuation method presents a plausible way of analysis, (ii) the proposed option valuation approach is applicable in the Czech praxis. Despite these positive prima facie findings, the option valuation approach shall be subject to further testing, comparisons with competing methods and improvements resulting from an increased number of its practical applications...|$|R
