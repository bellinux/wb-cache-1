5000|$|... #Caption: Different {{forms of}} <b>coenurus</b> in sheep and rabbits and an adult worm ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{eggs are}} {{expelled}} in feces {{of the dog}} and ingested by the intermediate rabbit host. In the rabbit or other accidental intermediate host the eggs hatch within the intestines then invade the intestinal wall and move into the bloodstream. The larva circulates in the blood to the central nervous system, muscles, or soft tissue where they can form a <b>coenurus</b> metacestode, which is the intermediate stage of the parasite. A <b>coenurus</b> is a fluid-filled cyst {{with one or more}} scoleces surrounded by a fibrous capsule. These normally form after 3 months and are a 10 cm wide lesion. [...] These painless nodules present in the skin or subcutaneous tissue are a sign of infection and are used to diagnose a host with the parasite. [...] Once the <b>Coenurus</b> metacestode has been consumed by the fox or dog, it completes its metamorphosis into an adult tapeworm. In the canid, the worm attaches to the intestine and feeds of the food that the host ingests. There the worm matures and can become as long as 5 meters. The adult cestode produces eggs which are spread into the environment by the feces of the definitive host. This life cycle is also very similar to T. pisiformis a canine and rabbit infecting parasite; however, T. pisiformis infected the body cavity of the rabbit and T. serialis infects muscle and subcutaneous tissue.|$|E
50|$|Coenurosis (a.k.a. Caenurosis and Coenuriasis, gid or sturdy in the vernacular) is a {{parasitic}} infection that develops in the intermediate hosts of some tapeworm species (Taenia multiceps, T. serialis, T. brauni, or T. glomerata) and {{are caused by}} the <b>coenurus,</b> the larval stage of these worms. This disease occurs mainly in sheep and other ungulates, but occasionally can occur in humans too by accidental ingestion of worms' eggs.|$|E
50|$|Treating the lesions can be {{done with}} surgery or medicine. Oral {{praziquantel}} can be used to kill coenuri; however, the dead parasite will cause a large inflammatory response in the host. The inflammation can be managed with the use of corticosteroids. In many cases surgical removal of the <b>coenurus</b> is a safer option with leakage of fluid from the cyst during surgery being unlikely to cause a new cyst and surgical excision is often curative.|$|E
50|$|The eggs of T. serialis are spherical and are 32 to 38 μm in diameter. The larvae form {{bladders}} called <b>Coenurus</b> metacestode {{that can}} grow {{to be as}} large as 10 cm in the intermediate hosts. The larvae are white and can mature to 40mm while the adult can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. Taenia serialis is morphologically very similar to Taenia multiceps; however, they infect {{different areas of the}} body. T. serialis infects the subcutaneous tissue and T. multiceps will commonly infect the eyes and brain.|$|E
5000|$|The {{infection}} with the metacestode larval form (<b>coenurus)</b> of T. serialis is called Coenurosis. [...] When humans ingest these eggs from definitive host remains, the eggs develop into coenuri. This coenuri {{can occur in}} humans within their muscles, brain, eye, or subcutaneous connective tissue though humans are neither the definitive of intermediate hosts of the T. serialis. [...] The symptoms are variable, and depend on the location and number of larvae. [...] Epsiprantel, praziquantel, fenbendazole and surgical removal are used to combat coenuri infection but discretion should be used when treating this evoloving cestode of medical importance.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. A three-and-a-half year-old female Rahmani ewe was {{presented}} suffering from nervous symptoms. Grossly, a large cyst measur-ing 7 × 4 cm and weighing 145 g occupied the dilated left lateral ventricle. The overlying cerebral tissue was thin, atrophied and congested. It tore easily, and the cyst was evacuated spontaneously. Microscopically, liquefactive necrosis surrounded by aggregations of macrophages, eosinophils, lymphocytes, fibroblasts and giant cells was predominantly observed. Hyperplasia and severe necrosis of the ependymal cell {{lining of the}} lateral ventricle were observed. Extensive subependymal inflammatory cell infiltrations, accompanied by neovascularization and fibroblastic proliferation, were seen. Based on the gross and histopathological lesions and cyst morphology and location, the cyst was diagnosed as <b>Coenurus</b> cerebralis. This report describes a rare case of <b>coenurus</b> cyst in the left lateral cerebral ventricle of a ewe and the associated lesion...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out to assess the {{occurrence}} of <b>Coenurus</b> cerebralis infection in Sardinian sheep. A prevalence of 0. 35 % was observed when 566 regularly slaughtered sheep were examined. However, in 120 sheep with suspected symptoms of coenurosis examined from November 2001 to October 2002, a total of 299 cerebral coenurosis lesions were observed with an incidence of 1 % per year. Lesions were classified as migratory, cystic and secondary. Most migratory lesions were found in sheep aged 3 – 6 months. Cavitary lesions containing cysts in different developing stages were found with high incidence per year in sheep aged 7 – 12 months. Secondary lesions due {{to the development of}} <b>Coenurus</b> were most frequent in sheep aged 19 – 36 months. Most sheep were found infected in spring and in early summer, between March and June. Most lesions were located in the cortex. The mean number of protoscolices per cyst was 149 (range 10 – 370) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A case of {{invasion}} of the brain of a 48 -year-old man, a native of Louisiana, by a larval tapeworm is described. Inasmuch as there were no scolices or rostellar hooks present the parasite {{was identified as a}} racemose cysticercus which could be either a sterile <b>coenurus</b> of Taenia multiceps (=Multiceps multiceps), Taenia serialis (=Multiceps serialis), or an aberrant cysticercus of Taenia solium or of a different species of Taenia. Most of the parasite was removed surgically with a preoperative diagnosis of brain tumor. After operation the patient improved, and 32 months after onset of his illness he was working and showed no evidence of a recurrence. The <b>coenurus</b> and the racemose cysticercus are at times essentially indistinguishable except for the presence of scolices with rostellar hooks in the former and their absence in the latter. Invasion of the brain by either of these parasites is a rare condition in the United States. Elsewhere, nu merous cases of racemose cysticercosis, often r...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cerebral {{coenurosis}} {{is caused}} by <b>Coenurus</b> cerebralis, the larval stage of Taenia multiceps. The metacestode causes severe lesions {{in the brain and}} spinal cord of the intermediate host, so-called “gid ” or “stagger ” disease. Whereas, the non-cerebral coenuros{{is caused by}} <b>Coenurus</b> gaigeri, the larval stage of Taenia gaigeri, particularly affects goats. The cyst form of the Taenia gaigeri is found in intramuscular and subcutaneous tissues. The difference in the sequence of mitochondrial genes of cox 1 and nadI and also other variations reported for clinical, morphological and pathological aspects in coenurosis lead to the hypothesis that there is genetic intraspecific variability within this species, such as in other members of the genus Taenia. Nevertheless, {{it has been shown that}} sheep and goats have been infected by both cerebral and non-cerebral coenurosis and it has been suggested that such cerebral and non-cerebral metacestodes may belong to different species of Taenia which are host specific for these hosts...|$|E
40|$|Coenurosis is a {{zoonotic}} disease {{in a variety}} of ruminants caused by the metacestode of Taenia multiceps. The coenuri in the brain and spinal cord of sheep and goats have been identified as <b>Coenurus</b> cerebralis whilst those reported in other tissues have been named <b>Coenurus</b> gaigeri. This study was conducted during {{the spring and summer of}} 2011. Out of 25 739 goats inspected in slaughterhouses, 23 carcasses (0. 09 %) revealed one or multiple visible swellings on the different muscles and visceral organs. The coenuri, of variable sizes, were found mainly in the muscles of the thigh, shoulder and neck, and were less common in the abdominal muscles and subcutaneous tissues. Coenuri were also found in the diaphragm, tongue, intercostal muscles, lung, parotid area and tunica adventitia of the aorta in a goat with severe infection. The brains of slaughtered goats that had coenuri in their skeletal muscles were examined and coenuri were found in two specimens (8. 69 %). The coenuri were located in the occipital lobe, the anterior part of the right cerebrum and the parietal lobe of the left cerebrum. Histopathologically, coenuri in the brain caused pressure atrophy and liquefactive necrosis in the surrounding tissues, hyperaemia, perivascular cuffing, neuronal degeneration, neuronophagia, satellitosis, diffuse microgliosis and astrocytosis. Coenuri in the skeletal muscles caused degenerative and necrotic changes, hyalinisation and myositis. In the lung, tissues around the <b>coenurus</b> revealed atelectasis and focal interstitial fibrosis. In the present study, concurrent occurrence of coenuri in the central nervous system and skeletal muscles supports the hypothesis that C. cerebralis and C. gaigeri are different names for the metacestodes of the same species of tapeworm...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Coenurosis is a {{parasitic}} disease that particularly affects sheep and goats. The disease {{is caused by}} <b>Coenurus</b> cerebralis which is the larval stage of Taenia multiceps. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the clinical and the pathological lesions caused by C. cerebralis in a ewe. Materials and methods: Two-and-a-half year-old female ewe showing neurological signs was presented to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Assiut University, Egypt. Postmortem and histopathological examinations were done to investigate the pathological lessions caused by C. cerebralis. Results: Postmortem examination of the brain revealed <b>Coenurus</b> cyst measuring 5 and times; 3 cm associated with dilated lateral ventricle. Histopathological examination revealed extensive areas of liquefactive necrosis in the cerebrum. The necrotic area was infiltrated with lymphocytes, microglia cells and eosinophils. Internal hydrocephalus and atrophy of the ependymal cells of both lateral ventricle and choroid plexus were also seen. Conclusion: It was concluded that coenurosis might be associated with internal hydrocephalus along with some clinical and pathological findings.

40|$|Out of 19, 046 goats aged between 5 and 6 {{month and}} {{slaughtered}} at an abattoir in Dubai between September 2012 and March 2014, 57 carcasses were objected at meat inspection {{due to the}} presence of bladder worms of the <b>coenurus</b> type. The majority showed single cysts that were cut out but 10 carcasses had to be discharged due {{to the presence of}} multiple cysts and with a maximum number of 41 coenuri. In the majority of carcasses, cysts were located in the legs (n= 45) followed by abdominal muscles (n= 16), diaphragm (n= 14) and shoulder (n= 13). Loin, rack, renal fat, heart, neck, masseter were other cyst locations. The size of the detected parasitic cysts ranged from 0. 7 ml to 90 ml. The maximum number of 1, 102 scolices was counted in an 86 ml <b>coenurus</b> found in the leg of a goat. Cysticercus tenuicollis was another cestode larval stage found in livers of 302 goats. A mixed infection with both parasites was detected in 35 carcasses...|$|E
40|$|This study reports seven {{rare cases}} of non-cerebral {{coenurosis}} in sheep. The sheep were slaughtered in abattoirs of Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) but originated from India, Iran, Oman and Sudan. The prevalence of infection with non-cerebral coenurosis was 0. 008 %. The {{locations of the}} cysts were the triceps brachii muscle, the diaphragm, the infraspinatus muscle of the shoulder, {{the muscles of the}} thigh and the abdomen, and the ommentum. The <b>Coenurus</b> cysts were surrounded by a fibrous, semi-opaque membrane, cloudy white in colour. Altogether, 12 cysts were recovered and all contained a single bladderworm. Cysts had a volume of 7. 3 +/- 1. 30 cm(3) (ml), with 7. 3 +/- 4. 0 clusters of scolices, and an average number of scolices 75. 3 +/- 24. 4. These features in sheep were similar to those reported for non-cerebral <b>Coenurus</b> cysts in goats. No cysts were found in the brain or spinal cord of any of the infected sheep. No clinical evidence of non-cerebral coenurosis had been recorded during the antemortem veterinary inspection of the infected sheep...|$|E
40|$|Coenurosis is {{a central}} nervous system disease of wild and {{domestic}} ruminants caused by <b>Coenurus</b> cerebralis, a bladder worm stage of Taenia multiceps). Even in Sardinia island, this metacestode seems to be widespread in sheep (Scala et al. Vet Parasitol 143 (3 – 4) : 294 – 298, 2007) where coenurosis is an important health problem (Varcasia et al. Parasitol Res 99 (5) : 622 – 626, 2006) the last and unique report of coenurosis in cattle was in 1990 (Cubeddu et al. 1990). In the present paper, a case of bovine coenurosis in Sardinia was described 22 {{years after the first}} report with a morphological a biomolecular characterization. A 2 -year-old Limousine bull was euthanized in the Bolotana (NU) municipality (Central Sardinia). The remote anamnesis achieved from the farmer reporting that the bull showed neurological symptoms from 1 year of age previously classified as nutritional problems by the farm’s veterinary. The breeder also says that the bull have by self-produced the skull fracture by hitting a gaff in the farm. The skull was opened and the brain removed and carefully examined showing two <b>coenurus</b> cysts containing clear fluid with numerous scoleces both in the right hemisphere.

40|$|Sheep were {{experimentally}} {{infested with}} the larval stage of Taenia multiceps. On Day 36 postinfestation 2 animals were treated intraperitoneally with mebendazole at 40 mg/kg body mass. Mature viable coenuri {{were present in}} the cerebra of both these animals when they were killed on Day 114. From Day 36 -Day 49 3 animals were treated daily per os with mebendazole at 100 mg/ kg body mass. At autopsy 1 animal had a developing <b>coenurus</b> in the cerebrum while the other 2 animals were not infested. The drug thus had no effect on the development or viability of the coenuri by either of the 2 routes of administration. When a <b>coenurus</b> from a sheep treated intraperitoneally was fed to a cestode-free dog, 5 adult T. multiceps were recovered from the animal 21 days later. The larvae of this cestode undergo some development in extraneural tissues but rarely attain a size of more than 2 mm before they die and degenerate.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} first case of {{coenurosis}} in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. This disease {{is caused by the}} larval stage of the tapeworm Taenia multiceps (Leske, 1780). The animal in which the disease was diagnosed was an 18 -month-old ewe from an endemic area of Southern Brazil as an imported animal among a group of 30 sheep. The clinic-pathological condition was that commonly found in herbivores affected by the disease, especially sheep. Apathy, nystagmus, intermittent blindness, circling and pressing head against obstacles were the neurological signs reported. The necropsy showed that a brain lesion in the subcortex of the right hemisphere was a bladder-like cyst measuring 4 cm in diameter filled with a translucent fluid with a large number of white spherules (protoscolices) floating. In addition to the identification of the <b>Coenurus</b> cerebralis protoscolices, the brain tissue lesion was histopathologically described...|$|E
40|$|Taenia multiceps {{secretions}} modify accessory cell {{activity in}} macrophages. The present experiments {{were designed to}} elucidate the cellular mechanisms involved. While normal, murine peritoneal macrophages amplified mitogen-activated T-cell proliferation, macrophages modified by exposure to parasite secretions inhibited this proliferation. The modified behaviour was shown by glutaraldehyde-fixed as well as living macrophages, and modification was inducible by FPLC fraction 24 of <b>coenurus</b> fluid and was associated with an expanded population of la- macrophages. Secretory products of parasite-activated macrophages also inhibited T-cell proliferation, and secretion was prevented by indomethacin. The measurement of modified accessory activity was not influenced by the concentration of tritiated thymidine in lymphocyte proliferation assays. Consequently {{there is no evidence}} that the reported events are affected by macrophage-derived, cold thymidine secretion. It is concluded that T. multiceps is able to manipulate macrophage accessory function by mechanisms which involve altered histocompatibility antigen expression and the secretion of prostaglandin...|$|E
40|$|A 4 -year-old Rahmani breed ewe was {{presented}} for surgery to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, South Valley University, Egypt with enlargement and protrusion {{of the eye}} ball, blepharitis and congestion of the conjunctiva. On examination, a cyst 2. 5 cm x 3. 5 cm in diameter containing sandy fluid was detected in the perioptic nerve fat. Histopathological examination revealed that the epithelial lining of the conjunctiva was necrotic and severely infiltrated by neutrophils. The underlying connective tissue was oedematous, hyperaemic and severely infiltrated by neutrophils. Desquamation of the corneal epithelium was seen, together with oedema of the stroma. The tissue surrounding the cyst was compressed and the lacrimal glands revealed pressure atrophy. The muscular tissue was atrophied and infiltrated by fat cells.

40|$|Background: Taenia multiceps is a cestode {{parasite}} {{with its}} larval stage (metacestode), <b>Coenurus</b> cerebralis, mainly encysts {{in the central}} nervous system of sheep and other livestock causing cerebralis coenurosis. Since treatment of coenu-rosis with chemotherapy showed little effect and surgical removal of cysts is not advisable in field conditions, vaccination is useful to control coenurosis. Previous study indicated that immunization with T. multiceps metacestode antigens could in-duce protection in sheep against coenurosis, so the aim {{of this study was to}} identify T. multiceps metacestode antigens in order to find potential vaccine development candidates for further study. Methods: The protein extracts from the larval T. multiceps were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) and characterized by mass spectrometry. Results: A total of 150 protein spots were detected with isoelectric point (pI) val-ue from 4. 97 to 9. 65 and molecular weight from 14 to 98 kDa.

At the necropsy of the case, <b>Coenurus</b> cerebralis cyst (young bladder worm) was found dorsally inside the brainstem, in the site of the tectum mesencephaly. (ii) The second-reported manifestation was a bacterial meningoengephalitis that was witnessed in two lambs of 6 - 7 weeks old. The lambs displayed lateral recumbency with seizure activity. At necropsy, meningoencephalitis with congestion and abscesses were observed in both of them. Interestingly, C. cerebralis cysts were also found in both brains. Streptococcus dysgalactiae was isolated from the abscesses. Possibly, S. dysgalactiae translocation of the blood-brain barrier was facilitated by the migration of the immature stages of C. cerebralis to and through the brain. © 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A {{total of}} 75 {{sheep and goats}} from {{apparently}} healthy and from clinically affected flocks were examined for <b>Coenurus</b> cerebralis cysts from different localities in Egypt. Of 25 animals examined from clinically diseased sheep and goats, 25 (100 %) revealed the presence of infestation with one to four coenuri in the brain. The sites of predilection were the left hemisphere (48 %), followed by the right hemisphere (40 %) and the cerebellum (12 %). There was no apparent effect {{of the age of}} sheep and goats on susceptibility to infestation with C. cerebralis. Another 50 animals from apparently healthy sheep and goat herds presented no C. cerebralis cysts. The cysts from infested sheep could infest newborn puppies experimentally, with a prepatent period of 60 days post infestation. A total of 15 immature worms that were recovered from one puppy did not reach patency until 105 days post infestation with C. cerebralis cyst scolices. Pathological changes in C. cerebralis-infested sheep brain revealed parasitic elements, demyelinated nerve tracts, hyperaemic blood vessels with round cell infiltration, encephalomalacia with round cell infiltration and palisading macrophages and giant cells, as well as focal replacement of the brain parenchyma with caseated and calcified materials. The morphological characteristics of both the larval stage from sheep and goats and adult worms of Taenia multiceps from experimentally infested dogs are described. The results conclude that C. cerebralis is one of the principal causes of nervous manifestations of coenurosis in clinically diseased sheep and goats in Egypt...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} at Debre Berhan, Ethiopia, between 1996 and 1997, into the epidemiology of coenurosis in Menz and Horro breeds of sheeA total of 37 heads from clinically sick and 183 heads from apparently healthy sheep were examined post mortem {{for the presence of}} the cystic larvae of Taenia multicepss, of which 37 and 5 heads, respectively, contained 1 to 8 <b>coenurus</b> cysts (diameter 0. 8 to 6. 5 cm). The bladder worms were located in the cerebral hemisphere in 96 percent of the cases (43 percent and 57 percent for left and right, respectively), 4 percent being in the cerebellum. Prediction of cyst locations based on the direction of circling and head deviation had a 62 percent success rate. A retrospective study generated from the health record book at the ILRI Debre Berhan Station in 1992 - 1996 (199 Horro and 174 Menz) revealed that the incidence of coenurosis ranged from 2. 3 percent to 4. 5 percent. There was no significant breed difference in the incidence. The age of the affected sheep ranged from 4 to 96 months, with a mean of 19. 3 months, and 72 percent of the cases were within the range of 6 to 24 months. In a complementary survey on necropsied stray dogs, 8 out of 17 were positive for Taenia spBoth studies confirm the endemicity of coenurosis at the ILRI Debre Berhan Research Station. Appropriate strategies for the control of coenurosis are suggested...|$|E
40|$|Taenia multiceps is a cestode {{parasite}} {{with its}} larval stage (metacestode), <b>Coenurus</b> cerebralis, mainly encysts {{in the central}} nervous system of sheep and other livestock causing cerebralis coenurosis. Since, treatment of coenurosis with chemotherapy showed little effect and surgical removal of cysts is not advisable in field conditions, vaccination is useful to control coenurosis. Previous study indicated that immunization with T. multiceps metacestode antigens could induce protection in sheep against coenurosis, so the aim {{of this study was to}} identify T. multiceps metacestode antigens in order to find potential vaccine development candidates for further study. The protein extracts from the larval T. multiceps were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) and characterized by mass spectrometry. A total of 150 protein spots were detected with isoelectric point (pI) value from 4. 97 to 9. 65 and molecular weight from 14 to 98 kDa. Twenty-two protein identities were determined by mass spectrometry and 15 unique proteins were obtained. Functional annotation revealed that some of these proteins are involved in catalytic activity, binding, metabolic, cellular process and stress response. Among these molecules are antioxidant proteins (peroxiredoxin and glutathione-S-transferase), glycolytic enzymes (malate dehydrogenase and enolase), proteins with chaperone activity (heat shock protein 70 and small heat shock protein), and structural proteins (actin, actin modulator protein and paramyosin). The identification of T. multiceps metacestode protein will provide valuable information to elucidate their specific roles in the parasitism and screen new targets for vaccine development...|$|E
40|$|Taenia multiceps is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} zoonotic tapeworm of canids. The larval stage of the parasite (<b>Coenurus)</b> occurs in sheep, goat and cattle and has been rarely reported from humans. This study investigated genetic variability of two mitochondrial genes in 102 isolates of T. multiceps. Metacestodes were collected from brains and hearts of sheep in Tehran and Qom provinces of Iran. DNA of each isolate was extracted and used for PCR amplification of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CO 1) and 12 S ribosomal DNA (12 S rRNA) genes. All amplicons were sequenced and the sequence {{data were analyzed using}} NCBI Blast and BioEdit. Phylogenetic trees and pairwise calculations were obtained by using Mega 5 software. In total 7 and 25 representative haplotypes were differentiated for CO 1 and 12 S rRNA genes, respectively. For CO 1 sequences 11 segregation sites within 7 haplotypes were observed. For 12 S rRNA sequences a total of 32 segregation sites were observed in 25 haplotypes. CO 1 gene displayed lower diversity than 12 S rRNA gene with an overall nucleotide variation of 3. 0 % for CO 1 vs. 7. 2 % for 12 S rRNA. Pairwise comparisons among 7 haplotypes in CO 1 and 12 S rRNA genes showed the level of nucleotide differences 0. 3 - 2. 5 % and 0. 2 - 4. 0 %, respectively. A high degree of genetic variation was found in the isolates of T. multiceps in Iran. Additional molecular studies are required on the parasite from other intermediate hosts. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.
