40|$|To {{determine}} whether insulin or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus affects brain glucose metabolism, brain glucose utilization was {{studied in the}} basal state and during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamps in nondiabetic and diabetic Pima Indians by positron emission tomography with 2 -[18 F]fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (18 FDG). Glucose utilization in 75 brain areas was determined by analysis of single scans and by least squares estimation of the rate parameters for the FDG model; these data were compared to results in normal caucasian volunteers.

During the hyperinsulinemic <b>clamps</b> (<b>mean</b> insulin, 11, 708 ?? 3, 026 pmol/L), clearance of 18 FDG from blood was accelerated, and accumulation of brain radioactivity was reduced.

However, {{we hypothesized that}} such sweating is not noradrenergically driven in passively heated, resting humans. To test this, nine supine subjects were exposed to non-thermal stimuli (palmar pain, mental arithmetic and static exercise) known to evoke sweating. Trials consisted of the following four sequential phases: thermoneutral rest; passive heating to elevate (by ∼ 1. 0 ◦C) and <b>clamp</b> <b>mean</b> body temperature and steady-state sweating (perfusion garment and footbath); an atropine sulphate infusion (0. 04 mg kg− 1) with thermal clamping sustained;andfollowingclamp removal. Sudomotor responses from glabrous (hairless) and non-glabrous skin surfaces were measured simultaneously (precursor and discharged sweating). When thermoneutral, these non-thermal stimuli elicited significant sweating only from the palm (P 0. 05). However, when the thermal clamp was removed, core and skin temperatures became further elevated and sweating was restored (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), indicating that the blockade had been overcome, presumably through elevated receptor competition. These observations establish the dependence of both thermal and non-thermal eccrine sweating from glabrous and non-glabrous surfaces on acetylcholine release, and challenge theories concerning the psychological modulation of sweating.

40|$|PURPOSE: Hypoxia {{is one of}} {{the reasons}} for {{radiation}} therapy resistance. Positron emission tomography using (18) F-labeled misonidazole ([(18) F]FMISO) is a non-invasive method of imaging tumor hypoxia. Aim of this study was to validate [(18) F]FMISO against the clinically most widely used hypoxic cell marker pimonidazole under different oxygenation conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCNij 3) and two human glioblastoma (E 102 and E 106) xenograft tumor lines were studied after injection of [(18) F]FMISO and pimonidazole. Control mice were compared with a second group breathing carbogen to reduce tumor hypoxia and with a third group with clamped tumors to increase hypoxia. Tumor sections were analyzed on a phosphor imaging system and consecutively stained immunohistochemically (IHC) for visualization of pimonidazole. Pixel-by-pixel analysis was performed and the hypoxic fraction, obtained after segmentation of the pimonidazole signal, was related to the mean optical density of [(18) F]FMISO and pimonidazole. RESULTS: A moderate pixel-by-pixel correlation between [(18) F]FMISO autoradiography and pimonidazole IHC was found for the control tumors, after carbogen breathing and after clamping for SCCNij 3. For E 102 and E 106, mean signal intensities for pimonidazole significantly decreased after carbogen breathing and increased after <b>clamping,</b> <b>mean</b> [(18) F]FMISO signal intensities increased significantly after clamping and a significant correlation between the hypoxic fractions and the mean [(18) F]FMISO signal intensities was found.

Surgical repair included: severe form of tetralogy of Fallot (4), complex arterial switch operation (7), complex left heart obstruction (5), Rastelli (4), ALCAPA (1), cavopulmonary anastomosis (3) and miscellaneaous (3). Twelve cases were in-hospital preoperatively, of whom 7 were dependent on mechanical ventilatory support. Five patients died while on ECMO because of multi organ failure (4) or pulmonary hypertension (1). Main complications during support included hemorrhages (15 cases), renal failure requiring peritoneal dialysis (14), hemolysis (13), canulas thrombosis (6), and strokes (4). Only 3 cases were free from complication. Duration of ECMO was 5. 4 ± 3. 6 days (1 to 16, median 5), of CICU stay 26 ± 16 days (10 to 69, median 22). Survival to ECMO was 81. 5 % (22 patients) and overall survival was 59 % (16).

Since glabrous skin contains many arteriovenous anastomoses, {{it was important to}} repeat those experiments on non-glabrous regions using the same sample and experimental conditions. Methods Mild hypothermia (mean body temperature 31. 4 °C), normothermia (control: 36. 0 °C) and moderate hyperthermia (38. 3 °C) were induced and clamped (climate chamber and water-perfusion garment) in eight males. Within each condition, five localised thermal treatments (5, 15, 25, 33, 40 °C) were applied to the left forearm and right calf. Steady-state forearm and calf blood flows were measured (venous occlusion plethysmography) for each of the resulting 15 combinations of <b>clamped</b> <b>mean</b> body and local skin temperatures. Results Under the normothermic clamp, cutaneous blood flows averaged 4. 2 mL 100 mL− 1 min− 1 (± 0. 28 : forearm) and 5. 4 mL 100 mL− 1 min− 1 (± 0. 27 : calf). When mildly hypothermic, these segments were unresponsive to localised thermal stimuli, but tracked those changes when normothermic and moderately hyperthermic. For deep-body (oesophageal) temperature elevations, forearm blood flow increased by 5. 1 mL 100 mL− 1 min− 1 °C− 1 (± 0. 9) relative to normothermia, while the calf was much less responsive: 3. 3 mL 100 mL− 1 min− 1 °C− 1 (± 1. 5).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{more rapid}} {{onset of action}} and the shorter {{half-life}} of repaglinide may reduce the post-load glucose excursion and limit sustained insulin secretion compared to sulphonylurea (SU) derivatives. METHODS: We studied 12 patients with type 2 diabetes (age 62 +/- 2 years, BMI 28. 3 +/- 1. 3 kg m(- 2), HbA 1 c 6. 7 +/- 0. 2 %) on SU monotherapy at submaximal dose. Patients were treated for 3 weeks with repaglinide or glibenclamide in a randomized, crossover trial. At {{the end of each}} treatment period, patients underwent a 60 -min hyperglycaemic clamp (glucose 12 mmol L(- 1)) followed by 4 -h observation (60 - 300 min) with frequent blood sampling for determination of glucose, insulin, proinsulin and C-peptide levels. Before the clamp (5 min for repaglinide, 30 min for glibenclamide), patients ingested their usual morning drug dose. RESULTS: After the end of the hyperglycaemic <b>clamp,</b> <b>mean</b> plasma glucose fell to a level of 5 mmol L(- 1) after approximately 150 min with repaglinide, and after approximately 190 min with glibenclamide. While initially quite similar, in the period from 240 to 300 min, insulin, proinsulin and C-peptide levels were lower during repaglinide treatment (insulin 133 +/- 20 vs 153 +/- 25 pmol L(- 1) (P < 0. 05), proinsulin 14 +/- 3 vs 19 +/- 4 pmol L(- 1) (P = 0. 06) and C-peptide 0. 81 +/- 0. 19 vs 1. 14 +/- 0. 18 nmol L(- 1) (P = 0. 05) for repaglinide vs glibenclamide, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Following glucose stimulation, plasma glucose levels, and insulin concentration decrease more rapidly after repaglinide treatment than after glibenclamide. Proinsulin and C-peptide secretion tended to fall more rapidly as well. These findings are consistent with a more rapid onset and shorter duration of beta-cell stimulation associated with repaglinide...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: this {{retrospective}} study was undertaken {{to evaluate whether}} suprarenal aortic cross-clamping increased the perioperative mortality and morbidity as compared to infrarenal clamping, {{in order to create}} the rationale for a more extensive application of this apparently more traumatic manoeuvre. Materials and methods: in a series of 734 elective aortic substitutions for abdominal aneurysm (AA), performed consecutively from January 1992 to June 1999, aortic cross-clamping was performed at a suprarenal level in 56 juxtarenal aneurysms, i. e. aneurysms extending to the lower edge of the renal arteries (8 %, Group 1), and at an infrarenal level in 634 subrenal aneurysms (92 %, Group 2). When analysing preoperative data, the diameter of aneurysms was larger in Group 1 than in Group 2 (p< 0. 005). No {{significant differences were found between}} the two groups as regards age, sex, postinfarction cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal insufficiency and ASA classification of operative risks. Results: the average time of renal exclusion in the juxtarenal aneurysms was 20 min (range 12 – 35 min). There is no difference between the two groups as regards the time of aortic <b>clamping</b> (<b>mean</b> 50 vs. 60 min) or the need for homologous blood transfusion (7 % vs. 11 % of patients). Perioperative (30 days) mortality did not differ: 3. 6 % vs. 1. 9 % (n. s.); nor did the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (3. 6 % vs. 2. 3 %). Renal function deteriorated in 8 (14 %) vs. 0 (0 %) (p< 0. 001) and 1 patient (2 %) required permanent dialysis, as compared to 0 % in Group 2. The incidence of ischaemic colitis was also significantly higher in Group 1 (7 %) than in Group 2 (2 %, p< 0. 01).

40|$|Impaired renal {{acidification}} following acute renal ischemia in the dog. Transient {{renal tubular acidosis}} may complicate acute {{renal failure}} (ARF). To clarify this phenomenon, the present study examined tubular H+ ion secretory capacity in an ischemic model of ARF. Clearance studies were performed in dogs subjected to 60 minutes, unilateral renal artery clamping. The contralateral kidney served as control. One hour after release of <b>clamp,</b> <b>mean</b> glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was reduced by 50 to 70 percent in the ischemic kidney. Bicarbonate reclamation (mEq/liter GFR) was comparable in both kidneys. However, ischemia resulted in impaired distal acidification as judged by three separate maneuvers: minimal urinary pH following sulphate infusion was higher in ischemic than in control kidney (6. 61 ± 0. 39 vs. 5. 39 ± 0. 26, P < 0. 01), mean urine to blood PCO 2 difference (U-B PCO 2) was significantly lower during phosphate infusion (ischemic: 13. 8 ± 4. 1 mm Hg, control: 37. 2 ± 6. 8 mm Hg, P < 0. 01) and was completely abolished during isotonic NaHCO 3 infusion in the ischemic kidney (- 1. 9 ± 3. 4 mm Hg) compared to control (40. 1 ± 14. 8 mm Hg, P< 0. 05). Urinary potassium excretion was intact following ischemia and was appropriately suppressed by amiloride. Administration of 0. 7 M NaHCO 3 solution at a rate sufficient to produce maximally alkaline urine resulted in a similar U-B PCO 2 /UHCO 3 relationship in both kidneys {{in the face of}} impaired distal acidification in the ischemic kidney. This suggests either that the defect may be reversed by massive bicarbonate infusion or, alternatively, that U-B PCO 2 difference may be related to other factors in addition to distal H+ secretion. The data demonstrate that acute renal ischemia in the dog is associated with a defect in distal nephron acidification, most likely of a secretory type...|$|R

40|$|A {{non-invasive}} method and apparatus is disclosed for measuring pressure within a pliable vessel {{such as a}} blood vessel. The blood vessel is <b>clamped</b> by <b>means</b> of a <b>clamping</b> structure having a first portion housing a pressure sensor and a second portion extending over the remote side of the blood vessel for pressing the blood vessel into engagement with the pressure sensing device. The pressure sensing device includes a flat deflectable diaphragm portion arranged to engage {{a portion of the}} blood vessel flattened against the diaphragm by <b>means</b> of the <b>clamp</b> structure. In one embodiment, the clamp structure includes first and second semicylindrical members held together by retaining rings. In a second embodiment the clamp structure is of one piece construction having a solid semicylindrical portion and a hollow semicylindrical portion with a longitudinal slot in the follow semicylindrical portion through which a slip the blood vessel. In a third embodiment, an elastic strap is employed for clamping the blood vessel against the pressure sensing device...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an insert for clamping thin-wall hollow sections, which comprises a support element whose outer cross-section is complementary {{to the inner}} cross-section of the hollow section. The rigid support element is divided into several support wedge elements and supplemented by a rubber-elastic support element on which, preferably, a hose designed to hold a flow medium for internal pressure tests is fitted. The support wedge elements have a clamping device for clamping them together and against the internal surfaces of the hollow section. The rubber-elastic support element has compression device. There must also be at least one channel passing through the clamping and compression device to feed in and carry off flow medium {{in the interior of}} the hollow section, particularly the hose. The thin-wall hollow section of this type supported on the inside can be <b>clamped</b> by <b>means</b> of an external clamping device without deformation and tested for strength in this state u nder def ined, reproducible clamping condition...|$|R

40|$|Internodes of Chara corallina {{were used}} for {{experiments}} in which cell turgor pressure was <b>clamped</b> by <b>means</b> of the pressure probe technique. Essentially, the procedure consisted {{of a combination of}} volume and turgor pressure relaxations. This technique permits the determination of the cell volume by nonoptical means. The values obtained are in agreement with the ones determined by optical means. Furthermore, the hydraulic conductivity (Lp) was determined from the initial slope of the volume relaxation; the values thus obtained are in agreement with those calculated from the half-times of pressure relaxations. The determination of Lp from volume relaxation measurements has the advantage that the cell volume, the volumetric elastic modulus of the cell wall, and the internal osmotic pressure {{do not have to be}} known. Furthermore, the half-time of volume relaxation is longer than that of pressure relaxation, as shown by theory and experiment. This may be used to enhance the resolution of the relaxation measurement and, thus, to improve the accuracy of Lp determinations for higher plant cells which exhibit a very fast pressure relaxation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe UVS cone {{mechanism}} {{is known to}} light adapt at low intensities in comparison to other cones. We were interested in whether this property was related to higher sensitivity in UVS cones or to network adjustments in sensitivity. We investigated spectral sensitivity of 107 individual cone photoreceptors in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using a whole-cell voltage <b>clamp</b> technique. <b>Mean</b> time-to-peak response was 339 ± 90 ms and flash sensitivity for a 100 ms flash was 4. 37 × 10 − 3 ± 2. 50 × 10 − 3 pAphotons− 1 μm 2, with {{no significant differences between}} the UVS, SWS, MWS and LWS cone classes. The spectral sensitivity of the UVS, SWS and LWS cones conformed to the expression of SWS 1, SWS 2 and LWS opsin genes. The spectral sensitivity of MWS cones, however, showed clear evidence of co-expression of RH 2 a and RH 2 b opsin pigments. The fish used in this study bridged the ontogenetic stage where the MWS cones shift their expression from RH 2 b to RH 2 a...|$|R
40|$|EDITORIAL COMMENT: Most busy {{practitioners}} hold strong opinions, {{based on}} clinical experience they will say, of the preferred regimen for management of common clinical problems. This {{study shows that}} strongly held beliefs may be falacious. The authors have shown that drainage of placental blood from the cord {{does not affect the}} rates of retained placenta and postpartum haemorrhage. The editor has always taught that releasing the cord clamp and allowing drainage of placental blood minimizes fetomatemal haemorrhage and assists placental delivery ‐ he stands corrected. However, draining the cord does no harm, and the reviewer of this paper commented that at least it minimizes the mess if the cord breaks during delivery of the placenta by controlled cord traction! Our common clinical regimes should be scrutinized more often, especially when clinical results or community costs are involved. This study did not attempt to assess the value to the fetus of early versus late clamping of the cord. However, the volume of cord blood drained by release of the <b>clamp</b> (<b>mean</b> 54 ml; range 0 – 185 ml) suggests that the practice of early versus late clamping of the cord should be reevaluated to assess the volume of blood denied to the infant and the clinical implications of withholding this blood infusion. Summary: A series of 1, 908 women delivering vaginally, and actively managed in stage 3 of labour, were randomly assigned to 2 groups to study if cord drainage of placental blood facilitated delivery of the placenta. Prophylactic oxytocics were given with the birth of the anterior shoulder. In both groups, early cord clamping was practised, timing being at the midwives 2 ̆ 7 discretion. In the control group the cord remained clamped; in the drainage group the cord was undamped and the volume of placental blood measured. Controlled cord traction completed active management at evidence of separation/descent of the placenta. Rates for retained placenta, postpartum haemorrhage and transfusion were similar. It was concluded that when the third stage of labour is actively managed, placental drainage of cord blood confers no extra benefits. Pre‐ and post‐delivery Kleihauer tests were performed on blood from 20 women in each group. All tests were negative. Contrary to previous work, this does not suggest that cord drainage reduces the fetomatemal transfusion rate. The well known association of prolonged duration of stage 3 of labour and the risk of haemorrhage was strongly confirmed. Copyrigh...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} solutions of the two-dimensional Koiter {{model and}} of the three-dimensional linear shell model in the case where the shell is <b>clamped</b> and its <b>mean</b> surface is elliptic. For smooth data, these solutions admit multiscale expansions in powers of ε^ 1 / 2 where ε denotes the (half-) thickness of the shell. Both expansions contain terms independent of ε and boundary layer terms exponentially decreasing with respect to r/√ε, with r {{the distance to the}} boundary of the mean surface. The expansion of the three-dimensional displacement contains supplementary boundary layers, exponentially decreasing with respect to r/ε like for plates. Using these expansions we obtain sharp estimates between the two models in various norms...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe performance of magnetic <b>clamps</b> as a <b>means</b> of attaching accelerometers for machinery vibration surveys is investigated. Three conditions that might adversely affect magnetic clamp effectiveness are {{looked at in}} detail: (1) the presence of cross-motion, (2) the mounting conditions, and (3) the presence of high levels of acceleration. Results are given for six commercially produced magnetic clamps. Cross-motion and high acceleration are found to have little effect on magnetic clamp response to the extent tested. Improper mounting is found to affect response greatly. Procedures are recommended for attachment of clamps and results of tests using these procedures are shown to be reproducible.
