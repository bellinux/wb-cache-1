50|$|The ATOL is a {{two-seater}} amphibious aircraft with {{a composite}} wood structure; it has tail wheel type landing gear which is retractable for water operations. Special {{attention has been}} paid to the aircraft’s safe handling features. For example, the change in trim caused by changes in power has been directed correctly (the nose rises when the power is reduced). The <b>canopy</b> <b>lifts</b> backwards together with the instrument panel. This feature enables the aircraft to be accessed/exited through the front deck.|$|R
5000|$|The cockpit {{is covered}} by a two-piece bubble canopy {{providing}} 360 degrees of visual coverage for the pilot. The <b>canopy</b> <b>lifts</b> upwards to permit cockpit entry and exit. The Controls {{take the form of}} a conventional centre stick and a throttle stick located to the left of the pilot. These also incorporate [...] "hands on throttle and stick" [...] (HOTAS) controls. A zero-zero ejection seat is provided for the pilot, permitting safe ejection in an emergency even at zero altitude and zero speed.|$|R
5|$|Work on the {{construction}} of the gallery spaces and initial preparation for the dome began {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2013. On 5 December 2013, the first element of the museum's <b>canopy</b> was <b>lifted</b> into place.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{announced}} by Northern that in 2010 the station would undergo a £8.5 million refurbishment, {{as part of}} the [...] "Rotherham Renaissance" [...] plans for the regeneration of the town. The 1980s station buildings and ramps would be replaced by a new travel centre, along with new platform <b>canopies,</b> <b>lifts</b> and CCTV. As part of this the car park would also be redesigned. A temporary station entrance would be constructed for passenger use while the buildings were replaced. Work on the project commenced on Monday, 22 February 2010 with a temporary station entrance being constructed, expected to come into operation during March. The temporary station opened on Friday 9 July and the old travel centre demolished a month later. After being dogged by delays, the new station buildings and platforms opened for public use on Friday 24 February 2012.|$|R
60|$|While our adventurer {{was engaged}} in the gloomy musings that such {{impressions}} were not ill adapted to excite, the heavens and the sea began to exhibit another aspect. The bright streak which had so long hung along the eastern horizon, as though the curtain of the firmament had been slightly opened to admit a passage for the winds, was now suddenly closed; and heavy masses of black clouds began to gather in that quarter, until vast volumes of the vapour were piled upon the water, blending the two elements in one. On the other hand, the dark <b>canopy</b> <b>lifted</b> in the west, and a long belt of lurid light was shed over the view. In this flood of bright and portentous mist the stranger still floated, though there were moments when his faint and fanciful outlines seemed to be melting into thin air.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{designer of}} the 304 was Martin Hansen, known {{for his role in}} the design of the Akaflieg Braunschweig SB-11. The glider continued the Glasflügel tradition of innovation: the parallelogram control stick, combined trailing edge flaps and airbrakes, automatic trimming, heel-operated brakes, automatic control connections, the extremely easy assembly of the wings and tailplane, the parallelogram forward-opening <b>canopy</b> and <b>lifting</b> instrument panel are Glasflügel innovations largely copied by other manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|The Vittoria had a plywood-skinned, hexagonal-cross-section, wooden-framed fuselage, {{with deep}} sides which converged {{somewhat}} downwards. Its cockpit was immediately {{in front of}} the wing pedestal, beneath a framed <b>canopy</b> which <b>lifted</b> off, reinforced by {{a small part of the}} upper fuselage skin, for access. Comfortable seating was in-flight adjustable and the visibility was good. The fuselage tapered markedly rearwards as the pedestal dropped away. A straight-edged, round-tipped tailplane was mounted on top of it, carrying elevators with a notch for rudder movement. The fin was very small but mounted a rounded, broad-chord, balanced rudder which reached down to the keel largely to the rear of the elevators. The glider landed on a sprung skid reaching from the nose to beyond mid-chord, assisted by a generous tail bumper.|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} a line to Alton via the Meon Valley, {{branching}} from the Eastleigh route at Knowle, north of the tunnel. It was built initially as a fast route to the Isle of Wight - to express standards though only a single line on double track earthworks - {{at a time when}} Stokes Bay, not Portsmouth Harbour, was the primary rail-connected ferry terminus for the Island. That route closed to passengers in 1955.In the early 21st century a new footbridge and lifts were erected {{to the north of the}} station buildings and <b>canopies.</b> The <b>lifts</b> allows the station to comply with the Equality Act 2010, providing wheelchair access to all platforms. Related work has included fitting tactile strips to all three platforms. Work commenced in October 2008 and was undertaken by Osborne Rail Division. The ticket office was reopened with a new entrance to the platform at the south end of the corridor. Ticket barriers were also installed and a new station shop constructed at the end of the station building on Platform 3. Work to replace & renew nine sets of points & 240 metres of track at the station in October 2016 has seen all services here replaced by buses (between Eastleigh & Swanwick and Portsmouth Harbour) for nine days (22-30 October inclusive).|$|R
40|$|Transitional spaces {{refer to}} those spaces located {{in-between}} {{interior and exterior}} environments acting as both buffer spaces and physical links, such as entrance <b>canopies,</b> foyers, <b>lift</b> lobbies, corridors, stairwells, etc. As transitional spaces may constitute {{a significant portion of}} the building volume and have large implications to occupants’ experience and building energy consumption, many research studies have come up in recent years to examine their conditions and characteristics. This research aims to investigate the thermal conditions and subjective thermal perceptions of occupants in the different types of transitional spaces. Semi-opened and fully enclosed lift lobbies and corridors in The University of Hong Kong (HKU) campus were chosen for the field study. Theoretical study, survey questionnaires and simple energy simulation have been implemented to examine the thermal comfort requirements, people’s perceptions and energy impact of transitional spaces. It was found that an opened area is easily influenced by variable weather conditions as it is close to natural environment while an enclosed one is totally separated from the exterior environment and commonly air-conditioned. This may lead to different subjective thermal responses in these two types of spaces. It was also discovered that people can accept wider thermal environment in transitional spaces and their thermal response varies with dressing, activity level, past thermal experience and prior thermal preference. It is believed that the current comfort standards and criteria are not designed for transitional spaces. The proposed thermal comfort ranges for transitional spaces were examined in this study using modified adaptive comfort model. This could be used to consider possible changes to the current design guidelines and standards. If the transitional spaces are designed with appropriate energy saving strategies such as passive design, hybrid ventilation and flexible HVAC controls, it can help achieve more energy efficient and healthy buildings in the future. postprin...|$|R
40|$|The {{photosynthesis}} {{of various}} species {{or even a}} single plant varies dramatically in time and space, creating great spatial heterogeneity within a plant canopy. Continuous and spatially explicit monitoring is, therefore, required to assess the dynamic response of plant photosynthesis to the changing environment. This is a very challenging task when using the existing portable field instrumentation. This paper reports on {{the application of a}} technique, laser-induced fluorescence transient (LIFT), developed for ground remote measurement of photosynthetic efficiency at a distance of up to 50  m. The LIFT technique was used to monitor the seasonal dynamics of selected leaf groups within inaccessible canopies of deciduous and evergreen tree species. Electron transport rates computed from LIFT measurements varied over the growth period between the different species studied. The <b>LIFT</b> <b>canopy</b> data and light-use efficiency measured under field conditions correlated reasonably well with the single-leaf pulse amplitude-modulated measurements of broadleaf species, but differed significantly in the case of conifer tree species. The LIFT method has proven to be applicable for a remote sensing assessment of photosynthetic parameters on a diurnal and seasonal scale; further investigation is, however, needed to evaluate the influence of complex heterogeneous canopy structures on LIFT-measured chlorophyll fluorescence parameters...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the DM- 1 Glider, which had approximately triangular plan form, an aspect ratio of 1. 8 and a 60 degree sweptback leading edge, has been conducted in the Langley full-scale tunnel. The investigation consisted of {{the determination of the}} separate effects of the following modifications made to the glider on its maximum lift and stability characteristics: (a) installation of sharp leading edges over the inboard semispan of the wing, (b) removal of the vertical fin, (c) sealing of the elevon control-balance slots, (d) installation of redesigned thin vertical surfaces, (e) installation of faired sharp leading edges, and (f) installation of <b>canopy.</b> The maximum <b>lift</b> coefficient of the DM- 1 glider was increased from 0. 61 to 1. 01 by the installation of semispan sharp leading edges, and from 1. 01 to 1. 24 by the removal of the vertical fin and sealing of the elevon control-balance slots. The highest maximum lift coefficient (1. 32) was obtained when the faired sharp leading edges and the thin vertical surfaces were attached to the glider. The original DM- 1 glider was longitudinally stable. The semispan sharp leading edges shifted the neutral point forward approximately 3 percent of the root chord at moderate lift coefficients, and the glider configuration with these sharp leading edges attached was longitudinally unstable, for the assumed center-of-gravity location, at lift coefficients above 0. 73. Sealing the elevon control-balance slots and installing the faired sharp leading edges, the thin vertical surfaces, and the canopy shifted the neutral point forward approximately 8 percent of the root chord...|$|R
40|$|As one {{phase of}} a {{comprehensive}} canopy load investigation, conventional front and rear sliding canopies which are typified by installation on the SB 2 C- 4 E airplane, were tested in the Langley full-scale tunnel to determine the pressure distributions and the aerodynamic loads on the canopies. A preliminary analysis {{of the results of}} these tests is presented in this report. Plots are presented that show the distribution of pressure at four longitudinal stations through each canopy for a range of conditions selected {{to determine the effects of}} varying <b>canopy</b> position, yaw, <b>lift</b> coefficient, and power. The results indicate that the maximum loads, based on the external-internal pressure differential, for the front and rear canopies were obtained with the airplane simulating the high speed flight condition. The highest loading on the front canopy was in the exploding direction for the configuration with the front and rear canopies closed. The highest loads on the rear canopy were in the crushing direction with the front canopy open and the rear canopy closed. For most of the simulated flight conditions, the highest loads on the front canopy, per unit area, were over twice as great as the highest loads on the rear canopy when the comparison was made for the most critical canopy configuration in each case. The external pressure distribution over the front and rear canopies, which were fairly symmetrical to 0 degree angle of yaw, were greatly distorted at other yaw attitudes, particularly for the propeller operating conditions. These distorted pressure distributions resulted in local exploding and crushing loads on both canopies which were often considerably higher than the average canopy loads...|$|R
