5|$|Around 2 pm, the British barges {{carrying}} artillery floated {{down the}} La <b>Chute</b> River, and, contrary to plan, came down a channel between {{an island in}} the La <b>Chute</b> and the shore. This brought them within range of the French left and some of the fort's guns. Fire from cannons on the fort's southwest bastion's sank two of the barges, spurring the remaining vessels to retreat.|$|E
5|$|As loading proceeded, a cone of coal {{built up}} below the anti-breakage box until {{it reached the}} height {{of the end of the}} <b>chute.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} the anti-breakage box was swung {{out of the}} way and the coal allowed to run {{directly}} down the <b>chute</b> and down the sides of the cone at its angle of repose.|$|E
50|$|The {{opening of}} Temerity has {{disrupted}} the natural {{functioning of the}} avalanche <b>chutes</b> that cut through the forest. Powerful avalanches would rip through the <b>chutes</b> periodically, destroying trees {{on the edges of}} the <b>chutes</b> and at the bottom. Now that the avalanches have stopped, trees have begun to grow closer into the <b>chutes.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{focus is}} on design, more specifically, "animal {{handling}} facilities which are labor saving and reduce bruise losses". The article studies: Unloading <b>Chutes,</b> Stockyard Design, Hog Plant Stockyard, General Purpose Small Stockyard, Beef Stockyard, Cattle Crowding Pens, Hog Crowding Pens, Slopes in <b>Chutes</b> and Crowding Pens, Single File <b>Chutes</b> General Recommendations, Single File <b>Chutes</b> for Cattle, Slaughter Restrainers...|$|R
50|$|There {{were four}} major methods of loading ships at dog-holes: lightering, slide, apron or gravity <b>chutes,</b> wire or trapeze <b>chutes,</b> and wharfing.|$|R
5|$|Near {{the area}} where Bernetz Brook enters the La <b>Chute,</b> Captain Trépezet and his troop, who were {{attempting}} {{to return to the}} French lines, encountered Phineas Lyman's Connecticut regiment, sparking a skirmish in the woods. General Howe's column was near the action, so he led it in that direction. As they approached the battle scene, General Howe was hit and instantly killed by a musket ball. A column of Massachusetts provincials, also drawn to the battle, cut off the French patrol's rear. In desperate fighting, about 150 of Trepézet's men were killed, and another 150 were captured. Fifty men, including Trepézet, escaped by swimming across the La <b>Chute.</b> Trepézet died the next day of wounds suffered in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Using {{hydraulic}} power, {{the cradle}} was tilted to an angle, so the coal {{ran out of}} the wagon and down a coal <b>chute</b> into the hold of the vessel below.|$|E
5|$|Following this success, Jackson {{began to}} direct several {{personal}} insults at Silva, {{a gesture that}} infuriated the champion. Silva {{was in the midst}} of what would be a 17-fight unbeaten streak. He captured the championship from Sakuraba at Pride 17, and defeated him a total of three times. Jackson continued his negative comments towards the champion, and directed his latest insult at Silva's training camp at the time, the <b>Chute</b> Boxe Academy.|$|E
50|$|The Coulonge <b>Chutes</b> (in French: <b>Chutes</b> Coulonge) is a {{non-profit}} recreation park and historical exhibition area operating in Mansfield-et-Pontefract, in the Pontiac Regional County Municipality of western Quebec, Canada. Its main attraction is the 42 m high Grandes <b>Chutes</b> waterfall of the Coulonge River and 100 m long cement log slide.|$|R
50|$|Gasp {{opened with}} 12 <b>chutes,</b> {{although}} as the ride control system was upgraded and popularity decreased, that number {{was reduced to}} 8 <b>chutes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Laundry <b>chutes</b> {{in hotels}} {{are placed on}} each floor to allow the {{expedient}} transfer and collection of dirty laundry to the hotel's laundry facility without having to use elevators or stairs. In stories, laundry <b>chutes</b> are commonly used as means for the protagonist to quickly escape, the laundry at the <b>chute's</b> base often serving to cushion the hero's fall. These <b>chutes</b> are generally aluminized steel and welded together to avoid any extruding parts that may rip or damage the materials.|$|R
5|$|The AM-1Q was {{developed}} for electronic countermeasures (ECM) duties. The fuselage fuel tank was removed {{to make room for}} the ECM operator and his equipment in a windowless compartment. The aircraft carried several radio and radar receivers, transmitters and a signal analyzer. The operator could also drop bundles of chaff through a <b>chute</b> to block radar signals.|$|E
5|$|While {{designing}} the Creighton-Ward Mansion sets, Bell {{and his staff}} strove for authenticity, ordering miniature Tudor paintings, -scale Georgian- and Regency-style furniture and carpeting {{in the shape of}} a polar bear skin. This realism was enhanced by adding scrap items acquired from household waste and electronics shops. For example, a vacuum cleaner pipe serves as Virgil Tracy's launch <b>chute.</b>|$|E
5|$|Abercrombie held a war {{council that}} evening. The options he {{presented}} {{to his staff}} were limited to asking if the next day's attack should be in three ranks or four; the council opted for three. Abercrombie's plan of attack omitted Clerk's recommendation to fortify the summit of Rattlesnake Hill; {{in addition to the}} frontal assault, 4 six-pound guns and a howitzer were to be floated down the La <b>Chute</b> River and mounted at the base of Rattlesnake Hill, with 20 bateaux of troops to support the effort.|$|E
50|$|Escape <b>chutes</b> {{are also}} {{installed}} in {{air traffic control}} towers where space for redundant stairwells is limited. Escape <b>chutes</b> were tested at the control tower at Kadena Air Base.|$|R
50|$|The <b>chutes</b> utilize either springs or {{compressed}} air launchers {{to get the}} <b>chutes</b> into the air {{as fast as possible}} and to avoid the dead air behind the car.|$|R
50|$|The back bowls, {{and upper}} part of Peak 8, are {{composed}} of advanced and expert terrain. The Peak 8 back bowl area is composed of expert <b>chutes.</b> The lower part of this area is accessible by the Peak 8 SuperConnect's midway load station, while the upper part is accessible by Lift 6. Two lifts on Peak 8 go above tree-line: the T-Bar, accessible from the Rocky Mountain SuperChair, services northern Peak 8's <b>chutes.</b> The Imperial Express SuperChair, reachable from Lift 6, is North America's highest operating chairlift, and services the Imperial Bowl, the Lake <b>Chutes,</b> {{and access to the}} Peak 7 Bowl, which includes some very difficult terrain with slopes up to 55 degrees. Hiking {{from the top of the}} Imperial lift allows access to the summit of Peak 8 and a variety of cornices and <b>chutes.</b> It can get very windy and cold at the top, and in poor visibility conditions the peak will usually be closed. The Lake <b>Chutes,</b> a series of daunting <b>chutes</b> with an incline of up to 55 degrees is reachable from the top of Imperial. The <b>chutes</b> are some of the steepest terrain in the region, running vertically for about 400 ft.|$|R
5|$|Between the 1810s and 1850s {{there were}} a series of changes in {{ownership}} and management. These coincided with a Puritan revival and a fall in Bath's popularity; reductions in receipts were compounded by rising payments for actors from London. As a result, the theatre underwent financial crises and fell into a period of decline. Fortunes began to improve when James Henry <b>Chute,</b> who was {{the manager of the}} Bath Assembly Rooms and the son-in-law of the owner Mrs Macready, took over as the manager of the theatre and once again audiences began to rise.|$|E
5|$|Bloody Fun Days {{theme was}} {{inspired}} by the short story Everything Can Be Beaten by Jhonen Vasquez. The story centres on a monster called It, who spends his life in the confines of a single room, waiting in front of a <b>chute</b> that kittens slide down. He crushes the kittens with a hammer. One day It decides to leave the room, and encounters a world full of 'cute' animals. It responds by crushing the creatures, the only thing he is capable of doing.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} {{expected}} that use of the chutes to transfer salt between the canal and the river would cease once the lift was opened, but {{by the turn of}} the 19th century, although there were 190,000 tons of cargo using the lift each year, 38,000 tons of salt were still being transferred by <b>chute.</b> From the middle of the 19th century, some of the salt traffic transferred to the railways, and the use of pipelines through which the brine was pumped also affected trade, but as that source of revenue declined, a chemical industry developed in the area around Northwich, which became the major source of income for the Navigation.|$|E
50|$|Akin to these, {{man-made}} <b>chutes,</b> such as {{the timber}} slide and log flume, {{were used in the}} logging industry to facilitate the downstream transportation of timber along rivers. These are no longer in common use. Man-made <b>chutes</b> may also be a feature of spillways on some dams. Some types of water supply and irrigation systems are gravity fed, hence <b>chutes.</b> These include aqueducts, puquios, and acequias.|$|R
40|$|The North Side Dock on Kelleys Island was {{elevated}} {{and equipped}} with pockets and <b>chutes.</b> A steam locomotive pulled carloads of stone {{across the top}} of the dock, and the stone was unloaded into pockets when a barge or steamer tied up to take on stone; <b>chutes</b> were lowered so that stone dropped into the barges. This photograph shows three <b>chutes</b> lowered and seven raised...|$|R
50|$|The docks {{storage bins}} or pockets {{typically}} are wider {{at the top}} than the bottom, and lead to movable steel <b>chutes.</b> These <b>chutes</b> project {{out over the water}} at a slight angle from the sides of the docks. The hinged <b>chutes,</b> which when lowered allow ore to drop into ships from the pockets, are located at twelve-foot intervals over the length of the dock.|$|R
5|$|McCarthy {{was born}} in 1908 {{on a farm in}} the Town of Grand <b>Chute</b> in Outagamie County, Wisconsin, the fifth of seven children. His mother, Bridget (Tierney), was from County Tipperary, Ireland. His father, Timothy McCarthy, {{was born in}} the United States, the son of an Irish father and a German mother. McCarthy dropped out of junior high school at age 14 to help his parents manage their farm. He entered Little Wolf High School, in Manawa, Wisconsin, when he was 20 and {{graduated}} in one year.|$|E
5|$|Other attractions {{that closed}} {{at about the}} same time as the zoo {{included}} the boating on Firework Lake, and the miniature railway. In 1979 the amusement park was leased to the main concessionaire, Alf Wadbrooke, although by then it was only open at weekends during the summer season. The long-promised restoration of the Scenic Railway had not happened and the Water <b>Chute</b> had closed. In August 1980, Wadbrooke was given notice to close down the park by 26October 1980 and to have all his equipment removed by February 1981.|$|E
5|$|A serious {{accident}} with radioactivity release {{occurred in the}} 3026-D facility at about 5 pm on 29 April 1954. After {{the dissolution of the}} third batch of uranium slugs, the liquid in the dissolver tank did not completely cover the slugs for about 29 hours, which overheated due to decay heat. When the acid was added for the fourth batch, the violent reaction with the hot metal produced gases and forced the solution up the slug loading <b>chute</b> and the pipes. The building staff donned their gas masks and evacuated the building. Radiation levels {{on the third floor of}} the building reached 100roentgen per hour (R/h), and were reduced to 100mR/h by 7 am the next day. The highest exposure to a person was 1.25R of hard radiation and 4.7roentgen equivalent physical of soft radiation.|$|E
5000|$|In {{more recent}} decades, {{buildings}} such as Chicago's John Hancock Center, the Chrysler Building, {{and the old}} RCA Building in New York City have shut down their <b>chutes.</b> The reason is the increase of modern mail rooms in the building lobby with associated mail boxes available for the building tenants. There remain, however, about 360 buildings in Chicago with mail <b>chutes,</b> and more than 900 active <b>chutes</b> exist in Manhattan and the Bronx of New York City alone, as well as elsewhere. Since 1997, however, the National Fire Protection Association has banned mail <b>chutes</b> in all new building construction. Buildings currently using mail <b>chutes</b> in New York include the Chanin Building, Trinity Building, Empire State Building, Port Authority Bus Terminal, and in Boston the historic [...] Lenox Hotel in the Back Bay.|$|R
50|$|As built, the tramway {{terminus}} {{was a lot}} {{higher than}} the canal, and long <b>chutes</b> were used to load the limestone into boats. Because this caused damage to the boats and the noise disturbed the occupants of the castle, a steeper tramway was constructed, which resulted in shorter <b>chutes,</b> less noise and less damage. One of the shorter metal <b>chutes</b> is still visible on the canal bank, below the castle walls.|$|R
40|$|Eighty-two {{percent of}} public firms have golden parachutes (or “chutes”) under which CEOs and senior {{officers}} may be paid {{tens of millions}} of dollars upon their employer’s change in control. What justifies such extraordinary payouts? Much of the conventional analysis views <b>chutes</b> as excessive compensation granted by captured boards, focusing on the payouts that occur following a takeover. Those explanations, if they ever were complete, miss the mark today. This Article demonstrates, theoretically and empirically, that <b>chutes</b> are less relevant to a firm during a takeover than they are before a takeover, particularly in relation to firms that invest in innovation. <b>Chutes</b> assure managers of realizing the long-term value of their work, even if the firm is later acquired. As a result, managers are more likely to make specific investments in innovation whose value may not be realized for some time — but that which are essential to sustaining long-term performance. Moreover, when granted, a <b>chute’s</b> expected cost is a small fraction of what may be paid, reflecting the real likelihood a payment will never be made. That cost is more than offset by the value of the specific investments in innovation that managers are now more likely to make. Consequently, granting <b>chutes</b> tends to increase the value of innovative firms — promoting, rather than jeopardizing, shareholder interests in such firms. Nevertheless, an analysis of <b>chutes</b> as a valuable tool in promoting innovation is largely missing from the corporate law scholarship, with important consequences. Two, in particular, are the negative view of proxy advisors on <b>chutes,</b> and recent federal Say-on-Golden-Parachute legislation that mandates certain types of disclosure regarding <b>chutes.</b> We recommend changes that properly reflect the low expected cost of <b>chutes</b> and their positive effect on innovation...|$|R
5|$|Around 17 hours later, {{the plane}} loses {{auxiliary}} power, {{and the lights}} go out inside. Despite Neerja and the other attendants' attempts to explain, the terrorists assume the Pakistanis cut the power deliberately, and anticipate an imminent Pakistani raid on the plane. The panicking hijackers begin shooting down passengers indiscriminately; at great peril to her own life, Neerja opens the rear door and deploys the <b>chute,</b> directing passengers out of the plane. Choosing to let the passengers escape first, Neerja is fatally shot by the terrorists when she tries to shield young children from the gunfire. The film ends with a tribute to Neerja, who was eventually honoured posthumously with the Ashoka Chakra, India's highest military decoration awarded for peacetime valor, courageous action or self-sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|EVE {{brings the}} plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's {{recordings}} of Earth and concludes {{that they must}} return. However, AUTO refuses, revealing his own secret no-return directive A113, issued to BnL autopilots after the corporation concluded years earlier that the planet could not be saved. He mutinies, tasering WALL-E and deactivating EVE and throwing them both down the garbage <b>chute,</b> then detaining McCrea. EVE automatically reactivates and helps WALL-E bring the plant to the ship's Holo-Detector chamber; AUTO tries to close the chamber, crushing WALL-E when he struggles to keep it open, but McCrea is able to deactivate him and destroy GO-4, while EVE inserts the plant to activate the hyperjump.|$|E
5|$|From the hoppers, {{the waste}} falls onto the furnace-charging <b>chute</b> {{and from there}} onto the incinerating grate. Here it is burned at a {{temperature}} in excess of 1,200°C. This heat is then converted into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers steam turbines, much {{in the same way}} as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled condenser. The cooled water is treated and reused in the boilers.|$|E
50|$|At one time, {{the river}} was used to {{transport}} logs to sawmills downstream. It flows through <b>Chutes</b> Provincial Park, which was named after <b>chutes</b> used to bypass rapids on this river. The river is now mainly used for recreational canoeing, and kayaking.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chutes</b> are {{in common}} use in tall {{buildings}} {{to allow the}} rapid transport of items from the upper floors to a central location {{on one of the}} lower floors or basement. <b>Chutes</b> may be round, square or rectangular at the top and/or the bottom.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Chutes</b> de la Kagera (Kagera Falls or <b>Chutes</b> de la Karera) are a {{spectacular}} series of waterfalls in southeastern Burundi. They are located {{to the south}} of Rutana. The falls occupy over 142 hectares, being made up of six branches divided on three landings.|$|R
