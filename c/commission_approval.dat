Since this ruling, Sara Lee has been prevented from acquiring any further assets or firms associated with chemical shoe care products in the United States without prior <b>commission</b> <b>approval.</b> The Competition Commission in the United Kingdom investigated the potential monopoly of Sara Lee in the shoe care industry.

500|$|As {{established}} in the EPB's [...] "Organization of the EPB", the organization operates in a systemic and hierarchic structure. The entire organization is overseen by a central committee, which is generally focused on politics and policies. Beneath it lies a military commission, {{which in turn is}} divided by sub commissions specialized in finances, intelligence, transportation, provisions and general services and others as needed. Each commando receives additional salary, with specific exemptions being given to marriages, unemployed individuals and those with dependents. In December 1981, the EPB included benefits similar to those in the American military. The organization agreed to medical services and college education pending <b>commission</b> <b>approval.</b> New recruits may be covertly trained in rural farms or in foreign countries (Cuba being an example) and inconspicuous businesses may be used to provide cover to certain individuals. Training includes skills such as lock picking, handling firearms and explosives, forging documents, scuba diving, photography, concealment using makeup and forging license plates.

2500|$|After Genovese {{was sent}} to prison in 1959, the family {{leadership}} secretly established a [...] "Ruling Panel" [...] to run the family in Genovese's absence. This first panel included acting boss Thomas [...] "Tommy Ryan" [...] Eboli, underboss Gerardo [...] "Jerry" [...] Catena, and Catena's protégé Philip [...] "Benny Squint" [...] Lombardo. After Genovese died in 1969, Lombardo was named his successor. [...] However, the family appointed a series of [...] "front bosses" [...] to masquerade as the official family boss. [...] The aim of these deceptions was to protect Lombardo by confusing law enforcement about who was the true leader of the family. In the late 1960s, Gambino boss Carlo Gambino loaned $4 million to Eboli for a drug scheme {{in an attempt to}} gain control of the Genovese family. When Eboli failed to pay back his debt, Gambino, with <b>Commission</b> <b>approval,</b> murdered Eboli in 1972.|$|E

In fact, the commission has very little to do with the regulation of mobile phone service, outside of [...] "undue preference" [...] issues (for example, a carrier offering a superior rate or service to some subscribers and not others without a good reason). It does not regulate service rates, service quality, or other business practices, and <b>commission</b> <b>approval</b> is not necessary for wireless provider sales or mergers as in the broadcasting industry. Moreover, it does not deal with the availability of spectrum for mobile phone service, which is part of the Industry Canada mandate, nor the maintenance of competition, which is largely the responsibility of The Competition Bureau.|$|E
2500|$|... (1953–1985) between Carlo Gambino, Tommy Lucchese, and Vito Genovese {{began with}} a plot {{to take over the}} Mafia Commission by murdering family bosses Frank Costello and Albert Anastasia. At that time, Gambino was Anastasia's new underboss and Vito Genovese was the underboss for Costello. Their first target was Costello on May 2, 1957. Costello survived the {{assassination}} attempt, but immediately decided to retire as boss in favor of Genovese. Their second target was Anastasia on October 25, 1957. The Gallo brothers (from the Colombo family) murdered Anastasia in a Manhattan barber shop, opening the war for Gambino to become the new boss of the now-Gambino crime family. After assuming power, Gambino started conspiring with Lucchese to remove their former ally Genovese. In 1959, with the assistance of Lucky Luciano, Costello, and Meyer Lansky, Genovese was arrested and Gambino assumed full control with Lucchese of the Mafia Commission. Under Gambino and Lucchese, the Commission pushed Bonanno boss Joseph Bonanno out of power, triggering an internal war in that family. In the 1960s, the Commission backed the Gallo brothers in their rebellion against Profaci family boss Joe Profaci. In 1962, Gambino's oldest son Thomas married Lucchese's daughter, strengthening the Gambino and Lucchese family alliance. Lucchese gave Gambino access into the New York airports rackets he controlled, and Gambino allowed Lucchese into some of their rackets. After Lucchese death in July 1967, Gambino used his power over the Commission to appoint Carmine Tramunti as the new Lucchese family leader. Gambino later continued the alliance with Tramunti's successor, Anthony Corallo. After Gambino's death, new Gambino boss Paul Castellano continued the Lucchese alliance. In 1985, the original Gambino-Lucchese alliance dissolved when John Gotti ordered Castellano's assassination and took power in the Gambino family without <b>Commission</b> <b>approval.</b>|$|E
