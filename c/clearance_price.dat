40|$|Abstract. Oligopolistic {{retailers}} {{decide on}} the initial inventories of an undifferentiated limited-lifetime product offered to strategic consumers. A manufacturer sets the first-period (full) price, while the second-period (<b>clearance)</b> <b>price</b> is determined by a market clearing process. The resulting symmetric pure-strategy equilibria may lead to no sales in {{the first or second}} period (Cournot outcome versus collusion), and sales in both periods with the <b>clearance</b> <b>price</b> above or at the salvage value. The equilibria possess a comprehensive set of monotonic properties. In particular, increasing strategic behavior can benefit retailers, hurt consumers, push a high-cost retailer out of the market, and lead to increasing inventory of a low-cost retailer. Increasing competition may harm the local economy, and high levels of strategic behavior may insure against oversupply that leads to clearance sales at the salvage value. The welfare-optimal number of retailers can lead to the above-cost <b>clearance</b> <b>price...</b>|$|E

40|$|Consider a {{retailer}} announces both the regular {{price and the}} post-season <b>clearance</b> <b>price</b> {{at the beginning of}} the selling season. Throughout the season, customers arrive in accord with a Poisson process. In this paper we analyze the impact of two types of customer purchasing behavior and two common in-store display formats on the retailer’s optimal expected profit and optimal order quantity. We consider the case when all customers are either myopic (purchase immediately upon arrival) or strategic (either purchase at the regular price upon arrival or attempt to purchase at the <b>clearance</b> <b>price</b> after the season ends). In addition, we consider the case when the retailer would display either all available units or one unit at a time on the sales floor. When all customers have identical valuation, we show that, in equilibrium, each strategic customer’s purchasing decision is based on a threshold policy that depends on the inventory level at the time of arrival. We prove analytically that the retailer would obtain a higher expected profit and would order more when the customers are myopic. Also, we show analytically that the retailer would earn a higher expected profit and would order more under the display one unit format when the customers are strategic. We illustrate numerically the penalty when the retailer mistakenly assumes that the strategic customers are myopic. We extend our analysis to the case in which customers belong to multiple classes, each of which has a class-specific valuation, and also to the case in which the post-season <b>clearance</b> <b>price</b> depends on the actual end-of-season inventory level...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{strategic}} customer behavior on pricing and rationing decisions of a firm selling a single product over two periods. The seller may limit {{the availability of the}} product (that is, ration) in the second(clearance) period. Some customers are strategic andrespondto the firm’s decisions by timing their purchases. When capacity is nonconstraining andthe seller has pricing flexibility, we show that rationing in the clearance periodcannot improve revenue. However, when prices are fixedin advance, rationing can improve revenue. In the latter case, we conduct a detailed analysis for linear and exponential demand curves andderive explicit expressions for optimal rationing levels. We findthat the policy of doing the better of not restricting availability at the <b>clearance</b> <b>price</b> or not offering the product at the <b>clearance</b> <b>price</b> is typically near optimal. Our analysis also suggests that rationing—although sometimes offering considerable benefit over allowing unrestrictedavailability in the clearance period—may allow the seller to obtain {{only a small fraction of}} the optimal revenue when the prices are chosen optimally without rationing. We extendthe analysis to cases where the capacity is constraining andobtain similar results. Key words: revenue management; clearance pricing; customer behavio...|$|E

The problem is exacerbated by a declining demand pattern that is less sensitive to markdowns {{towards the end of the}} selling season. In this article, we present new discrete-time models for setting <b>clearance</b> <b>prices</b> with time-dependent price sensitivity of demand. When demand is deterministic, we develop a procedure for computing optimal prices and show that decreasing price-sensitivity leads to declining prices. We also develop models with stochastic demand in which demand in different periods can be arbitrarily distributed, and obtain bounds on the optimal expected revenue and on optimal prices. A heuristic solution is proposed and its accuracy tested. We Þnd that the penalty for choosing markdown price once and keeping it unchanged for the remainder of the selling season (called the single-discount strategy) is highest when price sensitivity declines moderately in later periods. Thus, retailers are justiÞed in using a single-discount strategy both when price-sensitivity does not change appreciably over time and when it drops sharply in later periods. In virtually all cases, period-speciÞc <b>clearance</b> <b>prices</b> obtained after solving an equivalent deterministic problem lead to higher expected revenue than the optimal expected revenue of a single discount strategy.

We analyze two operating regimes.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a clearance}} pricing on daily perishable products considering a reference price of consumers. The daily perishable products are sometimes {{sold at a}} discount price before closing time to stimulate demand {{when the number of}} unsold products is more than initially envisioned. The discount pricing results both in an increase of the revenue of the day and in a decrease of the disposal cost. The discounting, however, also declines a reference price of consumers which is a mental price and serves as an anchor price to judge if a current sales price is loss or gain for the consumers. An excess discounting decreases the demand for the products sold at a regular price in the future and di-minishes long-term profit. This study conducts a mathematical analysis on the clearance pricing problem for a single period with stochastic variations both on demand and on the inventory level at clearance time. The expected profit function especially de-pends on the response of consumers to the clearing price against their reference prices. A procedure is proposed to derive an optimal <b>clearance</b> <b>price</b> when consumers are loss-neutral.

In this paper, we study the impact of quantity discounts and transportation cost structures on procurement, shipment and <b>clearance</b> <b>pricing</b> decisions through a stochastic programming with recourse formulation.

Our computational experiments suggest that it is not always necessary to select the most complex action plan.

We then identify situations where options such as markdowns and the use of quick response suppliers could be useful. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine an appropriate discount price for daily perishable products to increase profit from a long-term standpoint.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{performance}} of a stylized supply chain where two firms, a retailer and a producer, compete in a Stackelberg game. The retailer purchases a single product from the producer and afterwards sells it in the retail market at a stochastic <b>clearance</b> <b>price.</b> The retailer, however, is budget-constrained and is therefore limited in the number of units that he may purchase from the producer. We also assume that the retailer’s profit depends in part on the realized path or terminal value of some observable stochastic process. We interpret this process as a financial process such as a foreign exchange rate or interest rate. More generally the process may be interpreted as any relevant economic index. We consider a variation (the flexible contract) of the traditional wholesale price contract that is offered by the producer to the retailer. Under this flexible contract, at t = 0 the producer offers a menu of wholesale prices to the retailer, one for each realization of the financial process up to a future time τ. The retailer then commits to purchasing at time τ a variable number of units, with the specific quantity depending on the realization of the process up to time τ. Because of the retailer’s budget constraint, the supply chain might be more profitable if the retailer was able to shift some of the budget from states where the constraint is not binding to states wher...|$|E
40|$|The newsvendor {{model is}} {{designed}} to decide {{how much of a}} product to order when the product is to be sold over a short selling season with stochastic demand and there are no additional opportunities to replenish inventory. There are many practical situations that reasonably conform to those assumptions, but the traditional newsvendor model also assumes a fixed salvage value: all inventory left over {{at the end of the}} season is sold off at a fixed per-unit price. The fixed salvage value assumption is questionable when a <b>clearance</b> <b>price</b> is rationally chosen in response to the events observed during the selling season: a deep discount should be taken if there is plenty of inventory remaining at the end of the season, whereas a shallow discount is appropriate for a product with higher than expected demand. This paper solves for the optimal order quantity in the newsvendor model, assuming rational clearance pricing. We then study the performance of the traditional newsvendor model. The key to effective implementation of the traditional newsvendor model is choosing an appropriate fixed salvage value. (We show that an optimal order quantity cannot be generally achieved by merely enhancing the traditional newsvendor model to include a nonlinear salvage value function.) We demonstrate that several intuitive methods for estimating the salvage value can lead to an excessively large order quantity and a substantial profit loss. Even though the traditional model can result in poor performance, the model seems as if it is working correctly: the order quantity chosen is optimal given the salvage value inputted to the model, and the observe...|$|E
40|$|Companies {{in diverse}} {{industries}} must decide the pricing policy of their inventories over time. This decision becomes particularly complex when customers are forward looking and may defer a purchase {{in the hope}} of future discounts and promotions. With such uncertainty, many customers may end up not buying or buying at a significantly lower price, reducing the firm’s profitability. Recent studies show that a way to mitigate this negative effect caused by strategic consumers is to use a posted or preannounced pricing policy. With that policy, firms commit to a price path that consumers use to evaluate their purchase timing decision. In this paper, we propose a class of preannounced pricing policies in which the price path corresponds to a price menu contingent on the available inventory. We present a two-period model, with a monopolist selling a fixed inventory of a good. Given a menu of prices specified by the firm and beliefs regarding the number of units to be sold, customers decide whether to buy upon arrival, buy at the <b>clearance</b> <b>price,</b> or not to buy. The firm determines the set of prices that maximizes revenues. The solution to this problem requires the concept of equilibrium between the seller and the buyers that we analyze using a novel approach based on ordinary differential equations. We show existence of equilibrium and uniqueness when only one unit is on sale. However, if multiple units are offered, we show that multiple equilibria may arise. We develop a gradient-based method to solve the firm’s optimization problem and conduct a computational study of different pricing schemes. The results show that under certain conditions the proposed contingent preannounced policy outperforms previously proposed pricing schemes. The source of the improvement comes from the use of the proposed pricing policy as a barrier to discourage strategic waiting and as a discrimination tool for those customers waiting.

40|$|There is an {{essential}} need in the retail industry, of integrating inventory planning and pricing strategies. In the fast-fashion world of retail, inventory is treated as a perishable item leading to short selling periods. It is a common practice for retailers to liquidate unsold merchandise via clearance markdown policies. Joint marketing and production decisions are important and challenging in retailing. Clearance sales depend on the pricing, seasonal effects, and the assortment of goods available to the customer. Errors in inventory distribution and <b>clearance</b> <b>pricing</b> result in loss of potential revenue or excess inventory to be salvaged. In the case of Spanish-based retailer Zara, thirteen percent of annual revenues are attributed to clearance sales. To maximize these revenues a supply chain tool is designed to facilitate the inventory distribution decisions for the clearance season while considering price markdowns. A two part linear optimization model considers the demand forecast, pricing decisions, and logistic costs in determining the allocation of excess inventory. The business case {{is very similar to}} other retailers where revenues need to be maximized. However, Zara's business model and vertically integrated supply chain makes this case very unique. In a forecast error comparison test, the proposed solution improved the forecast error from 8 to 4 percent in respect to the current forecast process. by Orietta Parra Verdugo. Thesis (M. B. A.)

40|$|We {{present a}} model of timing of {{seasonal}} sales where stores choose several designs {{at the beginning of}} the season without knowing wich one, if any, will be fashionable. Fashionable designs have a chance to fetch high prices in fashion markets while non-fashionable ones must be sold in a discount market. In the beginning of the season, stores charge high prices in the hope of capturing their fashion market. As the end of the season approaches with goods still on the shelves, stores adjust downward their expectations that they are carrying a fashionable design, and may have sales to capture the discount market. Having a greater number of designs induces a store to put one of them on sales earlier to test the market. Moreover, price competition in the discount market induces stores to start sales earlier because of a greater perceived first-mover advantage in capturing the discount market. More competition, perhaps due to decreases in the cost of product innovation, makes sales occur even earlier. These results are consistent with the observation that the trend toward earlier sales since mid- 1970 's coincides with increasing product varieties in fashion good markets and increasing store competition.

In addition to power budget constraints, several (deterministic or probabilistic) interference constraints can be accommodated in the proposed general formulation, such as constraints on the maximum individual/aggregate (probabilistic) interference tolerable from the PUs. To keep the optimization as decentralized as possible, global interference constraints, when present, are imposed via pricing; the prices are thus additional variables to be optimized. The resulting players' optimization problems are nonconvex and there are <b>price</b> <b>clearance</b> conditions associated with the nonconvex global interference constraints to be satisfied by the equilibria of the game, which make {{the analysis of the}} proposed game a challenging task; none of classical results in the game theory literature can be successfully applied. To deal with the nonconvexity of the game, we introduce a relaxed equilibrium concept, the Quasi-Nash Equilibrium (QNE), and study its main properties, performance, and connection with local Nash equilibria. Quite interestingly, the proposed game theoretical formulations yield a considerable performance improvement with respect to current centralized and decentralized designs of CR systems, which validates the concept of QNE.

40|$|Retailers' {{marketing}} objectives can {{be classified}} into three broad categories: attraction effects that focus on consumers' store-entry decisions, conversion effects that relate to consumers' decisions {{about whether or not}} to make a purchase at a store they are visiting, and spending effects that represent both dollar value and composition of their transactions. This paper proposes a framework that incorporates all three of these effect categories and examines their influence on store performance. Specifically, store sales are broken down into four components: front traffic, store-entry ratio, closing ratio, and average spending. Using inexpensive and readily available infrared and video imaging technology, it is possible to measure these four components {{in a wide variety of}} retail environments, allowing retailers to obtain a richer understanding of the effectiveness of promotional activities on store sales. A set of twelve hypotheses based on the economics of information and promotion literatures is proposed. These hypotheses relate the presence of various promotions (<b>price,</b> <b>clearance,</b> and new product), promotion scope, and the type of out-of-store communication vehicle used by retailers to each of the four store sales components. The proposed approach is then applied in two different empirical settings, both to test formally the hypotheses and to demonstrate more generally the richness of the information the approach can provide. The first application involves a Canadian apparel store that sells ladies' casual wear. The second application is based on a U. S. sporting-goods retail chain that sells a variety of sporting goods, including sportswear, sports shoes, and sports equipment. A joint model of four simultaneous equations using front traffic, store traffic, number of store transactions, and store sales as the endogenous variables is then formulated for the applications. Promotional factors are used as explanatory variables, along with a number of additional control variables (including length of operation, day of week, holidays, seasonality, and weather). Seemingly unrelated regression is used to estimate the model efficiently. A comparison model that includes only store sales as the endogenous variable is estimated for comparison with the joint model. Results from these applications indicate that the proposed framework provides more detailed information about promotional effectiveness than more traditional models of store performance. The effects of specific promotional decisions on store performance are described. Specifically, price promotions have little impact on front traffic, but positively affect store entry and likelihood that a consumer will make a purchase. The effect of price promotion on consumers' spending in a store is also significant, but varies in sign with the type of promotion employed. Second, while greater promotional scope enhances store entry, promotions with narrow scope seem to have negative impact on store traffic. The effects of promotion scope on store performance also seem to be moderated by the scope of merchandise carried by the retailer. Increased promotional scope appears to have a greater effect on store traffic and consumers' spending for a multicategory retailer than for a more focused seller. Third, clearance promotions have a weaker effect on store entry when compared to other multiple-category promotions, while new-product promotions have a positive impact on conversion. Finally, newspaper advertisements, when compared to targeted coupons, have a stronger effect on store attraction but a weaker effect on spending. In addition to understanding the key drivers of store sales, retailers are also interested in determining whether or not their promotions affect store profitability. An assessment of the profit impact cannot be based on the change in overall store sales because promotions may affect various items or product categories inside a store differentially, and gross margins may not be the same for all items or categories. Although gross margin and item- or category-specific sales were not available for the two applications studied, the paper describes how such information can be integrated with the output of the proposed joint model to arrive at a richer understanding of how promotions affect overall store profitability. Finally, managerial and academic implications of this work are described, and potential extensions of the joint model are suggested.
