40|$|Administration of a {{combination}} of chloroquine and the <b>copper-lysine</b> <b>complex,</b> copper(lysine) 2, an inhibitor of microsomal monooxygenases, considerably decreased the parasitaemia level of mice infected with a chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium berghei. When given separately, chloroquine and the complex had no antimalarial effect. Use of {{a combination}} of monooxygenase inhibitors and chloroquine therefore appears to be a promising addendum to the chemotherapy of malaria caused by chloroquine-resistant parasites...|$|E
40|$|Microsomal monooxygenases, {{enzymes that}} metabolize xenobiotics, may be {{responsible}} for the chloroquine resistance of malarial parasites. Plasmodium cells contain cytochrome P- 450 and exhibit aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and aminopyrine N-dimethylase activity, two monooxygenases that inactivate chloroquine. The activities of these monooxygenases are considerably higher in chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium berghei than in the chloroquine-sensitive strain of the parasite. Inhibitors of microsomal monooxygenases have the potential to overcome the chloroquine resistance of Plasmodium spp., and, of those inhibitors tested, the <b>copper-lysine</b> <b>complex,</b> copper(lysine) 2, was the most effective...|$|E
