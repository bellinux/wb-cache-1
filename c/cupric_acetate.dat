The aqueous solution of precursors containing <b>cupric</b> chloride, antimony <b>acetate</b> and thiourea was deposited on heated glass substrates at various temperatures between 513 K to 593 K with the interval of 20 K. By using spray pyrolysis deposition method, CuSbS 2 thin films were successfully deposited on soda lime glass substrates and the influence of substrate temperature on the structural, morphological and optical properties of CuSbS 2 thin films were investigated. The GIXRD pattern showed that all the films were polycrystalline nature having (102), (111), (006) and (116) phases and the crystallinity were improved with increasing substrate temperature. The microstructure of CuSbS 2 thin films were studied by Raman spectroscopic measurement at room temperature. Surface morphology of the thin films was studied by employing Atomic Force Microscopy that revealed the average roughness decreased with increasing substrate temperature. Optical band gap of the CuSbS 2 films deposited at various temperatures was found to lie between 1. 35 - 1. 50 eV which is close to the ideal band gap for the highest conversion efficiency of solar cell...|$|R

The theory of magnetic resonance in quadrupolar nuclei is briefly described. {{followed by a}} description of the apparatus used and the experimental technique. Several computer programs were written in Elliott ALGOL 60 for the calculation and interpretation of the results. The quadrupolar coupling constant and asymmetry parameter for the methyl group deuterons in cupric acetate' were found to be :- e 2 qO/h= 55. 6 =+. 4. Khz ﬨ = 13 +. 02 at 0 ºC At 770 K the results were unchanged. The departure of ﬨ from the expected value of zero was explained {{on the basis of the}} indirect electric field effect. After a critical. review of other work on coupling constants in C-D compounds, a value of 168 ±. 5 kHz was deduced for e 2 qQ/h in the static – CD 3 group in cupric: acetate. Potassium Sulphamate –d 2 was studied at - 78 °C. The results were :- e 2 qO/h= 206. 9 + 1. 4 kHz, ﬨ=. 14 +. 01. A comparison with the results for urea showed that the magnitude and directions of the principal components of the efg tensor appeared to be controlled by hydrogen bonding. ...|$|E

For column chromatography, silica (60 to 200  μm) (Sisco Research Laboratories, Mumbai, India), and for TLC, Merck plates coated with silica gel 60, F 254 were used (Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, USA). FT-IR spectra were recorded in FT-IR- 8300 Shimadzu spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).

The spectral data were measured using TMS as the internal standard (for 1 H) and CDCl 3 (for 13 C). AAS measurements were made using Varian SpectrAA 50 B instrument (Varian Medical Systems, Melbourne, Australia).

40|$|Objective: The use of {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) {{in cancer}} {{diagnosis and treatment}} is a rapidly developing area of nanotechnology. The main objective of this research work is to synthesize copper oxide (CuO) NPs and to investigate its vitro anticancer and antibacterial property. Methods: The CuO NPs were synthesized via a facile and cost-effective precipitation method using <b>cupric</b> <b>acetate</b> (monohydrate) (CuAc 2. 2 H 2 O), sodium hydroxide, and glacial acetic acid. By varying the pH of the precursor solution, the morphology, particle size, and reaction rate of the NPs could be well tailored. The prepared CuO NPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. Results: The results revealed a well crystalline structure with leaf-like morphology. By controlling the pH of the solution, particle size and morphology of the NPs are altered. The synthesized CuO NPs have been screened for its antibacterial potency against Gram-positive (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative (Salmonella Paratyphi, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Enterobacter aerogenes) bacterial strains. The as-synthesized NPs {{were found to be}} remarkable in inhibiting pathogenic bacteria. The anticancer activity reveals the dose-dependent influence of CuO NPs against human breast cancer cell line Michigan Cancer Foundation- 7 (MCF- 7). Conclusions: The results suggested that CuO NPs have a wide range of antibacterial applications which can be used to control the spread and infection of a variety of bacterial strains. The CuO NPs showed promising anticancer activity against human breast cancer cell line (MCF- 7). Overall, CuO NPs are an effective candidate for pharmaceutical, biomedical, and environmental applications...|$|E
40|$|One of the bottle-necks in {{efficient}} {{energy recovery}} {{is attributed to}} the low thermal conductivity of common coolants. When the thermal conductivity of coolant is improved, the flow rate of coolant required and hence, energy required for pumping can be reduced. Nanofluids are novel class of fluids, prepared by dispersing nanoparticles in liquids like water, ethylene glycol-water mixture, oil etc. aimed at increasing the thermal conductivity of such coolants. In order to maximize the advantages of nanofluids, the particles chosen for dispersion must possess high thermal conductivity and maintain excellent colloidal stability. Cupric oxide has very high thermal conductivity (78 W mK - 1) {{compared to that of}} water (0. 6 W mK - 1) and hence dispersion of cupric oxide in water will serve to conserve energy. We have developed cupric oxide-water nanofluids using a two-step method. Cupric oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by reduction of <b>cupric</b> <b>acetate.</b> Scanning electron micrographs revealed the presence of needle-shaped particles of 60 nm wide and 252 nm long. These particles were dispersed using ultrasonication and by the use of Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) as dispersant. Stability was ascertained by visual observation of nanofluids stored undisturbed. The zeta potential was measured to be - 30 mV. Electrostatic repulsion and steric repulsion are expected to be responsible for colloidal stability of CuO-water nanofluids. Particles with aspect ratio > 1 provide higher enhancement in thermal conductivity as evident from Hamilton and Crosser model. Hence dispersion of these nanostructures in water will improve the thermal conductivity appreciably...|$|E
40|$|Isoprostanes F 2 are arachidonate {{autoxidation}} {{products in}} mammals {{that have been}} shown to be induced during several human disorders associated with enhanced free-radical generation. Isoprostanes F 2 represent not only extremely reliable markers of oxidative stress in vivo, but they also exert potent biological effects. Therefore, it has been postulated that isoprostanoids are mediators of oxidant injury in vivo. Higher plants, however, do not synthesize arachidonic acid or isoprostanes. Here we show that a series of isoprostane F 2 analogs termed phytoprostanes F 1 (previously dinor isoprostanes F 1) are formed by an analogous pathway from α-linolenate in plants. High-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods using [18 O] 3 phytoprostanes F 1 as internal standard have been developed to quantify phytoprostanes F 1. In fresh peppermint (Mentha piperita) leaves, phytoprostanes F 1 were found in free form (76 ng/g of dry weight) and at about 150 -fold higher levels esterified in lipids. It is notable that these levels of phytoprostanes F 1 are more than two orders of magnitude higher than the basal levels of isoprostanes F 2 in mammalian tissues. Furthermore, wounding, as well as butyl hydroperoxide or <b>cupric</b> <b>acetate</b> stress triggered a dramatic increase of free and esterified phytoprostanes F 1. Thus phytoprostanes F 1 may represent a sensitive measure of oxidative damage in plants similar to isoprostanes in mammals. However, one of the most exciting issues to be clarified is the possibility that linolenate-derived phytoprostanes F 1 exert biological activities in plants and/or animals...|$|E
