500|$|Ratchet & Clank was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews from critics upon release. After playing {{a preview of the}} game, GameSpot described it as having [...] "excellent graphics, varied gameplay, and tight control". The game's use of weapons, rather than simple melee attacks, was cited as one of the main features that made it stand out from other platform games; Computer and Video Games said that [...] "Going berserk with your giant ratchet [...] is seriously satisfying [...] Every time you thump an enemy with the hefty tool, it looks, sounds and feels remarkably solid. [...] What's more, {{the same can be said}} for all the other weapons you collect and use over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> intergalactic adventure". GameSpot noted that the player does not need to follow the same paths multiple times, as was common in platformers at the time. Gameplanet said that it was [...] "Quite simply the best platform game on the PS2 right now and possibly the best on any format!" ...|$|E
