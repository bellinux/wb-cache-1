40|$|We {{propose a}} {{theoretical}} model of 1 × 2 all-optical switching in a silicon nano-waveguide ring resonator induced by a soliton pulse. All-optical switches made by silicon fiber or silicon waveguide have attracted much attention, because the low-absorption wavelength windows of silicon material just match optical fiber communication. However, to achieve all-optical switching in silicon is challenging owing to its relatively weak nonlinear optical properties and require high switching power, {{which is much}} higher than the signal power. Such high power is inappropriate for effective on-chip integration. To overcome this limitation, we have used a highly confined nano-waveguide ring resonator structure with soliton pulse input to enhance the nonlinearity and this leads to enhance the effect of refractive index change on the transmission response. The refractive index is changed by controlling the free-carrier concentration through two-photon absorption (TPA) effect. The result indicates that a refractive index change as small as 6. 4 × 10 − 3 can reduce the switching power to 2. 38 × 10 − 6 W.

40|$|Diffusion {{effects on}} the {{stationary}} TE nonlinear surface waves and guided waves and the beam propagation characteristics at the interface separating two or more nonlinear diffusive Kerr-like media are studied extensively. The shape of the nonlinear surface and guided waves are computed for differing diffusion mechanisms and diffusion lengths. Stability of these waves is determined using the beam propagation method. The power and {{the shape of the}} nonlinear surface or guided waves are seen {{to be sensitive to the}} scaled diffusion length. However, many features including the stability criteria from the diffusionless case remain in the presence of the diffusion. An equivalent particle theory, describing the propagation of a self-focused light channel at the interface of two nonlinear dielectric media, is extended to include diffusion of the nonlinear excitation within each medium. The theory replaces the computationally intensive beam propagation problem by a much simpler Newtonian dynamical problem of studying the motion of an equivalent particle in an effective potential. This simpler Newtonian dynamical problem provides quantitative information on the asymptotes of the reflected, transmitted or trapped channels as well as the stability of the latter as a function of increasing diffusion length. The main results are that increased diffusion makes light transmission more difficult and tends to wash out the local equilibria of the equivalent potential representing unstable or stable TE nonlinear surface waves. The dynamics of two beams interacting at an interface separating two nonlinear dielectrics is studied. Using the two-soliton solution of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) and performing a perturbation analysis, ordinary differential equations (ODE) approximation for the two beam interaction dynamics are derived. The numerical results of the ODE model are verified by comparison with numerical solutions of the governing full partial differential equation (PDE). This ODE model is reduced to a simple form to carry out a useful analysis for a special case where a single beam propagating as a trapped surface wave acts as a power <b>controllable</b> <b>switch</b> to direct a second beam incident at a finite angle to the interface.

40|$|Part I: Novel soft-switching {{converters}} {{combine the}} functions of loss-less soft-switching for all switches and secondary side output voltage regulation at constant switching frequency. This {{was made possible by}} using magnetic amplifiers in series with the rectifier diodes in the symmetrical topologies. The primary side switches are driven at constant frequency and near 50 % duty ratio with small dead-time and the output voltage is regulated by pulse width modulation (PWM) control on the secondary side. All three soft-switching topologies, half-bridge, full-bridge and push-pull, are analyzed. It was found that the multiple-output extension of these converter do not have some serious adverse effects inherent to their parent PWM converters with magnetic amplifier post-regulators. Experimental results obtained on two different prototypes confirm the key advantages of the proposed soft-switching converters. Part II: Two classes of automatic current shapers are analyzed, with external and internal capacitive energy storage. The Cuk converter with Integrated Magnetics when operated in DICM with external energy storage exhibits advantages over other automatic current shaper topologies. Unity power factor is provided automatically and by using "ripple steering" mechanism essentially zero input and output current ripples are obtained for all operating conditions. Consequently, the size of the magnetics can be significantly reduced even at very modest switching frequencies. The requirement for fast output regulation implies that low-frequency energy is stored internally in the input current shaper. A new AC-to-DC converter which combines {{the functions of}} automatic current shaping, fast output voltage regulation, and loss-less soft-switching in a single converter is proposed. This was made possible through internal energy storage and discovery of the new modes of operation, which together, effectively decoupled the input boost-like part of the Cuk converter from its buck-like output. In order to keep the voltage stress on the switches low, the variable frequency control is required in addition to PWM control. Another novel class of single stage AC-to-DC converters with unity power factor and fast output regulation is also proposed. These converters use a magnetic amplifier for the input current shaping, while the active switch is used for fast output regulation. By using core material for magnetic amplifiers with high saturated permeability, and operating the input stage of the converter in DICM, the linear input inductance can be replaced by the saturated inductance of the magnetic amplifier. Thus, the magnetic amplifier combines the functions of a <b>controllable</b> <b>switch</b> and a linear inductor into a single device.

40|$|Synthesis of DC-to-DC {{converter}} topologies in the {{two largest}} families - PWM and Quasi-Resonant (QR) - is completed in this thesis In a PWM converter, two linear time-invariant networks, consisting of only capacitors and inductors, source and load, are switched at constant frequency with duty ratio D. From defining assumptions, several general properties of PWM converter networks are derived. The established general properties interrelate the number of elements, attainable DC conversion ratio M(D), and features such as continuous terminal currents or possible coupling of inductors. Based on matrix representation of the converter topology, the systematic synthesis procedure for generation of PWM converters with a given number of reactive elements is constructed. A prescribed set of requirements is the input for the procedure. The requirements may include desired DC conversion ratio, continuous terminal currents, possible coupling of inductors and a given number of switches. In particular, the number of switches implemented as transistors can be specified. Outputs of the procedure are complete classes of PWM converters that satisfy the input requirements. A number of useful PWM topologies, which have not been identified before, are uncovered. A comparison {{of members of the}} classes is included. Several extensions of PWM converters are considered, including insertion of the isolation transformer and two discontinuous operating modes for which unified DC analyses are completed. Quasi-Resonant converters are defined as two-switch PWM converter networks to which resonant elements are added. Synthesis of QR, converters is based on the recognition that there are only a finite number of topologically distinct positions for resonant elements within a two-switch PWM parent converter. If a single resonant inductor and a single resonant capacitor are added to a two-switch PWM topology, examination of all possible positions yields a total of six QR classes, which come in dual pairs. Two pairs are identified as known QR classes, namely, Zero-Current/Zero-Voltage (ZV/ZC) and Zero-Current/Zero-Voltage Quasi-Square-Wave (ZC-QSW/ZV-QSW). The remaining two classes, named Off-Resonant and On-Resonant Quasi-PWM (Q[f]-PWM/Q[n]-PWM), have not been recognized so far. The names originate from the fact that Q-PWM converters can be regarded as PWM converters operating in both discontinuous modes simultaneously. The synthesis procedure can be generalized to encompass additional resonant elements. As an example, classes of Zero-Current and Zero-Voltage Multi-Resonant (ZC-MR/ZV-MR) converters are formally defined. In contrast to square-wave switch waveforms in PWM converters, all QR topologies exhibit smooth quasi-sinusoidal waveforms and therefore reduced switching losses. Of particular interest are operating modes in which all switching transitions are at zero current or at zero voltage. A study of operating modes and a DC analysis unified with respect to all PWM parents and all topological variations are carried out for four selected classes of QR Converters - Q[n]-PWM, ZV, ZV-QSW, and ZV-MR. It is emphasized that for a QR converter, topology alone is not sufficient to derive DC conversion properties. Subject to different switch implementations and control timing, the emerging operating modes can result in vastly different behavior of the same converter topology. Two switch implementations are considered - conventional, with one <b>controllable</b> <b>switch</b> and one diode, and the one that resembles the technique of synchronous rectification - with two controllable switches. In the first case, with the exception of converters in two Q-PWM classes, only variable-frequency control is applicable. However, if both switches are controllable, constant-frequency control is restored in all QR classes, and several novel operating modes of practical interest are uncovered. Various QR classes and operating modes are compared with respect to sets of switching transitions, sensitivity to parasitic elements, available operating region, frequency range and stresses on switching devices. The role of free parameters in various design trade-offs is exposed, thus allowing a designer to select and realize the topology best suited for a particular application...|$|E

These systems with SiC power devices are more compact, lighter, and more efficient, so they are ideal for high-voltage power electronics applications, including hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) traction drives. In this paper, the effect of SiC-based power devices on HEV traction drive losses will be investigated. Reductions in heatsink size and device losses with the increase in the efficiency will be analyzed using an averaging model of a three-phase PWM inverter (TPPWMI). For more accurate results, device physics is taken into consideration to find the loss equations for the <b>controllable</b> <b>switches.</b> I...|$|R

Therefore it makes sense to compute the distance from a controllable system to the nearest uncontrollable one. In the case of a standard system, x˙t=Axt+But, R. Eising, D. Boley, and W. S. Lu obtain some results for this distance, both in the complex and real cases. In this work we explore this distance, for switched linear systems in the real case, obtaining upper bounds for it. The main contribution of the paper is to prove that a natural generalization of the upper bound obtained by D. Boley and W. S. Lu is true in the case of switched linear systems...|$|R
