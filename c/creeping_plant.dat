6000|$|... 5. Montana. D. 1201. The first really <b>creeping</b> <b>plant</b> we {{have had}} to notice. It throws out roots from the {{recumbent}} stems. Otherwise like agrestis, it has leaves like ground-ivy. Called a wood species in the text of D.|$|E
60|$|A yell of {{disappointment}} on the cliffs above accelerated their movements. It {{was evident that}} the pursuers had {{come out on the}} open plateau, but had not observed the path by which they descended. As it was certain, however, that they would find it in a few minutes, Ebony sprang upon the <b>creeping</b> <b>plant</b> and clambered along its tortuous limbs like a monkey. Young Breezy followed, and Hockins came last.|$|E
50|$|It has {{a slender}} rhizome, {{which is about}} 1.5 cm to 2 cm wide. They can form <b>creeping</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R
50|$|The former vicarage {{is a large}} house, built {{onto the}} {{fortified}} peel tower. Constructed of black basalt, it was covered with <b>creeping</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R
50|$|It has a long, stout, fleshy, light-coloured (underground) rhizome. That is 1-3 cm wide (in diameter), and {{has long}} {{secondary}} roots. It forms <b>creeping</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R
60|$|They were on {{the shady}} side of a great rock {{overhung}} by a beautiful <b>creeping</b> <b>plant,</b> and with a spring near at hand, and Yusuf, in leisurely fashion, squatted down, caused Arthur to lift out the child, who was fast asleep again, and the mules {{to be allowed to}} feed, and distributed some dried goat's flesh and dates; but Ulysse, somewhat to Arthur's alarm, did not wake sufficiently to partake.|$|E
60|$|No {{doubt the}} <b>creeping</b> <b>plant</b> would {{in a few}} seconds have {{attracted}} special attention, had not an incident turned their minds in another direction. While the foremost savage was craning his neck so as to see as far round the projecting cliff as possible, the piece of rock on which his advanced foot was dislodged, and he had the narrowest possible escape from plunging headlong after the rock, which went bounding and crashing into the gulf below.|$|E
60|$|Percy obeyed. In {{passing through}} the doorway, he {{encountered}} the bare hanging branches of some <b>creeping</b> <b>plant,</b> long since dead, and detached from its fastenings on the woodwork of the roof. He pushed aside the branches so that Charlotte could easily follow him in, without being aware that his own forced passage through them had a little deranged the folds of spotless white cambric which a well-dressed gentleman wore round his neck in those days. Charlotte seated herself, and directed Percy's attention to the desolate conservatory with a saucy smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear," [...] {{said her}} father. [...] "Green tunnels. Arched alleys covered with vines or other <b>creeping</b> <b>plants.</b> Their length was often very considerable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] {{said the}} hermit, turning {{abruptly}} {{to a small}} wooden shed which had hitherto escaped the youth's observation, so covered was it with overhanging boughs and tropical <b>creeping</b> <b>plants,</b> [...] "these are my astronomical instruments." ...|$|R
25|$|The flora of {{the high}} alti-montane grasslands is mainly tussock grass, <b>creeping</b> <b>plants,</b> and small shrubs such as ericas. These include the rare Spiral Aloe (Aloe polyphylla), which as its name {{suggests}} has leaves with a spiral shape.|$|R
60|$|They {{were both}} entirely wrong, {{although}} the mistake {{was a very}} natural one, and, in the circumstances, almost unavoidable. Constance had scrupulously observed the compact. Nothing {{could be further from}} her mind than any desire to win others to her way of thinking. The religious instinct was strong in her, and could flourish without the support of creed or doctrine; {{at the same time she}} recognised the fact that in others--in a very large majority of persons, perhaps--it is a frail <b>creeping</b> <b>plant</b> that trails along the ground to perish trodden in the dust without extraneous support.|$|E
60|$|Then very leisurely, {{as one who}} is {{sure that}} he will not be interrupted, Hokosa began to climb the tree, till at length some of the green fingers were within his reach. Resting his back against a bough, one by one he broke off several of them, and averting his face so that the fumes of it might not reach him, he caused the thick milk-white juice that they {{contained}} to trickle into the mouth of a little gourd which was hung about his neck by a string. When he had collected enough of the poison and carefully corked the gourd with a plug of wood, he descended the tree again. At the great fork where the main branches sprang from the trunk, he stood a while contemplating a <b>creeping</b> <b>plant</b> which ran up them. It was a plant of naked stem, like the tree it grew upon; and, also like the tree, its leaves consisted of bunches of green spikes having a milky juice.|$|E
60|$|Entering {{the gate}} and passing the shrubs, the {{silhouette}} of a house rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone nowhere. All was obscurity. Were the inmates retired to rest? I feared it must be so. In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the growth of ivy or some other <b>creeping</b> <b>plant,</b> whose leaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set. The aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage shooting over it, I could see all within. I could see clearly a room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat-fire. I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs. The candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean, like all about her, was knitting a stocking.|$|E
50|$|It has a small, {{compact and}} stout rhizome, {{which is about}} 2 cm in diameter. They are very similar in form to Iris susiana. They form <b>creeping</b> <b>plants,</b> that can spread up to 1 or 2 feet wide.|$|R
50|$|The flora of {{the high}} alti-montane grasslands is mainly tussock grass, <b>creeping</b> <b>plants,</b> and small shrubs such as ericas. These include the rare Spiral Aloe (Aloe polyphylla), which as its name {{suggests}} has leaves with a spiral shape.|$|R
60|$|Negore {{looked at}} it shortly and carelessly. It was a vast slide that broke the {{straight}} wall of a cliff, and was overrun with brush and <b>creeping</b> <b>plants,</b> where a score of tribes could have lain well hidden.|$|R
60|$|With {{increasing}} anxiety I hastened on, {{when all}} at once a low growl issuing from the bushes some yards ahead of me brought me to a stop. In a moment the dogs, Susio and Goloso, rushed out from some hiding place furiously barking; but they quickly recognized me and slunk back again. Relieved from fear, I walked on for a short distance; then {{it struck me that}} the old man must be about somewhere, as the dogs scarcely ever stirred from his side. Turning back, I went to the spot where they had appeared to me; and there, after a while, I caught sight of a dim, yellow form as one of the brutes rose up to look at me. He had been lying on the ground by the side of a wide-spreading bush, dead and dry, but overgrown by a <b>creeping</b> <b>plant</b> which had completely covered its broad, flat top like a piece of tapestry thrown over a table, its slender terminal stems and leaves hanging over the edge like a deep fringe. But the fringe did not reach to the ground and under the bush, in its dark interior. I caught sight of the other dog; and after gazing in for some time, I also discovered a black, recumbent form, which I took to be Nuflo.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the next}} day dawned, and the sun rose high, and the world was well heated and aired before the bushmen condescended to appear. After a two hours' battle with the sand-flies we set off at 7.35 A.M., Forteune, Hotaloya, and Kángá {{at the head of}} the musketeers, one of them also {{carrying}} an axe; sixteen guns form a strong party for these regions. The viol (nchámbí) was not allowed to hang mute in Mbata's halls, this instrument or the drum must never be neglected in African travel; its melody at the halt and the camp-fire are to the negro what private theatricals are to the European sailor half fossilized in the frozen seas. Our specimen was strung with thin cords made from the fibre of a lliana; I was shown this growth, which looked much like a convolvulus. The people have a long list of instruments, and their music, though monotonous, is soft and plaintive: Bowdich gives a specimen of it ("Sketch of Gaboon," [...] p. 449), and of a bard who seems to have been somewhat more frenzied than most poets. Captain Allen (iii. 398) speaks of a harp at Bimbia (Camarones) tightly strung with the hard fibre of some <b>creeping</b> <b>plant.</b> The Bákele harp (M. du Chaillu, chap, xvi.) is called Ngombi; the handle opposite the bow often has a carved face, and it might be a beginning of the article used by civilized Europe-- Wales for instance.|$|E

60|$|Twilight {{was closing}} on the diminished autumn day. The schoolroom windows--darkened with <b>creeping</b> <b>plants,</b> from which no high October winds had as yet swept the sere foliage--admitted scarce a gleam of sky; but the fire gave {{light enough to}} talk by.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the growth performance and field evaluation of the dual herbicide-resistant transgenic <b>creeping</b> bentgrass <b>plants.</b> The effect of glyphosate treatment on the herbicide resistance of the transgenic <b>creeping</b> bentgrass <b>plants</b> was determined, and the non-transgenic control plant withered at the concentration 11 μg/mL or higher whereas the transgenic <b>creeping</b> bentgrass <b>plants</b> survived the treatment at the concentration of 3, 000 μg/mL, and the increase of the plant length was repressed as the glyphosate treatment concentration was increased. At field evaluation, glufosinate-ammonium and glyphosate were simultaneously treated to investigate the weed control effect. The results showed that more than 90 % of the weeds withered four week after herbicide treatment, while the transgenic <b>creeping</b> bentgrass <b>plants</b> continued to grow normally. Therefore, the dual herbicide-resistant <b>creeping</b> bentgrass <b>plants</b> {{may be able to}} greatly contribute to the efficiency of weed control and to the economic feasibility of mowing in places such as golf courses...|$|R
60|$|He ushered {{his guest}} {{into a small}} room the windows of which were darkened by the <b>creeping</b> <b>plants</b> that {{clustered}} round them. Entering, and closing the door, the two gazed at each other a little space without speaking. The traveller first broke silence.|$|R
5000|$|Japanese: amachazuru (kanji: hiragana: あまちゃずる; {{literally}} 甘いamai=sweet, tasty 茶 cha=tea, 蔓 zuru=vine, <b>creeping</b> <b>plant)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|It has a small, red rhizome, {{which is}} about 1 cm long, and medium thick. Underneath the rhizome are long {{secondary}} roots. The rhizome and roots make a <b>creeping</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Manto de la Virgen is a plant {{of rocky}} coastlines, {{especially}} on Cabrera, Formentera, Ibiza, and Majorca of the islands. It is a <b>creeping</b> <b>plant</b> and has star-shaped, 5-narrow petal, violet to light violet flowers.|$|E

40|$|This {{is a short}} account on {{the coastal}} dune {{vegetation}} of the Gulf of Siam in Thailand. Vegetation is mainly composed by succulent <b>creeping</b> <b>plants</b> with herbaceous habit as to Canavalia maritima (Papilionaceae) and Iponwea pes-caprae (Convolvulaceae) and the robust stoloniferous grass Spinijex littoreus, the last having an important function for the fonnation of coastal dunes...|$|R
50|$|Haplocarpha rueppellii is a <b>creeping</b> {{perennial}} <b>plant</b> {{that can}} grow into dense mats.|$|R
50|$|It has a thick, short, irregularly shaped, fibrous rhizome. They are 0.5 - 1.5 cm in diameter. Under the rhizome, are {{numerous}} yellow-white, secondary roots. On {{top of the}} rhizome, are the brown, fibrous remains of old leaves. The rhizome has many branches, creating a slowly, <b>creeping</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
50|$|During Sachet's {{visit in}} 1958, the {{vegetation}} {{was found to}} consist of a sparse cover of spiny grass and low thickets, a <b>creeping</b> <b>plant</b> (Ipomoea sp.), and stands of coconut palm. This low-lying herbaceous flora seems to be pioneer in nature, {{and most of it}} is believed to be composed of recently introduced species. Sachet suspected that Heliotropium curassavicum and possibly Portulaca oleracea were native (Sachet 1962).|$|E
50|$|Leiomitra julacea is a spongy plant {{appearing}} like {{a mass of}} interwoven cilia. It is <b>creeping</b> <b>plant,</b> chocolate brown, with shoots up to 2 mm wide. Leaves spread widely {{but with}} the lobes arching sharply toward the shoot apex. Leaf disc 5-6 cells high. The only other species of Leiomitra found in New Zealand, L. lanata, is yellow-green with the disc 6-10 cells high.|$|E
50|$|The park {{offers a}} playground, a picnic area, and hiking and biking trails. A picnic shelter with {{bathrooms}} {{is located in}} the picnic area. Along the cliff line are several varieties of rare ferns, along with <b>creeping</b> <b>plants</b> and wild flowers. The beauty of the area made it a popular tourist destination even before Manitowoc County acquired the property in 1963.|$|R
50|$|They form low, rounded or <b>creeping</b> <b>plants,</b> {{typically}} 5-20 cm tall. The {{leaves are}} smoothly rounded, roughly spoon-shaped (the scientific name Cochlearia {{derives from the}} Latinized form, cocleare, of the Greek κοχλιάριον, kokhliárion, a spoon; this a diminutive of κόχλος, kókhlos, seashell), or in some species, lobed; typically 1-5 cm long, and with a fleshy texture. The flowers are white with four petals and are borne in short racemes.|$|R
6000|$|His triumph, however, was short-lived, for at a {{turn in the}} glade {{he came to a}} {{place where}} the {{underwood}} was so dense and so interlaced with vines and <b>creeping</b> <b>plants</b> that further advance was absolutely impossible. After [...] "yawing about" [...] for some minutes [...] "in search of a channel," [...] as Larry expressed it, Muggins suddenly gave in and exclaimed,--"I'm a Dutchman, boys, if we ha'n't got embayed!" ...|$|R
