40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find scientific arguments in favour of reusing recovered oak wood in order to reintegrate it in new types of structures. For this study six beams were selected, which had been recovered from a house built in 1831. Visual analysis revealed several defects and signs of degradation in the sapwood and inside the cracks. The recovered beams hadn’t been treated with any toxic <b>chemicals.</b> <b>Bending</b> strength, modulus of elasticity and compression strength parallel to the grain were investigated and microscopy and FTIR-ATR spectroscopy were used to check the quality of the apparently sound beam areas also used for the determination of mechanical properties. Macroscopic and microscopic analysis may not reveal any incipient fungal attack but FTIR analysis was proven to be effective. The obtained results open a new perspective for the future use of recovered old oak wood, due to the adequate mechanical properties and to the assumed means of eliminating degraded areas...|$|R

For this purpose, sodium hydroxide + hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydroxide + calcium hydroxide + hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid were applied to pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky), ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) and oak (Quercus petraea spp.) for bleaching. The results indicate that the hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid solutions caused the greatest decrease in the bending strength of the woods used in the experiment...|$|R

Experiments show that sub-millimeter bending radii are achieved using a splayed molecular orientation.

LCS and MRS {{did not significantly}} influence the calibration performance for any wood property. The regression coefficients also showed no clear differences {{for any of the}} conditions. This indicates that the important explanatory variables included in the models are not greatly influenced by these measurement conditions. PLS 2 analysis results, when presented graphically, allowed easy interpretation of the relationships between wood mechanical properties and <b>chemical</b> components, e.g., <b>bending</b> strength and stiffness were mainly related to polysaccharides cellulose and hemicellulose.

40|$|Stimuli-sensitive hydrogels {{have been}} intensively studied {{because of their}} {{potential}} applications in drug delivery, cell culture, and actuator design. Although hydrogels with directed unidirectional response, i. e. capable of bending actuated by different chemical components reaction in response to several stimuli including water and electric fields, these hydrogels are capable of being actuated in one direction only by the stimulus. By contrast the challenge of building a device {{that is capable of}} responding to the same cue (in this case a temperature gradient) to bend in either direction remains unmet. Here, inspired by the structure of pine cone scales, we design a temperature-sensitive hydrogel with bending directed an imposed fishing line. The layers with same PNIPAAm always shrinks in response to the heat. Even the layers made with different <b>chemical</b> property, <b>bends</b> away from a warm surface, whether the warm surface is applied at its upper or lower boundary. To design the bending hydrogel we exploited the coupled responses of the hydrogel; a fishing line intercalating structure and change its construction. In addition to revealing a new capability of stimulus sensitive hydrogels, our study gives insight into the structural features of pine cone bending...|$|R
40|$|In the {{presented}} {{work the}} influence of <b>chemical</b> treatment on <b>bending</b> and torsional rigidity of flax and hemp fibres was studied. The morphological properties, bending and torsional rigidity of bast fibres before and after chemical treatment were investigated. Method of double pendulum for determination of fibre bending rigidity and method of torsional pendulum for determination of fibre torsional rigidity were adapted to the investigation of bast fibre rigidities. During the investigations the mean periods of pendulum vibration in bending (Tg) and in torsion (Tt) were measured. On {{the basis of these}} periods the mean bending and torsional rigidities were calculated as well as coefficients of variation of the periods. It was shown that the adapted methods are useful for bast fibre rigidities investigations and that the applied chemical treatment lead to decreasing of bending and torsional rigidities of the studied fibres...|$|R
30|$|The {{field of}} {{nanotechnology}} has grown discernible, because {{of research that}} was undertaken in carbon nanotubes (CNTs), especially on synthesizing different allotropes of carbon nanomaterials, like carbon nanorings [1], carbon nanorods [2], carbon nanosphere [3], etc. Following CNTs, the single-walled carbon nanorings (SWCNRs) and multi-walled carbon nanorings (MWCNRs) {{are found to be}} the most interesting carbon nanostructure, since they are considered as the giant of all carbon structure and directly used as a nanoscale device [4]. Recently, several research groups have reported on modifying the as-synthesized CNTs into the formation of the ring-shaped carbon tube via post-treatment processes [5 - 7]. Mostly, the post-treatment process involves <b>chemical</b> treatment to <b>bend</b> the CNTs into the ring shape and structure, which might alter the essential characteristics of nanotubes [8]. To overcome these problems, it is, indeed, necessary to synthesize carbon nanorings (CNR) in the as-synthesized condition itself.|$|R
40|$|Aerocoat AR- 7 is a coating {{that has}} been used to protect {{stainless}} steel flex hoses at NASA's Kennedy Space Center launch complex and hydraulic lines of the mobile launch platform (MLP). This coating has great corrosion control performance and low temperature application. AR- 7 was developed by NASA and produced exclusively for NASA but its production has been discontinued due to its high content of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and significant environmental impact. The purpose of this project was to select and evaluate candidate coatings to find a replacement coating that is more environmentally friendly, with similar properties to AR- 7. No coatings were identified that perform the same as AR- 7 in all areas. Candidate coatings failed in comparison to AR- 7 in salt fog, beachside atmospheric exposure, pencil hardness, Mandrel <b>bend,</b> <b>chemical</b> compatibility, adhesion, and ease of application tests. However, two coatings were selected for further evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 89 - 90) This research {{presents the}} key elements for designing a fiber optic sensing interface used in medical device applications where low power requirements are needed. The goal is to identify the major areas in which signal throughput is most affected. In order to classify the best design fit for use in medical devices, many considerations are taken due to the rigorous regulatory requirements. Signal throughput is the ultimate goal {{but there are many}} other factors such as biocompatibility, safety, tolerancing and many others. Fiber optic samples were tested thoroughly in the following ways: optical fiber types, <b>chemical</b> resistance, fiber <b>bend</b> radius, length vs signal, and material. All tests were done in the visible light spectrum from 430 nm- 700 nm wavelengths. The fiber samples were also tested using various connector methods. A comparison analysis was conducted for fiber to fiber and lens to fiber configurations. This is of significant importance because fiber optic cable loss is highest at its connection interfaces. The overall intent is to find the optimal connector configuration for low emission signals collected through optical fibers...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The exact {{composition}} and material {{properties of the}} metal alloys used in orthodontics are usually not identified by or even available from manufacturers. This makes meaningful comparisons between wires impossible and is unacceptable with regard to biocompatibility issues. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the material characteristics of contemporary stainless steel (SS) and beta-titanium (beta-Ti) wires, also known as titanium-molybdenum alloy (TMA), for comparison. Methods: Twenty-two different SS and beta-Ti wires, preferably straight wires sized 0. 43 X 0. 64 mm, (0. 017 x 0. 025 in) were tested blindly for wire dimensions, <b>chemical</b> compositions, <b>bending</b> and tensile properties, and surface characteristics. Results: Four chemical compositions were found for the beta-Ti wires: titanium- 11. 5, molybdenum- 6, zirconium- 4. 5 tin; titanium- 3, aluminum- 8, vanadium- 6, chromium- 4, molybdenum- 4, zirconium; titanium- 6, aluminum- 4, vanadium, and titanium- 45 niobium. The SS wires were of AISI type 304 or the nickel-free variant BioDur 108. All beta-Ti wires showed high surface roughness values. TMA 02 significantly had the highest E-modulus, TMA 02 and TMA 11 had the highest 0. 2 % yield strength, TMA 02 had the highest hardness, and TMA 12 was the most ductile wire of the beta-Ti wires. All SS wires showed high 0. 2 % yield strength, SS 10 significantly had the lowest E-modulus and was the most ductile wire, and SS 08 significantly showed the lowest hardness values of all SS wires. Conclusions: Significant differences were found between SS and beta-Ti wires, but there was little or no difference between the mechanical and physical characteristics tested in each subgroup. However, the morphological analysis clearly demonstrated that the finishing phase (annealing, polishing) of the wires' production process lacks the quality one would expect with regard to good mechanical properties and biocompatibility issues. Accurate specifications are urgently needed concerning the quality of orthodontic wires on the market. status: publishe...|$|R
