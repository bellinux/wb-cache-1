2500|$|Cantinieau {{went to the}} Société Matra {{to build}} a two seat development, the MC-101. [...] This was also an open steel tube design, more complex {{particularly}} in the tail boom, though the undercarriage was reduced to simple skids [...] apart. [...] It had a [...] Hirth HM-504 engine, enclosed in a long, smooth nosed but partially open sided cowling, driving the oscillating rotor hub via a 41:6 reduction gearbox, clutch and Paulstra universal joint. The rotor blades were machined from duralumin. A three blade tail rotor was driven via another Paulstra joint and <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The design {{specifically}} includes {{features for}} safety, reliability and appearance. In place of <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> drives to the wheels, coupling rods {{were used to}} give people something to watch and engine covers were omitted to give {{a good view of}} the Rolls-Royce diesel engines. The full-length canopy above the engine covers not only adds to the distinctive outline but also supports the exhaust silencer. For added safety with only one man in the cab, a dead-man device is included, a pedal that when released triggers the braking system to bring the train safely to a halt. The turbocharged six-cylinder engine is rated at [...] and drives through a hydraulic transmission that has only one drive ratio. The result is a locomotive that accelerates quickly up to speed. All four locomotives were rebuilt in 2012–13 in readiness for the launch of the new [...] "traditional diesel" [...] service.|$|E

50|$|In 1965 native {{locomotive}} production {{began to}} use <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> {{as part of the}} transmission system.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> {{are also}} {{often used in}} marine {{applications}} between the transmission and either a propeller gearbox or waterjet.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} has {{a diesel}} powertrain, using hydraulic transmission, with both bogies driven by <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts,</b> and all wheels powered.|$|R
50|$|This {{arrangement}} was only fitted to one bogie, {{the other one}} retaining its normal drive but with the <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> disconnected.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> failure {{led to an}} {{incident}} at [...] on 10 April 2011, injuring {{a member of the}} public with a piece of ballast kicked up by the detached shaft.|$|E
5000|$|Transmission/Gearbox: Carbon-fiber <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> 3-disc carbon-fiber clutch {{supplied}} by Sandtler (2000-2006), mechanically operated via a foot-operated pedal, standardized Xtrac 6-speed manual transmission with sequential gearshift, transaxle configuration with mechanical differential lock Rear-wheel drive without acceleration skid control ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> {{are used}} in some diesel {{locomotives}} (mainly diesel-hydraulics, such as British Rail Class 52) and some electric locomotives (e.g. British Rail Class 91). They are also widely used in diesel multiple units.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} Yhteissisu production {{was dependent on}} availability of German components; gearboxes and steering gears were from ZF, rims from Kronprinz, <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> from Rheinmetall and Bosch supplied electrical equipment. These were later replaced by number of domestic options. The gearboxes were produced by Rosenlew, electrical equipment came from Strömberg, Hackman & Co. made rims, Fiskars produced leaf springs, the engines were made by SAT and Tampereen Pellava- ja Rautateollisuus, of which the latter one produced also front axles. Valtion lentokonetehdas made cabins and <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts,</b> Valtion Tykkitehdas steering gears, rear axle housings and wheel hubs came from Ahlström, drive shafts from Lokomo and rubber parts, including tyres, from Suomen Gummitehdas.|$|R
5000|$|The B′B′ or B-B {{arrangement}} is similar, but usually applies to diesel-hydraulic locomotives rather than diesel-electrics. The axles on each bogie are coupled together mechanically, {{rather than being}} driven by individual traction motors. Diesel-hydraulics have their engine mounted on the main frame of the locomotive, together with a hydraulic transmission. Power is then transmitted to the bogies by <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> and a short driveshaft between axles.|$|R
50|$|The power {{transmission}} is mechanical. It provides a constant transmission of torque {{from the engine}} to all the wheels. The {{power transmission}} comprises the following: gearbox, transfer box, wheel reducers, front and rear main transmissions, and <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{general design}} of a CR-8 {{locomotive}} was available in weights from 45 to 65 ST with installed power ranging from , using twin engines with hydraulic transmission via a <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> final drive, in gauges from [...] to [...]|$|E
50|$|A drive shaft, driveshaft, driving shaft, {{propeller}} shaft (prop shaft), or <b>Cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> is a mechanical component for transmitting torque and rotation, usually used to connect other {{components of a}} drive train that cannot be connected directly because of distance or the need to allow for relative movement between them.|$|E
40|$|Subject of investigation: {{parameters}} governing {{safety of}} the operators of potato combines KKU- 2 A during normal operation in Bryansk region. Purpose of the work: enhancement of the {{safety of the}} mechanization equipment operators by minimization of dangerous situations and improvement of the design of anti-winding devices of <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> {{on the basis of the}} labour protection technical principles which consist in the protection by time and use of interlocks. The results of the work provide for models and algorithms for safety of the mechanization equipment operators, the statistics of processes governing the safety, the engineer and technical safety facilities and the methods for their calculation. The developed models and algorithms can be used when projecting safety systems for the mobile equipment operators in the zone of <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> and the developed design models of the protective devices given three author's certificates effectively preclude traumas.

50|$|A similar wheel arrangement, {{with five}} axles across two bogies, {{is also used}} in Japan for the Class DE10, DE11, and DE15 locomotives. As these are diesel-hydraulic locomotives, they are of C-B arrangement, not Co-Bo. A {{hydrodynamic}} transmission on the locomotive frame {{is driven by the}} prime mover, then drive to each bogie is taken by <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts.</b> The axles of each bogie are all driven, and all geared together, rather than having traction motors.|$|R
40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that natural resources are becoming increasingly scarce. Consequently, whenever possible in the machine element manufacture, metallic materials should be replaced with new artificial materials. This paper studies the possibility of replacing two <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> of a truck TURBO ZETA 85. 14 B with one shaft made of aluminium and a composite material, while the basic requirements concerning the given load transfer and fundamental natural frequencies remain satisfied...|$|R
50|$|Only {{one type}} was made, a two-seater, {{and it is}} thought that only 14 were sold. The car was powered by a single cylinder, 1180 cc, 8 hp De Dion engine at the rear driving through a <b>Cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> which was unusual in those days when chain drive was more common.|$|E
50|$|The {{motorcycles}} {{were made}} in several models ranging from 98 cc two stroke to 750 cc overhead valve four cylinder engines. There were also one and two cylinder models, with a sheet metal frame and <b>Cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> final drive. Dollar made its own engines, but also used Chaise overhead valve engines.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of track machines are {{powered by a}} diesel engine. This provides power to the driving wheels via either a hydrostatic circuit or <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft,</b> allowing the machine to propel itself to and around a work-site. The engine also drives a hydraulic pump to provide power for the various tools.|$|E
5000|$|The {{locomotives}} were {{variants of}} the standard MaK G1200 series design, and are considered a development of the MaK G1205 type. The locomotive is an off-centre cab design with a two-speed voith hydraulic transmission driving all axles via <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts.</b> Auxiliary electrical supply is provided by an engine mounted alternator. Unlike many other MaK locomotives which use a MTU or CAT 12-cylinder V engine the locomotive has an ABC 6-cylinder inline engine.|$|R
5000|$|Small {{shunting}} locomotives {{were assigned}} the number [...] "3". The second number indicates {{the engine power}} (according to 1955 standards). The third number differentiates between brakes and transmission (chain drive or <b>Cardan</b> <b>shafts).</b> Small locomotives of the former Ka series were given the new class numbers 381 (pre-war models) and 382 (new models). The existing narrow gauge locomotives of the Wangerooge Island Railway became Class 329. In 1987 the DB Class 260/261 were also assigned to the small locomotives and labelled as Class 360/361.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the series as {{fundamentally}} {{the same as the}} rest of the V 160 family: all four axles are driven via <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> by a Voith two speed hydraulic transmission which in turn is driven by a diesel engine, fuel and oil are located between the bogies under the main frame, on either side of the centrally located transmission, there are two cabs (which have slightly different windows). Externally the machines are very similar to the other members of the class, being of the longer variant at 16.4 m.|$|R
50|$|At {{each end}} {{there was an}} {{identical}} motor installation with Ford petrol engines, that drove the first axle via a four-geared drive and <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft.</b> Only the front motor facing the direction of travel was used and was operated by the driver's cab at that end. When shunting or if an engine failed, the railbus could also be driven in reverse.|$|E
50|$|All the {{vehicles}} were 2 axle bogieless designs {{with the exception}} of the original Tram number 101 which had a double bogie. No.101 was sold in 1916 to Erith Urban District Council. It was replaced by another Tram 101 delivered in 1923 which was an experimental design designed by the company's manager E S Rayner with <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> drive to split axles via a differential.|$|E
50|$|The {{transporters}} models feature similar configuration. Both {{units are}} basically sealed all-welded structures.The vehicle power plant is arranged {{in the first}} van behind the driver's cabin. From a 12-cylinder multi-fuel engine the torque is conveyed to a hydro-mechanical transmission via a <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> and further to the bevel gearing and final drive units, {{as well as to}} the drive sprockets of the first and second van bodies.|$|E
50|$|In September 1944 Rheinmetall-Borsig {{became an}} {{external}} camp for Buchenwald concentration camp. As many as 1,294 female prisoners {{were made to}} do forced labour there, most of them aged between 16 and 60, many Jews from Hungary. As well as continuing to produce <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts,</b> the women also helped make parts for armoured vehicles used in the war, as well as manufacturing arms; two new workshops were built for this in 1944 and 1945. The SS evacuated the camp in early April 1945, sending its prisoners and SS overseers on a death march, which ended near Pilsen, Czechoslovakia.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} applied modern design {{principles to}} a shunter {{designed for the}} UK market; the locomotive has swing arm/coil spring suspension, with vertical hydraulic damping, and pneumatic brakes. The transmission is via a hydrodymamic converter and <b>cardan</b> drive <b>shafts</b> to right angled gearbox drives on each axle.|$|R
25|$|The 2600s {{shared the}} engines and {{transmission}} of their GNR(I) predecessors, having two , 9.6-litre, six-cylinder, four-stroke engines driving the inner axles {{of the two}} bogies via fluid flywheels and Self-Changing Gears five-speed preselector gearboxes, with <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> driving forward/reverse gearboxes {{on the ends of}} the axles. Multiple working was via 24-core jumper cables. The cars were fitted with two parallel vacuum brake systems—a conventional system and a second high-vacuum, quick-release system, based on reservoirs in which a vacuum was continually maintained, for use on services with frequent stops. Steam heating was originally fitted; even-numbered cars had a boiler in the guard's compartment, capable of supplying steam for up to four cars. Cars used on suburban services were subsequently fitted with a bus-type heating system that utilised the engines' cooling water.|$|R
50|$|The main {{concept of}} the {{universal}} joint {{is based on the}} design of gimbals, which have been in use since antiquity. One anticipation of the universal joint was its use by the ancient Greeks on ballistae. In Europe the universal joint is often called the Cardano joint or <b>Cardan</b> <b>shaft,</b> after the Italian mathematician Gerolamo Cardano; however, in his writings, he mentioned only gimbal mountings, not universal joints.|$|E
50|$|The {{trainsets}} are 4-unit {{multiple units}} capable of operating in pairs, designed for medium-distance high-speed services. The inner axle of each carriage bogie {{is powered by}} a body mounted three phase asynchronous traction motor via a <b>cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> final drive. The electrical power is regulated by IGBT devices with one converted per carriage. The bogies are of welded steel construction with primary coil springs and secondary air suspension. Tractive forces are transmitted by a drag pivot pin.|$|E
50|$|Cardano {{partially}} invented {{and described}} several mechanical devices including the combination lock, the gimbal consisting of three concentric rings allowing a supported compass or gyroscope to rotate freely, and the <b>Cardan</b> <b>shaft</b> with universal joints, {{which allows the}} transmission of rotary motion at various angles and is used in vehicles to this day. He {{made significant contributions to}} hypocycloids, published in De proportionibus, in 1570. The generating circles of these hypocycloids were later named Cardano circles or cardanic circles and were used for the construction of the first high-speed printing presses.|$|E
50|$|In 2013 the PLA {{was able}} to obtain a set of Krauss Maffei trucks from a retired Plasser and Theurer ballast {{cleaning}} machine from France. In 2015, they purchased replacement <b>cardan</b> <b>shafts</b> made by the Welte group in Germany. These two developments meant that if the rear Maybach could be made operational {{that it would be}} possible for SP 9010 to operate under its own power. On February 14, 2017, the rear MD870 Maybach V-16 diesel engine was successfully started after being unused for 48 years. It ran for about 16 minutes; the engine was turned off, then turned back on for 2 minutes with no problems both static runs, and with a clean exhaust. On March 1, 2017, SP 9010 operated under its own power for the first time, on the Niles Canyon Railway.|$|R
