40|$|The abundances {{of noble}} gases found in primitive, {{carbonaceous}} meteorites are unexpected {{when compared with}} our Sun. Known as Q-gases (Q for some unknown carrier dubbed quintessence), this anomaly has remained a mystery since it was discovered in 1975. Q-gases are characterized by increasing depletions with decreasing atomic number (Z) relative to solar noble gases and normalized to 132 Xe (Figure 1). This Q-gas mass fractionation is unexplained, and its investigation is important to understanding {{the origin of the}} solar system. However, the subject is fraught with controversy, in part due to the complex nature of Q and in part due to claims of some researchers that cannot be reproduced by other investigators. The topic is discussed in numerous places [e. g., 1 - 4], with models of Q falling into two basic categories, both involving <b>carbon</b> <b>entrapment</b> of noble gases. First (Group A), there is the conservative two-dimensional view that Q-gases are adsorbed or sorbed onto a "labyrinth" of graphite or carbon grains [5 - 9], or they undergo active capture onto growing surfaces [6]. Second (Group B), there is the view holding to the remarkable property of carbon discovered in 1985. Carbon can curl up into closed geometries of hexagon- and pentagon-shaped carbon-ring configurations, a property ignored completely by Group A. Group B thinks of Q as a three-dimensional structure of endohedral carbon cages like fullerenes, carbon onions, or some class of carbon nanotubes [3, 4, 10]. Group B does not exclude Group A effects...|$|E
40|$|Clinically {{significant}} {{carbon dioxide}} embolism {{is a rare}} but potentially fatal complication of anesthesia administered during laparoscopic surgery. Its most common cause is inadvertent injection of carbon dioxide into a large vein, artery or solid organ. This error usually occurs during or shortly after insufflation of carbon dioxide into the body cavity, but may result from direct intravascular insufflation of carbon dioxide during surgery. Clinical presentation of carbon dioxide embolism ranges from asymptomatic to neurologic injury, cardiovascular collapse or even death, which {{is dependent on the}} rate and volume of <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>entrapment</b> and the patient's condition. We reviewed extensive literature regarding carbon dioxide embolism in detail and set out to describe the complication from background to treatment. We hope that the present work will improve our understanding of carbon dioxide embolism during laparoscopic surgery...|$|R
40|$|Enzyme catalyzed biofuel {{cells have}} been {{proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} transition metal catalysts for power generation as they oxidize alcohols at relatively low overpotential without the production of detrimental carbon monoxide, and are capable of operation at lower temperatures [Palmore GT, Bertschy H, Bergens SH, Whitesides GM. A methanol/dioxygen biofuel cell that uses NAD() -dependent dehydrogenase as catalysts: application of an electro-enzymatic method to regenerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide at low overpotentials. J Electroanal Chem 1998; 443 : 155 - 61]. Additionally, the immobilization procedure prevents internal leakage or cross-contamination of electron mediators. However, full realization of the membrane-less biofuel cell as a power source requires a three-dimensional boundary structure which balances the overall effective surface area against porosity, thus ensuring the maximum number of catalyst sites are available without suffering the blockage of fuel transport, which occurs if the pore size is too small. In this work, a simple and in situ method using a simplified diffusion model is presented to estimate the total activity immobilized enzyme in the absence of mass transfer effects. The method, which also calculates a combined mass transfer parameter including an effective diffusion coefficient, models the reactant concentration at the enzyme surface using bulk concentrations which then can be measured in situ by spectrophotometric detection or ex situ by HPLC analysis. The method was then applied to evaluate two methods of alcohol dehydrogenase electrode fabrication: direct adsorption to <b>carbon</b> felt and <b>entrapment</b> within the conductive polymer polypyrrole. Results showed that direct adsorption provided 26 times the activity versus the method of direct entrapment and better mass transfer characteristics. Correlation of these results to scanning electron micrographs suggested that the polypyrrole entrapment method lacked the expected diffusive pathways and most likely expelled enzyme during growth of the film.
