This special category of wastes was maintained until further human health and environmental risk assessments could be completed. As per this deferral, the six categories of special waste are 1) Cement kiln dust, 2) Mining waste, 3) oil and gas drilling muds and oil production brines, 4) beneficiation and processing waste from phosphate rock mining, 5) uranium waste, and 6) utility or fossil fuel combustion waste. The difference between special wastes and other wastes is the large volume of generation of special waste at a time leading to less human and environmental risk.|$|E

This study uses the seven wastes approach from lean theory to classify <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> in fresh food supply chains and to identify at which stage of the supply chain waste occur.

Posted with permission by The Johns Hopkins University Press. This article investigates the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> and its ideological function within Victorian political ecology. It seeks to draw out the connections between conceptions of nature, understandings of technology, and political economy in mid-Victorian capitalist ideology. It does so through a detailed reading of the corpus of one Victorian writer and commentator on technological subjects, Peter Lund Simmonds. Simmonds is interesting both as an everyday producer of knowledge about science and technology, and because he explicitly draws on the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> {{as a condition of}} possibility for technological progress and civilization. Ultimately he is indicative of the continuing strength of cornucopian ideas of nature among ideologues of capitalist improvement in the mid-Victorian period, which suggests the limited metropolitan influence of any emerging conservationism or "green imperialism. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{paper by}} the authors {{presented}} at IGLC 21 in 2013 concluded that the classical list of seven wastes presented by Ohno is context specific (related to mass production) {{and that there is}} a need for the creation of a list specific for construction. The present paper presents a draft of such a list. The draft list is constructed in compliance with the Transformation – Flow – Value theory of production. Three main <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> are established: Material waste, time loss and value loss. The first is related to the transformation perspective, the second to the flow perspective and the third to the value perspective. Making do, buffering and task diminishment are not included as such in the proposed taxonomy. The paper therefore discusses how these phenomena relate to the <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> in the proposed taxonomy. A taxonomy of waste must be based on an explicit definition of the term waste. The two terms value and waste are tightly interconnected. Although value and waste are among the most central and used terms in the “lean” literature, no commonly accepted definitions of the two terms exist. The following definitions are proposed: • Value is a wanted output • Waste is the use of more than needed, or an unwanted output Value is related to wanted things (coming out of production), whereas waste can be related both to activities (inside production) and to unwanted things (coming out of production) ...|$|E

When the products are disposed instead of being reused, recycled and refurbished they will create the outside pollution and GHG emissions in many ways due to transport from the source to a landfill site; disposal of synthetic materials contributes to toxic waste, which can leach from landfill, and finally, such materials take up {{a large amount of}} space in landfill sites and create the need for new waste disposal sites (ERDC 2001).

40|$|Abstract:- In {{the leather}} sector {{different}} types of finished leather products are prepared from raw salted skins. About 130 {{different types of}} chemicals are used in leather manufacturing ranging from common salt (sodium chloride) to the very expensive chrome sulphate. The chrome tanning process is widely employed in many countries including tanneries in Zimbabwe. Many chemicals are used to prepare hides for tanning, and after use these chemicals {{find their way into}} the environment. All three <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste,</b> i. e. gaseous, liquid and solid are generated from the tanneries. This paper seeks to address the environmental pollution problems at a leather manufacturing company in Zimbabwe. An essential part of such a new approach is the concept of Cleaner Production (CP), an integrated preventative strategy aimed at minimising waste and improving the efficiency of processes, products and services. Raw salted skins are mainly used in Zimbabwe and these result in many salts finding their way in the tanneries effluent. This research was therefore mainly concerned with salt reduction in the effluents by incorporating a chilling unit to the tannery though they are many Cleaner Production options in the leather manufacturing industry...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyze context and {{strategies}} to decrease the alternative use of safe food product that does not fit into the market system. This process is revealed in a case study of a horsemeat food fraud in the Czech Republic that took place in 2013. Unlike many other European countries, in the Czech Republic food products containing undeclared horsemeat were not given to charities or used as a source of fuel but were classified as dangerous and thus turned to a category of non-edible food. How can we understand this way of processing and what can this case say about attitudes towards classification of food? Following a story of products containing undeclared horsemeat, a network of context and strategies that are relevant in this case is developed. The analysis is inspired by Science and Technology Studies, mainly the study of classification and standards. The horsemeat case shows that <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> and food are consequences of depoliticization of politics, market regulation, technologies, and understanding of objects.

The quantity with which electronic {{and electrical}} products are produced, consumed and discarded is growing rapidly.

Consequently, the combined result of shortened product lifespans with growing demand and consumption of electronic and electrical products, in both developed and developing countries is the escalating growth in end-of-life electrical and electronic products.
