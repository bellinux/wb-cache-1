40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{relationships}} among various stepping parameters, sex, and age in the elderly. Healthy elderly Japanese individuals 60 - 85 years old (50 males and 61 females) performed 4 types of stepping motions for 20 s. Stepping motions included bilateral stepping (back/forth and right/left) and unilateral stepping (back/forth and right/left). The number of steps, the average <b>connecting</b> <b>time</b> of a foot during one step, and the average time of both feet touching the floor at the same <b>time</b> (bilateral <b>connecting</b> <b>time)</b> were measured with a foot switch sheet. The trial-to-trial reliability was very high (above 0. 86) except for the bilateral <b>connecting</b> <b>time</b> in the bilateral stepping back/forth test for 70 - 85 year olds (males: 0. 67, females: 0. 68). With age, the number of steps was significantly smaller, and the average <b>connecting</b> <b>time</b> and the bilateral <b>connecting</b> <b>time</b> were shorter in all stepping tests. There were significant sex differences in bilateral <b>connecting</b> <b>time</b> for bilateral stepping right and left {{and the number of}} steps for the bilateral stepping back and forth and the unilateral stepping right and left tests. The number of steps and average <b>connecting</b> <b>time</b> showed high correlations between bilateral stepping right/left and back/forth (r= 0. 71 - 0. 94) and between unilateral stepping back/forth and right/left (r= 0. 87 - 0. 99). There were significant correlations of the average <b>connecting</b> <b>time</b> between bilateral and unilateral stepping motions (r= 0. 51 - 0. 83), but both stepping motions are considered to have different motion properties from the viewpoint of center of gravity sway. The correlations between the bilateral <b>connecting</b> <b>time</b> and the number of steps in bilateral stepping were relatively low (males: |r|< 0. 70, females: |r|< 0. 57). The bilateral <b>connecting</b> <b>time</b> was near 0 s in many males; thus, it may depend greatly on individual or sex differences in stepping strategy. These results suggest that the stepping motions used in this study can evaluate dynamic balance ability, and that the unilateral test may be useful for the elderly who cannot walk independently with ease...|$|R
40|$|Network {{airlines}} traditionally try {{to minimize}} the elapsed time of their passengers in connecting travel, {{based on the assumption}} that longer elapsed times would make their itinerary less competitive and thus reduce their revenue potential in a given origin destination market. Contrary to the traditional assumption, we hypothesize that passengers assign a lower utility to connections close to the minimum <b>connecting</b> <b>time</b> published by airports. We hypothesize that there are three factors related to connection time that a customer might consider when choosing an itinerary: The risk of misconnection, the discomfort associated with rushing through an airport terminal, and the trust in an airline to provide reliable connections. Attitudes toward these constructs are latent and cannot be directly observed. In aggregate, we expect an n-shaped utility function for the time additional to the minimum <b>connecting</b> <b>time,</b> with increasing utility close to the minimum <b>connecting</b> <b>time,</b> followed by a time window of indifference, followed by decreasing utility due to value of time aspects. We first present a case study using airline booking data that shows that up to 25 % of passengers in a sample market voluntarily choose a longer connection, all else equal. In the subsequent chapters, a model to evaluate systematically the impact of length of <b>connecting</b> <b>time</b> is developed. We extend an existing airline survey to incorporate this question. A stated preference experiment is designed and conducted to collect choice data. Psychometric indicators are used to capture attitudes that are explained with socio-demographics and trip characteristics in a multiple indicator-multiple causes (MIMC) model. The MIMC model is then combined with the choice model to simultaneously estimate an integrated choice and latent variable model, quantifying the interactions of latent attitudes and <b>connecting</b> <b>time.</b> The results demonstrate the non-monotonicity of <b>connecting</b> <b>time</b> utility and the disutility associated with short <b>connecting</b> <b>times.</b> The inclusion of the latent variables risk, rush and trust demonstrates the effect of these constructs on choice. Individuals who are risk averse, rush averse or have a low level of trust into airlines' scheduling reliability have a higher utility for slightly longer <b>connecting</b> <b>times.</b> This is the first research in the airline choice literature to demonstrate the nonlinearity of <b>connecting</b> <b>time</b> utility. It is also the first research to include attitudes into itinerary choice models, thereby providing a richer explanation for passenger airline choice. Airlines can use the findings to better align their service offerings with their customers' preferences and at the same time reduce their operational costs. by Georg Wilhelm Theis. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a network model to analyse the economic effects {{resulting from the}} non-price competition between the home country's and neighbouring country's hub-airports. Focusing on the trade-off relationship between {{the length of the}} <b>connecting</b> <b>time</b> in the hub-airport and the consumption opportunities of the transfer passengers, we demonstrate theoretically that even though the hub-airport bears a cost disadvantage over its rival in providing the hub-airport service, it still has a chance to earn more profits than its rival by the setting of the <b>connecting</b> <b>time.</b> This finding suggests a new methodology for hub-airports that attempt to alleviate price competition.
