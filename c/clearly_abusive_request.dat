5000|$|In {{the most}} famous example, members of the Chinese, Indonesian and South Korean {{badminton}} teams were disqualified for intentionally losing matches to allow better pairings in the knockout stages of the competition. In what the BBC called a “night of shame,” players made simple errors throughout the match, despite boos from the crowd and warnings from the match referee to cease and desist.

30|$|In this sense, in {{the day-to-day}} life of the university, the student deals with {{situations}} {{that are difficult to}} manage, such as requesting changes in the behavior of colleagues, rejecting <b>abusive</b> <b>requests,</b> giving and receiving criticism from peers and teachers, and expressing and defending opinions in public. These challenges, configured by the university context, can be very stressful, to the point of generating consequences that are harmful {{to the health of the}} student. High stress levels in university students are characterized by “emotional exhaustion” due to academic demands; “disbelief,” as an attitude distanced from the studies and “professional inefficiency,” identified through self-perceived incompetence (Borges & Carlotto, 2004).|$|R

30|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that men in this study showed higher skills in dealing with fair and unfair criticism, {{as well as in}} dealing with parent’s criticism and with offensive mockery or games. On the other hand, women had greater difficulties in expressing their needs to others and higher social anxiety regarding criticism and rejection, corroborating with data found in the literature (Caballo et al., 2014; Muller et al., 2009). According to a systematic review, which sought to identify studies on impulsivity in alcoholics, women tend to have higher inhibition in seeking satisfaction for the need of other to maintain a pro-social environment (Pasa & Almeida, 2010). A study with adolescents demonstrated that low social competence is an influencing factor for the onset of smoking among girls but not among boys, emphasizing that girls tend to accept more easily the pressure of peers for fear of not fitting in with the group (Westling et al. 2012). In this perspective, Ribeiro and Laranjeira (2012) highlight that the very feeling of love and companionship, combined with the fear of not being accepted, influences the difficulty of denying crack when someone close offers it. Such aspects reinforce the relevance of intervening in learning and/or improvement of defense of rights, rejecting <b>abusive</b> <b>requests</b> and dealing with unfair criticism skills in the female population, since such losses may pose the greatest risk factors for addictive behaviors among women.|$|R
5000|$|Murphy quickly began “changing his {{department}} irrevocably … (he) {{put in place}} systems to hold supervisors and administrators strictly accountable for the integrity and civility of their personnel… He rewarded cops who turned in corrupt or brutal colleagues and punished those who, although personally honest, {{looked the other way}} when they learned of misconduct,” according to criminal justice scholars Jerome H. Skolnick and James J. Fyfe. They write that “Murphy used his {{three and a half years}} in office to create an environment that loudly and <b>clearly</b> condemned <b>abusive</b> police conduct, those who engage in it and - equally important - those who tolerate it.” [...] In August 1972, Murphy introduced a new policy restricting “the use of deadly force to situations involving the defense of life, replacing the traditional ‘fleeing felon’ rule. The policy also prohibited discharging firearms as warning shots, as calls for assistance, or at or from moving vehicles,” writes Samuel Walker, a criminal justice professor at the University of Nebraska. Murphy’s defense-of-life policy “was a radical innovation. To be fair, there were undoubtedly other law enforcement agencies that already had restrictive policies... The important point, however, is that none had the lasting national impact on policy that New York City’s had. Within a matter of a few years, the defense-of-life policy was the standard policy in major cities across the country.” ...|$|R

A policy owner with unneeded life insurance can surrender the policy to the insurer for its cash surrender value. Or, the owner may receive more by selling the policy to a third-party investor through a life settlement. These transactions have involved high-dollar-amount policies covering older persons. Despite their potential benefits, life settlements can have unintended consequences for policy owners, such as unexpected tax liabilities. Also, policy owners commonly rely on intermediaries to help them, and some intermediaries may engage in <b>abusive</b> practices. As <b>requested,</b> this report addresses how the life settlement market is organized and regulated, and what challenges policy owners, investors, and others face in connection with life settlements. GAO reviewed and analyzed studies on life settlements and applicable state and federal laws; surveyed insurance regulators and life settlement providers; and interviewed relevant market participants, state and federal regulators, trade associations, and market observers. ...|$|R
