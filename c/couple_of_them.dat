The Express shootaround was set to take place before that of the Rainmen. The road team was supposed to arrive for warm-ups at approximately 1:00 PM, but entered the stadium approximately two hours earlier. Express assistant coach Gerry Brumpton recounted, [...] "They snuck in here before they even had the light on. We were here in the dark, I opened up the curtain and I looked in and there they were. They were still here working out. So they had been here for a while." [...] The Express told their opponents to leave the arena, but they refused, with one Rainmen player dunking a basketball instead. Windsor's Bill Jones then attempted to take a ball from Halifax center Liam McMorrow, but the player [...] "flinched," [...] pretending to throw a punch. According to Rainmen player Forrest Fisher, Jones tackled McMorrow to the ground and Express guard Tony Bennett followed up by hitting McMorrow with a chair. Referring to the Rainmen, Jones said, [...] "A <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> kicked me and tried to take swings at me. And my players were there and they came to my rescue {{to be able to get}} me up." [...] Soon the violence escalated, with staff members and players from both teams involved. At around 10:40 AM, Windsor police received a phone call [...] "that between 15 to 20 men were involved in an altercation." [...] By the time they arrived at the WFCU Centre, however, the fighting was over and the Rainmen players had already reached their team bus.|$|E

However, he has been under fire often for imprisonment of journalists and lately for some website censorship. The Meles government defends its action on the ground that the banned media outlets advocated [...] "a certain population should be quarantined" [...] and incited [...] "violence among different ethnic groups in the country," [...] including using hate-filled text messages on mobile phones asking people to attack ethnic groups. Some sources blame certain websites and papers who have been caught inciting violence and asking for bombings on companies. A <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> have even been sued for provoking uprising. Others claim that the supporters of the previous dictatorship government are trying to use the new opportunity to freely express themselves by defaming the current government officials. But the government critics say that the ruling party is not willing to be criticised. Many reports of international organizations support their claim. Strong criticism came from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). In its 2007 press freedom summary it wrote, [...] "Ethiopia [...] the world's worst backslider on press freedom over the previous five years". At the start of 2010, the Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that an Ethiopian journalist has been jailed for a year for criticising Meles.|$|E

Under this doctrine, men no longer are allowed to have children with their wives.

2500|$|Anderson {{returned}} to cinema screens in 2002 with Resident Evil, {{a science fiction}} action horror film, loosely based on the video game series {{of the same name}} by Capcom. Anderson {{came up with the idea}} of adapting the games, after playing the first <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> for days in his apartment. Because Constantin Film, who had acquired the rights to the series, weren't willing to spend more money than they already had on failed attempts (including a script by George A. Romero), Anderson convinced them to write the script, titled The Undead, on spec. If they liked it, he would sell it to them as a Resident Evil film; if not, he would take it elsewhere and try to make it unrelated to the games. Anderson saw the film as a prequel of sorts to the first game in the series, and as such didn't put any characters from the games in it, a fact which was criticized by fans. Instead, the film stars Milla Jovovich as an original character named Alice. Jovovich, who is the only actor that reprised her role in all six films of the series, began dating with Anderson after the two met on this film, and they eventually had children and got married together. In comparison to Anderson's previous two films, Resident Evil was produced on a moderate budget of $33 million and became a commercial success of little over $100 million at the box office. The film also performed strongly on home video. Critically Resident Evil wasn't received well, although, similarly to Mortal Kombat, some reviews characterized it as one of the better attempts at adapting a video game. It received the fair rating of B by audiences on a Cinemascore poll. Its relative popularity made Capcom put homages to it in video games Resident Evil 4 and [...] Anderson did not direct, but he wrote, produced, and was otherwise heavily involved with the making of two sequels, [...] (2004) and [...] (2007), which completed the first of the eventual two trilogies of Resident Evil films. In these two sequels, Anderson began to introduce characters from the games, albeit in supporting roles compared to Alice. Both films received similarly negative reviews to the first, but were even bigger commercial successes.|$|E
