Much of the plants' current popularity can probably be attributed to Shigeo Kurata, whose book Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu (1976), which featured the best <b>colour</b> <b>photography</b> of Nepenthes to date, did much to bring attention to these unusual plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{photosensitivity}} of {{the silver}} halides allowed for their use in traditional photography, although digital photography, which does not use silver, is now dominant. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. <b>Colour</b> <b>photography</b> requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{was also}} {{interested}} in applying his theory of colour perception, namely in <b>colour</b> <b>photography.</b> Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced {{with a set of}} three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through red, green and blue filters and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.|$|E

25|$|Scientific {{advances}} have made possible much more accurate {{investigation of the}} materials and techniques used to create works, especially infra-red and x-ray photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of pigments used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. Dendrochronology for panel paintings and radio-carbon dating for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good <b>colour</b> <b>photography,</b> now held digitally and {{available on the internet}} or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as illuminated manuscripts and Persian miniatures, and many types of archaeological artworks.|$|E
500|$|During an 1861 Royal Institution {{lecture on}} colour theory, Maxwell {{presented}} the world's first demonstration of <b>colour</b> <b>photography</b> by this principle of three-colour analysis and synthesis. Thomas Sutton, {{inventor of the}} single-lens reflex camera, took the picture. He photographed a tartan ribbon three times, through red, green, and blue filters, also making a fourth photograph through a yellow filter, which, according to Maxwell's account, was not used in the demonstration. Because Sutton's photographic plates were [...] insensitive to red and barely sensitive to green, {{the results of this}} pioneering experiment were far from perfect. It was remarked in the published account of the lecture that [...] "if the red and green images had been as fully photographed as the blue," [...] it [...] "would have been a truly-coloured image of the riband. By finding photographic materials more sensitive to the less refrangible rays, the representation of the colours of objects might be greatly improved." [...] Researchers in 1961 concluded that the seemingly impossible partial success of the red-filtered exposure was due to ultraviolet light, which is strongly reflected by some red dyes, not entirely blocked by the red filter used, and within the range of sensitivity of the wet collodion process Sutton employed.|$|E

His diffraction gratings were particularly noted in an obituary, which said that they made [...] Prior to his developments, details of which he published but did not patent, interested people had to rely upon the photographic methods that had been proposed by Lord Rayleigh and Izarn. Thorp's [...] "brilliant idea", announced in 1898 and improved thereafter through experimentation {{and the development of}} new materials, was to take [...] "a cast of the ruled surface in a transparent medium [...] a thin solution of celluloid in amyl acetate." [...] He described his method on numerous occasions, including in a letter published in the edition of 29 December 1905 of the British Journal of Photography (reproduced in Popular Astronomy, 1906), He emphasised the need for a dust-free environment and a uniform drying of the solution as well as asserting that his was the [...] "first method of producing optically useful replicas of gratings and one which after all has not in my opinion been superseded." [...] By 1900 he was able to apply his developments to <b>colour</b> <b>photography</b> and he went on to demonstrate to the British Astronomical Association a method for projecting natural colours that used [...] "three replicas adjusted to diffract the proper colour sensations to the eye".|$|E
60|$|The {{medical staff}} {{consisted}} of a Dr. Poujoulet and two assistants. The authorities were always promising to send him more help, but it never arrived. One of the assistants, a Monsieur Dubos, a little man with a remarkably big beard, was a chemist, who, at {{the outbreak of the}} war, had been on the verge, as he made sure, of an important discovery in connection with <b>colour</b> <b>photography.</b> Almost the first question he asked Joan was could she speak German. Finding that she could, he had hurried her across the yard into a small hut where patients who had borne their operation successfully awaited their turn to be moved down to one of the convalescent hospitals at the base. Among them was a German prisoner, an elderly man, belonging to the Landwehr; in private life a photographer. He also had been making experiments in the direction of <b>colour</b> <b>photography.</b> Chance had revealed to the two men their common interest, and they had been exchanging notes. The German talked a little French, but not sufficient; and on the day of Joan's arrival they had reached an impasse that was maddening to both of them. Joan found herself up against technical terms that rendered her task difficult, but fortunately had brought a dictionary with her, and was able to make them understand one another. But she had to be firm with both of them, allowing them only ten minutes together at a time. The little Frenchman would kneel by the bedside, holding the German at an angle where he could talk with least danger to his wound. It seemed that each was the very man the other had been waiting all his life to meet. They shed tears on one another's neck when they parted, making all arrangements to write to one another.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} {{the potential for}} using archival <b>colour</b> vertical aerial <b>photography</b> to map the spatial location, distribution, extent and changes over time in weedmat coverage for the Ythan estuary, North East Scotland, UK. Archival <b>colour</b> aerial <b>photography</b> scanned into a computer, and processed using image processing techniques resulted {{in a series of}} mosaiced images for visual interpretation of the location and extent of weedmats for each year of photography selected. Input of the imagery into a Geographical Information System (GIS) enabled the derivation of maps showing change and quantitative estimates of the areal coverage of macro-algal weedmats for each year. It is concluded that macro-algal weedmats can easily be differentiated on <b>colour</b> aerial <b>photography</b> from background mud and sand deposits, but {{it is not possible to}} reliably separate individual macro-algal species from each other, or to distinguish weedmat densities without the availability of additional co-incident field data...|$|R

40|$|Presentaton Purpose:We {{conducted}} a small study {{to assess the}} novel, retro - mode imaging technique of the NIDEK F- 10 scanning laser ophthalmoscope, for detecting and quantifying retinal drusen. Methods:Fundus photographs of 4 eyes of 2 patients taken in retro-mode on the Nidek F- 10 SLO were graded independently by 6,experienced, masked fundus graders {{for the presence of}} retinal drusen, and compared to stereo colour fundus photographs taken with a Topcon TRC- 50 DX camera. Results:The mean number of retinal drusen detected in retro mode was 142. 96 +/- 60. 8, range 63 - 265, and on <b>colour</b> fundus <b>photography</b> mean of 66. 6 +/- 32. 6, range 26 - 177. All observers independently detected approximately twice as many drusen on retro-mode than <b>colour</b> fundus <b>photography</b> (p< 0. 0001, Student’s paired t-test). The statistical significance of interobserver variation in drusen detection was p= 0. 07 on <b>colour</b> fundus <b>photography,</b> and p= 0. 02 on retro mode (ANOVA). Conclusions:The retro-mode of the F- 10 camera uses infrared laser and an aperture with a modified central stop, with the aperture deviated laterally from the confocal light path. This forms a pseudo - 3 D image which is a new means of detecting abnomalites in the deeper retinal layers. Retro-mode imaging of retinal drusen using the F- 10 Nidek SLO is a highly sensitive technique for detecting and quantifying retinal drusen, and detected twice as many drusen than <b>colour</b> fundus <b>photography.</b> This small pilot study suggests that this novel type of imaging may have a role in the future detection and analysis of retinal drusen, a field that is likely to become increasingly important in future AMD prevention studies...|$|R
