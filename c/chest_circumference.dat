40|$|The authors {{evaluated}} {{the association of}} prenatal arsenic exposure with size at birth (birth weight, birth length, head and <b>chest</b> <b>circumferences).</b> This prospective cohort study, based on 1, 578 mother-infant pairs, was conducted in Matlab, Bangladesh, in 2002 – 2003. Arsenic exposure was assessed by analysis of arsenic in urine collected at around gestational weeks 8 and 30. The association of arsenic exposure with size at birth was assessed by linear regression analyses. In analysis over {{the full range of}} exposure (6 – 978 lg/L), no dose-effect association was found with birth size. However, significant negative dose effects were found with birth weight and head and <b>chest</b> <b>circumferences</b> at a low level of arsenic exposure (< 100 lg/L in urine). In this range of exposure, birth weight decreased by 1. 68 (standard error (SE), 0. 62) g for each 1 -lg/L increase of arsenic in urine. For head and <b>chest</b> <b>circumferences,</b> the corresponding reductions were 0. 05 (SE, 0. 03) mm and 0. 14 (SE, 0. 03) mm per 1 lg/L, respectively. No further negative effects were shown at higher levels of arsenic exposure.

40|$|Objective: To assess {{in women}} whether {{exercise}} affects the estimated age-related increase in adiposity, and contrariwise, whether age affects the estimated exercise-related decrease in adiposity. Subjects and Design: Cross-sectional analyses of 64, 911 female runners who provided data on their {{body mass index}} (97. 6 percent), waist (91. 1 percent), and <b>chest</b> <b>circumferences</b> (77. 9 percent). Results: Age affected the relationships between vigorous exercise and adiposity. The decline in BMI per km/wk run was linear in 18 - 25 year olds (- 0. 023 +- 0. 002 kg/m 2 per km run) and became increasingly nonlinear (convex or upwardly concave) with age. The waist, hip and <b>chest</b> <b>circumferences</b> declined significantly with running distance across all age groups, but the declines were 52 - 58 percent greater in older than younger women (P< 10 - 5). The relationships between body circumferences and running distance became increasingly convexity (upward concavity) in older women. Conversely, vigorous exercise diminished the apparent increase in adiposity with age. The rise in average BMI with age was greatest in women who ran less than 8 km/week (0. 065 +- 0. 005 kg/m 2 per y), intermediate of women who ran 8 - 16 km/wk (0. 025 +- 0. 004 kg/m 2 per y) or 16 - 32 km/wk (0. 022 +- 0. 003 kg/m 2 per y), and least in those who averaged over 32 km/wk (0. 017 +- 0. 001 kg/m 2 per y). Before age 45, waist circumference rose 0. 055 +- 0. 026 cm in for those who ran 0 - 8 km/wk, showed no significant change for those who ran 8 - 40 km. /wk, and declined - 0. 057 +- 0. 012 and - 0. 069 +- 0. 014 cm per year in those who ran 40 - 56 and over 56 km/wk. The rise in hip and <b>chest</b> <b>circumferences</b> with age were significantly greater in women who ran under eight km/wk than longer distance runners for hip (0. 231 +- 0. 018 vs 0. 136 +- 0. 004 cm/year) and <b>chest</b> <b>circumferences</b> (0. 137 +- 0. 013 vs 0. 053 +- 0. 003 cm/year). Conclusions: These cross-sectional associations suggest that in women, age and vigorous exercise {{interact with each other}} in affecting adiposity.

Mean height, weight, fundal height and haemoglobin of pregnant women were 155. 6 cm, 59. 5 kg, 34. 0 cm and 10. 6 g/dl respectively. Computation of nutrient intakes (based on 24 h recall method) showed that the mean intake of energy was 1785. 0 kcal, protein 56. 2, calcium 775. 6 mg, iron 17. 9 mg, zinc 8. 5 mg and magnesium 482. 3 mg. Percent adequacy of nutrient intake with reference to recommended allowances showed that only magnesium was adequate but other nutrients mentioned above were inadequate. The mean birth weight of neonates was 2. 9 kg. Height, head and <b>chest</b> <b>circumferences</b> were 48. 5, 33. 6 and 32. 3 cm respectively. Twenty five percent of neonates considered as low birth weight.

Maternal height, weight, fundal height and haemoglobin level were significantly correlated with birth weight. Nutrient intakes, namely energy, protein, calcium, magnesium, iron and zinc in the third trimester were significantly correlated with birth weight.

40|$|QuestionWhat is the {{relationship}} between vibration of the chest wall and the resulting chest wall force, <b>chest</b> wall <b>circumference,</b> intrapleural pressure, and expiratory flow rate? Is the change in intrapleural pressure during vibration the sum of the intrapleural pressure due to recoil of the lung, chest wall compression, and chest wall oscillation?DesignRandomised, within-subject, experimental study. ParticipantsSeven experienced cardiopulmonary physiotherapists and three healthy adults. InterventionVibration (compression + oscillation), compression alone, and oscillation alone were applied manually to the chest walls of healthy participants during passive exertion and compared with passive expiration alone. Outcome measuresChest wall force, <b>chest</b> wall <b>circumference,</b> intrapleural pressure, and expiratory flow rate. ResultsDuring vibration, coherence was high (r 2 > 0. 97) between external chest wall force, <b>chest</b> wall <b>circumference,</b> intrapleural pressure, and expiratory flow. The mean change in intrapleural pressure during vibration was 9. 55 cmH 2 O (SD 1. 66), during chest compression alone was 8. 06 cmH 2 O (SD 1. 65), during oscillation alone was 7. 93 cmH 2 O (SD 1. 57), and during passive expiration alone was 6. 82 cmH 2 O (SD 1. 51). During vibration, compression contributed 13 % of the change in intrapleural pressure, oscillation contributed 12 %, and lung recoil contributed the remaining 75 %. ConclusionsDuring vibration the chest behaves as a highly linear system. Changes in intrapleural pressure occurring during vibration appear to be the sum of changes in pressure due to lung recoil and the compressive and oscillatory components of the technique, which suggests that all three components are required to optimise expiratory flow...|$|R
40|$|Neonatal {{mortality}} rate (NMR) is {{an increasingly important}} public health issues in many developing countries. Neonatal death now accounts for {{about two-thirds of the}} eight million infant deaths that occur globally each year. It is well-documented that low birth weight (LBW) is the most significant factor influencing NMR. This paper deploys multi-regression models to identify the significant factors for forecasting the weight of the LBW babies. The model explores the relationship between weights, baby&# 039;s characteristics, gestation age and mother pre-pregnancy BMI. The results indicate that 65. 9 % of the variations in the weight of the LBW babies can be explained by baby&# 039;s characteristics such as the height, head and <b>chest</b> <b>circumferences,</b> the gestation age and mother&# 039;s BMI.

It is a tool that provides rapid and quantitative assessment of nutritional and clinical states in children, adults or other population groups. Height, weight, waist and hip circumferences in adults, Midarm Circumference (MAC) head and <b>chest</b> <b>circumferences</b> are common anthropometric measurements in children. Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist-To-Hip Ratio (WHR) and Waist-To-Height Ratio (WHtR) commonly used indices to identify adults for intervention and follow up. Anthropometry is a simple, noninvasive and inexpensive method used in community or clinic settings for screening for underlying disease or risk factors. Bihar state has a high population of rural poor. It was decided to study anthropometric patterns of low-income villagers and their vulnerability to CVD risk factors, which are generally associated with affluence and urbanisation.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the association between 2 D: 4 D ratio and various indices of body composition in Chuvashian males and females. The study sample included 802 males (mean age 46. 98 ± 17. 10 years) and 783 females (mean age 48. 65 ± 16. 62 years). Single plain radiographs of both hands were taken. Each hand was classified according to whether the index finger was longer (Type 1), equal to (Type 2) or shorter than the ring finger (Type 3) by visual comparison of the soft tissue outline of the finger ends on the radiograph. Anthropometry, including body weight, stature, and six circumferences from the body trunk and extremities were taken from each participant. We found no evidence of substantial associations between visually assessed finger length ratio and adult BMI, WC, hip and <b>chest</b> <b>circumferences,</b> WHT and WCR for men and women.

40|$|Background: Weight gain during {{pregnancy}} {{for women with}} normal Body Mass Index (BMI) before pregnancy {{has been reported to}} be 11. 5 – 16. 0 Kg/m 2 by IOM and supported by several authors. This study was carried out to determine the relationship between pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain and pregnancy outcome. Methods: In 476 pregnant women, BMI was categorized and weight gain was divided into less than normal and higher than normal groups based on Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations. Results: Women with normal weight gain had better pregnancy outcomes. The incidence of low birth weight was higher among underweight women and those with low gestational weight gain. Overweight women and those with high gestational weight gain had a higher rate of cesarean delivery and postpartum hemorrhage.

40|$|Vibration is {{a manual}} {{technique}} used widely {{to assist with}} the removal of pulmonary secretions. Little is known about how vibration is applied or its effect on the respiratory system. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe mechanical consequences of vibration on the chest wall of a normal subject and the effects of vibration on expiratory flow rates and volumes. The effects of vibration were compared to other interventions of chest wall compression, chest wall oscillation, cough, huff from high lung volume, inspiration to total lung capacity with relaxed expiration, tidal breathing, and sham. Sixteen physiotherapists applied vibration and other interventions in a randomised order to the chest wall of a healthy adult female subject. The magnitude and direction of the force and the frequency of vibration were measured by an instrumented bed with seven load cells. Inductive plethsysmography measured the change in <b>chest</b> wall <b>circumference</b> with vibration. A heated pneumotachometer measured inspiratory and expiratory flow rates, which were integrated to provide volumes. Vibration was applied with a mean resultant force of 74. 4 N (SD 47. 1).

Mastectomy not only helps {{in improving the}} shape of anterior chest, but can also improve the location of nipple. Therefore, a principle element of mastectomy design is defining the normal location of nipple based on major anatomical reference points. Here, the nipple location was compared for before and after gynecomastia surgery. In addition, the same was also compared between male patients undergoing gynecomastia surgery and control group of subjects without gynecomastia. MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed gynecomastia patients who underwent conventional subcutaneous mastectomy. Preoperative and postoperative anatomical landmark distances and <b>chest</b> <b>circumferences</b> were measured and compared to the same anthropometric data from 20 healthy adult male controls. ResultsNipple locations were compared among 13 patients and 20 controls. The mean weight of resected breast tissue was 246 g, and overall patient satisfaction grade was 4. 3 out of 5. In the patient group, the slopes for the height-distance from the sternal notch to the nipple and chest circumference-distance between the mid-line of the sternum and the nipple were 0. 175 and 0. 125 postoperatively, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{see whether}} reduced rates of fetal growth {{are related to}} raised serum {{cholesterol}} concentrations in adult life. DESIGN [...] Follow up study {{of men and women}} whose size at birth had been recorded. SETTING [...] Jessop and Northern General Hospitals, Sheffield. SUBJECTS [...] 219 men and women born in the Jessop Hospital during 1939 - 40. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B. RESULTS [...] Men and women who had had a small abdominal circumference at birth had raised serum concentrations of total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. This was independent of the duration of gestation. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol fell by 0. 25 mmol/l (95 % confidence interval 0. 09 to 0. 42) with each 1 in (2. 54 cm) increase in abdominal circumference. The corresponding figure for serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol was 0. 26 mmol/l (0. 11 to 0. 42) and for serum apolipoprotein B 0. 04 g/l (0. 02 to 0. 07). Small head and <b>chest</b> <b>circumferences</b> at birth and short length were each associated with raised serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations but the trends disappeared in a simultaneous regression with abdominal circumference at birth. The association between abdominal circumference at birth and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was independent of social class, current body weight, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION [...] Raised serum cholesterol concentrations in adult life are associated with impaired growth during late gestation, when fetal undernutrition has a disproportionate effect on liver growth. Impaired liver growth may permanently alter low density lipoprotein cholesterol metabolism...|$|R

Results: Between 18 to 55 years old, the decline in BMI with weekly distance run (slope+-SE) was significantly greater in men 25 - 55 years old (slope+-:- 0. 036 +- 0. 001 kg/m 2 per km/wk) than in younger men (- 0. 020 +- 0. 002 kg/m 2 per km/wk). Declines in waist circumference with running distance were also significantly greater in older than younger men (P 16 km/wk). In men over 50 years old, BMI declined - 0. 038 +- 0. 001 kg/m 2 per km/wk run when adjusted for age and declined - 0. 054 +- 0. 003 kg/m 2 (increased 0. 021 +- 0. 007 cm) per year of age when adjusted for running distance. Their waist circumference declined - 0. 096 +- 0. 002 cm per km/wk run when adjusted for age and increased 0. 021 +- 0. 007 cm per year of age when adjusted for running distance. Conclusions: These cross-sectional data suggest that age and vigorous exercise {{interact with each other}} in affecting men s adiposity, and support the proposition that vigorous physical activity must increase with age to prevent middle-age weight gain. We estimate that a man who ran 16 km/wk at age 25 would need to increase their weekly running distance by 65. 7 km/wk by age 50 in order to maintain his same waist circumference...|$|R
