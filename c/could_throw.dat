5|$|The {{incendiary}} liquids of {{the ancient}} and medieval periods were also developed, and have their modern equivalents. World War I saw {{the development of the}} flamethrower, a modern version of the Byzantine siphons, which used gas under pressure to squirt a mixture of inflammable oil and petrol, ignited by a burning taper. Similarly, the carcass projectile found new use in the Livens Projector, a primitive mortar that <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> a large canister of inflammable liquid (it was soon used for poison gas instead).|$|E
5|$|During November 1908, Maeda went to Paris, France, {{apparently}} {{to see his}} friend Akitaro Ono. From Paris, he went to Havana, arriving there on December 14, 1908, and his twice-a-day wrestling act quickly proved to be very popular. On July 23, 1909, Maeda left Havana for Mexico City. His debut in Mexico City {{took place at the}} Virginia Fabregas Theater on July 14, 1909. This show was a private demonstration for some military cadets. Shortly afterwards, Maeda began appearing at the Principal Theater. His standing offer was 100 pesos (US $50) to anyone he could not throw, and 500 pesos (US $250) to anyone who <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> him. The Mexican Herald did not record anyone taking his money.|$|E
5|$|Hilliard {{averaged}} 19.7 {{points per}} game as a senior. He was named Express-Times {{player of the year}} after leading the Hurricanes to {{the second round of the}} PIAA playoffs. Hilliard scored 1,413 points in his high school career, finishing second in Liberty history to Warren West. He committed to Villanova in November 2010. When Hilliard informed his mother he was receiving a full scholarship to Villanova, she did not understand and was trying to figure how much she would have to pay for her son's education. In addition to his basketball prowess, Hilliard was the quarterback on his high school football team and <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> the ball 65 yards.|$|E
50|$|The chakram's combat {{application}} is largely dependent on its size. Regular-sized (15+ cm dia.) steel chakram <b>could</b> be <b>thrown</b> 40-60 meters, while brass chakram, {{due to their}} better airfoil design, <b>could</b> be <b>thrown</b> in excess of 100 m. If properly constructed, {{it should be a}} perfect circle. Warriors trained by throwing chakram at lengths of green bamboo. In single combat, the chakram <b>could</b> be <b>thrown</b> underarm like a modern Aerobie. In battle, it was usually thrown vertically so as to avoid accidentally hitting an ally on the left or right side. A stack of chakram <b>could</b> be quickly <b>thrown</b> one at a time like shuriken. On elephant or horseback, chakram could be more easily thrown than spears or arrows. Because of its aerodynamic circular shape it is not easily deflected by wind.|$|R

5|$|Parseghian also {{recognized}} talent in quarterback John Huarte {{and wide receiver}} Jack Snow, who had been used only sparingly for two seasons by previous coaches. Huarte <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> far and accurately but was soft-spoken, a trait Parseghian and his staff helped change. Snow was large for a receiver of his era, but Parseghian thought his athleticism and sure hands would make him a good wideout. Still, expectations were muted for the 1964 season: Parseghian told his coaches that the team would have a 6–4 record if they were lucky. Sports Illustrated predicted a 5–5 record at best, and the team did not rank among the top 20 programs {{in the country in}} the pre-season AP Poll.|$|E
5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 20 November Stavka telephoned Stalingrad Front {{commander}} Andrei Yeremenko asking if he would begin his portion of the offensive on schedule, at 08:00. He responded he would do so only if the fog lifted; although the 51st Army opened its artillery barrage on time because front headquarters could not contact the division, {{the rest of the}} forces prepared for the operation received orders to postpone the attack until 10:00. The 51st Army engaged the Romanian 6th Corps, taking many prisoners. As the 57th Army joined the attack at 10:00, the situation developed {{in such a way that}} the Stalingrad Front <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> its armored corps into battle. The German 297th Infantry Division watched as its Romanian support failed to put up resistance against the Red Army. However, confusion and lack of control caused the Soviet 4th and 13th Mechanized Corps to stumble as they began to exploit the breakthroughs achieved by the opening offensive.|$|E

5|$|When the Persians {{arrived at}} Thermopylae in mid-August, they {{initially}} waited {{for three days}} for the Allies to disperse. When Xerxes was eventually persuaded that the Allies intended to contest the pass, he sent his troops to attack. However, the Greek position was ideally suited to hoplite warfare, the Persian contingents being forced to attack the phalanx head on. The Allies thus withstood two full days of battle and everything Xerxes <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> at them. However, {{at the end of}} the second day, they were betrayed by a local resident named Ephialtes who revealed to Xerxes a mountain path that led behind the Allied lines. Xerxes then sent his elite guards, the Immortals on a night march to outflank the Allied. When he was made aware of this maneuver (while the Immortals were still en route), Leonidas dismissed the bulk of the Allied army, remaining to guard the rear with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebians and perhaps a few hundred others. On the third day of the battle, the remaining Allies sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians and slaughter as many as they could. Ultimately, however, the Allied rearguard was annihilated, and the pass of Thermopylae opened to the Persians.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{performance}} on the field, Montana was not rated highly by most scouts. At one combine, Montana rated out as six-and-a-half overall with a six in arm strength, used to judge how hard and how far a prospect <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> the ball. By comparison, Jack Thompson of Washington State rated an eight, the highest grade among eligible quarterbacks.|$|E
25|$|Livens is {{best known}} for inventing the Livens Projector, a simple mortar-like weapon that <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> large drums filled with {{inflammable}} or toxic chemicals. In World War I, the Livens Projector became the standard means of delivering gas attacks and it remained in the arsenal of the British army until {{the early years of the}} Second World War.|$|E

Hope tried to board her before her captain <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> overboard any dispatches {{she was carrying}} for Napoleon Bonaparte, then in Egypt. Hope was unsuccessful, but two seamen from Alcmenes crew jumped overboard {{and were able to}} retrieve the dispatches before they sank. One of Alcemenes boats was able to rescue the intrepid seamen. The Royal Navy took the gunboat into service as HMS Legere.|$|E
25|$|The player {{controls}} {{a spacecraft}} capable of traveling faster-than-light (FTL). It {{belongs to the}} Galactic Federation, {{which is on the}} verge of collapse after losing a war with rebel forces, chiefly human in species. The player's crew intercepts a data packet from the rebel fleet containing information that <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> the rebels into disarray and ensure a Federation victory. The goal is to reach Federation headquarters, waiting several space sectors away, while avoiding destruction from hostile ships or by the pursuing rebel fleet. The final sector ends with a battle against the Rebel Flagship, a multi-stage fight which results in victory or defeat for the Federation.|$|E
25|$|Peltasts {{were armed}} {{with a number of}} {{javelins}} and a sword, carried a light shield but wore no armour, though they sometimes had helmets; they were adept at skirmishing and were often used to guard the flanks of more heavily equipped infantry. They usually adopted an open order when facing enemy heavy infantry. They <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> their javelins at will at the enemy and, unencumbered by armour or heavy shields, easily evade any counter-charges made by heavily equipped hoplites. They were, however, quite vulnerable to shock-capable cavalry and often operated to particular advantage on broken ground where cavalry was useless and heavy infantry found it difficult to maintain formation.|$|E

25|$|The {{vehicles}} used in {{the special}} challenge to reach the Pole were two 2006 Toyota Hilux double cab 3.0l diesel pickup trucks, one Toyota Land Cruiser 120 and a trailer, {{all of which were}} heavily modified by Arctic Trucks. The choice of the Hilux was due to its exceptional durability, as demonstrated in an earlier episode of Top Gear when during a series of challenges a 1988 Hilux was proven to be able to stand up to all the tests the presenters <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> at it without any parts needing to be replaced. One Hilux was rigged with cameras for the presenters, whilst the others were used by the film crew, two driver/repair experts, and one polar expert.|$|E
25|$|One day, {{during an}} attack on the Somme, Z company {{encountered}} a party of Germans who were well dug in. Grenades did not succeed in shifting them, so Livens threw in two five gallon oil drums; the burning oil was so effective that Livens' comrade, Harry Strange, wondered whether {{it would be better to}} use containers to carry flame to the enemy rather than relying on a complex flame thrower. Reflecting on the incident, Livens and Strange considered how a really large shell filled with fuel might be thrown. Although the key idea of throwing a large container of oil was due to Strange, it was Livens who went on to develop a large, but simple, mortar that <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> a three-gallon drum of oil which would burst when it landed...|$|E
25|$|William {{considered}} his veteran army to be sufficient {{in size to}} defeat any forces (all rather inexperienced) that James <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> against him, {{but it had been}} decided to avoid the hazards of battle and maintain a defensive attitude in the hope James's position might collapse by itself. Thus he landed far away from James's army, expecting that his English allies would take the initiative in acting against James while he ensured his own protection against potential attacks. William was prepared to wait; he had paid his troops in advance for a three-month campaign. A slow advance, apart from being necessitated by heavy rainfall anyway, had the added benefit of not over-extending the supply lines; the Dutch troops were under strict orders not even to forage, for fear that this would degenerate into plundering, which would alienate the population.|$|E

25|$|The fifth match pitted Kurt Angle against Chris Benoit. The match {{started with}} mat wrestling {{between the two}} but Angle soon punched Benoit out of {{frustration}} and threw {{him out of the}} ring, so he <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> him into the broadcast table and the steel steps. Back in the ring, both men tried to submit their opponent using the other's signature hold with Benoit using the ankle lock on Angle, and Angle using the Crippler Crossface on Benoit. Benoit eventually succeeded in forcing Angle to tap out to the Crippler Crossface but the referee was knocked down and didn't see it. Near the end of the match, Benoit tried to pin Angle after a diving headbutt but was met with a two-count. Angle then quickly rolled-up up Benoit, using the tights for leverage to win the match.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the event}} went live on pay-per-view, Raw's Ric Flair and Carlito faced SmackDown!'s Gregory Helms and Chavo Guerrero in a tag team {{lumberjack}} match. Flair and Carlito controlled {{the early part}} of the match until Helms threw Flair over the top rope. SmackDown! lumberjacks attacked Flair before throwing him back into the ring. Helms and Guerrero continued to beat on Flair, but couldn't pin Flair. Chavo tried to end it with his frog splash, but Flair moved. Chavo tagged in Helms, but Flair tagged in Carlito. Carlito dominated Helms, leading to Guerrero coming in to help Helms, but Flair came in and fought Guerrero. Flair and Guerrero took each other out of the ring, and before the lumberjacks <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> them back in the ring, Carlito hit the Backstabber on Guerrero to pick up the win for himself and Flair.|$|E
25|$|Other {{materials}} used, were Tonkin bamboo Calcutta reed, ash wood, hickory, ironwood, maple, lancewood, or malacca cane. These {{products were}} light, tough, and pliable. Rods were generally made in three pieces called a butt, midsection, and tip. The butts were frequently made of maple, with bored bottom; this butt outlasted several tops. Midsections were generally made from ironwood {{because it was}} a thicker, strong wood. Tips were generally made from bamboo for its elasticity which <b>could</b> <b>throw</b> the bait further and more accurately. Handles and grips were generally of cork, wood, or wrapped cane. Many different types of glue held these sections together, most commonly Irish glue and bone glue. This was until hilton glue, or cement glue, was introduced because of its waterproof qualities. Even today, Tonkin split-bamboo rods are still popular in fly fishing.|$|E
