The result finds no evidence of perceived importance of agency cost theory of listed companies in Sri Lanka. As a result, the findings those CFOs of listed companies in Sri Lanka consider different factors on debt and equity issuance decisions. The research finds no significant association between management and firm characteristics and agency cost theory in <b>corporate</b> <b>financing</b> decisions. The conclusions drawn from this study were that the <b>corporate</b> <b>financing</b> decisions in relation to agency cost theory differ from developed countries to developing country in many ways such as Sri Lanka. However, for <b>corporate</b> <b>financing</b> decisions in relation to agency cost theory to have full impact on firm value like U. S. A and Europe countries, CFOs of listed companies in Sri Lanka should consider agency cost theory that are in line with <b>corporate</b> <b>financing</b> decisions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{managerial}} overconfidence on <b>corporate</b> <b>financing</b> decision for publicly listed companies in Malaysia {{for the period of}} 2002 - 2011. Pooled OLS, fixed effect method (FEM) panel models and Tobit regressions are employed to examining the relationship between managerial overconfidence, government ownership, and leverage decision of publicly listed companies in Malaysia. This is the first study that empirically examines {{the impact of}} managerial overconfidence by testing CEO personal characteristics as a main independent variable on <b>corporate</b> <b>financing</b> decision for Malaysian firms. We also make the first attempt to test the moderating effect of government ownership on the relationship of managerial overconfidence and leverage decision. We conclude that (1) CEO overconfidence is significantly and negatively related to <b>corporate</b> <b>financing</b> decision and it is consistent with prior studies. (2) A higher degree of managerial overconfidence would result in lower leverage in GLCs, whereas the effect does not significantly exist in NGLCs. (3) A larger ownership of government in a firm will reduce the negative effect of managerial overconfidence on <b>corporate</b> <b>financing</b> decision. The finding implies that moderating effect of government ownership on the association between managerial overconfidence and <b>corporate</b> <b>financing</b> decision in GLCs is more effective than NGLCs...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we employ firm-level data {{to analyze}} {{to what extent}} {{financing}} conditions of non-financial corporations in the Euro Area depend on country-specific factors, in particular the respective country's government bond yield and the share of non-performing loans to the corporate sector. Moreover, we assess whether this relationship has changed during the European debt crisis. It {{turns out that the}} increase in <b>corporate</b> <b>financing</b> costs during the year 2011 can partially be explained by increasing government bond yields. However, the further increase of <b>corporate</b> <b>financing</b> costs in stressed Euro area countries during the year 2012 can not be explained by these yields, but by the share of non-performing loans. This finding suggests that the ECB's policy of reducing <b>corporate</b> <b>financing</b> costs in stressed countries via government bond purchases may not be effective...|$|R
