5|$|There is no {{laboratory}} test for serotonin syndrome. Therefore, diagnosis is by symptom observation and {{investigation of the}} patient's history. Several diagnostic criteria have been proposed. The first rigorously evaluated <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> introduced in 1991 by Harvey Sternbach, a {{professor of psychiatry at}} UCLA. Researchers in Australia later developed the Hunter Toxicity Criteria Decision Rules, which have better sensitivity and specificity, 84% and 97%, respectively, when compared with the gold standard of diagnosis by a medical toxicologist. As of 2007, Sternbach's <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> still the most commonly used.|$|E

It took five years to write and was completed and released in 1824. It was used as a textbook until 1855.|$|E

The Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA, had received 60 requests for public assistance throughout the area. Monetary value for the assistance was estimated at $3million and growing. Twenty-five departments and agencies were approved of for federal support, namely the U.S. V.I. Department of Public Works. Several non-profit organizations also received support from FEMA, while those that did not meet the <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> referred to the Small Business Administration’s low-interest loan program.|$|E
5|$|At the 12th Daytime Emmy Awards held in 1985, Brian Bloom was {{the first}} winner of this award for his {{portrayal}} of Dusty Donovan on As the World Turns. The awards ceremony had not been aired on television for the prior two years, having been criticized for voting integrity. The award category was originally called Outstanding Young Man or Outstanding Juvenile Male in a Drama Series, and began using its current title in 1991. Years before this category was introduced, networks declined to broadcast the show {{during a time of}} voting integrity rumors and waning interest. Confusion rose around the criteria of the new category due to the varying ages of the nominees. Within the first set of nominees, Bloom became the youngest actor nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award at the time at age 15, while the other actors nominated in the category were over 25. The <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> later altered, requiring that the actor be aged 25 or below.|$|E

5|$|At the 12th Daytime Emmy Awards held in 1985, Tracey E. Bregman was {{the first}} winner of this award for her role of Lauren Fenmore on The Young and the Restless. The awards {{ceremony}} had not been aired on television for the prior two years, having been criticized for voting integrity. The award was originally called Outstanding Ingenue in a Drama Series, the criteria of the new category were deemed confusing; performers of differing ages were nominated and critics argued some were of supporting or lead actress standards. Adding to the confusion, the first winner, Bregman, and the Outstanding Supporting Actress winner that year, Beth Maitland, played characters near to the same age. The category was renamed Outstanding Juvenile Female in a Drama Series in 1989 and began using its current title in 1991. The <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> later altered, requiring that the actress be aged 25 or below.|$|E

However, in 1988 and 1989, the award <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> changed and the video awards were presented under the categories Best Concept Music Video and Best Performance Music Video.

Award recipients include the performers, directors, and producers associated with the winning videos.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} planners specified a set {{of conditions}} regarding {{the timing of the}} invasion, deeming only a few days in each month suitable. A full moon was desirable, as it would provide illumination for aircraft pilots and have the highest tides. The Allies wanted to schedule the landings for shortly before dawn, midway between low and high tide, with the tide coming in. This would improve the visibility of obstacles the enemy had placed on the beach while minimising the amount of time the men had to spend exposed in the open. Specific <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> also set for wind speed, visibility, and cloud cover. Eisenhower had tentatively selected 5 June as the date for the assault. However, on 4 June, conditions were clearly unsuitable for a landing; high winds and heavy seas made it impossible to launch landing craft, and low clouds would prevent aircraft from finding their targets.|$|E

Surprisingly, the answer was that all <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> of roughly equal importance. No particular indicator or cluster of indicators predominated: it was the number and frequency of problems that best defined alcoholism. More importantly, the medical, sociological, and behavioural <b>criteria</b> <b>were</b> equally reliable (i.e. highly correlated). In other words, it was equally valid to call alcoholism a medical or a behavioural disorder—evidence that doctors and sociologists are indeed talking about the same “unitary disorder”.|$|E
