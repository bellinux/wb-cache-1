40|$|The U. S. Supreme Court has {{employed}} the per se standard for illegality of tying arrangements under antitrust laws for some sixty years. The tying arrangement, once reviled by the House of Representatives as 2 ̆ 2 {{one of the}} greatest agencies and instrumentalities of monopoly ever devised by man, 2 ̆ 2 is now understood by many to have potentially redeeming, as well as condemning, qualities. As a result, scholars and judges alike have decried the per se standard as ineffective and called for its abandonment. However, the Supreme Court continues to endorse the per se standard when assessing tying arrangements. The Seventh Circuit, like other circuits, has struggled in applying the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s per se tying analysis; this is evident in its recent decision, Reifert v. South Central MLS Corp. While all three judges hearing the <b>case</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> the outcome, Judge Wood contended that the majority misstated the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s per se analysis by adding a factor (the economic interest requirement) never recognized by the Court as a requisite for per se illegality of tying arrangements. This Comment examines and critiques the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s per se tying standard, and assesses whether the per se test provides room for the additional factor approved by the Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s Reifert majority...|$|E
40|$|The formal {{justifications}} for all detentions under s. 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983 within an inner-city mental health trust were examined over a 12 -month period. The study explored: {{the nature of}} the {{justifications for}} detention; {{the extent to which these}} were associated with patient characteristics; and the extent to which the two medical practitioners involved in each <b>case</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> the justifications. The justifications reflected a greater emphasis on the protection of the individual concerned rather than the protection of others. A content analysis of the textual justifications revealed five broad themes: {{the nature of the}} risk posed by the patient; the patient's capacity to provide informed consent; their need for hospitalization; their lack of consent to informal admission; and their reliability or likely compliance. There was a significant association between patients' sex, ethnic group, diagnosis and the nature of risk indicated in the documentation, but further research is needed to clarify the nature of this association. The study found that in nearly a quarter of cases, the two professionals did not agree about whether or not the patient presented a danger to others. This lack of agreement was not associated with any patient or professional characteristics, and may reflect the complexity of this area of risk assessment. The authors suggest that the issue of 'risk' needs to be addressed in a more sophisticated manner within the Mental Health Act. Specifically, further guidance is needed as to the nature and leuels of risk that constitute grounds for detention. Further guidance is also needed regarding the issues that need to be recorded on the legal documentation for detention...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of genital abnormalities among neonates in two public maternity-schools. Methods: Case-control, cross-sectional descriptive study. Genital morphology of 2, 916 neonates was assessed using a clinical protocol between 04 / 19 / 2010 and 04 / 18 / 2011. Control group included neonates without birth defects, born at the same maternity unit {{and in the same}} day in which a case was identified. Fisher and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for statistics. Results: The study identified 29 (1 : 100) neonates with genital abnormalities. Most of them were examined within 3 days of life and presented only one genital defect. Morphological abnormalities comprised: genital ambiguity (1 / 29), fusion of labia majora (1 / 29), micropenis (2 / 29), enlarged clitoris (6 / 29), hypospadia (9 / 29), and combined defects (4 / 29). Only one case reported the genital abnormality in the statement of live birth correctly. Prematurity occurred in 13 / 29 cases and was the only variable statistically associated with genital defects. Eight <b>cases</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> the complementary investigation of the genital defect, among which three were diagnosed with disorder of sex development. Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of genital abnormalities in the maternity units included in the present study and most cases are under-diagnosed and under-reported. Our results reinforce the importance of a careful examination of genital morphology in neonatal period towards the recognition of minor defects that can be clinical features of a disorder of sex development.

40|$|The {{large body}} of {{existing}} research in Test Case Prioritization (TCP) techniques, can be broadly classified into two categories: dynamic techniques (that rely on run-time execution information) and static techniques (that operate directly on source and test code). Absent from this current body of work is a comprehensive study aimed at understanding and evaluating the static approaches and comparing them to dynamic approaches on a large set of projects. In this work, we perform the first extensive study aimed at empirically evaluating four static TCP techniques comparing them with state-of-research dynamic TCP techniques at different test-case granularities (e. g., method and class-level) in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and similarity of faults detected. This study was performed on 30 real-word Java programs encompassing 431 KLoC. In terms of effectiveness, {{we find that the}} static call-graph-based technique outperforms the other static techniques at test-class level, but the topic-model-based technique performs better at test-method level. In terms of efficiency, the static call-graph-based technique is also the most efficient when compared to other static techniques. When examining the similarity of faults detected for the four static techniques compared to the four dynamic ones, we find that on average, the faults uncovered by these two groups of techniques are quite dissimilar, with the top 10 % of test <b>cases</b> <b>agreeing</b> <b>on</b> only 25 % - 30 % of detected faults.

30|$|In {{a letter}} to F.A. Walker, Léon Walras claimed that the {{definition}} of entrepreneur was, under his point of view, “le nœud de toute l’économique” (Walras 1965). Entrepreneurship plays {{a fundamental role in}} the explanation of many economic phenomena, {{but at the same time}} there must exist few central economic concepts that have been understood and applied in such a diverse manner (Casson 1982, 1987; Casson et al. 2006). Thus, the entrepreneur is the agent who, in the search for profit, coordinates the markets –this is the case of Walrasian and neoclassical economics and, in a very especial sense, Austrian economics (Kirzner 1992)-; introduces new combinations in the economic life (Schumpeter (1932) [2005]; Schumpeter (1934) [1983]; assumes the risks involved in all the decisions that are taken in contexts of true uncertainty (Knight 1921); etc. In any <b>case,</b> economists <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> that the main contribution of the entrepreneur within the economy consists of increasing the productivity of the system through innovation. Moreover, it is pursuing their own interest (profits) that entrepreneurs coordinate and enhance the productivity of the economy thus promoting economic growth.|$|R
40|$|Often, {{processors}} and other buyers want the agricultural output they purchase to possess specific quality attributes. In some markets, government-sponsored or third-party grading may ensure adequate quality, {{even when the}} spot market is used. In others, buyers sign contracts with producers that specify the desired attributes. Contracts may also include provisions designed to induce producers to supply output with the desired traits. We discuss two such types of provisions: financial incentives, and buyer control of production inputs. We use the examples of the California processing tomato and winegrape industries to illustrate our analysis. Product Quality There are two general ways of describing quality. In the first <b>case,</b> everyone <b>agrees</b> <b>on</b> what constitutes high quality. For example, less material other than tomatoes (MOT- stems, dirt, etc.) constitutes higher quality for processing tomatoes.

30|$|An {{alternative}} to autocorrelation is a resonant filter bank consisting of resonators tuned to different frequencies (periodicities), first introduced for beat tracking by Scheirer in [5].

This is one reason why it is so difficult, even for most of state-of-the-art systems, to reliably detect the tempo on the beat level.

On the one hand, {{when it comes to}} proposing an interpretation of existing law and to convincing the “community of internationalists”, the positivist thought and reasoning is often used, if not systematically. Positivism offers a system of thought, a framework of premises, formulas and techniques, in brief a science, allowing to persons with different or opposing thoughts, cultures and values to discuss and the <b>case</b> being, to <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> normative conclusions. However, on the other hand, positivism, largely characterizing legal discourse or motivation that intervenes largely in a “downstream” manner, is not useful in order to dictate, in an “upstream” manner, decision making. Therefore, no one has been “positivist” for a long time now, if the expression means the belief that the interpretation and implementation of law can operate in a rational, objective and neutral manner, and thus without any judgement of values or opportunity intervening.

A study was under taken to assess the interobserver agreement of categorizing peripancreatic collections on computed tomography (CT) using the Atlanta classification. Methods: Preoperative contrast-enhanced CTs from 70 consecutive patients (49 men; median age, 59 years; range, 29 - 79 years) operated for acute necrotizing pancreatitis (2000 - 2003) in 11 hospitals were reviewed. Five abdominal radiologists independently categorized the peripancreatic collections according to the Atlanta classification. Radiologists {{were aware of the}} timing of the CT and the clinical condition of the patient. Interobserver agreement was determined. Results: Interobserver agreement among the radiologists was poor (kappa, 0. 144; SD, 0. 695). In 3 (4 %) of 70 cases, the same Atlanta definition was chosen.

40|$|International audienceCause-of-death {{statistics}} {{are a major}} source of information for epidemiological research or policy decisions. Information on the reliability of these statistics is important for interpreting trends in time or differences between populations. Variations in coding the underlying cause of death could hinder the attribution of observed differences to determinants of health. Therefore we studied the reliability of cause-of-death statistics in the Netherlands. We performed a double coding study. Death certificates from the month of May 2005 were coded again in 2007. Each death certificate was coded manually by four coders. Reliability was measured by calculating agreement between coders (intercoder agreement) and by calculating the consistency of each individual coder in time (intracoder agreement). Our analysis covered an amount of 10, 833 death certificates. The intercoder agreement of four coders on the underlying cause of death was 78 %. In 2. 2 % of the <b>cases</b> coders <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> a change of the code assigned in 2005. The (mean) intracoder agreement of four coders was 89 %. Agreement was associated with the specificity of the ICD- 10 code (chapter, three digits, four digits), the age of the deceased, the number of coders and the number of diseases reported on the death certificate. The reliability of cause-of-death statistics turned out to be high (> 90 %) for major causes of death such as cancers and acute myocardial infarction. For chronic diseases, such as diabetes and renal insufficiency, reliability was low (< 70 %). The reliability of cause-of-death statistics varies by ICD- 10 code/chapter. A statistical office should provide coders with (additional) rules for coding diseases with a low reliability and evaluate these rules regularly. Users of cause-of-death statistics should exercise caution when interpreting causes of death with a low reliability. Studies of reliability should take into account the number of coders involved and the number of codes on a death certificate...|$|R
40|$|The role of soil {{properties}} and their spatial {{distribution in the}} landscape are already recognised as crucial issues greatly affecting rainfall-runoff dynamics and hence landscape hydrology. This becomes even more important when hydrological monitoring data are lacking. This applies to the critical issue of making hydrological predictions for ungauged basins. The rapid development of hydropedology along with Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) is promising to both enhance our understanding and (spatial) prediction capacity of rainfall-runoff processes {{and to be a}} powerful tool for environmental policy research. Despite these developments and broad conceptualizations, the crucial point as to how the soil data from typically available soil mapping databases can be usefully employed by the hydrologist has yet to be addressed. This question implies detailed knowledge of {{the quality and quantity of}} information embedded in and behind a soil map. This work produced an analytical evaluation of the potential and limitations of soil data obtained through soil surveys and soil mapping. This evaluation is made from a landscape hydrology viewpoint and is also developed through the following Italian case studies: irrigation management at the district scale, assessment of groundwater vulnerability, flood peak forecasting, and land evaluation for maize production. We show that special care is required in handling soil database data if their full potential is to be achieved. Further, all the <b>case</b> studies <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> the appropriate degree of complexity of the soil hydrological model to be applied. We also emphasise that effective interaction between pedology and hydrology to address landscape hydrology requires (i) better awareness of the hydrologic community about the type of soil information behind a soil map or soil database, (ii) the development by the pedological community of a better quantitative framework for evaluating surveyed hydrological features, and (iii) quantitative information on soil spatial variability and, if possible, on the spatial distribution of prediction errors...|$|R

The objective of this study was to evaluate if postoperative complications related or not to size mismatch are more frequent after bilobect-omy compared with right lobectomy cases. METHODS: Retrospective case-control study on a series of matched non-small-cell lung cancer patients. Cases were patients who under-went right bilobectomy (upper and middle or lower and middle) and controls, patients who underwent right upper or lower lobectomy. Cases and controls were matched by propensity scoring according to site, age, ppoFEV 1, type of postoperative management (intensive physiotherapy or not), cardiac comorbidity and pT status. We selected two primary outcomes for comparison: occurrence of any cardio-respiratory complication and occurrence of any complication related to space discrepancies. For the latter, all complicated case records were reviewed and two blinded observers <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> the probability of each complication to be related to space discrepancies. Agreement was measured by the κ statistic. The overall odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for each outcome were calculated on 2 × 2 tables for the whole population and for cases with upper or lower resections. RESULTS: The study included 689 patients: 572 right lobectomy (419 upper and 153 lower) and 117 bilobectomy cases (30 upper and middle and 87 lower and middle).
