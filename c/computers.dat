5|$|Mainframe <b>computers</b> are <b>computers</b> used {{primarily}} by businesses and academic institutions for large-scale processes. Before personal <b>computers,</b> first termed microcomputers, became widely {{available to the}} general public in the 1970s, the computing industry was composed of mainframe <b>computers</b> and the relatively smaller and cheaper minicomputer variant. During the mid to late 1960s, many early video games were programmed on these <b>computers.</b> Developed prior to the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early 1970s, these early mainframe games were generally written by students or employees at large corporations in a machine or assembly language that could only be understood by the specific machine or computer type they were developed on. While many of these games were lost as older <b>computers</b> were discontinued, some of them were ported to high-level computer languages like BASIC, had expanded versions later released for personal <b>computers,</b> or were recreated for bulletin board systems years later, thus influencing future games and developers.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, {{mainframe}} <b>computers</b> and minicomputers {{were present}} in many academic research institutions and large companies such as Bell Labs. While the commercial video game industry did not yet exist at that point in the early history of video games and would not until the early 1970s, programmers at these companies created several small games to be played on their mainframe <b>computers.</b> Most of these spread only to other users of the same type of computer and therefore did not persist as older computer models were discontinued; several, however, inspired future games, or were later released in modified versions on more modern systems or languages. These early mainframe games were largely created between 1968 and 1971; while earlier games were created they were limited to small, academic audiences. Mainframe games also continued to be developed through the 1970s, but the rise of the commercial video game industry, focused on arcade video games and home video game consoles, followed by the rise of personal <b>computers</b> later in the decade, meant that beginning in the 1970s the audience and developers of video games began to shift away from mainframe <b>computers</b> or minicomputers, and the spread of general-purpose programming languages such as the BASIC programming language meant that later mainframe games could generally be run on personal <b>computers</b> with minimal changes, even if initially developed on a mainframe.|$|E

5|$|Early {{computer}} games {{began to be}} created in the 1950s, and the steady {{increase in the number}} and abilities of <b>computers</b> over time led to the gradual loosening of restrictions on access to mainframe <b>computers</b> at academic and corporate institutions beginning in the 1960s. This in turn led to a modest proliferation of generally small, text-based games on mainframe <b>computers,</b> with increasing complexity {{towards the end of the}} decade. While games continued to be developed on mainframes and minicomputers through the 1970s, the rise of personal <b>computers</b> and the spread of high-level programming languages meant that later games were generally intended to or were capable of being run on personal <b>computers,</b> even when developed on a mainframe. These early games include Hamurabi, an antecedent of the strategy and city-building genres; Lunar Lander, which inspired numerous recreations in the 1970s and 1980s; Civil War, an early war simulation game; Star Trek, which was widely ported, expanded, and spread for decades after; Space Travel, which played a role in the creation of the Unix operating system; and Baseball, an early sports game and the first baseball game to allow player control during a game.|$|E
