5|$|Boletus edulis {{constitutes}} a food source which, although not rich in easily absorbed carbohydrates or fat, contains vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Fresh mushrooms consist of over 80% moisture, although reported values tend to differ somewhat as moisture content <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by environmental temperature and relative humidity during growth and storage, {{as well as}} the relative amount of water that may be produced as a result of normal metabolic processes during storage.|$|E
5|$|Food {{politics}} are the political {{aspects of the}} production, control, regulation, inspection and distribution of food. The politics <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by the ethical, cultural, medical and environmental disputes concerning proper farming, agricultural and retailing methods and regulations. Food power {{is an integral part}} of the politics of food.|$|E
5|$|Lack of CSF {{pressure}} and volume can allow {{the brain to}} sag and descend through the foramen magnum (large opening) of the occipital bone, {{at the base of}} the skull. The lower portion of the brain is believed to stretch or impact one or more cranial nerve complexes, thereby causing a variety of sensory symptoms. Nerves that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> and their related symptoms are detailed in the table at right.|$|E

5|$|Many {{different}} mammalian species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by prion diseases, as the {{prion protein}} (PrP) {{is very similar}} in all mammals. Due to small differences in PrP between different species it is unusual for a prion disease to transmit from one species to another. The human prion disease variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, however, {{is believed to be}} caused by a prion that typically infects cattle, causing Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and is transmitted through infected meat.|$|E
5|$|Perl has a Turing-complete grammar because parsing <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by {{run-time}} code executed {{during the}} compile phase. Therefore, Perl cannot be parsed by a straight Lex/Yacc lexer/parser combination. Instead, the interpreter implements its own lexer, which coordinates with a modified GNU bison parser to resolve ambiguities in the language.|$|E
5|$|Some brain {{disorders}} such as Tay–Sachs {{disease are}} congenital, and linked to genetic and chromosomal mutations. A rare group of congenital cephalic disorders known as lissencephaly is characterised by the lack of, or inadequacy of, cortical folding. Normal development of the brain <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> during pregnancy by nutritional deficiencies, teratogens, infectious diseases, and {{by the use of}} recreational drugs and alcohol.|$|E
5000|$|Fractions, {{especially}} 1/2, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used {{where only}} natural numbers {{could be used}} before: casting costs, damage, life totals, mana, power, and toughness <b>can</b> all <b>be</b> <b>affected.</b>|$|R

5|$|The brain, {{although}} {{protected by}} the blood-brain barrier, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by infections including viruses, bacteria and fungi. Infection may be of the meninges (meningitis), the brain matter (encephalitis), or within the brain matter (such as a cerebral abscess). Rare prion diseases including Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and its variant, and kuru may also affect the brain.|$|E
5|$|Some affiliative {{behaviors}} are seasonal or gender-specific, {{such as the}} male squeal approach and anogenital inspections performed during the mating season. Another example is the female greeting behavior, where two females will use their anogenital scent glands to mark each other's backs, jump over one another, writhe together, and emit squealing vocalizations. This behavior is not seen during {{the end of the}} cool, dry season or around gestation. The frequency of other affiliative behaviors <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by age. All ruffed lemurs over five months of age allogroom, and, in captivity, subadults participate in play more frequently than adults.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunication and {{broadcast}} networks <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by volcanic ash {{in the following}} ways: attenuation and reduction of signal strength; damage to equipment; and overloading of network through user demand. Signal attenuation due to volcanic ash is not well documented; however, {{there have been reports}} of disrupted communications following the 1969 Surtsey eruption and 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. Research by the New Zealand-based Auckland Engineering Lifelines Group determined theoretically that impacts on telecommunications signals from ash would be limited to low frequency services such as satellite communication. Signal interference may also be caused by lightning, as this is frequently generated within volcanic eruption plumes.|$|E
5000|$|Likewise, a broad new {{definition}} for stakeholder {{was established in}} ISO 31000, [...] "Person or persons that <b>can</b> <b>affect,</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by, or perceive themselves to <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by a decision or activity." [...] It is the verbatim definition given for the term [...] "interested party" [...] as defined in ISO 9001:2015.|$|R

5|$|The {{distinction}} between viral {{upper respiratory tract}} infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms with the common cold affecting primarily the nose, pharyngitis the throat, and bronchitis the lungs. However, there can be significant overlap and multiple areas <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected.</b> The common cold is frequently defined as nasal inflammation with varying amount of throat inflammation. Self-diagnosis is frequent. Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed, and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} breed {{clubs in the}} UK {{supporting}} the breed, although it is registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club due to its low number of puppy registrations on a yearly basis. The breed is friendly but tough and is suitable for interaction with older children. There are no breed specific health concerns, but they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by spinal problems due to their elongated body and the breed is affected by canine cancer at a higher than average rate.|$|E
5|$|Two genetic health {{concerns}} {{seen in the}} breed are von Willebrand disease (vWD) and craniomandibular osteopathy (CMO); Scottie cramp, patellar luxation and cerebellar abiotrophy are also sometimes seen in this breed. Common eye conditions seen {{in a variety of}} breeds such as cataracts and glaucoma can appear in Scotties as they age. There are no specific conditions relating the skin that affect the breed, but they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by common dog related conditions such as parasites and mange. Scotties typically live from 11 to 13 years.|$|E
50|$|Interactions between {{different}} species <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by multilevel selection. Predator-prey relationships <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>affected.</b> Individuals of certain monkey species howl {{to warn the}} group of the approach of a predator. The evolution of this trait benefits the group by providing protection, but could be disadvantageous to the individual if the howling draws the predator's attention to them. By affecting these interspecific interactions, multilevel and kinship selection can change the population dynamics of an ecosystem.|$|R

5|$|When {{suffering}} from sleep deprivation, active immunizations {{may have a}} diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production, and a lower immune response, than would be noted in a well-rested individual. Additionally, proteins such as NFIL3, which {{have been shown to}} be closely intertwined with both T-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation, shift work, etc. As a result, these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} United States Supreme Court can {{overturn}} {{the decisions of}} the Oregon Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively based on the Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change the outcome of the case. The Oregon Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, decisions of the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).|$|E
5|$|Enemies, {{encountered}} in environments as icons, react differently {{depending on how}} they are approached and attacked: using the right attack or approaching them unawares grants the party an advantage in battle. If other groups of enemies are close by, they are also drawn into the initiated battle. For both player characters and enemies, battle skills and character performance <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> by elemental attributes. Status ailments can also be inflicted by both the party and enemies. They are divided into physical ailments and magical ailments, which {{have a variety of}} negative effects: physical effects can be effects like slowing or poisoning a character, while magical ailments can cause units to turn on their allies or automatically recover a knocked-out party member. Items used on characters can restore TP or HP, or remove status ailments. Characters learn new skills during battles, along with Titles that affect aspects of characters.|$|E
