5|$|Bohr became {{convinced}} that light behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, experiments confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves. He <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> philosophical principle of complementarity: that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties, such as being a wave or a stream of particles, depending on the experimental framework. He {{felt that it was}} not fully understood by professional philosophers.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, the United Daughters of the Confederacy <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway, a transcontinental {{highway to}} be built through the South. Portions of the highway's route in Virginia, Alabama and other states still bear the name of Jefferson Davis.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the long-standing}} controversies about Citizen Kane {{has been the}} authorship of the screenplay. Welles <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> project with screenwriter Herman J.

Mankiewicz based the {{original}} outline {{on the life of}} William Randolph Hearst, whom he knew socially and came to hate after being exiled from Hearst's circle.|$|E

Sonora <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> idea in Spokane's Central Methodist Episcopal Church while listening to a Mother's Day sermon.|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore County Planning Commission first <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> Baltimore Beltway as a county-level roadway {{project in}} 1949; by 1953 {{the project was}} taken over by the state due to slow {{progress}} at the county level. The project was included as part of the Interstate Highway System by 1956, increasing the speed of construction due to federal funds available.|$|E

For, to say that an idea is necessary is simply to affirm that we cannot <b>conceive</b> <b>the</b> contrary; {{and the fact that}} we cannot <b>conceive</b> <b>the</b> contrary of any belief may be a presumption, but is certainly no proof, of its truth.|$|R
5|$|The main {{characters}} reside in Los Angeles, California, in the United States, and {{were created by}} series executive producer and writer Kyle Killen, who <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> idea after creating and developing Lone Star for the Fox network. The portrayal of the Britten family was praised by television critics. Alongside the three main family members, several other characters were mentioned.|$|E
5|$|The programme's {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies, who <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> idea while researching for Casanova, described the episode as {{a love story}} for the Doctor.

5|$|While Edison {{seems to}} have <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> idea and {{initiated}} the experiments, Dickson apparently performed {{the bulk of the}} experimentation, leading most modern scholars to assign Dickson with the major credit for turning the concept into a practical reality. The Edison laboratory, though, worked as a collaborative organization. Laboratory assistants were assigned to work on many projects while Edison supervised and involved himself and participated to varying degrees.|$|E

5|$|Alton Towers <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> {{concept of}} a flying roller coaster in 1990, twelve years before Air {{eventually}} opened. Following the opening of Nemesis in 1994, a flying coaster was planned by the park to open in 1998, but was delayed due to technological limitations. During its development, Alton Towers marketed the ride as Secret Weapon 5 (abbreviated to SW5), following the naming pattern established for previous major park developments. The ride was developed in part by ride designer John Wardley, the producer of many attractions at Alton Towers and other former Tussauds Group theme parks.|$|E
5|$|Balzac <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> {{idea for}} the novel {{during a trip to}} Brittany {{arranged}} by a family friend in 1828. Intrigued by the people and atmosphere of the region, he began collecting notes and descriptions for later use. After publishing an Avertissement for the novel, he released three editions – each of them revised significantly. The first novel Balzac published without a pseudonym, he used many titles as he wrote and published, including Le Gars, Les Chouans ou la Bretagne il y a trente ans, and Le Dernier Chouan ou la Bretagne en 1800.|$|E
5|$|Bohr {{developed}} the Bohr {{model of the}} atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Carolyn Porco of NASA was {{consulted}} on {{the planetary}} science and imagery. The animators realistically recreated what an explosion {{would look like}} in space: short blasts, which suck inward and leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program was used to simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers of rocks and wind sucking into the planet. Unlike other Star Trek films and series, the transporter beam effects swirl rather than speckle. Abrams <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> redesign to emphasize the notion of transporters as beams that can pick up and move people, rather than a signal composed of scrambled atoms.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Knauf <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> initial {{script for}} the show between 1990 and 1992 when he was {{unsatisfied}} with {{his job as a}} Californian health insurance broker and hoped to become a screenwriter. He had always been interested in carnivals and noted that this subject had rarely been dramatized on film. Knauf's experiences of growing up with a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human strongly informed the story and its treatment of freaks.|$|E
5|$|David Mirkin <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> initial {{idea for}} the episode, Steve O'Donnell was the lead writer, and Steven Dean Moore directed. The writers drew on many groups to develop the Movementarians, but were principally {{influenced}} by Scientology, Heaven's Gate, the Unification Church ("Moonies"), the Rajneesh movement, and Peoples Temple. The show contains many references to popular culture, including the title reference to The Joy of Sex and a gag involving Rover from the television program The Prisoner.|$|E

5|$|During the Paris {{exposition}} in May 1910, Gaudí spent {{a holiday}} in Vic, where he designed two basalt lampposts and wrought iron for the Plaça Major of Vic {{in honor of}} Jaume Balmes's centenary. The following year he resided as a convalescent in Puigcerdà while suffering from tuberculosis. During this time he <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> idea for {{the facade of the}} Passion of the Sagrada Família. Due to ill health he prepared a will at the office of the notary Ramon Cantó i Figueres on 9 June, but later completely recovered.|$|E
5|$|Edwards <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> {{idea for}} the film after seeing {{fishermen}} attempt to bring a creature in with a net, and imagining a monster inside. He pitched the idea to Vertigo Films, who suggested he watch In Search of a Midnight Kiss, a low-budget film starring McNairy. Edwards cast McNairy and Able in the lead roles. Principal photography lasted three weeks and had a production crew of six people. Filming took place in five countries, and many locations were used without permission. Most of the extras {{were people who were}} at these locations during filming and were persuaded to act in it; all of their dialogue was improvised, and Edwards provided outlines of the primary plot points.|$|E
5|$|Farhan Akhtar <b>conceived</b> <b>the</b> idea {{to remake}} the iconic 1978 film {{of the same name}} after {{listening}} to a remixed version of a song from the original film. In early 2005, media started reporting that Akhtar was planning {{to remake the}} film, but rather than confirming the news, he revealed that though he was writing the screenplay based on the film, he would take the final decision after completing the script. The director co-wrote the film with his father, Javed Akhtar, who had also written the original film with Salim Khan.|$|E
