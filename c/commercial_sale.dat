40|$|If the Common European Sales Law (CESL) is adopted, {{commercial}} {{parties will}} have the opportunity to choose between two international legal instruments for the regulation of their international <b>commercial</b> <b>sales</b> contracts. Whereas CESL is available to both consumer and <b>commercial</b> <b>sales</b> contracts, the Vienna Sales Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is intended for <b>commercial</b> <b>sales</b> contracts only. This could suggest that CISG is more suitable for use in <b>commercial</b> <b>sales</b> contracts, as <b>commercial</b> parties usually have different interests compared to consumers. In this article, it is argued that, as CESL remedies major flaws in CISG, in fact CESL is the better choice (also) for commercial parties, in particular because it introduces coherent rules on defects of consent, clearer and more balanced rules regarding the incorporation of standard terms, and a scheme for the testing of the unfairness of standard terms...|$|R

25|$|Natural gas {{processing}} changes the commodity in two critical ways.

Steady growth has made natural gas a major industry, with 180 cubic kilometres of gas flowing from Canadian fields to market, every year.|$|E
25|$|Other {{stations}} in the Classic Hits group began as local commercial stations owned by the Government-owned Radio New Zealand, {{at a time when}} the New Zealand Government had a monopoly on the New Zealand radio market. In some regions, the station that would eventually become The Hits, was the only available radio station in that region. By the early 1990s, Radio New Zealand had switched most of their stations to FM but retained the stations original AM frequency for coverage in areas where the FM frequency could not be reached or for listeners with an AM only radio. The AM frequency was utilized for talkback and specialist shows in addition to the regular programming on the FM frequency. To cut costs and prepare the stations for <b>commercial</b> <b>sale,</b> Radio New Zealand began rebranding AM stations to Newstalk ZB and rebranding the FM stations as Classic Hits.

500|$|Despite being poor pets {{that are}} {{difficult}} to care for, with a dangerous toxic bite and a sleep cycle opposite to that of humans, a large number of slow lorises are traded as pets, both locally and internationally. Although it is illegal to import slow lorises for <b>commercial</b> <b>sale,</b> they are popular exotic pets in Japan, the United States, and Europe. This is mainly because of their [...] "cute" [...] appearance, popularized in highly viewed YouTube videos, which {{is due in part to}} their large eyes, adaptations to a nocturnal lifestyle. Hundreds of slow lorises have been confiscated at airports, but because they are easy to hide, these numbers are likely to be only a small fraction of the total number being trafficked. Traders cut or pull the teeth of slow lorises to make them appear to be an appropriate pet for small children, but this practice often leads to extreme blood loss, infection, and death. Slow lorises lacking their teeth would be unable to fend for themselves and therefore are not reintroduced into the wild. Most captive lorises in the pet trade also receive improper care and die from poor nutrition, stress, or infection. Despite this, demand has risen, and slow lorises are no longer captured opportunistically, but are now hunted on a commercial scale using flashlights, from which the animals do not flee.|$|E
