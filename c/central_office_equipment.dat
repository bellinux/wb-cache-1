5000|$|Call return {{allows a}} {{customer}} to dial a code that identifies the last incoming call. On {{some types of}} <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>equipment,</b> it announces the number and offers the call-back option; on others, it simply attempts a connection without an announcement.|$|E
50|$|A passive {{optical network}} (PON) is a {{point-to-multipoint}} FTTP network architecture in which unpowered optical splitters are used to enable a single optical fiber to serve up to 128 customers. A PON reduces the fiber and <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> required compared with point-to-point architecture.|$|E

50|$|A PON {{consists}} of an optical line terminal (OLT) at the service provider's central office (hub) {{and a number of}} optical network units (ONUs) or optical network terminals (ONTs), near end users. A PON reduces the amount of fiber and <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> required compared with point-to-point architectures. A passive optical network is a form of fiber-optic access network.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>central</b> <b>office</b> {{was located}} at Wilcomb’s General Store, and that {{consisted}} of a small manual switchboard. Mr. Wilcomb would answer an incoming telephone call and connect it manually to the party being called between waiting on customers in the store. In 1914 it was relocated to a building at the junction of routes 121 and 121A, adjacent to the old Glidden Tavern, and there it remained for 44 years. A new building was constructed at 7 Derry Road (Route 102) in 1957 to house new <b>central</b> <b>office</b> switching <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1963, Carlson Mining was a {{strip mining}} {{business}} with approximately 10 to 19 employees operating in New Castle, PA. The company's owner, Jack Carlson, purchased the abandoned Princeton Elementary School {{for use as}} a <b>central</b> <b>office</b> and <b>equipment</b> storage. After phasing out his Strip Mining operations, Jack Carlson began running a trucking service out of the building. He also began renting the building out to the public, and renovated two of the classrooms to be rented out as office space. The offices were used by ProTech Paving for several years.|$|R
50|$|Broadband {{open access}} has also brought on many {{questions}} of how services to competition is offered, such as unbundled access services {{sold to the}} new company. This includes services that {{can be hard to}} duplicate. The concept is like what service providers offer their own customers and having television, voice, and Internet service bundled into one package. Any competitor may rent office space in an incumbent's <b>central</b> <b>office,</b> place <b>equipment</b> to interconnect with their network, or purchase other related services. The company can offer the same deal to a competing company requesting use of their network and facilities. The new entrant has a right to purchase access to the incumbent on an unbundled basis. Getting unbundled services means the new entrant has the opportunity to invest in its own network and therefore spend less on buying everything wholesale. They are able to make a profit using their own equipment and do not have to spend it all on the incumbent hardware and software provided.|$|R
50|$|Projects {{covered by}} the Service Improvement Plan {{included}} upgrade of long distance circuits (often outdated microwave lines), replacement of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> (again, often outdated), replacement of assorted radio telephone service technologies with wireline service or fixed radio link wireless services providing direct dial capability, and extension of service to unserved customers, again, with wireline or fixed radio link wireless services.|$|E
50|$|When built, the {{building}} had its business office on the first floor, with space for customers to transact business with the phone company, public telephone booths, and rooms for long distance calls. The next 12 floors contained telephone equipment, such as long distance switchboards, other special switchboards, and dial <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> for the MAin, ATlantic, and BRidgeport central offices. There were also breakroom facilities and a lunch room for telephone operators who were off duty. The 14th, 25th, and 26th floors were mechanical floors. Finally, a tower on the 15th through 24th floors housed administrative offices of the telephone company. There were also three basement floors with power and heating equipment, along with cable vaults. The building measured 346 ft above street level, 42 ft in the basements, and had 26 stories. Many of these stories were somewhat taller than those in office buildings due {{to the size of}} <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>equipment.</b> The building had 24000 sq ft of floor space, and housed about 1,000 employees.|$|E
50|$|Central office {{multiplexing}} (or CO muxing) is {{telephone exchange}} (<b>central</b> <b>office)</b> <b>equipment</b> that derives {{a number of}} lower speed channels from one high-bandwidth channel. This type of multiplexing is needed when the customer wants to terminate the DS1 or DS3 in the central office and wants to ‘pick up’ lower level services. For example, a customer may order a DS3, using it to carry a number of DS1 level services from different IXC carriers.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, DID service used analog circuits. In {{these types}} of DID trunks the {{customer}} premises equipment provided signaling battery. The <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> detects {{the level of the}} line and disables service if the circuit is not operational. This is the reverse arrangement from standard plain old telephone service (POTS) lines for which the central office provides signaling and talk battery. Nowadays, it is far more common to deliver DID service on a Primary Rate Interface (PRI) circuit.|$|E
50|$|ISDN Digital Subscriber Line (IDSL) uses ISDN-based digital {{subscriber}} line technology to provide a data communication channel across existing copper telephone lines {{at a rate of}} 144 kbit/s, slightly higher than a bonded dual channel ISDN connection at 128kbit/s. The digital transmission bypasses the telephone company's <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> that handles analogue signals. IDSL uses the ISDN grade loop without Basic Rate Interface in ISDN transmission mode. The benefits of IDSL over ISDN are that IDSL provides always-on connections and transmits data via a data network rather than the carrier's voice network.|$|E
50|$|ColbaNet {{began as}} a Dial-up ISP, {{providing}} mainly 33.6k and 56k access in the late 90s and early 2000s. They also, like many others ISP providers, offered email, web hosting, and co-location. As broadband became more popular, they began providing ADSL-service by using Bell's wholesale network, like many independent ISPs do today in Quebec. Using this system, the copper wires and <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> is entirely Bell-owned and operated. Later some independent ISPs like ColbaNet started run their own servers and supply their own transit links. As such, they are not resellers, they simply rent Bell central office path/line to reach a customer.|$|E

50|$|Heat coils, {{also known}} as {{protector}}s, bugs or carbons serve as a surge protector between the telephone exchange and outside plant. They are commonly the last point of appearance for a telephone circuit before it leaves the office, for example on the outside plant side of the main distribution frame. On some competitive local exchange carrier circuits there are two heat coils, the extra one being {{at the point of}} interface between their circuit and where the incumbent local exchange carrier or Regional Bell Operating Company receives it. Their primary purpose is to protect <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> from surges of high voltage.|$|E
50|$|An orange box is a {{piece of}} {{hardware}} or software that generates caller ID frequency-shift keying (FSK) signals to spoof caller ID information on the target's caller ID terminal. It takes advantage of call waiting caller ID (also called off-hook caller ID) by mimicking the phone company's <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> and sending the call waiting tone followed by the audible caller ID data. An orange box {{can also be used to}} spoof Caller ID information sent after an incoming call rings, if the user has direct access to the target's phone line. One proposal to accomplish this involves an orange box used in conjunction with a magenta box, which in combination is called a vermilion box.|$|E
50|$|Scantlin Electronics reacted {{immediately}} to the Ultronic threat. In early 1962 they began work on their own computer-based system {{and put it into}} service in December, 1962. It used four Control Data CDC 160A computers in New York which recorded trading data in magnetic core memory. Major cities hosted <b>Central</b> <b>Office</b> <b>equipment</b> connected to newly designed Quotron II desk units in brokerage offices on which a broker could request, for any stock, price and net change from the opening, or a summary which included highs, lows, and volumes (later SEI added other features like dividends and earnings). The requests went to a Central Office, which condensed and forwarded them to the New York computer. Replies followed the sequence in reverse. The data was transmitted on AT&T's Dataphone high-speed telephone service. In 1963 the new system was accepted by many brokers, and was installed in hundreds of their offices.|$|E

40|$|A passive {{optical network}} (PON) is a point-to-multipoint, fiber to the {{premises}} network architecture in which unpowered optical splitters are used to enable a single optical fiber to serve multiple premises, typically 32. Telecommunications technology never stops progressing. As {{can be seen by}} the progress of standards from APONto BPON to GPON, and from EPON to GEPON, the industry is looking at ways to deliver even more bandwidth over longer distances than ever before. Two ways of doing this are by increasing the number of ptical wavelengths being used on the PON fiber, and by increasing the bandwidth and bandwidth efficiency of each wavelength. A PON configuration reduces the amount of fiber and <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> required compared with point to point architectures. All PON systems have essentially the same theoretical capacity at the optical level. The limits on upstream and downstream bandwidth are set by the electrical overlay, the protocol used to allocate the capacity and manage the connection...|$|E
40|$|Telecom {{networks}} {{constitute a}} significant part of Internet & Communication Technology (ICT). With the growth of traffic volume in telecom networks, the energy consumption and carbon footprint increase rapidly. Therefore, as the awareness of sustainable environment increases, all industries including Telco have started their green initiatives to reduce the energy consumption that will lead to the reduction of carbon emission. In general, typical telecom networks can be divided into several sections which are core, metro and access network. In this explanatory research, it aims to focus on the access network so called the “last mile”, to analyse the impact of Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) as fixed access network technology to power consumption and carbon footprint in Malaysia. In Malaysia, GPON is being deployed to provide broadband service; among other access technology such as Digital Subscriber Loop (DSL). GPON technology utilizes fiber optic to connect the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> (Optical Line Terminal-OLT) to the customer device (Optical Network Unit –ONU). By using deductive approach, secondary data from Telekom Malaysia’s (TM) network inventory list is used to determine the number of access network equipment deployed in the entire network.

40|$|There {{is concern}} that {{potentially}} harmful pollutants may be emitted from <b>office</b> <b>equipment.</b> Although <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> {{has been a}} focal point for governmental efforts to promote energy efficiency through programs such as the US EPA's Energy Star, {{little is known about the}} relationship between <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> use and indoor air quality, and information on pollutant emissions is sparse. In this review, we summarize available information on emission rates and/or ambient concentrations of various pollutants that are related to <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> use. Experimental methods used in the characterization of emissions are briefly described. The <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> evaluated in this review includes computers (desktops and notebooks), printers (laser, ink-jet and all-in-one machines) and photocopy machines. Reported emission rates of the following pollutant groups are summarized: volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), ozone, particulate matter and several semivolatile organic chemicals (SVOCs). The latter include phthalate esters, brominated flame retardants, organophosphate flame retardants and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We also review studies reporting airborne concentrations in indoor environments where <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> was present and thought to be a significant contributor to the total pollutant burden (offices, residences, schools, electronics recycling plants). For certain pollutants, such as organophosphate flame retardants, the link between emission by <b>office</b> <b>equipment</b> and indoor air concentrations is relatively well established. However, indoor VOCs, ozone, PAHs and phthalate esters can originate from a variety of sources, and their source apportionment is less straightforward. This literature review identifies substances of toxicological significance, with the purpose of serving as a guide to evaluate their potential importance with respect to human exposures...|$|R
