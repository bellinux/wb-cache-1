5000|$|Henrich's public profile {{was greatly}} raised with the {{publication}} in April 1989 of his book [...] "The <b>Custodial</b> <b>State.</b> On the Failure of Real-life Socialism" [...] ("Der vormundschaftliche Staat. Vom Versagen des real existierenden Sozialismus") There was at this time no question of anything so critical of the regime being published in East Germany: the book was published in West Germany where it received wide coverage in the broadcast and print media. The book's publication evidently {{came as a surprise}} to the authorities. It presented a devastating and detailed criticism of a state where socialism had not progressed beyond the [...] "larval stage" [...] ("Sozialismus im Larvenstadium") and the security services felt free to operate outside the law. In some ways it was a conscious follow-up to [...] "The Alternative", the publication of which in 1977 had led to its author's arrest and subsequent deportation, but twelve years on Rolf Heinrich was much more analytically pessimistic about the way ahead for Socialism in the German Democratic Republic than Rudolf Bahro had been. In East Germany Henrich was expelled from the ruling SED (party) and excluded from the [...] "Collective of Lawyers" [...] ("Kollegium der Rechtsanwälte") which effectively terminated, for the time being, his legal career in Eisenhüttenstadt. The widespread assumption was that Rolf Henrich, like Bahro, would now be arrested and then deported or [...] "sold" [...] to the west. That did not happen this time, however, possibly because behind the scenes the East Germany leadership hardliners were themselves struggling with a loss of self-confidence resulting from the political loosening now under way in the Soviet Union itself. Another explanation is that the regime was aware of the scale of the publicity Heinrich's book had already received both within and outside the German Democratic Republic and did not arrest him [...] "for political reasons".|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} I explore a narrow {{question}} that was raised, but not fully addressed, in the Questions relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite (Belgium v Senegal) case: does {{a state that has}} custody over a person who is suspected of the crime of torture, but that is unwilling or unable to prosecute that person itself, have an obligation to extradite that person to a state that seeks extradition, and that is able and willing to prosecute the suspect? The International Court of Justice (ICJ or Court) answered the question in the negative. The Court’s judgment exposes the fundamentally weak legal position of states that may have the strongest links with a suspect, and that may be best capable of prosecuting that person. The emergence of an absolutist obligation to prosecute of the <b>custodial</b> <b>state</b> has annihilated competing claims, whether or not these are based on a stronger link or better enforcement capabilities. Paradoxically, the result may be that a suspect may not be prosecuted at all...|$|E

To this effect, it analyses the regime determined under treaty law, customary law and {{general principles of law}} for the prosecution of core crimes. It examines whether the prohibition to commit core crimes embodies jus cogens and, if so, what consequences derive therefrom for the duty to prosecute perpetrators. Further, considering that the ICC was established in order to fill in lacunae of accountability derived from States’ unwillingness or inability to prosecute, the thesis scrutinizes the jurisdictional framework established by the Statute, in particular the principle of complementarity. On the basis of the study undertaken, it is argued that complementarity as determined in the Rome Statute is a specific materialization of a broader concept of complementarity. The thesis concludes that core crimes law has been motioned forth by the principle of substantive complementarity, which binds the <b>custodial</b> <b>State</b> to prosecute, where extradition is not feasible and international jurisdiction cannot step in, if necessary on grounds of universal jurisdiction. Finally, taking into account that the Statute of Rome articulates the mandate of the Court with the authority of the SC to maintain international peace and security, the thesis proposes a model of coordination of the competences of States, the ICC and the UN political organ, in accordance with the law of the Charter, the Rome Statute and peremptory norms of the international community. Against this backdrop, a systematic framework of the duty to prosecute core crimes is submitted, such that sovereignty and the principle mandating the fight against impunity are operatively reconciled...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{challenges}} of user involvement in social work are examined using descriptions of social work clients. The data comprise administrative documents and texts written by service users themselves. The administrative documents represent three different eras, going from the <b>custodial</b> <b>state</b> to the welfare state and the neo-liberalistic state of today. A total of 209 appeals service users made to the Social and Health Service Committee in 2007 were used as the service users voices. Michel Foucault's concepts of governmentality constitute the theoretical framework of this work. From the Foucauldian standpoint, social work {{can be considered as}} an essential tool of modern power. Through normalization social work helps the state to control different population groups in order to take care of economical growth, law and order and the welfare of the people. User involvement is examined as a social construction through the concepts of subject and object. The main analysis method used is content analysis. Some discourse analytic approaches are used to get deeper into the data. The main research finding is that the images of social work clients arising from administrative documents are contradictory. Three different discourses are going on at the same time: a custodian discourse, a service discourse and a user discourse. Despite the changes in the user's positions, users are still seen as objects and not as subjects. In addition to being objects of control, care and services, users are now also objects of activation and motivation. Meanwhile in appeals, service users describe themselves as subjects. They can temporarily be in need of help and support but still they are subjects, and not objects. In understanding user involvement in social work, there is a huge difference between users being seen as subjects or as objects. It is no wonder {{there has been so much}} discussion recently of how sers are treated. Quality work sees user involvement not only as an approach used by an individual employee but also as a characteristic of the organization. The administration of social work has an effect on how social workers work with their clients. Quality management and continuous improvement can help us to increase user involvement in social work. Through these means social work can become clearer, more transparent and even more measurable. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|Libertarian ideas won 2 ̆ 7 t {{help the}} {{disadvantaged}} gain back {{control over their}} lives, writes Paul O’Callaghan. When it comes to equality of opportunity, free market think tanker Charles Murray is a professional pessimist. He argues that there’s nothing governments can do to improve the life chances of disadvantaged citizens. His solution is {{to give up on}} early childhood interventions and welfare to work programs and rely on a system of unconditional cash payments instead. Murray wants us to accept that our society will always be unequal and to stop trying to change it. Murray is coming to Australia as a guest of the Centre for Independent Studies, a free market think tank devoted to making government smaller. Australian commentators often talk about the debate between Murray and his critics as if it were part of a larger debate between the right and left. That’s misleading. Many on the right, including some at the Centre for Independent Studies, disagree with Murray’s views. Murray is not a conservative or a generic ‘right winger’ — he’s a libertarian. As a libertarian he wants to radically limit the role of government. He’s less worried about how much it costs than he is about how much it does. In a 2001 interview with Susan Windybank of the Centre for Independent Studies he sketched an outlines of a libertarian plan to reform welfare: “Suppose that a deal could be struck with the Left saying we will bring everybody in the entire country above the poverty line and let’s say that poverty line has been defined in a way with which the Left agrees. That’s our part of the bargain. Everybody will have a cash income adequate to meet their needs. Your part of the bargain is to dismantle the institutions of the welfare state, the bureaucracies. Well, if the deal could be struck, if we could dismantle this very intrusive, expensive, unlovely welfare state apparatus, it would certainly have the effect of shrinking vastly the size of government and it’s affordable. ” In his 2006 book In Our Hands he developed the plan in more detail. The idea is to replace the welfare state with a no-strings-attached payment of 10, 000 a year. Under this plan there’d be no mutual obligation, no early childhood programs, no compulsory job search or training, and no services for the homeless. The only requirement is that recipients spend 3, 000 of their grant on health care. Murray worries that the alternative is a welfare state that becomes more intrusive and unlovely over time. In The Bell Curve, his 1994 book with Richard J. Herrnstein, Murray warned that American welfare policy was sliding towards a ‘custodial state’ where government provides the nation’s most disadvantaged citizens with basic necessities while their lives are strictly supervised. “It will be agreed that the underclass cannot be trusted to use cash wisely”, the authors write. “Therefore policy will consist of greater benefits, but these will be primarily in the form of services rather than cash. ” The disadvantaged will no longer be expected to manage their own lives or take responsibility for their own children. They and their children will become virtual wards of the state, trapped forever in the welfare system. Murray and Herrnstein’s prediction has resonance in Australia because many people fear this is exactly where our welfare policy has been heading with measures like the Northern Territory intervention and income management trials. Instead of cash, members of disadvantaged communities are given a BacicsCard that can only be spent on government approved goods. Income support is increasingly tied to compliance with bureaucratic demands. These policies are supported by both major parties so can’t easily be characterised as left or right. Fortunately, an obligation free handout or a permanent <b>custodial</b> <b>state</b> are not the only two alternatives for welfare policy. As economist James J Heckman points out, Murray’s mistake is to think that there’s nothing we can do to improve people’s skills and their ability to take control of their own lives. Murray believes that intelligence determines economic success and that this is largely determined by a person’s genes. Low IQ people tend to partner with other low IQ people and they tend have low IQ children. His claim that black Americans have a lower average IQ than whites triggered outrage when The Bell Curve was published. The <b>custodial</b> <b>state</b> is one response to this kind of pessimism while Murray’s abandonment of mutual obligation is another. What Heckman argues, however, is that it possible to work with disadvantaged parents and children to build up skills and reduce economic inequality. He stresses the importance of skills and personality traits that go beyond IQ. In a paper for the Boston Review he writes: “Contrary to the views of genetic determinists, experimental evidence shows that intervening early can produce positive and lasting effects on children in disadvantaged families. ” By focusing our efforts on disadvantaged families and communities we can move beyond the kind of paternalistic and illiberal policies Murray warns about. We can do a lot better than perpetually supervising people so they don’t damage themselves or their children; we can give them back control over their lives. As Heckman argues, the skills developed through effective interventions “empower people to be what they want to be and do not force them to make particular choices or adopt one way of life over another. ” The idea that government has the ability to expand equality of opportunity by working with highly disadvantaged children, families and communities shouldn’t be an ideological one. In Australia Heckman’s research has been cited approvingly by academics, the Productivity Commission and MPs on both sides of politics. Australia has also taken some small steps towards a preventative, early intervention approach with programs like Communities for Children that support children’s development by investing in parenting skills and strengthening families and communities. We could and should do much more. Despite Murray’s rhetoric about reinvigorating community, philanthropy and the spirit of volunteerism, these kinds of programs won’t survive without government support. We don’t fund our military, schools, and hospitals that way and we shouldn’t fund crucial social programs that way either. While volunteers have an important role in delivering successful social services, programs dealing with highly disadvantaged and vulnerable people require a high level of professional skill and experience. In a political environment dominated by opinion polls and focus groups, we can’t count on government to pay attention to things we don’t pay attention to. If we stop caring about the opportunities of Australia’s most disadvantaged families and communities then, chances are, the government will stop caring too. We need to demand that our governments reach out to people trapped in disadvantage and make sure everyone has a chance at success. And despite what Murray says, it is possible to expand equality of opportunity. Paul O’Callaghan Executive Director Catholic Social Services Australia Photo: Flickr / HazelMote...|$|E
40|$|Preventive-detention {{legislation}} {{has been introduced}} in various forms in legal systems {{around the world to}} allow for the ongoing detention or community supervision of sex offenders following the completion of their <b>custodial</b> sentences. The <b>stated</b> purpose of these laws is utilitarian: they are intended to protect the community and allow for the ongoing rehabilitation of the offender. However, judges and legal scholars have expressed concern that retributive, rather than utilitarian, motives might drive decisions regarding the ongoing management of sex offenders. These concerns align with psychological research on procedural and distributive justice. In this article, we review the relevant psychological literature, which shows that notions of morality and deservingness are key motives underlying justice reasoning and sentencing decisions. We discuss the ways in which retributive and utilitarian motives may impact upon preventive detention decisions, and how this psychological research can inform legal scholarship on the issues surrounding preventive detention...|$|R

The act also required GAO to study the feasibility of matching bankruptcy records with child support records to assure that filers with child support obligations are identified. GAO therefore (1) identified the percent of bankruptcy filers with obligations nationwide, (2) examined the potential for routine data matching to facilitate the identification of filers with child support obligations, and (3) studied the feasibility and cost of doing so. GAO interviewed child support enforcement and bankruptcy officials at the federal level and in six states.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to {{investigate}} the prospects for identifying and prosecuting individuals suspected of war crimes, within the process of exclusion from refugee status under article 1 F(a) of the 1951 Refugee Convention, and using subsequent mechanisms for extradition or prosecution in international criminal law. A number of principles within human rights law and public international law have been advocated by the UNCHR and several human rights NGOs as necessary for a thorough application of the exclusion clauses; one that takes individual responsibility into account and upholds the aims and purposes of the exclusion clauses. There is a discussion as to whether specialised or accelerated exclusion procedures are justified for reasons of security and efficiency, or if they put the rights of the individual at risk and limit the opportunities for gathering information to support investigation and prosecution of the crime in question. Apart from the instruments of asylum law and procedure that have emerged within the EU harmonisation process, there are no general, binding rules on the procedural aspects of the exclusion clauses. One principle that regulates the consequences for the individual of exclusion from refugee status and decisions on extradition is, however, the principle of non-refoulement. Although partly contested in state practice, there is widespread consensus in international jurisprudence and doctrine that the principle, following its status as a jus cogens rule, prohibits every state from returning any individual to a territory where he or she may face torture or other cruel and inhuman treatment or punishment, irrespective of any security risks that the individual may pose to the <b>custodial</b> <b>state.</b> Extradition or prosecution of individuals suspected of crimes under article 1 F(a), based on universal jurisdiction and the principle of aut dedere aut judicare, has gained increased support from international conventions, such as the 1948 Convention on Genocide and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The principles are widely upheld by human rights NGOs, and tendencies in practice and policy among the member states of the EU and the parties to the Rome Statute point towards the development of a customary rule of universal jurisdiction among these states. Continuing resistance to the Rome Statute and to universal jurisdiction among influential states such as the USA, Russia, China and India nevertheless serves to exclude these states from being bound by such an emerging customary rule of universal jurisdiction. There are compelling arguments as to why breaches of jus cogens-rules should include or give rise to erga omnes rights or obligations for all states to exercise universal jurisdiction over such breaches. Without the support of major states it is, however, difficult to establish the existence of the general state acceptance of universal jurisdiction as is required for the principle to attain jus cogens-status and become universally applicable, regardless of state consent. Future prospects for adequate and efficient identification and prosecution of suspected war criminals depend on the correct and thorough application of the exclusion clauses, in combination with the development of existing rules of universal jurisdiction, and not least on the willingness and ability of states to overcome the political, economic and institutional obstacles that presently may prevent many states from extraditing or prosecuting individuals who fall within the scope of article 1 F(a) of the exclusion clauses...|$|E
