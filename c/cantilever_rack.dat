50|$|A <b>cantilever</b> <b>rack</b> {{is a type}} of {{warehouse}} storage system consisting of the vertical column, the base, the arms, and the horizontal and/or cross bracing. These components are fabricated from both roll formed and structural steel. The horizontal and/or cross bracing are used to connect two or more columns together. They are commonly found in lumber yards, woodworking shops, and plumbing supply warehouses.|$|E
50|$|The Be-6 was a gull-winged {{aircraft}} {{with twin}} oval vertical stabilizers {{on top of}} a deep fuselage. The aircraft was of all-metal construction except for fabric covering the rudders and ailerons. The fuselage was divided into eight watertight compartments to improve survivability. The engines were installed in the bends of the wings, with the floats on an underwing <b>cantilever</b> <b>rack.</b> Each float was divided into four watertight compartments.|$|E

(hereinafter DCZ). This work results in the proposal of warehouse area and placement within the production, dispatch and warehouse hall, which includes the proposal of warehouse equipment with pallet and <b>cantilever</b> <b>rack</b> system...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{was done}} in {{collaboration}} with EAB situated in Smålandsstenar. In the initial discussion faze on doing a thesis with them {{there was a need}} to analyze and ensure the strength of an existing product, <b>cantilever</b> <b>racks.</b> This included performing FEM calculations on a model and comparing the results with physical tests. EAB has two models of <b>cantilever</b> <b>racks,</b> a light duty and a heavy duty. Within the heavy duty model series there are five product variants that differ in both size and load capacity. We will be working with the product variant with a load capacity of 1000 kg/arm which is the variant that {{is in the middle of}} the series. When we started work on the thesis we did a literature study and couldn’t find any well defined methodology that integrates both product development and computer aided design analysis. This meant that we had to combine and use both Freddy Olsson’s principle product development and known methods in FEM analysis. In the early stages of our work we also came to the conclusion that we need to compare our FEM analysis results to more than solely normal hand calculations, as these take into account many safety factor that will not be included in our computer aided model. So together with EAB we agreed to perform physical tests that will be similar in setup as our FEM analysis, leading to more comparable results. FEM analysis was conducted in CATIA V 5 Generative Structural Analysis and physical tests were carried out at EAB in their test facilit...|$|R
