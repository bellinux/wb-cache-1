5|$|<b>Casualties</b> <b>in</b> {{the battle}} are {{notoriously}} hard to calculate exactly. With only one exception (Scipion), records {{made by the}} French captains of their losses at the time are incomplete. The only immediately available casualty counts are the sketchy reports of Saint-André and the records made by British officers aboard the captured ships, neither {{of which can be}} treated as completely reliable. Most sources accept that French <b>casualties</b> <b>in</b> the campaign numbered approximately 7,000, including around 3,000captured, but these figures are vague and frequently do not agree with each other on details. British casualties are easier to confirm but here, too, there are some discrepancies; overall British casualties are generally given as around 1,200.|$|E

5|$|The advance {{brought the}} Strachwitz Battle Group hope of {{destroying}} the entire bridgehead. However, the spring thaw {{meant that the}} tanks were impossible to use.

The Germans lost 2,235 troops, dead and captured, in the offensive, while the total of German <b>casualties</b> <b>in</b> April, from all causes, was 13,274. Soviet <b>casualties</b> <b>in</b> April are unknown, but are estimated by Mart Laar {{to be at least}} 30,000 men from all causes. The losses exhausted the strengths of both sides.

Thus, LTC Dewey was the first American <b>casualty</b> <b>in</b> French Indochina).|$|R
