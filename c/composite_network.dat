40|$|We study self-assembled <b>composite</b> <b>networks</b> {{consisting}} of silk-like protein fibers dispersed {{in a soft}} gel matrix formed by collagen-like block copolymers. Rheological analysis shows that the <b>composite</b> <b>networks</b> have significantly higher storage moduli than either of the single networks. This is caused by bundling of the fibrils due to depletion attraction induced by the collagen-like polymers. Moreover, the soft background network significantly modifies the non-linear response of the fibrillar network; the strain-hardening disappears almost completely and the stress and strain at which the gel breaks increase strongly, resulting in tougher hydrogels. ...|$|R
40|$|The semiflexible {{polymers}} filamentous actin (F‑actin) {{and intermediate}} filaments (IF) both form complex networks within the cell, and together are key determinants of cellular stiffness. While {{the mechanics of}} F‑actin networks together with stiff microtubules have been characterized, the interplay between F‑actin and IF networks is largely unknown, necessitating the study of <b>composite</b> <b>networks</b> using mixtures of semiflexible biopolymers. We employ bulk rheology in a simplified in vitro system to uncover the fundamental mechanical interactions between networks of the 2 semiflexible polymers, F‑actin and vimentin IF. Surprisingly, co‑polymerization of actin and vimentin can produce <b>composite</b> <b>networks</b> either stronger or weaker than pure F‑actin networks. We show that this effect occurs through steric constraints imposed by IF on F‑actin during network formation and filament crosslinking, highlighting novel emergent behavior in <b>composite</b> semiflexible <b>networks...</b>|$|R

The composite nature of such networks leads to superior mechanical properties, but the origin of this mechanical synergism is still poorly understood. Here we study soft <b>composite</b> <b>networks,</b> made by mixing two self-assembling fiber-forming components. We find that the elastic moduli of the <b>composite</b> <b>networks</b> significantly exceed the sum of the moduli of the two individual networks. This mechanical enhancement is in agreement with recent simulations, where it was attributed to a suppression of non-affine deformation modes in the most rigid fiber network due to the reaction forces in the softer network. The increase in affinity also causes a loss of strain hardening and an increase in the critical stress and stain at which the network fails...|$|R

Many algorithms have been developed to predict function based on the integration of several data sources (e.g. genomic, proteomic, protein interaction, etc.), and testing on previously annotated genes indicates a high level of accuracy. Disadvantages of some function prediction algorithms have included a lack of accessibility, and the time required for analysis. Faster, more accurate algorithms such as GeneMANIA (multiple association network integration algorithm) have however been developed in recent years and are publicly available on the web, indicating the future direction of function prediction.|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we present a}} new method to {{simulate}} realistic three-dimensional networks of biopolymers under shear. These biopolymer networks are important for the structural functions of cells and tissues. We use the method to analyze these networks under shear, and consider the elastic modulus, the non-affinity during deformation, the normal modes and the density of states. We expand our analysis to <b>composite</b> <b>networks</b> consisting of stiff and floppy filaments. In the final chapter of the thesis we incorporate the thermal and viscous interactions of the surrounding medium in the calculations, and present {{the results of the}} simulations of the shear frequency dependence of the network response. We find that non-affine reorientations are important for understanding the network response. These non-affine reorientations make the networks relatively soft under shear and delay the onset of stiffnening. In <b>composite</b> <b>networks</b> non-affine reorientations allow for an intricate interplay between the stiff and floppy filaments. The frequency-dependent response shows a transition from a soft, non-affine regime at low frequencies to a stiff, close-to-affine response at high frequencies. Promotor: G. T.

40|$|Pectin and {{cellulose}} {{are major}} components of most primary cell walls, yet {{little is known}} about the way in which they interact either during assembly or in subsequent functional performance of the wall. As a mimic of cell wall assembly, we studied the formation of molecular composites formed by deposition of cellulose from Acetobacter xylinus into pectin/calcium systems, and the molecular, architectural and mechanical properties of the composites obtained. The formation of interpenetrating cellulose/pectin <b>composite</b> <b>networks</b> (as envisaged in current models for primary cell walls) required a pre-existing, but not too strong, pectin network. For pectin either in solution or strongly networked, phase separation from cellulose occurred, providing two physical models for the formation of middle lamellae. <b>Composite</b> <b>networks</b> showed no evidence of direct molecular interaction between the components, but pectin networks became more aggregated following deposition of cellulose into them. The shear strength under small deformation conditions for cellulose/pectin composites was very similar to that of cellulose alone. In contrast, under uniaxial tension, extensibility was greatly increased and stiffness decreased. These major changes were due to the effect of pectin on cellulose network architecture at deposition, as they were maintained upon removal of the pectin component. These results show that the presence and physical state of pectin at the time of cellulose deposition in muro may be a significant determinant of subsequent extensibility without compromising strength...|$|R

We study the intertwined propagation of two competing “memes ” (or viruses, rumors, products etc.) in a <b>composite</b> <b>network.</b> A key novelty is the use of a <b>composite</b> <b>network,</b> which in its simplest model is defined as a single set of nodes with two distinct types of edges interconnecting them.

To study the epidemic behavior of our system, we formulate it as a non-linear dynamic system (NLDS). We develop a metric for each meme that is based on the eigenvalue of an appropriately constructed matrix and argue that this metric {{plays a key role in}} determining the “winning ” meme. First, we prove that our metric determines the tipping point at which both memes become extinct eventually. Second, we conjecture that the meme with the strongest metric will most likely prevail over the other, and we show evidence of that via simulations in both real and synthetic composite networks. Our work is among the first to study the interplay between two competing memes in composite networks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we study}} the {{intertwined}} propagation of two competing “memes ” (or data, rumors, etc.) in a <b>composite</b> <b>network.</b> Within {{the constraints of}} this scenario, we ask two key questions: (a) which meme will prevail? and (b) can one influence {{the outcome of the}} propagations? Our model is underpinned by two key concepts, a structural graph model (<b>composite</b> <b>network)</b> and a viral propagation model (SI 1 I 2 S). Using this framework, we formulate a non-linear dynamic system and perform an eigenvalue analysis to identify the tipping point of the epidemic behavior. Based on insights gained from this analysis, we demonstrate an effective and accurate prediction method to determine viral dominance, which we call the EigenPredictor. Next, using a combination of synthetic and real composite networks, we evaluate the effectiveness of various viral suppression techniques by either a) concurrently suppressing both memes or b) unilaterally suppressing a single meme while leaving the other relatively unaffected...|$|E

This control system utilises an Artificial Neural Network model of the plant dynamics. The entire process was divided into two parts for modelling purposes. Separate models were trained; one for simulating the dynamics of the hot water heating loop and the second the dynamics of the heat exchanger circuit. The two sub-models, when concatenated, form a complete model of the plant referred to as a composite neural network model. The results of training and testing of the sub-models with various sets of plant data were presented. Of all the possible combination of sub-models, the best trained and tested sub-models were concatenated to form the best <b>composite</b> <b>network</b> model, and the combination of worst sub-models to form worst <b>composite</b> <b>network</b> model.
