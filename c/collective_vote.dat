50|$|In the {{political}} context the centuria was the constituent voting {{unit in the}} centuriate comices (Latin comitia centuriata), an old form of popular assembly in the Roman Republic, the members of which cast one <b>collective</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E
50|$|Votes {{were held}} in right of the states, rather than personally. Consequently, an {{individual}} ruling several states held multiple votes; similarly, multiple individuals ruling parts of the same state shared a single vote. These rules were not formalized until 1582; prior to this time, when multiple individuals inherited parts of the same state, they sometimes received a vote each. Votes were either individual or collective. Princes and senior clerics generally held individual votes (but such votes, as noted above, were sometimes shared). Prelates (abbots and priors) without individual votes were classified into two benches—the Bench of the Rhine and the Bench of Swabia — each of which enjoyed a <b>collective</b> <b>vote.</b> Similarly, Counts were grouped into four comital benches with a <b>collective</b> <b>vote</b> each — the Upper Rhenish Bench of Wetterau, the Swabian Bench, the Franconian Bench and the Westphalian Bench.|$|E
50|$|The county {{executives}} of Dutchess, Orange, Rockland, and Putnam counties also nominate one member each, but these members cast one <b>collective</b> <b>vote.</b> The Board also has six rotating nonvoting seats held {{by representatives of}} MTA employee organized labor and the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, {{which serves as a}} voice for users of MTA transit and commuter facilities.|$|E

Nevertheless, the <b>collective</b> <b>vote</b> of the cities initially was of inferior importance until a 1582 Recess of the Augsburg Diet. The college was led by the city council of the actual venue; with the implementation of the Perpetual Diet in 1663, the chair passed to Regensburg.|$|E

50|$|Each {{member of}} the Princes' College held either a single vote (Virilstimme) or a <b>collective</b> <b>vote</b> (Kuriatstimme). Due to the Princes, their single vote from 1582 {{strictly}} depended on their immediate fiefs; this principle led to an accumulation of votes, when one ruler held several territories in personal union. Counts and Lords only were entitled to collective votes, they therefore formed separate colleges like the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts and mergers within the Swabian, the Franconian and the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circles. Likewise, on the ecclesiastical bench, the Imperial abbots joined a Swabian or Rhenish college.|$|E
5000|$|Founded in 1969 as a capping stunt, bFM was {{a pirate}} student radio station, {{broadcast}} from a boat - which ran aground in Auckland's Waitemata Harbour - and played illegally on speakers around the University. The iconic ‘b’ originally stood for [...] "bosom". The station was originally run as an AUSA club {{but by the}} mid-1980s had seven staff (paid a nominal wage) and 100+ volunteers. All staff were voted into their position by <b>collective</b> <b>vote</b> - the collective being the staff and volunteers of the station at the time, with the appointments ratified by the AUSA.|$|E
50|$|The Princes of the Empire ranked {{below the}} seven Prince-electors {{designated}} by the Golden Bull of 1356 (and later electors), but above the Reichsgrafen (Counts), Freiherren (barons) and Imperial prelates, who formed with them the Imperial Diet assemblies, but held only <b>collective</b> <b>votes.</b> About 1180 the secular Princes comprised the Herzöge (Dukes) who generally ruled larger territories within the Empire {{in the tradition of}} the former German stem duchies, but also the Counts of Anhalt and Namur, the Landgraves of Thuringia and the Margraves of Meissen.|$|R
50|$|Malawi {{belongs to}} Africa Group 1, the IMF's largest {{constituency}}, along with 22 other nations. The constituency {{as a whole}} yields 2.97 percent of the <b>collective</b> <b>voting</b> power within the fund, and unlike other large constituencies, this one is egalitarian. Maxwell M. Mkwezalamba, Malawi's former Minister of Finance, currently serves the constituency as the Executive Director. South Africa and Nigeria's votes far outweigh the contribution of votes from Malawi, but because the chair rotates between all constituents, Malawi {{has the opportunity to}} serve as the Executive Director.|$|R
50|$|It {{had been}} thought, for many years, that the Lords voted by division. But {{research}} has demonstrated that the vote in the case was taken by a <b>collective</b> voice <b>vote,</b> and thus without knowing how many Lords voted, their names, or how they each voted.|$|R
50|$|At the 1997 general election, the SDP {{suffered}} significant electoral setbacks. Both Ling and Cheo {{were defeated}} in their bids for re-election, leaving the party with no MPs. Chee {{was defeated by}} the PAP's Matthias Yao (who he had publicly challenged to stand against him) in a high-profile contest in the MacPherson constituency. Only two opposition MPs were elected - with Chiam retaining his Potong Pasir seat as a Singapore People's Party candidate, and Hougang also being retained by Low Thia Khiang of the Worker's Party. The <b>collective</b> <b>vote</b> for opposition parties dropped from 40% to 35%. No SDP member has been elected to Parliament since then (and Chiam and Low were also the only opposition MPs returned to Parliament at the 2001 and 2006 general elections).|$|E
5000|$|Twelve engaged couples {{touch down}} at the luxurious Turtle Bay resort in Hawaii, ready to battle it out for a $100,000 dream {{destination}} wedding and a $25,000 nest egg. One problem: instead of staying {{in the lap of}} luxury, they learning they'll be living deep in the jungle in open air huts. Shocked couples quickly realize war is hell and attack with full force; first competing for bridal gowns and tuxes in a gift challenge, and later the coveted [...] "cake topper" [...] in a security challenge. Strategies and groups start to form as one couple tries {{to take control of the}} camp early. But in the end, it's up to all the couples, because a <b>collective</b> <b>vote</b> determines the first casualty of this Wedding War.|$|E
5000|$|In 1789, the Estates General {{was summoned}} {{for the first}} time since 1614. As Fénelon had wished in former days, an Assembly of Notables in 1787 (which already {{displayed}} great independence) preceded the Estates General session. According to the model of 1614, the Estates General would consist of equal numbers of representatives of each Estate, but the Third Estate demanded, and ultimately received, double representation, which they already had in the provincial assemblies. When the Estates General convened in Versailles on 5 May 1789, however, it became clear that the double representation was something of a sham: voting was to occur [...] "by orders", which meant that the <b>collective</b> <b>vote</b> of the 578 representatives of the Third Estate would be weighed the same as that of each of the other Estates.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} posting and voting {{activities}} of reddit’s users and show how these {{interact with the}} site’s structure {{to create an environment}} where information activists could build a resource base to oppose the 2012 US House of Representatives bill, Stop Online Privacy Act (SOPA). The broadcasting function of the ‘Front Page’ was important in raising awareness of SOPA among reddit’s users. Broadcasting the outcomes of <b>collective</b> <b>voting</b> back to the voters establishes an attentional feedback loop, and this imbued the collective action which followed with certain characteristics. Continuing a longitudinal investigation into changes in the ways that user attention and activity is distributed between the site’s 240, 000 ‘subreddits’, we conclude by theorizing whether such collective action will be possible on the reddit of the present...|$|R

5000|$|On 5 May 1789, amidst general festivities, the Estates-General {{convened in}} an {{elaborate}} but temporary Île des États {{set up in}} one of the courtyards of the official Hôtel des Menus Plaisirs in the town of Versailles near the royal château. With the étiquette of 1614 strictly enforced, the clergy and nobility ranged in tiered seating in their full regalia, while the physical locations of the deputies from the Third Estate were at the far end, as dictated by the protocol. When Louis XVI and Charles Louis François de Paule de Barentin, the Keeper of the Seals of France, addressed the deputies on 6 May, the Third Estate discovered that the royal decree granting double representation also upheld the traditional voting [...] "by orders", i.e. that the <b>collective</b> <b>vote</b> of each estate would be weighed equally.|$|E
50|$|In {{traditional}} theatre, {{performance is}} limited to a designated stage area and the action of the play unfolds without any interplay with audience members, who function as passive observers. Conversely, in interactive theatre, the performance engages audience members directly, making them active participants in the piece. Interactive theatre often {{goes hand in hand with}} immersive theatre, which brings the audience into the same playing space as the performers, obliterating any walls that separate the audience from the performers. They may be asked to hold props, supply performance suggestions (as in improvisational theatre), share the action's real-world (non-theatrical) setting (as in Site specific theatre and immersive theatre), or become characters in the performance. In addition the audience may be asked to participate in altering the course of the play altogether by taking part in a <b>collective</b> <b>vote</b> to help steer the plot in a new direction, as with Augusto Boal's forum theatre. In therapeutic and educational settings, the audience may even be invited to discuss pertinent issues with the performers.|$|E
5000|$|In February, {{when the}} LIMUN conference takes place, {{directors}} and delegates {{of a specific}} committee convene to let debate take its course. The sizes of committees differ very much from, for instance, the 15 members of the Security Council to about 70 in DISEC, but the rules are broadly the same, except for special agencies like the ICJ. Delegates, who each represent a country, are the speakers of the committee and give course to debate: by <b>collective</b> <b>vote</b> they determine in what order of topics the agenda is set, what to discuss, when and for how long, and ultimately which proposed resolutions are to be accepted and which are not. Directors, for their part, regulate the debate by choosing which speakers to entertain and at times suggesting potential courses of action. They also review Working Papers (delegates’ very rough drafts of resolutions to {{be presented to the}} committee), Draft Resolutions (proposed resolutions) and Amendments (suggested modifications to draft resolutions) upon their submission. Below follows a general outline of a committee-sessions’ flow of debate: ...|$|E
5000|$|Israel {{uses the}} closed-list method of party-list {{proportional}} representation; thus citizens vote for their preferred party {{and not for}} any individual candidates. The 120 seats in the Knesset are then assigned (using the D'Hondt method) proportionally to each party that received votes, provided that the party gained votes which met or exceeded the electoral threshold. [...] Parties are permitted to form electoral alliances so as to gain enough <b>collective</b> <b>votes</b> to meet the threshold (the alliance as a whole must meet the threshold, not the individual parties) and thus be allocated seats. The low threshold makes the Israeli electoral system more favourable to minor parties than systems used in most other countries. Two parties can make an agreement so that both parties' sum of surplus votes are combined, and if the combined surplus votes amount to an extra seat, the extra seat goes to the party with the greater number of surplus votes.|$|R
