5|$|Ongoing {{problems}} with avionics systems were {{addressed in the}} Jolly Well program, completed in 1964, which improved components of the AN/ASQ-38 bombing navigational computer and the terrain computer. The MADREC (Malfunction Detection and Recording) upgrade fitted to most aircraft by 1965 <b>could</b> <b>detect</b> failures in avionics and weapons computer systems, and was essential in monitoring the Hound Dog missiles. The electronic countermeasures capability of the B-52 was expanded with Rivet Rambler (1971) and Rivet Ace (1973).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the Chinese First Phase Campaign, the UN {{planners}} still believed that China had not intervened in Korea on a large scale. The suddenness of the Chinese withdrawal {{in the face of a}} victory further reinforced this belief. Working on the assumption that only 30,000 Chinese troops could remain hidden in the hills, General Douglas MacArthur ordered the bombing of the bridges over the Yalu River in an effort to cut off Chinese reinforcements. Confident that the UN air force <b>could</b> <b>detect</b> and disrupt any troop movements across the Yalu River, MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive on November 24 to rout the remaining Chinese and North Korean forces and to end the Korean War.|$|E

5|$|During late 1969, Phase IV sensors {{began to}} be {{deployed}} in-theater. These had {{a greater number of}} available communications channels, which allowed the seeding of a larger sensor field without fear of signal interference. By 1971–1972 a new sensor with a commandable microphone (COMMMIKE III) and another with a vehicle ignition detector (EDET III, which <b>could</b> <b>detect</b> the unshielded ignition systems of gasoline engines) were introduced. In 1972 U.S. dollars the ADSID cost $619.00, the ACOUSID $1,452.00, and the engine detector $2,997.00. During the life of the operation approximately 20,000 sensors were deployed in Laos.|$|E
5|$|In 132, Zhang {{introduced}} an intricate seismoscope to the court, which he claimed <b>could</b> <b>detect</b> the precise cardinal {{direction of a}} distant earthquake. On one occasion his device indicated that an earthquake had occurred in the northwest. As there was no perceivable tremor felt in the capital his political enemies were briefly able to relish the failure of his device, until a messenger arrived shortly afterwards to report that an earthquake had occurred about 400km (248mi) to 500km (310mi) northwest of Luoyang in Gansu province.|$|E
5|$|Rigorous {{attempts}} to warn of tornadoes {{began in the}} United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm. However, {{with the advent of}} weather radar, areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public tornado warnings were issued in 1950 and the first tornado watches and convective outlooks in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that hook echoes are associated with tornadoes. By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists <b>could</b> <b>detect</b> thunderstorms probably producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} washing of sputum on {{detection}} of pneumococcal capsular antigen was investigated. A total of 357 sputa from 104 patients was tested. Antigen <b>could</b> be <b>detected</b> in 164 (46 %) of the sputa {{in both the}} washed and unwashed portions, and <b>could</b> not be <b>detected</b> in either portion in a further 180 (50 %) sputa. Four (1 %) of the sputa agglutinated in the negative control, and {{were considered to be}} auto-agglutinating. In 9 (3 %) sputa antigen <b>could</b> be <b>detected</b> in the unwashed portion, but not in the washed portion. There were no specimens in which antigen <b>could</b> be <b>detected</b> in the washed portion only.

5|$|The North Vietnamese {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} the sensors was swift. If PAVN troops <b>could</b> <b>detect</b> the general location of a sensor, they immediately began to search out others and destroy them. Another response was to simply avoid them. The final evolution of anti-sensor measures was to attempt to deceive them. The chief protection of the sensors proved to be the dense foliage that covered the majority of the logistical system, turning the enemy's chief protection against him. Doubtless, PAVN troops negated the effects of many sensors, but so many of them were sown over such {{a long period of time}} that the majority survived.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{had very}} large {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves {{relative to their}} brain size, the organs responsible for {{a heightened sense of}} smell. This suggests that the sense of smell was highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs <b>could</b> <b>detect</b> carcasses by scent alone across great distances. The sense of smell in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that Tyrannosaurus rex had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.|$|E
5|$|A {{subcommittee}} of the S-1 Executive Committee, chaired by James B. Conant, and consisting of himself, Arthur Compton and Harold Urey, was appointed {{to look into the}} issue, and it similarly assessed the danger as low, but still sufficient to warrant taking some precautions. A program was initiated by the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and the Victoreen Instrument Company in Cleveland to develop radiation detection devices suitable for use in the field. Some 48 portable detection meters were built in 1943, half of which were capable of detecting 0 to 10 roentgens per day, while the other half <b>could</b> <b>detect</b> from 0 to 100 roentgens per day. Instruments sets were stored at Manhattan District offices in Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and the area engineer and some other officers were instructed in their use. A special team of scientists was created at the Metallurgical Laboratory who could respond to any reports of the use of nuclear weapons or radioactive poisons.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and AmpC beta-lactamases (derepressed and inducible), alone and in combination, <b>could</b> be <b>detected</b> in unidentified members of the Enterobacteriaceae using a simple, overnight disc diffusion test. METHODS: The genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in cephalosporin-resistant wild-type (n = 140) and culture collection (n = 140) isolates of Enterobacteriaceae was determined using PCR. A scheme for detecting these resistance mechanisms phenotypically was devised using five antibiotic discs: cefpodoxime +/- clavulanate; cefepime +/- clavulanate and cefoxitin. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: AmpC beta-lactamases (derepressed and inducible) and ESBLs, alone and in combination, <b>could</b> reliably be <b>detected</b> using a disc diffusion method. ESBLs alone <b>could</b> be <b>detected</b> {{on the basis of}} a difference of > 5 mm between cefpodoxime/clavulanate and cefpodoxime (10 microg) discs. ESBLs, in the presence of AmpC beta-lactamases, <b>could</b> be <b>detected</b> using a difference of > 5 mm between cefepime/clavulanate and cefepime (30 microg) discs. AmpC beta-lactamases <b>could</b> be <b>detected</b> using a difference of > 14 mm between cefepime/clavulanate and cefpodoxime/clavulanate discs. Inducible AmpC beta-lactamases could be discerned by observing the blunting of the cefpodoxime or cefpodoxime/clavulanate zones in proximity to cefoxitin (30 microg) discs...|$|R

5|$|Additionally, {{despite the}} initial {{positive}} {{response to the}} Geneva experts' report, data gathered from Hardtack operations of 1958 (namely the underground Rainier shot) would further complication verification provisions as US scientists, including Hans Bethe (who backed a ban), became convinced that the Geneva findings were too optimistic regarding detection of underground tests, though Macmillan warned that using the data to block progress on a test ban might be perceived in the public as a political ploy. In early 1959, Wadsworth told Tsarapkin of new US skepticism towards the Geneva System. While the Geneva experts believed the system <b>could</b> <b>detect</b> underground tests down to five kilotons, the US now believed that it could only detect tests down to 20 kilotons (in comparison, the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima had an official yield of 13 kilotons). As a result, the Geneva detection regime {{and the number of}} control posts would have to be significantly expanded, including new posts within the Soviet Union. The Soviets dismissed the US argument as a ruse, suggesting that the Hardtack data had been falsified.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she <b>could</b> <b>detect</b> as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that <b>could</b> <b>detect</b> anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet. The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E

5|$|The USCG cited topside damage as a {{reasonable}} alternative reason for Fitzgerald sinking and surmised that {{damage to the}} fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log. Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something broke loose from Fitzgeralds deck. He theorized {{that the loss of}} the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley <b>could</b> <b>detect</b> in the pilothouse let water flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage Fitzgerald experienced at 3:30p.m. on November 10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious explanation for why she sank.|$|E
5|$|Even by May 1943 Mark II ASV (Air-to-surface-vessel) {{was still}} being used. By then the German Metox {{receivers}} <b>could</b> <b>detect</b> the 1.5m radiations. A variable condenser was installed as an interim solution to reduce {{the strength of the}} signal. This gave U-boats the impression the aircraft was moving away from it. There was a radical change in 1943 with radar equipment when the ASV Mark III was becoming available. Based on RAF Bomber Command's H2S, it transmitted a much shorter wavelength of 9.1cm instead of 1.5m as with Mark Is and IIs and could not be detected by Metox receivers in U-boats. Instead of fixed aerials there was a rotary scanner, and thus the return signals gave a visual trace through 360 degrees on a CRT known as the Plan Position Indicator (PPI). The Mark II would only cover a forward arc, unlike the Mark III. The Mark III would indicate surface vessels via a dot on the screen while the coast would be given in the shape of an outline. Targets remained visible on the screen to within a quarter of a mile. The Mark III also suffered much less from 'sea return' obscuring targets at short range.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the U-boats in May 1943 did not signal {{the end of the}} Battle of the Atlantic. Some 60 vessels remained, and posed a threat to convoys. In later months, the Schnorchel, a device {{originated}} by the Dutch and later adopted by the Kriegsmarine after the Germans invaded the Netherlands were capable of allowing a U-boat to replace its air supply and vent its diesel exhaust without surfacing became available. However, it was sensitive to the weather, and put immense pressure and strain on crews who had to remain submerged for long period in hostile waters. Further, Coastal's Mark III radar <b>could</b> <b>detect</b> the mast. The smoke emitted was visible from 1,000 feet. In some cases the mast itself could be seen, some one foot in diameter, projecting two feet and moving at 12–15 knots. The technological response was to use High Tea, a series of sonobuoys dropped by aircraft onto the surface of the sea to detect U-boats. By late 1943, the U-bootwaffe was losing 20 percent of its strength per month. Some 70 percent that did return were seriously damaged.|$|E
