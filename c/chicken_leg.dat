The eagle was sent to Auburn by the Talladega County Agent along with a load of turkeys. It was first taken to the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house where it refused a cold <b>chicken</b> <b>leg</b> but made fast work of a live chicken. After a short stay {{in one of the}} Wildlife Department's animal pens, the eagle was moved into a cage built by the Auburn's Delta Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega fraternity. This would begin a 40-year period where Alpha Phi Omega was the bird's primary caretaker.|$|E

60|$|Before {{examining}} these, {{remember there}} are mainly two sorts of joints {{in the framework}} of the bodies of animals. One is that in which the bone is thick at the joints and thin between them, (see the bone of the next <b>chicken</b> <b>leg</b> you eat), the other is that of animals that have shells or horny coats, in which characteristically the shell is thin at the joints, and thick between them (look at the next lobster's claw you can see, without eating). You know, also, that though the crustaceous are titled only from their crusts, the name 'insect' is given to the whole insect tribe, because they are farther jointed almost into sections: it is easily remembered, also, that the projecting joint means strength and elasticity in the creature, and that all its limbs are useful to it, and cannot conveniently be parted with; and that the incised, sectional, or insectile joint means more or less weakness,[43] and necklace-like laxity or license in the creature's make; and an ignoble power of shaking off its legs or arms on occasion, coupled also with modes of growth involving occasionally quite astonishing transformations, and beginnings of new life under new circumstances; so that, until very lately, no mortal knew what a crab was like in its youth, the very existence {160} of the creature, as well as its legs, being jointed, as it were and made in separate pieces with the narrowest possible thread of connection between them; and its principal, or stomachic, period of life, connected with its sentimental period by as thin a thread as a wasp's stomach is with its thorax.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Short (20 sec) {{exposure}} to steam of 170 samples of whole and cut-up {{chicken in a}} chamber at 180 to 200 C reduced the aerobic plate counts by 1 to 3 log 10 units and Salmonella contamination by 50 % when compared to die indigenous flora in matched controls. The incidence of Salmonella contamination in <b>chicken</b> <b>legs</b> declined from 26 % (untreated) to 6 % (treated), whereas no marked decreases were observed with whole carcasses (15 to 20 %) and chicken wings (40 to 30 %). These results suggest that short steam treatments {{could be used to}} increase the shelf-life of whole and cut-up chicken and to decrease the incidence of salmonellae in <b>chicken</b> <b>legs.</b> (Key words. - Salmonella, steam, decontamination, poultry...|$|R
40|$|Chicken meat {{freshness}} is {{in permanent}} attention for all partners involved in food chain. In this paper {{we want to}} highlight the variation of microbiota (psychrotrophic and total viable count) and the variation of biogenic amines in chicken red and white meat. We compared the two anatomical parts of chicken because they have different metabolism, and after cutting from the carcasses they can suffer microbial contamination in the process. The {{purpose of the study}} is the evaluation of refrigerated white and red chicken meat (breast and legs) quality using biogenic amines and microbiota. The psychrotrophic microorganisms were initially around a value of 4 log CFU/cm 2 in both anatomical parts, when total viable count were determined around a value of 5 log CFU/cm 2. The microbial load growth until the seventh day, predominant for chicken breast being the psychrotrophic microorganisms, and for <b>chicken</b> <b>legs</b> remaining the total viable count. We studied the most five well-known biogenic amines: histamine, cadaverine, putrescin, spermine and spermidine. Theirs variation during storage was as follows: histamine increased slowly, spermine decreased, spermidine decreased, cadaverine and putrescin increased. Cadaverine was not detected until the fifth day for both <b>chicken</b> <b>legs</b> and breasts and putrescin was not detected until third day and only for <b>chicken</b> <b>legs...</b>|$|R
