5|$|According to game creator Steven Howse, he was {{inspired}} to create the game while he was experiencing financial problems. As {{a result of these}} financial issues, he had to move from Minneapolis to Michigan, where he realized the popularity of Agar.io. He had long wanted to create an online multiplayer game, but the only option for the development at the time was in Adobe Flash, and not wanting to use this method, he gave up the idea for a while. Howse finally created the game when he realized that WebSocket, a low-latency protocol supported by most major browsers, was sufficient and stable enough to run an HTML game similar to other games such as Agar.io. The most difficult part of the development was in making each server stable enough to handle 600 players at a time. Howse struggled to find space on servers with enough space in regions where there was more demand and tried to avoid <b>cloud</b> <b>services</b> like Amazon Web Services, owing to the high cost that these services would incur based on the amount of bandwidth used.|$|E

30|$|The {{reactive}} {{nature of}} the rule-based systems allows them to scaled-in or scaled-out a <b>cloud</b> <b>service</b> {{as soon as the}} performance of the <b>cloud</b> <b>service</b> reaches a predefined threshold. However, it takes between 5 and 15  min to boot-up a new VM and scaled-out the <b>cloud</b> <b>service</b> [4 – 6]. During the VM boot-up time the <b>cloud</b> <b>service</b> will be in the under-provisioning condition which may cause SLA violations. Therefore, the main shortcoming of the reactive auto-scaling systems (including the rule-based systems) is neglecting the VM boot-up time. The proposed auto-scaling system forecasts the future workload of the <b>cloud</b> <b>service</b> and generates the scaling requests ahead of time. This way, a new VM will be ready before the workload surge arrives to the <b>cloud</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R

25|$|Windows 8, the {{successor}} to Windows 7, was released generally on October 26, 2012. A number of significant changes were made on Windows 8, including {{the introduction of a}} user interface based around Microsoft's Metro design language with optimizations for touch-based devices such as tablets and all-in-one PCs. These changes include the Start screen, which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually updated information, and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch-based devices. Other changes include increased integration with <b>cloud</b> <b>services</b> and other online platforms (such as social networks and Microsoft's own OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) and Xbox Live services), the Windows Store service for software distribution, and a new variant known as Windows RT for use on devices that utilize the ARM architecture. An update to Windows 8, called Windows 8.1, was released on October 17, 2013, and includes features such as new live tile sizes, deeper OneDrive integration, and many other revisions. Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 has been subject to some criticism, such as removal of the Start menu.|$|E

40|$|In cloud {{computing}} {{it is assumed}} that a single <b>cloud</b> with increased <b>service</b> demands because of the limitations of the hardware and software resources, can encounter overload. Cloud Federation is an ideal solution to overcome these problems. There are different types of single and hybrid clouds in Cloud Federation. Also, one of the aspects of union activity is based on borrowing hardware and software resources and other {{cloud computing}} to reduce and stop the over load of host cloud. Therefore, measuring the quality of a single <b>cloud</b> <b>service</b> and hybrid <b>cloud</b> <b>service</b> in <b>cloud</b> federation carries much importance. To this end, the models based on the initial model were used to measure the Quality of Service.

2500|$|An {{important}} and ubiquitous function of DNS is its {{central role in}} distributed Internet services such as <b>cloud</b> <b>services</b> and [...] content delivery networks. When a user accesses a distributed Internet service using a URL, the domain name of the URL is translated to the IP address of a server that is proximal to the user. [...] The key functionality of DNS exploited here is that different users can simultaneously receive different translations for the same domain name, a key point of divergence from a traditional phone-book view of the DNS. This process of using the DNS to assign proximal servers to users is key to providing faster and more reliable responses on the Internet and is widely used by most major Internet services.|$|E
