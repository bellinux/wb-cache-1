25|$|A {{refrigeration}} system's {{coefficient of}} performance (CoP) {{is very important in}} determining a system's overall efficiency. It is defined as refrigeration <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> <b>kW</b> divided by the energy input in kW. While CoP is a very simple measure of performance, it is typically not used for industrial refrigeration in North America. Owners and manufacturers of these systems typically use performance factor (PF). A system's PF is defined as a system's energy input in horsepower divided by its refrigeration capacity in TR. Both CoP and PF can be applied to either the entire system or to system components. For example, an individual compressor can be rated by comparing the energy needed to run the compressor versus the expected refrigeration capacity based on inlet volume flow rate. It {{is important to note that}} both CoP and PF for a refrigeration system are only defined at specific operating conditions, including temperatures and thermal loads. Moving away from the specified operating conditions can dramatically change a system's performance.|$|E

40|$|Cryogenics is {{now widely}} present in large {{accelerator}} projects using applied superconductivity. Economical considerations permanently require {{an increase of}} the performance of superconducting devices. One way to do this consists to lower their operating temperature and to cool them with superfluid helium. For this purpose, large cryogenic systems at 1. 8 K producing refrigeration <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> the <b>kW</b> range have to be developed and implemented. These cryogenic systems require large pumping capacity at very low pressure based on integral cold compression or mixed cold-warm compression. This paper describes and compares the different cooling methods with saturated or pressurised superfluid helium, gives the present status of the available process machinery with their practical performance, and reviews the different thermodynamical cycles for producing refrigeration below 2 K, with emphasis on their operational compliance. ...|$|R
40|$|The 2009 Annual Economic Report (AER) of the EU {{fishing fleet}} {{is the most}} recent {{compilation}} of statistics on the economic performance of EU member states (MS) fishing fleets. The economic data used in this publication is collected {{within the framework of}} the Data Collection Regulation (DCR); cf. Council Regulation (EC) No 1543 / 2000 of 29 June 2000. This report presents a detailed economic and structural overview of each MS fishing fleet. Economic performance projections for a number of EU fleet segments of key importance are included, as is the latest information on EU fish prices and price trends. Results suggest that the total income generated by the EU fishing fleet was around 7, 650 million euros in 2007, a marginal increase compared with previous years. While the number of vessels decreased in most MS between 2002 and 2007, fleet <b>capacity,</b> measured <b>in</b> <b>kW</b> and GT, decreased at a much slower pace. Employment in EU fisheries has also decreased significantly - in 2007 there was around 140, 000 fishers employed in the EU fish catching sector. Fishing effort also decreased in most MS fleets. Most fish prices improved between 2002 and 2007, which helped keep landings values steady in the face of declining landings volumes. Overall, the EU fishing fleet was profitable in 2007. Profitability, cash-flow and value added improved between 2002 and 2006. The data suggests that there was a slight downturn in economic performance in 2007 compared with previous years, particularly in the old MS. The outlook for 2008 and 2009 suggests deterioration in economic performance. JRC. G. 4 -Maritime affair...|$|R

In November 2010, a dengue outbreak was reported in Monroe County in southern Florida (FL), including greater than 20 confirmed human cases.

RNA was extracted from the DENV- 1 isolate and was used in reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify PCR fragments to sequence. Nucleic acid primers were designed to generate overlapping PCR fragments that covered the entire genome. The DENV- 1 isolate found <b>in</b> Key West (<b>KW),</b> FL was sequenced for whole genome characterization.
