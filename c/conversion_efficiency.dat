5|$|The USMARC study {{indicated}} that Limousins were significantly the slowest of all breeds to achieve market end points of two measures of marbling score (70 to 160 days longer than the British breeds, and 65 to 70 days longer than the other continental European breeds) while feed <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency</b> based on live weight gain was marginally poorer (12% less than the British breeds and comparable with the other continental European breeds). When feed <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency</b> is adjusted to weight of saleable meat divided by feed consumed, Limousin feed <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency</b> then exceeds both British and continental European breeds by 10–25%. The USMARC study also indicated that Limousins were very significantly the slowest of all breeds to achieve market specifications of three measures of rib eye fat (300 to 400 days longer than the British breeds, and 170 to 220 days longer than the other continental European breeds) while feed <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency</b> based on live weight gain was poorer (25–30% less than the British breeds and 12–16% less than the other continental European breeds). When corrected to saleable meat divided by feed consumed, feed <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency</b> was similar or marginally better for Limousins. At these end points, Limousins finished at markedly heavier live weights (up to 490kg heavier than the British breeds, and 190kg heavier than the other continental European breeds).|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we report}} {{improved}} power <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of various carbon based quasi-solid state electrolytes/DSSCs by optimising {{the thickness of}} TiO 2 layer, incorporation of TiO 2 scattering layer and application of dense compact surface layers of TiO 2 on working electrodes. Single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) based quasi-solid state electrolytes showed increased power <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> from 1. 43 % to 3. 49 %. For the mixture of graphene and SWCNTs the power <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> improved from 2. 50 % to 2. 93 %. However, graphene based quasi-solid state electrolytes displayed small decreases in power <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> from 2. 10 % to 1. 96 % due to the more viscous nature of this electrolyte. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) demonstrated that the addition of these various carbon based nanomaterials into PMII significantly decreases the charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode and hence the much better performance obtained with carbon based quasi-solid state electrolytes compared to pure PMII based DSSCs...|$|R
5|$|Limousins {{have become}} popular {{because of their}} low birth weights (ease of calving), higher than average {{dressing}} percentage (ratio of carcase to live weight) and yield (ratio of meat to carcase), high feed <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency,</b> {{and their ability to}} produce lean, tender meat. A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and marginally faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because of their ability to contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and feed <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency</b> of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and marbled meat.|$|E
5|$|Crossbreeding {{increases}} {{production efficiency}} because of hybrid vigour, and allows complementary traits of {{parents to be}} combined to produce progeny better suited to different environments or markets. Crossbreeding {{through the use of}} Limousin terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds allows the complementary traits of higher marbling and fat cover provided by the British breed cows, and required or preferred by some markets, to be combined with the higher yield and feed <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency</b> of Limousin sires.|$|E

5|$|Gram {{quantities}} of various copper salts {{have been taken}} in suicide attempts and produced acute copper toxicity in humans, possibly due to redox cycling and the generation of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA. Corresponding amounts of copper salts (30mg/kg) are toxic in animals. A minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits {{has been reported to}} be at least 3 ppm in the diet. However, higher concentrations of copper (100 ppm, 200 ppm, or 500 ppm) in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence feed <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency,</b> growth rates, and carcass dressing percentages.|$|E

The food <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency</b> of house crickets (Acheta domesticus) is 1.7, some five times higher than that for beef cattle, and if their fecundity is taken into account, 15 to 20 times higher.|$|E
5|$|Limousins {{generally}} have {{lower levels of}} intra-muscular fat (marbling) and subcutaneous fat when compared with British breed cattle grown in similar conditions. Marbling, together with tenderness and flavour, {{has been associated with}} eating quality in some countries, and attracts a higher quality grading with associated premiums, although the link between marbling and palatability is not universally supported. In some countries, Limousin's lean, tender meat is considered to be of outstanding quality and marketed through specialist outlets. Beef producers targeting the higher marbling specifications of some markets, but who have concerns over the poorer feed <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency</b> and yield associated with higher marbling British breed cattle, use Limousin sires over British breed cows, or British breed sires over Limousin cows, in crossbreeding programmes that aim to achieve a balance between the different and conflicting production demands.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We numerically {{analyze the}} optical {{response}} and nonlinear susceptibilities of fishnet metamaterials with the holes infiltrated by a third-order nonlinear dielectric. Through full-wave simulations and employing a nonlinear parameter retrieval method, we confirm and quantify the enhanced nonlinearities, showing bulk third-order nonlinear susceptibilities that {{are up to}} two orders of magnitude larger than the nonlinear dielectric. We also use the retrieved parameters to calculate the material figure of merits and the <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> showing material figure of merits up to two orders of magnitude larger and <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> up to four orders of magnitude larger than the nonlinear dielectric alone. Though these results are calculated using one-unit-cell thick structures, the large magnitude of the enhancement still makes these structures attractive, allowing reasonable <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> supported by even subwavelength slabs. 1...|$|R

5|$|Octopus {{fisheries}} exist {{around the}} world with total catches varying between 245,320 and 322,999 metric tons from 1986 to 1995. The world catch peaked in 2007 at 380,000 tons, and fell by a tenth by 2012. Methods to capture octopuses include pots, traps, trawls, snares, drift fishing, spearing, hooking and hand collection. Octopus is eaten in many cultures and is a common food on the Mediterranean and Asian coasts. The arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways, often varying by species or geography. Live octopuses are eaten in several countries {{around the world}}, including the US. Animal welfare groups have objected to this practice on the basis that octopuses can experience pain. Octopuses have a food <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency</b> greater than that of chickens, making octopus aquaculture a possibility.|$|E
5|$|The best bulls go to {{artificial}} insemination (AI) cooperatives where semen is taken. AI allows the wide distribution of a bulls' genetics {{to the benefit}} of more farmers. However, in order to guarantee their genetic qualities, the bulls are subject to a strict selection scheme to increase the accuracy of the different genetic indexes. The best bulls identified at Lanaud are sent to another test station at Naves in Corrèze. Here they are tested more accurately and evaluated for feed <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency,</b> growth and muscle development. Progeny of the top 10 bulls out of this testing, and the best natural service bulls, are then evaluated.

5|$|Meat, {{mainly from}} farmed animals, {{is a major}} source of dietary protein around the world, {{averaging}} about 8% of man's energy intake. The actual types eaten depend on local preferences, availability, cost and other factors, with cattle, sheep, pigs and goats being the main species involved. Cattle generally produce a single offspring annually which takes more than a year to mature; sheep and goats often have twins and these are ready for slaughter in less than a year; pigs are more prolific, producing more than one litter of up to about 11 piglets each year. Horses, donkeys, deer, buffalo, llamas, alpacas, guanacos and vicunas are farmed for meat in various regions. Some desirable traits of animals raised for meat include fecundity, hardiness, fast growth rate, ease of management and high food <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency.</b> About half of the world's meat is produced from animals grazing on open ranges or on enclosed pastures, the other half being produced intensively in various factory-farming systems; these are mostly cows, pigs or poultry, and often reared indoors, typically at high densities.|$|E
