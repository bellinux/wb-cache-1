30|$|The trade {{model in}} Transtools 3 {{explains}} the transport flows by commodity type (NST/R 1) either between NUTS 3 zones or between countries. It was estimated partly on data {{at the country}} level and partly at the NUTS 3 level, and it is applied at the NUTS 3 level. The reason for partly estimating on country level is discussed in chapter 3. The model {{is based on the}} (unconstrained) gravity formulation, using characteristics of zones and the transport costs between zones. The dependent variables are PC flows between zones (measured in tonnes). The independent variables are GDP, GDP per capita (both obtained from the World Bank) and dummies for common trade zone (EU, EFTA), <b>common</b> <b>currency</b> <b>zone</b> (EURO), common language, zones being neighbours and zones being in the same country. The effect of transport cost is integrated in a Logsum variable (see Ben-Akiva and Lerman 1985 for an exposition of the Logsum as an accessibility measure) which is calculated from the Transtools 3 logistics model (see Jensen et al. A model for freight transport chain choice in Europe, submitted). It includes a range of different transport time components and transport costs components (for all modes considered).|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the main {{macroeconomic}} determinants of benefits and costs by undertaking processes of monetary integration and to investigate the possibility that currency unions could lead to the creation of a global currency in the future. In particular, we will consider two main determinants of costs and benefits predicted by the theory of Optimum Currency Areas: (i) the business-cycle correlation between the candidate’s economy and that of the <b>currency</b> <b>zone</b> as a whole, and (ii) the candidate economy’s inflation gain. Using this methodology, the results of the paper provide empirical evidence of the existence of several optimal currency areas in the world.

We find that the resulting optimal <b>common</b> <b>currency</b> is comprised of currencies with country weights that are statistically significant and fairly symmetrical with relatively equal weight (e. g., 22 % Argentinean pesos, 27 % Brazilian reals, 27 % Chilean pesos, and 23 % Uruguayan pesos).

A three-variable SVAR model is employed to identify three types of shocks, i. e. global, regional, and domestic shocks. The empirical results do not provide strong support for forming a <b>common</b> <b>currency</b> area in this region because the symmetric "prevalent shock" cannot be defined. However, {{it is found that}} since the late 1990 s the importance of asymmetric domestic shocks has declined while that of symmetric global and regional shocks has increased. Furthermore, East Asia is as symmetric as the Euro Area in terms of the correlation of global and regional shocks. The findings suggest that most East Asian economies have become symmetric in terms of economic shocks, and imply that a <b>common</b> <b>currency</b> area may become viable through deepening regional integration. <b>Common</b> <b>currency</b> area, Monetary integration, OCA, SVAR, East Asia...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the effect of the exchange rate arrangements on international tourism. The ambiguity of literature about the effect of exchange rate volatility contrasts with the magnitude of the impact of a <b>common</b> <b>currency</b> on trade. On the basis of a gravity equation we estimate a moderate effect of a currency union on tourism of almost 12 %. Furthermore, we estimate a gravity equation for international trade, obtaining that the <b>common</b> <b>currency</b> effect on trade is reduced when tourism is introduced as a regressor. This suggests that tourism flows may contribute to explain the excessive magnitude of the estimated effect of a <b>common</b> <b>currency</b> on trade in this literature. Finally, we analyze the impact of several de facto exchange rate arrangements on tourism, finding that less flexible exchange rates promotes tourism flows.

40|$|The {{prospect}} of imminent monetary unification in Europe has directed {{attention to the}} importance of the institutional setting that would be appropriate for efficient management of a <b>common</b> <b>currency.</b> The supporters of a ‘EuroFed’ often use a popular argument that stresses the superiority of a central bank as compared to a regime where sovereign countries can print a <b>common</b> <b>currency</b> [see e. g. Emerson (1992, p. 35) ]. It is said that in the latter case, there is an incentive for each country to ‘free-ride’ by ‘over-issuing’ the <b>common</b> <b>currency.</b> since while the cost of inflation is shared, the benefit of seigniorage accrues to the country that prints the money.
