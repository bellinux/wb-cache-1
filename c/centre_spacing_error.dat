40|$|A {{computer}} simulation {{was conducted to}} investigate the effectiveness of profile modification for reducing dynamic loads in gears with different tooth <b>spacing</b> <b>errors.</b> The simulation examined varying amplitudes of <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> and differences {{in the span of}} teeth over which the error occurs. The modification considered included both linear and parabolic tip relief. The analysis considered <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> that varies around most of the gear circumference (similar to a typical sinusoidal error pattern) as well as a shorter span of <b>spacing</b> <b>errors</b> that occurs on only a few teeth. The dynamic analysis was performed using a revised version of a NASA gear dynamics code, modified to add tooth <b>spacing</b> <b>errors</b> to the analysis. Results obtained from the investigation show that linear tip relief is more effective in reducing dynamic loads on gears with small <b>spacing</b> <b>errors</b> but parabolic tip relief becomes more effective as the amplitude of <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> increases. In addition, the parabolic modification is more effective for the more severe error case where the error is spread over a longer span of teeth. The findings of this study can be used to design robust tooth profile modification for improving dynamic performance of gear sets with different tooth <b>spacing</b> <b>errors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Coherent field imaging {{is based}} on the {{assumption}} of equal transmitting apertures spacing and equal spectrum of laser, and high-resolution image is reconstructed by iteratively computing the frequency spectrum. However, the inevitable transmitting aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> of laser is a key factor to affect the coherent field imaging quality in the application. Aiming at the problem of degrading imaging quality caused by the transmitting aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error,</b> we discuss the mechanism of influence of aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> on imaging quality and propose a novel method of improving imaging quality from the perspective of suppressing the influence of transmitting aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error.</b> Firstly, the mechanism of the influence of aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> on imaging quality and laser echo spectrum is analyzed in detail. Then we derive a frequency spectrum error propagation model. Based on the model, the iterative effect of frequency spectrum error is investigated and the trend of variation in imaging quality with frequency spectrum error is given. We propose a theoretical equation, in which the transmitting aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> has no influence on frequency spectrum nor imaging quality. To solve the above equation, an optimized method of linear programming is proposed and the optimized matrix of aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> is obtained. In practice, the influence of aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> on imaging quality can be largely counteracted by reasonably allocating aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> according to the optimized <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> matrix. The correctness and validity of the theoretical model are verified by a simulation experiment. The results show that the Strehl ratio of imaging quality index can be improved by about 100 % through using the proposed method, the greater the aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error,</b> the higher the Strehl ratio of imaging quality index obtained by the method will be. In addition, the method is easy to use practically and less costly as well. Finally, it is concluded that the proposed method can easily and effectively counteract the degrading effect of aperture <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> on imaging quality. The research can provide a theoretical basis for improving imaging quality and reasonably assigning transmitter aperture spacing accuracy of coherent field imaging telescope...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: In the {{panoramic}} images, palatoglossal <b>space</b> <b>error</b> develops {{when the}} patient is unable to put the tongue against the mouth roof. In {{the case of this}} error, the radiographic diagnosis of the area is made with some difficulties or ever the image may lose its diagnostic ability. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the relationship between the palatoglossal <b>space</b> <b>error</b> of the panoramic images and skeletal relationship.   Materials and Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional trial, 494 panoramic images were selected at the orthodontic department of Tehran dental school archive and the existence of the palatoglossal space was determined. The palatoglossal <b>space</b> <b>error</b> was statistically analyzed using chi-square test regarding the patients’ gender, age and skeletal relationships.   Results: Of total panoramic images, 346 (70. 0 %) cases showed palatoglossal <b>space</b> <b>error</b> while 148 (30. 0 %) images were free from this error. Furthermore, 74. 1 % of male images and 66. 9 % of female images showed palatoglossal <b>space</b> <b>error.</b> In Cl I (1 ˂ANB≤ 3), Cl II and Cl III patients; 65. 6 %, 73. 1 % and 67. 4 % of the images demonstrated the error, respectively.

40|$|Electrode <b>spacing</b> <b>errors</b> and errors {{correlated}} with {{the magnitude of the}} observed potential are two key factors that affect the data quality for DC resistivity imaging measurements. This paper investigates the properties and effects of these two kinds of error on 2 D resistivity imaging or inversion for practical applications. By analytic analysis and numerical simula-tions, the off-line and in-line electrode <b>spacing</b> <b>errors</b> were quantitatively estimated for all common electrode arrays (pole-pole, pole-dipole, pole-bipole, Wenner, Schlumberger, dipole-dipole, γ-array,Wenner-β) in 2 D resistivity imaging surveys. Meanwhile, the spreading patterns of the <b>spacing</b> <b>errors</b> in the pseudosection and the possible artefacts in the imaging (inverted model) are evaluated. We show that the magnitude of the <b>spacing</b> <b>errors</b> are quite different with these arrays, being largest for dipole-dipole, Wenner-β and γ-array surveys, for which a 10 % in-line <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> may cause twice as large an error (> 20 %) in the observed resistance or apparent resistivity, which in turn will produce some artefacts in the inverted model. The observed potential errors obtained with the reciprocity principle and collected from different sites and with different electrode arrays, were analysed to show the proper...|$|R

40|$|Most NLP {{applications}} {{work under}} the assumption that a user input is error-free; thus, word segmentation (WS) for written languages that use word boundary markers (WBMs), such as spaces, has been regarded as a trivial issue. However, noisy real-world texts, such as blogs, e-mails, and SMS, may contain <b>spacing</b> <b>errors</b> that require correction before further processing may take place. For the Korean language, many researchers have adopted a traditional WS approach, which eliminates all spaces in the user input and re-inserts proper word boundaries. Unfortunately, such an approach often exacerbates the word spacing quality for user input, which has few or no spacing errors; such is the case, because a perfect WS model does not exist. In this paper, we propose a novel WS method that takes into consideration the initial word spacing information of the user input. Our method generates a better output than the original user input, even if the user input has few <b>spacing</b> <b>errors.</b> Moreover, the proposed method significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art Korean WS model when the user input initially contains less than 10 % <b>spacing</b> <b>errors,</b> and performs comparably for cases containing more <b>spacing</b> <b>errors.</b> We believe that the proposed method will be a very practical pre-processing module. ...|$|R

We examine the symmetric bidirectional control architecture, where the control action on a vehicle depends equally on the <b>spacing</b> <b>errors</b> with respect to its adjacent vehicles. Performance of this decentralized scheme in terms of <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> amplification and disturbance propagation is investigated. The results established in this paper show that a symmetric bidirectional architecture with a linear controller suffers from fundamental limitations on closed loop performance that cannot be mitigated by appropriate control design.

40|$|This study {{analysed}} {{the performance}} of constant time based airborne spacing under different operational conditions using fast time simulation. The effects of time based spacing criteria, mixed aircraft types and wind conditions {{on the ability of}} an aircraft to maintain a time spacing behind a descending lead aircraft were investigated. The spacing performance of a previously used approximate time delay spacing criterion based on current lead aircraft speed was compared with an exact time delay spacing criterion based on lead aircraft position history. The exact time delay spacing criterion resulted in smaller time delay <b>spacing</b> <b>errors</b> and smoother true airspeed behaviour. The exact time delay (60 s) criterion was then used to compare the spacing performance of a heavy aircraft following a light with a heavy aircraft following a heavy for different wind conditions. The results show that a heavy aircraft followed a light with approximately 40 % more maximum time <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> than a heavy aircraft followed a heavy. Different effects for constant and turbulent winds were observed. Maximum <b>spacing</b> <b>error</b> increased slightly with constant wind speed but always remained within 10 s up to maximum constant wind speeds of 87 knots (at 30 feet altitude) and 235 knots (at 29, 000 feet altitude).
