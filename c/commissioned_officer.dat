5|$|Today, ranks {{equivalent}} to midshipman exist in many countries. Using U.S. midshipman or pre-fleet board UK midshipman {{as the basis}} for comparison, the equivalent rank would be a naval cadet in training to become a junior <b>commissioned</b> <b>officer.</b> Using post-fleet board UK midshipman for comparison, the rank would be the most junior <b>commissioned</b> <b>officer</b> in the rank structure, and similar to a U.S. ensign in role and responsibility.|$|E

50|$|The Indian Army has {{a unique}} set of ranks, which stand between non-commissioned <b>officers</b> and <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers.</b> During the British Raj, they were known as Viceroy's <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers,</b> but since the Indian {{independence}} movement, they have been called junior <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers.</b>|$|R

50|$|In the United States Military, warrant {{officers}} and chief warrant officers are addressed as Mister by senior <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers.</b> In the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard it is proper to use Mister {{to refer to}} <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers</b> below the rank of lieutenant commander, or to subordinate <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers,</b> though the use of Mister implies familiarity {{compared to the use}} of rank title for an unknown officer.|$|R
5|$|Whether <b>commissioned</b> <b>officer,</b> mercenary, or both, Standish {{apparently}} came to Holland around 1603 and, {{according to}} historian Tudor Jenks, {{may have seen}} service during the siege of Sluis in 1604, in which Vere's English troops were involved. The subsequent Twelve Years' Truce (1609–1621) between Spain and the Dutch Republic might have ended Standish's service.|$|E

5|$|Beaty {{continued}} to distinguish {{himself in the}} 5th Regiment's further engagements. His actions during the Battle of Fair Oaks & Darbytown Road in October 1864 earned him a mention in the general orders to the Army of the Potomac. The regimental commander, Colonel Giles Shurtleff, twice recommended him for a promotion to <b>commissioned</b> <b>officer.</b> Nothing came of Colonel Shurtleff's requests, however Beaty did receive a brevet promotion to lieutenant. By {{the time he was}} mustered out of the Army he had participated in thirteen battles and numerous skirmishes.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, {{changes in}} the {{training}} of naval officers in both the Royal Navy and the United States Navy led to the replacement of apprenticeship aboard ships with formal schooling in a naval college. Midshipman began to mean an officer cadet at a naval college. Trainees now spent around four years in a college and two years at sea prior to promotion to <b>commissioned</b> <b>officer</b> rank. Between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries, time at sea declined to {{less than a year}} as the entry age was increased from 12 to 18.|$|E
5000|$|In the U.S. Navy, both <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers</b> and Chief Petty Officers {{are often}} colloquially {{referred}} to as [...] "khakis". In the past, <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers</b> and chief petty officers wore khaki-colored uniforms while onboard seagoing vessels, in direct contrast to petty officers and seamen, who were {{referred to as}} deckplate sailors, or blueshirts. However, since 2009, while khakis are still worn ashore, the U.S. Navy has begun using a blue and gray camouflage working uniform which replaced the khaki-colored ones worn by <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers</b> and chief petty officers on board ships, and also adopted a new service uniform for petty officers and seamen in pay grades E-6 and below, consisting of a khaki shirt and black trousers. The latter has caused some discontent among some chief petty <b>officers</b> and <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers</b> as a result. In the U.S. Coast Guard, petty officers, chief petty officers, warrant <b>officers,</b> and <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers</b> all wear similar uniforms.|$|R
50|$|A King's <b>{{commission}}ed</b> Indian <b>officer</b> (KCIO) was an Indian {{officer of}} the British Indian Army who held a full King's commission after training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in England, {{as opposed to the}} Indian <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers</b> (ICOs), who were trained at the Indian Military Academy at Dehra Dun, and the Viceroy's <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers</b> (VCOs), who were treated in almost all respects as <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers,</b> but who only had authority over Indian troops. KCIOs were introduced in the early 20th century under the Indianisation process. They were equivalent in every way to the British officers holding a King's commission (known in India as King's <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers,</b> or KCOs). They held the same ranks, and unlike VCOs had authority over British troops. In fact, most KCIOs served on attachment to a British unit {{for a year or two}} early in their careers.|$|R
50|$|The medal may {{be awarded}} to <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers,</b> junior <b>commissioned</b> <b>officers,</b> other ranks, and Non-Combatants (enrolled) {{of the regular}} Army.

5|$|Leslie Andrew {{was born}} on 23 March 1897 in Ashhurst in the Manawatu region of New Zealand, {{the son of a}} local school headmaster. He grew up in Wanganui, where his father had moved his family having taken up a {{position}} in the area, and was educated at Wanganui Collegiate School. After leaving school he was employed by the New Zealand Railways Department as a clerk. He participated in the cadet program while at school, and later joined the Territorial Force. By 1915, he had been promoted to sergeant and had sat the necessary exams to become a <b>commissioned</b> <b>officer</b> in the Territorials.|$|E
5|$|Zinta {{was born}} in a family from Rohru in Shimla district, Himachal Pradesh. Her father, Durganand Zinta, was an officer in the Indian Army. He died in a car {{accident}} when she was 13years old; the accident also involved her mother, Nilprabha, who was severely injured and consequently remained bedridden for two years. Zinta called the tragic accident and her father's death a significant turning point in her life, which forced her to mature rapidly. She has two brothers; Deepankar and Manish, a year older and a year younger respectively. Deepankar is a <b>commissioned</b> <b>officer</b> in the Indian Army, while Manish lives in California.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} a relief company, from the 1st Battalion of the Kumaon Regiment, reached Badgam, the {{position}} held by Sharma's company had been overrun. However, the 200 casualties suffered by the tribal infiltrators caused them to lose the impetus to advance. This bought time for Indian forces to fly into Srinagar airfield and block all routes of ingress to Srinagar itself. During the battle, along with Sharma, one junior <b>commissioned</b> <b>officer</b> and 20 other ranks of D company were killed. Sharma's body was recovered three days later. Though it was disfigured beyond recognition, his body was identified {{by means of the}} leather holster of his pistol and a few pages of Bhagavad Gita in his breast pocket.|$|E

5|$|Forrest Mims was {{interested}} in science and electronics as a youth and even built an analog computer while in high school. Mims graduated from Texas A University in 1966 (major in government with minors in English and history) then became a <b>commissioned</b> <b>officer</b> in the U.S. Air Force. While serving in Vietnam as an intelligence officer, Mims continued his model rocket hobby. At Texas A, Mims developed an infrared obstacle-sensing device and he experimented with it at the Saigon School for Blind Boys and Girls. Launching model rockets in an area accustomed to rocket attacks and working with blind children resulted in {{a story in the}} military newspaper, Stars and Stripes. This caught the attention of an Air Force Colonel, who arranged for Mims to be assigned to the Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland AFB even though Mims lacked an engineering degree.|$|E
5|$|Henry Edward Roberts studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Miami before enlisting in the U.S. Air Force in 1962. He {{soon became}} an {{electronics}} {{instructor at the}} Cryptographic Equipment Maintenance School at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. To augment his meager enlisted man's pay, Roberts worked on several off-duty projects and even set up a one-man company, Reliance Engineering. The most notable job was to create the electronics that animated the Christmas characters in the window display of Joske's department store in San Antonio. In 1965, he was selected for an Air Force program to complete his college degree, and became a <b>commissioned</b> <b>officer.</b> Roberts earned an Electrical Engineering degree from Oklahoma State University in 1968 and {{was assigned to the}} Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Congress's call for soldiers at {{the outbreak of}} the American Revolutionary War in the spring of 1775, Williams joined a Continental Army rifle unit as a <b>commissioned</b> <b>officer.</b> Soon thereafter, he and his unit marched off to the Siege of Boston. Seeing his first significant combat action in late 1776 at the Battle of Fort Washington, Williams was captured by the British and imprisoned in New York. He was released in early 1778 and returned to the Continental Army as colonel of the 6th Maryland Regiment, a position he had acquired during his captivity. From thereafter, Williams led his regiment through much of the southern campaign, most notably in the battles of Camden, Guilford Court House, and Eutaw Springs. Near the end of the War, Williams was sent by his commanding officer General Greene with documents to Congress and was promoted to brigadier general in 1782.|$|E

5|$|Best's mother, Mona Best (born Alice Mona Shaw), {{was born}} in Delhi, India, and was the {{daughter}} of Thomas (an Irish major) and Mary Shaw. Randolph Peter Scanland (later surnamed Best), her first child, {{was born in}} Madras (now Chennai), Madras Presidency, British India, on 24 November 1941. Best's biological father was marine engineer Donald Peter Scanland, who subsequently died during World War II. Best's mother was training to become a doctor {{in the service of the}} Red Cross when she met Johnny Best, who came from a family of sports promoters in Liverpool who ran Liverpool Stadium. During World War II, Johnny Best was a <b>commissioned</b> <b>officer</b> serving as a Physical Training Instructor in India, and was the Army's middleweight boxing champion. After their marriage on 7 March 1944 at St Thomas's Cathedral, Bombay, Rory Best was born. In 1945, the Best family sailed for four weeks to Liverpool on the Georgic, the last troop ship to leave India, carrying single and married soldiers who had previously been a part of General Sir William Slim's forces in south-east Asia. The ship docked in Liverpool on 25 December 1945.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, a {{midshipman}} was {{a rating}} for an experienced seaman, {{and the word}} derives from the area aboard a ship, amidships, either where the original rating worked on the ship, or where he was berthed. Beginning in the 18th century, a <b>commissioned</b> <b>officer</b> candidate was rated as a midshipman, and the seaman rating began to slowly die out. By the Napoleonic era (1793–1815), a midshipman was an apprentice officer who had previously served {{at least three years}} as a volunteer, officer's servant or able seaman, and was roughly equivalent to a present-day petty officer in rank and responsibilities. After serving at least three years as a midshipman or master's mate, he was eligible to take the examination for lieutenant. Promotion to lieutenant was not automatic, and many midshipmen took positions as master's mates for an increase in pay and responsibility aboard ship. Midshipmen in the United States Navy were trained and served similarly to midshipman in the Royal Navy, although unlike their counterparts in the Royal Navy, a midshipman was a warrant officer rank until 1912.|$|E
