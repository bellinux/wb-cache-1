50|$|The {{cancelled}} prototype {{model of}} the AK-12 is very different to its predecessors ergonomically. It features a telescoping buttstock that is in-line with the barrel for better recoil control and a stock latch, allowing {{for it to be}} folded to either side of the rifle. It has a rubber height-adjustable cheek piece and butt plate. The cocking handle is moved forward and can be attached to both sides for ambidextrous use. The receiver is hinged and more rigid with a Picatinny rail for mounting optics. There are several other accessory rails on the weapon, including on both sides, on the bottom and {{on the top of the}} handguard (in-line with the receiver for a longer monolithic rail), and on top of the gas block. There is also a lug under the gas chamber that can mount a GP-34 grenade launcher and another one under the front sight holder mounts a bayonet. The rear iron sight is further back on the receiver and can be set for aiming when the stock is extended or folded. The magazine release is in the same position but can be used by the trigger finger to detach magazines. In a departure from previous AK-type rifles, the dust <b>cover</b> <b>safety</b> selector has been replaced with an ambidextrous fire selector; it has four positions for safe, semi-automatic, three-round burst fire and fully automatic fire. Other improvements include a smaller ejection port, more ergonomic pistol grip, improved rifling and a muzzle brake with a 22 mm threading that can fire NATO standard rifle grenades.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Vehicular multi-hop ad hoc {{networks}} (VANETs) {{enable the}} exchange of information between vehicles without any fixed infrastructure. The application range of such networks may <b>cover</b> <b>safety</b> related applications like the warning of drivers about accidents or congestions as well as Internet access e. g. via gateways along the road. The varying conditions in VANETs introduce high requirements on the routing protocols being used. Thus, we developed a realistic freeway mobility model and evaluated the performance of AODV, DSR, FSR and TORA in typical freeway traffic scenarios on the basis network simulations. The results show that AODV performs best {{in most of the}} simulated traffic situations, followed by FSR and DSR, while TORA is inapplicable for VANETs. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Safety is an {{important}} consideration in humanrobot interactions (HRI). Robots can perform powerful movements that can cause hazards to humans surrounding them. To prevent accidents, {{it is important to}} identify sources of potential harm, to determine which of the persons in the robot’s vicinity may be in greatest peril and to assess the type of injuries the robot may cause to this person. This survey starts with a review of the safety issues in industrial settings, where robots manipulate dangerous tools and move with extreme rapidity and force. We then move to covering issues related to the growing numbers of autonomous mobile robots that operate in crowded (human-inhabited) environments. We discuss the potential benefits of fully autonomous cars on safety on roads and for pedestrians. Lastly, we <b>cover</b> <b>safety</b> issues related to assistive robots. I...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOwing to {{pervasive}} computing and advanced technology, assistive devices are deployed within smart environments {{to provide services}} dedicated to elderly and disabled users. Beside the big help and usefulness provided by such environments for elderly and disabled users, {{there is still a}} high demand to make them both safe and secure. The aim of this chapter is to first give an overview of security requirements for smart environments which have been recently studied to better show the lack of security services for elderly and disabled users. These requirements must be fulfilled for elderly or disabled people among the various smart environments considered (homes, offices, schools, workplaces, hospitals and cars). Considering this challenging task, the aim of our contribution will try to <b>cover</b> <b>safety,</b> security, privacy and trust issues, in order to derive some guidelines for future research work dedicated to both elderly and disabled peopl...|$|E

40|$|Transcranial {{magnetic}} stimulation (TMS) is {{an established}} neurophysiological tool {{to examine the}} integrity of the fast-conducting corticomotor pathways {{in a wide range of}} diseases associated with motor dysfunction. This includes but is not limited to patients with multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, movement disorders, disorders affecting the spinal cord, facial and other cranial nerves. These guidelines cover practical aspects of TMS in a clinical setting. We first discuss the technical and physiological aspects of TMS that are relevant for the diagnostic use of TMS. We then lay out the general principles that apply to a standardized clinical examination of the fast-conducting corticomotor pathways with single-pulse TMS. This is followed by a detailed description of how to examine corticomotor conduction to the hand, leg, trunk and facial muscles in patients.

40|$|Field studies over a {{range of}} scales have been {{important}} in the upstream {{oil and gas industry}} for decades. Advances in digital outcrop characterization and data capture, coupled with increased computational capabilities, have resulted in a resurgence in fieldwork; these field studies are required to develop depositional, stratigraphic and structural concepts and provide the data which underpin the current generation of complex, computer generated, 3 D subsurface models. These models provide an informed means of benchmarking the subsurface along with a more considered view of subsurface uncertainty and management of the risks identified. The papers in this volume <b>cover</b> <b>safety</b> in the field, frontier basin petroleum system assessment, field appraisal and development including unconventional resources, applications of techniques such as LiDAR and 3 D photogrammetry, and uncertainty characterization.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{work performed}} at Rockwell International's Space Systems Division {{to investigate the}} feasibility of, and develop concepts for, automated and/or robotic resupply of consumables on orbit. The work focuses on the resupply of satellites and is described in five sections. First, the various problems relating the resupply on orbit are discussed: for example, economic concerns, fuel handling problems, and safety issues. Next major methods of effecting fuel transfer on orbit are summarized, together with their advantages and disadvantages. Direct fuel exchange is emphasized as the most feasible technique. Third, guidelines are developed for automated/robotic refueling mechanisms to accomplish on-orbit consumable resupply. For example, the guidelines <b>cover</b> <b>safety,</b> reliability, maintainability, alignment, induced loads, thermal protection, leaks, extravehicular activity (EVA) interface, and so on. The fourth part of the paper covers the development of design concepts for satellite resupply robotic interfaces that comply with the guidelines. Concepts include servicer fluid transfer system and satellite propulsion system, and a combined docking/umbilical device. Last, future technical development in these areas are discussed...|$|E

40|$|In 1995 the {{streamlined}} British {{national curriculum}} defined outdoor education as "outdoor and adventurous activities " (OAA) {{and placed it}} within the physical education (PE) curriculum. However, many PE teachers lack a knowledge of outdoor education and, when faced with limitations in time, resources, facilities, and expertise, may choose alternative options in the national curriculum. This paper shows how PE staff in secondary schools can deliver an OAA program in an urban environment. A program is outlined for a typical secondary school campus in Bedford (England). The activities described could be undertaken in the classroom, gym, "hard area, " campus and playing fields, city parks and outlying commons, and the nearby river. With regard to staffing, the PE department must decide whether to use existing staff expertise, train staff to the standard required, or hire an external specialist to <b>cover</b> <b>safety</b> and organizational aspects. The great advantages of an urban-based OAA program are accessibility combined with low costs and the imaginative use of everyday settings and equipment. Constructing programs around such an environment develops lateral thinking and imagination in both students and staff. Seasonal limitations are {{less of a problem}} than in wilderness areas, thus allowing for educational progression, continuity of teaching, and cross curricular links. (Contains 23 references.)
