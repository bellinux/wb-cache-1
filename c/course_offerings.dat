25|$|The {{consolidation}} {{plans to}} save money because the town will no longer have two high school budgets. Academically, the plan is seen as high priority {{in order to improve}} the town's educational system on the secondary level. Because the current high school curriculum split between two high schools, a curriculum of a consolidated high school will allow for more expanded vocational studies, flexible scheduling, and a competitive curriculum with diverse <b>course</b> <b>offerings.</b> Talks of consolidation have been ongoing since May 2010, a referendum passed in 2012, and construction began in 2014. Enfield High School and Fermi High School merged in 2016 school year.|$|E
25|$|In September 1966, Southern Miss {{extended}} its offerings {{by adding the}} Jackson County Resident Center, located on the Jackson County campus of the MGCCC in Gautier. The Jackson County Center was built for the university by the Jackson County Board of Supervisors. This effort was encouraged by Dr. Shelby Thames when he was {{executive vice president of}} USM. The center was constructed with the intention of enabling students in Jackson County to complete four-year degrees in several fields through combined programs at MGCCC and USM. In 2009, however, the university decided to close its Jackson County Center and consolidate <b>course</b> <b>offerings</b> at other teaching sites on the Gulf Coast.|$|E
25|$|Durham {{has been}} criticised for not {{accepting}} as many students from low participation neighbourhoods, and from state schools, {{as might be}} expected from its admission standards and <b>course</b> <b>offerings.</b> For admissions in 2015/16, Durham had the third lowest percentage of state school students (among higher education institutions with over 1,000 full-time first-degree entrants) at 60.5%, compared to a Higher Education Statistics Agency benchmark of 75%. According to pro-vice-chancellor, Alan Hudson, this was a temporary drop from the 63% level the university has reached in recent years, and to which it is expected to return in 2016/17. The university also fell short of its benchmark for admissions from low participation neighbourhoods, accepting 5.1%, compared to a benchmark of 6%.|$|E

25|$|Another {{aspect of}} Oberlin's {{academics}} is the Winter Term {{during the month}} of January. This term was created to allow students to do something outside the regular <b>course</b> <b>offerings</b> of the college. Students may work alone or in groups, either on or off campus, and may design their own project or pick from a list of projects and internships set up by the college each year. Students must complete a winter term project three years out of their four in the College of Arts and Sciences. Projects range from serious academic research with co-authorship in scientific journals, to humanitarian projects, to making avant-garde films about historic Chicago neighborhoods, to learning how to bartend. A full-credit project is suggested to involve five to six hours per weekday.|$|E
25|$|During Colorado Agricultural College's {{first term}} in fall 1879, the school functioned {{more as a}} college-prep school than a college {{because of the lack}} of trained students. Consequently, the first <b>course</b> <b>offerings</b> were arithmetic, English, U.S. history, natural philosophy, {{horticulture}} and farm economy. Students also labored on the college farm and attended daily chapel services. The spring term provided the first true college-level instruction. Despite his accomplishments, Edwards resigned in spring 1882 because of conflicts with the State Board of Agriculture, a young faculty member, and with students. The board's next appointee as president was Charles Ingersoll, a graduate and former faculty member at Michigan Agricultural College, who began his nine years of service at CAC with just two full-time faculty members and 67 students, 24 of whom were women.|$|E
25|$|Thirty years later, the 1960s {{ushered in}} a {{turbulent}} period for St. Paul's. In 1968, students wrote an acerbic manifesto describing the school administration as an oppressive regime. As {{a result of this}} manifesto, seated meals were reduced from three times a day to four times a week, courses were shortened to be terms (rather than years) long, Chapel was reduced to four times a week, and the school's grading system was changed to eliminate + and- grades and given its current High Honors, Honors, High Pass, Pass, and Unsatisfactory labels instead of A–F. By the end of the sixties, St. Paul's had begun to admit sizable numbers of minorities in every class, had secularized its previously strict religious schedule considerably, expanded its <b>course</b> <b>offerings,</b> and was poised to begin coeducation. It admitted girls {{for the first time in}} 1971.|$|E

25|$|The College of Commerce {{was founded}} in the liberal arts tradition, drawing on faculty from other {{disciplines}} on campus. Carl C. Plehn was appointed the first dean of the new college in 1898. Plehn, a finance professor educated in Germany, drafted the college's first curriculum for a Bachelor of Science degree. The initial <b>course</b> <b>offerings</b> covered legal studies, political studies, political economy, and historical studies, including The History of the Institution of Private Property, History and Principles of Commercial Ethics, and the History of Commerce in All Countries and at Every Age. Plehn proposed changes to the curriculum in 1915 {{to give it a}} more professional focus. The proposal, adopted after World War I, established a program that included two years of liberal arts education followed by junior and senior year commerce study, a pattern still used for the undergraduate program today.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{desegregation}} {{under the}} plan is via transfer of black students to the county {{rather than in the}} suburbs-to-city component of the plan: although the plan called for 2,500 white students to enroll in city magnet schools, by the late 1980s, only 600 had done so, and in 2010, only 167 suburban students were enrolled in city schools. In contrast, roughly 6,000 city students are transferred to suburban schools as of 2010 (down from a peak of more than 14,000 in 1999–2000). Other failures included the portion of the plan that was {{to improve the quality of}} St. Louis city schools via capital improvement programs; despite considerable funding, the curriculum, <b>course</b> <b>offerings,</b> libraries, and art and music programs in city schools remained weaker than county schools. Among the criticisms of the desegregation program also has been that it weakens city schools by removing talented students to county schools. Despite these issues, the program will continue until all transfer students reach graduation; with the last group of transfer students allowed to enroll in 2013–2014, the program will end after the 2025–2026 school year.|$|E
