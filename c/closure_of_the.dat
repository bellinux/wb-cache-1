50|$|As a corollary, {{it follows}} that any homeomorphism between simple closed {{polygonal}} curves extends to a homeomorphism between their interiors. For each polygon there is a homeomorphism of a given triangle onto <b>the</b> <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> their interior. <b>The</b> three homeomorphisms yield a single homeomorphism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangle. By the Alexander trick this homeomorphism can be extended to a homeomorphism <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangle. Reversing this process this homeomorphism yields a homeomorphism between <b>the</b> <b>closures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interiors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polygonal curves.|$|R
