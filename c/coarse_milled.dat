40|$|Cassava chips (7 % {{moisture}} level) {{produced from}} cassava root (IITA 94 / 0561) was stored for 6 months in {{high density polyethylene}} bag. Stored chips were <b>coarse</b> <b>milled,</b> rehydrated to 62. 51 % and seeded with fresh cassava mash (FCM) at levels of 5 %, 10 % and 20 %. The resulting mash was fermented for 72 hr, with pH monitored every 24 hr, and processed to gari. Yield and swelling capacity of gari were determined. Sensory evaluation was carried out on water soaked gari and gari paste (‘eba’). While least values for pH was obtained in FCM throughout the fermentation period, there was reduction in values in all samples with increase in fermentation time from 30. 01 to 33. 40 %. Yield of gari from the seeded chips ranged from 64. 4 - 72. 3 %, while that of FCM was 18. 7 %. Swelling capacity of gari ranged from 2. 0 - 3. 0 in FCM and that seeded with 20 % FCM, respectively. Sensory evaluation result revealed that gari produced from cassava chips seeded at 10 % level is adequate for making ‘eba ’ while that seeded at 5 % level is adequate for consumption as soaked gari (p< 0. 05). Use of stored cassava chips with 10 % FCM for gari production could be encouraged to reduce postharvest problem of cassava roots and the drudgery of gari processing...|$|E

The milling force prediction model for milling of composite using the end milling cutter is built by orthogonal experiment.

Experimental treatments were <b>coarse</b> <b>milled</b> barley, barley treated with 3. 5 % NaOH, barley treated with 0. 4 % formaldehyde and barley treated with 3. 5 % urea that all chemical treated barley milled coarse before feeding. NaOH Treatment reduced concentrations of Lysine and Cystine in the barley grain. All chemical treatments decreased rumen disappearances of barley CP but only NaOH and Formaldehyde treatments also decrease total AA and some of the AA disappearances in the rumen. All chemical treatments increased DM, OM, CP, starch, NDF, ADF and hemicellulose disappearance of barley in the PAT. But only NaOH and Formaldehyde treatments increased total AA and most of AA disappearances in the PAT. Effect of chemical treatments on increase of disappearance of starch, Met and Gly in the total tract was significant (p< 0. 05). Rumen disappearance of TAA was lower than CP but PAT disappearance of TAA was more than CP and finally total tract disappearance of TAA was more than CP.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Grain Science and IndustrySajid AlaviThe {{feasibility}} {{of using a}} wheat flour mill to refine corn, sorghum and cowpea was studied. Milling of white sorghum grain resulted in decrease in fiber content from 1. 89 % to 0. 38 % and 0. 45 % in raw, finely milled and coarsely milled sorghum respectively. Similarly, there was a reduction in fat (3. 17 % to 1. 75 % and 0. 51 %) content from raw to fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>milled</b> fractions. Starch content increased from 61. 85 % in raw to 69. 80 % in fine and 72. 30 % in coarse fractions. Protein content was almost unchanged at about 7. 40 % in all the fractions. In de-hulling and milling of cowpeas, starch and protein content increased whereas fiber, fat and ash content decreased. There {{was a significant difference}} in expansion characteristics between whole and decorticated binary blends on account of different levels of inherent starch content. Sorghum cowpea (SC) blends had the highest specific mechanical energy (SME) range (285. 74 – 361. 52 kJ/kg), followed by corn soy (CS) (138. 73 – 370. 99 kJ/kg) and the least SME was found in sorghum soy (SS) blends (66. 56 – 332. 93 kJ/kg). SME was found to be positively correlated to starch content in the blends. SC blends had the most stable process followed by SSB and CSB in that order. The milling of expanded extrudates was found to be dependent on bulk density and low bulk density extrudates had bigger particle size and vice-versa. The water absorption index (WAI) for SC was 4. 17 g/g to 5. 97 g/g, SS ranged from 2. 85 g/g to 5. 91 g/g and CS ranged from 2. 63 g/g to 5. 40 g/g. Starch gelatinization ranged from 85. 42 – 98. 83 % for SC, 90. 70 – 96. 27 % for SS, and 72. 57 – 95. 49 % for CS. The starch digestibility increased after extrusion and cooking but there was no significant change in protein digestibility. There was a significant reduction in anti-nutritional factors – phytic acid (26. 06 – 44. 03 %), tannins (18. 69 – 26. 67 %) and trypsin inhibitor (16. 55 – 50. 85 %) after extrusion. Thus, the study showed that high protein blends with superior nutrition density needed for preparation of FBFs could be produced by using existing/traditional milling capabilities and extrusion process...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} heat {{treatment}} of bran {{on the true}} zinc absorption was measured using an isotope-dilution technique. A bran-based breakfast cereal (heated to 204 degrees for 40 min during manufacture) was incorporated into a semi-synthetic diet {{at a level of}} 180 g/kg. A parallel diet was formulated containing an identical weight of untreated bran from the same source plus other ingredients used to make the cereal. 2. Young male Wistar rats (mean weight 80 g) were injected intramuscularly with 65 Zn to label body Zn. They were given the heat-treated- and untreated-bran diets for 9 d. During the last 6 d of this period Zn intakes and faecal and urinary Zn were measured in order to calculate apparent Zn retention. True Zn retention was measured by taking into account losses of Zn of endogenous origin (labelled with 65 Zn), by measuring faecal and urinary radioactivity of endogenous origin. 3. Heat treatment of bran removed approximately one-third of the phytate, but this was not enough to improve Zn absorption from the diet. True Zn retention measured by isotope dilution was significantly higher (P less than 0. 02) than apparent Zn retention measured by the conventional balance technique. 4. The hypothesis that a reduction in particle size of bran would improve mineral availability was tested by feeding coarse and milled bran (100 mg/kg diet) in a semi-synthetic diet to rats and measuring true Fe and apparent Zn absorptions. The importance of phytate was also investigated by feeding a diet containing dephytinized bran. 5. Male Wistar rats (mean weight 172 g) were given diets containing <b>coarse,</b> <b>milled</b> or dephytinized bran for 9 d. Fe and Zn intakes were measured and faeces and urine collected for Fe and Zn analysis. 6. Rhe mean (+/- SE) particle size of the bran was reduced on milling from 3. 5 (+/- 1. 8) to 0. 2 - 0. 5 mm. There were no differences in the fraction of Fe retained between the three groups. Particle size had a small effect on Zn retention which was marginally higher in rats on the milled-bran diet (0. 126 (+/- 0. 023)) than in those on the coarse-bran diet (0. 087 (+/- 0. 012)). Total removal of phytate had a greater effect and apparent Zn retention from the dephytinized-bran diet was significantly higher (0. 182 (+/- 0. 027), P less than 0. 001) ...|$|E

Although a fine milling improves substrate accessibility and conversion rate (up to 30 % compared to <b>coarse</b> <b>milling),</b> it also {{increases the risk}} of media acidification because of rapid and high acids production during fermentation of the substrate soluble fraction.

40|$|Lupine protein {{concentrate}} is a promising ingredient {{that can be}} obtained by a combination of milling and air classification, generally called dry fractionation. This is a more sustainable route than conventional wet extraction and delivers a {{protein concentrate}} with native functional properties. Critical is the detachment of the protein bodies from other seed components during milling. Ideally, the protein bodies are released during milling, whereas the other components remain in larger particles (D 0. 5 > 40 µm) to facilitate effective air classification. <b>Coarse</b> <b>milling</b> (down to 100 µm) followed by air classification gave concentrates with protein contents between 54 and 59 g protein/ 100 g dry solids and yields up to 13 %. The application of flowability aids (fused silica particles) during air classification doubled the yield of the protein-rich fraction. The air classified protein concentrate could provide a 2. 3 times extended half-life of the foam compared to an intensively heated protein concentrate. In addition, the viscosity of the native concentrate was lower, while after (in vitro) digestion the amount of proteins smaller than 3 kDa was higher in native and mildly heated concentrates compared to intensively heated concentrate. These results suggest promising development of liquid-like formulations from air classified lupine protein concentrates...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of microbial protein in the rumen {{has a major}} impact on protein- and amino acid supply in ruminants. The amount and amino acid composition of the protein that enters the small intestine primarily depends on diet formulation. In the present studies the effects of maize silage (MS) and grass silage (GS) on ruminal fermentation and microbial protein synthesis were investigated, considering methodical aspects of in vitro studies, particularly grinding of feed samples. In the first experimental series five mixed diets with different proportions of MS and GS (100 : 0, 79 : 21, 52 : 48, 24 : 76 and 0 : 100) and a constant proportion of soybean meal (11 %) were used. The content of crude protein (CP) and fibre fractions increased, whereas the content of organic matter (OM) and starch decreased with increasing proportion of GS in the diet. It was hypothesised that a combination of MS and GS can benefit microbial growth and thus fermentation of nutrient fractions to a higher extent than using only one forage source separately. It was also to be investigated how changes in diet composition affect the amino acid profile of microbial protein. A well standardised semi-continuous rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC) was used, which is a commonly accepted experimental model in investigations on ruminal fermentation. Changes in fermentation characteristics, as a result of changing the MS-to-GS ratio, were tested for linear and quadratic effects in order to identify possible associative effects. Prior to the in vitro incubation, feedstuffs were dried and ground. It was aimed to investigate in which way fermentation in the RUSITEC system is influenced by mean feed particle size. Therefore two milling screen sizes (MSS; 1 vs. 4 mm) were used in all diets and results on fermentation characteristic were tested for possible interactions of forage source and MSS. One incubation period lasted for 13 days (6 days adaption period, 7 days sampling period), and each treatment was tested in at least three replicates. Ruminal digesta, obtained from rumen-fistulated wether sheep, was used as the inoculum for starting the incubation. Diets were fed once daily to the RUSITEC system, and nylon feed bags remained for 48 h inside the fermentation vessel. A buffer solution, containing 15 NH 4 Cl, was infused continuously into the vessel and the respective effluent was analysed for short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and NH 3 -N. Solid- and liquid- associated microbial fractions were isolated from the feed residues, the liquid inside the vessel and the effluent by differential centrifugation. The flow of microbial CP was quantified on the basis of N and 15 N balances. The feed residues were analysed for crude nutrients and detergent fibre fractions and the respective degradation rates were calculated. OS and CP in the feed residues were corrected for the contribution of solid-associated microbes. The degradation of OM and fibre fractions, as well as amounts of NH 3 -N increased linearly with stepwise replacement of MS by GS. Degradation of CP was unaffected by diet composition, as well as total SCFA production. The degradation of OM and CP was higher in <b>coarse</b> <b>milled</b> (4 mm-MSS) than in fine milled (1 mm-MSS) treatments, accompanied by higher amounts of NH 3 -N and total SCFA. An improvement of growth conditions for some microbial groups, e. g. anaerobe fungi, was discussed. The amount of microbial CP increased linearly by the stepwise replacement of MS by GS, and was higher at 4 mm-MSS than at 1 mm-MSS. The amount of available N was assumed to advance microbial growth in the RUSITEC system. Efficiency of microbial CP synthesis was improved from 29 to 43 mg microbial N per g degraded OM by increasing the proportion of GS in the diet, but was unaffected by MSS. The N content and the profiles of amino acids of the three microbial fractions, as well as the ratio of solid- to liquid-associated microbes were affected by diet composition and MSS. Interactions of forage source and MSS were rare. However, the results indicated interactions between dietary factors and origin of microbial isolate on characteristics of microbial protein synthesis. In order to provide additional information on the nutritional value, the mixed diets were evaluated by two further methods. The total tract digestibility of crude nutrients was determined in wether sheep. The content of metabolisable energy was similar between diets and averaged 11. 5 MJ per kg dry matter. The in vitro gas production was measured within 93 h by using a modified Hohenheim gas production test, providing information on kinetics and extent of ruminal fermentation. Cumulative gas production decreased with increasing proportion of GS in the diet. A negative effect of coarse milling on fermentation in the Hohenheim gas production test was confirmed. Across all diets gas production was delayed at 4 mm-MSS compared to 1 mm-MSS. The results from both approaches supported the findings of the RUSITEC study that a stepwise replacement of MS by GS led to a linear response in degradation of nutrients. As indicated by the gas production data, positive associative effects might only occur in the first hours after starting an incubation. When mixed diets are used effects cannot be clearly related to individual diet ingredients. Moreover, in the mixed diets interactions between soybean meal inclusion and forage source or feed particle size cannot be excluded. Therefore pure silages were incubated separately in the RUSITEC system in the second experimental series and three milling screens of different size were used (1, 4 and 9 mm). In accordance with the first experimental series, degradation of OM, fibre fractions and non-structural carbohydrates, production of NH 3 -N, as well as microbial CP flow and efficiency of microbial CP synthesis were higher in GS than in MS. A higher degradation of CP was found for MS than for GS, indicating interactions between forage source and soybean meal inclusion. An increase in MSS from 1 mm to 9 mm led to an improvement in the degradation of OM, CP and non-structural carbohydrates, particularly of starch in MS, {{as well as in the}} microbial CP flow for both silages. But the efficiency of microbial CP synthesis and microbial amino acid profile were less affected by MSS. In the second experimental series additionally the effect of available N on fermentation of MS was investigated. The supplementation of urea-N improved the degradation of non-structural carbohydrates, especially starch, but not that of fibre fractions in MS. The efficiency of microbial CP synthesis was increased from 26 to 35 mg microbial N per g degraded OM by urea-N supplementation to MS. The way of urea administration, either supplied together with the feed once daily or infused continuously by buffer solution, had only marginal effects on fermentation characteristics. It was concluded that microbial growth is improved by degradation of OM from GS compared to MS and by an increasing availability of N in the RUSITEC system. Meaningful associative effects of mixtures of MS and GS on ruminal fermentation characteristics are not likely to occur. However, transferability of results to other batches of MS and GS is limited, as high variations in chemical composition are known for both types of silage. Fermentation of MS- and GS-based diets in the RUSITEC system benefits more by coarse milling at MSS up to 9 mm than by fine milling at 1 mm-MSS. Consequently, variations in MSS and feed particle size distribution have to be taken into account when evaluating feeds by rumen simulation systems. The changes in composition and contribution of microbial fractions give indications to a shift in the microbial community as a result of variation of silage type and feed particle size, but further research on this aspect is needed. Moreover, the present results stated that the origin of the microbial samples is very important for measurements on microbial protein synthesis. Die Synthese mikrobiellen Proteins im Pansen hat einen entscheidenden Einfluss auf die Protein- und Aminosäurenversorgung der Wiederkäuer. Die Menge und die Aminosäuren-zusammensetzung des am Dünndarm anflutenden Proteins sind vor allem von der Rations-gestaltung abhängig. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde der Einfluss von Maissilage (MS) und Grassilage (GS) auf die ruminale Fermentation und die mikrobielle Proteinsynthese untersucht. Die Betrachtung methodischer Aspekte, insbesondere der Vermahlungsgrad des Futters, wurde in den vorliegenden in vitro Untersuchungen einbezogen. In der ersten Versuchsreihe (Paper I + II) wurden fünf Mischrationen mit unterschiedlichen Anteilen an MS und GS (100 : 0, 79 : 21, 52 : 48, 24 : 76 und 0 : 100) und einem konstanten Anteil an Sojaextraktionsschrot (11 %) verwendet. Mit steigendem Anteil an GS in der Ration stieg der Gehalt an Rohprotein (XP) und Faserfraktionen an, wohingegen der Gehalt an organischer Substanz (OS) und Stärke abnahm. Es wurde die Hypothese aufgestellt, dass eine Kombination von MS und GS das mikrobielle Wachstum und somit den Nährstoffabbau in einem höheren Maße begünstigt als die Verwendung einer einzigen Grundfutterquelle. Zudem sollte geprüft werden, wie sich die Rationsänderung auf das Aminosäurenmuster des mikrobiellen Proteins auswirkt. Es wurde eine gut standardisierte semi-kontinuierliche Pansensimulationstechnik (RUSITEC) genutzt, welche als Modell für Untersuchungen zur Pansenfermentation weitestgehend akzeptiert ist. Die Veränderung der erfassten Fermentationsparameter, als Folge der Änderung des MS:GS-Verhältnisses in der Ration, wurde auf lineare und quadratische Effekte untersucht, um mögliche assoziative Effekte zu identifizieren. Vor der in vitro Inkubation der Futtermittel wurden diese getrocknet und vermahlen. Inwieweit die mittlere Futterpartikelgröße die Ergebnisse im RUSITEC-System beeinflusst, sollte durch eine Variation der Siebweite (SW; 1 vs. 4 mm) bei der Vermahlung geklärt werden. Mögliche Wechselwirkungen von Grundfutterquelle und SW auf die Kenngrößen der ruminalen Fermentation wurden geprüft. Eine Inkubationsperiode dauerte 13 Tage (6 Tage Adaptationsphase, 7 Tage Sammelphase) und jede Behandlung wurde mit mindestens 3 Wiederholungen getestet. Als Startmedium für die Inkubation diente feste und flüssige Phase der ruminalen Digesta von pansen-fistulierten Hammeln. Das Futter wurde dem RUSITEC-System einmal täglich zugeführt und die Nylonfutterbeutel verblieben 48 h im Fermentationsgefäß. Eine mit 15 NH 4 Cl versetzte Pufferlösung wurde kontinuierlich in das System infundiert. In der jeweiligen Überlaufflüssigkeit wurde der Gehalt an kurzkettigen Fettsäuren (SCFA) und NH 3 -N bestimmt. Drei Mikrobenfraktionen wurden aus der festen und flüssigen Phase des Systems mittels Differentialzentrifugation isoliert; und zwar aus den Futterresten, aus der Flüssigkeit im Inneren des Fermentationsgefäßes und aus der Überlaufflüssigkeit. Die Menge an mikrobiellem XP, welches das System täglich verließ wurde mittels N- und 15 N-Bilanzen bestimmt. Die Futterreste wurden auf ihren Gehalt an Rohnährstoffen und Detergenzien-Faser-Fraktionen analysiert. Der Gehalt an OS und XP in den Futterresten wurde um den jeweiligen Anteil der Partikel-assoziierten Mikroben korrigiert. Der stufenweise Austausch von MS durch GS bewirkte einen linearen Anstieg im Abbau der OS und der Faserfraktionen, sowie in der Menge an NH 3 -N. Der XP-Abbau und die Gesamt-menge an gebildeten SCFA waren durch die Ration nicht beeinflusst. Eine grobe Vermahlung (4 mm SW) führte im Vergleich zu einer feinen Vermahlung (1 mm SW) zu einer Erhöhung im OS- und XP-Abbau, sowie zu einer erhöhten SCFA-Produktion. Eine Verbesserung der Wachstumsbedingungen für bestimmte Mikrobengruppen, z. B. anaerobe Pilze, wurde diskutiert. Die Menge an mikrobiellem XP stieg linear mit dem Austausch von MS durch GS an und war bei 4 mm-SW höher als bei 1 mm-SW. Es wurde vermutet, dass die Menge an verfügbarem N im RUSITEC-System das mikrobielle Wachstum fördert. Die Effizienz der mikrobiellen XP-Synthese (mg mikrobieller N/g abgebaute OS) stieg mit zunehmendem Anteil an GS in der Ration von 29 auf 43 an, war aber nicht durch die SW beeinflusst. Der N-Gehalt und das Aminosäurenprofil der drei Mikrobenfraktionen, ebenso wie das quantitative Verhältnis von Mikroben der festen und flüssigen Phase zueinander, waren durch die Rationsgestaltung und die SW beeinflusst. Wechselwirkungen von Grund-futterquelle und SW auf die untersuchten Merkmale waren kaum zu beobachten. Allerdings deuteten sich Wechselwirkungen zwischen den beiden Faktoren und der Herkunft der Mikrobenfraktion auf die Parameter der mikrobiellen Proteinsynthese an. Um zusätzliche Informationen zum Futterwert zu erhalten, wurden zwei weitere Methoden zur Evaluierung der Mischrationen herangezogen. Eine Bestimmung der Rohnährstoff-verdaulichkeit bei Hammeln ergab, dass der Gehalt an umsetzbarer Energie zwischen den Rationen ähnlich war und im Mittel 11. 5 MJ je kg Trockensubstanz betrug. Zudem wurde in vitro die Gasbildung über 93 h mittels eines modifizierten Hohenheimer Futterwert-Testes gemessen, um Aussagen zur Kinetik und zum Umfang der ruminalen Fermentation zu erhalten. Die kumulative Gasbildung nahm mit steigendem Anteil an GS in der Ration ab. Der negative Einfluss einer gröberen Vermahlung im Hohenheimer Futterwert-Test konnte bestätigt werden. In allen Rationen war die Gasbildung durch eine Erhöhung der SW von 1 mm auf 4 mm vermindert. Die Ergebnisse aus diesen beiden Untersuchungsansätzen untermauerten die Aussage der RUSITEC-Studie, dass ein stufenweiser Austausch von MS durch GS in der Ration zu einer linearen Änderung im Nährstoffabbau führt. Die Ergebnisse zur Gasbildung deuteten darauf hin, dass positive assoziative Effekte nur in den ersten Stunden nach Beginn der Inkubation auftreten. Bei der Verwendung von Mischrationen können Effekte nicht eindeutig einzelnen Futter-komponenten zugeordnet werden. Zudem kann bei den Mischrationen nicht ausgeschlossen werden, dass Wechselwirkungen zwischen dem zugesetzten Sojaextraktionsschrot und der Grundfutterquelle oder der Futterpartikelgröße auftreten. Deshalb wurden in der zweiten Versuchsreihe ausschließlich die beiden Silagen getrennt inkubiert und drei verschiedene SW während der Vermahlung genutzt (1, 4, 9 mm). In Übereinstimmung mit den Ergebnissen der ersten Versuchsreihe war der Abbau der OS, der Faserfraktionen und der Nichtstruktur-Kohlenhydrate, die Menge an NH 3 -N sowie der mikrobielle XP-Fluss und die Effizienz der mikrobiellen XP-Synthese bei GS höher als bei MS. Ein höherer XP-Abbau konnte bei MS im Vergleich zu GS festgestellt werden, was Hinweis auf eine Wechsel-wirkung zwischen Grundfutterquelle und der Zulage von Sojaextraktionsschrot gibt. Ein Anstieg in der Siebweite von 1 auf 9 mm führte in beiden Silagen zu einer Verbesserung im Abbau der OS, des XP und der Nichtstruktur-Kohlenhydrate, inbesondere von Stärke in MS, sowie zu einem erhöhten mikrobiellen XP-Fluss. Die Effizienz der mikrobiellen XP-Synthese, sowie das Aminosäurenmuster waren kaum von der SW beeinflusst. In der zweiten Versuchsreihe wurde zusätzlich der Effekt der N-Verfügbarkeit auf die Fermentation von MS untersucht. Die Zugabe von Harnstoff-N führte zu einer Verbesserung im Abbau der Nichtstruktur-Kohlenhydrate, insbesondere der Stärke. Der Abbau der Faser-fraktionen blieb hingegen unbeeinflusst. Die Effizienz der mikrobiellen XP-Synthese erhöhte sich von 26 auf 35 mg mikrobieller N/g abgebaute OS infolge der Harnstoffzugabe. Die Art und Weise der Harnstoffsupplementierung, entweder einmal täglich zusammen mit dem Futter oder als kontinuierliche Infusion über die Pufferlösung, hatte nur marginale Auswirkungen auf die untersuchten Fermentationsparameter. Es wurde geschlussfolgert, dass das mikrobielle Wachstum im RUSITEC-System durch den Abbau der OS aus GS im Vergleich zu MS, sowie durch eine Erhöhung der verfügbaren N-Menge begünstigt wird. Nennenswerte assoziative Effekte auf das Fermentationsgeschehen durch die Kombination von MS und GS in Mischrationen sind nicht zu erwarten. Allerdings ist die Übertragbarkeit dieser Ergebnisse auf andere Silage-Chargen begrenzt, da große Unterschiede in der chemischen Zusammensetzung bestehen können, sowohl bei MS als auch bei GS. Die Fermentation von MS und GS wird durch eine gröbere Vermahlung mit Erhöhung der SW von 1 mm bis auf 9 mm positiv beeinflusst. Infolgedessen sollten Unterschiede in der SW und der Futterpartikelgrößenverteilung bei der Bewertung von Silagen im RUSITEC-System berücksichtigt werden. Die Veränderungen in der Zusammen-setzung und der Mengenanteile der einzelnen Mikrobenfraktionen, als Folge der Variation der Grundfutterquelle und der Futterpartikelgröße, weisen auf eine Verschiebung in der Zusammensetzung der mikrobiellen Gemeinschaft hin. Zudem bestätigen die vorliegenden Ergebnisse, dass die Herkunft der Mikrobenmasse einen großen Einfluss auf die Bewertung der mikrobiellen Proteinsynthese hat...|$|E

The fine fraction, with higher amount of starch and low amount of crude protein, lipids and dietary fiber content when compared to oat <b>coarse</b> <b>milling</b> products was conditioned to moisture levels (15. 5 - 25. 5 %) and extruded in a simple one-screw Brabender laboratory extruder (C/D = 20 : 1). The conditions of extrusion were compression ratio 3 : 1, screw speed of 100 rpm, a die of 6 mm in diameter and temperatures between 77. 6 and 162. 4 °C in the 2 nd and 3 rd zones while the 1 st zone was maintained at 80 °C. The extruded material was dried, ground, conditioned in plastic bag and periodically determined the peroxide value and n-hexanal. The unsaturated fatty acids content of the oil fraction was higher (79. 20 %). Independent of moisture level, all extruded products in temperatures less than 120 °C showed low oxidative rancidity...|$|R
40|$|Fine milling in {{combination}} with thinbed mash filters has been introduced into the brewing industry more than 20 years ago. Although clearest worts can be obtained at highest gravity, {{in combination}} with high extract yield and improved starch conversion, a majority of brewers still use the conventional <b>coarse</b> <b>milling</b> {{in combination with}} lautertuns. Brewers seem still afraid having a negative impact of fine milling on wort and beer quality {{especially with regard to}} over extraction of polyphenols, proteins and oxidative enzymes. A lack of detailed data comparing both wort production methods could be a reason. In this study, the faster wort filtration as well as higher extract yield has been confirmed when using fine milling and a thin bed filter. A higher concentration of fermentable sugar led to this increased yield and not an increased level of proteins and polyphenols. On the contrary, fine milling in combination with thicker mash and thin bed filtration results in a lower level of haze sensitive protein in the pitching wort in comparison to coarse grist and the use of a lautertun. No striking differences have been found comparing analyses of fresh beer. Also during forced ageing of the beers at 30 [*]°C, no difference in the formation of flavour negative compounds or degradation of bitterness has been noticed. Both wort production methods result in highly comparable beers with equal flavour stability. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|With {{increasing}} use {{of biomass}} in pulverized fuel coal fired power stations, the impact of mill type on biomass size and shape is fundamental in optimizing mill and burner performance. The impact of mill type on the energy consumption, particle size and particle shape of four different biomasses commonly combusted in pulverized fuel boilers was investigated in this paper. Miscanthus, mixed wood, and steam exploded pellets, along with powdered olive cake, were comminuted in a planetary ball mill, Bond ball mill and cutting mill. For pelletized miscanthus, milling showed little impact on the particle {{size and shape of}} the pellets, with the milling action only reducing the pellets back to their original particle size distribution. This was also observed for the steam exploded pellets and mixed wood pellets in the cutting mill. For non-densified biomasses, such as olive cake, fines below the screen size should be removed before milling in a hammer mill as they pass straight through the mill, resulting in wasted mill capacity and energy consumption. Pellets should be composed of particles close to the required size for conveyance and combustions, and sphericity and roundness are crucial in determining this size. Olive cake showed the most spherical and round particles, but a <b>coarser</b> <b>milled</b> product size than the steam exploded pellets. Miscanthus and mixed wood pellets showed needle like shape profiles, as well as similar particle size distributions.

40|$|Lupine {{seeds are}} {{excellent}} source of plant protein. We here report on dry fractionation by combining milling and electrostatic separation providing {{an alternative to}} wet extraction of protein from lupine seeds. Relatively <b>coarse</b> <b>milling</b> was preferred as this provides sufficient detached protein bodies with less agglomeration of particles. After a single separation step a fraction with protein content 57. 3 g/ 100 g dry solids was obtained. After three successive steps protein content was increased further to 65. 0 g/ 100 g dry solids. By extra milling and recycling the fractions with comparable protein content as the flour, yield was improved without compromising protein content. A final fraction with protein content 65. 1 g/ 100 g dry solids and yield of 6 % was obtained, which means 10 % of protein in the flour was recovered. Based on our findings an optimised scheme for protein enrichment from lupine seeds by combining milling and electrostatic separation is proposed. Industrial relevance Lupine seeds are {{an excellent source of}} plant protein. Wet extraction of protein from lupine seeds consumes large amounts of water and energy. Alternatively, dry fractionation is more sustainable and retains the native functional properties of the protein. Previously, it was shown that dry milling and electrostatic separation could be used to further enrich protein from lupine flour. In this study, the process was further investigated with a new custom-build bench scale electrostatic separator. We found that a lupine protein concentrate could be obtained with higher purity compared to conventional air classification and earlier lab-scale experiments. Subsequently, a scheme was developed to improve the yield of the lupine protein concentrate without compromising the purity, and this provides a guideline for scaling-up this technique for industrial application. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{global demand}} for protein-rich foods is {{expected}} to double {{in the coming decades}} due to the increasing prosperity and world population. To keep up with the demand, the transition from an animal to a plant-based protein supply is desirable from long-term economic and environmental perspectives. In particular, legumes such as pea and lupine are of interest due to their nutritional profile and high protein content. Legume proteins are commonly purified by wet fractionation, which consumes large amount of water and energy and alters the native functionality of the proteins. Therefore, this thesis describes a sustainable, dry fractionation method for legumes to obtain functional protein-enriched fractions. Firstly, experiments have been performed to increase understanding of both the material properties of legume seeds and of the process conditions relevant to dry fractionation. Dedicated milling settings were selected for starch-rich and oil-rich legumes based on legume morphology. Milling settings were estimated based on starch granule size in starch-rich legumes, while <b>coarse</b> <b>milling</b> provided better results for oil-rich legumes. Separation of the protein bodies from other cellular components was established by air classification, which consumed ten times less energy and 50 litre water per kg protein less compared to conventional wet fractionation. Secondly, the functionality of the fractions was analysed. The dry-enriched protein fractions provided higher solubility than conventionally produced fractions, making them suitable for high protein drinks. Moreover, pea fractions could also be gelatinized which opens opportunities for preparing solid protein foods such as meat replacers. In conclusion, this thesis contributes to the awareness that the food industry could exploit a more sustainable dry fractionation technique to obtain functional protein fractions rather than focussing on wet extraction of relative pure protein ingredients...|$|R

40|$|As ore {{deposits}} become finer grained {{the requirements}} for regrinding before cleaning or leaching have increased substantially. Despite this increasing need, there is no standard test to predict grinding energy requirement below 70 microns. The standard Bond Mill test applies for <b>coarser</b> ball <b>milling,</b> but is not appropriate tor stirred milling with fine media grinding to 70 microns. With no industry - standard test, the energy requirement is often {{made on the basis}} of supplier estimates or benchmarking against similar applications. Yet suppliers use vastly different scale-up methods which result in widely different energy estimates. Estimates can differ by 100 - 300 % even for similar mills. This must result in serious errors to install either too much or too little grinding power. This paper explores this by comparing the actual performance of full scale regrind mills against their original design estimate. It confirms that serious scale-up errors have been made, and have then been perpetuated by "benchmarking". The test conditions to achieve accurate power estimation are discussed. The essential test conditions are: continuous (not batch) tests, ensure steady state (no coarse fraction retained in test mill), correctly account for classification, measure energy directly (not inferred), and using the same media size as the full scale installation. Failure to correctly address even one of these factors can bias results by 40 %; failure to address several multiplies the error...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2000 In {{a typical}} gold-recovery plant, it is {{estimated}} that a substantial amount of the gold in residues may be in the form that is recoverable by cyanidation. The gold in residues can be ascribed broadly to (l) the presence of cyanicides, which consume the cyanide radical and thus inhibit dissolution of gold, (2) refractory gold resulting from coatings on some gold particles, (3) large gold particles incompletely dissolved due to inadequate contact time, (4) unliberated gold as a result of too <b>coarse</b> a <b>milled</b> product, and (5) gold dissolved during leaching, then adsorbed by other minerals or by carbonaceous matter in the pulp. This study focuses on the latter, where dissolved gold is pregrobbed during leaching by adsorbent materials in the ore. The term pregrobbing refers to the active adsorption ofgold from cyanide pregnant solutions by components ofthe ore. It has been suggested that gold already dissolved by cyanide may be adsorbed by other minerals and by carbonaceous matter in the pulp. The presence ofcarbonaceous matter in gold ores presents a two-fold problem namely, the poor release of gold from the carbonaceous matrix and the uptake of dissolved gold by the carbonaceous leach residues. Studies by several other investigators using ores from various parts of the world have similarly shown that the natural carbonaceous matter associated with refractory gold ores often behaves like activated carbon when in contact with aurocyanide solutions. Some debate also exists over the extent to which gold may be adsorbed onto the surfaces of minerals. Different authors have identified that minerals such as' pyrite, copper sulphides, quartz and layered silicates, such as kaolin, phlogopite and ilIite exhibit gold adsorbing properties.

5000|$|The {{history of}} milling cutters is intimately {{bound up with}} that of milling machines. Milling evolved from rotary filing, {{so there is a}} {{continuum}} of development between the earliest milling cutters known, such as that of Jacques de Vaucanson from about the 1760s or 1770s, through the cutters of the milling pioneers of the 1810s through 1850s (Whitney, North, Johnson, Nasmyth, and others), to the cutters developed by Joseph R. Brown of Brown & Sharpe in the 1860s, which were regarded as a break from the past for their large step forward in tooth coarseness and for the geometry that could take successive sharpenings without losing the clearance (rake, side rake, and so on). De Vries (1910) reported, [...] "This revolution in the science of milling cutters took place in the States about the year 1870, and became generally known in Europe during the Exhibition in Vienna in 1873. However strange it may seem now that this type of cutter has been universally adopted and its undeniable superiority to the old European type is no longer doubted, it was regarded very distrustfully and European experts were very reserved in expressing their judgment. Even we ourselves can remember that after the coarse pitched cutter had been introduced, certain very clever and otherwise shrewd experts and engineers regarded the new cutting tool with many a shake of the head. When, however, the Worlds Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876, exhibited to European experts a universal and many-sided application of the <b>coarse</b> pitched <b>milling</b> cutter which exceeded even the most sanguine expectations, the most far-seeing engineers were then convinced of the immense advantages which the application of the new type opened up for the metalworking industry, and from that time onwards the American type advanced, slowly at first, but later on with rapid strides".|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research project is to study the impact of an innovative wort production method on flavour quality and flavour stability of lager beer. The innovation comprises 1) thick and fast mashing under anti-oxidative conditions to save time and energy; 2) high mashing-off temperature (95 &# 176;C) compared to conventional mashing-off temperature of 78 &# 176;C; 3) acidified sparging; and 4) in-line wort stripping with culinary steam and in-kettle stripping during filling of the kettle (till kettle is full) for continuously stripping of unwanted volatiles. After wort filtration and in-line stripping, no additional boiling is required. Special {{attention was paid to}} mashing-in conditions (O 2, pH, temperature), in order to prevent early oxidation. During transfer of the mash to the mash vessel, the malt aldehydes are to be stripped off as much as possible. Clean steam injectors in combination with over-sized chimneys and condensate traps and high mashing-off temperatures should facilitate the release and stripping of unwanted volatile aldehydes. Mashing-off at temperatures above 95 &# 176;C has three aims: 1. strip off unwanted volatile aldehydes; 2. partially degrade of SMM to DMS (flavour of Brussels sprouts); 3. coagulate and flocculate high molecular weight proteins. The holding time of the elevated mashing-off temperature will depend on these three items. The fastest and thickest mashing conditions were first evaluated to produce concentrated mashes in the shortest time frame. A thick mash results in smaller total volumes so that low water and reduced energy input is required during mashing. An efficient sparging will then lead to lowest volumes for boiling with highest extract content which is again beneficial in view of energy consumption and brewhouse capacity. Fine milling in combination with thinbed wort filtration resulted in highly comparable wort, beer, and ageing profiles compared to conventional coarse milling/lautertun operations. High mashing-off temperature resulted in a fast wort filtration, bright sweet wort and a low heat load (based on the TB-Index). Due to the high mashing-off and wort filtration temperature, SMM is already transformed into free DMS which evaporates partially at mashing-off. Sufficient conversion of SMM and removal of DMS is possible by in-line and in-kettle clean steam injection during filling of the combination vessel. Sparging with acidified water at high temperature minimised the extraction of extra proanthocyanidins during the sparging step ending up with comparable amounts compared to conventional wort production. High mashing-off temperature also resulted in decreased levels of haze sensitive proteins, in comparison with conventional mashing-off temperature. The use of steam to form and strip DMS however results in the formation of a low trub content, but the small protein flocks are difficult to remove. No striking differences have been found when comparing conventionally produced beers with the innovative beers. However, important differences have been observed when the beers were subjected to ageing. Due to the acidified sparging, high aldehyde contents have been found in the pitching wort upon innovative wort production. The low pH of sparging liquor seems to result in an enhanced release of imine-bound aldehydes. As apparent from analysis of pitching wort, these free aldehydes have not been efficiently stripped off (in contrast to DMS), but after fermentation, comparable levels of free aldehydes were found in the fresh beers. However, during ageing of the innovative beer, lower levels of aldehydes were found resulting in significantly lower overall ageing sensory scores. The release of aldehydes during acidified sparging, even at conventional sparge temperatures of 78 &# 176;C, is also malt dependent. In conclusion, the innovative wort production, executed in less than 3. 5 hours, results in a highly comparable fresh beer, but with an extended flavour stability compared to conventional beer production. Concentrated mashes and highest extract content due to low sparge rates will result in a decreased need of energy for wort production. The high throughput of the two vessel brewhouse with a thinbed filter will also reduce the investment cost.

Eight Landrace x Large White fattening barrows were fed 3 high fibre (HF) diets (on average 17. 8 % NDF on DM) and a traditional (C) diet (13. 5 % NDF) in a Latin Square design. Feeding was restricted. Each of the 4 periods included 21 days adaptation and 7 days digestibility/calorimetry. The HF diets included wheat bran (<b>coarse</b> or <b>milled)</b> or beet pulp.

40|$|Marama bean (Tylosema esculentum (Burch) A. Schreib) is an underutilised, drought-tolerant legume {{native to}} the drier parts of Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. The bean is {{comparable}} to soya beans in protein content and quality whereas its oil content is {{comparable to that of}} peanuts. By adding value to the marama bean through processing into protein-rich flours, its utilisation may be increased. Therefore, one of the objectives {{of this study was to}} adopt suitable low-cost processing technologies used for soya processing to produce protein-rich marama bean flours. The effect of dry heating of whole marama beans on lipoxygenase enzymes of its defatted flour was determined since oxidative rancidity catalysed mainly by lipoxygenase enzymes can reduce the shelf-life of the flour. The presence of trypsin inhibitors can affect the protein digestibility of the marama bean flour adversely. The effect of dry heating of whole marama beans on in-vitro protein digestibility and amino acid content of its defatted flour was determined. Lastly, the effect of dry heating of whole marama beans on the protein-related functional properties of the resultant defatted flour was determined. The presence of lipoxygenase iso-enzymes (L- 1 and L- 2) activity in marama beans was determined by a visual and spectrophotometeric method using unheated soya beans as reference. Lipoxygenase iso-enzymes (L- 1 and L- 2) activity was not detected in marama beans. This may possibly suggest that these lipoxygenase iso-enzymes are absent or possibly inhibited in marama beans. In an attempt to optimise dry heating to inactivate trypsin inhibitors in marama beans, whole marama beans were dry heated at 100 °C, 120 °C and 150 °C, respectively for 20 min. Defatted flours prepared from the heated marama beans (HMF’s) were analysed for their trypsin inhibitor activity using defatted flours from unheated marama beans (UMF) and soya beans (USF) as control and reference samples, respectively. Trypsin inhibitor activity in UMF was almost four and half times higher than in USF. Dry heating of whole marama beans at 150 °C/ 20 min significantly reduced the trypsin inhibitor activity in its defatted flour to almost zero probably due to inactivation of the trypsin inhibitor. The effect of dry heating of whole marama beans at 150 °C/ 20 min on the physico-chemical, nutritional and protein-related functional properties of defatted marama bean flour was determined. UMF was used as a control while USF and HSF were used as reference samples. HMF had higher protein content but lower fat content than UMF. It is suggested that dry heating disrupted the lipid bodies of the marama beans allowing more oil to be expelled during <b>coarse</b> <b>milling</b> of the flour. Heating significantly reduced the L* values of marama and soya bean flours possibly due to Maillard browning reactions. Heating significantly increased in-vitro protein digestibility of marama and soya bean flours probably due to protein denaturation and inactivation of trypsin inhibitors. Heating generally decreased the amino acid contents of marama and soya bean flours possibly due to chemical modification of the amino acids. UMF and HMF can potentially be used to improve protein quality in marama-cereal composite flours, porridges and breads. Heating significantly decreased the nitrogen solubility index (NSI) and emulsifying capacity (EC) of marama and soya bean flours possibly due to protein denaturation and/or cross-linking. This may make HMF and HSF not suitable for applications in emulsion type meat products such as sausages because emulsion formation is critical during processing of sausages. Heating significantly decreased the foaming capacity of soya flour but did not have an effect on that of marama bean flour probably due to their high residual fat content which may have disrupted protein films during foam formation. UMF has a potential to be used in comminuted meat products because of its relatively high NSI, EC and OAC. The laboratory process used in this study can be modified and adopted by SME’s to produce defatted marama bean flours with potential applications in bakery and meat products and as a protein supplement in composite marama-cereal products.

As I walked in the woods to see the birds and squirrels, so I walked in the village to see the men and boys; instead of the wind among the pines I heard the carts rattle. In one direction from my house there was a colony of muskrats in the river meadows; under the grove of elms and buttonwoods in the other horizon was a village of busy men, as curious to me {{as if they had been}} prairie-dogs, each sitting at the mouth of its burrow, or running over to a neighbor's to gossip. I went there frequently to observe their habits. The village appeared to me a great news room; and on one side, to support it, as once at Redding & Company's on State Street, they kept nuts and raisins, or salt and meal and other groceries. Some have such a vast appetite for the former commodity, that is, the news, and such sound digestive organs, that they can sit forever in public avenues without stirring, and let it simmer and whisper through them like the Etesian winds, or as if inhaling ether, it only producing numbness and insensibility to pain--otherwise it would often be painful to bear--without affecting the consciousness. I hardly ever failed, when I rambled through the village, to see a row of such worthies, either sitting on a ladder sunning themselves, with their bodies inclined forward and their eyes glancing along the line this way and that, from time to time, with a voluptuous expression, or else leaning against a barn with their hands in their pockets, like caryatides, as if to prop it up. They, being commonly out of doors, heard whatever was in the wind. These are the <b>coarsest</b> <b>mills,</b> in which all gossip is first rudely digested or cracked up before it is emptied into finer and more delicate hoppers within doors. I observed that the vitals of the village were the grocery, the bar-room, the post-office, and the bank; and, as a necessary part of the machinery, they kept a bell, a big gun, and a fire-engine, at convenient places; and the houses were so arranged as to make the most of mankind, in lanes and fronting one another, so that every traveller had to run the gauntlet, and every man, woman, and child might get a lick at him. Of course, those who were stationed nearest to the head of the line, where they could most see and be seen, and have the first blow at him, paid the highest prices for their places; and the few straggling inhabitants in the outskirts, where long gaps in the line began to occur, and the traveller could get over walls or turn aside into cow-paths, and so escape, paid a very slight ground or window tax. Signs were hung out on all sides to allure him; some to catch him by the appetite, as the tavern and victualling cellar; some by the fancy, as the dry goods store and the jeweller's; and others by the hair or the feet or the skirts, as the barber, the shoemaker, or the tailor. Besides, there was a still more terrible standing invitation to call at every one of these houses, and company expected about these times. For the most part I escaped wonderfully from these dangers, either by proceeding at once boldly and without deliberation to the goal, as is recommended to those who run the gauntlet, or by keeping my thoughts on high things, like Orpheus, who, [...] "loudly singing the praises of the gods to his lyre, drowned the voices of the Sirens, and kept out of danger." [...] Sometimes I bolted suddenly, and nobody could tell my whereabouts, for I did not stand much about gracefulness, and never hesitated at a gap in a fence. I was even accustomed to make an irruption into some houses, where I was well entertained, and after learning the kernels and very last sieveful of news--what had subsided, the prospects of war and peace, and whether the world was likely to hold together much longer--I was let out through the rear avenues, and so escaped to the woods again.|$|R
40|$|Palm date seeds were milled {{into two}} fractions: fine and coarse. Total dietary fiber (TDF) {{contents}} {{were found to}} be around 71 and 80 % respectively. These fractions were used to replace flour in Saudi Mafrood flat bread at 0, 5 10 and 15 % replacement levels. The corresponding wheat bran replacement levels were used as control. Breads were evaluated by total dietary fiber analysis, dough rheology measurements and by panels of people trained in sensory evaluation. Breads containing milled date seed fraction are slightly lower in protein and slightly higher in fat but substantially higher in total and soluble dietary fiber than the control bread. Coarse fraction at 10 % replacement level was found to increase the TDF fiber contents in bread by four-fold without a significant adverse effect on bread quality. Wheat brain at the same level replacement increased TDF content in bread by only threefold. Furthermore, breads containing 10 % <b>milled</b> <b>coarse</b> fraction were better or similar to the corresponding wheat bran control in sensory evaluation. In contrast, the fine fraction was found to cause a deterioration in bread color, flavor, odour, chewing, uniformity and overall acceptability. These effects increased with increasing concentration of the fine fraction. The farinograph and extensograph were used to study the effect of date seed fractions on dough rheology. The coarse fraction affected the mixing characteristics and extensograph parameters in a relatively similar manner to wheat brain but the fine fraction behaved in a different manner.

40|$|Grinding {{media in}} <b>coarse</b> {{grinding}} tumbling <b>mills</b> constitute the biggest consumable cost to a comminution processing plant, {{therefore it is}} critically important to minimize associated wear. Secondly, efficient grinding is dependent on tight control of the desired ball size distribution, or else optimum impact breakage cannot be assured. Despite the significance of minitoring ball size distribution for mill operation, no practically deployable systems are currently in industry use to measure it. This paper describes a new method for highly accurate, comprehensive, and rapid determination of ball size distribution. Accurate SAG and AG mill product size control is dependent on appropriate Grate Open Area dimensions. Wear of the grate hole edges or in the plate thickness results in an increase of the open area due to the tapered hole cross section, which can result in oversize product exiting the mill. Conversely, some grate castings feature peening of the edges during mill operation, thereby decreasing open area, and therefore preventing the desireed top size product from exiting the mill. SAG mill throughput requires grate holes to remain open or else throughput is restricted. Many grates in operation are pegged by grinding media to varying degrees of severity. This paper introduces a comprehensive, accurate and rapid method to measure and track the size and pegging status of each and all grate holes in situ, and therefore provides tracking information on the Open Area of a SAG mill. This enables operators to control the primary mill product size and therefore the opportunity to stabilize downstream processes...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIComminution, {{particularly}} milling, is {{on average}} the largest consumer {{of energy in}} mining. Actual comminution circuits consist {{in most of the}} cases in <b>coarse</b> crushing, SAG <b>milling,</b> pebble crushing and secondary ball milling. In these circuits the SAG mill is the largest energy consumer. In many engineering projects either a power equation and/or a specific energy equation are used for the designing of these mills but not always with acceptable results. In general these equations are used to predict power consumption as a function of mill size, level and density of the internal charge and % of critical speed. Almost none of these equations (with the notable exception of the Morrell's model) consider explicitly the effect that the feed particle size has on the mill performance, particularly on the power and on the specific energy consumption of the mill. To address this fact new models are developed in this work able to predict power or specific energy consumption, including the usual design variables, but adding a variable that represents the feed size distribution. Operational data from 4 grinding circuits corresponding to 3 Chilean copper concentration plants are used and the % - 6 '' + 1 '' (- 152 + 25 mm) is selected as independent variable. The results indicate that both models are able to estimate the required variables for all data sets. In the first model (power equation) the average error obtained was 3. 7 % and in the second model (specific energy) the average error was 6. 8 %. These models would be useful for performance optimisation of the test case mills and should be fitted (parameters values) again for other mills...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} model {{for use with}} DEM (Discrete Element Method) is proposed for the five mechanisms applying to particle comminution in AG, SAG and <b>coarse</b> feed ball <b>mills.</b> Chipping and rounding are mechanisms that lead to preferential mass loss from corners and edges of particles and which produce shape change for the particles as well as size reduction. These are controlled by the energy dissipation at a contact {{and the location of}} the contact on the surfaces of the particles. These mechanisms lead to rounding or conditioning of angular feed particles. Single impact body breakage is a very weak contributor to overall size reduction with most body breakage occurring via damage accumulation over many contacts. This incremental damage mechanism is inherently less inefficient but leads to size reduction from the many weak collisions experienced by particles within the mill. Finally, size reduction from abrasion is well represented by the shear energy absorption of the particles. Particle size and shape evolution due to chipping, rounding and attrition is demonstrated using a well characterised pilot mill for which detailed particle mass data is available. The relative contributions of the five mechanisms and a quantification of the wasted energy for both AG and SAG charges and for new and substantially comminuted material are reported. Changes in the energy spectra with the decreasing particle sizes over time are described with increases in the fraction of collisions above the elastic energy threshold leading to faster damage accumulation and reduced energy wastage. Finally, it is shown that the attribution of dissipated energy between particles in a collision is material dependent with significantly more energy absorbed by rock particles than balls. This needs to be accounted for in DEM models, particularly when attempting to explicitly predict particle size reduction...|$|R
