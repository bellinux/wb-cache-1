50|$|The books teach a {{systematic}} approach to reading and applying {{the medical literature}} to individual patient care. It focuses on three questions: 1.

To demonstrate the clinical relevance of the suggested approach, each section begins with a practical <b>clinical</b> <b>scenario.</b> The chapter is then structured around identifying the best available evidence and applying the three key questions to the evidence, {{in the context of the}} <b>clinical</b> <b>scenario.</b> Each chapter concludes with a resolution of the scenario.|$|E

40|$|Background and objective: Safe {{prescribing}} requires {{accurate and}} practical information about drugs. Our {{objective was to}} measure the utility of current sources of prescribing guidance when used to inform practical prescribing decisions, and to compare current sources of prescribing guidance in the UK with idealized prescribing guidance. Methods: We developed 25 <b>clinical</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Two independent assessors rated and ranked the performance of five common sources of prescribing guidance in the UK when used to answer the <b>clinical</b> <b>scenarios.</b> A third adjudicator facilitated review of any disparities. An idealized list of contents for prescribing guidance was developed and sent for comments to academics and users of prescribing guidance. Following consultation an operational check {{was used to assess}} compliance with the idealized criteria. The main outcome measures were relative utility in answering the <b>clinical</b> <b>scenarios</b> and compliance with the idealized prescribing guidance. Results: Current sources of prescribing guidance used in the UK differ in their utility, when measured using <b>clinical</b> <b>scenarios.</b> The British National Formulary (BNF) and EMIS LV were the best performing sources in terms of both ranking [mean rank 1 · 24 and 2 · 20] and rating [%excellent or adequate 100 % and 72 %]. Current sources differed in {{the extent to which they}} fulfilled criteria for ideal prescribing guidance, but the BNF, and EMIS LV to a lesser extent, closely matched the criteria. Discussion: We have demonstrated how <b>clinical</b> <b>scenarios</b> can be used to assess prescribing guidance resources. Producers of prescribing guidance documents should consider our idealized template. Prescribers require high-quality information to support their practice. Conclusion: Our test was helpful in distinguishing between prescribing resources. Producers of prescribing guidance should consider the utility of their products to end-users, particularly in those more complex areas where prescribers may need most support. Existing UK prescribing guidance resources differ in their ability to provide assistance to prescribers...|$|R

50|$|SIU-Med employs problem-based learning, which {{involves}} using {{small groups of}} students, along with a faculty mentor. The students are presented with a <b>clinical</b> <b>scenario</b> and must approach it {{as if they were}} trying to diagnose and treat a real patient. Each <b>clinical</b> <b>scenario</b> is accessed on a secure website that provides information about the patient. When the students face basic science and clinical problems that they do not know, they incorporate these issues into a list and divide the list amongst themselves for self-directed learning. At their next faculty-supervised meeting, the students teach each other what they have learned, with input also provided on the topics by the faculty member. Each case also has set learning issues, so that all students in all the small groups within the class learn the objectives planned by the faculty in both basic and clinical science for that particular case. Each case is designed to be completed over three meetings lasting around 9 hours in total. This style of learning is also used with traditional lectures and laboratory sessions over {{the first two years of}} medical school. Simulated patients and nurse educators are also used to assist with learning clinical skills. Since it is more interactive, these methods promote better problem-solving skills useful in real life situations than traditional lecture-based learning. Nearly every medical school in the U.S. uses the problem-based learning model.|$|E

5000|$|The Dialytrauma Concept was {{introduced}} into medical literature in 2008 by a Spanish group of intensivists. The idea was born {{as a consequence}} of the publication of the first major trial (known as the ATN Study) looking at the intensity of renal support in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, renal support was delivered using different RRT modalities: intermittent hemodialysis, sustained low-efficiency dialysis, or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. The main result of this study (including 1,124 patients) was that a fixed “intensive” dose (35 mL/Kg/h) delivered with different RRT modalities, produced the same clinical outcomes than a “less-intensive” dose (20 mL/Kg/h). The authors’ conclusion was that critically ill patients with AKI requiring RRT should be treated with this “less-intensive” dose, given that it will achieve the same results as the “intensive” one. Nevertheless, the rate of complications and adverse events detected was higher in the “intensive” dose arm of this study. As such, the aforementioned Spanish group of intensivists, wrote a letter to the Editor of the same Journal2 postulating the idea that all those complications (grouped under the term “Dialytrauma”) could have been responsible for the results of the ATN Study.In the same letter to the Editor, and according to what had been previously published by Dr. Schiffl, they hypothesized that a dynamic adjustment of the dose of RRT, would be more physiological due to the dynamic nature of AKI in critical illness. This therapeutic schedule, named “Dynamic Approach”, would reduce the incidence of dialytrauma and, probably, would achieve better clinical outcomes.However, given the lack of level 1 clinical trials on this “Theory of Dynamic Approach”, the authors of the ATN Study branded this idea as being “speculative”. Despite this, a year later Dr. Palevsky (ATN Study’s first author) wrote an Editorial comment on the RENAL Study (the second major trial looking at the intensity of renal support) concluding that the: [...] Failure to demonstrate improved outcomes with more intensive renal-replacement therapy in critically ill patients … does not imply that the intensity of renal-replacement therapy does not matter. ... Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that patient care needs to be individualized - more intensive therapy may be required for the treatment of hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, or extreme hypercatabolism - and that the true adequacy of renal-replacement therapy is defined by more than just the clearance of small solutes. Palevsky PM,«Renal Support in Acute Kidney Injury — How Much Is Enough?» (2009)N Engl J Med 361(17):1699-1701. [...] In this way, finally, he seemed to support the Theory of Dynamic Approach, that is: we need to tailor the RRT dose to the <b>clinical</b> <b>scenario</b> of the individual patient. From then on, both the Dialytrauma Concept and the Theory of Dynamic Approach have been referenced in several publications by impact groups in the field of RRT.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDiagnostic {{accuracy}} in FDG-PET imaging highly {{depends on the}} operating procedures. In this clinical study on dementia, we compared the diagnostic accuracy at a single-subject level of a) <b>Clinical</b> <b>Scenarios,</b> b) Standard FDG Images and c) Statistical Parametrical (SPM) Maps generated via a new optimized SPM procedure. We evaluated the added value of FDG-PET, either Standard FDG Images or SPM Maps, to <b>Clinical</b> <b>Scenarios.</b> In 88 patients with neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's Disease—AD, Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration—FTLD, Dementia with Lewy bodies—DLB and Mild Cognitive Impairment—MCI), 9 neuroimaging experts made a forced diagnostic decision {{on the basis of}} the evaluation of the three types of information. There was also the possibility of a decision of normality on the FDG-PET images. The clinical diagnosis confirmed at a long-term follow-up was used as the gold standard. SPM Maps showed higher sensitivity and specificity (96 % and 84 %), and better diagnostic positive (6. 8) and negative (0. 05) likelihood ratios compared to <b>Clinical</b> <b>Scenarios</b> and Standard FDG Images. SPM Maps increased diagnostic accuracy for differential diagnosis (AD vs. FTD; beta 1. 414, p =  0. 019). The AUC of the ROC curve was 0. 67 for SPM Maps, 0. 57 for <b>Clinical</b> <b>Scenarios</b> and 0. 50 for Standard FDG Images.
