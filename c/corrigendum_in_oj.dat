It is controversial whether OJ implies a poorer prognosis and few reports on long-term survival were published. METHOD: This was a retrospective study {{conducted in a}} university centre in Hong Kong. Surgical outcomes and survival of 38 HCC patients presented with OJ and underwent liver resection were analyzed and compared to 228 matched non-OJ HCC patients. RESULTS: Baseline demographics were similar in terms of age, sex, hepatitis B status and presence of co-morbid diseases. Patients <b>in</b> <b>OJ</b> group had a significantly higher preoperative bilirubin (18 vs. 11 mg/dl, p < 0. 001), lower albumin (37. 5 vs. 40 g/l, p = 0. 001) and more patients were of Child’s B (42. 1 vs. 3. 1 %, p < 0. 001). Other parameters including INR (1. 1 vs. 1, p = 0. 186), indocyanine green retention at 15 minutes (13 vs. 11. 3, p = 0. 267) and alpha fetoprotein (63 vs. 175 ng/ml, p = 0. 75) were the same. Majority of patients (34 / 38, 89. 5 %) with OJ required preoperative intervention to alleviate jaundice. Thirty-three patients (86. 8 %) and 167 (73. 2 %) <b>in</b> <b>OJ</b> and control group underwent major hepatectomy (p = 0. 07) respectively. More patients <b>in</b> <b>OJ</b> group required hepaticojejunostomy (12 / 38 vs. 4 / 228, p < 0. 001) and portal vein resection (4 / 38 vs. 3 / 228, p = 0. 007). Operative time was longer <b>in</b> <b>OJ</b> group (488. 5 vs. 400 minutes, p = 0. 002), more blood loss (1. 33 vs. 0. 9 l, p = 0. 019) and had more complications (50 vs. 31. 1 %, p = 0. 023) but hospital mortality was the same (2. 6 vs. 3. 9 %, p = 0. 844). The 5 -year overall and disease free survival were similar; 37. 4 % vs. 33. 7 % and 20. 5 % vs. 20. 8 % <b>in</b> <b>OJ</b> and control group respectively. Prognosis was poorer in those with larger tumor, presence of microvascular permeation, higher prothrombin time and more blood loss while OJ itself would not confer an inferior survival.

TNF-α production by peritoneal exudate cells (PEC), both spontaneous and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - induced was determined by a bioassay. <b>In</b> <b>OJ</b> rats the process of both early as well as late phase of healing was impaired.

40|$|This paper proposes an Optimality-Theoretic {{alternative}} to the wh-movement analysis of Old Japanese (OJ:?- 8 C). Diachronic aspects of Japanese have recently aroused strong interest in theoretical linguists, both functional and formal. Among the most remarkable works is Watanabe’s (2002) Minimalist analysis, which claims that <b>OJ</b> was <b>in</b> fact a wh-movement language. Japanese {{has always been a}} head-final (SOV), free-word order (scrambling) language. It was never expected that it went through a dramatic change in parameter setting. For this reason, Watanabe (2002) had a great impact on Japanese syntacticians, and it has been so influential that its claim is almost taken as a “discovery ” of the unknown “fact ” of the Japanese language (but cf. Tonoike (2002, 2003)). However, Watanabe’s (2002) analysis has some serious problems. This paper argues that Watanabe’s (2002) claim is wrong and that OJ did not have overt wh-movement. The observed word order pattern results from the interplay of several constraints, which basically have to do with morphological case marking. The proposed analysis not only accommodates the fact covered by the wh-movement analysis, but offers a more comprehensive picture of the development of the Japanese language during 8 - 10 C. 1. Word order restriction <b>in</b> <b>OJ</b> and Watanabe’s (2002) claim Watanabe’s (2002) claim is based on the word order restriction <b>in</b> <b>OJ,</b> which disappeared <b>in</b> early Middle Japanese (MJ: 9 - 12 C). Through a thorough examination of data of Man’yosyu (c. 750 ?: the only available text <b>in</b> <b>OJ),</b> regarding the distribution of the interrogative particle [ka], the topic marker [wa], and the subject marker [no/ga], Nomura (1993) and Sasaki (1992) conclude that [ka] almost always preceded [no/ga], while [wa] almost always preceded [ka]: number of the dat...|$|R
40|$|Both {{a single}} {{equation}} model and Rotterdam demand system {{were used to}} estimate the impact of advertising on <b>OJ</b> demand. <b>In</b> the single equation model, OJ gallon sales were related to OJ advertising, grapefruit juice advertising, the price of OJ, seasonality variables, consumer income, and a dummy variable for September 11 to further capture possible effect resulting from changes in the U. S. economy and consumer confidence after that point in time. The impact {{of each of these}} variables was estimated by applying the ordinary least squares regression method to data from September 1997 to November 2001. The results suggest that recent decreases <b>in</b> <b>OJ</b> demand are related to declines in FDOC advertising, as well as perhaps declines in incomes and changes in consumer behavior since September 11.

The {{aim of this}} study was to monitor plasma tumor necrosis factor α (TNF‐α) and interleukin‐ 6 (IL‐ 6) levels in rats with obstructive jaundice. MethodsThe ability of splenocytes and peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) to produce these cytokines both spontaneously and on induction with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), was compared in rats with and without obstructive jaundice (OJ). The activity of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) was also measured. ResultsSerum cytokine levels <b>in</b> <b>OJ</b> rats were higher than in control rats. PEC cultures produced significantly more IL‐ 6, compared with control rats, declining thereafter. TNF‐α activity in the splenocyte cultures of OJ rats was also higher than in the control group. Pronounced differences were found in the ability to produce TNF‐α by PEC, i. e., TNF‐α production was much stronger on day 7 <b>in</b> <b>OJ</b> rats than <b>in</b> controls. On day 14 TNF‐α production was much lower and the spontaneous response was equal to the LPS‐induced one. On day 21 the cells of OJ rats partially regained the ability to produce TNF‐α. RES activity of OJ rats was significantly suppressed in the liver and spleen, whereas the phagocytic activity in the lungs was elevated. ConclusionWe have demonstrated that the immune reactivity of OJ rats, intially elevated, underwent subsequent depression.
