25|$|The {{nephew of}} one of the men {{responsible}} for popularity of the penny-farthing was largely responsible for its demise. James Starley had built the Ariel (spirit of the air) high-wheeler in 1870; but this was a time of innovation, and when <b>chain</b> <b>drives</b> were upgraded so that each link had a small roller, higher and higher speeds became possible without the large wheel. In 1885, Starley's nephew John Kemp Starley took these new developments to launch the Rover Safety Bicycle, so-called because the rider, seated much lower and farther behind the front wheel contact point, was less prone to a header.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, a {{prototype}} and two production {{units of the}} diamond framed Indian Single were successfully designed, built and tested. The first Indian motorcycles, having <b>chain</b> <b>drives</b> and streamlined styling, were sold {{to the public in}} 1902. In 1903, Indian's co-founder and chief engineer Oscar Hedstrom set the world motorcycle speed record of 56mph. In 1904 the company introduced the deep red color that would become Indian's trademark. Annual production of Indian motorcycles then exceeded 500, rising to a peak of 32,000 in 1913. The engines of the Indian Single were built by the Aurora Firm in Illinois under license from the Hendee Mfg. Co. until 1906.|$|E

In this article a structure related to a slide constraint <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> is presented and optimized by means of MATLAB optimization toolbox.

40|$|In {{hydraulic}} manipulator applications effective joints movement range of above 180 ° is often needed. Vane actuator has maximum movement range about 270 °. However, water hydraulic vane actuators are quite expensive to manufacture. Thus we investigate a possibility to use so called <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> instead of vane actuator. <b>Chain</b> <b>drive</b> {{consists of two}} cylinders which are connected in series with a chain. Reduced model for chain-drive equals to symmetric cylinder and can be compared with a vane actuator of same size. Concerns with <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> are the smoothness of sprocket turning around, stiffness of the chain and minimum required back-pressure level for keeping chain tension. In this paper a <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> is designed, built and tested. We also compare <b>chain</b> <b>drive's</b> and vane actuator's properties mathematically from control point of view. We can conclude that <b>chain</b> <b>drive's</b> characteristics almost equal with vane actuator and {{it is much more}} cost effective...|$|R

40|$|The {{conveyor}} <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> {{system which}} included four sprockets, four flat bars (chain guides) and one conveyor chain had been assembled into commercial software, MSC. ADAMS. The conveyor chain was connected with rollers for {{running on the}} chain guides.

500|$|<b>Chain</b> <b>drive,</b> endless power-transmitting: The Greek Philon of Byzantium (3rd or 2nd century BC) {{described}} a <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> and windlass {{used in the}} operation of a polybolos (a repeating ballista), [...] "but the <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> did not continuously transmit power from shaft to shaft and hence they were not in the direct line of ancestry of the chain-drive proper". A continuously <b>driven</b> <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> first appeared in 11th century China. Perhaps inspired by chain pumps which had been known in China since at least the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) when they were mentioned by the Chinese philosopher Wang Chong (27– c. 100 AD), the endless power-transmitting <b>chain</b> <b>drive</b> was first used in the gearing of the clock tower built at Kaifeng in 1090 by the Song Chinese politician, mathematician and astronomer Su Song (1020–1101).|$|R
2500|$|In 1913, the schoolboy Reginald F. Mann, a {{successful}} designer and builder of model aircraft, {{set up the}} company [...] "Mann & Grimmer" [...] at Surbiton, London with his teacher Robert T. Grimmer to build model aircraft on a commercial scale. The outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 resulted in Mann starting {{the design of a}} two-seat machine gun-armed aircraft. Mann wanted his design to combine a good field of fire for the observer's machine gun, as found in pusher configuration aircraft, with the higher performance found in tractor aircraft. To meet these requirements, his design featured a deep conventional fuselage, powered by a single engine mounted in the nose, which drove two 2-bladed pusher propellers that were mounted behind and between the wings, via a long shaft to a gearbox and <b>chain</b> <b>drives</b> to the propellers. The observer sat in the nose of the aircraft, just behind the engine, while the pilot sat in a separate cockpit behind the trailing edge of the wings. It had two-bay wings with a swept leading edge and ailerons on upper and lower wings. It had a fixed conventional landing gear.|$|E
