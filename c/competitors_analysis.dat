50|$|Factors such as pricing of <b>competitors,</b> <b>analysis</b> {{of current}} market costs and sales for each grade of fuel are all {{considerations}} {{that affect the}} outcome of fuel prices. In addition to this, sales by related convenience stores can effectively subsidize the fuel, lowering the price. Some software is designed to integrate with point-of-sale systems, pumps, wetstock systems providers, and electronic price signs to automate instant price changes. This saves store staff the inconvenience of changing gas price signs manually and allows retailers to more responsively post optimal pricing, even monitoring the market in real time. Fuel pricing software is intended to replace manual or spreadsheet-based processes that could delay the update of fuel costs and jeopardize profit margins. Delayed updates of fuels costs can cause fuel buyers {{to pay more than}} necessary, with day-to-day price swings occurring at 3 cents nearly 50% of the time and 5 cents at just over 25%.|$|E

This method has the property that {{large parts of the}} matrix factors are not stored; they are (implicitly) regenerated as needed during the solution process.

40|$|<b>Competitor</b> <b>Analysis</b> (CA) is an {{important}} part of the strategic planning process. By spying every move of the competitors offers a company an advantageous position in decision making. With the advent of World-Wide-Web technology, many businesses extend their activities to the Internet platform, from online marketing to customer services, thereby left over traces of valuable information for <b>competitor</b> <b>analysis.</b> The scattered information can be collected from the Web for studying what the competitors are doing and what products and services they offer up-todate. In the past CA was conducted manually and it was a tedious process. The sources of such Web information are diversified and the contents are updated frequently too. It is therefore desirable to build an efficient and automated tool that gathers competitor information, monitors the updates and formulates them into useful competitor intelligence with minimum human intervention. Although many information retrieval and monitoring technologies have been developed, they are more for generally tracking changes and downloading the whole websites for offline browsing. In this paper, a framework of automated <b>competitor</b> <b>analysis</b> is proposed as a holistic solution. It is a Web monitoring tool that works for both Web 1. 0 and Web 2. 0.
