5000|$|In July 2012, the Windows 8 team {{posted the}} {{following}} on the blog of Steven Sinofsky: [...] "To improve geometry rendering performance in Windows 8, {{we focused on}} reducing the CPU cost associated with tessellation in two ways. First, we optimized our implementation of tessellation when rendering simple geometries like rectangles, lines, rounded rectangles, and ellipses." [...] These common-case optimizations claimed to improve performance {{in the range of}} 184% to 438%, depending on the primitive. The post continued: [...] "Second, to improve performance when rendering irregular geometry (e.g. geographical borders on a map), we use a new graphics hardware feature called Target Independent Rasterization, or TIR. TIR enables Direct2D to spend fewer CPU cycles on tessellation, so it can give drawing instructions to the GPU more quickly and efficiently, without sacrificing visual quality. TIR is available in new GPU hardware designed for Windows 8 that supports DirectX 11.1." [...] This was followed by a benchmark using some 15 SVGs, <b>claiming</b> <b>performance</b> improvements in the range of 151% to 523%. The section concluded: [...] "We worked closely with our graphics hardware partners to design TIR. Dramatic improvements were made possible because of that partnership. DirectX 11.1 hardware is already on the market today and we’re working with our partners to make sure more TIR-capable products will be broadly available." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) {{as a potential}} alternative to conventional general-purpose processors has led to significant interest in these architectures by both the academic community and the High Performance Computing (HPC) industry. While GPUs look likely to deliver unparalleled levels of performance, the publication of studies <b>claiming</b> <b>performance</b> improvements in excess of 30, 000 x are misleading. Significant on-node performance improvements have been demonstrated for code kernels and algorithms amenable to GPU acceleration; studies demonstrating comparable results for full scientific applications requiring multiple-GPU architectures are rare. In this paper we present an analysis of a port of the NAS LU benchmark to NVIDIA’s Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) - the most stable GPU programming model currently available. Our solution is also extended to multiple nodes and multiple GPU devices. Runtime performance on several GPUs is presented, ranging from low-end, consumer-grade cards such as the 8400 GS to NVIDIA’s flagship Fermi HPC processor found in the recently released C 2050. We compare the runtimes of these devices to several processors including those from Intel, AMD and IBM. In addition to this we utilise a recently developed performance model of LU. With this we predict the runtime performance of LU on large-scale distributed GPU clusters, which are predicted to become commonplace in future highend HPC architectural solutions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently, a fast modular multiexponentiation {{algorithm}} for computing A X B Y (mod N) {{was proposed}} [15]. The authors claimed that on average their algorithm only requires to perform 1. 306 k modular multiplications (MMs), where k is the bit {{length of the}} exponents. This <b>claimed</b> <b>performance</b> is significantly better than all other comparable algorithms, where the best known result by other algorithms achieves 1. 503 k MMs only. In this paper, we give a formal complexity analysis and show the <b>claimed</b> <b>performance</b> is not true. The actual computational complexity of the algorithm should be 1. 556 k. This means that the best known modular multiexponentiation algorithm based on canonical-sighed-digit technique is still not able to overcome the 1. 5 k barrier...|$|R

40|$|Authentication systems {{based on}} {{biometric}} features (e. g., fingerprint impressions, iris scans, human face images, etc.) are increasingly gaining widespread use and popularity. Often, vendors and owners of these commercial biometric systems <b>claim</b> impressive <b>performance</b> {{based on some}} propriety data. In such situations, {{there is a need}} to independently validate the <b>claimed</b> <b>performance</b> levels. System performance is typically evaluated by collecting biometric templates from n different subjects, and for convenience, acquiring multiple instances of the biometric for each of the n subjects. Very little work has been done in constructing confidence regions for the <b>claimed</b> <b>performance</b> levels and also in determining the required number of subjects needed to establish pre-specified confidence regions. To simplify the analysis, several previous studies have assumed that multiple acquisitions of the biometric entity are statistically independent. This assumption is too restrictive and is generally not valid. In this paper, we present a semi-parametric model based on multivariate copula models for correlated biometric acquisitions. Based on this approach, confidence bands for the <b>claimed</b> <b>performance,</b> expressed in terms of the ROC curve, are constructed. We also give the minimum number of subjects needed to achieve a width of 1 % for the ROC confidence bands. Using fingerprints as our biometric, experimental results show that we need approximately 11, 000 subjects to achieve a width of 1 % for the 95 % ROC confidence band. The required number of subjects increases when either one or both of the inter-finger and intra-finger correlations increase. For achieving the desired confidence level, the required number of subjects based on our method is much smaller compared to other methods of selecting sample sizes, such as the subset bootstrap...|$|R

40|$|Adoption of 3 D imaging {{systems is}} on the rise with the global market {{expected}} to exceed $ 450 million by 2016. An increasing number of users are expected to invest in high-accuracy/high-speed non-contact systems as their <b>claimed</b> <b>performance</b> approaches the <b>claimed</b> <b>performance</b> of tactile probing systems, particularly as the cost of non-contact systems has decreased significantly. To address the lack of published standards for 3 D imaging systems, the National Research Council of Canada (NRCC) has been working closely with NIST on the ASTM E 57 committee to develop two standards to evaluate the performance of medium-range (2 to 150 m) LiDAR systems.
