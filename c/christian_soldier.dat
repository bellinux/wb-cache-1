[...] As word of his death spread, Brown inspired numerous other African Americans to become pilots, notably Seaman Apprentice Frank E. Petersen. Petersen would become the first African-American Marine Corps aviator and the first African-American Marine Corps general, being graduated from the Naval Aviation Training Program in 1952 and retiring from the military after 38 years in 1988 with the rank of lieutenant general.|$|E
500|$|Coey's {{request to}} {{transfer}} to the Rhodesian Army Medical Corps was granted, and he was accordingly placed in a three-month medical course in Bulawayo, starting in April 1974. On its completion in July, {{he was promoted to}} corporal and posted to the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI) heliborne commando battalion, where he was installed as an instructor. He expressed pride in teaching [...] "as we did at Quantico—the Marine way!" [...] He was pleased to meet other Americans in the RLI, particularly when they were fellow US Marines. The American expatriates in the Rhodesian forces tended to try to stay together and associate with each other. They were later informally dubbed [...] "the Crippled Eagles" [...] by the American author Robin Moore, who moved to Salisbury in August 1976 and became their unofficial patron. Coey liked and respected his fellow soldiers, who in turn regarded him as strong, capable and brave, but there was mutual animosity concerning their respective lifestyles while off-duty. [...] "They live for pleasure mostly," [...] Coey wrote in his journal, [...] "drinking and whoring. The <b>Christian</b> <b>soldier</b> is sometimes despised and ridiculed." ...|$|E

[...] However, according to Sears, [...] "this fanatical religiosity had drawbacks. It warped Jackson's judgment of men, leading to poor appointments; it was said he preferred good Presbyterians to good soldiers." [...] James I. Robertson, Jr. {{suggests that}} Jackson was [...] "a <b>Christian</b> <b>soldier</b> {{in every sense of}} the word." [...] According to Robertson, Jackson [...] "thought of the war as a religious crusade," [...] and [...] "viewed himself as an Old Testament warrior – like David or Joshua – who went into battle to slay the Philistines." ...|$|E

2500|$|In The Golden Bough, J.G. Frazer {{interpreted}} {{an incident}} from the Acts of Saint Dasius, an early martyrological text, as indicative of human sacrifice {{in connection with}} the Saturnalia. Dasius was a <b>Christian</b> <b>soldier</b> who refused to play the part of the King of the Saturnalia when it was allotted to him, and for his refusal was killed. From this anecdote, Frazer surmises that the King of the Saturnalia was originally a scapegoat victim who was killed as a human sacrifice to Saturn {{at the end of his}} festival. Since the role of the [...] "king" [...] is not attested before the Imperial period, this interpretation is not generally accepted by modern specialists of Roman religion. The martyrdom of Dasius took place at Durostorum in the province of Moesia Inferior on 20 November 303 AD, the anniversary of Diocletian's accession as emperor (dies imperii) and nearly a month before the date of the communal sacrifice for the Saturnalia (December 17). The execution occurred more broadly in the context of general harassment of Christians in the Roman military during the Diocletianic Persecution, the edict for which had been issued in February of that year, and only after Dasius refused to venerate Imperial icons. K.M. Coleman regards the martyrdom of Dasius as an enactment of scapegoat ritual, but likens it to the ritualized executions that took place as mythological scenarios in the arena, with the costuming and role of the Christian meant to enhance the purposes of retributive justice and the restoration of the pax deorum. As an element of martyr narrative, the torture of the mock [...] "king" [...] may recall the mocking of Jesus of Nazareth by Roman soldiers in the Gospels of Mark and Matthew.|$|E

60|$|Suddenly a low sweet sound broke on Nicholas's ear. It swelled gradually, and was {{at length}} {{recognised}} as a hymn with {{which he had been}} familiar in childhood.

6000|$|He {{went with}} a fine army in ships down the Euphrates, and thence marched into Persia, where King Sapor was wise enough to avoid a battle, and only retreat before him. The Romans were half starved, and obliged to turn back. Then Sapor {{attacked}} their rear, and cut off their stragglers. Julian shared all the sufferings of his troops, and was always wherever there was danger. At last a javelin pierced him under the arm. It is said that he caught some of his blood in his other hand, cast it up towards heaven, and cried, [...] "Galilean, Thou hast conquered." [...] He died in a few hours, in 363, and the Romans could only choose the best leader they knew {{to get them out}} of the sad plight they were in--almost that of the ten thousand Greeks, except that they knew the roads and had friendly lands much nearer. Their choice fell on a plain, honest <b>Christian</b> <b>soldier</b> named Jovian, who did his best by making a treaty with Sapor, giving up all claim to any lands beyond the Tigris, and surrendering the brave city of Nisibis which had held out so gallantly--a great grief to the Eastern Christians.

60|$|We {{have yet}} another act to relate of this good count de Tendilla, {{who was in}} truth a mirror of knightly virtue. One day a <b>Christian</b> <b>soldier,</b> just escaped from captivity in Granada, brought word to the count that an illustrious damsel named Fatima, niece of the alcayde Aben Comixa, was {{to leave the city}} on a certain day, escorted by a {{numerous}} party of relatives and friends of distinguished rank, on a journey to Almunecar, there to embark for the African coast to celebrate her nuptials with the alcayde of Tetuan. This was too brilliant a prize to be neglected. The count accordingly sallied forth with a light company of cavalry, and, descending the defiles of the mountains, stationed himself behind the rocky sierra of Elvira, not far from the eventful bridge of Pinos, within a few short miles of Granada. Hence he detached Alonso de Cardenas Ulloa, with fifty light horsemen, to post himself in ambush by the road the bridal party had to travel. After a time the latter came in sight, proving less numerous than had been expected, for the damsel was escorted merely by four armed domestics and accompanied by a few relatives and two female attendants. The whole party was surrounded and captured almost without resistance, and carried off to the count at the bridge of Pinos. The good count conveyed his beautiful captive to his stronghold at Alcala, where he treated her and her companions with all the delicacy and respect due to their rank and to his own character as a courteous cavalier.|$|E
6000|$|... 'This memorable event,' {{says the}} pious writer, 'happened towards {{the middle of}} July 1719. The major had spent the evening (and, if I mistake not, it was the Sabbath) in some gay company, and had an unhappy {{assignation}} with a married woman, whom he was to attend exactly at twelve. The company broke up about eleven, and, not judging it convenient to anticipate the time appointed, he went into his chamber to kill the tedious hour, perhaps with some amusing book, or some other way. But it very accidentally happened that he took up a religious book, which his good mother or aunt had, without his knowledge, slipped into his portmanteau. It was called, if I remember the title exactly, The <b>Christian</b> <b>Soldier,</b> or Heaven taken by Storm, and {{it was written by}} Mr. Thomas Watson. Guessing by the title of it that he would find some phrases of his own profession spiritualised in a manner which he thought might afford him some diversion, he resolved to dip into it, but he took no serious notice of anything it had in it; and yet, while this book was in his hand, an impression was made upon his mind (perhaps God only knows how) which drew after it a train of the most important and happy consequences. He thought he saw an unusual blaze of light fall upon the book which he was reading, which he at first imagined might happen by some accident in the candle, but, lifting up his eyes, he apprehended to his extreme amazement that there was before him, as it were suspended in the air, a visible representation of the Lord Jesus Christ upon the cross, surrounded on all sides with a glory; and was impressed as if a voice, or something equivalent to a voice, had come to him, to this effect (for he was not confident as to the words), [...] "Oh, sinner! did I suffer this for thee, and are these thy returns?" [...] Struck with so amazing a phenomenon as this, there remained hardly any life in him, so that he sunk down in the arm-chair in which he sat, and continued, he knew not how long, insensible.' ...|$|E
