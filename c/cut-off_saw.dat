50|$|A {{concrete}} saw (also {{known as a}} consaw, road saw, <b>cut-off</b> <b>saw</b> or quick cut) is a power tool used for cutting concrete, masonry, brick, asphalt, tile, and other solid materials. It can be a small hand-held <b>cut-off</b> <b>saw,</b> a big walk-behind saw or other styles, {{and it may be}} powered by gasoline, hydraulic or pneumatic pressure, or electric motors. The saw blades used on {{concrete saw}}s are often diamond saw blades to cut concrete, asphalt, stone, etc. Abrasive cut-off wheels can also be used on cut-off saws to cut stone and steel. The significant friction generated in cutting hard substances like concrete usually requires the blades to be cooled to prolong their life and reduce dust.|$|E
50|$|An {{abrasive}} saw, {{also known}} as a <b>cut-off</b> <b>saw</b> or chop saw, is a power tool which is typically used to cut hard materials, such as metals, tile, and concrete. The cutting action is performed by an abrasive disc, similar to a thin grinding wheel. Technically speaking this is not a saw, as it does not use regularly shaped edges (teeth) for cutting.|$|E

50|$|Special {{band saws}} {{designed}} for cutting metal have hardened blades and a feed mechanism for even cutting. Abrasive <b>cut-off</b> <b>saws,</b> {{also known as}} chop saws, are similar to miter saws but with a steel cutting abrasive disk. Cutting torches can cut very large sections of steel with little effort.|$|R
50|$|Since their introduction, {{portable}} <b>cut-off</b> <b>saws</b> {{have made}} many building site jobs easier. With these saws, lightweight steel fabrication previously performed in workshops using stationary power bandsaws or cold saws {{can be done}} on-site. Abrasive saws have replaced more expensive and hazardous acetylene torches in many applications, such as cutting rebar. In addition, these saws allow construction workers to cut through concrete, asphalt, and pipe on job sites in a more precise manner than is possible with heavy equipment.|$|R

40|$|American Society of Mechanical EngineersWhen {{a machine}} tool is mounted {{at the tip}} of a robotic {{manipulator}}, the manipulator becomes more flexible (the natural frequencies are lowered). Moreover, for a given flexible manipulator, its compliance will be different depending on feedback gains, configurations, and direction of interest. In this paper, the compliance of a manipulator is derived analytically, and magnitude is represented as a compliance ellipsoid. Then, using a two link flexible manipulator with an abrasive <b>cut-off</b> <b>saw,</b> the experimental investigation shows that the chattering varies with the saw cutting angle due to the different compliance.

40|$|The European Directive 2000 / 14 /EC sets a {{requirement}} for noise labelling for the sound power level of 57 types of outdoor equipment, and sound power limits for 22 of these. In the NOMEVAL project the Directive and its amendment 2005 / 88 /EC were evaluated, resulting in recommendations for an update of the equipment list, the noise limits and the test codes. A European database of noise emission data was assessed, and environmental bodies and industry were consulted. The recommendations were also based on environmental, technical and economic impact assessments. A new environmental indicator was applied to rank {{the impact of the}} different equipment types. It was found that many types currently without noise limits have a higher impact than those with noise limits. Some new types of equipment have been identified including snowmobiles, mobile waste breakers and and screens, motorised brooms, handheld <b>cut-off</b> <b>saws</b> and power pruners. The technical impact assessment was based on current technology and trends and the feasibility of new of stricter limits. The economic impact assessment was based on estimated societal benefits versus the estimated additional cost to the consumer or purchaser.

50|$|Hertz {{convinced}} {{the client to}} purchase the 747 airplane, originally worth about $25 million when Boeing completed it in 1970, for US $30,000. Mark Thompson of Thompson Aviation sold the airplane and his team detoxified, cut apart, and transported the plane for airlift. Using a laser and the <b>cut-off</b> <b>saws</b> at the Victorville Airport, home of the second largest airplane graveyard in the nation, the cockpit and tail were removed and the fuselage cut longitudinally. Next, transverse sectioning reduced large segments of fuselage and the wings to a manageable size for transport. A truck carried the parts, measuring 47 ft. by 125 ft., successfully without damage. Seven California Highway Patrol vehicles escorted the truck during the night and closed multiple lanes of three major freeways, State Routes 2 and 15, and US Route 101, to accommodate the vehicle. The wings traveled from the Southern California Logistics Airport aircraft boneyard to Camarillo Airport in Oxnard, California, located 10 miles from the site. At that point, because each wing weighed approximately 20,000 pounds {{and the only way}} to transport such heavy, unwieldy sections to a remote destination was from above (navigation by truck was deemed impossible), the wings needed to be cut in two for proper positioning for transport by helicopter, which was completed by a Columbia Model 234 operated by Columbia Helicopters Inc. of Portland, Oregon and took over two hours to complete. The helicopter positioned the wings on a large pile of tires at the site. The wings were then spliced back together and lifted onto columnar supports, attaching the custom fabricated steel brackets on the columns to the engine mounts on the wings. The wings touched the ground at few points creating minimal foundation requirements.|$|R
40|$|Efficient lumber {{utilization}} at the saw is a {{key issue}} in the woodworking industry because of shrinking supply and increasing raw material prices. In this thesis, the formulation of the cross-cut-first method of cutting defects out of lumber, as a one-dimensional stock cutting problem, is discussed, with the objective to maximize yield. Monte-Carlo simulations were used for generating boards of a given grade, to test and compare alternative solution procedures. A fast heuristic for solving the above problem is introduced to enable a real-time computerized implementation. The heuristic is shown to compare favorably with the algorithmic solution obtained, using Kolesar's knapsack algorithm, in terms of solution time and yield. The system is also capable of automatically assigning cutting priorities to reflect demand and production needs. In addition, the cut-rip defect removal strategy is introduced. The results {{of a set of}} experiments designed to evaluate the heuristic procedure as applied to the cut-off and cut-rip strategies are reviewed, in comparison to the operator's performance. Finally, the implementation issues on an automated <b>cut-off</b> <b>saw</b> are presented...|$|E
40|$|Excessive {{exposure}} to crystalline silica remains {{prevalent in the}} U. S. construction industry. Chronic inhalation of respirable crystalline silica {{is associated with the}} development of progressive pulmonary fibrosis and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung cancer and various autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, chronic renal disease, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Although the relationship between silica-containing dust and pulmonary disease has been documented for centuries, the pathways triggering a progressive and untreatable disease state remain largely unclear. Attenuation of silica-related disease is dependent upon improved methods for assessing and reducing dust exposure, but a latent exposure-response to this abundant mineral reinforces the need for better biological indicators of chronic exposure and improved knowledge of biological interactions from silica mixtures. In the most recent National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) for Construction, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has requested research to advance current deficiencies in hazard communication, dust control, and exposure assessment for silica exposures and related illnesses. The central purpose of this dissertation was to characterize unevaluated silica-related dust exposures and exposure controls while advancing methods for outdoor exposure assessment and communication of risk for task-based operations in roadway construction. During an exposure assessment of concrete curb cutting with a hand-held <b>cut-off</b> <b>saw,</b> wet suppression and local exhaust ventilation (LEV) control were found to significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) reduce personal respirable dust exposure by + 78. 0 percent and + 73. 2 percent respectively when compared to no dust control, an exposure scenario where crystalline silica exposure was estimated to exceed the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV) by almost 40 times. Videos of these exposure control methods were presented side-by-side with real-time dust concentration to local construction supervisors followed by an anonymous survey. Supervisors answered 2 ̆ 2 yes 2 ̆ 2 on 85 percent of returned surveys when asked if they would consider changing current uncontrolled work practices {{as a result of the}} training. During an exposure assessment of asphalt grinding with a cold-planer equipment attachment, an 80 percent increase in respirable dust exposure was observed for wet suppression when compared to no dust control during matched wind conditions, identifying a unique flaw in wet control technology. A new systematic method of reporting wind condition also identified that exposure can differ significantly by more than 1000 percent across 30 degree by 400 feet per minute (fpm) wind condition categories (WCCs). Reporting outdoor exposure data using the methods developed in this assessment will allow future researchers to easily compare tool-specific exposure during specific wind conditions, ultimately improving outdoor exposure assessments and reducing selection error for dust controls. During an exposure assessment of soil stabilization with lime and cement mixtures, excessive overexposures to Portland cement and calcium oxide were identified for multiple work tasks, but simultaneous {{exposure to}} crystalline silica was either non-detectable or below the ACGIH TLV in all mixed dust samples. These same four workers evaluated in the soil stabilization assessment were individually matched with four non-exposed roadway workers by gender (male), race (Caucasian), age (± 2 years), height (± 3 in.), and pack-years (± 2. 5 pack years). The natural log of the difference in cumulative calcium exposure between each matched pair was a significant predictor (p 3 ̆c 0. 05, r 2 = 0. 98) of the natural log of the difference in sputum neutrophil count. In the context of prior research, this indicates that the neutrophils remain present during tissue repair and after inflammation subsides, providing further evidence of possible mechanisms of disease potentiation by metallic irritants co-generated with quartz. Collectively, this study advanced silica exposure assessment and control by quantifying exposure for multiple dust-generating tasks, determining the effectiveness of unevaluated tool-specific dust controls, surveying the perception of tool-specific video exposure training among construction supervisors, developing a new methodology for reporting and adjusting exposure by wind condition, and detecting a possible field-friendly biological marker of cumulative exposure for a substance that commonly accompanies silica in construction dust. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the dust reduction capabilities of currently available wet suppression and local exhaust ventilation (LEV) methods for gas-powered <b>cut-off</b> <b>saws</b> during the sawing of concrete curb on highway construction worksites. Dust control efficiency (e. g. concrete displacement rate) and weather conditions (e. g. wind) were also monitored to determine their effects on dust reduction. Personal filter cassette sampling revealed a median percent reduction in respirable (RSP) dust concentrations of 87. 7 percent for the wet sawing method (WSM) and 87. 0 percent for the LEV sawing method (LSM) compared to the traditional dry sawing method (DSM). A statistically significant difference (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) was seen between both the WSM and LSM compared to the DSM; however, no significant difference (p= 0. 118) was seen between the WSM and LSM. Based on estimated values of percent quartz, the RSP quartz reduction was approximately 84. 4 percent for the WSM and 77. 1 for the LSM. If workers are only exposed to RSP silica during the normal two hour cutting duration, the WSM and LSM would reduce RSP silica concentrations below the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Recommended Exposure Limit (REL). ^ Concrete displacement rates revealed a 63. 1 percent reduction in productivity for the WSM and 40. 0 percent reduction in productivity for the LSM compared to the DSM. After adjusting the traditional two hour cutting time for reductions in productivity, exposure was shown to increase by 33 percent for the WSM and 29 percent for the LSM. Although both the WSM and LSM were still below the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL), they were no longer below the NIOSH REL after this adjustment. A combination of wind speed and wind direction was also shown to be a significant predictor (p= 0. 02) of exposure during the DSM. Video exposure monitoring revealed the WSM was more consistent in reducing peak RSP dust concentrations, but overall reductions were still similar between the WSM and LSM. Based on these findings, standardized methods of quantifying dust control effectiveness should be implemented by manufacturers to ensure proper use and appropriate comparisons between engineering controls. ...|$|R
