40|$|This paper explores how motorcars and car-based {{cultural}} practices {{operate in the}} construction of young working-class masculine identities. It draws on ethnographic fieldwork conducted during the summer of 2002 with young male car modifiers from the Midlands and North Wales who associated with the British cruising scene. Although this study is broadly framed by the youth cultural world of cruising, it does not approach car modification as a collective cultural phenomenon or draw on subcultural theory, but instead examines young men's relationships with their cars in terms of general theories of consumption and identity and theories of cultural production. The car modifiers participating in this study frequently resisted calls to collectivity and repeatedly endorsed a heavily individualised discourse of consumption. As consumers of the motorcar, they constituted themselves as absolutely individual {{on the basis of their}} ownership of modified cars that they constituted as culturally unique. Car modification operated as a set of identity practices organised around the active consumption and symbolic manipulation of standard motorcars and the cultural production of idiosyncratic signifiers of masculine identity. Through car modification, young working-class men discursively distanced themselves from the mass of standard car-owning subjects and constituted themselves as ‘unique’ car-owning individuals who were culturally privileged. This <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>privilege</b> was predicated on their capacity to produce highly conspicuous motorcars, which they viewed as a source of considerable cultural capital...|$|E

30|$|An {{interesting}} further {{component of}} meritocratic practices of assigning bundles of differential rewards to particular jobs {{is the role}} of “responsibility” as a yardstick of desert and the attribution of status. The notion of responsibility matches the nature of tasks and of the persons that perform them. Some jobs are said to involve greater personal responsibility than others, which is usually intended to mean: If those performing them fail to apply the rules of their trade and to appropriately exert their cognitive and motivational capacities, the potential damage caused by such failure would be greater than in the case of others. Therefore, the greater the responsibility (as measured in terms of potential damage – think of an airline pilot) the greater the remuneration deserved. This reasoning assumes that “responsibility” is subjectively perceived as a kind of work disutility or burden that calls for an adequate compensation. This perception {{may or may not be}} present, which is anyway as hard to prove as any subjective assessment of (dis)utility: Perhaps the person entrusted with responsibility does not really perceive it as a burden, but as an honor, distinction, and mark of personal success – who knows or even can know? It further assumes that in the absence of such special compensation it would be either difficult to fill the position in question (because people shy away from responsible jobs unless there are special incentives) or that those who actually hold it would act less responsibly and become negligent in the performance of their task – both of which assumptions refer to counterfactuals which can at best be more or less plausible. Yet this latter proposition can only be stated (as the late Cohen [2008] argued) in the third-person perspective, not in that of the first person, i.e., a speaker speaking about herself. For that would mean to say: “In case I  were to be deprived of my responsibility bonus, I  would either desert my job or fail to perform it responsibly” – which is a proposition that plainly betrays a massive level of irresponsibility. Similarly and more generally, when beneficiaries of privileged status claim that conceding advantages to them will ultimately benefit the less privileged, they are not speaking about some causality in the world “out there”, but about themselves: The reason that this claim is “true” is that beneficiaries are in a position to effectively decide it must be true, using a kind of blackmail in order to make it true. Such claims and propositions fail what Cohen (2008) calls the “interpersonality test”: responsible action (in contrast to “effort”) is not something that one can consistently turn on and off, depending on the level of reward. Nor can one justify one's own <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>privilege</b> by threatening with one's own retaliatory power which will be deployed in case the claim is not honored.|$|E

40|$|During {{the sixteenth}} and seventeenth centuries tens of {{thousands}} of Castilians initiated lawsuits at the royal appellate courts to gain recognition of the status of hidalgo and enjoyment of legal privileges associated with this status. Appealing to a diversity of laws and customs these litigants claimed that the status of hidalgo provided such privileges as exemption from taxation, freedom from judicial torture, right to public office, and immunity from debtor's prison. Historians frequently characterize pre-modern European society as one in which the ruling classes enjoyed legal privileges {{on the basis of their}} social status or estate. Nevertheless in these contests the success or failure of litigants did not depend on the individual's ancestry or the objective application of existing laws governing privilege and status. In Early Modern Castile litigants intensely disputed one another's <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> and about <b>privilege,</b> and their respective definitions of status. Sources from the period reveal that royal and municipal authorities granted and recognized possession of legal privileges based on status. Paradoxically these authorities frequently denied the status of these same individuals and resisted their <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>privilege.</b> In this dissertation I analyze disputes over privilege as a means for understanding how legal inequality actually functioned in Early Modern Castile. The responses of monarchs, royal officials, and municipal councils <b>to</b> <b>claims</b> concerning <b>privilege</b> (at times in the form of judicial rulings) reflected contingent factors typically shaped by their own immediate interests. Consequently both claimants <b>to</b> <b>privilege</b> and the opposing sides in these cases used available rules and procedures as resources to advance their respective causes...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{provides}} a critical survey of certain methodological {{debates in the}} field of legal philosophy in order to assess their implications for legal research in general. Underpinning this survey is a concern to establish the independence and integrity of both legal practice and legal research {{in the light of the}} risks posed by preponderant forms of instrumental rationality. Thus, Brian Leiter's recent call for a ?naturalised? jurisprudence is criticised for the instrumentalist basis upon which he <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>privilege</b> forms of legal research apparently ?continuous with? the natural and empirical social sciences. As against Leiter, it is argued that there are in fact a range of distinct but interrelated modes of legal research. In this respect, the work of HLA Hart is interpreted as an example of a distinctively theoretical mode of inquiry into law. In addition, an account of the nature of a distinctively practical mode of legal inquiry is developed from a critique of Ronald Dworkin's excessively ?theoretical? reading of the interpretive character of legal practice. A constitutive practical feature of both modes of inquiry is their capacity to take up a certain distance from any exclusive concern with instrumental or pragmatic action. Peer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Richard E. Friedman {{writes that}} since Cush is {{generally}} understood to mean “Ethiopia”, {{it is possible}} that the “Cushite woman” is not Tzipora. But he adds that since there is a place called Cushan which is a region of Midian, and Moses’ wife Tzipora has already been identified as a Midianite, {{it is possible that}} the term “Cushite” relates to Tzipora’s being from Cushan. However, Friedman’s primary interest is not in the identity of the Cushite woman, but rather in the outcome of this story which establishes Moses’ superiority over Aaron as an example of his claim that rival priesthoods created or publicized tales in order to legitimize their respective <b>claims</b> <b>to</b> <b>privilege</b> and power. He describes the Aaronid priesthood in the Kingdom of Judah, which claimed descent from Aaron and which controlled the Temple in Jerusalem, as opposed to a priesthood which <b>claimed</b> allegiance <b>to</b> Moses and was based at Shiloh in the Kingdom of Israel. Using interpretations from the documentary hypothesis, he notes that this story, which he calls “Snow-White Miriam”, was authored by the Elohist who he claims was from, or supported, the Shiloh priesthood, and thus promoted this tale to assert Moses’ superiority over Aaron and thereby belittle the Aaronid priesthood in Judah. However, the identity of the Cushite woman referred to in this story is tangential to Friedman and his opinion remains inconclusive.|$|R
