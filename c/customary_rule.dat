The kingdom of Alba was too new to {{be said to have}} a <b>customary</b> <b>rule</b> of succession, but Pictish and Irish {{precedents}} favoured an adult successor descended from Kenneth MacAlpin. Constantine's surviving son Indulf, probably baptised in 927, would have been too young to be a serious candidate for the kingship in the early 940s, and the obvious heir was Constantine's nephew, MalcolmI. As Malcolm was born no later than 901, by the 940s he was no longer a young man, and may have been impatient. Willingly or not—the 11th-century Prophecy of Berchán, a verse history {{in the form of a}} supposed prophecy, states that it was not a voluntary decision—Constantine abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to Malcolm.|$|E

50|$|The {{question}} {{that had to}} be considered was whether this rule of succession unfairly discriminated between persons on grounds of sex or gender, and was in conflict with the provisions of section 8 of the Interim Constitution. It was common cause that, in rural areas where this <b>customary</b> <b>rule</b> most frequently found its application, the devolution of the deceased's property unto the male heir involved a concomitant duty of support and protection of the woman or women to whom he was married by customary law, and of the children procreated under that system and belonging to a particular house. A widow in particular might remain at the deceased's homestead and continue to use the estate property, and the heir could not eject her at his whim.|$|E
50|$|There are, {{the court}} noted, other {{instances}} where a rule differentiates {{between men and}} women, but which no right-minded person considers to be unfairly discriminatory: for example, the provision of separate toilet facilities. It followed that, even if this rule of succession were prima facie discriminatory {{on the grounds of}} sex or gender, and the presumption contained in section 8(4) of the Interim Constitution were to come into operation, this presumption had been refuted by the concomitant duty of support. The rights conferred by this <b>customary</b> <b>rule</b> were not inconsistent with the fundamental rights contained in chapter 3 of the Interim Constitution and the injunction found in section 33(3) could accordingly be implemented: namely, to construe the chapter {{in such a way as}} not to negate those rights.|$|E

5000|$|This logical {{framework}} {{makes sense for}} existing norms of customary international law, but it becomes problematic {{in the context of}} new or emerging customary rules. If a practice is not currently governed by customary international law, then it is illogical to inquire into a state's beliefs about the legality of engaging in or abstaining from that practice, i.e., to ask whether it believed that its practice was in compliance with a law that does not yet exist. This paradox may be resolved to some extent by the idea of [...] "crystallization" [...] of customary international law, in which practice and legal obligation evolve jointly and eventually ripen into law. Under one model, this process occurs in three stages: first, some States engage in a given practice for reasons other than a sense of legal obligation (e.g. political expediency, economic gain, courtesy, etc.); next, States reinforce the practice by engaging in it or making claims based upon it, creating loops of reciprocity and reliance based on expectations that the practice will continue; finally, as these relationships expand in number and complexity, they eventually harden into a general rule. In this final stage, as more States become aware of the conduct and actively participate or at least passively acquiesce to the practice, the States' actions begin to be undergirded by a belief that they are complying with an emerging <b>customary</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Because {{opinio juris}} {{refers to the}} {{psychological}} {{state of the state}} actor—asking why the state behaved as it did—it can be difficult to identify and to prove. In practice, a variety of sources tend to be used to demonstrate the existence of opinio juris, including evidence such as diplomatic correspondence, press releases and other government statements of policy, opinions of legal advisers, official manuals on legal questions, legislation, national and international judicial decisions, legal briefs endorsed by the state, a pattern of treaties ratified by the state that all include the same obligation(s), resolutions and declarations by the United Nations, and other sources. In the Paquete Habana case (decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1900 {{on the question of whether}} small coastal fishing boats are immune from capture during wartime under customary international law), evidence of opinio juris included medieval English royal ordinances, agreements between European nations, orders issued to the U.S. Navy in earlier conflicts, and the opinions of legal treatise writers. Finally, the context, circumstances, and manner in which the state practice is carried out can also be used to infer the existence of opinio juris. As the ICJ stated in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases of 1969, [...] "Not only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it." [...] Nonetheless, a state's motives can change over time, and that it is not necessary that opinio juris be a significant impetus for each instance of action. As Judge Lachs wrote in a dissenting opinion in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases, [...] "At successive stages in the development of the <b>customary</b> <b>rule</b> the motives which have prompted States to accept it have varied from case to case. It could not be otherwise. At all events, to postulate that all States, even those which initiate a given practice, believe themselves to be acting under a legal obligation is to resort to a fiction, and in fact to deny the possibility of developing such rules." ...|$|E
