25|$|Characteristically these boats had bluff bows, crew's {{quarters}} with {{table and}} <b>cooking</b> <b>stove</b> in the focsle, {{and a single}} mast with derrick {{in front of the}} large hold, aft of which the funnel and ship's wheel stood above the engine room while the captain had a small cabin in the stern. When publication of the Vital Spark stories began in 1905 the ship's wheel was still in the open, but later a wheelhouse was added aft of the funnel giving the puffers their distinctive image. Their flat bottom allowed them to beach and unload at low tide, essential to supply remote settlements without suitable piers. Typical cargoes could include coal and furniture, with farm produce and gravel sometimes being brought back.|$|E
25|$|The three {{houses in}} the The Louis G. Redstone Residential District are {{situated}} in a contiguous row on Appoline Street. All three are two-story, structures of reclaimed red brick, built in the International Style. The houses feature curved walls, low hip roofs, and steel casement and glass block windows. Each house has an attached single-car garage. The houses are tightly spaced, with a uniform setback, and the common backyard is enclosed with a red brick perimeter wall with no intermediate dividing walls. Benches and cantilevered stone shelves are incorporated Into the wall, as is a large outdoor grille and <b>cooking</b> <b>stove.</b> In {{the center of the}} backyard is a small concrete wading pool featuring two stylized snail sculptures, one {{at each end of the}} pool.|$|E
25|$|The {{offices on}} the second floor {{generally}} have been modernized with acoustical tile ceilings, fluorescent fixtures and vinyl floors. The old exterior doors remain, generally with glass replacing the shuttered sections, except for several windows on the rear lavatories and kitchen. Air conditioners are mounted in the transoms over the doors. On the southeast corner is a large inspector's office, with a counter for public business. Some old masonry partitions had been removed or altered to create this space. Along the east side, small rooms have been partitioned off and in the rear northeast corner is the large Port Director's office, in its original configuration. Across the north rear are a men's lavatory, a women's lavatory and a kitchen, all with black and white floor tiles. The kitchen appears to be original to the building and has traces of the original masonry <b>cooking</b> <b>stove</b> and flue. The left rear north corner room now used for training is also floored in old black and white tiles.|$|E

500|$|The Westinghouse {{air brake}} was trialled on {{carriages}} in the 1880s and this became standard in 1891. As the Highland Railway used vacuum brakes, carriages {{used on the}} Aberdeen to Inverness were dual-fitted. The livery changed in the late 1890s, when the upper half was painted cream and the lower purple lake, with gold lining and lettering. Corridor carriages, [...] long on six wheels, lit with electric lamps using Stone's system and with both classes having access to a lavatory appeared in 1896. Bogie corridor carriages, [...] long and weighing [...] were built for the Aberdeen to Inverness express in 1898 with provision for vestibule connections. The Great North also had Royal Saloon carriage that, unusually for the Great North, was built with a clerestory roof. This was [...] long, lit by electric lamps and with steam heating, and divided into a first class compartment and an attendant's coupe, which was fitted with a <b>cooking</b> <b>stove.</b> Later, shorter six-wheeled and bogie compartment carriages were built for secondary services, and communication cords and steam heating were fitted {{in the early years}} of the twentieth century.

The cottages sleep up to five people in single and double bunks. Each cottage has wooden floors, a porch, electric heat, lights, and outlets. The cottages also have a picnic table and fire ring in the yard area. In addition to the more traditional cottages two Mongolian style yurts are available to rent.

Picnic tables and fire rings are in the yard area.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{outbreak}} of Minamata disease in Niigata Prefecture {{was discovered in}} a very similar way to the original outbreak in Kumamoto Prefecture. From the autumn of 1964 to the spring of 1965, cats living {{along the banks of}} the Agano River had been seen to go mad and die: [...] "...one cat ran into a small clay <b>cooking</b> <b>stove</b> containing burning charcoal. With the pupils of its eyes dilated, salivating, convulsing and uttering a strange cry, the cat breathed its last breath." [...] These strange symptoms eventually began to appear in people, too. Professor Tadao Tsubaki of Niigata University examined two patients in April and May 1965 and suspected Minamata disease. One patient's hair was found to have a mercury level of 390 ppm. On 31 May, he reported an {{outbreak of}} organic mercury poisoning in the Agano River basin to the prefectural government and made his findings public on 12 June.|$|E

40|$|Today {{more than}} 2. 7 billion people rely on biomass {{as their primary}} cooking fuel, with {{profound}} implications for the environment and people's well-being. Wood provision is often time-consuming and the emitted smoke has severe health effects - both burdens that afflict women in particular. The dissemination of Improved <b>Cooking</b> <b>Stoves</b> (ICS) is frequently considered an eff ective remedy for these problems. This paper evaluates the take-up of ICS and their impacts through a randomized controlled trial in rural Senegal. Although distributed for free, the ICS are used by almost 100 % of households. Furthermore, we find substantial effects on firewood consumption, eye infections, and respiratory disease symptoms. These findings substantiate the increasing efforts {{of the international community}} to improve access to improved <b>cooking</b> <b>stoves</b> and call for a more direct promotion of these stoves...|$|R

A neighbor of ours hid six cans of rifle powder in the bake-oven of an old discarded <b>cooking</b> <b>stove</b> which stood on the open ground near a frame out-house or shed, and from and after that day never thought of it again. We hired a half-tamed Indian to do some washing for us, and he took up quarters under the shed with his tub. The ancient stove reposed within six feet of him, and before his face. Finally it occurred to him that hot water would be better than cold, and he went out and fired up under that forgotten powder magazine and set on a kettle of water. Then he returned to his tub.|$|E
40|$|In many Sub-Saharan African countries, {{fuelwood}} {{collection is}} among the most important drivers of deforestation and particularly forest degradation. In a detailed field study in the Kafa region of southern Ethiopia, we assessed the potential of efficient <b>cooking</b> <b>stoves</b> to mitigate the negative impacts of fuelwood harvesting on forests. Eleven thousand improved <b>cooking</b> <b>stoves</b> (ICS), specifically designed for baking Ethiopia’s staple food injera, referred to locally as “Mirt” stoves, have been distributed here. We found a high acceptance rate of the stove. One hundred forty interviews, including users and non-users of the ICS, revealed fuelwood savings of nearly 40 % in injera preparation compared to the traditional three-stone fire, leading to a total annual savings of 1. 28 tons of fuelwood per household. Considering the approximated share of fuelwood from unsustainable sources, these savings translate to 11, 800 tons of CO 2 saved for 11, 156 disseminated ICS, corresponding to the amount of carbon stored in over 30 ha of local forest. We further found that stove efficiency increased with longer injera baking sessions, which shows a way of optimizing fuelwood savings by adapted usage of ICS. Our study confirms that efficient <b>cooking</b> <b>stoves,</b> if well adapted to the local cooking habits, can make a significant contribution to the conservation of forests and the avoidance of carbon emission from forest clearing and degradation...|$|R
