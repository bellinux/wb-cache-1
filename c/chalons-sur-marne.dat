5|$|Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, {{compiled}} in the Middle Ages {{are among}} the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine. The first cookbooks began to appear {{towards the end of the}} 13th century. The Liber de coquina, perhaps originating near Naples, and the Tractatus de modo preparandi have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at <b>Châlons-sur-Marne</b> has been edited by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat. Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might be today, as a step-by-step guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish. Few in a kitchen, at those times, would have been able to read, and working texts have a low survival rate.|$|E
25|$|General Beaufort d'Hautpoul was put {{in charge}} of the expeditionary force. d'Hautpoul was quite {{experienced}} and knowledgeable of matters in the Middle East, as he had served during the 1830s as chief of staff for Ibrahim Pasha in the Egyptian campaigns in Southern Syria. The French expeditionary corps of 6,000 soldiers, mainly from <b>Châlons-sur-Marne,</b> landed in Beyrouth on 16 August 1860.|$|E
25|$|In Troyes, the Allies {{went on a}} 2-day orgy of pillage and violence. After they {{recovered}} from this, Wittgenstein and Wrede headed out after the French while the Crown Prince and Gyulai advanced toward Sens. Schwarzenberg himself stayed in Troyes until 12 March. By 16 March the Allies had pushed MacDonald's army back to Provins. That day Schwarzenberg found out about Napoleon's victory at the Battle of Reims and the French capture of <b>Châlons-sur-Marne</b> and his advance stopped.|$|E
25|$|After {{three days}} of reorganization, Napoleon left Auguste de Marmont and Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise with 21,000 troops to watch Blücher while he tried to outflank Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg's main army by moving against Arcis-sur-Aube. Marshal Michel Ney marched {{southeast}} from Reims to recapture <b>Châlons-sur-Marne.</b> At this time, Schwarzenberg's army threatened to cross the Seine River and press back Marshal Jacques MacDonald's wing of the French army. News of Saint-Priest's rout reached Coalition headquarters on 16 March. This prompted the Austrian field marshal to make the intelligent decision to fall back and reassemble his army between Troyes and Arcis-sur-Aube.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon {{spent three}} days at Reims {{following}} his victory. With Blücher still recovering from sickness, Gneisenau did not trouble the French during that time. The French emperor sent Ney to seize <b>Châlons-sur-Marne,</b> which was done without opposition. Ney was joined by Jan Willem Janssens who gathered 3,000 men from the Ardennes garrisons. Meanwhile, Schwarzenberg's army advanced perilously close to Paris. Napoleon's problem was to lure the Allied army away from Paris. He decided to leave Marmont and Mortier with 21,000 soldiers to watch Blücher and move south toward Arcis-sur-Aube to threaten Schwarzenberg's supply line. The Battle of Arcis-sur-Aube was fought on 20–21 March 1814.|$|E
25|$|On 1 February 1814, Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher with 80,000 Allied {{troops from}} his own Army of Silesia and Austrian Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg's Army of Bohemia {{defeated}} Napoleon and 45,000 French soldiers in the Battle of La Rothière. This setback seriously shook the French army's morale. Each side suffered about 6,000 casualties but the Allied captured 50–60 artillery pieces. The Allies were delighted by their victory, though {{it might have been}} more complete if all their reserves had been committed to the battle. At this time, the Allied generals made the questionable decision to separate their armies. Blücher's army would advance from <b>Châlons-sur-Marne</b> toward Meaux while Schwarzenberg's army operated on a more southerly route from Troyes toward Paris.|$|E
25|$|Saint-Priest, a French émigré, led the Russian 8th Infantry Corps, {{which was}} made up of the 11th and 17th Infantry Divisions. Each {{division}} consisted of four line infantry and two jäger regiments. At the beginning of 1814, the corps numbered 11,900 soldiers and formed part of Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron's 43,000-strong army corps. On 31 December 1813, the 8th Corps executed a successful assault crossing of the Rhine River near Koblenz. After this operation the corps advanced to Dinant on the Meuse River. On 15 February, Saint-Priest's corps was ordered to take over the Siege of Mainz. By early March, Saint-Priest had moved west to occupy <b>Châlons-sur-Marne</b> and Vitry-le-François. Fresh from the blockade of Erfurt, Jagow brought his Prussian brigade to join Saint-Priest.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 Armstrong turned {{professional}} {{with the}} Motorola Cycling Team, the successor of 7-Eleven team. In 1993, Armstrong won 10 one-day events and stage races, but his breakthrough victory was the World Road Race Championship held in Norway. Before his World Championships win, {{he took his}} first win at the Tour de France, in the stage from <b>Châlons-sur-Marne</b> to Verdun. He was 97th in the general classification when he retired after stage 12. He collected the Thrift Drug Triple Crown of Cycling: the Thrift Drug Classic in Pittsburgh, the K-Mart West Virginia Classic, and the CoreStates USPRO national championship in Philadelphia. He is alleged by another cyclist competing in the CoreStates Road Race to have bribed that cyclist {{so that he would}} not compete with Armstrong for the win.|$|E
25|$|On 12 November 1813, Napoleon ordered Horace Sebastiani to take {{command of}} the V Corps and III Cavalry Corps and defend Koblenz. Sebastiani had only 4,500 troops to protect {{this part of the}} Rhine River. The Allied army of Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher {{successfully}} crossed the Rhine near Koblenz on 2 January 1814, rendering the French position untenable. On 13 January, Marshal Jacques MacDonald ordered Sebastiani to retreat to Aachen. By 26 January, MacDonald and Sebastiani and about 10,000 men were near Sainte-Menehould and marching toward <b>Châlons-sur-Marne,</b> which they reached on 30 January. On 5 February MacDonald was chased out of Châlons by Ludwig von Yorck's Prussians. In the next few days, Blücher tried to run down and destroy MacDonald's force, but the marshal managed to evade his pursuers by 9 February. In the unsuccessful effort to catch the French, Blücher allowed his army to become dangerously extended.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon {{spent three}} days resting his troops at Reims while Marshal Michel Ney reoccupied <b>Châlons-sur-Marne.</b> Ney was joined by a 3,000-man {{division}} that Jan Willem Janssens brought in from the Ardennes garrisons. The French emperor desired to move east to gather up other garrisons, but Schwarzenberg's offensive to the south compelled him to march in that direction. While Napoleon operated against Blücher in the north, the main Allied army pressed MacDonald back toward Paris. On 27 February, Schwarzenberg defeated Oudinot in the Battle of Bar-sur-Aube, forcing MacDonald to withdraw to the west. The Allies overpowered MacDonald on 3–4 March at the Battle of Laubressel. Schwarzenberg occupied Troyes but halted there until 12 March in a welter of indecision. Encouraged by news of Blucher's victory at Laon, the main Allied army crossed the Seine River and drove MacDonald beyond Provins by 16 March. Schwarzenberg's offensive came to a sudden halt when tidings of Napoleon's success at Reims arrived in the Allied camp.|$|E
25|$|Blücher's army finally lurched {{into motion}} on 18 March, with its {{commander}} wearing a lady's green silk hat {{in order to}} protect his inflamed eyes from the sun. On this day, Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg's corps compelled Étienne Pierre Sylvestre Ricard's division to abandon Berry-au-Bac though the French managed to destroy the bridge over the Aisne River. Marmont had overall command of the forces facing Blücher and his orders were to cover Paris and stop his foes from crossing the Aisne. Mortier was at Reims while Henri François Marie Charpentier's division held Soissons. Since Blücher had 109,000 troops while the French only mustered 13,000 infantry and 3,600 cavalry, it was plain that the Allies could not be stopped for long. In order to block the road to Paris and to rendezvous with Charpentier, Marmont fell back southwest toward Fismes and called in Mortier from Reims. He believed that Blücher wished to bring him to battle, but in fact the Prussian field marshal was heading for Reims and <b>Châlons-sur-Marne</b> to link up with Schwarzenberg.|$|E
25|$|On 1 February 1814, Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher {{commanding}} 80,000 Allied {{soldiers from}} his own Army of Silesia and Austrian Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg's Army of Bohemia defeated Napoleon with 45,000 French troops in the Battle of La Rothière. Elated by their triumph, the Allied commanders devised a new plan whereby Schwarzenberg advanced from Troyes toward Paris while Blücher operated on a more northerly axis from <b>Châlons-sur-Marne</b> toward Meaux. The two armies would be linked by Peter Wittgenstein's corps and a scouting force led by Alexander Nikitich Seslavin. Within a few days the cautious Schwarzenberg began pulling Wittgenstein's troops to the south. Believing the war was almost over, the Blücher pressed rapidly west after a smaller French force under Marshal Jacques MacDonald. Unknown to the Prussian field marshal, on 5 February Schwarzenberg switched Seslavin's force from the right flank to the extreme left flank without informing Blücher. Since he lacked a liaison officer with Seslavin, the Prussian was unaware that a dangerous gap yawned on his left flank.|$|E
25|$|After {{looking at}} the {{captured}} messages, Czar Alexander I of Russia at his headquarters at Sompuis concluded that the Allied armies should advance on Paris. He asked Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, Hans Karl von Diebitsch and Karl Wilhelm von Toll for their advice. Barclay wished to follow Napoleon but Toll wanted to move on Paris while sending 10,000 cavalry to hide the maneuver from Napoleon. After Diebitsch came around to Toll and Alexander's point of view, they convinced first King Frederick William III of Prussia and then Schwarzenberg of their plan. On 24 March, Schwarzenberg's army moved north toward Vitry-le-François, but new orders were issued for the following day. Wintzingerode was instructed to chase after Napoleon with his cavalry force. The VI Corps supported by the IV Corps were ordered to march west toward Fère-Champenoise with their combined cavalry in front. The Guards and Reserves were directed on the same place from Sompuis while the III Corps was to move north from Mailly-le-Camp. Vorontsov, Langeron and Sacken of Blücher's army were instructed to move west from <b>Châlons-sur-Marne</b> toward Étoges. By the evening of 24 March, Schwarzenberg's host was near Vitry, on the east bank of the Coole (Côle) River.|$|E
25|$|The {{roots of}} the modern Champagne {{industry}} were laid during the Industrial Revolution which saw vast leaps in understanding the method of making sparkling wine and improvements in the technology needed to make production more financially feasible. The French scientist Jean-Antoine Chaptal popularized the understanding that Champagne sparkled because it was sealed in a bottle before fermentation was complete. He further noted {{that it was the}} sugar in the wine that facilitated this fermentation process resulting in bubbles. Along with the bubbles came intense pressure from the carbon dioxide gas that could result in the bottles exploding. The disturbance caused by one bottle's disintegration could cause a chain reaction, with it being routine for cellars to lose 20–90% of their bottles to instability. The British method of coal fired glassmaking contributed to stronger wine bottles being available that could withstand the pressure of the carbon dioxide gas better. In the 1830s, a pharmacist from <b>Châlons-sur-Marne</b> named André François outlined formulas with precise measurements of how much sugar is needed to make a wine sparkle without producing more pressure than the wine bottle could withstand. Corking machines and improved corks made sealing the wine easier with less opportunity for the precious gas to seep out of the bottle.|$|E
25|$|Blücher {{assigned}} {{only the}} corps of Yorck and Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf to follow Marmont. By 19 March, Blucher had established two bridges over the Aisne and sent Ferdinand von Wintzingerode's corps south to capture Reims. Wintzingerode occupied Reims at daybreak on 20 March after it was evacuated by Augustin Daniel Belliard who led Mortier's cavalry. At this hour, Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron's Russian corps was at Berry-au-Bac while Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken's Russian corps was nearby at Pontavert. Blücher ordered Wintzingerode to hold Reims with his infantry and send his cavalry to Épernay and Vitry-le-François. Charpentier left a 2,800-man garrison in Soissons before pulling out to join Marmont and Mortier. On 21 March, there was a cavalry scuffle at Oulchy-le-Château between Yorck and Kleist's cavalry and the French, but the Prussians did not pursue. Having picked up Charpentier's division, Marmont and Mortier crossed the Marne at Château-Thierry and destroyed the bridge. Also on the 21st, Marmont received a dispatch from Napoleon rebuking him for not retreating from Reims toward <b>Châlons-sur-Marne</b> and ordering him to move back in that direction. On 22 March, the two marshals headed east toward Étoges. That day Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow's Prussian corps appeared before Soissons and began bombarding the place.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 1814, III Cavalry Corps of Jean-Toussaint Arrighi de Casanova {{consisted}} of a light cavalry division led by Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge and a heavy cavalry division under Charles Claude Jacquinot. Lorge's division {{was made up of}} the 5th, 10th, 13th, 15th, 21st, 22nd and 29th Chasseurs à Cheval and the 2nd, 4th and 12th Hussar Regiments. Jacquinot's division included the 13th Cuirassier and the 4th, 5th, 12th, 16th, 17th, 21st, 24th, 26th and 27th Dragoon Regiments. The two divisions were supported by four 6-pound cannons and two howitzers of the 5th Company of the 1st Horse Artillery Regiment and the 2nd Company of the 1st Principal Train Battalion. While many units had under 100 cavalrymen, the largest unit was the 303-strong 13th Chasseurs and the weakest was the 16-man 4th Hussars. On 25 January 1814, when the bulk of the field army assembled at <b>Châlons-sur-Marne,</b> the III Cavalry Corps was reorganized into a light cavalry division under Auguste Jean Ameil and a heavy cavalry division led by Jacquinot. Ameil's division had 201 sabers in the 1st Provisional Hussar Regiment and 842 in the 2nd Provisional Chasseur Regiment while Jacquinot counted 740 horsemen in the 3rd Provisional Dragoons and 72 in the 4th Provisional Cuirassiers.|$|E

2500|$|At 11:00 pm, Mortier {{notified}} Napoleon of {{his plans}} to retreat to Vendeuvre-sur-Barse and immediately sent orders for his troops to begin evacuating Bar-sur-Aube. The march discipline of the [...] Imperial Guard was so good that the Allies were unaware of their departure until the next morning. Gyulai's corps did not begin the pursuit until the afternoon then it quickly halted at the broken bridge at Spoy. Gyulai mistakenly reported that the French retreated to <b>Châlons-sur-Marne</b> when Mortier was heading for Troyes. The Crown Prince's troops halted and bivouacked in the area. After interrogating his prisoners, Mortier concluded that the Crown Prince's corps numbered 12,000–15,000 men while Gyulai had 30,000. He reported to the emperor that the Allies employed 60 artillery pieces against him including heavy 12-pounder batteries. On 26 January, Napoleon arrived at <b>Châlons-sur-Marne</b> and the Battle of Brienne was fought on 29 January 1814.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 March 1792 Beauregard was {{promoted}} to general of brigade. After an assignment at Avignon he was given command of the 2nd Military Division at <b>Châlons-sur-Marne</b> on 1 October 1792. One source described the troops at Châlons as an [...] "unruly mob". Except for one battalion of regulars the force was entirely made up of volunteers. Its commander was Alexandre Séraphin Joseph Magnus de Sparre who was unable to instill any discipline in this body of soldiers. On 28 February 1793, Beauregard replaced Sparre in command at Châlons. On 8 April {{he was sent to}} command troops at Sedan. He was elevated in rank to general of division in the Army of the Ardennes on 15 May 1793.|$|E

2500|$|By mid-January, the French forces under Marshal Jacques MacDonald, which {{included}} III Cavalry Corps, were in full retreat through Namur {{and headed for}} an intended rendezvous with Napoleon at <b>Châlons-sur-Marne.</b> After detaching garrisons, MacDonald's command numbered no more than 11,000 men. From Châlons, MacDonald's force was chased to the west by the Army of Silesia. Around this time, Napoleon reorganized his cavalry into four corps plus an independent division and the III Cavalry Corps was suppressed. Jacquinot was placed {{in command of the}} two-brigade 4th Light Cavalry Division in the new VI Cavalry Corps under François Étienne de Kellermann. Auguste Jean Ameil's 979-strong 7th Brigade included six regiments of chasseurs à cheval while Wolff's 686-man 8th Brigade comprised three hussar, one chevau-léger lancer and two chasseurs à cheval regiments.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} 12 days, the unit {{made its way}} first west, and then {{southwest}} across France. [...] Initially they {{kept in touch with}} the French 4th army, hoping to set up their hospital and carry out the humanitarian task which had brought them. But this was not to be. [...] The pace of the French collapse quickened; they were never more than two nights in any one place. It was only at <b>Châlons-sur-Marne</b> that a party of six French orderlies and a French nurse was briefly detached to a hospital to help its overwhelmed medical staff. The roads were choked with refugees, petrol was hard to find and they went off the edge of their road maps. [...] While queuing to refuel at the barracks in Gannat, between Moulins and Clermont-Ferrand, they heard that Marshal Philippe Pétain had asked the Germans for an armistice.|$|E
2500|$|In 1814, Reims had a {{population}} of 30,000 {{and was one of}} the most important cities of France. The city was surrounded by a wall and the Vesle River flowed through the city from southeast to northwest. The Soissons suburb was on an island to the southwest, opposite the city. Reims was [...] north of <b>Châlons-sur-Marne</b> and [...] east of Soissons. Napoleon was aware that Reims was in grave danger but he could only spare the Honor Guards cavalry division under Jean-Marie Defrance to watch the crossings of the Aisne River. The city's garrison was commanded by Jean Corbineau and was made up of 4,000 National Guards, a handful of line infantry and eight artillery pieces. Another authority asserted that the French garrison numbered only 1,256 infantry and 150 cavalry. These included details from the 15th, 43rd, 50th, 66th and 138th Line Infantry, 1st and 3rd Gardes d'Honneur, 2nd Eclaireurs and Guard artillery.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 January 1814 {{when the}} French army {{assembled}} at <b>Châlons-sur-Marne,</b> Pelet commanded a brigade in Decouz's 2nd Young Guard Division in Ney's corps. There were 680 {{soldiers in the}} 5th Voltiguer Regiment and 633 men in the 6th Voltiguers. After Decouz was killed at the Battle of Brienne on 29 January, Pelet became acting commander of the division. He led the division in the Battle of La Rothière on 1 February, the Battle of Champaubert on 10 February and the Battle of Montmirail on 11 February. He was reassigned to lead a brigade in Louis Friant's Old Guard Division on 14 February. At La Rothière the division counted 1,800 men, while at Champaubert there were 2,840 soldiers present for duty. Philibert Jean-Baptiste Curial was the official commander of the 2nd Young Guard Division during this time. Pelet fought at the battles of Vauchamps and Montereau in February and at Craonne, Laon, Reims and Arcis-sur-Aube in March.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} part of the 1920s GQG was to be {{established}} at the army headquarters of the Metz region, sited in accordance with the contemporary French plans in case of war with Germany. [...] French war plans at the time called for a quick offensive strike to occupy the Rhineland for which Metz was well suited. [...] The site was changed to <b>Chalons-sur-Marne</b> in the later 1920s, reflecting a change in French war plans from the offensive to the defensive. [...] This however, proved susceptible to aerial attack and GQG was switched to Vertus, [...] west of Chalons. [...] Virtus' small towns provided the potential to disperse GQG in different locations and the extensive wine cellars could be transformed into air raid shelters. [...] However the site was still considered insufficient in regards to defence against aerial attack and so in March 1935 the site of La Ferté-sous-Jouarre was chosen.

2500|$|In 1888, the French {{began to}} study a {{possible}} German offensive north of Verdun or through Belgium and Plan XII was written with a contingency for a German breach of Belgian neutrality. In 1904, this was given more attention after a German (Le vengeur [...] ) sold {{a copy of the}} German concentration plan to French intelligence and described mobilisation methods and war plans. Using this windfall and other sources of information, the French adapted Plan XV of 1906, to be ready for a German invasion of Belgium and later plans contained increases in the forces to be assembled to the north and north-east of Verdun. Plan XVI of March 1909, anticipated a German enveloping manoeuvre through Luxembourg and Belgium, after the findings of a 1908 analysis by General Henri de Lacroix, in which he dwelt on the German preference for enveloping manoeuvres and predicted that two German armies would march through eastern Belgium, around the northern flank of the French fortress zone, one to emerge from the Ardennes at Verdun and the other at Sedan. Lacroix wanted to improve the prospects of the usual defensive-offensive strategy by assembling a new Sixth Army near <b>Châlons-sur-Marne,</b> (now Châlons-en-Champagne), [...] west of Verdun, easily to move towards Toul in the centre, Verdun on the left or to the vicinity of Sedan and Mézières behind the northern flank.|$|E

At <b>Châlons-sur-Marne</b> he had likewise been placed in great danger by treachery. The Count de Châlons had invited him to a tournament, and he had accepted, contrary to the advice of the Pope, who warned him of evil designs; but he declared that no king ever refused such a challenge, and arrived at Châlons with a gallant following. The Pope's suspicions were verified; the Count, after breaking a lance with the King, made a sudden, unchivalrous attack on him, throwing his arms round his body, and striving to hurl him from the saddle; but Edward sat firm as a rock, and, touching his horse with his spur, caused it to bound forward, dragging the Count to the ground, where he lay, encumbered with his heavy armor; and Edward, after harmlessly ringing on the steel with his sword, forced him to surrender to an archer, as one unworthy to be reckoned a knight. A fight had, in the meantime, taken place between the attendants on either side, and so many of the men of the French party were killed, that the fray was termed the Little Battle of Châlons.|$|E

The new republican reign was a reign of mercy, except for the tail of Robespierre, as the phrase ran then. Every {{man who had been}} so wicked or so unfortunate as to be involved, even in the meanest capacity, with the machinery of the government of Terror, was threatened, and justly, with the fate of Robespierre. I, among others, fell under this menace of death. I deserved to die, and should have resigned myself to the guillotine but for you. From the course taken by public events, I knew you would be saved; and although your safety was the work of circumstances, still I had a hand in rendering it possible at the outset; and a yearning came over me to behold you both free again with my own eyes--a selfish yearning to see in you a living, breathing, real result of the one good impulse of my heart, which I could look back on with satisfaction. This desire gave me a new interest in life. I resolved to escape death if it were possible. For ten days I lay hidden in Paris. After that--thanks to certain scraps of useful knowledge which my experience in the office of secret police had given me--I succeeded in getting clear of Paris and in making my way safely to Switzerland. The rest of my story is so short and so soon told that I may as well get it over at once. The only relation I knew of in the world to apply to was a cousin of mine (whom I had never seen before), established as a silk-mercer at Berne. I threw myself on this man's mercy. He discovered that I was likely, with my business habits, to be of some use to him, and he took me into his house. I worked for what he pleased to give me, traveled about for him in Switzerland, deserved his confidence, and won it. Till within the last few months I remained with him; and only left my employment to enter, by my master's own desire, the house of his brother, established also as a silk-mercer, at <b>Chalons-sur-Marne.</b> In the counting-house of this merchant I am corresponding clerk, and am only able to come and see you now by offering to undertake a special business mission for my employer at Paris.

I am not obliged to cringe for every crown-piece I put in my pocket--not bound to denounce, deceive, and dog to death other men, before I can earn my bread, and scrape together money enough to bury me. I am ending a bad, base life harmlessly at last. It is a poor thing to do, but it is something done--and even that contents a man at my age.
