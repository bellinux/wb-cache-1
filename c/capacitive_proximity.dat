One application considered here is interactive dance, in which a choreographer wishes to translate the movements of multiple dancers into real-time audio or video content to accompany the performance.

Interest in using both inductive and <b>capacitive</b> arrays for <b>proximity</b> sensing, surface feature characterization, material properties evaluation, and flaw detecting has increased steadily since the mid- 1980 ’s [1 – 7].

While systems for home automa-tion and control exist, there are few systems that interact with in-dividuals suffering from paralysis, paresis, weakness and limited range of motion that are common sequels resulting from severe injuries such as stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury and many chronic (guillian barre syndrome) and degenerative (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) conditions. To address this problem, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Inviz, a low-cost gesture recognition system for paralysis patients that uses flexible textile-based capacitive sensor arrays for movement detection. The design of Inviz presents two novel research contributions. First, the system uses flexible textile-based <b>capacitive</b> arrays as <b>proximity</b> sensors that are minimally obtrusive and can be built into clothing for gesture and movement detection in patients with limited body motion. The proximity sensing obviates the need for touch-based gesture recognition that can cause skin abrasion in paralysis patients, and the array of capacitive sensors help provide better spatial resolution and noise cancellation. Second, Inviz uses a low-power hierarchical signal processing algorithm that breaks down computation into multiple low and high power tiers. The tiered approach provides maximal vigilance at minimal energy consumption. We have designed and implemented a fully functional prototype of Inviz and we evaluate {{it in the context}} of an end-to-end home automation system and show that it achieves high accuracy while maintaining low latency and low energy consumption.

40|$|Smart environments {{feature a}} number of {{computing}} and sensing devices that support occupants in performing their tasks. In the last decades {{there has been a}} multitude of advances in miniaturizing sensors and computers, while greatly increasing their performance. As a result new devices are introduced into our daily lives that have a plethora of functions. Gathering information about the occupants is fundamental in adapting the smart environment according to preference and situation. There is a large number of different sensing devices available that can provide information about the user. They include cameras, accelerometers, GPS, acoustic systems, or capacitive sensors. The latter use the properties of an electric field to sense presence and properties of conductive objects within range. They are commonly employed in finger-controlled touch screens that are present in billions of devices. A less common variety is the <b>capacitive</b> <b>proximity</b> sensor. It can detect the presence of the human body over a distance, providing interesting applications in smart environments. Choosing the right sensor technology is an important decision in designing a smart environment application. Apart from looking at previous use cases, this process can be supported by providing more formal methods. In this work I present a benchmarking model that is designed to support this decision process for applications in smart environments. Previous benchmarks for pervasive systems have been adapted towards sensors systems and include metrics that are specific for smart environments. Based on distinct sensor characteristics, different ratings are used as weighting factors in calculating a benchmarking score. The method is verified using popularity matching in two scientific databases. Additionally, there are extensions to cope with central tendency bias and normalization with regards to average feature rating. Four relevant application areas are identified by applying this benchmark to applications in smart environments and <b>capacitive</b> <b>proximity</b> sensors. They are indoor localization, smart appliances, physiological sensing and gesture interaction. Any application area has a set of challenges regarding the required sensor technology, layout of the systems, and processing that can be tackled using various new or improved methods. I will present a collection of existing and novel methods that support processing data generated by <b>capacitive</b> <b>proximity</b> sensors. These are in the areas of sparsely distributed sensors, model-driven fitting methods, heterogeneous sensor systems, image-based processing and physiological signal processing.

40|$|In recent years, <b>capacitive</b> <b>proximity</b> sensing made {{significant}} {{advances in the}} field of gathering implicit contextual data. These systems find broad usage in pervasive activity-recognition systems, installed stationary or made portable. In the domain of context recognition new ways of interaction with the environment opened up since conductive objects can be detected under certain conditions at distances up to 50 cm. This master's thesis investigates an approach to recognize lying positions using <b>capacitive</b> <b>proximity</b> sensing. The overall goal is to develop a technological concept that can be applied to recognize lying postures of patients in elderly homes. Using this contextual data may lead to many desired benefits in elderly care. For example, the occurrence of Decubitus, a condition caused by prolonged pressure on the skin resulting in injuries to skin and underlying tissues, can be avoided better by knowing how the patient is bedded. In order to achieve a desired high resolution, the multiple access schemes CDMA and FDMA are investigated as a basis for <b>capacitive</b> <b>proximity</b> measurements. For this purpose CDMA has been implemented using Gold Codes while the correlation serves the purpose of a measure. In a test setup measurements for CDMA and FDMA have been conducted. They lead to the conclusion that at close distances FDMA has a slightly better spatial resolution than CDMA but as the distance increases the spatial resolution of FDMA will be twice as high as the one of CDMA. The real-world setup achieves a resolution of 48 measurement points, by applying a low-cost grid of crossed wires under the slatted frame of a bed. The experimental results show that the presented approach and the decisions derived from the evaluation of multiple access schemes lead to a well-suitable system for recognizing lying postures...|$|E
40|$|This work's general {{topic is}} {{advanced}} driver assistance systems. In particular, it's about the assisted driver seat adjustment in dependence on anthropometric data, {{the detection of}} Out-of-Position postures and the driver drowsiness detection. Already existing systems use sensors like in- and off-cabin cameras to detect drowsiness or require the manual input of anthropometric data to adjust the driver's seat. Contrary to these system's approaches, {{the aim of this}} work is to build a system which captures drowsiness symptoms, tracks the head position and captures anthropometric data only by the use of invisible seat integrated <b>capacitive</b> <b>proximity</b> sensors. Still, the aim includes the evaluation of the system's concepts to give direction for further examinations. The idea is the integration of several <b>capacitive</b> <b>proximity</b> sensors at meaningful positions into a driver's seat. Owing {{to the fact that the}}se sensors can sense through non-conductive materials, the sensors can be installed invisible under the seat cover. Furthermore, the sensors measure changes in the electric field. Occupants, which are in range of the sensors, change the electric field. Therefore, the sensor values shall give information about the occupant's anthropometry and position. With these anthropometric data, an assisted seat adjustment shall be possible. Especially the movement of the driver's head could give information about the driver's drowsiness. A first question of this report addresses the driver's anthropometry. What's a proper seat adjustment? Furthermore, what are the symptoms for drowsiness and which could be measured with <b>capacitive</b> <b>proximity</b> sensors? Moreover, what is an Out-of-Position posture? With information about the anthropometrical requirements, the work shows which concepts can meet the demands on the system. Owing to the fact that the system needs evaluation, how shall a prototype be developed with reference to the concepts? Due to the results of the evaluation, the concepts can satisfy the demands on the system. The ideas which rely on machine learning classifiers result in reliable data. Nevertheless, the different approaches show different demands on the collected data's diversity, which is used to train the algorithms. Besides the machine learning classifiers, many functions of the assisted seat adjustment depend on generic relations between the prototype's sensor system and the occupant's anthropometry. These functions show positive results. Nevertheless, a multiclass SVM approach with discrete adjustment classification could lead to better results, because this approach can include more sensors. Therefore, further obedience between the sensors' data and the anthropometry could be included. Several functions of advanced driver assistance systems are integrated into the <b>capacitive</b> <b>proximity</b> sensing supported advanced driver assistance system. The evaluation shows that invisibly seat integrated <b>capacitive</b> <b>proximity</b> sensors can sense several symptoms of driver drowsiness. Furthermore, the system can assist the driver's seat adjustment and detect "Out-of-Position" postures. The detection concepts are constrained by several requirements for a proper working system. Consequently, the next step is a further integration of the system into a real car. Supplementary, the evaluation shows that the machine learning concepts require a plenty of miscellaneous data. Hence, a further data collection will improve the systems creditableness. Besides the further data collection and real system integration, the developed prototype can be the basis for a further function development, like the gesture recognition for the control of a multimedia system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — All mammals but humans use {{whiskers}} {{in order}} to rapidly acquire information about objects {{in the vicinity of}} the head. Collisions of the head and objects can be avoided as the contact point is moved from the body surface to the whiskers.

Using novel <b>capacitive</b> <b>proximity</b> sensors, robots sense when they approach a human (or an object) and react before they actually collide with it. We propose a sensor and control concept that mimics the behavior of whiskers by means of capacitive sensors. Major advantages are the absence of physical whiskers, the absence of blind spots and a very short response time. The sensors are flexible and thin so that they feature skin-like properties and can be attached to various robotic link and joint shapes.
