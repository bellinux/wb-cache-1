5|$|The {{production}} of whiskey {{was certainly not}} a norm in the <b>colonies</b> <b>in</b> the early years. The upper echelon of colonial society looked down upon American whiskey up until {{the time of the}} American Revolution. Some even saw the harsh spirit as a bastion of debauchery in the American colonies. Whatever the sentiment, the Scottish, Irish, and Germans brought a taste for hard spirits from their homelands to the American <b>colonies</b> <b>in</b> the 1730s. These groups continued to produce hard spirits in imported stills, or stills based on Old World designs, in retaliation against the English economic controls.|$|E

5|$|Canadian {{culture has}} {{historically}} been influenced by Indigenous, French and British cultures and traditions. Most of Canada's territory was inhabited and developed later than other European <b>colonies</b> <b>in</b> the Americas, {{with the result that}} themes and symbols of pioneers, trappers, and traders were important in the early development of the Canadian identity. First Nations played a critical part in the development of European <b>colonies</b> <b>in</b> Canada, particularly for their role in assisting exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The British conquest of New France in the mid-1700s brought a large Francophone population under British Imperial rule, creating a need for compromise and accommodation. The new British rulers left alone much of the religious, political, and social culture of the French-speaking habitants, guaranteeing through the Quebec Act of 1774 the right of the Canadiens to practise the Catholic faith and to use French civil law (now Quebec law).|$|E

5|$|The British Parliament's {{efforts to}} levy new taxes {{following}} the French and Indian War were deeply unpopular in the <b>colonies.</b> <b>In</b> the House of Burgesses, opposition to {{taxation without representation}} was led by Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, among others. Virginians began to coordinate their actions with other <b>colonies</b> <b>in</b> 1773, and sent delegates to the Continental Congress the following year. After the House of Burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774, Virginia's revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the Virginia Conventions. On May 15, 1776, the Convention declared Virginia's independence from the British Empire and adopted George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was then included in a new constitution. Another Virginian, Thomas Jefferson, drew upon Mason's work in drafting the national Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|The British {{conquest of}} New France {{was preceded by}} {{a small number of}} Germans and Swedes who settled {{alongside}} the Scottish in Port Royal, Nova Scotia, while some Irish immigrated to the Colony of Newfoundland. In the wake of the British Conquest of 1760 and the Expulsion of the Acadians, many families from the British <b>colonies</b> <b>in</b> New England moved over into Nova Scotia and other <b>colonies</b> <b>in</b> Canada, where the British made farmland available to British settlers on easy terms. More settlers arrived during and after the American Revolutionary War, when approximately 60,000 United Empire Loyalists fled to British North America, a large portion of whom settled in New Brunswick. After the War of 1812, British (including British army regulars), Scottish and Irish immigration was encouraged throughout Rupert's Land, Upper Canada and Lower Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Colonies {{were four}} of the {{thirteen}} <b>colonies</b> <b>in</b> British America, located between the New England Colonies and the Southern Colonies.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, {{thousands}} of English Puritans settled in North America, mainly in New England. Puritans were generally {{members of the}} Church of England who believed that the Church of England was insufficiently reformed, retaining too much of its Roman Catholic doctrinal roots, and who therefore opposed royal ecclesiastical policy under Elizabeth I of England, James I of England, and Charles I of England. Most Puritans were [...] "non-separating Puritans", meaning {{that they did not}} advocate setting up separate congregations distinct from the Church of England; a small minority of Puritans were [...] "separating Puritans" [...] who advocated setting up congregations outside the Church. The Pilgrims were a Separatist group, and they established the Plymouth <b>Colony</b> <b>in</b> 1620. Non-separating Puritans played leading roles in establishing the Massachusetts Bay <b>Colony</b> <b>in</b> 1629, the Saybrook <b>Colony</b> <b>in</b> 1635, the Connecticut <b>Colony</b> <b>in</b> 1636, and the New Haven <b>Colony</b> <b>in</b> 1638.
