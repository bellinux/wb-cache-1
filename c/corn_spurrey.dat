This moth flies from June to October depending on the location and there is one generation per year. It can be found on heaths, sand dunes, cliffs and open heaty woodland.|$|E
50|$|A {{comparison}} of vegetation surveys of Scotstown Moor, performed in 1968 and 1998, {{shows that the}} number of plant species in the area has declined. Species have been lost from all habitat types, although those of the open water and open/waste ground have suffered the most. For example, marsh arrowgrass (Triglochin palustris), early marsh orchid (Dactylorhiza incarnata), common twayblade (Listera cordata), <b>corn</b> <b>spurrey</b> (Spergula arvensis) and various species of dead nettle (Lamium spp.) have all been lost from the site.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cover crops {{may have}} direct or {{indirect}} effects on the physical and chemicalsoil attributes; these cropsplay {{a key role in}} the cycling of nutrients in the soil and add labile organic carbon, bringing economic and environmental benefits to the system. To study the effect of cover crops on the physical and chemical properties of an Oxisol, a three-year experiment was conducted in a commercial vineyard located at Epagriâ€™s Experimental Station in Videira, SC, Brazil. Different winter species (white clover, red clover, common vetch, turnip, <b>corn</b> <b>spurrey,</b> black oat, rye, and ryegrass) were sown in addition to treatments with manual weeding or mechanical mowing. Certain chemical and physical attributes of soil were determined in samples collected fromlayers 0 - 0. 1 and 0. 1 - 0. 2 m deep on the vinerows and between rows, as well as the dry mass of winter cover crops. Few chemical and physical attributes of the soil changed among winter cover crops and did not differ from the crops managed with mechanical mowing or hand weeding of spontaneous vegetation. Vine rows provided more adequate values of most physical and chemical soil attributes...|$|E
