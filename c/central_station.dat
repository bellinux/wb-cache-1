5|$|Construction on Metrorail's 23rd station, Miami <b>Central</b> <b>Station</b> at Miami International Airport, {{began in}} May 2009; service began on July 28, 2012. A new Orange Line was launched, which {{runs from the}} airport and merges with the Green Line at Earlington Heights Station, where the two run {{concurrently}} to Dadeland South Station. At the new Miami <b>Central</b> <b>Station,</b> the Orange Line connects with the new MIA Mover which runs directly into the central terminal of the airport. Miami International Airport has over 35 million annual passengers is the county's largest employer. Thus the Orange Line is believed to create {{a significant increase in}} Metrorail ridership. The new Miami <b>Central</b> <b>Station</b> is expected to eventually attract 7,500 daily passengers to Metrorail. The project was completed on time and under budget.|$|E
