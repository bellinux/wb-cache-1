40|$|Abstract Background To {{evaluate}} the cytotoxic effect of carbon ion radiotherapy and chemotherapy in glioblastoma cells in vitro. Methods and Materials The human glioblastoma (GBM) cell line U 87 was irradiated with photon radiotherapy (RT) doses of 2 Gy, 4 Gy and 6 Gy. Likewise, irradiation with carbon ions was performed with single carbon doses of 0. 125, 0. 5, 2 and 3 Gy. Four <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>substances,</b> camptothecin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel and cisplatinum, {{were used for}} single and combination experiments. The assessment {{of the effect of}} single and double treatment on cell viability was performed using the clonogenic growth assay representing the radiobiological gold standard. Results The RBE of carbon ions ranges between 3. 3 and 3. 9 depending on survival level and dose. All <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>substances</b> showed a clear does-response relationhips. in their characteristic concentrations. For subsequent combination experiments, two dose levels leading to low and medium reduction of cell survival were chosen. Combination experiments showed additive effects independently of the drugs' mechanisms of action. Paclitaxel and campthothecin demonstrated the most prominent cytotoxic effect in combination with carbon ion radiotherapy. Conclusion In conclusion, combination of carbon ion radiotherapy with chemotherapies of different mechanisms of action demonstrates additive effects. The most dominant effect was produced by paclitaxel, followed by camptothecin, as espected from previously published work. The present data serve as an important radiobiological basis for further combination experiments, as well as clinical studies on combination treatments. </p...|$|R

40|$|If metastatic {{prostate}} cancer gets resistant to antiandrogen therapy, {{there are few}} treatment options, because {{prostate cancer}} is not very sensitive to cytostatic agents. Temozolomide (TMZ) as an orally applicable <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>substance</b> has been proven to be effective and well tolerated with occasional moderate toxicity especially for brain tumors and an application to prostate cancer cells seemed to be promising. Unfortunately, TMZ was inefficient {{in the treatment of}} symptomatic progressive hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). The reasons could be a low sensitivity against TMZ the short plasma half-life of TMZ, non-adapted application regimens and additionally, the aneuploid DNA content of prostate cancer cells suggesting different sensitivity against therapeutical interventions e. g. radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Considerations to improve this unsatisfying situation resulted in the realization of higher local TMZ concentrations, sufficient to kill cells regardless of intrinsic cellular sensitivity and cell DNA-index. Therefore, we reformulated the TMZ by ligation to a peptide-based carrier system called TMZ-BioShuttle for intervention. Th...|$|E

Cisplatin is an established <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>substance</b> commonly used in the treatment of cancer. Several reports have been published on its antineoplastic activity and toxicity however, no details are available on its noxious effects on the genital system organs such as testes. Another interesting element Selenium and its derivatives including Sodium selenite are reported to form the active center of glutation peroxidase which has antioxidant properties involved in antioxidant balance of the cells and in lipid peroxidation. This study was aimed to explore the effects of selenium against the damage caused in testes of rats by Cisplatin treatment. Sprague-Dawley rats 28 in number were randomly allotted to different standard and treatment groups. All the animals in different experimental groups were maintained under controlled standard conditions. The results clearly demonstrated that Cisplatin treatment decreased the weight of testes as well as the body weight of rats.

40|$|Mantle cell {{lymphoma}} (MCL) is {{an aggressive}} B-cell malignancy with bad prognosis, which predominates in males with advanced age. However, {{studies of the}} endocannabinoid system and how it affects tumour behaviour provides the basis for designing innovative therapeutic strategies that could open new opportunities for treatment of patient with MCL. It has earlier been shown that the cannabinoid receptor ligand (R) -(+) -methanandamide (R-MA) induce cell death in MCL by accumulation of ceramide. Ceramide has a pro-apoptotic effect on the cell but could be metabolized by the enzymes glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) and sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK 1) to molecules with pro-proliferative effect. Therefore, treatments with R-MA on Jeko- 1 MCL cell line were performed in this study to determine interference in the proliferative behaviour {{as well as in}} the gene expression of the enzymes GCS and SphK 1. In addition, treatments with chemotherapeutic substances, such as doxorubicin or cytarabine (Ara-C), and combinations of R-MA and <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>substance,</b> were performed for the same reason. Results showed that the proliferation behaviour of Jeko cells remained unaffected when treated with R-MA, in contrast to the decreased proliferative effects shown when treated with cytostatics or combinations of R-MA and cytostatics. Furthermore, a tendency for up-regulation of GCS and SphK 1 expression was recognized when cells were treated with cytostatics or combination of cytostatics and R-MA, in contrast to cells treated with R-MA alone. Although, R-MA alone had a tendency for a small down-regulation of GCS expression, it contributed to a potential elevation of GCS expression when combined with Ara-C or doxorubicin. It is believed that the effect from upregulated levels of the metabolizing enzymes GCS and SphK 1 is balanced by, earlier observed, up-regulations of the ceramide synthesis enzymes...|$|E

40|$|Cisplatin wurde, nachdem es in den späten 1970 er Jahren von der FDA zugelassen wurde, als Chemotherapeutikum eingeführt. Trotz dessen heilender Wirkung bleiben ernsthafte Nebenwirkungen und entweder erworbene oder intrinsische Resistenz die größten Nachteile von Cisplatin. Folglich wurde weiter geforscht, um neue platin-basierte krebshemmende Medikamente zu entwickeln. Bisher erhielten zwei weitere Platin(II) Wirkstoffe, nämlich Carboplatin und Oxaliplatin, die weltweite Zulassung als Chemotherapeutika. In den letzten Jahrzehnten gewann nicht nur die Entwicklung platinbasierter Wirkstoffe in der Oxidationsstufe +II, sondern auch Platin(IV) Verbindungen mehr Aufmerksamkeit, da diese einige Vorteile gegenüber ihren Vorgängern aufweisen: Sie ermöglichen eine bessere pharmakologische Abstimmung aufgrund von sechs anstelle von vier Koordinationsstellen, und sie ermöglichen aufgrund ihrer kinetischen Inertheit eine orale Verabreichung. Da Platin(IV) Komplexe durch Reduktion in der Zelle aktiviert werden, kann zusätzlich die systemische Toxizität reduziert werden. Der Inhalt dieser Dissertation wurde in drei verschiedene Projekte unterteilt: Im ersten Projekt wurde die Reduktion von vier 13 C- und 15 N-markierten Platin(IV) Komplexen mittels 2 D Spektroskopie in Krebszelllysaten untersucht. Da einige ferrocenhältige Verbindungen zytotoxische Aktivität aufweisen, war die Synthese und Charakterisierung der ersten krebshemmenden Platin(IV) -Verbindungen, welche einen oder zwei Ferrocenreste beinhalten, das Ziel des zweiten Projekts. Durch die Abspaltung der axialen Liganden bei der Reduktion in der Zelle könnte die {{antiproliferative}} Wirkung der Platin- als auch von der Ferrocenyl-Verbindung kombiniert werden; für alle synthetisierten Komplexe konnten in den humanen Krebszelllinien SW 480 und CH 1 IC 50 Werte im niedrigen mikromolaren Bereich gefunden werden. Im letzten Projekt wurden Paltin(IV) -Komplexe an biologisch abbaubare Polyphosphazene gekoppelt, um tumorspezifische Wirkstoffe durch die Ausnutzung des EPR Effekts herzustellen. Erste {{in vitro}} Untersuchungen zeigten eine vielversprechende antiproliferative Aktivität sowie eine hohe zelluläre Akkumulation des Polymer-Platin(IV) -Konjugats in drei verschiedenen humanen Krebszelllinien. Cisplatin was introduced as <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>substance</b> after being {{approved by the}} FDA in the late 1970 s. Despite its curative potential, cisplatin’s major drawbacks remain its severe side-effects and either acquired or intrinsic resistance of several cancer types. Thus, further development of novel platinum-based anticancer drugs was carried out. Up to date, two additional platinum(II) agents gained worldwide market approval as chemotherapeutics, namely carboplatin and oxaliplatin. During the last decades, not only development of platinum-based agents in the oxidation state +II, but also that of platinum(IV) compounds gained more attention, since the latter show several advantages over their precursors: They allow a better pharmacological fine-tuning due to six instead of four coordination sites, and they open up the possibility of oral administration due to their kinetical inertness. Additionally, systemic toxicity might be reduced since platinum(IV) compounds are activated by reduction inside the tumor tissue. The content of this PhD work was divided in three different projects: In the first project, reduction of four 13 C- and 15 N labelled platinum(IV) complexes, synthesized by oxidation and functionalization of either cisplatin or carboplatin, in cancer cell lysates was observed by means of 2 D NMR spectroscopy. Since several ferrocenyl containing compounds show cytotoxic activity, {{the aim of the}} second project was to synthesize and characterize the first anticancer platinum(IV) compounds bearing one or two ferrocene moieties in the axial position. By loss of axial ligands upon reduction inside the cell, the antiproliferative potential of both platinum and ferrocenyl compounds could be combined; for all of the synthesized complexes, IC 50 values in the low micromolar range in SW 480 and CH 1 human cancer cell lines could be detected. In the last project, platinum(IV) complexes were coupled onto biodegradable polyphosphazenes in order to design tumor-targeting agents by taking advantage of the EPR effect. Preliminary in vitro investigations showed promising antiproliferative activity as well as high cellular accumulation of the polymer-platinum(IV) conjugate in three different human cancer cell lines...|$|E

Availability of cell culture models with acquired resistance could help to identify candidate treatments for an efficient second-line therapy. Six cisplatin- and six gemcitabine-resistant cell lines were established. Cell viability assays were performed to evaluate the sensitivity to 16 different <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>substances.</b> The activity of the drug transporter ATP-binding cassette transporter, subfamily B, member 1 (ABCB 1, a critical mediator of multidrug resistance in cancer) was evaluated using fluorescent ABCB 1 substrates. For functional assessment, cells overexpressing ABCB 1 were generated by transduction with a lentiviral vector encoding for ABCB 1, while zosuquidar was used for selective inhibition. In this study, 8 of 12 gemcitabine- or cisplatin-resistant cell lines were cross-resistant to carboplatin, 5 to pemetrexed, 4 to methotrexate, 3 to oxaliplatin, 5 -fluorouracil, and paclitaxel, and 2 to cabazitaxel, larotaxel, docetaxel, topotecan, doxorubicin, and mitomycin c, and 1 of 12 cell lines was cross-resistant to vinflunine and vinblastine. In one cell line with acquired resistance to gemcitabine (TCC-SUPrGEMCI 20), cross-resistance seemed to be mediated by ABCB 1 expression.

As parameters, the IL- 6 production, proliferation, apoptosis/necrosis, and cell cycle phases of the cells were taken. To measure the IL- 6 production, apoptosis/necrosis, and cell cycle phases, the substances were tested in dose ranges of 10, 50, and 100 µg/ 106 cells. To measure the proliferation of the cells, the substances were tested in dose ranges of 1, 5, and 10 µg/ 105 cells. The profile of the antitumour effects of the two substances is identical.

40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the therapeutic results and toxicity in a homogeneous patient group with cervical cancer and histologically confirmed primary paraaortic lymph node metastases after combined radiochemotherapy. Patients and Methods Altogether, 44 patients were evaluated. The therapy included extended-field-radiation-therapy, a combined chemotherapy and a subsequent brachytherapy. All toxicities were documented according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Local relapses, paraaortic relapses, the occurrence of distant metastases, the disease-free-survival (DFS) and the overall-survival (OS) were documented and depicted with Kaplan-Meier-Curves. Results 40 of the 44 patients were diagnosed with laparoscopic operative staging. 4 patients underwent a CT-guided biopsy. The cervical tumor was irradiated with an overall dose of 50. 4 Gy. The parametrium was irradiated with a single dose of 1. 8 Gy up to an overall dose of 9 or with a simultaneously integrated boost (SIB) including a single dose of 2. 12 Gy up to an overall dose of 59. 36 Gy. The paraaortic region was irradiated up to an overall dose of 50. 4 Gy. As combined chemotherapy 38 patients received cisplatin with a dose of 40 /m²/body surface and 5 carboplatin with a dose of AUC 1. 5 - 2 per week. From the third week of therapy, a brachytherapy was started. The follow-up was 30 - 76 months with a mean of 25. 1 months. 89 % of the patients showed acute toxicity. There was no acute gastrointestinal and/or genitourinary toxicity >grade- 3 and one case of acute haematological toxicity grade 4. 21 patients (48 %) developed late toxicity. 20 of them showed ≤ grade 3 toxicity and one a grade 5 genitourinary toxicity, due to a vesico-vaginal-fistula with consequential death due to sepsis. The estimated local tumor control was 89. 1 % after 2 years and 83 % after 5 years. The paraaortic control was 98 % after 5 years. The estimated distant metastases-free survival rate was 64 % after 2 years and 34 % after 5 years. The DFS was 61. 4 % after 2 years and 29. 1 % after 5 years. The OS rate was 68. 4 % after 2 years and 54. 1 % after 5 years. Conclusion In this study a completely homogenously staged and treated group was evaluated. Optimal treatment cannot be reached with a clinical staging system only. The therapy showed a satisfying tolerance and an outstanding locoregional and paraaortic tumor control.

40|$|Pathologically altered neoangiogenesis plays {{a pivotal}} role in {{different}} neurosurgical pathologies. A special neurosurgical focus on angiogenesis exists in glioblastoma multiforme als well as in Moyamoya vasculopathy. Therefore, it was the aim of this work to investigate the importance of pathologic neovascularization for the pathophysiology and treatment of glioblastoma multiforme and Moyamoya vasculopathy. Different clinical and experimental methods were used to investigate microcirculation in glioblastoma and Moyamoya vasculopathy. Especially in malignant glioma the focus was on preclinical experimental therapy models using intravital microscopy investigating the effects of different antiangiogenic and vascular targeting strategies. In Moyamoya vasculopathy, intraoperative indocyanine green videoangiography was used to assess cortical microcirculation. Additionally, digital subtraction angiography was used to assess angiographic effects of different revascularization techniques. The results of this work demonstrate, that Tank-Binding-Kinase 1 represents a proangiogenic and proinflammatory mediator in tumor angiogenesis and therefore may represent a novel therapy target e. g. for the treatment of malignant glioma. Moreover, antiangiogenic therapy in glioblastoma multiforme leads to a significant reduction of vascular density, {{but at the same time}} induces vascular resistance mechanisms that lead to significant anatomic and functional alterations of microcirculation that enhance vascular delivery of <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>substances.</b> In this therapeutic context, glioblastoma multiforme microcirculation represents a very suitable target for vascular targeting strategies using the fibronectin extradomain B antibody fragment L 19 -SIP. L 19 -SIP preferentially binds to high perfusion microvessels and immature microvessels with a special focus on vascular sprouts. Vascular binding is followed by a secondary extravasation process into tumor interstitium. After antiangiogenic therapy, L 19 -SIP shows a significantly enhanced binding in therapy-resistant, high-flow tumor vessels. This opens specific diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities for L 19 -SIP mediated therapy strategies. In Moyamoya vasculopathy, cortical microcirculation is significantly altered in comparison to patients suffering from atherosclerotic cerebrovascular compromise. Moyamoya patients are characterized by significantly increased cortical microvascular density leading to reduced peripheral vascular resistance compensating for reduced cerebral blood flow due to stenoocclusion of the basal cerebral arteries. Consequently, patients without neurological symptoms show higher cortical microvascular density and improved hemodynamics as compared to patients with clinically evident cerebral ischemia. Based on this knowledge, Moyamoya vasculopathy may be divided into 3 different grades (using digital subtraction angiography, cerebral MRI and assessment of hemodynamic reserve) that allow the prediction of the stroke risk of each individual hemisphere. Moyamoya specific neoangiogenic potential also exerts a significant effect on different revascularization techniques. In adult Moyamoya vasculopathy patients, a combined revascularization technique (STA-MCA bypass + encephalomyosynangiosis) is superior in restoring cerebrovascular reserve capacity compared to an indirect procedure (encephalomyosynangiosis). In conclusion, the results of this work demonstrate, that neovascularization plays {{a pivotal role}} for the pathophysiology and treatment of glioblastoma multiforme and Moyamoya vasculopathy...|$|R
40|$|Radioactive and {{transgenic}} tracing experiments {{indicate that}} the adult adrenal cortex is maintained by a common pool of stem cells, which reside in {{the periphery of the}} adrenal cortex in the subcapsular zone. For repopulation, adrenal progenitor cells migrate towards the organ center, where they differentiate within the different specialized adrenocortical zones and take over specific adrenocortical functions. However, isolation and detailed investigation of adrenal progenitor cells has been hampered by the lack of known marker genes. There is convincing data that utilizing the side population, which is based on Hoechst 33342 dye exclusion, leads to an enrichment of progenitor or stem cells in the hematopoietic system and multiple other tissues. In the absence of known stem cell marker genes, we employed the side population technique on adrenal cells. In contrast to non-side population cells, side population cells readily grew over several passages in vitro. Furthermore, after 4 weeks in culture, immunohistochemistry revealed steroidogenic enzyme expression, suggesting spontaneous differentiation. Microarray analysis was performed and showed that the two populations clearly differed on the mRNA level. However, none of the genes analyzed presented with a substantially higher expression level to be considered a valuable adrenal stem cell marker candidate. Interestingly, the quantity of side population cells was significantly diminished in the context of Pbx 1 haploinsufficiency. This transgenic mouse model is associated with smaller adrenal glands, a lower adrenal proliferation rate, and impaired adrenal function, suggesting a stem cell deficit in these animals. In contrast, Tpit-/- mice, which are ACTH-deficient, presented with a subcapsular zone width, which was significantly enlarged in comparison to wild type adrenals. Accordingly, the number of side population cells in these mice was significantly higher. ACTH treatment of these animals not only reverted the subcapsular zone width back to normal, but also resulted in a reduction of the side population fraction to a level similar to that of wild type animals, providing indirect evidence for a stem cell ‘arrest’ in the state of ACTH deficiency. Overall, adrenal side population cells seem to be enriched with progenitor cells with a rather differentiated or designated phenotype. To define the characteristics of multipotent versus somatic adrenal stem cells, a fusion model was established. Herein, PEG mediated cell fusion between murine adult adrenal and embryonic stem cells was performed, however, did not render the expected spectrum of progenitor cells. The involvement of stem cell like cancer cells in adrenal tumorigenesis was assessed by identifying the side population in different human adrenal tumor entities and in the human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line NCI H 295 R. The latter were analyzed further and characterized, however, a tumor stem cell-like behavior could not be detected: NCI H 295 R side population cells had no greater contribution to tumor growth compared to the other cells and had no survival benefit upon exposure to <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>substances,</b> typically administered in this tumor entity. Therefore, identifying side population cells does not per se guarantee stemness, and should always result in further extensive investigations. ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{decades of}} research, {{progress}} in targeted drug delivery is relatively slow, hampered, in part, {{by the lack}} of appropriate mechanisms to deliver anticancer drugs selectively to tumor tissues. Systemic or oral administration can cause severe toxicity, which limits the therapeutic potential of anticancer drugs*. Therefore, the most important goal of drug delivery is to minimize the exposure of normal tissues to these drugs while maintaining their therapeutic concentration in tumors. ^ A photovoltaic cell (PV) is a system that converts lights into electricity as well as induces charge transfer by photovoltaic effect. Motivated by such unique property, we have hypothesized that a PV, which holds opposite charges on its surfaces, can serve as a new drug delivery system to carry cancer <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drugs or <b>substances</b> and release them when the charge intensity or polarity changes upon external photo stimulation, such as near Near-Infrared (NIR) light or Laser source. In this new strategy, taking advantage of the attraction and repulsion between a photovoltaic device and a substance is proposed to serve as a new drug delivery method. ^ *Please refer to dissertation for reference. ...|$|R
40|$|In der kombinatorischen Substanztestung steigen, mit gebräuchlichen Mikro-titerplatten-Methoden, die benötigten Pipettierschritte mit der Anzahl der verwendeten Konzentrationen und Substanzen exponentiell an. Die Verminderung von Pipettierschritten in kombinatorisch angelegten Experimenten bedeutet daher eine wichtige methodische Weiterentwicklung. In der klinischen Anwendung von Chemotherapeutika sind empirische Daten immer noch Grundlage für die Behandlungspläne von Krebspatienten. Dabei werden Subpopulationen von Patienten, die weniger oder gar nicht auf eine bestimmte Substanzkombination reagieren, nicht ausreichend berücksichtigt. Der Ansatz der Testmethode, welche in dieser Dissertation vorgestellt wird, mit der individuelles Ansprechen von Patienten auf Wirkstoffe vorhergesagt werden kann, soll helfen die Behandlung von Krebspatienten in der Zukunft zu verbessern. Um die {{genannten}} Verbesserungen zu erreichen, wird das Phänomen der Diffusion ausgenutzt, welche in dem dafür neu entwickelten sogenannten "Diffusion Device" Anwendung findet. Durch die orthogonale Anordnung zweier Diffusionsrichtungen wird hierbei die Möglichkeit geschaffen, stufenlos unendlich viele Mischungs-verhältnisse zu erreichen. Im Rahmen dieser Dissertation wurde die Funktionsweise und Anwendung des Diffusion Device optimiert und mit einem zellbasierten Bioassay verbunden. Dazu wurde der Diffusion Device zuerst auf alle für die Diffusion wichtigen Parameter untersucht und validiert. Danach wurden chemotherapeutische Substanzen im Diffusion Device auf Zelllinien und primäre Zellisolate getestet. Bei den dabei implementierten Bioassays handelt es sich um einen annexinbasierten Apoptosenachweis und einen MTT-Zytoxizitätstest. Prioritäten der Arbeit lagen auf der einfachen Handhabung und dem geringen Gebrauch von Resourcen und technischem Equipment. Ebenfalls wichtig war die Möglichkeit der parallelisierten Anwendung der Devices, um mehrere Zelllinien, Zellisolate oder Wirkstoffe gleichzeitig und zeitsparend messen zu können. Potentielle Anwendungsgebiete dieser Methode sind das Sekundärscreening von Kombinations-Wirkstoffkandidaten und die Diagnostik von Krebspatienten für eine individeulle Behandlung mit Chemotherapeutika. Zusätzlich wurden für die Mikroarray-Arbeit "stimulus {{dependence of}} the action of small-molecule inhibitors in the CD 3 /CD 28 signaling network" (Kohler et al. 2008), kombinatorische Experimente mit T-Zellen durchgeführt. Hier wurde gezeigt, dass die unterschiedliche Gewichtung von CD 3 /CD 28 Stimulationen zu unerwarteten Ergebnissen bei der Testung von Kinaseinhibitoren führen kann. Dafür wurden verschiedene Kinaseinhibitoren und auch kleine inhibitorische Moleküle, wie Ciclosporin und FK 506, die den T-Zell Signalweg beinflussen können, angewendet. Als Messgröße für die Stimulation der T-Zellen wurde die IL- 2 Expression herangezogen und mittels ELISA bestimmt. In experiments with combinations of substances, pipetting steps in standard micro plate methods increases exponentially {{with the number of}} substances and the concentrations which should be tested. Minimizing these pipetting steps in combi-natorial experiments could mean a good improvement for further methodical development. In the clinical application of chemotherapeutics primarily empirical findings are crucial. Thereby patient subgroups which don't or less respond to a certain drug combination are often not considered. The approach of the preclinical method presented in this dissertation with which individual patient responses could be foreknown, can be an important development in the treatment of cancer patients. To reach these aims the phenomena of diffusion has been employed. Therefore a so called "diffusion device" has been invented. Due to an orthogonal arrangement of two diffusion directions we had the ability to create many substance mixtures. In this present dissertation the handling and function of the "diffusion device" has been optimized and a cell based bioassay has been implemented. Potential application areas for this approach are the secondary screening of drug candidates or the application in the field of individualized diagnostic. To accomplish this, first steps had been validation of all diffusion parameters of the diffusion device. Then <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>substances</b> were tested against cancer cell lines and primary cancer cells. The implemented bioassays were an annexin linked apoptosis assay and a MTT-cytotoxicity assay. Priority laid on simple handling and low equipment usage. The next step after implementation of the bioassays has been an implementation of parallelization with which the testing of several cell lines or drug combinations at once could been showed. In addition of the microarray work "stimulus {{dependence of the}} action of small-molecule inhibitors in the CD 3 /CD 28 signaling network" (Kohler et al. 2008) combination experiments were carried out with t-cells. It was the aim to prove that different t-cell stimuli can lead to an unexpected result in kinase inhibitor testing. Therefore several kinase inhibitors had been applied as well as ciclosporin and FK 506 under different stimuli ratios of anti-CD 3 and anti-CD 28 antibodies. As readout the expression of the cytokine IL- 2 had been measured. Additionally some pharmacological kinase inhibitors which {{were not included in the}} microarray work of Kohler et al. had been used...|$|R
40|$|The {{scientific}} progress {{about the}} important <b>chemotherapeutic</b> drug <b>substance</b> cisplatin (CDDP) and its function {{has often been}} rendered by data difficult to interpret, and still many questions about {{its mode of action}} remains to be clarified by the scientific community. However, studies of CDDP possess a high complexity due to; i) low intracellular concentration, ii) many potential biomolecule targets, iii) poor or unknown stability of the intact drug and its biomolecule adducts and iv) complex and varying sample matrices. Metallomic studies, using advanced analytical techniques may contribute to clarify the interactions between CDDP and intracellular biomolecules. For a successful outcome sample preparation conditions as well as separation and detection techniques must be carefully selected and optimized to achieve accurate results and correct interpretation of data.         This thesis describes some new and improved analytical methodologies for characterizing the Pt metallome in CDDP-exposed malignant cells. The developed methods are based on powerful liquid chromatography (LC) methods hyphenated to sensitive detection by inductively coupled plasma- (ICP) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS). Consideration has also been taken about sample preparation conditions.         By selecting “chemically inert” sample preparation (cell lysis by osmosis) and separation (using only nonreactive or no additatives) conditions we could avoid the formation of platinum artifact compounds previously described in the literature (Paper I and II). Using oxygen containing organic solvents with high boiling points (dimethylformamide; DMF, 1, 4 -dioxane, n-propanol and ethanol) as alternatives to acetonitrile in the LC separations, significant improvements were achieved in ICPMS sensitivity and robustness. When evaluated in combination with chromatographic performance and ESIMS detection the overall best performance was achieved with n-propanol (Paper II, III and IV). From the studies in Paper II we could show that free intact CDDP can be found in malignant cells, as supporting evidence for passive or endocytotic uptake of the drug and further estimate a half-life for intracellular CDDP to about 15 minutes. Such data has not been shown before. In Paper V, the above improved LC methods were used to demonstrate differences in the platinum and cupper metallome from sensitive and resistant T 289 melanoma cells exposed to CDDP at near clinical levels.         In a wider perspective we have shown the potential of using hydrophilic liquid interaction chromatography (HILIC) hyphenated to ICPMS detection as a general approach for analysis of hydrophilic metallo-compounds (Paper II). Taking advantage of the superior ICPMS performance using n-propanol gradients for reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) possess a true alternative and /or complimentary technique to size exclusion chromatography (SEC) commonly applied within metallomic studies of biomolecules (Paper V). Using n-propanol in HILIC as well as in RPLC enables parallel detection by ICP- and ESIMS using only one set of chromatographic parameters (Paper III and IV), something commonly called for by scientists in the field...|$|R
40|$|Derzeit ist die Frage nach der optimalen Therapie der Lyme-Borreliose noch nicht abschließend geklärt. Fälle von Therapieversagen sind aber für fast alle eingesetzten antibiotischen Substanzen beschrieben. Zudem stellen chronische Verläufe die behandelnden Ärzte immer wieder vor Probleme. Eine genauere Charakterisierung der Antibiotikaempfindlichkeit von Borrelien ist daher wünschenswert, zumal bislang nur wenig über die natürliche Resistenz des Erregers und die pharmakodynamischen Wechselwirkungen zwischen Antibiotika und Borrelien in vivo und {{in vitro}} bekannt ist. Neuen, einfach zu handhabenden, standardisierten Tests zur Empfindlichkeitsprüfung antibiotischer Substanzen kommt hierbei eine entscheidende Rolle zu. Das in der vorgelegten Arbeit verwendete kolorimetrische Mikrodilutionsverfahren war benutzerfreundlich in der Anwendung und erwies sich als zuverlässig, reproduzierbar und genau. Die für bekannte Standardsubstanzen ermittelten MHK- und MBK-Werte für Borrelien sind in sehr guter Übereinstimmung mit den Ergebnissen anderer Autoren unter ähnlichen experimentellen Bedingungen. Die hier vorgelegten Ergebnisse zeigen eine verbesserte in-vitro-Aktivität neuerer Fluorchinolone gegen Borrelien. Fluorchinolone wie Gatifloxacin, Sitafloxacin und Gemifloxacin (Klasse-IV-Fluorchinolone) waren bezüglich ihrer in-vitro-MHK-Werte mit denen von einigen beta-Lactam-Antibiotika annähernd vergleichbar. Allerdings lagen die MHK- und MBK-Werte von Mezlocillin und Piperacillin noch deutlich unter denen der {{genannten}} Chinolone. Insgesamt zeigten Fluorchinolone der Klassen IV und III eine stärkere in-vitro-Aktivität gegen Borrelien als Aminoglykoside, Ansamycine und Monobactame. Für Chinolone mit guter bis sehr guter Wirksamkeit gegen B. burgdorferi ergab sich folgende Rangfolge: Gemifloxacin (MHK 90 : 0, 12 µg/ml) > Sitafloxacin (MHK 90 : 0, 5 µg/ml); Grepafloxacin (MHK 90 : 0, 5 µg/ml) > Gatifloxacin (MHK 90 : 1 µg/ml); Sparfloxacin (MHK 90 : 1 µg/ml); Trovafloxacin (MHK 90 : 1 µg/ml) > Moxifloxacin (MHK 90 : 2 µg/ml); Ciprofloxacin (MHK 90 : 2 µg/ml) > Levofloxacin (MHK 90 : 4 µg/ml). Im Gesamtvergleich aller Substanzen zeigte sich folgende Rangordnung für Antibiotika mit guter bis sehr guter in-vitro-Aktivität: Mezlocillin (MHK 90 : kleiner/gleich 0, 06 µg/ml); Piperacillin + Tazobactam (MHK 90 : kleiner/gleich 0, 06 µg/ml) > Gemifloxacin (MHK 90 : 0, 12 µg/ml) > Penicillin G (MHK 90 : 0, 25 µg/ml); Meropenem (MHK 90 : 0, 25 µg/ml) > Grepafloxacin (MHK 90 : 0, 5 µg/ml); Sitafloxacin (MHK 90 : 0, 5 µg/ml); Amoxicillin + Clavulansäure (MHK 90 : 0, 5 µg/ml); Imipenem (MHK 90 : 0, 5 µg/ml) > Gatifloxacin (MHK 90 : 1 µg/ml); Sparfloxacin (MHK 90 : 1 µg/ml); Clinafloxacin (MHK 90 : 1 µg/ml); Trovafloxacin (MHK 90 : 1 µg/ml); Vancomycin (MHK 90 : 1 µg/ml). Die umfassende statistische Analyse aller experimentell bestimmten MHK- und MBK-Werte für die verschiedenen untersuchten Antibiotika ergab z. T. signifikante Genospezies-spezifische Unterschiede bei der Empfindlichkeit der getesteten Isolate des B. burgdorferi-Komplexes gegen Penicillin G, Meropenem, Mezlocillin, Piperacillin, Amoxicillin, Aztreonam, Sitafloxacin, Grepafloxacin, Gemifloxacin, Norfloxacin, Ofloxacin und Pefloxacin. Insgesamt zeigten B. garinii-Isolate dabei interessanterweise signifikant niedrigere MBK- und z. T. auch niedrigere MHK-Werte als die übrigen eingesetzten Borrelia-Genospezies. Die höchsten MBK-Werte wurden hingegen bei den getesteten B. burgdorferi s. s. -Isolaten beobachtet. Vor dem Einsatz von Fluorchinolonen in der Therapie der Lyme-Borreliose müssen aber zunächst die Ergebnisse von klinischen Studien abgewartet werden. Moderne Chinolone sind als möglicher alternativer Therapieansatz bei Lyme-Borreliose insofern interessant, als sie bekanntermaßen auch gegen andere durch Zecken übertragene Krankheitserreger wie den Erreger der Humanen Granulozytären Ehrlichiose (HGE) und manche Rickettsia spp. wirksam sind. At present, {{the question for}} optimum therapy of Lyme disease remains unresolved. Moreover, {{little is known about}} the pharmacodynamic interactions between antibiotic substances and borreliae in vivo. Therapeutic failures have been reported for almost every suitable antimicrobial agent currently available. In addition, a protracted course of the disease and resistance to conventional treatment continue to pose problems for clinicians in the therapy of Lyme disease. Further characterization of the antibiotic susceptibility patterns and a better understanding of the interactions of B. burgdorferi with antimicrobial agents are urgently needed. New techniques for sensitivity testing of B. burgdorferi may pave the way for further studying the possible factors that can influence the bacteriostatic and bactericidal action of recently introduced <b>chemotherapeutic</b> <b>substances</b> under more standardized conditions. The colorimetric microdilution method employed in the present study was user-friendly and proved to be precise, reliable and reproducible. The MIC and MBC concentrations determined for Borrelia corresponded well with the results of other authors working under similar experimental conditions. As demonstrated here, the recently introduced quinolones show enhanced in vitro activity against borreliae. The fluoroquinolones such as gatifloxacin, sitafloxacin and gemifloxacin (class IV fluoroquinolones) showed in vitro activites (MICs and MBCs) that were comparable to beta-lactams and even better than those of the tested aminoglycosides, ansamycines and monobactames. Only mezlocillin and piperacillin had lower MICs than the tested quinolones. The following rank order of quinolones with good to excellent in vitro activity was found: Gemifloxacin (MIC 90 : 0. 12 µg/ml) > sitafloxacin (MIC 90 : 0. 5 µg/ml); grepafloxacin (MIC 90 : 0. 5 µg/ml) > gatifloxacin (MIC 90 : 1 µg/ml); sparfloxacin (MIC 90 : 1 µg/ml); trovafloxacin (MIC 90 : 1 µg/ml) > moxifloxacin (MIC 90 : 2 µg/ml); ciprofloxacin (MIC 90 : 2 µg/ml) > levofloxacin (MIC 90 : 4 µg/ml). The comparison of all tested antimicrobial agents resulted in the following ranking: Mezlocillin (MIC 90 : less or equal than 0. 06 µg/ml); piperacillin + tazobactam (MIC 90 : less or equal than 0. 06 µg/ml) > gemifloxacin (MIC 90 : 0. 12 µg/ml) > penicillin G (MIC 90 : 0. 25 µg/ml); meropenem (MIC 90 : 0. 25 µg/ml) > grepafloxacin (MIC 90 : 0. 5 µg/ml); sitafloxacin (MIC 90 : 0. 5 µg/ml); amoxicillin + clavulan acid (MIC 90 : 0. 5 µg/ml); imi-penem (MIC 90 : 0. 5 µg/ml) > gatifloxacin (MIC 90 : 1 µg/ml); sparfloxacin (MIC 90 : 1 µg/ml); clinafloxacin (MIC 90 : 1 µg/ml); trovafloxacin (MIC 90 : 1 µg/ml); vancomycin (MIC 90 : 1 µg/ml). Detailed statistical analysis of all experimentally determined MIC and MBC values for the antibiotics tested revealed sometimes significant genospecies-specific differences in the sensitivity of B. burgdorferi isolates to penicillin G, meropenem, mezlocillin, piperacillin, amoxicillin, aztreonam, sitafloxacin, grepafloxacin, gemifloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin. Interestingly, B. garinii isolates showed significantly lower MBC values and sometimes also lower MIC levels than the other Borrelia genospecies tested. On the other hand, the highest MBC values were observed with B. burgdorferi s. s. isolates. If effective also in vivo, quinolones may serve as useful agents in the stage-dependent therapy of Lyme disease and other newly emerged tickborne diseases like the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) and some Rickettsia spp. The potential role of a single or possibly combined application of such new antimicrobial agents, however, has to be evaluated further by in vivo studies and clinical trials...|$|R
