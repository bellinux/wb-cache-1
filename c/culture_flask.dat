50|$|A549 {{cells are}} adenocarcinomic human {{alveolar}} basal epithelial cells. The A549 cell line was first developed in 1972 by D. J. Giard, et al. through the removal and culturing of cancerous lung {{tissue in the}} explanted tumor of a 58-year-old caucasian male. In nature, these cells are squamous and responsible for the diffusion of some substances, such as water and electrolytes, across the alveoli of lungs. If A549 cells are cultured in vitro, they grow as monolayer cells, adherent or attaching to the <b>culture</b> <b>flask.</b> The human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 may be anchored or suspended in a solution in vitro.|$|E

40|$|Heparin and heparan sulfate are structurally-related {{carbohydrates}} with therapeutic {{applications in}} anticoagulation, drug delivery, and regenerative medicine. This study explored {{the effect of}} different bioreactor conditions on the production of heparin/heparan sulfate chains via the recombinant expression of serglycin in mammalian cells. Tissue <b>culture</b> <b>flasks</b> and continuously-stirred tank reactors promoted the production of serglycin decorated with heparin/heparan sulfate, as well as chondroitin sulfate, while the serglycin secreted by cells in the tissue <b>culture</b> <b>flasks</b> produced more highly-sulfated heparin/heparan sulfate chains.

40|$|Efficient {{micropropagation}} of papaya (Carica papaya L.) {{has become}} crucial for multiplication of specific sex types of papaya or transgenic lines resistant to virus infection. In this study, aeration at different intervals with a 0. 02 mu m filter disc in {{the closure of}} <b>culture</b> <b>flasks</b> ensured exchange of gas components. The effect of aeration on development of multibuds to multishoots was investigated. Multibuds grown, in <b>culture</b> <b>flasks</b> after one-week without aeration followed by a two-week aeration treatment caused a 41 % {{increase in the number}} of shoots greater than or equal to 0. 5 cm, 42 % increase in leaf expansion, and 17 % increase in leaf numbers in comparison with unaerated materials. Ethylene and oxygen concentrations in the <b>culture</b> <b>flasks</b> were measured by gas chromatography and oxygen electrode at weekly intervals during the culture period. Oxygen concentrations were slightly different between aerated and unaerated <b>culture</b> <b>flasks.</b> Ethylene in the unaerated flask reached the highest level (0. 11 ppm) 2 weeks after the treatment, while accumulation of ethylene in the aerated flasks was not detected. The multishoots grown for 3 weeks without aeration showed growth retardation on leaves and epinasty on petioles...|$|R

50|$|Diabetic ulcer {{fibroblasts}} show various morphological differences {{compared to}} fibroblasts from age matched controls. Diabetic ulcer fibroblasts are usually large and widely {{spread in the}} <b>culture</b> <b>flask</b> compared to the spindle shaped morphology of the fibroblasts in age-matched controls. They often show dilated endoplasmic reticulum, numerous vesicular bodies and lack of microtubular structure in transmission electron microscopy study. Therefore, interpretation of these observations would be {{that in spite of}} high protein production and protein turnover in diabetic ulcer fibroblasts, vesicles containing secretory proteins could not travel along the microtubules to release the products outside. Fibroblasts from diabetic ulcer exhibit proliferative impairment that probably contributes to a decreased production of extracellular matrix proteins and delayed wound contraction and impaired wound healing.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, mDC probably {{arise from}} monocytes, {{white blood cells}} which circulate in the body and, depending on the right signal, can turn into either dendritic cells or macrophages. The monocytes in turn are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow.Monocyte-derived dendritic cells can be generated in vitro from {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs). Plating of PBMCs in a tissue <b>culture</b> <b>flask</b> permits adherence of monocytes. Treatment of these monocytes with interleukin 4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) leads to differentiation to immature dendritic cells (iDCs) in about a week. Subsequent treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) further differentiates the iDCs into mature dendritic cells. Monocytes can be induced to differentiate into dendritic cells by a self-peptide Ep1.B derived from apolipoprotein E. These are primarily tolerogenic plasmacytoid dendritic cells.|$|E

50|$|Adherent cells, {{for example}} many {{mammalian}} cell lines, grow {{attached to a}} surface such as {{the bottom of the}} <b>culture</b> <b>flask.</b> These cell types have to be detached from the surface before they can be subcultured. For adherent cells cell density is normally measured in terms of confluency, the percentage of the growth surface covered by cells. The cells will often have a preferred range of confluencies for optimal growth, for example a mammalian cell line like HeLa or Raw 264.7 generally prefer confluencies over 10% but under 100%, and subculture will normally try to keep the cells in this range. For subculture cells may be detached by one of several methods including trypsin treatment to break down the proteins responsible for surface adherence, chelating calcium ions with EDTA which disrupts some protein adherence mechanisms, or mechanical methods like repeated washing or use of a cell scraper. The detached cells are then resuspended in fresh growth medium and allowed to settle back onto their growth surface.|$|E

The cells became less sensitive to detachment by physical shear or by treatment with trypsin or EDTA; however, their morphology, as observed by phase contrast microscopy, did not change. The effects of Con A were prevented by the simultaneous addition of either D-glucose or a-methyl-n-glucoside with the Con A. Also addition of these reagents to the attached cells after Con A treatment partially reversed the effects caused by Con A.
