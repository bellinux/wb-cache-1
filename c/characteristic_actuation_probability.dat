40|$|Abstract—Electrostatic {{actuators}} exhibit {{fast response}} times and are easily integrated into microsystems {{because they can}} be fabricated with standard IC micromachining processes and mate-rials. Although electrostatic actuators have been used extensively in “dry ” MEMS, they have received less attention in microfluidic systems probably because of challenges such as electrolysis, an-odization, and electrode polarization. Here we demonstrate that ac drive signals can be used to prevent electrode polarization, and thus enable electrostatic actuation in many liquids, at potentials low enough to avoid electrochemistry. We measure the frequency response of an interdigitated silicon comb-drive actuator in liquids spanning a decade of dielectric permittivities and four decades of conductivity, and present a simple theory that predicts the <b>characteristic</b> <b>actuation</b> frequency. The analysis demonstrates the importance of the native oxide on silicon actuator response, and suggests that the actuation frequency can be shifted by controlling the thickness of the oxide. For native silicon devices, actuation is predicted at frequencies less than 10 MHz, in electrolytes of ionic strength up to 100 mmol/L, and thus electrostatic actua-tion may be feasible in many bioMEMS and other microfluidic applications.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} simulating the flight dynamics and control strategies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The framework consists of five main components: an articulated rigid-body simulation, {{a model of the}} aerodynamic forces and moments, a sensory systems model, a control model, and an environment model. In the rigid-body simulation the fly is represented by a system of three rigid bodies connected by a pair of actuated ball joints. At each instant of the simulation, the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the wings and body of the fly are calculated using an empirically derived quasi-steady model. The pattern of wing kinematics is based on data captured from high-speed video sequences. The forces and moments produced by the wings are modulated by deforming the base wing kinematics along certain <b>characteristic</b> <b>actuation</b> modes. Models of the fly’s visual and mechanosensory systems are used to generate inputs to a controller that sets the magnitude of each actuation mode, thus modulating the forces produced by the wings. This simulation framework provides a quantitative test bed for examining the possible control strategies employed by flying insects. Examples demonstrating pitch rate, velocity, altitude, and flight speed control, as well as visually guided centering in a corridor are presented...|$|R
40|$|Osmotic {{actuation}} is a ubiquitous plant-inspired actuation {{strategy that}} has a very low power consumption but is capable of generating effective movements {{in a wide variety}} of environmental conditions. In light of these features, we aimed to develop a novel, low-power-consumption actuator that is capable of generating suitable forces during a <b>characteristic</b> <b>actuation</b> time on the order of a few minutes. Based on the analysis of plant movements and on osmotic actuation modeling, we designed and fabricated a forward osmosis-based actuator with a typical size of 10 mm and a characteristic time of 2 - 5 minutes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the fastest osmotic actuator developed so far. Moreover, the achieved timescale can be compared to that of a typical plant cell, thanks to the integrated strategy that we pursued by concurrently addressing and solving design and material issues, as paradigmatically explained by the bioinspired approach. Our osmotic actuator produces forces above 20 N, while containing the power consumption (on the order of 1 mW). Furthermore, based on the agreement between model predictions and experimental observations, we also discuss the actuator performance (including power consumption, maximum force, energy density and thermodynamic efficiency) in relation to existing actuation technologies. In light of the achievements of the present study, the proposed osmotic actuator holds potential for effective exploitation in bioinspired robotics systems...|$|R

Some roboticists have explored this idea in robotic actuators, striving for improvements {{such as the ability}} to withstand partial damage, inexpensive repeatability by discrete open loop control and the potential of modular actuators.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate a new method and a new practice of engineering low-cost, actuatable mechanisms. This work investigates the theory and practice which are needed to lay a foundation for the design of actuated mechanisms that consist of discrete functional sheets. The various requirements of traditional, functional components are embodied in sheets, or layers, of material rather than in discrete components (e. g. actuators, links, gears, etc [...] .). The functional layers are designed to be bonded together in a way that forms an actuatable mechanism. These compliant layered mechanisms, CLMs, consist of four layers: (1) a skeleton cut from a single sheet of material that provides structural elements and compliant amplification mechanisms, (2) actuation, (3) control circuitry, and (4) sensors or other functional components as needed. This thesis presents the design, modeling, fabrication, and experimental validation of the CLM concept. Precision machines with integrated stiffness <b>characteristics,</b> <b>actuation,</b> and control circuitry are realized through forming / folding the CLM sheet. The CLM is implemented in a five axis nano-manipulator capable of a range of hundreds of microns and a resolution of tens of nanometers. The CLM manipulator is modeled using a node/beam stiffness matrix in CoMeTTM. The performance of the manipulator and the accuracy of the model are verified through a series of experiments in which the manipulator is made to translate (Y and Z) and rotate (OX). The skeleton of the CLM utilizes thin elliptical compliant amplifier mechanisms (TECAs) to provide amplification and guidance of the actuators. (cont.) The behavior of the TECA is shown to be governed by the transmission ratio (amplification) and the ratio of the width to thickness of the flexure elements. A parametric design tool was developed enabling designers to predict and control the performance of TECAs subjected to a combination of desired and undesired forces through optimization of these key ratios. The CLM offers advantages in applications beyond manipulation which currently require costly mechanisms based on discrete functional components. Two such applications are morphing structures such as the Smart Wing under development by NASA and DARPA [1], and energy transducing and damping mechanisms. by Nathan M. Landsiedel. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{study of}} {{compressor}} instabilities in gas turbine engines has received much attention in recent ears. In particular, rotating stall and surge are major causes of problems ranging from component stress and lifespan reduction to engine explosion. In this thesis, modeling {{and control of}} rotating stall and surge using bleed valve and air injection is studied and validated on a low speed, single stage, axial compressor at Caltech. Bleed valve control of stall is achieved only when the compressor characteristic is actuated, due to the fast growth rate of the stall cell compared to the rate limit of the valve. Furthermore, experimental {{results show that the}} actuator rate requirement for stall control is reduced by a factor of fourteen via compressor <b>characteristic</b> <b>actuation.</b> Analytical expressions based on low order models (2 - 3 states) and a high fidelity simulation (37 states) tool are developed to estimate the minimum rate requirement of a bleed valve for control of stall. A comparison of the tools to experiments show a good qualitative agreement, with increasing quantitative accuracy as the complexity of the underlying model increases. Air injection control of stall and surge is also investigated. Simultaneous control of stall and surge is achieved using axisymmetric air injection. Three cases with different injector back pressure are studied. Surge control via binary air injection is achieved in all three cases. Simultaneous stall and surge control is achieved for two of the cases, but is not achieved for the lowest authority case. This is consistent with previous results for control of stall with axisymmetric air injection without a plenum attached. Non—axisymmetric air injection control of stall and surge is also studied. Three existing control algorithms found in literature are modeled and analyzed. A three—state model is obtained for each algorithm. For two cases, conditions for linear stability and bifurcation criticality on control of rotating stall are derived and expressed in terms of implementation—oriented variables such as number of injectors. For the third case, bifurcation criticality conditions are not obtained due to complexity, though linear stability property is derived. A theoretical comparison between the three algorithms is made, via the use of low—order models, to investigate pros and cons of the algorithms in the context of operability. The effects of static distortion on the compressor facility at Caltech is characterized experimentally. Results consistent with literature are obtained. Simulations via a high fidelity model (34 states) are also performed and show good qualitative as well as quantitative agreement to experiments.

Two plate structures are considered which employ the planar Kagome truss as the actuation plane. It is shown that these plates can be actuated with minimal internal re-sistance to achieve {{a wide range of}} shapes, while also sustaining large loads through their isotropic bending/stretchin...|$|R
40|$|Electroactive {{conducting}} polymers, such as polypyrrole, polyaniline, and polythiophenes {{are currently}} studied as novel biologically inspired actuators. The actuation mechanisms in these materials {{are based on}} the diffusion of ions {{in and out of the}} polymer film. Giving ions more access to the center of the films by inducing holes on its surface can improve strain rates. A unique surface templating technique using breath figures has been developed for poly (3 -hexylthiophene). Spherical holes form on the surface of polymer films during the drop casting process if moist air was blown over the top of the film. This technique has been used to generate 0. 8 - 5 /m holes on the surface of poly(3 -hexylthiophene) films. It can also be used to create columns 3 to 10 /tm in height in polypyrrole. Free standing spongy films (10 - 35 iLm in thickness) of poly(3 -hexylthiophene) were generated using this technique and the influence of the additional surface area on the actuation of poly(3 -hexylthiophene) and polypyrrole films has been characterized. (cont.) Actuation seen in poly(3 -hexylthiophene) films was not <b>characteristic</b> of <b>actuation</b> seen in polypyrrole or in poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene). Poly(3 -hexylthiophene) shows a voltage dependant on-off mechanism as well as a non charge dependant actuation mechanism. This has been primarily attributed to the change in the polymer modulus during the actuation cycle. The subsequent part of this thesis begins the development of linear system identification techniques to track the effect of the changing modulus during actuation. by Priam Vasudevan Pillai.
