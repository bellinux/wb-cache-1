5000|$|In {{the early}} years of Superman comics, the sun of Krypton was unnamed and was given no effect on Superman's powers, which were {{attributed}} first to greater evolution, and then to a combination of innate powers and Earth's lower gravity. Starting in 1960, the fact that Earth's sun was yellow while Krypton's was red became the explanation for Superman's powers, with our sunlight fueling them like the <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery.</b> In the standard Silver Age continuity existing up until Crisis on Infinite Earths, Rao's red sun radiation actively suppressed the superhuman abilities of Kryptonians, as their powers only worked in the radiation of a yellow sun. The post-Crisis version created by John Byrne stated that Kryptonians absorbed solar energy, with the dim output of Rao being just enough to sustain them, and a yellow sun producing enough energy to [...] "supercharge" [...] a Kryptonian metabolism to levels of power not seen in their native environment, though it takes years for Clark Kent to build up enough energy to reach the level of power he displays as Superman. The 2004 graphic novel Superman: Birthright corroborates this, although in recent years, other writers have depicted red-sun radiation matching that of Rao as once again actively shutting down Kryptonian powers, for as long as an individual is exposed to it.|$|E
50|$|In April 1775, Pigot was {{appointed}} governor and commander-in-chief of Madras {{in the place}} of Alexander Wynch. He resumed office at Fort St. George on 11 December 1775, and soon found himself at variance with some of his council. In accordance with the instructions of the directors he proceeded to Tanjore, where he issued a proclamation on 11 April 1776 announcing the restoration of the Raja, whose territory had been seized and transferred to Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah, Nawab of the Carnatic in spite of the treaty which had been made during Pigot's previous tenure of office. Upon Pigot's return from Tanjore the differences in the council became more accentuated. Paul Benfield had already asserted that he held assignments on the revenues of Tanjore for sums of vast amount lent by him to the Nawab, as well as assignments on the growing crops in Tanjore for large sums lent by him to other persons. He now pleaded that his interests ought not to be affected by the reinstatement of the raja, and demanded the assistance of the council in recovering his property. Pigot refused to admit the validity of these claims, but his opinion was disregarded by the majority of the council, and his customary right to precedence in the conduct of business was denied. The final struggle between the governor and his council was on a comparatively small point—whether his nominee, Mr. Russell, or Colonel Stuart, the nominee of the majority, should have the opportunity of placing the administration of Tanjore {{in the hands of the}} Raja. In spite of Pigot's refusal to allow the question of Colonel Stuart's instructions to be discussed by the council, the majority gave their approval to them, and agreed to a draft letter addressed to the officer at Tanjore, directing him to deliver over the command to Colonel Stuart. Pigot thereupon declined to sign either the instructions or the letter, and declared that without his signature the documents could have no legal effect. At a meeting of the council on 22 August 1776, a resolution was carried by the majority denying that the concurrence of the governor was necessary to constitute an act of government. It was also determined that, as Pigot would not sign either of the documents, a letter should be written to the secretary authorizing him to sign them in the name of the council. When this letter had been signed by George Stratton and Henry Brooke, Pigot snatched it away and formally charged them with an act subversive of the authority of the government. By the standing orders of the company, no member against whom a charge was preferred was allowed to deliberate or vote on any question relating to the charge. Through this ingenious manœuvre, Pigot obtained a majority in the council by his own casting vote, and the two offending members were subsequently suspended. On 23 August, the refractory members, instead of attending the council meeting, sent a notary public with a protest in which they denounced Pigot's action on the previous day, and declared themselves to be the ‘only legal representatives of the Honourable Company under this presidency.’ This protest was also sent by them to the commanders of the king's troops, and to all persons holding any authority in Madras. Enraged at this insult, Pigot summoned a second council meeting on the same day, at which Messrs. Floyer, Palmer, Jerdan, and Mackay, who had joined Messrs. Stratton and Brooke and the commanding officer, Sir Robert Fletcher, in signing the protest, were suspended, and orders were at the same time given for the arrest of Sir Robert Fletcher. On the following day Pigot was arrested by Colonel Stuart and conveyed to St. Thomas's Mount, some nine miles from Madras, where he was left in an officer's house under the <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> of artillery. The refractory members, under whose orders Pigot's arrest had been made, immediately assumed the powers of the executive government, and suspended all their colleagues who had voted with the governor. Though the government of Bengal possessed a controlling authority over the other presidencies, it declined to interfere.|$|E

40|$|In many {{applications}} {{it is essential}} to predict the remaining capacity of a battery reliably, accurately and simply. Several existing techniques for predicting the remaining capacity of a lead-acid battery discharged with a variable current are based on variants of Peukert’s empirical equation, which relates the available capacity to a constant discharge current. This paper presents a critical review of these techniques in the light of experimental tests that were carried out on two lead-acid commercial batteries. The relevance of these Peukert’s equation based techniques to lithium-ion batteries is also discussed in the light of tests carried on a lithium-ion power battery.

40|$|Battery Health Management (BHM) is a core {{enabling}} {{technology for the}} success and widespread adoption of the emerging electric vehicles of today. Although battery chemistries have been studied in detail in literature, an accurate run-time battery life prediction algorithm has eluded us.

The amount of usable <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> for a given discharge profile is not only dependent on the starting state-of-charge (SOC), but also other factors like battery health and the discharge or load profile imposed.

The batteries are modeled at three different levels of granularity with associated uncertainty distributions, encoding the basic electrochemical processes of a Lithium-polymer battery.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a preliminary economic {{study on the}} feasibility of using electric vehicles (EVs) to provide demand response, carried out {{as part of the}} GREEN Grid project. A mathematical model is developed to track the <b>charge</b> cycle <b>of</b> <b>an</b> EV <b>battery,</b> and this in turn provides estimates of the cost associated with battery life degradation under different scenarios. Three case studies are presented in this paper: the first investigates the potential cost saving for the EV owner by confining the <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> EV <b>battery</b> to the night tariff period; the second investigates the financial gain associated with regulating the <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> EV <b>battery</b> based on spot prices; and the third investigates the possible economic benefit for the EV owner of participating in the electricity market by buying energy at low prices and selling at high prices. The first case also includes the situation <b>of</b> just <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> being used to store energy during the night to run a household during the day. Results show that it is most economical to charge an EV during the night (Case 1), but that it varies considerably depending on the region in New Zealand. Regulating the charging rate depending on the spot price (Case 2) provides a small benefit. Using the EV to trade energy (Case 3) is, in most cases, uneconomic given the degradation of battery life. The variation of Case 1 also shows that at current battery costs, it is not economic to store energy during the night for use during the day. Given that there will be other costs associated with these activities, such as the <b>charger</b> equipment capable <b>of</b> both importing and exporting energy from the grid, the economics do not appear to favour use of EVs for demand response provision, except for the case of simply adjusting the time <b>of</b> <b>charging</b> to suit the tariff...|$|R
