Applicants with disabilities and able-bodied applicants report similar feelings of anxiety towards an interview. [...] Applicants with disabilities often report that interviewers react nervously and insecurely, which leads such applicants to experience anxiety and tension themselves. The interview is felt to be {{the part of the}} selection process where <b>covert</b> <b>discrimination</b> against applicants with disabilities can occur. Many applicants with disabilities feel they cannot disclose (i.e., inform potential employer of disability) or discuss their disability because they want to demonstrate their abilities. If the disability is visible, then disclosure will inevitably occur when the applicant meets the interviewer, so the applicant can decide if they want to discuss their disability. If an applicant has a non-visible disability, however, then that applicant has more of a choice in disclosing and discussing. In addition, applicants who were aware that the recruiting employer already had employed people with disabilities felt they had a more positive interview experience. Applicants should consider if they are comfortable with talking about and answering questions about their disability before deciding how to approach the interview.|$|E

The {{new immigrants}} who were housed in transit camps, brought {{different ways of}} life and thought with them, that were misunderstood to the most-part of European originated immigrants. Most notable was the complaint of the Moroccan hot temper, which clashed with the neighbors’ culture and slower temper.

Already {{in the early years}} of statehood, with the establishment of the policy of population dispersal, signs of a struggle against the settlement coordinators began, since those tried to halt the phenomenon of the abandoning of settlements on the borders of Israel. The transition of Moroccans from border lines villages to the city, and their rejection of an agricultural lifestyle, was assumed to indicate their refusal to participate in productive enterprises and the Judaization of the land that the state intended for them, and an active strategy of dealing with separation and socialization processes which the country was implementing in the fifties.Discriminatory policies led to, among other things, an active protest whose two most prominent manifestations were in the “Wadi Salib events", led by David Ben-Arush against ongoing discrimination and the establishment of the [...] "Black Panthers" [...] movement. They set themselves a goal; to promote their social status and they fought passionately to earn their place in Israeli society. It took eighteen more years, after the events in 1977 in “Wadi Salib”, for the North African immigrants to be heard clearly in national politics. In the 1977 revolution their demographic power became evident where they succeeded in bringing the “Likkud” national party to power, led by Menachem Begin, and overthrow the “Mapai” government. Due to this change in regime, many of the first and second generation of immigrants from Islamic countries (the [...] "second Israel") felt that this would give them a voice, and influence over the leadership state, which was hitherto denied to them during Mapai’s reign.|$|E

40|$|Rhythm as {{the time}} {{structure}} of music is composed of distinct temporal components such as pattern, meter, and tempo. Each feature requires different computational processes: meter involves representing repeating cycles of strong and weak beats; pattern involves representing intervals at each local time point which vary in length across segments and are linked hierarchically; and tempo requires representing frequency rates of underlying pulse structures. We explored whether distinct rhythmic elements engage different neural mechanisms by recording brain activity of adult musicians and non-musicians with positron emission tomography (PET) as they made <b>covert</b> same-different <b>discriminations</b> of (a) pairs of rhythmic, monotonic tone sequences representing changes in pattern, tempo, and meter, and (b) pairs of isochronous melodies.

Meter processing alone activated areas in right prefrontal and inferior frontal cortex associated with more cognitive and abstract representations. Pattern processing alone recruited right cortical areas involved in different kinds of auditory processing. Tempo processing alone engaged mechanisms subserving somatosensory and premotor information (e. g., posterior insula, postcentral gyrus). Melody produced activity different from the rhythm conditions (e. g., right anterior insula and various cerebellar areas). These exploratory findings suggest the outlines of some distinct neural components underlying the components of rhythmic structure...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Covert visual spatial {{attention}} {{is a relatively}} new task used in brain computer interfaces (BCIs) and {{little is known about the}} characteristics which may affect performance in BCI tasks. We investigated whether eccentricity and task difficulty affect alpha lateralization and BCI performance. APPROACH: We conducted a magnetoencephalography study with 14 participants who performed a <b>covert</b> orientation <b>discrimination</b> task at an easy or difficult stimulus contrast at either a near (3. 5 °) or far (7 °) eccentricity. Task difficulty was manipulated block wise and subjects were aware of the difficulty level of each block. MAIN RESULTS: Grand average analyses revealed a significantly larger hemispheric lateralization of posterior alpha power in the difficult condition than in the easy condition, while surprisingly no difference was found for eccentricity. The difference between task difficulty levels was significant in the interval between 1. 85 s and 2. 25 s after cue onset and originated from a stronger decrease in the contralateral hemisphere. No significant effect of eccentricity was found. Additionally, single-trial classification analysis revealed a higher classification rate in the difficult (65. 9 %) than in the easy task condition (61. 1 %). No effect of eccentricity was found in classification rate. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that manipulating the difficulty of a task gives rise to variations in alpha lateralization and that using a more difficult task improves covert visual spatial attention BCI performance. The variations in the alpha lateralization could be caused by different factors such as an increased mental effort or a higher visual attentional demand. Further research is necessary to discriminate between them. We did not discover any effect of eccentricity in contrast to results of previous research...|$|R

This study differs from other research in that I focus on how conversations between workers reproduce and reinforce racism and sexism in the workplace through race- and gender-talk. By looking at micro-level interactions in the workplace, I suggest that we can determine and even predict the salience of race- and gender-talk depending on the context of that situation. For example, I posit that race-talk mostly occurs in conversations that are all white male. In comparison, gender- talk will dominate in racially mixed settings. Although my focus is on race- and gender-talk, I suggest that class-talk is also predictable, albeit on a more complex scale that needs to be further examined in the future...|$|R
40|$|This {{argues for}} the revisiting of classificatory {{concepts}} currently {{in use in}} the study of 'race', racism and anti-racism. It examines the proposition that racist movements no longer promote discrimination on the grounds of a belief in biological differences but espouse a 'differentialist' racism based on a conviction in the fixity of culture, paradoxically 'borrowed' from culturally relativist anti-racist arguments. A critique of the differentialist thesis developed by Pierre-Andre Taguieff is presented based upon the writings of Etienne Balibar and Paul Gilroy. The former, by grounding modern racism in the ideological universalism of the European Enlightenment project, argues that the apportioning of blame to anti-racism for abetting the advent of culturalist racism is unhelpfully conceived from a perspective which seeks to deny the legitimacy of black and ethnic minority led alliances as a basis for anti-racist struggles. The novel connection is made between these arguments and those of Paul Gilroy (1998) who proposes the redundancy of the term 'race', even from pragmatist perspectives, in the revitalisation of anti-racism as a viable opposition to contemporary racist discourses. The argument is made that in order to dissect normative understandings of 'race' it is necessary to follow the historical trajectory taken by racism in becoming an inextricable component of the modern project. Anti-racism, thus, must be seen as a multi-layered conflict and, therefore, separate from its anti-fascist, anticolonialist, leftist and institutionalised forms. Evidence from recent interviews with anti-racist activists points to their rejection of both 'culturalist' and 'biological' approaches to racism and towards broad alliances of community-led activists against overt but also <b>covert,</b> institutionalised racist <b>discrimination...</b>|$|R

Detailed analysis of 3000 sport reports and photographs from 4 national West German newspapers showed that the press functioned as a normalising agent in the discourse of sport, which, amongst other things, legitimises the marginal position of women in sport by invoking the apparently natural differences between the sexes. Discursive strategies include exclusion of women from reports, as well as numerous mechanisms restricting the crossing of group boundaries into previously male domains, e. g. trivialising women’s sport, making them into "non-sport", or use of irony.

40|$|Organisations today {{operate under}} extreme {{pressures}} to be effecient and productive {{to meet the}} challenges of globalisation. The concern for best utilisation of available human resources is at the core of the movement for effeciency and productivity. There is a growing realisation that the quality of top managers, irrespective of gender, is critical to the success and survival of organisations. This has made the advancement of women managers to the top managerial hierarchy an organisational imperative rather than merely an equity issue. Recognising this need, career advancement of women managers, in recent years, has emerged as an important area of research in the field of gender and management. A number of studies have been conducted to examine the factors affecting women's advancement in management careers. Although these studies provide a useful insight into the phenomenon of scarcity of women in top management, they are parochial in nature and are limited in focus. These studies are largely based on the experiences of women managers in the western and industrialised countries and focus only on the personal and organisational factors overlooking the broader societal context. Hence, recently, the need for incorporating systemic dimension into theoretical discourse as well as empirical research on managerial advancement of women has been recognised to explore this phenomenon across cultures. This study develops a gender-organisation-system model of managerial advancement to study the factors affecting career advancement of women. The model is applied to the federal civil service of Pakistan, the largest single employer of women in a non-western, developing and Islamic country. The data are collected using triangulation of methods, self-administered questionnaire, face-to-face interviews and documentation. A sample of 300 civil servants was randomly selected for the study. The findings are based on the analysis of the results of 138 questionnaires received and 30 interviews and examination of the status of women in Pakistani society and the civil service through documentation. The study reveals an inventory of personal, organisational and systemic factors that may facilitate or impede advancement of women civil servants in Pakistan. At the personal level, dual commitment to family and career poses a great dilemma to women civil servants. While parental encouragement, spouse's support, socioeconomic background and educational achievements facilitate women civil servants, the potential barriers to their career advancement are spouse career, time away from family and difficulty in relocation. At the organisational level, women are denied equal career opportunities through indirect and subtle forms of discriminatory practices including gender streaming, work segregation, limited opportunities of training, mentoring and networking. These <b>covert</b> forms of <b>discrimination</b> often go unnoticed and are perpetuated due to a number of organisational factors such as gender-biased selection processes, regional and military quotas, absence of lateral entry, lack of women friendly policies and absence of women from important decision making bodies. The gender and organisational factors affecting career advancement of women civil servants are the mirror images of the role and status of women in Pakistani society. The cultural norms, values, and perceptions about the role of women in society, low level of gender development and gender empowerment, and absence of legal institutional framework for addressing issues of sex discrimination at work are the major systemic factors that adversely affect women's advancement in the civil service hierarchy. The study reveals similarities as well as differences between women administrators in Pakistan and western and non-western countries. Pakistani women administrators like women managers in the other countries are not in any sense less than their counterparts in terms of career commitment, managerial ability and self-confidence. They face barriers that arise from two major forces counteracting their career aspirations, work-family conflict and institutionalised discrimination. However these constraints in Pakistan are not only different in nature and forms but are more intense due to rigid sex-role demarcation and strong family orientation compared with western and industrialised countries. Hence, coping strategies at personal, organisational and systemic levels to deal with these pressures are also different. The study makes several policy recommendations to facilitate women aspiring for managerial careers in general and women civil servants in particular, which includes institutionalised child care, anti-discrimination legislation, flexible working practices, review of recruitment, selection and promotion system, affirmative action, a balanced representation of women in decisionary bodies and gender sensitivity training. Though traditional societal values are in conflict with women's work outside the private sphere, these recommendations if adopted may bring a positive change towards gender equality in managerial careers in Pakistan including the civil service...|$|R

In all three experiments, we found that exogenous attention modulated visual discriminability in a group of high-functioning adults with ASD and that it did so in the same way and to the same extent as in a matched control group.

40|$|The Remote Distractor Effect (RDE) is {{a robust}} {{phenomenon}} where a saccade to a lateralised target is delayed {{by the appearance}} of a distractor in the contralateral hemifield (Walker, Kentridge, & Findlay, 1995). The main aim of this thesis was to test whether the RDE generalises to response modalities other then the eyes. In Chapter 2, the RDE was tested on saccadic and simple manual keypress responses, and on a choice discrimination task requiring a covert shift of attention. The RDE was observed for saccades, but not simple manual responses, suggesting that spatially oriented responses may be necessary for the phenomenon. However, it was unclear whether distractor interference occurred in the covert task. Chapter 4 compared the effects of distractors between spatially equivalent tasks requiring saccadic and manual aiming responses respectively. Again, the RDE was observed for the eyes but not for the hands. This dissociation was also replicated in a more naturalistic task in which participants were free to move their eyes during manual aiming. In order to examine the time-course of distractor effects for the eyes and the hands, a third experiment investigated distractor effects across a wider range of target-distractor delays, finding no RDE for manual aiming responses at distractor delays of 0, 100, or 150 ms. The failure of the RDE to generalise to manual aiming suggests that target selection mechanisms are not shared between hand and eye movements. Chapter 5 further investigated the role of distractors during <b>covert</b> <b>discrimination.</b> The first experiment showed that distractor appearance did not interfere with discrimination performance. A second experiment, in which participants were also asked to saccade toward the target, confirmed the lack of RDE for <b>covert</b> <b>discrimination</b> while saccades were slower in distractor trials. The dissociation between covert and overt orienting suggests important differences between shifts of covert attention and preparation of eye movements. Finally, Chapter 6 investigated the mechanism driving the RDE. In particular it was assessed whether saccadic inhibition (Reingold & Stampe, 2002) is responsible for the increase in saccadic latency induced by remote distractors. Examination of the distributions of saccadic latencies at different distractor delays showed that each distractor produced a discrete dip in saccadic frequency, time-locked to distractor onset, conforming closely to the character of saccadic inhibition. It is concluded that saccadic inhibition underlies the remote distractor effect. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, Adams {{identifies}} {{factors which}} influence {{the effectiveness of}} education provided for Indigenous students, focussing on child poverty (including loss of cultural identity and self-value); the degree of educational disadvantage Indigenous students are likely to experience because of such poverty, {{as well as the}} <b>covert</b> <b>discrimination</b> and racism they have to contend with in the school setting, which frequently leads to their alienation from the schooling process. In discussing educational participation, achievement and absenteeism among Indigenous students, the author suggests that poor educational outcomes apparent in upper primary/lower secondary school are symptomatic of inadequate educational progress {{in the early years of}} schooling. In addressing improvements needed in the provision of education for Indigenous students, Adams points to the need to recognise the importance and equal status of each stage of schooling, the inter-relatedness of all stages and the responsibility incumbent in each stage to ensure a student's satisfactory progression during that stage and into the next. Such an orientation focuses attention on the crucial importance of early childhood education in establishing attitudes to self, as an individual, and as a learner and in developing future attitudes to schooling.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to show that}} the intellectual construct women’s language is entirely justified on a political, ideological, and economic basis that stresses the fact that women have historically been victims of overt (and <b>covert)</b> <b>discrimination</b> and exploitation in our society. Linguistically speaking, however, a women’s language seems not to exist in traditional strict terms, but rather as a rhetorical term used {{in the form of a}} synecdoche. Despite their incompleteness, two attempts of characterizing truly women languages, Nu Shu and Láadan, are discussed, underlining and recognizing their legitimate symbolic value as equalizing manoeuvres. Women have resorted to more subtle linguistic means to emerge as visible agents in our society. Linguistic resources go from a passive acceptance of the traditional all-inclusive generic masculine forms, through the equalizing use of both masculine and feminine markers, to the most progressive, liberal and controversial strategies of using feminizing forms, i. e. all-inclusive generic feminine forms. Women’s struggle to overcome inequity and inequality is a legitimate endeavour which is leaving visible linguistic traces in our languages. Women are changing languages around the world. Key words: Women’s language, Nu Shu, Láadan, inclusive linguistic masculine forms, masculine and feminine linguistic forms, inclusive feminine linguistic forms. 1. Women’s language Robin Lakoff’s seminal book Language and Women’s Place (1975) opened a new strand in linguistic studies when she called the attention to a traditionall...|$|E
40|$|Women {{constitute}} {{approximately half}} of the teaching force of secondary schools in England and Wales but men are three times more likely than women to achieve secondary headship. A similar disproportion of women in senior management in education {{can be found in the}} USA, in other European countries and elsewhere. Reasons for the apparent inequity, identified from the literature, include both overt and <b>covert</b> <b>discrimination,</b> which may affect selection for promotion, and opportunities for professional development within the workplace. Women are also likely to be constrained in their careers by the general acceptance that women bear the prime responsibility for domestic concerns, including the care of children and other dependants. The link with domestic life is likely to influence and encourage stereotypes that place women in a caring role in the workplace. In addition, there are Stereotypes that identify leadership as male (Schein, 1994). The research for this thesis investigates the obstacles to career progress encountered by female headteachers and considers what they, as women, bring to the management and leadership of schools. Research took the form of five in-depth interviews with female headteachers and a postal survey of all the female headteachers in England and Wales. There was a 70 per cent response rate to the survey. The research indicates that discrimination was experienced by approximately two thirds of the headteachers and that this was reported more often by those who were married, who had children and were heads of co-educational schools. However, the vast majority had been encouraged in their career progress, particularly by a previous headteacher, or by a partner. The predominant style of management of the headteachers was caring and people orientated; they tended to be collaborative and consultative. The majority felt that they had to "prove themselves" as a female leader, but that there were advantages in being a woman headteacher...|$|E
40|$|As society {{continues}} {{to become more}} dependent on science and technology, the disparity {{between women and men}} in the sciences not only represents a waste of human capital but is also problematic in terms of principles of gender equity. Yet, despite more than three decades of equal opportunity legislation, women remain underrepresented in the public sphere, and this is particularly evident in the sciences. This article builds on earlier research and investigates some {{of the reasons for the}} continued gender imbalance in the sciences as more and more women eagerly enter the sciences, achieve academic success, and enroll as PhD students, but ultimately do not remain in their chosen scientific field. More specifically, we use "storying" as a way of presenting the doctoral experiences of several women who, despite the unambiguously gender-based harassment they experienced during the period of their candidature, have successfully completed their PhDs in the sciences in Australian universities. We particularly focus on the experiences of women who completed their PhDs in 2007 and 2008. Their story shows how, as a direct consequence of their experiences, these women left their chosen research areas because they felt that they had little or no choice. Given the extant literature (see, for example, Gutek, 1985; Linehan, 2000; Sappleton & Takruri-Rizk 2008; Wirth, 2001), we suggest that their stories are not idiosyncratic but are illustrative of more general and widespread societal positions and concerns. Thus we argue that if the problem of women's underrepresentation in the sciences is to be addressed, we need to look to the masculinist culture of organizations as an explanatory factor. We conclude that it is organizational culture that needs to change and suggest that while antidiscriminatory legislation is important, it is not adequate to address both overt and <b>covert</b> <b>discrimination</b> in the workplace...|$|E
40|$|Back in 2006 I {{published}} {{two articles}} that sum-marized the various points {{that emerged from}} interviews I had conducted with 24 senior women scientists {{from different parts of}} the world (Watt, 2004, 2006 a, 2006 b). I tried to capture their experiences, both personal and professional, over the previous 30 years, to see what had changed and what remained to be done to provide a level playing field for women and men in our profession. By sharing their per-sonal experiences, my interviewees provided a helpful counter-point to studies that are based on statistical analyses of the under-representation of women in science. While a number of posi-tive conclusions emerged from the interviews, the overall picture was rather disheartening, particu-larly with regard to <b>covert</b> <b>discrimination,</b> which is also known as passive discrimination or gender stereotyping. Given the time that has passed since the ori-ginal interviews, I felt that it might be worthwhile to revisit the issue—this time by sharing my own experiences between 2007 and 2012, while I was working in Cambridge. Those experiences make me firmly of the opinion that covert discrimin-ation, of the sort that my interviewees described, is not going to end any time soon. One of the things that I noticed about Cambridge was that I had fewer female colleagues of equivalent seni-ority than when I had worked in London. Opinions differ as to what is an achievable/desirable propor-tion of women in different contexts, whether com-pany boards or scientific institutions. My personal view is that at least 20 % representation of women in any scientific forum is both achievable and desirable. So, are there any issues that are unique to Cambridge? First off, it has to be said that the University is conscious of the low numbers of women academics at the highest levels and has a highly capable, active and committed Gende...|$|E
