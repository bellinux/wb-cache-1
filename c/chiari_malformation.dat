500|$|Syringomyelia (SM) is a {{condition}} affecting the brain and spine, causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. It {{is caused by a}} malformation, commonly known as <b>Chiari</b> <b>Malformation,</b> in the lower back of the skull which reduces the space available to the brain, compressing it and often forcing it out (herniating it) through the opening into the spinal cord. This blocks the flow of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) around the brain and spine and increases the fluid's pressure, creating turbulence which in turn is believed to create fluid pockets, or syrinxes (hence the term syringomyelia), in the spinal cord. Syringomyelia is rare in most breeds but has become widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, with international research samples {{in the past few years}} consistently showing over 90% of Cavaliers have the malformation, and that between 30–70% have syrinxes. However, most dogs with syrinxes are not symptomatic. [...] Although symptoms of syringomyelia can present at any age, they typically appear between six months and four years of age in 85% of symptomatic dogs, according to Clare Rusbridge, a research scientist. Symptoms include sensitivity around the head, neck, or shoulders, often indicated by a dog whimpering or frequently scratching at the area of his neck or shoulder. [...] Scratching is often unilateral– restricted to one side of the body. [...] Scratching motions are frequently performed without actually making physical contact with the body ("air scratching"). [...] The scratching behavior appears involuntary and the dog frequently scratches while walking– without stopping– in a way that is very atypical of normal scratching ("bunny hopping"). [...] Scratching typical of SM is usually worse when the dog is wearing a collar, is being walked on leash, or is excited, and first thing in the morning or at night.|$|E

In an attempt to select appropriate morphometric measures for this pur-pose, we investigated the interobserver reliability and diag-nostic performance of several morphometric measures of <b>Chiari</b> II <b>malformation</b> on MR images. Methods Brain MR images of 79 children [26 with open spinal dysraphism, 17 with closed spinal dysraphism, and 36 without spinal dysraphism; mean age 10. 6 (SD 3. 2; range, 6 – 16) years] were evaluated.

Three observers blindly and independently reviewed the MR images for 21 measures of the cerebellum, brainstem, and posterior fossa in three planes.

However, the interpretation of morphological features of the malformation on MR images may not always be straightforward.

METHODS: Brain MR images of 79 children [26 presumed to have <b>Chiari</b> II <b>malformation,</b> 36 presumed to have no cerebral abnormalities, and 17 children in whom some <b>Chiari</b> II <b>malformation</b> features might be present; mean age 10. 6 (SD 3. 2; range, 6 - 16) years] were blindly and independently reviewed by three observers.
