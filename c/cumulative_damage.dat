25|$|The factors {{proposed}} to influence biological ageing {{fall into two}} main categories, programmed and damage-related. Programmed factors follow a biological timetable, perhaps one {{that might be a}} continuation of the one that regulates childhood growth and development. This regulation would depend on changes in gene expression that affect the systems responsible for maintenance, repair and defence responses. Damage-related factors include internal and environmental assaults to living organisms that induce <b>cumulative</b> <b>damage</b> at various levels.|$|E

40|$|Electrical {{vehicles}} (EVs) have {{a significant}} role in reducing transportation emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. This research has developed a high energy density in-wheel switch reluctance motor (SRM) drivetrain for a small car. The SRM drivetrains overcome the cost and availability issues associated with the permanent magnet motor (PMM), mostly used in EVs. However, the in-wheel SRM developed has an increased mass on suspensions when compared with an equivalent power output PMM drivetrain. Hence, the main aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the durability and life cycles for a small car suspension due to an increased mass.

The results show that vehicles running on uneven road may produce more <b>cumulative</b> <b>damages</b> than static load, and DLC (dynamic load coefficient) changes in wide range, maximum up to 2. 0 or more; the effect of speed and load on dynamic load is complex, and due to multi-factor interaction, DLC doesn’t consistently increase or decrease with speed and load increasing. Although the dynamic load level caused by high-speed heavy vehicle is not necessarily too high, its impact on the road can not be ignored. ...|$|R

The defeat of any particular player takes place when the associated process (representing the collateral damage) crosses a fixed threshold. Once the threshold is exceeded at some time, the associated player exits the game. All involved processes are being "observed by a third party process" so that the information regarding the status of all players is restricted to those special epochs. Furthermore, all processed are modulated (with their parameters being modified in due course of the game). We obtain a closed form joint functional of the named processes at key reference points. </p...|$|R
