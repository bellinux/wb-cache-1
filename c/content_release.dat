The {{purpose of this study}} was to find out the difference in Hg <b>content</b> <b>released</b> from two different kinds of amalgam, namely, high copper amalgam and silverfil argentum carried out in vitro. This study was carried out on thirty premolar teeth of the maxilla which underwent class one occlusal restoration. The Hg <b>content</b> <b>released</b> was measured using the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS). This was a quasi-experimental study. The study results analyzed using the independent t paired statistical test method indicated that after one week of immersion, the average Hg <b>content</b> <b>released</b> from high copper amalgam restoration was 10, 695 ng/mL and from silverfil argentum restoration was 5, 602 ng/mL.

40|$|HIV- 1 fusion {{leading to}} {{productive}} entry {{has long been}} thought to occur at the plasma membrane. However, our previous single virus imaging data imply that, after Env engagement of CD 4 and coreceptors at the cell surface, the virus enters into and fuses with intracellular compartments. We were unable to reliably detect viral fusion at the plasma membrane. Here, we implement a novel virus labeling strategy that biases towards detection of virus fusion that occurs in a pH-neutral environment-at the plasma membrane or, possibly, in early pH-neutral vesicles. Virus particles are co-labeled with an intra-viral content marker, which is released upon fusion, and an extra-viral pH sensor consisting of ecliptic pHluorin fused to the transmembrane domain of ICAM- 1. This sensor fully quenches upon virus trafficking to a mildly acidic compartment, thus precluding subsequent detection of viral <b>content</b> <b>release.</b> As an interesting secondary observation, the incorporation of the pH-sensor revealed that HIV- 1 particles occasionally shuttle between neutral and acidic compartments in target cells expressing CD 4, suggesting {{a small fraction of}} viral particles is recycled to the plasma membrane and re-internalized. By imaging viruses bound to living cells, we found that HIV- 1 <b>content</b> <b>release</b> in neutral-pH environment was a rare event (~ 0. 4 % particles). Surprisingly, viral <b>content</b> <b>release</b> was not significantly reduced by fusion inhibitors, implying that <b>content</b> <b>release</b> was due to spontaneous formation of viral membrane defects occurring at the cell surface. We did not measure a significant occurrence of HIV- 1 fusion at neutral pH above this defect-mediated background loss of content, suggesting that the pH sensor may destabilize the membrane of the HIV- 1 pseudovirus and, thus, preclude reliable detection of single virus fusion events at neutral pH...|$|E

40|$|A single-vesicle, fluorescence-based, SNARE-driven fusion assay enables {{simultaneous}} {{measurement of}} lipid mixing and <b>content</b> <b>release</b> with 5 ms/frame, or even 1 ms/frame, time resolution. The v-SNARE vesicles, labeled with lipid and content markers of different color, dock and fuse with a planar t-SNARE bilayer supported on glass. A narrow (< 5 ms duration), intense spike of calcein fluorescence due to <b>content</b> <b>release</b> and dequenching coincides with inner-leaflet lipid mixing within 10 ms. The spike provides more sensitive detection of productive hemifusion events than do lipid labels alone. Consequently, many fast events previously {{thought to be}} prompt, full fusion events are now reclassified as productive hemifusion. Both full fusion and hemifusion occur with a time constant of 5 – 10 ms. At 60 % phosphatidylethanolamine lipid composition, productive and dead-end hemifusion account for 65 % of all fusion events. However, quantitative analysis shows that calcein is released into the space above the bilayer (vesicle bursting), rather than the thin aqueous space between the bilayer and glass. Evidently, at the instant of inner-leaflet mixing, flattening of the vesicle increases the internal pressure beyond the bursting point. This {{may be related to}} in vivo observations suggesting that membrane lysis often competes with membrane fusion...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{investigate}} innovation processes on innovation platforms, {{and look at}} the role played by <b>content</b> <b>release</b> for innovation in digital distribution of home entertainment. I argue that innovation platforms rely on several aspects of innovation in order to succeed, and this thesis is concerned with one of these, namely release of digital entertainment content. I use the American video streaming service Netflix as a case and example of such an innovation platform. By using technology blogs as my main empirical source, I analyse the discourse that leads up to release or withdrawal of video content between Netflix, a platform owner, and the Hollywood motion picture studios, being the legal owners of video content. I argue that Netflix´s service can be characterised as a generative Internet media platform, implying thatinnovation is promoted by distributing control between several heterogeneous actors, by that creating unforeseen dependencies concerning content, networks, technology and devices. Additionally, the findings suggest that <b>content</b> <b>release</b> was essential for making Netflix´s innovation succeed, and by that allowing for various innovation activities on this platform. It furthermore seems like this innovation has made a broad impact in the cultural industries, as alike versions of Netflix´s streaming service are being established for a range of different content...|$|E
40|$|Thrombotic {{complications}} of pulmonary circulation might occur {{in patients with}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) (1 - 3). It has been suggested that these thrombotic events could be partly tied to the abnormalities found in platelet function. In fact, in vitro and in vivo platelet activation could actually occur in systemic and pulmonary circulation as a result of hypoxemia, acidosis or hyperviscosity, all characteristic findings of COPD. A shortened platelet half-life, as well as increased plasma levels of beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) and enhanced platelet aggregation have been reported in patients with COPD (4 - 7). Moreover, a decrease in platelet survival time has been correlated with chronic hypoxemia, thus suggesting an increased platelet consumption due to in vivo platelet activation (6, 8 - 10). In 1991, Segall and Goetzman (11), in a study carried out on newborn lambs, demonstrated the occurrence of platelet <b>content</b> <b>release</b> in the lung during hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. This observation is in good agreement with the above reported findings of short platelet half-life and in vivo platelet activation in patients with chronic hypoxemia.
