The high ceiling, once finely carved and gilt, was foul with dirt and cobwebs; the naked walls at either end of the room were stained with damp; and the cold of the marble floor struck through the narrow strip of matting laid down, parallel with the windows, as a foot-path for passengers across the wilderness of the room.

The main burning pan was filled with 200 ml No. 0 diesel with 100 ml water below acting as the fire source which was ignited by 5 ml oil. Another pan was filled with 100 ml diesel and acted as the pan waiting to be ignited by the main burning pan. Changing {{the space between the}} two oil pans and the wind velocity in the experiment room, temperature and heat radiation flux of different fire conditions were recorded. Representing the diameter of the main burning pan as D, the results show that, the fireproof distance between the two diesel pans is 0. 6 D when wind velocity is 0. 2 m/s; the fireproof distance increases to 0. 8 D when the wind velocity is raised to 0. 5 m/s; When the wind velocity is 1 m/s, the fireproof distance changes to D. From the observation and analysis on the critical temperature and heat radiant flux received by the fuel surface of the pan waiting to be ignited, {{it can be seen that}} the radiation thermal value accumulated to about 47187. 5 J/m 2 at the moment when the oil pan is ignited...|$|R

The film Temenos explores the phenomenon of visionary experience, taking the viewer to locations where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared, including Lourdes, Fatima and Medjugorje in Croat-occupied Bosnia where the visions continue. Nina Danino films the landscapes that have witnessed these transcendental appearances, imbuing them with a sense of the sacred. These locations are both specific and unknown since viewers are never told where they are. Instead they are taken on a journey, during which they experience the raw exposure of emotion and the haunting voices that appear on the soundtrack. The operatic soprano Catherine Bott, the Tuvan diva Sainkho Namchylak and the New York experimental vocalist Shelley Hirsch all deliver extraordinary performances.

40|$|The Tibetan Plateau {{is one of}} {{the areas}} of the world where humans have had a {{relatively}} minor impact. The plateau thus provides ideal conditions for investigating evapotranspiration (In this paper, evapotranspiration terms are defined as follows: (1) "Actual evapotranspiration" includes evaporation from water and soil and transpiration from the vegetation of a specific region; (2) "potential evapotranspiration" includes the maximum quantity of water capable of being evaporated from the soil and transpired from the vegetation of a specific surface; (3) "reference evapotranspiration" includes the maximum quantity of water capable of being evaporated from the soil and transpired from a hypothetical reference grass with an assumed height of 0. 12 m, a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m(- 1), and an albedo of 0. 23; and (4) "pan evaporation" means evaporation from open <b>circular</b> <b>pans</b> with a diameter of 20 cm.) issues such as temporal trends of evapotranspiration, the pan evaporation paradox, and the complementary relationship hypothesis. We examined Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration and pan evaporation from a 20 -cm pan by using a data set from 75 meteorological observatories across the plateau during the period 1966 to 2003. Actual regional evapotranspiration was estimated in 16 catchments across the plateau during the period 1966 to 2001. Reference evapotranspiration and pan evaporation significantly decreased at 47 and 38 % of observatories, respectively, though air temperature at most of sites significantly increased (P < 0. 05); wind speed and sunshine hours significantly decreased at 85 and 43 % of observatories (P < 0. 05). The annual reference evapotranspiration and pan evaporation averaged from all the observatories significantly decreased (P < 0. 05) while actual annual evapotranspiration averaged from all the catchments increased (P < 0. 1), indicating the existence of a pan evaporation paradox on the plateau. The analysis with a recovered stationary series method showed that decreasing trend in reference evapotranspiration was due to a decrease in wind speed and a decrease in net total radiation, and the increase in air temperature, however, showed little correlation with the declining trends in reference evapotranspiration and pan evaporation. Regional actual evapotranspiration and reference, Penman potential evapotranspiration, or pan evaporation exhibit complementary behavior, which, however, does not support Bouchet's complementary hypothesis, perhaps because of the very low vapor pressure deficit. The current study suggests that the Bouchet's complementary relationship needs to be reconsidered at high elevations...|$|R

The test program involved compressed-air foams (CAF) and aspirated foams of two expansion ratios, and employed two AFFF formulations: a 6 % telomer concentrate and, to obtain base-line measurements, 3 % PFOS FC- 600 concentrate which was manufactured by the 3 M company prior to the PFOS phase out. At lower expansion (7 : 1), the aspirated and compressed-air foams demonstrated similar fire control performance, whilst more expanded (9 : 1) CAF was generally more efficient at extinguishing, but less efficient in controlling the fire. CAF formed a better seal over the fuel surface and at the hot pan walls, and these foams performed noticeably better than aspirated foam against fuel re-ignition. The paper links these observations with the underlying distributions of bubble sizes, which were measured and fitted to modified Rosin/Rammler cumulative volume distribution functions. We propose that a modified version of DEF(AUST) 5706 be adopted as a universal small-scale test protocol...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{occurrence}} of a liquid fuel burning on carpet {{has been involved}} in many incendiary and accidental fires. While the research on a liquid fuel fire on carpet is still limited, much work on porous media has been performed using sand or glass beads soaked with liquid fuel. In this study, a heat and mass transfer theory was first developed to analyze the burning process of liquid on carpet, and then several small-scale tests were performed to validate the theory. This analysis is valid for pool fires intermediate in size (5 - 20 cm. in diameter). The experimental apparatus consisted of a <b>circular</b> <b>pan</b> (105 mm) and a load cell. Varying amounts of fuels (heptane, kerosene and methanol) were spilled onto the carpet, which was allowed to burn in a quiescent environment. It was found that due to the different controlling mechanisms, the liquid burning rate could be less or more than that of a similarly spilled free-burning pool fire. For the worst-case scenario in fires, the maximum enhancement of the burning rate due to the porous media is predictable through the physical properties of the fuel. This analysis is valid for both combustion and evaporation. Several similar results in the scientific literature are analyzed to further describe the trend. This work explains the role of carpet in liquid pool fires and also helps to explain special risks related to the presence of carpet involved in arsons and will be useful in reconstruction of the early development of an incendiary or accidental fire...|$|E

It also provided an opportunity to obtain detailed information on the seafloor morphology and shallow stratigraphy of this understudied region. The seafloor exhibited two morphologies: (1) small-scale (< 2 m) bare-rock karstic features, and (2) thin (< 1 m) linear sand accumulations overlying the bedrock. Solution <b>pans,</b> <b>circular</b> to oblong depressions featured flat bottoms and steep sides, were the dominant karstic features; they are known to form subaerially by the pooling of rainwater and dissolution of carbonate.

Surface sands are organized into linear bedforms oriented NE-SW, 10 's to 100 's meters wide, and kilometers long. These features are identified as sand ribbons (longitudinal bedforms), and contained asymmetric secondary transverse bedforms that indicate NE-directed flow.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} pathogenicity genes in the fungal pathogen of cultivated barley, Rhynchosporium secalis. Pathogenicity genes are described as genes that are critical for the successful invasion and colonisation of the host plant but not necessary for life cycle completion in culture. To identify genes a pool of insertion mutants was generated. Insertional mutants were generated by two methods, restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI) and Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT). A detailed REMI study showed <b>circular</b> <b>pAN</b> 7 - 1 vector produced higher transformation efficiencies than linear vector at all enzyme levels tested. Fungal strain 5, in combination with 20 units of the restriction enzyme BamHI produced the highest observed transformation efficiency with approximately 40 % of these mutants producing simple, single integrations based on interpreted Southern data. The addition of BamHI increased transformation efficiency at all enzyme levels tested with the exception of the highest enzyme concentration: 200 units of enzyme/transformation reaction. In comparison to REMI, the ATMT protocol proved more efficient than REMI and the binary vector backbone pPZP 200 produced > 50 % simple single copy integrations, interpreted from Southern data. This study is the first ATMT protocol for R. secalis and was successfully adapted from other fungal species. In total, 534 BamHI and HindIII REMI mutants of R. secalis fungal strain UK 7 (83) and strain 5 (453) were screened on the universally susceptible barley cultivar Sloop yielding 10 non-pathogenic mutants, eight from strain 5 and two from UK 7, respectively. During screening experiments strain 5 mutants failed to produce enough spores for a spore suspension to be prepared and inoculated. Strain 5 loses the ability to sporulate after four generations, or successive subculture steps. The inability to sporulate was not correlated to an observable, macroscopic loss in fungal biomass. Starvation experiments utilising carbon and nitrogen sources did not alter sporulation in the sporulating strain 5 sample or reverse the loss of sporulation. However, an overall trend was observed in the sporulation of strain UK 7 where sporulation decreased with increasing nitrogen and increased with increasing carbon. Genomic sequence flanking the integration site was isolated and analysed from six of the ten non-pathogenic mutants. Four putative genes were identified with integrations located in their putative promoter sequences. Sequence similarity searches showed three of these putative genes had similarities to amino acid permeases, cytochrome p 450 and rhomboid-like genes. The two putative genes with similarities to amino acid permease and cytochrome p 450 genes were selected for targeted gene disruption studies using homologous recombination (HR). ATMT was used as the delivery system for the HR construct in an attempt to generate a disruption mutant and prove gene function. Over 200 mutants transformed with the two knock out vectors were screened. However, gene disruption experiments failed and could not be repeated due to a lack of resources and time. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that the REMI transformation technique is feasible for gene disruption studies in R. secalis. Furthermore, ATMT is a viable alternative transformation method that, for future studies, would be the preferable technique. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This study {{describes}} the simulation and experimental {{investigation of a}} heptane pool fire, burning within a small compartment, in which interaction between {{a number of key}} physical processes is amplified. In particular, the configuration emphasises the coupling of buoyancy induced ventilation, smoke production and radiation heat transfer to the liquid fuel surface, from the luminous flame zone, from the smoke filled ceiling layer and from the confining walls. This study contrasts with those customarily performed for the purpose of model validation in compartment fires, which employ gas burners and so simplify much of the interaction. Initial experiments were carried out using a 0. 23 m diameter <b>circular</b> <b>pan</b> burning fixed amounts of heptane. Subsequently, a constant supply was used with a smaller circu- lar pan of 0. 17 m in diameter, in order to introduce experimental longevity under safe, controllable conditions whilst establishing a quasi steady-state system. Issues of non- stationarity in relation to heat-feedback to the fuel surface - an important pool fire mech- anism - are discussed. In addition to probe measurements of velocity and thermocouple temperature, the smoke yield was determined using a light extinction technique employing a 670 nm wavelength diode laser and photo-diode detector, housed within a novel fully-traversible water- cooled probe. Data from these experiments illustrate the importance of accounting for room ventilation in terms of overall production of smoke and sound a cautionary note to the labelling of soot by a convenient marker such as temperature. Numerical simulation of the compartment fire is performed using the field model SOFIE, incorporating a simple evaporation model, which relates the mass-loss-rate of fuel to the net heat flux to the fuel surface and heat of gasification. This relationship assumes that heat losses to the pan, re-radiation by the fuel surface and other enthalpy loss terms, are small. Simulations of compartment fire scenarios using this model to calculate the rate of heat release are reported. Further comparisons are made between the industry stan- dard 'Eddy-Breakup' combustion model and the 'Laminar Flamelet' model. In general both the eddy-breakup model and laminar flamelet model tend to underpredict the yields of CO, whilst the eddy-breakup model over-predicts temperature and thus soot. The laminar flamelet approach shows more promise and shows particularly good agreement with the experimental measurements reported here under well ventilated conditions. SORE, the predictive tool employed in this research, has proved invaluable in discern- ing the reason for apparent ambiguities in the experimental measurements of soot con- centration. The results suggest that an alternative simplified zone model approach would overpredict visibility in smoke in terms of concentration, but underpredict in terms of layer depth, due to its inability to capture the important shape of the hot upper layer, which varies significantly from the homogenous, laterally uniform distribution which is assumed. The incorporation of a simple evaporation model which relies on accu- rate prediction of heat transfer in ultimately determining the heat release rate {{has been shown to be}} in very good agreement with the experiments. Despite the irregularity in predicted distribution of mass loss rate across the fuel surface - caused mainly due to the 'ray effect' of the radiation model - the main trend of lower heat transfer at the centre of the burner is demonstrated, in agreement with the experiments performed. This phe- nomenon is captured despite the lack of description of fuel vapour radiation blockage above the fuel surface, suggesting that this process may be disregarded. The heat flux distribution which is found here is in contrast to research conducted by other workers for similar sized pans in an open environment, which show a higher measured heat transfer at the centre of the burner. It has been shown that significant improvements could be made in experimental design of compartment fire experiments if CFD prediction is considered for the determination of suitable measurement locations in regions with lower local spatial variations...|$|E
