5|$|Most of {{the pottery}} found in 9th century pueblos was sized for {{individuals}} or small families, but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the 13th century, many larger, feast–sized vessels were produced. Corrugated decorations appear on Mesa Verde grey wares after 700, and by 1000 entire vessels were crafted in this way. The technique created a rough exterior surface that {{was easier to}} hold on to than regular grey wares, which were smooth. By the 11th century these corrugated vessels, which dissipated heat more efficiently than smoother ones, had largely replaced the older style, whose tendency to retain heat made them prone to boiling over. Corrugation likely developed as ancient potters attempted to mimic the visual properties of coiled basketry. Corrugated wares were made using clay from formations other than Menefee, which suggests that ancient potters selected different <b>clays</b> for different styles. Potters also selected <b>clays</b> and altered firing conditions to achieve specific colors. Under normal conditions, pots made of Mancos shale turned grey when fired, and those made of Morrison Formation clay turned white. <b>Clays</b> from southeastern Utah turned red when fired in a high-oxygen environment.|$|E

30|$|Expansibility {{is one of}} the {{important}} physical properties of <b>clay.</b> On the one hand, the porosity of <b>clay</b> deteriorates after <b>clay</b> absorbs water and expands making it relatively impermeable.

5|$|The Holderness {{landscape}} {{is dominated by}} deposits of till, boulder <b>clays</b> and glacial lake <b>clays.</b> These were deposited during the Devensian glaciation. The glacial deposits form {{a more or less}} continuous lowland plain which has some peat filled depressions (known locally as meres) which mark the presence of former lake beds. There are other glacial landscape features such as drumlin mounds, ridges and kettle holes scattered throughout the area. The well drained glacial deposits provide fertile soils that can support intensive arable cultivation. Fields are generally large and bounded by drainage ditches. There is very little woodland in the area and this leads to a landscape that is essentially rural but very flat and exposed.|$|E

30|$|The authigenic <b>clay</b> mineral cements are {{postulated}} to neo-formed from post-depositional, infiltrated allogenic <b>clay</b> minerals. Post-depositional <b>clay</b> infiltration by {{muddy water}} {{has been described as}} an effective mechanism to emplace allogenic <b>clay</b> mineral aggregates and allogenic <b>clay</b> mineral coats post-depositional into sand in arid and semiarid climates (Matlack et al. 1989; Moraes and de Ros 1990; Worden and Morad 2003; Ajdukiewicz et al. 2010). The allogenic <b>clay</b> minerals are infiltrated by meteoric water during rain or flood events into semi-consolidated sands (Worden and Morad 2003; McKie et al. 2010), where fractures and disaggregation bands increase the infiltration depth (Fig.  12). High amounts of infiltrated allogenic <b>clay</b> minerals resulted in thick allogenic <b>clay</b> mineral coatings, allogenic <b>clay</b> mineral bridges between <b>clay</b> mineral coatings and pore-filling allogenic <b>clay</b> mineral aggregates (Matlack et al. 1989; Moraes and de Ros 1990). Allogenic <b>clay</b> minerals tend to transform with ongoing burial and increasing temperatures along existing structures into authigenic chlorite and illite which led to present-day authigenic <b>clay</b> coatings (Fig.  8 b, c, d), pore-bridging <b>clay</b> structures and pore-filling <b>clay</b> aggregates (Fig.  8 f).|$|R

5|$|Houston is flat marshy {{area where}} an {{extensive}} drainage {{system has been}} built. The adjoining prairie land drains into the city which is prone to flooding. Underpinning Houston's land surface are unconsolidated <b>clays,</b> clay shales, and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep. The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from {{the erosion of the}} Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and <b>clays</b> deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{results were}} {{surprising}} as the material excavated {{by the impact}} contained more dust and less ice than had been expected. The only models of cometary structure astronomers could positively rule out were the very porous ones which had comets as loose aggregates of material. In addition, the material was finer than expected; scientists compared it to talcum powder rather than sand. Other materials found while studying the impact included <b>clays,</b> carbonates, sodium, and crystalline silicates which were found by studying the spectroscopy of the impact. <b>Clays</b> and carbonates usually require liquid water to form and sodium is rare in space. Observations also revealed that the comet was about 75% empty space, and one astronomer compared the outer layers of the comet to the same makeup of a snow bank. Astronomers have expressed interest in more missions to different comets {{to determine if they}} share similar compositions or if there are different materials found deeper within comets that were produced {{at the time of the}} Solar System's formation.|$|E
