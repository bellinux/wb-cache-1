The island has been involved in data processing since the 1980s and now specialises in operations such as database management and insurance <b>claims</b> <b>processing.</b> Costs in Barbados are higher than elsewhere in the Caribbean (although still only half of costs in the United States), but the island offers strong advantages such as a literate English-speaking workforce and location in the same time zone as the eastern United States. Despite these factors, employment has fallen in recent years, reflecting increasing mobility on the part of foreign companies, which frequently relocate to lower-cost areas.|$|E

Veterans advocacy organizations, researchers, clinicians, politicians, administrators, and citizens will no doubt continue to influence how the United States evaluates, adjudicates, and administers the program. For example, current efforts at change or reform include urging the VA to place more emphasis on vocational rehabilitation and treatment versus cash payments; revising the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders to better reflect problems experienced by veterans with PTSD; establishing a balance between efforts to decrease <b>claims</b> <b>processing</b> time (productivity) {{with the need for}} consistency and accuracy of examination results and rating decisions (quality); and considering a veteran's quality of life as a factor in determining the disability rating.|$|E

500|$|Although Gore {{was well}} {{received}} by the British establishment, the work suffered from what Gore called a [...] "tediousness of process", and he considered requesting a transfer in 1798. In 1800 it {{ground to a halt}} because another board established by the treaty to resolve outstanding Revolutionary War claims against the United States had not yet met, and the British stopped the <b>claims</b> <b>processing</b> until resolution of the other issues got underway. Gore used this break to briefly return to America and assess the condition of his Waltham estate, where the house had been largely destroyed by fire in 1799. After his return to London, with the commission work still stopped, he and Rebecca embarked on a tour of Europe. [...] They visited Holland, Belgium, and Switzerland, and spent six months in Paris.

40|$|In this paper, we aim {{to verify}} and {{quantify}} the challenges of patent <b>claim</b> <b>processing</b> that {{have been identified in}} the literature. We focus on the following three challenges that, judging from the numbers of mentions in papers concerning patent analysis and patent retrieval, are central to patent claim processing: (1) The length of sentences is much longer than for general language use; (2) Many novel terms are introduced in patent claims that are difficult to understand; (3) The syntactic structure of patent claims is complex. We find that the challenges of patent <b>claim</b> <b>processing</b> that are related to syntactic structure are much more problematic than the challenges at the vocabulary level. The sentence length issue only causes problems indirectly by resulting in more structural ambiguities for longer noun phrases...|$|R

40|$|The growing {{interdependence}} in {{the world}} and the increasing number of refugees has made public policy in this area one of the key challenges facing nations today. A number of countries have introduced policies aimed at deterring non-genuine refugee claims. Canada is lagging behind in developing solutions to its growing refugee problems, namely large backlogs and growing number of applications. This study identifies the challenges of Canada’s current inland refugee system to recommend policy options to reduce incentives for abuse by non-genuine claimants. Using a comparative case study analysis of Australia, the UK, and Sweden, it provides policy recommendations on how these can be addressed. The analysis shows that streamlining procedures, having one agency responsible for <b>claim</b> <b>processing,</b> and the provision of social benefits being tied to a claimant’s compliance with <b>claim</b> <b>processing</b> lead to an efficient refugee determination system. The policy options proposed focus on these policies as they have been successful in other countries but are missing in Canada. Designating all refugee claim-processing matters to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada is presented as the best of the three policy alternatives...|$|R

40|$|Business process {{management}} in service-oriented computing (SOC) environments poses special challenges. In particular, SOC environments are dynamic, thereby requiring frequent changes in business processes. Current business process modeling approaches handle such changes {{in an ad}} hoc manner, and lack a principled means of determining {{what needs to be}} changed and where. This paper addresses process adaptability through a novel application of business protocols, especially of protocol composition, introduced in our previous work. Through a real business scenario of auto-insurance <b>claim</b> <b>processing,</b> this paper demonstrates how a wide range of adaptations can be handled naturally and systematically via protocol composition. The illustrated adaptations have been evaluated via a prototype. 1...|$|R

40|$|Patent corpus {{processing}} {{should be}} cen-tered around patent <b>claim</b> <b>processing</b> be-cause <b>claims</b> {{are the most}} important part in patent specifications. It is common that claims written in Japanese are described in one sentence with peculiar style and word-ing and are difficult to understand for ordi-nary people. The peculiarity is caused by structural complexity of the sentences and many difficult terms used in the descrip-tion. We have already proposed a frame-work to represent the structure of patent claims and a method to automatically an-alyze it. We are currently investigating a method to clarify terms in patent claims and to find the explanatory portions from the detailed description part of the patent specifications. Through both approaches, we believe we can improve readability of patent claims. ...|$|R
