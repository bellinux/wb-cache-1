40|$|Stratocumulus {{cloud cover}} {{patterns}} {{and their relationship}} to drizzle were characterized at San Felix Island (SFI: 26. 5 °S, 80 °W) in the Southeast Pacific. Small closed, large <b>closed</b> and open <b>cells</b> were identified in about 65 % of the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) satellite images during 2003. The MODIS imagery was combined with ceilometer and surface meteorological measurements, human observations of cloud types and drizzle, and large-scale meteorological analyses for January through June. We identified two drizzle regimes: a synoptically-quiescent summer (Jan-March) regime characterized by a strong anticyclone, large <b>closed</b> <b>cells,</b> and frequent drizzle, and an autumn (April-June) regime characterized by a weaker anticyclone, small <b>closed</b> <b>cells</b> and open cells, and precipitation that was mainly associated with synoptic activity. The large <b>closed</b> <b>cells</b> had higher mean cloud bases and tops than the small <b>closed</b> <b>cells,</b> accounted for 45 % of the cumulus-under- stratocumulus reports, and 29 % of the total drizzle and rain reports. Large <b>closed</b> <b>cells</b> occupied more intermittently-coupled boundary layers than did the small <b>closed</b> <b>cells.</b> Open cells also occurred in more decoupled conditions, but only accounted for 18 % of the total reports of drizzle and rain. The atmospheric stability of large and small <b>closed</b> <b>cells</b> were similar, but large <b>closed</b> <b>cells</b> were more commonly associated with a strong anticyclone, and small <b>closed</b> <b>cells</b> with wave activity superimposed upon a weakened anticyclone. The increased drizzle and occurrence of cumulus-under-stratocumulus in the summer rather than autumn is consistent with higher nighttime liquid water paths. A contribution of this study is the documentation {{of the ways in which}} synoptic activity can affect stratocumulus decks...|$|R

25|$|Surfactants {{are used}} in {{polyurethane}} foams to emulsify the liquid components, regulate cell size, and stabilize the cell structure to prevent collapse and surface defects. Rigid foam surfactants are designed to produce very fine cells and a very high <b>closed</b> <b>cell</b> content. Flexible foam surfactants are designed to stabilize the reaction mass {{while at the same}} time maximizing open cell content to prevent the foam from shrinking.|$|E
25|$|Neoprene {{dry suits}} {{are made from}} a foam-rubber sheet {{containing}} tiny air bubbles, which provide insulation by themselves, and can {{eliminate the need for}} an under-suit, or greatly reduce the thickness needed for the under-fabric, but the bubbles in the neoprene are compressed and the insulation of the suit decreases with depth {{in the same way as}} for a wetsuit. Crushed neoprene provides the flexibility of neoprene with the consistent buoyancy and insulation of membrane suits. A neoprene wet suit can also be worn under a membrane dry suit for extra protection against condensation and leaks, but it will compress with depth as will any <b>closed</b> <b>cell</b> suit.|$|E
500|$|Colony {{founding}} {{is mostly}} initiated by a fertilised worker that establishes {{herself in a}} <b>closed</b> <b>cell,</b> from which she sometimes emerges to forage for food. Observations show that most workers establishing their own colonies follow the typical behaviour of a Ponerine ant, laying eggs and rearing their larvae. However, the brood in captive colonies founded by workers only emerges as males. Such a case would mean that a new colony is probably formed {{by a number of}} workers leaving their parent nest, of which a few individuals are fertilised. This process is called budding, also called [...] "satelliting" [...] or [...] "fractionating", where a subset of the colony leave the main colony for an alternative nest site. This may not be the case entirely, as some queens can establish their own colonies. Inseminated queens can successfully establish a colony in non-claustral, haplometrotic ...|$|E

Further lipid evolution leads to self-supporting lipid membranes and <b>closed</b> <b>cells.</b> The earliest <b>closed</b> <b>cells</b> are pre-cells (sensu Kandler) because they allow frequent exchange of genetic material (e.g. by fusions). According to Woese, this frequent exchange of genetic material is the cause {{for the existence of}} the common stem in the tree of life and for a very rapid early evolution.|$|R

2500|$|Electrolysis {{cells can}} be either open cell or <b>closed</b> <b>cell.</b> In open cell systems, the {{electrolysis}} products, which are gaseous, are allowed to leave the cell. In <b>closed</b> <b>cell</b> experiments, the products are captured, for example by catalytically recombining the products in a separate part of the experimental system. These experiments generally strive for a steady state condition, with the electrolyte being replaced periodically. There are also [...] "heat-after-death" [...] experiments, where the evolution of heat is monitored after the electric current is turned off.|$|E
2500|$|Conventional {{ballasted}} tunnel-track {{was ruled}} out {{owing to the}} difficulty of maintenance and lack of stability and precision. [...] The Sonneville International Corporation's track system was chosen based on reliability and cost-effectiveness based on good performance in Swiss tunnels and worldwide. The type of track used is known as Low Vibration Track (LVT). Like ballasted track the LVT is of the free floating type, held in place by gravity and friction. Reinforced concrete blocks of 100kg support the rails every 60cm and are held by 12mm thick <b>closed</b> <b>cell</b> polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of rubber boots. The latter separate the blocks' mass movements from the lean encasement concrete. Ballastless track provides extra overhead clearance necessary for the passage of larger trains. The corrugated rubber walls of the boots add a degree of isolation of horizontal wheel-rail vibrations, and are insulators of the track signal circuit in the humid tunnel environment. UIC60 (60kg/m) rails of 900A grade rest on [...] rail pads, which fit the RN/Sonneville bolted dual leaf-springs. The rails, LVT-blocks and their boots with pads were assembled outside the tunnel, in a fully automated process developed by the LVT inventor, Mr. Roger Sonneville. About 334,000 Sonneville blocks were made on the Sangatte site.|$|E

In 2002, {{he told the}} New York Times that he woke up in a Phoenix hotel room with no memory of having driven from Los Angeles. [...] "It was two days before his 38th birthday. Still, he continued to spiral downward, at times sitting at home for hours without saying a word.

[...] "If there is someone fighting within you, it makes your life unbearable," [...] he said. [...] "Anger has to be converted into something else or it destroys you." [...] He said that a major help in his recovery was his belief in God. He has criticised atheism, saying in 2011 that [...] "being an atheist must be like living in a <b>closed</b> <b>cell</b> with no windows". In an interview with Larry King in 2016, Hopkins described himself as an agnostic and said he believed in a [...] "superior consciousness in all of us". He gave up smoking using the Allen Carr method. In 2008, he embarked on a weight loss program, and by 2010, he had lost 80 pounds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{precursor of}} the Mistral-C Club Class glider was the Strauber Mistral high performance Standard Class aircraft designed by Manfred Strauber, Alois Fries, Hartmut Frommhold and Horst Gaber. [...] Design works began in January 1970 and the Mistral {{made its first}} flight in July 1975. [...] It {{was not intended to}} be serially produced. It was a 15.00m (49ft2.5in) span shoulder wing monoplane with a T-tail which made much use of glass reinforced plastic (GRP) in its structure. [...] The wings had an area of 9.40m² (101.2sqft), an aspect ratio of 23.9 and sweepback at one quarter chord of 0.4°. The dihedral was also 0.4°. The airfoil sections used were Wortmann FX-66-S-196 at the root and FX-66-S-161 at the tips. [...] The wings were constructed from GRP/balsa sandwich with ailerons of GRP and rigid, <b>closed</b> <b>cell,</b> polymethacrylimide (PMI) foam. [...] Aluminium Schempp-Hirth airbrakes extended from the upper wing surface only. The tail unit, with an all-moving tailplane, was also formed from PMI filled GRP. The fuselage of the Mistral was a pod and boom monocoque made from GRP/balsa sandwich, with the single seat cockpit under a single piece, framed canopy. [...] Its main, single landing wheel was manually retractable and assisted by a tailskid. The Mistral had a best glide angle of 39:1 and a minimum sink speed of 0.6m/s (118ft/mim).|$|E

50|$|In some modern {{paragliders}} (from the 1990s onwards), especially higher-performance wings, some of {{the cells}} of the leading edge are closed to form a cleaner aerodynamic profile.

40|$|International audienceThe dynamic {{structure}} of the atmospheric marine boundary layer (MBL) supports two distinct states of cloud cover: closed and open Benard cellular convection. <b>Closed</b> <b>cells</b> are nearly fully cloud covered, while the open cells have < 40 % cloud cover. Here we show that aerosols have a greater than expected impact on the cloud cover by changing the mode of cellular convection. By suppressing precipitation aerosols can reverse {{the direction of the}} airflow, converting the cloud structure from open to <b>closed</b> <b>cells</b> and doubling the cloud cover. The two states possess positive feedbacks for self maintenance, so that small changes of the conditions can lead to bifurcation of the MBL cloud regime. The transition occurs at near pristine background level of aerosols, creating a large sensitivity of cloud radiative forcing to very small changes in aerosols at the MBL. This can {{have a major impact on}} global temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Fiedler (1985) {{demonstrates}} {{the inadequacy of}} three convective instability theories in explaining the large aspect ratio of mesoscale cellular convec-tion (MCC). As an alternative explanation, he suggests mesoscale entrainment instability (MEI), an instability resulting from the entrainment fluxes {{at the top of}} the mixed layer. Fiedler uses the acronym MCC to designate “the cellular cloud pattern in marine strato-cumulus cloud decks”, i. e. <b>closed</b> convection <b>cells.</b> In fact, “Mesoscale cellular convection ” was first used by Hubert (1966) as a collective name for open as well as <b>closed</b> convection <b>cells</b> (see also Agee (1984) for some nice examples). Nowhere does Fiedler allude to the large differences between open and <b>closed</b> <b>cells.</b> Cloud cover in open cells may be only 10 %. while Fiedler assumes 100 % cloud cover. Since a coupling between entrainment and conden-sation of water vapour is definitely necessary for the occurrence of ME 1 (Fiedler. 1984. p. 98). it is very doubtful whether ME 1 can explain the existence, let alone the structure and large aspect ratio, of open cells. The conditional nature of latent heat release seems to be a much better candidate (Van Delden, 1985). To me it even seems doubtful that ME 1 can explain the large aspect ratio of <b>closed</b> <b>cells</b> with a cloud cover close to 100 %. This can be seen from eq. (3. 22) (Fiedler, 1985) which gives the small-scale cut-off. According to this equation ME 1 occurs only whe...|$|R
