5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and euryhaline fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including tilapia (genus Oreochromis and Tilapia), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and barramundi (Lates calcarifer, which can be an asymptomatic carrier). <b>Common</b> <b>carp</b> (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. Wild fish populations located both near and far from aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle {{is listed}} under the marine and migratory {{categories}} which give it protected status under Australia's federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. As a mainly coastal species, it {{is vulnerable to}} habitat destruction in Australia's increasingly populated and urbanised coastal areas, particularly {{in the south and}} east of the country, where it appears to have declined in numbers. However, there may have been an increase in population inland, secondary to the creation of reservoirs, dams and weirs, and the spread of the introduced <b>common</b> <b>carp</b> (Cyprinus carpio). However, it is rare along the Murray River where it was once common. It is also listed as Threatened under Victoria's Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988), with possibly fewer than 100 breeding pairs remaining in the state. On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the white-bellied sea eagle is listed as vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|The thick {{shell and}} rounded shape of {{bivalves}} make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of demersal fish feed on them including the <b>common</b> <b>carp</b> (Cyprinus carpio), which is being used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells. The herring gull (Larus argentatus) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones balanced on their chests as anvils on which to crack open the shells. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{is one of the main}} predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth.|$|E

40|$|Fish-borne trematodes are {{reported}} to affect the health of more than 40 million people worldwide. Few experimental studies are available on fish size dependent gain (attack rates of cercariae) or loss (mortality of metacercariae) of fish-borne trematodes. Aim was to quantify the relation between fish size and attack rates of fish-borne trematodes in <b>common</b> <b>carps</b> (Cyprinus carpio). Effect of fish size and cercariae dose were tested in a 3 × 4 factorial design with 5 fish per combination of treatments (n = 60). Individually kept small (1 g), medium (25 g) and large (45 g) carps were exposed to 0, 10, 50 or 250 parapleurolophocercous-cercariae (Heterophyidae) for 48 h. Fish were digested 21 days post exposure to count metacercariae. Percentages of fish containing metacercariae, and attack rates of cercariae to fish were higher (63 %, 0. 08 fish infected per cercariae) for small <b>common</b> <b>carps</b> than for medium (20 %, 0. 004 fish infected per cercariae) and large <b>common</b> <b>carps</b> (5 %, 0. 0007 fish infected per cercariae), but never zero.

25|$|Several exotic {{freshwater}} fish species, including brown, brook and rainbow trout, Atlantic and Chinook salmon, redfin perch, <b>common</b> <b>carp,</b> and mosquitofish, {{have been introduced}} to Australian waterways. The mosquitofish is a particularly aggressive species known for harassing and nipping the fins of other fish.

The introduced trout species have had serious negative impacts on a number of upland native fish species including trout cod, Macquarie perch and mountain galaxias species as well as other upland fauna such as the spotted tree frog. The <b>common</b> <b>carp</b> is strongly implicated in the dramatic loss in waterweed, decline of small native fish species and permanently elevated levels of turbidity in the Murray-Darling Basin of south west Australia.|$|E

40|$|In {{the late}} forties the {{freshwater}} Mediterranean Vransko lake was stocked with <b>common</b> <b>carps</b> (97, 5 % mirror ones of farm origin and 2, 5 % scaled ones of river origin). The 122 carps (52 females and 70 males) from that lake were collected {{for this research}} in 1979 and 1982. The 120 were scaled and only two lined, all being between 2 + and 11 +. The condition coefficients (K) varied between 1, 15 and 1, 40 and the standard length - maximum height ratio was 3, 01 ± 0, 19.

50|$|In Utah, the <b>common</b> <b>carp's</b> {{population}} in Utah Lake {{is expected to}} be reduced by 75 percent by using nets to catch millions of them and either give them to people who will eat them or processing them into fertilizer. This, in turn, will give the native June sucker a chance to recover its declining population. Another method is by trapping them in tributaries they use to spawn with seine nets and exposing them to rotenone. This method has shown to reduce their impact within 24 hours and greatly increase the native vegetation and desirable fish species.

25|$|Several {{cyprinids}} {{have been}} introduced to waters outside their natural ranges to provide food, sport, or biological control for some pest species. The <b>common</b> <b>carp</b> (Cyprinus carpio) and the grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) {{are the most important}} of these, for example in Florida. In some cases, such as the Asian carp in the Mississippi Basin, they have become invasive species that compete with native fishes or disrupt the environment. Carp in particular can stir up sediment, reducing the clarity of the water and making it difficult for plants to grow.|$|E
25|$|Eutrophication {{may cause}} {{competitive}} release by making abundant a normally limiting nutrient. This process causes {{shifts in the}} species composition of ecosystems.

In Europe and Asia, the <b>common</b> <b>carp</b> frequently lives in naturally Eutrophic or Hypereutrophic areas, and is adapted to living in such conditions. The eutrophication of areas outside its natural range partially explain the fish's success in colonising these areas after being introduced.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the brown}} pelican (P. occidentalis), the American white pelican does not dive for its food. Instead it catches its prey while swimming. Each bird eats more than 4 pounds of food a day, mostly fish such as Cypriniformes like <b>Common</b> <b>carp</b> (Cyprinus carpio), Lahontan Tui chub (Gila bicolor obesa) and shiners, Perciformes like Sacramento perch (Archoplites interruptus) or Yellow perch (Perca flavescens), Salmoniformes like Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Siluriformes (catfish), and jackfish. Other animals eaten by these birds are {{crayfish}} and amphibians, and sometimes larval salamanders. Birds nesting on saline lakes, where food is scarce, will travel great distances to better feeding grounds.|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of uncoupling protein (UCP 1) is up-regulated in mammalian brown adipocytes during cold exposure. However, {{a previous study}} revealed that UCP 1 was highly expressed in the liver of <b>common</b> <b>carps,</b> and that the hepatic {{expression of}} UCP 1 was down-regulated during cold exposure. The present study {{examined the effects of}} temperature on the recovery of UCP 1 expression levels and the expression of genes involved in UCP 1 transcription in the livers and kidneys of <b>common</b> <b>carps.</b> The hepatic and renal expressions of UCP 1 were decreased by acclimation from 22 °C to 8 °C, and a subsequent increase in the water temperature from 8 °C to 28 °C recovered the renal, but not hepatic expression of UCP 1. Changes in the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor (PPAR) γ, retinoid X receptor (RXR) α and PPARγ co-activator (PGC) - 1 α, genes that are involved in the expression of UCP 1 in mammals, with ambient temperature indicated that the expressions of PPARγ and RXRα, but not expression of PGC- 1 α was decreased in response to cold exposure; the hepatic and renal expressions of PPARγ and RXRα recovered to basal levels with the cessation of cold exposure, although this was not complete for hepatic expression of PPARγ. The {{results of the present study}} indicate that a unique regulatory mechanism is responsible for the hepatic and renal expressions of carp UCP 1 during cold exposure and subsequent reacclimation, and is distinct from that in murine brown adipocytes...|$|R
40|$|Even {{with the}} aide of modern technology, {{the search for}} cadaver or human remains {{underwater}} is still assisted by sniffer dogs mainly because of their superior sense of olfaction. However, dogs rely on volatile organic compounds {{in the air and}} that this may constraint their ability when searching for submerged cadavers. On the other hand, it has long been recognized that fishes use olfaction to sample odors from their surroundings to accomplish a task and are capable of acquiring new skills through training or conditioning. Despite decades of experimental and observational studies of the olfactory sensitivities of fishes, its potential application to forensic sciences has never been truly explored. In this pioneering research, we explore the possibility of using fish olfaction in detecting cadaver odors (porcine origin), using <b>common</b> <b>carps</b> Cyprinus carpio as model species in a series of experiments under laboratory conditions. We first observed the innate behavior of carps towards cadaver odors. Afterwards, the carps were trained in two-choice chamber experimental tanks by appetitive olfactory conditioning and odor masking methods. We also experimented on the effects of cadaver odors by early exposure using eggs and larval impregnation techniques, and observing the behaviors when they develop to early juveniles. In general, we found out that <b>common</b> <b>carps</b> are naturally repelled to cadaver odors. However using our devised conditioning protocol, results show that the conditioned carps were able to learn to be attracted to cadaver odors despite their innate aversion. The development of fish for cadaver detection is a simple but innovative idea and that it may present a cost-effective and reliable solution for the shortcomings of the existing methods in underwater cadaver search. We anticipate that this research will open up a variety of different studies in pursuit of developing fishes as biosensors and its application to forensic sciences. Peer reviewe...|$|R

25|$|DNA {{microarray}} {{studies done}} on different fish species exposed to low-oxygen conditions {{have shown that}} at the genetic level fish respond to hypoxia by changing the expression of genes involved in oxygen transport, ATP production, and protein synthesis. In the liver of mudsuckers exposed to hypoxia there were changes in the expression of genes involved in heme metabolism such as hemopexin, heme oxygenase 1, and ferritin. Changes in the sequestration and metabolism of iron may suggest hypoxia induced erythropoiesis and increased demand for hemoglobin synthesis, leading to increased oxygen uptake and transport. Increased expression of myoglobin, which is normally only found in muscle tissue, has also been observed after hypoxia exposure in the gills of zebrafish and in non-muscle tissue of the <b>common</b> <b>carp</b> suggesting increased oxygen transport throughout fish tissues.|$|E
