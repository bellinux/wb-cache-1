Scully successfully resuscitates Lisa. Jason confronts his elderly self in the computer mainframe room at the cryogenic lab, where the old man has erased all of Jason's files from the computer. The old man tells Jason that the success of their research made time travel possible, but also plunged the world into chaos. Jason lunges at the old man, choking him. Wrapping his arms around his younger self, the old man bursts into flames, and the fire consumes them both. Later, Lisa sets to work at the <b>cryonics</b> lab, attempting to reconstruct the chemical compound.|$|E
5|$|Moxon {{represented}} manager Ken Hoden of the Church of Scientology's Golden Era Productions in February 1998 when {{he filed}} {{a restraining order}} against Keith Henson after Henson protested against Scientology in May 1997 and January 1998 outside the Golden Era film studios in Gilman Hot Springs, California. Moxon had argued that Henson was dangerous based on comments critical of Scientologists he had posted on the Internet, and his knowledge in the fields of <b>cryonics</b> and explosives. Hoden received a temporary restraining order against Henson, but the Riverside Superior Court judge refused to make the restraining order permanent.|$|E
5|$|Jason X (2002) marked Kane Hodder's last {{performance}} as Jason. The film starts off in 2010; Jason has returned after another unexplained resurrection. Captured by the U.S. government in 2008, Jason is being experimented upon {{in a research}} facility, {{where it has been}} determined that he has regenerative capabilities and that cryonic suspension is the only possible solution to stop him, since numerous attempts to execute him have proved unsuccessful. Jason escapes, killing all but one of his captors, and slices through the cryo-chamber, spilling <b>cryonics</b> fluid into the room, freezing himself and the only other survivor, Rowan (Lexa Doig). A team of students 445 years later discover Jason's body. On the team's spacecraft, Jason thaws from his cryonic suspension and begins killing the crew. Along the way, he is enhanced by a regenerative nanotechnology process, which gives him an impenetrable metal body. Finally, he is ejected into space and falls to the planet Earth 2, burning in the atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cryonics</b> is {{regarded}} with skepticism within the mainstream scientific community {{and is not}} part of normal medical practice. It is not known if it will ever be possible to revive a cryopreserved human being. <b>Cryonics</b> depends on beliefs that the <b>cryonics</b> patient has not experienced information-theoretic death. Such views are at the speculative edge of medicine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryonics</b> is the {{low-temperature}} {{preservation of}} humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, {{with the hope}} that healing and resuscitation may be possible in the future. <b>Cryonics</b> procedures ideally begin within minutes of cardiac arrest, and use cryoprotectants to prevent ice formation during cryopreservation. However, the idea of <b>cryonics</b> also includes preservation of people long after death because of the possibility that brain encoding memory structure and personality may still persist or be inferable in the future. Whether sufficient brain information still exists for <b>cryonics</b> to successfully preserve may be intrinsically unprovable by present knowledge. Therefore, most proponents of <b>cryonics</b> see it as an intervention with prospects for success that vary widely depending on circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Money {{generated}} by the non-profit Life Extension Foundation allowed Saul Kent to finance the Alcor Life Extension Foundation, the world's largest <b>cryonics</b> organization. The <b>cryonics</b> movement had been launched in 1962 by Robert Ettinger's book, The Prospect of Immortality. In the 1960s, Saul Kent had been a co-founder of the <b>Cryonics</b> Society of New York. Alcor gained national prominence when baseball star Ted Williams was cryonically preserved by Alcor in 2002 and a family dispute arose as to whether Williams had {{really wanted to be}} cryopreserved.|$|E

25|$|For several decades, {{researchers}} have also pursued various forms of suspended animation as {{a means by which}} to indefinitely extend mammalian lifespan. Some scientists have voiced support for the feasibility of the cryopreservation of humans, known as <b>cryonics.</b> <b>Cryonics</b> is predicated on the concept that some people considered clinically dead by today's medicolegal standards are not actually dead according to information-theoretic death and can, in principle, be resuscitated given sufficient technological advances. The goal of current <b>cryonics</b> procedures is tissue vitrification, a technique first used to reversibly cryopreserve a viable whole organ in 2005.|$|E

25|$|As {{proponents of}} self-improvement and body modification, {{including}} gender transitioning, transhumanists {{tend to use}} existing technologies and techniques that supposedly improve cognitive and physical performance, while engaging in routines and lifestyles designed to improve health and longevity.

However, many have a great interest in life extension strategies and in funding research in <b>cryonics</b> {{in order to make the}} latter a viable option of last resort, rather than remaining an unproven method. Regional and global transhumanist networks and communities with a range of objectives exist to provide support and forums for discussion and collaborative projects.|$|E

25|$|Anna plays only a {{very minor}} role {{in the story of}} the first game, {{appearing}} as a sub-boss character for Nina. Her story was further expanded in later games. In Tekken 2, as in the first tournament, the 20-year-old Nina was once again hired to assassinate the sponsor of the current tournament, Kazuya Mishima. Whether at Kazuya's discretion or Anna's own volition, Anna became a bodyguard for Kazuya, along with Ganryu and Bruce Irvin, who were all charged with Kazuya's protection. Nina was later captured by Mishima Zaibatsu forces and used in Dr. Bosconovitch's <b>cryonics</b> research. Learning about this, Anna volunteered to be another test subject, requesting that she be woken in the future {{at the same time as}} Nina. Her reason for doing this is unknown, but the two most reasonable explanations would be because she didn't want to feel lonely without Nina, and she didn't wanted her sister's age preserved in a cryonic sleep while she herself continues to age.|$|E
25|$|Batman Annual #1 {{introduces}} a new origin for Mr. Freeze. Here, Victor Fries' fascination with <b>cryonics</b> {{began when he}} was a boy and his mother fell through the ice of a frozen lake. The ice was able to keep her preserved long enough for help to arrive, thus sparking his lifelong obsession with the cold. It is later revealed that the accident left Fries' mother in constant pain, and Fries ended her suffering by pushing her into the same frozen lake. In this new origin, Nora was never Fries' wife. Her name was Nora Fields, a woman born in 1943. When Nora was 23, she was diagnosed with an incurable heart disease, so her family placed her in cryogenic stasis hoping that a cure would be found in the future. Fries, having written his doctoral thesis on Nora, took on a position as a cryogenic researcher and technician at Wayne Enterprises, the facility that housed Nora's body.|$|E
500|$|Homer takes Bart's sons to a <b>cryonics</b> {{facility}} where Grampa has been frozen alive {{to prevent a}} disease from killing him. Although a cure has now been discovered, he is kept frozen by Homer because it is cheaper than paying for a nursing home and because Grampa has constantly been rude to him. Homer says to the boys that they should give their father another chance, since he knows Bart loves them. At that point, Bart arrives and apologizes to his sons, admitting how much he treasures them. Touched, the two boys forgive him for not having included them [...] in his life much, while an inspired Homer decides to unfreeze Grampa and forgive him as well. Meanwhile, Lisa goes into the Ultranet to find Zia and discovers a door leading into Zia's private world. Entering it, Lisa is overjoyed to find that Zia has hung a poster of her next {{to a series of}} posters depicting historical women who have made a difference in the world. When Zia arrives, Lisa thanks her for looking up to her and the two reconcile at last, and secretly hides her life as a party poser. With the conflicts resolved, Bart and Lisa gather their children in preparation for a new Christmas family photo. Marge arrives with Maggie, who has given birth to a baby girl. The Simpsons gather into a group just as the family pets (who have evolved greatly over the past thirty years) take the new photo.|$|E
