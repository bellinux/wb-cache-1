5|$|In June, the ZNDH finally {{received}} from Germany the long-promised airdrop <b>containers</b> <b>for</b> aerial resupply of ammunition and other equipment, constantly in need by besieged and encircled garrisons {{all over the}} NDH.

June also saw Kren returned to his previous position as head of the ZNDH.|$|E

5|$|Roy faced {{challenges}} {{before entering}} college. His parents {{and his older}} brother had not attended college, and due to a learning disability Roy had difficulty with the SAT; his reading comprehension was slow, which increased the time he needed for tests. He had taken the test four times (with tutors) before finally meeting the NCAA requirements. Unsure whether {{he would be able to}} attend a four-year college, Roy worked on the Seattle docks, cleaning shipping <b>containers</b> <b>for</b> $11/hour.|$|E
5|$|Seed is {{gathered}} from natural forest and plantations, most collectors being {{descendants of the}} original settlers. Seed is then germinated in soil-less media and sealed from the atmosphere to prevent contamination. After testing they are picked, washed (bare-rooted), sanitised and certified then packed and sealed into insulated <b>containers</b> <b>for</b> export. They grow both indoors and out and are popular for hotels and motels worldwide. Nursery profits are returned to enhance the island ecosystem. The nursery plans to expand the business to include the curly palm and other native plants of special interest.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of clothes}} moths (mainly Tineola bisselliella and Tinea pellionella) feed on fabrics and carpets, {{particularly}} those that are stored or soiled. The adult females lay batches of eggs on natural fibres, including wool, silk and fur, as well as cotton and linen in blends. The developing larvae spin protective webbing and chew into the fabric, creating holes and specks of excrement. Damage is often concentrated in concealed locations, under collars and near seams of clothing, in folds and crevices in upholstery and round the edges of carpets as well as under furniture. Methods of control include using airtight <b>containers</b> <b>for</b> storage, periodic laundering of garments, trapping, freezing, heating {{and the use of}} chemicals; mothballs contain volatile insect repellents such as 1,4-Dichlorobenzene which deter adults, but to kill the larvae, permethrin, pyrethroids or other insecticides may need to be used.|$|E

5|$|The {{ski jumping}} venue {{took place at}} Ještěd which has two hills that were already to FIS specifications. The normal hill size (HS) was 100m (HS100) while the large hill size was 134m (HS134). Both hills were used for FIS ski jumping World Cup venues with Finnish ski jumper Janne Ahonen holding the record jump of 139m on the HS134 hill in 2004. Modifications were done to the outrun and data was {{gathered}} on the wind flow within the ski jumping area from January to March for 2006 to 2009. At the fall 2007 meeting in Zurich {{during the week of}} 24 September 2007, it was announced by the Organizing Committee that construction was proceeding according to schedule, with completion in mid-December 2007. The test event for Jested took place on 8–9 February 2008. A grandstand of 10,000 spectators was constructed in order to have night time ski jumping the weekend of 9–10 February 2008. The hill suffered a landslide caused by continuous rainfall around the hill during the week of 28 January 2008, but the outrun was not affected by the event, according to Liberec mayor Jiri Kittner. On 1 February, Neumannová stated that the ski jumping events took place as scheduled. The lift to the ski jump that was not working during the FIS World Cup B Nordic combined event in January was fixed. The winners of the ski jumping test event at the HS134 hill were Thomas Morgenstern of Austria on 8 February and Anders Jacobsen of Norway on 9 February. An Alpen Cup competition took place on the weekend of 20–21 December 2008 to have final test procedures and infrastructure for the championships. As of 14 January 2009, the main grandstand was complete while the teams worked on proper shaping of the hills for use. The large hill was closed while the normal hill was designated for ski jumper and Nordic combined athlete training. Further construction during the week of 19 January 2009 included spectator stairs {{on the side of the}} hill, mobile <b>containers</b> <b>for</b> the athletes and their service teams; and a spectator catering tent was set up.|$|E
