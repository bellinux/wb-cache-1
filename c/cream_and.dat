30|$|In this study, sixty-two (62) skin-lightening <b>creams</b> <b>and</b> soaps were {{analysed}} for total mercury and hydroquinone levels. Total mercury {{was determined by}} the Cold Vapour Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry using an automatic mercury analyser and hydroquinone by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. The mean concentration of total mercury in skin toning <b>creams</b> <b>and</b> cosmetic soaps were 0.098  ±  0.082 and 0.152  ±  0.126  μg/g, respectively. The mean concentration of hydroquinone was 0.243  ±  0.385 and 0.035  ±  0.021  % in skin toning <b>creams</b> <b>and</b> cosmetic soaps, respectively. All the <b>creams</b> <b>and</b> soaps analysed had mercury and hydroquinone levels below the US Food and Drug Administration’s acceptable limit of 1  μg/g and 2  %, respectively. The low levels of mercury and hydroquinone in the <b>creams</b> <b>and</b> soaps analysed in this study therefore do not pose any potential risk to consumers who are mostly women in Ghana.|$|R

30|$|Most of {{the skins}} {{lightening}} <b>creams</b> <b>and</b> soaps on the Ghanaian market are imported from USA, Europe, Italy and Cote d’Voire (Voegborlo et al. 2008). The demand for skin-lightening products in Ghana {{is on the}} increase despite the health hazards {{associated with the use}} of these products. However, data on mercury and hydroquinone levels in skin-lightening soaps <b>and</b> <b>creams</b> sold on the Ghanaian market are lacking and only little work has been done on mercury (Voegborlo et al. 2008) even though concerns have been raised on the negative effect of skin-lightening <b>creams</b> <b>and</b> soaps on the skin. The aim of this work was to analyse the mercury and hydroquinone content in some skin toning <b>creams</b> <b>and</b> cosmetic soaps using automatic mercury analyser coupled with Cold Vapour Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (CV-AAS) and High Performance Liquid Chromatography.|$|R
