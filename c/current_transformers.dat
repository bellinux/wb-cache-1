40|$|There is {{ever-increasing}} {{demand in}} telecommunication system, data server and computer equipment for low voltage, high current power supply. LLC resonant converter {{is a good}} topology on primary side of the converter because it has soft switching and resonant conversion. However, the passive rectifier in the secondary side has high power dissipation. Synchronous rectifier is a popular method to reduce this rectification loss. Although there are many types of synchronous rectifier for PWM converter, {{most of them do}} not function well in LLC resonant converters. It is because the wave form of LLC resonant converter is different from PWM. The objective of this research is to reduce the power dissipation and physical size at the same time. In this thesis, a novel current driven synchronous rectifier with saturable <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> and dynamic gate voltage control for LLC resonant Converter is presented. This novel circuit reduces the rectification loss and size of the <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> in the synchronous rectifier. This synchronous rectifier has several outstanding characteristics compared with generic voltage driven and current driven synchronous rectifier. The saturable feature reduces the <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> turns. Inherent dynamic gate voltage controlled by saturable <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> reduces gate loss in the MOSFET. A novel driving circuit is proposed for accurate turn off time. It reduces loss significantly. This synchronous rectifier is completely self-contained which can replace the rectifier diode as a drop in replacement. It is insensitive to parasitic inductance. In order to explain the <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> saturable, a model of saturable <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> is proposed. A prototype demonstrates the advantages of the proposed current driven synchronous rectifier. Furthermore, a novel integrated synchronous rectifier is presented which provides a more compact system. The synchronous rectifier <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> is integrated with the main transformer which reduces the number of circuit joints in power path. Each soldering joint generates significance loss in power converter. A pair of 0. 5 mΩ soldering joint in 25 A current path produces 0. 62 W loss. The placement of the integrated <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> is important. A criterion for the placement of the <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> within the main transformer is to avoid interference to the <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> from the magnetic flux of the main transformer.
