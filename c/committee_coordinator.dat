Following a widely publicized wave of UFO reports in 1966, NICAP was among the chorus which called for an independent scientific investigation of UFOs.

This should always be completed prior to implementation or evaluation; however, keeping the end in mind (how will I evaluate this program to know it was successful?) will help drive the overall plan. The recommended strategy for [...] "direction leadership and organization" [...] by the CDC includes: leadership support dedicated to championing wellness and modeling behaviors; workplace Wellness <b>Committee,</b> <b>Coordinator</b> or Council; development of a resource list of available assets; defined mission, vision, goals, objectives and strategies; comprehensive communication plan; evidence-based practices; and data collection and analysis.

40|$|The book {{collects}} contributions {{presented and}} discussed during International Conferences and Consultations {{organized by the}} “Centesimus Annus – Pro Pontifice” Foundation (CAPPF) in the two-year period 2015 – 2016. In particular, articles here reported derive from two International Conferences held in the Vatican (“Rethinking Key Features of Economic and Social Life”, 25 - 27 May 2015, and “Business initiative {{in the fight against}} poverty. The Refugee Emergency, our Challenge”, 12 - 14 May 2016) and an International Consultation held in Malta (“A Dialogue on Finance and the Common Good”, 29 - 30 January 2016). Summary reports and fi nal proposals of the meetings are also included in the volume. Specifically, three dramatic issues, here envisaged as true global threats, are considered. First the refugee emergency, currently one of the most compelling humanitarian challenges confronting governments around the world. Then the challenges of non-inclusive growth and, more generally, the difficulties faced to achieve true human development and, finally, the ethical issues involved in designing and implementing effective financial reforms. The common thread running through all the contributions is that the future of human beings is today in jeopardy {{as a result of a}} number of interlinked and highly dependent phenomena such as excessive consumption in rich countries, inequality between and within countries, extreme poverty, migration, violence, environmental degradation. What we need today is a resolute determination to change behavior at all levels. Politicians, leaders and single citizens in their daily action have all to be far more sensitive than they are today to the common well-being. They should seriously start taking care of both the others and the environment. This requires a difficult and challenging cultural change, but it is necessary if we are willing to effectively face the present global emergencies. The book includes an Introduction by Giovanni Marseguerra (CAPPF Scientifi c <b>Committee</b> <b>Coordinator)</b> and Anna Maria Tarantola (CAPPF Board member and Delegate for the Scientific Committee) ...|$|E

40|$|DNA barcoding {{facilitates}} {{the identification of}} species and the estimation of biodiversity by using nucleotide sequences, usually from the mitochondrial genome. Most studies accomplish this task by using the gene encoding cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI; Entrez COX 1). Within this barcoding framework, many taxonomic initiatives exist, such as those specializing in fishes, birds, mammals, and fungi. Other efforts center on regions, such as the Arctic, or on other topics, such as health. DNA barcoding initiatives exist for all groups of vertebrates except for amphibians and nonavian reptiles. We announce the formation of Cold Code, the international initiative to DNA barcode all species of these ‘cold-blooded’ vertebrates. The project has a Steering <b>Committee,</b> <b>Coordinators,</b> and a home page.
