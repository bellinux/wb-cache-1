The cotton roller ginning process is the mechanical separation of cotton fibres from their seeds by means of one or more rollers to which fibres adhere while the seeds are impeded and struck off or pulled loose. When the seed-cotton is ginned, due to persistent rubbing of CCLC rollers over the fixed knives, the ginned lint cotton adsorbs about 143 to 1990 mg/kg (ppm) as total chromium of trivalent and hexavalent forms and the cotton products carry with it of about 17 to 250 mg/kg (ppm) of chromium which according to Indian Standards (MOEF- 157, 1996) for yarn and fabrics, should not be more than 0. 1 mg/kg (ppm). Toxic effects are produced by prolonged contact with airborne or solid or liquid chromium compounds even in small quantities because of their properties viz. carcinogenecity, mutagenecity and corrosiveness.

The available evidence suggests the possibility of elevation of the issue to the agenda for agency rule-making, and subsequent implementation can occur {{even in the absence}} of focusing events. Based on historical evidence, this article illustrates that gradual accumulation of knowledge of harmful effects of chromium over the period of decades has been instrumental in the formulation and implementation of standards and guidelines to regulate chromium in the environment under major statutes such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and so on. The implementation of command and control regulations has resulted in appreciable reduction of chromium released into the environment, thereby minimizing the impact on human health and the environment. However, achieving full compliance from metal finishing industries is still an illusion. There are examples of violations committed by industries. In response to this realization, policy evolution in the <b>chromium</b> <b>pollution</b> control domain has occurred in two directions: (1) gradual replacement of existing standards with more stringent standards and guidelines and (2) emphasis on multimedia, voluntary, and participatory approaches to improve compliance.

Software in usage was SPSS version 17. There was a significant correlation between the reduction of chromium and cadmium metals in the soils and the accumulation of chromium and cadmium metals in the worm’s body.

Comparison of mortality in two different time periods showed that by passing the time and by increase in soil chromium and cadmium concentrations the death toll of worms rises. The increased mortality of worms in the soil at a concentration of 0. 08 mg/g of chromium, say that using the worms for bioremediation is not recommended at such concentration of chromium but using the worms for the removal of cadmium at concentrations of 0. 04 mg/g and 0. 08 mg/g in the soil is recommended...|$|R

To front the problem precipitation processes, based on lime addition, are frequently adopted, because of their low cost. Nonetheless, due to the colloidal form of precipitates, these processes have {{to be carried out}} with great attention to reach required performances. An interesting alternative to precipitation processes is represented by adsorption of chromium on low cost-materials, especially if chromium can be recovered from produced sludges, regenerating the adsorbent, and reducing sludge toxicity. Among others, chitosan, a carbohydrate obtained from deacetilation of chitin, the second polysaccharide for diffusion in the environment, seems to be very attractive. Previous studies, in fact, have shown that it has a good sequestrating ability towards many heavy metals, including chromium, and can be added during treatment as component of seafood shells, instead of being dosed as pure chemical product. Starting from these considerations it is presented an experimental study, whose aim is to better understand the advantages of chitosan use for tannery wastewater treatment. The study includes a preliminary investigation on the main mechanisms responsible for chromium removal in presence of chitosan, discerning between adsorption on polymeric groups of this polysaccharide, and formation of insoluble chromium hydroxide, caused by pH increase induced by chitosan addition. Process efficiency is also quantified, and treatment optimisation is proposed. This part of the study, carried out with synthetic wastewater to exclude any effects related to compounds other than chromium, allows to recognize adsorption as the main process causing chromium removal, and to assess the good performances related to chitosan as sequestrating agent. Successive investigations, carried out using real wastewater, concern, instead, the possibility of chromium recovery from produced sludge, and the possibility of process development using seafood shells instead of commercial chitosan.

In the present paper, NZVI was supported on MgO grains to facilitate the treatments for remediation of chromium-contaminated waters. The performances and mechanisms of the developed composite, in the removal of hexavalent chromium, were investigated by means of batch and continuous tests. Kinetic studies, under different operating conditions, showed that reduction of Cr(VI) could be expressed by a pseudo second-order reaction kinetic. The reaction rate increased with the square of Fe(0) amount, while it was inversely proportional to the initial chromium concentration. The process performance was satisfactory also under uncontrolled pH, and a limited influence of temperature was observed. The reactive material was efficiently reusable for many cycles without any regeneration treatment. The performances in continuous tests were close to 97 % for about 80 pore volume of reactive material...|$|E
40|$|<b>Chromium</b> <b>pollution</b> due to {{leaching}} and weathering of chromite mine overburden in mine {{seepage water}} is a serious environmental problem. In an attempt to explore the indigenous chromate resistant and reducing bacteria from chromite mine quarry seepage, 145 aerobic, heterotrophic bacteria were isolated from 14 mine seepage samples derived from chromite mines of Sukinda valley and Baula-Nuasahi belt in Orissa, India. A total of 109 isolates which were tolerant to 2 mM Cr(VI) showed different degrees of Cr(VI) reducing activ-ity in complex KSC medium and synthetic Vogel Bonner (VB) broth. Ten isolates belonging to genera like Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Cupriavidus and Corynebacterium were {{selected on the basis}} of their chromate reducing efficiency and it was found that they could reduce more than 50 and 75 % of Cr(VI) in VB broth and KSC medium respectively. The sole Gram-positive isolate, Corynebacterium paurometabo-lum SKPD 1204 (MTCC 8730) showed maximum chromate reducing capacity in both VB broth (63. 7 %) and KSC medium (92 %) and was capable of reducing nearly 95 % of the total Cr(VI) in the mine seepage when it was grown in the mine seepage supplemented with 2 % VB concentrate...|$|E
40|$|As a tanning {{material}} alum salt has similar {{properties of the}} basic chromium sulphate. It is, therefore, {{the purpose of this}} research is to exchange chromium tannage with alum tannage in pretanning for the vegetable tanned lining leather. In doing such a way the <b>chromium</b> <b>pollution</b> may be eliminated, whereas the alum pretanned lining leather output must be fulfill the physical and chemical requirements as that one of the chrome pretanned. In pretanning the use of alum tannage varied from 2, 5 %, 3, 0 %, 3, 5 % and 4, 0 %. Afterwards the subsequent process was vegetable tanning using 30 % of mimosa powder. The lining leather output from the research was physical and chemical tested. The practical meaning of this research is that for pretanning the vegetable tanned lining leather it is possible to use 2, 5 % alum salt. The values of the physical and chemical test obtained are that the degree of tannage is 94, 54, tensile strength is 174, 24 kg/cm 2, and strength is 22 %. Water absorption for 2 hours is 133, 01 % and for 24 hours is 134, 48 %. Whereas the flexural endurance is unbreak condition...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWastewater {{irrigation}} and the deposit of chromium residues {{during the course}} of chromate production had caused serious <b>chromium</b> <b>pollution</b> in farmland. The aim {{of this study was to}} use anaerobic fermentation residues to treat with a chromium-contaminated soil-vegetable system. Pot experiment with Chinese cabbage, indoor cultivation experiment and soil adsorption experiments were conducted in this study. The results indicated that both yields and residual chromium in Chinese cabbages with the treatment of anaerobic fermentation residues were generally better than that with the treatment of chemical fertilizer. At the second experiment, compared with raw soil, mineralized potential and mineralized rate of nitrogen increased 29. 2 % and 15. 4 % respectively after adding anaerobic fermentation residues. Experimental results were fitted to Langmuir equation, Freundlich equation and Temkin equation, Langmuir equation was found to be the best to describe the adsorption of phosphor, and Temkin equation was the fittest for describing the adsorption of potassium. The supply of nitrogen, phosphor and potassium from soil were enhanced in varying degree (nitrogen > phosphor >potassium). Thus anaerobic fermentation residues may be considered as a widespread, effective and safe strategy for deal with chromium-contaminated soil-vegetable system in future...|$|E
40|$|National audienceA hydrogeochemical {{study of}} an {{industrial}} site where sulfuric acid and copper sulfate ("bouillie bordelaise") are manufactured {{showed that the}} phreatic aquifer is contaminated by copper, sulfate, chromium, arsenic and has an acid pH Field observations and laboratory experiments, both necessary {{if we are to}} understand the processes controlling tranfers at the solid-liquid interface, were used to investigate the behaviour of chromium. In the field, monitoring the mixing of polluted and unpolluted water with a conservative tracer, we shows that chromium disappears from solution. In the laboratory, the potential for retention of dissolved chromium by an unpolluted aquifer solid was studied as a function of pH, with and without a complexing agent. Adding high concentrations of a complexing agent, EDTA, mobilizes the previously fixed chromium at basic pH (90 %). Addition of Cr(III) with EDTA gathered, sorption is greatest (50 %) for neutral and basic pH values. Unpolluted aquifer solids have a high sorption capacity for Cr(III). However, adding a complexing agent significantly mobilizes the chromium. Sorption of the complexed chromium is also considerably decreased. There should, therefore, be little risk of immediate <b>chromium</b> <b>pollution</b> in the absence of dissolved complexing agents, as long as the pH of the system is neutral...|$|E
40|$|<b>Chromium</b> <b>pollution</b> is {{produced}} in connection with industrial processes like in tanneries. It {{has been suggested that}} bioremediation could be a good option for clean up. The stress effect of variable chromate levels, pHs and growth temperatures on biochemical parameters of two Cr(VI) reducing bacterial strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa Rb- 1 and Ochrobactrum intermedium Rb- 2 was investigated. Transmission electrone microscopy (TEM) was performed to study the intracellular distribution of Cr(VI). It was observed that initial stress of 1000 µgmL- 1 caused significant enhancement of all studied biochemical parameters at pH 7. 0 and growth temperature of 37 °C showing great bioremediation potential of the strains. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the distribution of chromium precipitates was not uniform as they were distributed in the cytoplasm as well as found associated with the periplasm and outer membrane. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed the possible involvement of carboxyl, amino, sulpohonate and hydroxyl groups present on the bacterial cell surface for the binding of Cr(VI) ions. Cr(VI) stress brought about changes in the distridution of these functional groups. It can be concluded that the investigated bacterial strains adjust well to Cr(VI) stress in terms of biochemical parameters and along that exhibited alteration in morphology...|$|E
