However, {{due to the}} increase in the agency's output, the weight of the propeller, propulsion shaft, vane pitch and the number is increased. Simultaneously, various. vibrations occur in the shaft. Thus, the design of shaft, and vibration analysis has become a challenging matter.

A detailed high frequency model of the proposed system has been developed based on capacitive couplings between different objects of the machine.
