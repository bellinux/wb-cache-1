50|$|Button {{cells are}} highly effective, {{but it is}} {{difficult}} to extend the same construction to larger sizes due to air diffusion performance, heat dissipation, and leakage problems. Prismatic and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cell</b> designs address these problems. Stacking prismatic cells requires air channels in the battery and may require a fan to force air through the stack.|$|E
50|$|Trisilane is a trace {{product of}} the {{reaction}} between SiH2 and HCl. This reaction is done using infrared lasers.

This process reacts lithium aluminium hydride with octachlorotrisilane in 1-butoxybutane. Trisilane is also yielded by thermal decomposition of monosilane and disilane at higher temperatures as demonstrated by Bowrey, Purnell and Walsh in the sixties.|$|E

The slight separation of the cells provides maximum absorption of carbon dioxide.

50|$|The {{process is}} {{controlled}} by a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cell</b> rotor driven by the engine crankshaft via a belt or chain. Individual cells alternately open and close the exhaust gas and fresh air apertures. When the aperture on the exhaust gas side is reached, pressurized exhaust gas flows into the cell and compresses the fresh air there. As the cell rotor continues to rotate and reaches the aperture on the inlet side, the compressed air flows to the engine. Before the exhaust gas can flow, the aperture is closed again and the exhaust gas column is reflected before entering the engine. The exhaust gas exits at high speed, sucking further intake air into the cell behind it, repeating the process.|$|E
50|$|Cytoplasmic {{streaming}} occurs due to {{the motion}} of organelles attached to actin filaments via myosin motor proteins. However, in Chara corallina, the organization of actin filaments is highly ordered. Actin is a polar molecule, which means that myosin only moves in one direction along the actin filament. Thus, in Chara corallina, where motion of the chloroplasts and the mysoin molecule follow a barber pole pattern, the actin filaments must all be similarly oriented within each section. In other words, the section where the chloroplasts move upward will {{have all of the}} actin filaments oriented in the same upward direction, and the section where the chloroplasts move downward will have all the actin filaments oriented in the downward direction. This organization emerges naturally from basic principles. With basic, realistic assumptions about the actin filament, Woodhouse demonstrated that the formation of two sets of actin filament orientations in a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cell</b> is likely. His assumptions included a force keeping the actin filament in place once set down, an attractive force between filaments leading them to be more likely align as a filament already in place, and a repulsive force preventing alignment perpendicular to the length of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cell.</b> The first two assumptions derive from the molecular forces within the actin filament, while the last assumption was made {{due to the}} actin molecule’s dislike of curvature. Computer simulations run with these assumptions with varying parameters for the assumptive forces almost always leads to highly ordered actin organizations. However, no order was as organized and consistent as the barber pole pattern found in nature, which suggests this mechanism plays role, but is not wholly responsible for the organization of actin filaments in Chara corallina.|$|E

40|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} are increasingly used in mobile applications where mechanical vibrations and shocks are a constant companion. This work shows how these mechanical loads affect lithium-ion cells. Therefore pouch and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cells</b> are stressed with vibrational and shock profiles {{according to the}} UN 38. 3 standard. Additionally, a vibration test is set up to reflect stress in real-world applications and is carried out for 186 days. The effects of the load profiles on the tested cells are investigated by capacity measurement, impedance spectroscopy, micro-X-ray computed tomography and post mortem analyses. The mechanical stress {{has no effect on}} the investigated pouch cells. Although all tested <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cells</b> would pass the standard tests, in certain cells stressed in a vertical position the mandrel dispatched itself and struck against internal components. This caused bruised active materials, short circuits, a damaged current collector and current interrupt device. The investigations are not directly transferrable to all pouch or <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cells</b> but show that the mechanical cell design, especially the fixation of the internal components, determines whether a cell withstands vibrations and shocks. Depending on the cell design and the loading direction, long-term vibrational loads can have additional detrimental effects on lithium-ion cells compared to standard tests...|$|R
50|$|Detection and {{measurement}} of atmospheric radioxenon {{is an important}} component of international monitoring systems for nuclear weapons testing. Monitoring stations separate xenon from air and perform isotopic analysis of the radioxenon. In one such radioxenon measurement scheme, the isotopes of interest are identified by coincident spectroscopy of electrons and photons in a β/γ coincidence spectrometer (BGCS). The β spectrometer is a plastic scintillator, manufactured as a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cell</b> containing the separated xenon sample. This cell is surrounded by the NaI(Tl) γ spectrometer. We report here the development of a calibration process for the BGCS suitable for use in remote sampling systems. This procedure is based upon γ-ray Compton scattering, resulting in a true coincident signal in both detectors, generation of electrons over a wide energy range that matches the energy distribution of electrons from radioxenon decay, and a relative insensitivity to source location. In addition to gain calibration, this procedure determines the resolution of the β detector as a function of energy.|$|E
5000|$|Polar {{organelle}} (German: Basalkörper-Membran, {{also referred}} to in some microbiological literature articles as [...] "polar membrane" [...] or [...] "polar cap") is a specialized region of the lipid cell membrane in bacterial cells, usually located {{at or near the}} so-called poles (e.g. the ends of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cell).</b> This region can easily be distinguished from the [...] "normal" [...] membrane regions in ultrathin sections of embedded bacteria by electron microscopy when the cell membrane is orientated perpendicular to the viewing direction. There, the membrane appears slightly thickened with a finely frilled layer facing the inside of the cell.It is also possible to isolate these polar organelles from the bacterial cells and study them in face view in negatively stained preparations. The polar organelle bears a fine array of attached particles in hexagonal close packing and these have been shown to possess ATPase activity. The polar organelle is invariably found in close juxtaposition to the points of insertion of the bacterial flagella into the plasma membrane, especially where multiple flagella bases are grouped in a region of the cell membrane. It may thus be inferred that the polar organelle could be of importance in the supply and transfer of energy to the bidirectional molecular rotational motor situated at the base of each individual bacterial flagellum (see also Electrochemical gradient).|$|E
40|$|The {{threshold}} of the transition to turbulence of low Prandtl number convective flows occurs {{much closer to the}} convective threshold in an extended <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cell,</b> than one could infer from a straight roll stability analysis. Convection then involves non local effects together with a closure of the spatial scales. We solve these problems by constructing an explicit analytical solution of the phase fields and of their mean flow fields, which is valid at the dominant orders of pattern distortions. We hence provide an understanding of the low value of the {{threshold of}} turbulence at low Prandtl numbers in a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>cell</b> and of the mechanisms that lead to it...|$|E
