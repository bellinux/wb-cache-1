50|$|The {{speckled}} pigeon (<b>Columba</b> <b>guinea),</b> or (African) rock pigeon, is a pigeon {{that is a}} resident breeding bird in much of Africa south of the Sahara. It is a common and widespread species in open habitats over much of its range, although there are sizable gaps in its distribution.|$|E

50|$|The Somali pigeon or Somali {{stock dove}} (Columba oliviae) is {{a species of}} bird in the family Columbidae. It is endemic to {{northern}} Somalia. Because there has hardly been any research on the species, {{the health of the}} population is uncertain. However, {{it has been suggested that}} the species is relatively rare. The IUCN Redlist identified a possible threat to the species from the speckled pigeon (<b>Columba</b> <b>guinea).</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{protozoan}} parasites of {{wild birds}} from {{the vicinity of}} Onderstepoort are recorded. New host records for the Republic of South Africa are: Haemoproteus in Threskiornis aethiopicus, Francolinus swainsonii, <b>Columba</b> <b>guinea</b> and Streptopelia senegalensis; Leucocytozoon in Anas erythrorhyncha, Netta erythrophthalma, C. guinea and Passer domesticus and Plasmodium in Numida meleagris. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi. Adobe Acroabt XI was used to OCR the text and also for the merging and conversion to the final presentation PDF-format...|$|E
30|$|Feral pigeons {{were first}} {{introduced}} by early Europeans to Southern Africa as a free-flying domesticated {{species in the}} seventeenth century (Brooke 1981). However populations both feral (Columba livia Gmelin 1789) and indigenous (speckled pigeon <b>Columba</b> <b>guinea</b> Linnaeus 1758) have since populated urban regions throughout the subcontinent. Urban resources and lifestyles associated with human activity have enabled pigeons to establish populations {{as a result of the}} available supply and distribution of food and breeding space (Haag-Wackernagel 1995) resulting in them being considered as the most successful avian coloniser of urban spaces.|$|E
40|$|Daily flight {{patterns}} of rock pigeons (<b>Columba</b> <b>guinea)</b> in the Bloemfontein area are characterised by prominent peaks in early morning and late afternoon. During {{the middle of}} the day the birds usually rest in shady places of buildings situated en route to and from field crops in the immediate vicinity of the city. Sunflower is damaged mainly by rock pigeons of which the local population was estimated to be at least 6000. Investigations of bird damage to sunflower within a radius of 20 km from the city centre amounts to between 1 and 7 % of the potential seed yield. The regular hunting of rock pigeons is recom­mended as a deterrent...|$|E
40|$|A flightless wild {{juvenile}} {{rock pigeon}} (<b>Columba</b> <b>guinea)</b> with pox-like lesions {{was picked up}} on the premises of the Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria, Onderstepoort. The pigeon was housed overnight for possible treatment the following day but died before any other intervention could be instituted. At necropsy, coalescing masses of yellowish nodular cutaneous tumour-like lesions principally on the featherless areas were noticed on the dead pigeon’s head as well as the beak. Histological examination of the sampled skin lesions revealed multifocal areas of hypertrophic and hyperplastic epidermal epithelial cells with eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Bollinger bodies). Extract from the lesion was processed and inoculated on the chorioallantoic membranes (CAM) of 11 -day-old embryonated chicken eggs and this produced pocks on one of the CAM at day 7 post-inoculation. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of poxvirus in the CAM with the pock lesions. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} a {{population}} of speckled <b>Columba</b> <b>guinea</b> and feral Columba livia pigeons on the University of South Africa’s (UNISA) Muckleneuk campus was conducted from March 2013 to February 2014. Morning and evening counts, once a week, were conducted by an observer who also noted the presence of breeding activity {{and the use of}} ledges in relation to aspect and levels of buildings. The pigeon population index fluctuated seasonally. Breeding occurred throughout the year, with notable peaks and declines relating to physiological and population dynamics. Opportunistic use of the crop availability was made during optimal production periods, while conserving energy when not favourable. Site selection in relation to building aspect indicated significant differences in all the seasons except for winter, while a positive significant relationship between level height and pigeon numbers was recorded. Knowledge of pigeon ecology and their use of urban landscapes contribute to further understanding wildlife management.

40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} daily visitation frequency indices by 4 large (> 150 g), 7 medium-size (50 – 150 g), 5 small (30 – 50 g) and 8 {{and tiny}} (< 30 g) frugivorous bird species on fleshy fruits of two native shrubs (Olea europaea subsp. africana and Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp. monilifera), two established alien shrubs (Solanum mauritianum and Lantana camara) and two emerging alien shrubs (Myoporum tenuifolium and Pittosporum undulatum) at nine different {{sites in the}} Cape Floristic Region. Large, medium-size and tiny birds as groups displayed significantly higher visitation frequency indices on fruits of both emerging alien shrub species than the other shrub species. Small birds as a group displayed insignificantly different visitation frequency indices on fruits of both emerging and established alien shrub species but significantly higher visitation frequency indices on fruits of both emerging and established alien shrub species than on fruits of the native shrub species. However, {{there were significant differences}} in foraging frequency indices of the bird species included within each of these body size groups on fruits of the different shrub species. Among the large birds, <b>Columba</b> <b>guinea</b> and among the medium size birds Sturnus vulgaris, Streptopelia senegalensis, Turdus olivaceus and Onychognathus morio all exhibited significantly higher visitation frequency indices on fruits of both emerging alien shrub species than on fruits of the other shrub species. These findings indicate that alien plant control measures should be focused on eradicating localised populations of emerging aliens to limit preferential consumption of their fruits by birds and consequent dispersal of their seeds that germinate readily into natural areas...|$|E
