40|$|We {{report on}} the {{photodegradation}} of diclofenac (DCF) by hydrothermal anatase nanocrystals either free or immobilized in porous silica matrix (TS) in connection to the type and amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), {{in order to have}} deeper insight into their role in the photocatalysis and to provide an effective tool to implement the DCF mineralization. TiO 2 and TS exhibit a remarkable efficiency in the DCF <b>abatement,</b> <b>supporting</b> that the utilization of anatase nanoparticles with the highly reactive { 001 }, { 010 }, and { 101 } exposed surfaces can be an effective way for enhancing the photooxidation even of the persistent pollutants. Furthermore, the hydrothermal TiO 2, when immobilized in silica matrix, preserves its functional properties, combining high photoactivity with an easy technical use and recovery of the catalyst. The catalysts performances have been related to the presence of OH•, O 21, and O 2 -• species by electron paramagnetic resonance spin-trap technique. The results demonstrated that the ROS concentration increases with the increase of photoactivity and indicated a significant involvement of O 21 in the DCF degradation. The efficacy of TiO 2 when immobilized on a silica matrix was associated with the high ROS life time and with the presence of singlet oxygen, which contributes to the complete photomineralization of DCF...|$|R

Relying on a panel dataset consisting of information from 1207 CDM wind projects in thirty provinces over the period of 2004 - 2011, this study estimates the learning rate of wind technology deployment and forecasts the learning investment corresponding to the additional costs required to reach breakeven point under the constraints of wind resources and grid capacity. Carbon revenue {{is estimated to be}} USD 18 /ton CO 2 in order to provide funding for this learning investment. The relative low CO 2 <b>abatement</b> cost <b>supports</b> the feasibility of linking carbon finance and learning investment unless the expected learning rate is sufficiently high...|$|R

40|$|Wind {{power is}} a fast growing {{alternative}} energy source. Since 2000, wind energy capacity has increased 24 percent per year with Texas leading the U. S. in installed wind turbine capacity. Most socioeconomic research in wind energy has focused on understanding local opposition, especially aesthetic impacts on the surrounding landscape. Recent studies have addressed reasons for social acceptance of wind farms, suggesting that positions both favorable and unfavorable to wind power are subtle and intricate, rather than monolithic, and rooted in place-specific issues. In the case of Texas, scholars have reported that the minimal permitting process is the dominant variable that explains the rapid rise of wind power in the state?s western region. However, scholars have yet to study the place-based local or regional factors that structure and inform acceptance of wind energy by key actors who negotiate with wind-energy firms. This thesis presents empirically determined, statistically significant social perspectives regarding socioeconomic wind energy impacts. I determined social perspectives by using Q-Method in Nolan County, Texas, a major site of wind-power development. Q-Method allows researchers to generalize about social perspectives, but not about how widely or deeply populations ascribe to social perspectives. Q-Method combines qualitative and quantitative techniques beginning with semi-structured interviews to collect statements on wind power, followed by participant ranking of statements on a ?most disagree? to ?most agree? scale. Key actors surveyed included landowners with wind turbines, elected and civilservice government officials, and prominent local business and community leaders. My findings identified five significant clusters of opinion, two of which shared strong support for wind energy {{on the basis of}} perceived positive economic impacts. Three clusters of opinion were less favorable to wind energy; these arguments were based upon opposition to tax <b>abatements,</b> <b>support</b> of tax <b>abatements,</b> and concerns over negative impacts to the community. Consensus emerged over the idea that positive views toward wind-energy development were unrelated to broader commitments to renewable energy. The support of key actors in favor of wind energy is contingent upon direct financial benefits from wind-energy royalties, political views on taxes, notions of landscape aesthetics, and sense of community...|$|R

The focus of this measurement program describe in this report is on size segregated particulate air pollution. Such airborne particulate matter can have a significant impact on human health and urban visibility. These data provide the input to receptor models that may permit the mitigation of these impacts by identification and quantitative apportionment of the particle sources. The aim of this report is to provide an overview of the measurements of concentrations and composition of particulate air pollution in two size fractions across the participating countries. For many of the large cities in this region, the measured particulate matter concentrations are greater than air quality standards or guidelines that have been adopted in developed countries. © 2008, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple {{model of a}} polluting industry and an innovating firm. The polluting industry is faced with regulation and costly abatement. Regulation may be taxes or marketable permits. The innovating firm invests in R&D and develops technologies which {{reduce the cost of}} pollution abatement. The innovating firm can patent this innovation and use a licensing fee to generate revenue. In a world of certainty, the first best level of innovation and <b>abatement</b> can be <b>supported</b> by either a pollution tax or a marketable permit. However, the returns to the innovator from innovation are not the same under the two regimes. A marketable permit system allows the innovator to capture all of the gains to innovation; a tax system involves sharing the gains of innovation between the innovator and the polluting industry. ...|$|R

Reinforcing the chemical status as an indicator for hazardous contamination and as a basis for prioritization and management requires complementation of PS-based status assessment with solution-oriented tools (1) covering chemical contamination and toxic risk in a more integrative and differentiating manner, (2) indicating and diagnosing toxic stress on the ecological status and (3) <b>supporting</b> <b>abatement</b> options to improve the quality status of a water body [11, 12]. These tools should address a much broader range of substances and consider mixture effects and risks rather than concentrations of individual compounds only [4].

40|$|The {{implementation}} of emissions reduction policies in Australia has experienced significant volatility {{over the last}} decade and remains in doubt due to different attitudes towards such policies by policy makers. One of the critical concerns of policy makers is that the costs of these policies would adversely affect economic activity and result in larger economic volatility. This paper investigates how business cycle fluctuations of the Australian economy, arising from productivity shocks, would be affected under an abatement reduction subsidy policy in which the regulator <b>supports</b> <b>abatement</b> efforts in each period. To answer this question, a real business cycle (RBC) model is applied. The responses of economic and environmental variables to unexpected productivity shocks are presented and compared. The results indicate that the regulator should adjust the abatement subsidy to be pro-cycle, i. e. increase during expansion and decrease during recessions...|$|R

Implementing an effective CDM system (whether under the Kyoto Protocol or any agreement that replaces it) will require recognizing that pro-jects may fail because of intentional nonperformance by participants, the with-holding of necessary cooperation by nonparticipants, adverse external events, or any combination of these. Maximizing the benefits to the climate change regime will require establishing project criteria and monitoring procedures that distinguish project-related from participant-related risk. Rather than adopting an exclusively adversarial approach focused on identifying and pun-ishing those causing project failure, effective implementation will benefit from facilitative measures to avert failures before they occur and will reward pro-jects that succeed under adversity. The CDM system’s ultimate success also will require progressively evaluating and refining {{the system as a}} whole, as well as individual projects...|$|R

40|$|Is drastic {{action against}} global warming {{essential}} to avoid impoverishing our descendants? Or {{does it mean}} robbing the poor {{to give to the}} rich? Alas, we don’t yet know. Yet most of us can agree on the importance of minimizing expected deprivation. Because of the vast number of future generations, if there is any significant risk of catastrophe, this implies drastic and expensive carbon abatement unless we discount the future. I argue that we should not discount. Instead, the rich countries should stump up the funds to <b>support</b> <b>abatement</b> both for themselves and the poor states of the world. Yet to ask the present generation to assume all the costs of drastic mitigation. is unfair. Worse still, it is politically unrealistic. We can square the circle by shifting part of the burden to our descendants. Even if we divert investment {{from other parts of the}} economy or increase public debt, future people should be richer, so long as we avert catastrophe. If so, it is fair for them to assume much of the cost of abatement. What we must not do is to expose them to the threat of disaster by not doing enough...|$|R
40|$|A modAl is {{developed}} {{to describe the}} sulfur dioxide and particulate air pollution characteristics of a fossil fueled steam electric power plant. The model contains three stages. The first considers boiler emissions {{and the application of}} one of four parameterized abatement methods: wet limestone scrubbing, catalytic oxidation, magnesium oxide scrubbing, and the use of tall stacks. The second stage tests stack emissions and uses meteorological dispersion models, particularly the double gaussian model, to determine and test three hour, twenty-four hour and annual worst case ground level concentrations. The third stage calculates the performance of the abatement method used in terms of economics and resource costs. The model can be used to determine feasible combinations of plant types, site types and <b>abatement</b> methods as <b>support</b> for a separate generation expansion model. It can also be used independently to study environmental and economic sensitivities to changes in air pollution standards. General descriptions of the operation of the abatement methods and explanations of meteorological modeling are included. Examples of the use of the model as an evaluative planning tool and as a sensitivity analysis tool, examining sulfur dioxide standards, are given. A computer listing of the model is included.

40|$|Carbon pricing is an {{important}} mechanism for providing companies with incentives to invest in carbon abatement. Price formation in carbon markets involves a complex interplay between policy targets, dynamic technology costs, and market rules. Carbon pricing may under-deliver investment due to R&D externalities, requiring additional policies which themselves affect market prices. Also, abatement costs depend {{on the extent of}} technology deployment due to learning-by-doing. This paper introduces an analytical framework based on marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves with the aim of providing an intuitive understanding of the key dynamics and risk factors in carbon markets. The framework extends the usual static MAC representation of the market to incorporate policy interactions and some technology cost dynamics. The analysis indicates that supporting large-scale deployment of mature abatement technologies suppresses the marginal cost of abatement, sometimes to zero, whilst increasing total <b>abatement</b> costs. However, <b>support</b> for early stage R&D may reduce both total abatement cost and carbon price risk. An important aspect of the analysis is in elevating risk management considerations into energy policy formation, as the results of the stochastic modelling indicate wide distributions for the emergence of carbon prices and public costs around the policy expectations.

40|$|The 'flight from blight' {{and related}} literatures on urban {{population}} changes and crime have primarily considered times of high or increasing crime rates. Perhaps the most cited recent {{work in this}} area, Cullen and Levitt (1999), does not extend through 1990 s, a decade during which crime rates declined almost continuously, to levels that were lower than experienced in decades. This paper examines whether such declines contributed to city population growth and retention (abated flight). Through a series of population growth models that attempt to identify causality through several strategies (including instrumental variables) we find at best weak evidence that overall city growth is affected by changes in crime. We find no evidence that growth is differentially sensitive to reductions in crime, as compared to increases. Focusing more narrowly on within MSA migration, residential decisions that {{are more likely to}} be sensitive to local conditions, we do find evidence <b>supporting</b> <b>abatement</b> of 'flight' - that is, lower levels of crime in central cities in the 1990 s are associated with lower levels of migration to the suburbs. This greater ability to retain residents already in the city does not appear to be accompanied by a greater ability to attract new households from the suburbs, or from outside of the metropolitan area.

40|$|Currently, {{traditional}} development {{issues such}} as economic stagnation, poverty, hunger, and illness as well as newer challenges like environmental degradation and globalisation demand attention. Sustainable development, including its economic, environmental and social elements, is a key goal of decisionmakers. Optimal economic growth {{has also been a}} crucial goal of both development theorists and practitioners. This paper examines the conditions under which optimal growth might be sustainable, by assessing {{the costs and benefits of}} growth. Key environmental and social aspects are considered. The Ecol-Opt-Growth- 1 model analyses economic–ecological interactions, including resource depletion, pollution, irreversibility, other environmental effects, and uncertainty. It addresses some important issues, including savings, investment, technical progress, substitutability of productive factors, intergenerational efficiency, equity, and policies to make economic growth more sustainable—a basic element of the sustainomics framework. The empirical results support growing concerns that costs of growth may outweigh its benefits, resulting in unsustainability. Basically, in a wide range of circumstances, long term economic growth is unsustainable due to increasing environmental damage. Nevertheless, the model has many options that can be explored by policy makers, to make the development path more sustainable, as advocated by sustainomics. One example suggests that government <b>supported</b> <b>abatement</b> programs are needed to move towards sustainable development, since the model runs without abatement were infeasible. The optimal rate of abatement increases over time. Abatement of pollution is necessary to improve ecosystem viability and increase sustainability. Further research is necessary to seek conditions under which alternative economic growth paths are likely to become sustainable. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Wetlands are {{productive}} transitional lands between terrestrial {{and aquatic}} systems. They provide social, {{economic and cultural}} values, while providing valuable services such as carbon storage, water purification, flood <b>abatement</b> and biodiversity <b>support.</b> While wetlands only cover ~ 3 % of the globe, they contribute up to 40 % of these global renewable ecosystem services. Worldwide degradation of wetlands through urbanisation, conversion to agriculture and flood management schemes {{has resulted in a}} 50 % loss of the worlds original wetlands, with New Zealand being one of the most extreme examples of this with > 90 % of the original extent of wetlands being lost. Wetlands unique hydrology results in distinct plant zonation and community composition and seedling survival is the primary factor that influences stand structure and community composition. However, restoring degraded wetlands is challenging because the alterations to the hydrology through filling or diverting water will impact the effect of physical, chemical and biotic environmental variables on native plant establishment. The use of facilitation in restoration through successional planting using nurse trees, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is common in restoration, however research into the effectiveness of these techniques in wetland systems is lacking. This thesis is comprised of two studies with aims to determine the factors that had the biggest impact on the survival and growth of kahikatea and totara in Wairio wetland and inform future restoration. Wairio wetland has large isolated remnant kahikatea trees, so my first study focused on how these established trees and a connection to fungal hyphae networks influenced the survival and growth of newly planted saplings. One sapling of each species was planted at the dripline of the remnant tree, and another sapling of each species was planted 2 metres from that point. Out of the 16 remnant kahikatea trees used, 8 were ‘disturbance’ plots where saplings were planted in 35 μm mesh bags that excluded roots but fungal hyphae could penetrate, in slotted pots which were turned every 3 months. In the 8 remaining ‘undisturbed’ plots, saplings were planted into the ground. I assessed the influence of distance and disturbance on sapling survival and growth using a chi-square test of independence and general linear models. Results showed that kahikatea trees survived better than totara overall. The survival of totara was significantly reliant on a close proximity to the remnant kahikatea, and a connection with mycorrhizal networks. Kahikatea had greater biomass than totara, however they suffered strong conspecific competition with the remnant trees, with kahikatea saplings planted at the dripline having 51. 28 g greater biomass with regular disturbance of AMF mycelium. Kahikatea trees are light demanding species, and therefore growing under the canopy of a parent tree has a negative impact on kahikatea saplings growth. Knowing that kahikatea and totara trees respond differently to nurse trees and AMF, my second study focused on how nurse effects and AMF association changes with chemical, physical and environmental stressors. The survival and growth of 5 -year-old kahikatea and totara trees, with or without a nurse across 10 blocks in Wairio wetland were analysed. At each tree, soil moisture and root available nutrients were measured and soil cores were taken to determine gravimetric soil moisture, reduction-oxidation reaction (redox), pH, soil carbon content and I counted the presence of AMF spores in two size classes. I assessed tree survival and growth against these variables using a chi-squared test of independence and general linear models. The results of this study showed that kahikatea survived better than totara trees in the very wet blocks, where no other species survived. Totara trees survived in the upland sites of the wetland and had better growth than kahikatea trees. Moreover, totara trees grew 24 cm taller {{in the presence of a}} nurse tree, and were strongly positively associated with spore number. Nurse trees further benefitted totara trees by increasing plant available soil nitrate and potassium by almost double...|$|R
