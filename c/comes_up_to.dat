At this point, he tells Kurt that he has {{prostate}} cancer. He also has brought Blaine with him, who tries to win back Kurt's trust, but the trip is uneasy. When Kurt begins at NYADA, he struggles initially to find his place, and meets a student named Adam Crawford, a senior who wants to recruit him for his own show choir, Adam's Apples, and also seems interested in Kurt himself; Kurt eventually asks him out for coffee. While at Will and Emma's wedding, Kurt and Blaine hook up, leaving their relationship in a question, since Kurt is dating Adam, but not exclusive. When Kurt returns to New York, there is a snowstorm, leaving Kurt, Rachel, Santana, and Adam stuck together in the loft watching movies together.

The engine-critical systems, including the starter drive, are arranged on the high-pressure shaft, with aircraft systems on the low-pressure shaft. The high-pressure shaft also rotates faster than the low-pressure shaft, which may influence the distribution of accessories.|$|E

25|$|In early October 1483 Sultan Bayezid II sent a large Ottoman {{force of}} around 7000 Akıncı, led by Harsi Pasha and Serli Hasan, that crossed the Una and Sava rivers and broke into Croatia. The most {{affected}} areas were the countrysides of Jastrebarsko and Petrovina. Their army was split into 3 parts, each going its own course, with one continuing towards Carniola and Carinthia on 16 October. Matthias Gereb, {{who became the}} Ban of Croatia that year, was informed about the raid, but he was lacking the forces to confront the Ottomans. Therefore, he started assembling an army with the Croatian nobles; Count Bernardin Frankopan, Ivan Frankopan Cetinski, Mihovil Frankopan Slunjski, Petar Zrinski and ban deputy Gašpar Perušić, who were later joined by Despot of Serbia Vuk Grgurević and Blaise Magyar. A part of the Croatian cavalry was sent to track the Ottomans on distance and if an opportunity <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> intercept them.|$|E

We therefore shake our heads and say 'Ah! You should have seen Grimaldi!'" [...] Another writer commented that his performances elevated his role by [...] "acute observation upon the foibles and absurdities of society. ... He is the finest practical satyrist that ever existed. ... He was so extravagantly natural, that [...] ashamed to laugh till tears coursed down their cheeks at Joe and his comicalities." [...] The British dramatist James Planché worried, in a rhymed couplet, that Grimaldi's death meant {{the end of a}} genre: [...] "Pantomime's best days are fled; Grimaldi, Barnes, Bologna dead!" ...|$|E

They present the award for the oldest man in Springfield to Cornelius Chapman, who is 108 years old. Chapman <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> accept his award, but when Spears gives him a congratulatory kiss on the cheek, he dies of a heart attack. The award is therefore given to the now oldest Springfieldian in the crowd, Mr. Burns. After Burns wins, he realizes {{he is not a}} young man anymore, so he and his assistant Smithers go to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota for a check-up. Burns decides to give the Simpson family an opportunity to house sit his private mansion while he is being tested for various diseases.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Over" [...] {{was directed by}} Jake Nava in Los Angeles, California, who also directed the video for her previous single [...] "Rumors" [...] (2004). It {{was inspired by the}} 1999 film American Beauty. In the video, Lohan is walking home, when she sees her love interest (played by Drew Fuller) looking out of a window in his house as his mother sets the table behind him. Then his father <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> him, and they begin to argue. The curtains close and Lohan continues on to her house, next door to her boyfriend’s, and runs up to her bedroom. Looking out her window, she sees that he is looking back at her. As noted inside Lohan’s bedroom, she is starting to experiment with rebellious adolescence. There are Teletubbies and stuffed pandas, but also posters of bands such as L7, the Dead Kennedys and CBGB. These imagery are intercut with shots of Lohan and her band playing in a garage, a pool party, and also her love interest destroying his father’s car in the family garage.|$|E

500|$|As the British {{military}} and loyal militia mopped up {{the remnants of}} the rebellion in Wexford and other counties, the atrocities and sectarian violence left a mark on Cornwallis. He wrote that [...] "the life of a Lord Lieutenant of Ireland <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> my idea of a perfect misery; but if I can achieve the great object of consolidating the British Empire, I shall be sufficiently repaid." [...] In early July he issued a proclamation offering amnesty to rebels who laid down their arms and took an oath to the crown, and he cracked down on the sometimes arbitrary courts martial held in the field by requiring the review of all sentences in Dublin. [...] However, not all of Ireland received this treatment: areas that were still [...] "disturbed" [...] were exempted from the requirement, Lord Castlereagh, Cornwallis' Chief Secretary, reported that [...] "numbers were tried and executed" [...] without the lord lieutenant's review. One principal stronghold of the rebels was the Wicklow Mountains, through which the army began construction of a road facilitate its operations. [...] The Wicklow Military Road survives today as the R115 road in Wexford and Dublin.|$|E
500|$|For {{most of the}} film, Berry's character, Turner, the 9-1-1 operator, does {{stay inside}} [...] "the hive" [...] before {{becoming}} {{actively involved in the}} search for Breslin's character, Welson, the kidnapped caller. D'Ovidio chose two female leads, explaining, [...] "I wanted strong women... I think it was appropriate here, since most 911 call operators are women." [...] Berry remarked, [...] "I love the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women. We don't often get to play roles like this, where ordinary people become heroic and do something extraordinary." [...] D'Ovidio chose to tell the story from the perspective of two characters—the operator and the caller—believing that it would become repetitive if it focused on only one. As a result, he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay. As well as collaborating on the story with his wife, Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp, he accepted suggestions from Berry, Breslin and Eklund: [...] "Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out. I'm not one to say 'no' to a great suggested line of dialogue. It just makes me look better as a writer! I feel it's a very collaborative process, and some of the happiest accidents happen when you just listen to people. When someone <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> you and says, 'Why don't we do it this way?' I think that it's important to listen." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from December 31, 1910. It states, [...] "May Smalley is a simple little country girl with whom Jack, a youth whom she has known since childhood, {{is very much in}} love. When a traveling show, consisting of a hypnotist and a Hindu magician comes to the opera house in her little town, the two young people are among the other interested spectators who flock to see the performance. May's youth and beauty attract the hypnotist, who plans to lure her away from her home. He sends May a message that he has a communication for her from the spirit world. Against the protest of Jack, her escort, May goes behind the scenes after the performance to meet with the great hypnotist, who fascinates her with his wiles. The hypnotist is an unscrupulous villain, and seeing that May is thoroughly impressed with his few tricks and considers him quite superhuman, he induces her to follow him when he leaves the town. How Jack proves himself to be a youth of resource as well as courage, the important part he played in May's deliverance by the Hindu fakir, is well told by the picture. Finally the hypnotist is shown in his true light. May is disillusioned, and comes to decide that Jack is just about the kind of protection she needs in a world of uncertainty." [...] According to a reviewer, Jack <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the stage where the Hindu magician is and knocks him down. Jack takes his costume and follows the hypnotist and May to the hotel where he rescues her.|$|E
