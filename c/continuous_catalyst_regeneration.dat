40|$|For several decades, the key {{challenge}} {{associated with}} thermochemical hydrogen generation {{has been the}} achievement of water splitting and <b>catalyst</b> <b>regeneration</b> at low temperatures while maintaining a reasonably high conversion efficiency over many cycles. Herein, we report low-temperature thermochemical hydrogen generation using hierarchically assembled iron oxide nanoarchitectures. Iron oxide nanoparticles conformally deposited onto a SnO 2 nanowire forest allowed the splitting of water molecules {{and the production of}} hydrogen gas at temperatures of 400 - 800 °C, with a high specific gas-forming rate as high as ∼ 25 000 μmol per g per cycle (250 min). More remarkably, deep-ultraviolet photoactivation enabled low-temperature (200 °C) <b>catalyst</b> <b>regeneration</b> and thereby multiple cycles of hydrogen production without any significant coalescence of the oxide nanoparticles nor substantial loss of the water-splitting efficiency.

[13] performed the kinetic modeling of PDH in presence of oxygenated additive over industrial Pt–Sn/γ-Al 2 O 3 in which the effect of water addition in low level on coke formation was mathematically investigated. Pt-based catalysts are poisoned by high level of oxygenate by various mechanism. Oxygenates deplete chlorine, essential for re-dispersion of sintered platinum during catalyst regeneration in <b>continuous</b> <b>catalyst</b> <b>regeneration</b> (CCR) plant, from the catalyst and increase the selectivity to carbon oxides. When used in appropriate levels, however, they could exhibit beneficial effects on catalyst performance without perceptible adverse effects [16]. Nevertheless, very few investigations have reported the effect of oxygenates and its interaction mechanism in catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes [16, 17].|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{conversion}} {{of carbon dioxide}} in the presence of TiO 2 supported NiO catalyst has been investigated in a pulsed surface-wave sustained microwave discharge. The catalyst is prepared by combination of impregnation and plasma-treatment methods. The decomposition of TiO 2 supported nickel nitrate was done by plasma, induced in three different gases (O 2, Ar, CO 2). NiO/TiO 2 catalysts were formed. The supplied gas has a prominent effect on the chemical and physical properties of the prepared catalysts. The catalyst prepared with an Ar plasma increases almost by a factor of 2 the CO 2 conversion and energy efficiencies, while the O 2 or CO 2 plasma prepared catalysts show little effect on the CO 2 conversion in comparison with catalyst-free plasma assisted dissociation. The results from the catalyst characterization by different techniques demonstrated that Ar plasma pre-treatment resulted in formation of oxygen vacancies. Dissociative electron attachment of CO 2 at the catalyst surface enhanced by oxygen vacancies and plasma electrons could explain the improved conversion and energy efficiency. A constant catalytic activity was observed indicating <b>continuous</b> <b>catalyst</b> <b>regeneration</b> under reactor conditions. A mechanism of plasma-catalysis synergy is proposed.

In 1989 BP and UOP collaborated to commission a pilot plant in Grangemouth, Scotland, for the aromatization of propane and butane. This plant, based on a technology called the Cyclar process, used <b>continuous</b> <b>catalyst</b> <b>regeneration</b> (CCR) and a gallium impregnated ZSM- 5 zeolite catalyst to achieve yields of ca. 65 % aromatics, mainly benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX) [Guisnet and Gnep, 1992].

There could be large economic incentives to convert these alkenes into more valuable products, like alcohols or aromatics. Thus the purpose of this project was to determine if gallium/H-ZSM- 5 catalysts, similar to those used in the Cyclar process, would be suitable for the aromatization of long chain alkenes. Three methods were investigated for the introduction of gallium into ZSM- 5 : (i) physical mixing with gallium oxide; (ii) impregnation by incipient wetness with gallium nitrate; (iii) ion-exchange with gallium nitrate.

Using {{selective}} {{catalytic reduction}} (SCR) that takes NH 3 as the reducing agent to remove NOx {{is one of the}} most often used coal-fired flue gas denitration technology that of the highest denitration efficiency. As the core of the SCR system, catalyst is the important factors that affect the whole SCR system denitration efficiency.

TCD usually examined over various kind of catalysts, such as monometallic, bimetallic, trimetallic, combination of metal-metal oxide, carbonaceous and/or metal doped carbon catalysts. Deactivation of catalysts is the prime drawback found in TCD process. <b>Catalyst</b> <b>regeneration</b> and co-feeding of methane with other hydrocarbon are the two solutions put forwarded in accordance to overcome deactivation hurdle. Higher amount of co-feed hydrocarbon in situ produce more amount of highly active carbonaceous deposits which assist further methane decomposition to produce additional hydrogen to a great extent.
