50|$|The diagram {{shows the}} {{essential}} {{parts of a}} typical 2-port vector network analyzer (VNA). The two ports of the device under test (DUT) are denoted port 1 (P1) and port 2 (P2). The test port connectors provided on the VNA itself are precision types which will normally have to be extended and connected to P1 and P2 using precision cables 1 and 2, PC1 and PC2 respectively and suitable <b>connector</b> <b>adaptors</b> A1 and A2 respectively.|$|R
50|$|Triaxial (also {{known as}} triax) {{connectors}} are a variant on BNC that carry a signal and guard {{as well as}} ground conductor. These are used in sensitive electronic measurement systems. Early triaxial connectors were designed with just an extra inner conductor, but later triaxial connectors also include a three-lug arrangement to rule out an accidental forced mating with a BNC <b>connector.</b> <b>Adaptors</b> exist to allow some interconnection possibilities between triaxial and BNC connectors. The triaxial may also {{be known as a}} Trompeter connection.|$|R
5000|$|The Remote Management level enables remote {{applications}} {{to access the}} MBeanServer through <b>connectors</b> and <b>adaptors.</b> A <b>connector</b> provides full remote access to the MBeanServer API using various communication (RMI, IIOP, JMS, WS-* …), while an adaptor adapts the API to another protocol (SNMP, …) or to Web-based GUI (HTML/HTTP, WML/HTTP, …).|$|R

40|$|A {{waterproof}} {{seal assembly}} for electrical connectors is disclosed having an elastomeric sleeve which encircles {{a portion of}} the cable and the plug end of the electrical <b>connector.</b> An <b>adaptor,</b> used to secure the receiving jack, extends from the securing point to meet the sleeve, thereby completely encircling the connection. A sealing bead may be provided on the inner surface of the sleeve to engage the adaptor and seal out moisture, dust, and other corrosive contaminants. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, many type N {{connectors}} are not labeled, {{and it can}} {{be difficult}} to prevent this situation in a mixed impedance environment. The situation is further complicated by some makers of 75 ohm sockets designing them with enough spring yield to accept the larger 50 ohm pin without irreversible damage, while others clearly do not, and expect users to segregate their <b>connectors</b> and <b>adaptors.</b> In general a 50 ohm socket is not damaged by a 75 ohm pin, but the loose fit means the contact quality is not guaranteed; this can cause poor or intermittent operation, with the thin 75 ohm male pin only barely mating with the larger 50 ohm socket in the female.|$|R
50|$|CFast {{cards are}} not {{physically}} or electrically compatible with CompactFlash cards. However, since SATA can emulate the PATA command protocol, existing CompactFlash software drivers can be used, although writing new drivers to use AHCI instead of PATA emulation will almost always result in significant performance gains. CFast cards use a female 7-pin SATA data connector, {{and a female}} 17-pin power <b>connector,</b> so an <b>adaptor</b> is required to connect CFast cards in place of standard SATA hard drives which use male connectors.|$|R
40|$|Service-orientation is {{not only}} a means for systems integration, but also an {{architecture}} paradigm for building systems. Flexibility, adaptability and interoperability are some of the benefits derived from the adoption of SOA. These principles are often applied to build distributed systems. But whether SOA is applied or not, building a distributed system is still complex, what increases the demand on high-quality middleware to achieve success. This paper presents a runtime service integration architecture that enables distributed service interactions regardless the capabilities of the devices involved, i. e. to deal with services distribution over a heterogeneous network. The solution presented is built upon the OSGi service platform which has been leveraged with OSS middleware components to provide remote communications (with <b>connectors</b> and <b>adaptors),</b> service discovery, service binding and service publication. The development of this architecture is carried out within the ITEA OSIRIS Consortium and is being applied to industrial case studies; including a tax administration applications, service provisioning to residential environments and a mobile CRM...|$|R
5000|$|Gyromite, {{also known}} as Robot Gyro (Jairo), is a video game {{released}} in 1985 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, designed for use with the Robotic Operating Buddy. Gyromite {{is one of two}} games in Nintendo's Robot Series, the other being Stack-Up (AKA Robot Block). The opening screen of the game shows the title Robot Gyro, the Japanese name of the game for the Family Computer. Essentially, the Gyromite game program is unchanged from the Famicom Robot Gyro cartridge, and many Gyromite cartridges contain the circuit board from a copy of [...] "Robot Gyro," [...] attached to an adaptor that allows the game to be played on NES consoles. Famicom games had 60-pin <b>connectors,</b> so the <b>adaptor</b> converted the game so it can be used with the 72-pin connector in an NES.|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The {{reliability}} of the entire communications network was dependent on the {{reliability of}} each single element. Connector was important devices that can affect {{the performance of the}} fiber communication. There were a large number of issues that affect the performance of fiber optic connectors in todays networks. These factors were increasingly as data rates, the number of wavelengths and transmission distances continue to escalate. Approach: Therefore this study was carried out to test on the influence of connectors and adapters to the performance of the optical network. Initially the actual attenuation of <b>connector</b> and <b>adaptor</b> were tested by using multifunction loss tester. The first two 1 m corning optical fibers with a connector at each end are measured. Then, both the 1 m corning optical fibers were joined together by an adaptor and connected to the Multifunction loss tester. Three types of wavelength are used as the source to test the attenuation of the fiber which is 1310, 1490 - 1550 nm. In order to measure the Bit Error Rate (BER) and the power loss in optical fiber communication, a simple simulation was carried out by using software opti sys. Results: The attenuation on the connector was caused mainly by existence of impurities in the connector, less perfect connection, scattering of beam and others. These causes the parameter such as power received, Q-factor, minimum BER and also the eye-height to change. Changes in these parameters also affect the performance at the user end. It was very critical that causes of attenuation to be eliminated. Conclusion/Recommendations: From the result it can be concluded that, the greater the attenuation, the greater the decrease in power received. It also affects the Q-factor of the system where as the attenuation increase, the maximum Q-factor decreases. As for the minimum BER, minimum BER changes as the attenuation increase initially, after a maximum value it decreases as the attenuation increases...|$|R
40|$|A wave {{interference}} filtering section {{that consists of}} three stubs of different lengths, each with an individual stopband of its own central frequency, is reported here {{for the design of}} band-stop filters (BSFs) with ultra-wide and sharp stopbands as well as large attenuation characteristics. The superposition of the individual stopbands provides the coverage over an ultra-wide frequency range. Equations and guidelines are presented for the application of a new {{wave interference}} technique to adjust the rejection level and width of its stopband. Based on that, an electrically tunable ultra-wide stopband BSF using a liquid crystal (LC) material for ultra-wideband (UWB) applications is designed. Careful treatment of the bent stubs, including impedance matching of the main microstrip line and bent stubs together with that of the SMA <b>connectors</b> and impedance <b>adaptors,</b> was carried out for the compactness and minimum insertion and reflection losses. The experimental results of the fabricated device agree very well with that of the simulation. The centre rejection frequency as measured can be tuned between 4. 434 and 4. 814 [*]GHz when a biased voltage of 0 – 20 [*]Vrms is used. The 3 [*]dB and 25 [*]dB stopband bandwidths were 4. 86 [*]GHz and 2. 51 [*]GHz, respectively, which are larger than that of other recently reported LC based tunable BSFs. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
