DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for isolation of particles (110) suspended in a first suspension from the suspension, where the first suspension comprises further suspended components, comprises separating the particles from the first suspension through filtration in two filters (420, 430), where the first filter is suited for the retention of the further component and for the filtration of the particles to be isolated from the first suspension and the further component is retained at the first filter, adhering the retained particles at the second filter, removing the first filter with the further component of the suspension, resuspending the particles at the second filter in a defined first volume of a second suspending fluid, where the second suspension of the particle is obtained, determining {{the total number of}} the particle to be isolated in the second suspension or number of the particles in part volume, separating the particles to be isolated from the second suspension through renewed retaining of the particle in the second filter, and resuspending the particles retained in the second filter in a second volume of a third suspending fluid, where a third suspension of the particle is obtained. The second volume of the third suspending fluid is selected in dependent upon the number of particles determined in the determination step and the pre-determined concentration of the particle is adjusted in the third suspension. The suspending fluid of the first suspension is filtered through applying the pressure drops by two filters. The particles to be isolated are held by applying a pressure drop over the second filter on the filter. The resuspending of the particle is carried out through backwashing the second filters with the second suspending fluid in a surrounded volume for the reception of the second suspension. The surrounded volume is a pipette tip. The determination {{of the total number of}} the particles is carried out by transporting a part volume of the second suspension into a <b>counter</b> <b>means</b> and counting the number of particles in the part volume of the second suspension. The second suspending fluid of the second suspension is filtered through the application of the pressure drop by the second filter.

The 'sole Hb' approach prevents a complete donor evaluation and does not allow Plt donor enrolment. To extend blood counts before donations, we evaluated the performances of a multiparametric counter using capillary blood. Materials and Methods The ABX Micros 60 (Micros 60) blood analyzer was employed on capillary blood and compared with venous counts by a reference counter (Coulter AcT 5 diff) in a first series of 416 donors and in a second series of 136, after a 3 -month period of routine use of this study counter. An average of 50 μl of capillary blood was collected whose 10 μl had been aspirated by Micros 60. Results High correlations were found between capillary counts using Micros 60 and venous counts using the reference <b>counter.</b> <b>Mean</b> Plt counts differed of 37 × 109 /l less for capillary approach in the first series of comparisons, but decreased to 10 × 109 /l less in the second series due to a greater expertise of operators in capillary sampling. All other parameters were accurate and never reached clinical relevance albeit they showed statistically significant differences.

40|$|Push-down automata with {{independent}} counters (PDACs) combine {{the power of}} PDAs and Petri Nets. They were developed in [21, 15], {{as a tool of}} recognition of languages generated by Categorial Dependency Grammars (CDGs). CDGs are classical categorial grammars extended by oriented polarized valencies. They express both projective and non-projective dependencies between the words of a sentence. PDAC is a usual PDA equipped with a finite number of counters. The independence of <b>counters</b> <b>means</b> that their state has no effect on the choice of an automaton move. In {{the first part of the}} paper we compare some variants of PDACs and prove the equivalence of two variants of PDAs {{with independent}} counters: without syntactic and without semantic ε-loops. Some connections between PDAC-languages and Petri Net languages are noticed. Then we show that PDACs are equivalent to stack+bag push-down automata (SBPA) independently introduced by Søgaard and that ε-acyclic SBPAs recognize exactly CDG-languages. Multimodal Categorial Dependency Grammars (mmCDGs) were introduced in [4] as an extension of GDGs that allows control of some intersections of dependencies. The class of mmCDG-languages is rich enough and has good closure properties, that it forms AFL. In the second part of the paper we extend PDACs and introduce push-down automata with stacks of independent counters (PDASC). PDASCs extend PDACs twofold: (i) each counter is a stack of integers and (ii) there is a restriction function which allows to diminish a head of a counter only if the heads of all dependent counters are zeros. Our main result says that these PDASCs accept exactly the class of mmCDG- languages. The article is published in the author’s wording...|$|R
40|$|The {{mouse model}} {{is widely used}} in a vast range of {{biomedical}} and preclinical studies. Thanks {{to the ability to}} detect and quantify biological processes at the molecular level in vivo, PET has become a well-established tool in these investigations. However, the need to visualize and quantify radiopharmaceuticals in anatomic structures of millimetre or less requires good spatial resolution and sensitivity from small-animal PET imaging systems. In previous work we have presented a proof-of-concept of a dedicated high- resolution small-animal PET scanner based on thin monolithic scintillator crystals and Digital Photon Counter photosensor. The combination of thin monolithic crystals and MLE positioning algorithm resulted in an excellent spatial resolution of 0. 7 mm uniform in the entire field of view (FOV). However, the limitation of the scanner was its low sensitivity due to small hickness of the LYSO crystals (2 mm). Here we present an improved detector design for a small-animal PET system that simultaneously achieves higher sensitivity and sustains a sub- millimetre spatial resolution. The proposed detector consists of a 5 mm thick monolithic LYSO crystal optically coupled to a Digital Photon <b>Counter.</b> <b>Mean</b> nearest neighbour (MNN) positioning combined with depth of interaction (DOI) decoding was employed to achieve sub-millimetre spatial resolution. To evaluate detector performance the intrinsic spatial resolution, energy resolution and coincidence resolving time (CRT) were measured.

The energy resolution was 23 % FWHM at 511 keV and CRT of 529 ps were measured. The improved detector design overcomes the sensitivity limitation of the previous design by increasing the nominal sensitivity of the detector block and retains an excellent intrinsic spatial resolution...|$|R

PURPOSE: To assess the accuracy of 6 popular activity trackers at measuring steps while walking on a treadmill. METHODS: Twenty-six college students (Mean±SD; 22. 1 ± 3. 7 yrs; 25. 1 ± 4. 0 kg/m 2; 13 male) walked 500 steps at 3 mph on a treadmill while wearing 6 different activity trackers (Pedometer, Fitbit Blaze, Charge HR, Alta, Flex, Zip, One). The Charge HR was placed two fingers above the right wrist while the Flex was next to the wrist bone. The Blaze was placed two fingers above the left wrist while the Alta was next to the wrist bone. The Fitbit Zip and the One were aligned with the hipbone on the left and right waistband respectively. Steps were counted by a trained researcher using a hand tally counter. Missing values were replaced with the mean value for that device. Step counts were correlated between Fitbit devices and the pedometer and tally counter using Pearson correlations. Significance was set at p 3 ̆c 0. 05. Mean bias scores were calculated between the step counts for each device and the tally <b>counter.</b> <b>Mean</b> Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) values were also calculated for each device relative to the tally counter.

Further stated that if the Type 055 were to mount laser weapons or electromagnetic railguns, the ship would require integrated electric propulsion to meet their power requirements. While there has been speculation that the Type 055 may have ABM capabilities like USN Baseline 9 destroyers, it likely does not because of China's lack of overseas military bases requiring a naval-based missile shield, since ballistic missile threats from regional countries would be more effectively <b>countered</b> by ground-based <b>means.</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the utopian vision of much African writing as the dynamic of hope generated in anti-colonial struggle continues to characterise contemporary poetry and novel. The premise is that Utopia is necessary, not as mere wishful thinking but as willed action, because, according to Paul Ricoeur, Utopia is the ‘No Place,’ the only place from which ideology can be <b>countered.</b> This <b>means</b> that utopia {{is the only place}} from which the discourse of catastrophe continually undermining Africa can be countermanded, the only place from which European History can be subverted. The perception of a grounded utopian future requires a vision of the past, of cultural memory freed from the confines of Western History. According to Ernst Bloch, the doyen of Marxist Utopianism, utopia cannot exist without the operation of memory. The present is the crucial site of the continual motion by which the New comes into being. In such transformative conceptions of utopian hope the “Not-Yet” is always a possibility emerging from the past. African utopianism reconsiders the possibility of an ahistorical past, rethinks the function of memory and of time itself. The momentum of hope not only imagines a hopeful future for Africa but carries forward into a perception of Africa’s impact of the world. The key to this is that the subversion of History, the affective operation of memory and a creative vision of the future is most powerfully conducted in African art and literature...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the performances of a new prototype handheld gamma probe in a series of patients with infiltrative breast cancer justifying sentinel lymph node (SLN) excision. SLN excision was performed on nine patients being treated for infiltrative breast cancer. After preoperative radio-isotope injection and lymphoscintigraphy, individual removal of all radioactive nodes was performed after their localisation using a novel new prototype handheld gamma intraoperative probe named CarolIReS. The activity of SLN following resection has been measured by a gamma ray <b>counter.</b> The <b>mean</b> geometrical detection efficiency of this gamma ray counter has been obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. With respect to the total number of SLNs identified by the CarolIReS probe, the detection probability was 80 % for the lymphoscintigraphy. A mean number of 2. 2 (1 – 5) SLNs per patient was detected after the complete SLN procedure. Among the removed SLNs, 19 were axillary SLN, 17 were located in the level I of Berg, two were located in the Rotter area and one was an intramammary SLN (ISLN) located in the lower inner area of the breast. The detection efficiency of the CarolIReS probe ranged from 2. 1 to 100. 0 cps kBq− 1 referred to the activity of the SLN at the time of the surgery. This study shows that the CarolIReS probe is well adapted to the SLN detection and allows an efficient identification of both axillary and intramammary lymph nodes...|$|R
