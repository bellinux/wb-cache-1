For example, sales returns and allowance and sales discounts are contra revenues with respect to sales, as the balance of each contra (a debit) is the opposite of sales (a credit). To understand the actual value of sales, one must net the contras against sales, which gives rise to the term net sales (meaning net of the contras).|$|E

This can also be referred to as an allowance for bad debts. Once a doubtful debt becomes uncollectable, the amount will be written off.|$|R

Competing theories abounded, with key roles being assigned to Ronald Reagan, John Paul II, Mikhail Gorbachev, Norman Podhoretz, Alexander Solzhenitzyn and Sidney Hook, as well as to freedom fighters, refuseniks and populist movements such as Solidarity. In their interpretation of various events, some scholars opted to depersonalize the process, crediting the fall of the Soviet Union to phenomena such as evolving patterns of economic development and the information revolution. Among the contributions to the postmortem literature is Richard Gid Powers' Not Without Honor (1995), which professed to be [...] "The History of American Anticommunism." [...] Powers' 554-page opus of names and organizations omits all of the American entities associated with Reverend Moon, and denies them any role in rolling back communism in the 1970s and 80s. In the 672 pages of On the Brink: The Dramatic Behind the Scenes Saga of the Reagan Era and the Men and Women who Won the Cold War (1996), Jay Winik records a brief mention of one Moon-related organization, The Washington Times, but only in noting its early reporting on the unfolding story of Iran <b>Contra.</b> <b>Accounts</b> by Brian Crozier, Adam Ulam, Bob Woodward, and Jack Matlock, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union under President Reagan, also make no mention of Moon's efforts.

Drawing {{on the case of}} the 1999 controversial Mexican election and its long term political consequences, it reveals democracy as a fantasy “gripping” subjects in support of specific regimes and exhibits its potential role for legitimizing particular hegemonies. Democracy, like all politics, appears sustained by a narrative which demands for its survival the creation of a demonized “other” containing in this way the seeds of exclusion. Importantly, this analysis gestures toward the often closed characteristic of contemporary democracy <b>contra</b> more optimistic <b>accounts</b> such as Derrida’s “democracy to come. ” Through exploring the case study of Mexico’s ongoing democratization process, this work suggests how democratic aspirations can play a role in sustaining diverse political hegemonies, even those historically characterized as authoritarian...|$|R
40|$|The sociological {{approach}} to innovation {{is discussed in}} the context of its other aspects: technical, economic, legal and psychological ones. It is assumed that social setting of contradiction or lacuna, occuring and being solved is the essence of sociological perspective. The setting consists both of relations assigned organizationally and of those more spontaneous, regulated and shaped in groups, group conformities and social conditioning of innovational activities. The basic values are defined for its analysis types shape of a course, form object and functions (kinds), intensiveness, mass scale, profit; rank, degree of complexity, prosperity, success and continuance. Three various types are characterized in detail: 1) significant innovational activity in the legal meaning, 2) innovations partially defined by law, 3) innovational activity indifferent in the light of law or even conducted <b>contra</b> legem. On <b>account</b> on the divergences of shape of innovational course, eight classes of this value are defined and characterized. On discussing a form of innovation it is pointed that its individual character is dominating upon the collective one in the industrial labor saving movement. The dominating parts are also played by technological-constructional and technological kinds of innovation. Presented values are discussed in the aspect of their substance and empirical results of a study.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the meaning of metaphors. In particular, it examines a contemporary dispute in the philosophy of language, primarily comprising critical responses to Donald Davidson’s seminal work in the area, which focuses {{on the question of whether}} metaphorical utterances, qua metaphors, ought to receive distinctive semantic evaluations. I treat this debate as an instance of a more general form of philosophical dispute, which has been explored in some detail in recent work on the nature of realism and anti-realism. The thesis has five chapters. In the first chapter, I outline, motivate and evaluate two contrasting approaches to realism, proposed by Michael Devitt and Crispin Wright. I argue that neither is wholly satisfactory, but that a modified version of Wright’s approach is likely to be most fruitful in the philosophy of metaphor. In the second chapter, I examine the character of Davidson’s anti-realism, concluding that he is best thought of as an error-theorist about metaphorical meaning. I go on to set out a unified Davidsonian argument for semantic and pragmatic anti-realism about metaphor, and offer a sustained discussion and partial defence of the six premises that such an argument proceeds from. My third chapter outlines a series of common objectives to Davidson’s views, and argues that error-theorists have the resources to address many of these criticisms in a fairly plausible manner. In the fourth chapter, I go on to investigate the realist standing of metaphorical meaning in more detail. I examine the open-endedness of metaphor in the light of Wright’s response-dependent theory of intention, and argue that this approach offers a novel response to certain anti-realist concerns. The fifth chapter concerns the relationship between metaphor and non-conceptual content. I argue that thinking of metaphorical meanings as non-conceptual entails that the non-propositional and limitless character of metaphor does not pose a fatal objection to a pragmatic realist <b>account,</b> <b>contra</b> Davidson. I apply my suggested account to two test cases: metaphors that describe one’s emotional state, and religious metaphors, and argue that in each case, thinking of the metaphors as expressing non-conceptual contents is potentially suggestive and helpful. In that chapter, I also examine the possibility of an robustly realist approach to metaphorical meanings, modelled on the epistemicist approach to vagueness set out in recent work by Timothy Williamson. I demonstrate how the dominant objection to this account can be partially defused, and go on to examine the final standing of the dispute between realist and anti-realist.
