40|$|The {{understanding}} of mechanisms leading to cellular differentiation {{is the main}} aim of numerous studies. Accessibility of DNA to transcription factors depends on local chromatin structure and chromatin compaction inhibits gene transcription. Histone acetylation correlates with an open chromatin structure and increased gene expression. Gene transcription levels are changed in early embryonic stem <b>cells</b> <b>differentiation</b> in a tissue-specific manner and epigenetic marks are modified, including increased global acetylation levels. Manipulation of histone deacetylases activity might be an interesting tool to generate populations of specific cell types for transplantation purposes.

40|$|The {{ability of}} Notch {{signaling}} to regulate T helper <b>cell</b> development and <b>differentiation</b> {{has been widely}} accepted. Fringe, O-fucose-b 1, 3 -N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases modulate Notch receptor expression and promote the Notch signaling pathway through receptor-ligand binding. In this study, we assayed the expression levels of three Fringe homologs in naive CD 4 +T cells in asthmatic rats. We found that Radical Fringe (Rfng) was highly expressed, whereas both Lunatic Fringe (Lfng) and Manic Fringe (Mfng) were expressed at low levels. Down-regulation of Rfng using siRNA, and overexpression of Lfng or Mfng enhanced Th 1 subset lineages and diminished Th 2 subset lineages. Notch signaling was more activated in asthmatic naı̈ve CD 4 +T cells than in control cells, and Lfng, but not Mfng or Rfng, partly inhibited Notch signaling in asthmatic naı̈ve CD 4 +T lymphocytes. Lfng overexpression resulted in significantly decreased Th 2 cytokine production in asthma, which was the same effect as the GSI (c-secretase inhibitor) treatment alone, but had an increased effect on Th 1 cytokines than GSI treatment. Collectively, these data identify the essential role of Fringe modulating naı̈ve CD 4 +T <b>cells</b> <b>differentiation</b> through Notch signaling. Lfng regulated Th 2 <b>cells</b> <b>differentiation</b> via a Notch-dependent manner and Th 1 <b>cells</b> <b>differentiation</b> via a Notch-independent manner. Fringe could be a therapeutic strategy for the management and prevention of allergic asthma...|$|R

25|$|MiR-1 has {{key roles}} in the {{development}} and differentiation of smooth and skeletal muscles. For example, in the lineage-specific differention of smooth muscle cells from embroyonic stem cell derived cultures, MiR-1 is required; as its loss of function resulted in a reduction in smooth muscle cell biomarkers and a reduction in the derived smooth muscle cell population. There is evidence that the control of smooth muscle <b>cell</b> <b>differentiation</b> by MiR-1 may be mediated by the down regulation of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), since a MiR-1 recognition site is predicted in the 3' UTR of KLF4 and inhibition of MiR-1 results in reversed down-regulation of KLF4 and an inhibition of smooth muscle <b>cell</b> <b>differentiation.</b> A mutation in the 3' UTR of the myostatin gene in Texel sheep creates a miR-1 and miR-206 target site. This is likely to cause the muscular phenotype of this breed of sheep.|$|E

40|$|Neural {{stem cells}} are self-renewing, {{multipotent}} and undifferentiated precursors that retain the capacity for differentiation into both glial (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) and neuronal lineages. Neural stem cells offer cell-based therapies for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and spinal cord injuries. However, their cellular behavior is poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs involved in cell development, proliferation and differentiation through regulating gene expression at post-transcriptional level. The role of miR– 381 {{in the development of}} neural stem cells remains unknown. In this study, we showed that overex-pression of miR– 381 promoted neural stem cells proliferation. It induced the neural stem <b>cells</b> <b>differentiation</b> to neurons and inhibited their differentiation to astrocytes. Furthermore, we identified HES 1 as a direct target of miR– 381 in neural stem cells. Moreover, re-expres-sion of HES 1 impaired miR- 381 -induced promotion of neural stem cells proliferation and induce neural stem <b>cells</b> <b>differentiation</b> to neurons.
