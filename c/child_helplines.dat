40|$|<b>Child</b> <b>helplines</b> {{around the}} world are an {{important}} mental health resource for many children. In this study, an international database was analysed with a total of 25 million registered calls at a total of 111 helplines affiliated with Child Helpline International. The research was aimed at discovering if there are differences between the reasons for calling of children from different parts of the world, and if shifts in the studied 10 -year period can be observed. The data show that all <b>child</b> <b>helplines</b> are contacted by young people seek support with questions concerning abuse, sexual matters and school issues. The results from a mixed model also show significant differences in the reasons for calling between Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, the Pacific region and the region Middle East and North Africa. <b>Child</b> <b>helplines</b> in Africa and other developing parts of the world received many calls related to safety and health (e. g. HIV/AIDS, commercial exploitation), whereas children and young people from Europe, North America and the Pacific more often discussed social and psychosocial issues with the helpline (e. g. mental health, peer and family relations). The reasons for calling were relatively stable for the studied period. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and National Children’s Burea...|$|E

50|$|Each {{service is}} now {{available}} in {{at least part of}} the EU. The 116117 medical assistance line is the least-widely implemented so far, having only been activated in Austria and Germany.

40|$|In a {{quantitative}} content analysis, the telephone-based and Web-based {{support of the}} Dutch child helpline were studied. Both adult judges and the children themselves indicated {{that the quality of}} chat conversations was better than that of telephone conversations. Both the chat and telephone service succeeded in improving children's well-being and decreasing the perceived burden of their problems. The findings lend support to offer a combined telephone-based and Web-based support for <b>child</b> <b>helplines...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{line with}} the wider trend of {{offering}} support via the Internet, many counseling and referral services for children have introduced online chat, often {{in addition to a}} traditional telephone service. Methods: A comparative study was conducted between the telephone service and the confidential one-on-one online chat service of the Dutch Kindertelefoon. The design included a concise pretest and a posttest (n = 902). The study also comprised a follow-up test (n = 213), which included the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results: Children experienced a higher sense of well-being and a reduced severity of their problems after consulting the Kindertelefoon. The results were slightly more favorable for the chat service than for the telephone service. The follow-up survey showed that many of the children who contact the Kindertelefoon suffer from relatively severe emotional problems. Conclusions: Both the telephone and the web-based support improved the children's well-being and decreased their perceived burden of problem. The results of this study underline the need for closer cooperation between <b>child</b> <b>helplines</b> and mental health and child welfare services...|$|E
50|$|From early 2010, the pan-European 116 number range {{came into}} use for social helplines.

40|$|Objective This study {{examined}} the influence of community unemployment and divorce rate on child help-seeking behavior about violence and relationships via a telephone and Internet helpline. Methods Time series analysis was conducted on monthly call volumes to a child helpline (‘De Kindertelefoon’) in the Netherlands from 2003 to 2008 and on the topics discussed (primarily Violence and Relationships) from 1994 to 2008 in answered calls and chats. Results As unemployment rises, the number of calls to the helpline increases. With increased unemployment, the share of conversations about Violence and about Relationships {{is found to be}} higher. When the divorce rate goes up, the number of calls to the helpline increases, but the share of Violence and of Relationships decreases. In addition, the share of contacts about Violence is increasing over time, while the share about Relationships is decreasing. Furthermore, the showing of violent movies is associated with fewer attempted helpline calls. Finally, seasonal variation in call volumes and the shares of calls about Violence and Relationships are found. Conclusion Our data provide a unique and direct perspective on child help-seeking behavior. Our results suggest that more resources need to be devoted to resolving children's problems during times of unemployment as they seek more help particularly with respect to violence. Increased training of counselors with regard to children reporting incidents of violence is particularly important, as the share of contacts about violence is increasing over time and during a recession. Resources are especially needed as, on average, {{less than half of the}} calls to <b>child</b> <b>helplines</b> are actually answered...|$|E
