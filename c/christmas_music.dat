5|$|Weary of {{constantly}} being {{asked for her}} primary genre, Clarkson had long desired to record a Christmas album {{as a means to}} defy genre limitations. She commissioned Kurstin, who had studied jazz music under the tutelage of Jaki Byard, to produce the entire album. Drawing inspirations from the soundtracks to the features A Charlie Brown Christmas and White Christmas, as well as the Christmas albums by Mariah Carey, McEntire, and Phil Spector, they experimented on various styles and sounds using Spector's famed Wall of Sound technique to a create a contemporary holiday theme to classics. The <b>Christmas</b> <b>music</b> of Wrapped in Red comprises a variety of genres such as pop, jazz, country, and soul, marking a departure from the pop rock sound established from Clarkson's previous studio albums, while its lyrics share a singular theme of the color red, which represents a plethora of emotions during the holidays.|$|E
5|$|At 12, Westenra {{entered a}} {{professional}} recording studio to record Walking in the Air, a demo album originally created {{for friends and}} family. At first, her parents paid for 70 copies; soon after, 1,000 more were cut for sale, hand-out, and publicity. After finishing her album, Westenra and her sister Sophie busked in Christchurch, giving away {{a few of the}} original 70 albums (at the behest of passersby) and selling some of the latter 1000. The pair drew large crowds, and one woman asked the girls if they had ever recorded anything. The woman, a journalist with Canterbury Television, asked Westenra to appear on air. Gray Bartlett, the director of a concert promotion company, saw the show and became interested in working with Westenra. Shortly after, she was offered a recording deal with Universal Records New Zealand. On that label, Westenra, who in the meantime was attending Burnside High School, released a self-titled album of show tunes and light classical songs, as well as My Gift to You, a CD of <b>Christmas</b> <b>music.</b> Following the success of her albums, she was offered and later received lessons from Dame Malvina Major.|$|E

25|$|<b>Christmas</b> <b>music</b> is {{a popular}} stunt format, used when a station is {{transitioning}} to a different format. For instance, a rock music station changing to a rhythmic oldies format will often air <b>Christmas</b> <b>music</b> in-between. This can occur at times when <b>Christmas</b> <b>music</b> seems out of place, such as in summer. The end of the calendar year is a common time of year for format switches. As such, <b>Christmas</b> <b>music</b> may be aired for a prolonged period of time from as early as October and/or extend as late as New Year's Day, while the station prepares the switch. Conversely, when 94.9 in Atlanta changed from adult contemporary to country music {{in the middle of}} December 2006, it abruptly stopped playing its annual <b>Christmas</b> <b>music</b> a week before the holiday.|$|E

25|$|<b>Christmas</b> <b>music</b> {{has been}} {{published}} as sheet music for centuries. One of the earliest collections of printed <b>Christmas</b> <b>music</b> was Piae Cantiones, a Finnish songbook first published in 1582 which contained a number of songs that have survived today as well-known Christmas carols. The publication of <b>Christmas</b> <b>music</b> books in the 19th century, such as Christmas Carols, New and Old (Bramley and Stainer, 1871), {{played an important role}} in widening the popular appeal of carols. In the 20th century, Oxford University Press (OUP) published some highly successful <b>Christmas</b> <b>music</b> collections such as The Oxford Book of Carols (Martin Shaw, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Percy Dearmer, 1928), which revived a number of early folk songs and established them as modern standard carols. This was followed by the bestselling Carols for Choirs series (David Willcocks, Reginald Jacques and John Rutter), first published in 1961 and now available in a five volumes. The popular books have proved to be a popular resource for choirs and church congregations in the English-speaking world, and remain in print today.|$|E
