5|$|In October 1962, the US and Soviet Union {{experienced}} the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the two superpowers {{to the edge}} of nuclear war and prompted both Kennedy and Khrushchev to seek accelerated rapprochement. After years of dormant or lethargic negotiations, American and British negotiators subsequently forged a strong working relationship and with Soviet negotiators found common ground on test restrictions later in 1962. After years of pursuing a comprehensive ban, Khrushchev was convinced to accept a partial ban, partly due to the efforts of Soviet nuclear scientists, including Kurchatov, Sakharov, and Yulii Borisovich Khariton, who argued that atmospheric testing had severe <b>consequences</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>health.</b> Khrushchev had been concerned by a partial ban due to the greater US experience in underground tests; by 1962, the US had conducted 89 such tests and the Soviet Union just two (the Soviet focus had been on cheaper, larger-yield atmospheric tests). For this reason, many in the Soviet weapons industry argued that a partial ban would give the US the advantage in nuclear capabilities. Khrushchev would later recount that he saw test-ban negotiations as a prime venue for ameliorating tensions after the crisis in Cuba.|$|E

40|$|The {{possible}} risk <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>health</b> {{arising from}} consumption of lead-polluted shellfish was suggested by experiments on the bioavailability for mice of a "biologically detoxified" {{form of the}} metal. In this work, young mice were fed with a mixed diet including mussels collected in a Pb-polluted area. Metal concentrations in blood, kidney, liver, urine, and feces and the activity of erythrocytic delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase were determined after 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Comparisons were made with mice treated with balanced diet, mixed diet including control mussels, and drinking water with lead dissolved as acetate. In mice fed polluted mussels, lead concentrations increased in blood, kidney, and liver, whereas no significant accumulation was observed in urine. Different responses in mice treated with Pb(CH 3 COO) 2 in drinking water are {{probably due to the}} diversity of lead chemical form in the two treatments.

40|$|This chapter {{tells the}} story of a {{research}} thread that identified and modified a pharmaceutical that could be a component of environmentally benign fouling management coatings. First, I present the background context of biofouling and how fouling is managed. The major target of the research is disrupting transduction of a complex process in all macrofouling organisms: metamorphosis. Using a bioassay directed approach we first identified a pharmaceutical candidate. Then, based on structure function studies coupled with laboratory and field bioassays, we simplified the molecule, eliminating halogens and aromatic rings to a pharmacophore that could be readily broken down by bacteria. Next, we did further structure function studies coupled to lab and field bioassays of modifications that enabled delivery of the molecule in a variety of coatings. The outcome is a different way of thinking about managing fouling and concepts in which molecules are designed to perform a function and then degrade. This work is discussed in the context of existing fouling management approaches and business models which use long-lived broad-spectrum biocides which have <b>consequences</b> <b>for</b> <b>human,</b> environmental <b>health,</b> and food security...|$|R
