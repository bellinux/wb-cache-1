40|$|Validation of claims-based {{algorithms}} {{to identify}} serious hypersensitivity reactions and osteonecrosis of the jaw {{has not been}} performed in large osteoporosis populations. The objective of this project is to estimate the positive predictive value of the claims-based algorithms in older women with osteoporosis enrolled in Medicare. Using the 2006 - 2008 Medicare 5 % sample data, we identified potential hypersensitivity and osteonecrosis of the jaw cases based on ICD- 9 diagnosis codes. Potential hypersensitivity cases had a 995. 0, 995. 2, or 995. 3 diagnosis code on emergency department or inpatient claims. Potential osteonecrosis of the jaw cases had ≥ 1 inpatient or outpatient physician claim with a 522. 7, 526. 4, 526. 5, or 733. 45 diagnosis code or ≥ 2 claims of any type with a 526. 9 diagnosis code. All retrieved records were redacted and reviewed by experts to determine case status: <b>confirmed,</b> <b>not</b> <b>confirmed,</b> or insufficient information. We calculated the positive predictive value {{as the number of}} confirmed cases divided {{by the total number of}} retrieved records with sufficient information. We requested 412 potential hypersensitivity and 304 potential osteonecrosis of the jaw records and received 174 (42 %) and 84 (28 %) records respectively. Of 84 potential osteonecrosis of the jaw cases, 6 were confirmed, resulting in a positive predictive value (95 % CI) of 7. 1 % (2. 7, 14. 9). Of 174 retrieved potential hypersensitivity records, 95 were confirmed. After exclusion of 25 records with insufficient information for case determination, the overall positive predictive value (95 % CI) for hypersensitivity reactions was 76. 0 % (67. 5, 83. 2). In a random sample of Medicare data, a claim-based algorithm to identify serious hypersensitivity reactions performed well. An algorithm for osteonecrosis of the jaw did not, partly due to the inclusion of diagnosis codes that are not specific for osteoporosis of the jaw...|$|E

The main aim {{is on the}} basis of theoretical knowledge and approach of modern psychology especially from the area typology of personality to find an identical and a different characteristic of selected target group. It means in the concrete the group of coaches in Litvinov ice hockey club. For this purpose is elaborated questionary research.

Why is this new and modern way to fit exercise in basketball training. This bachelor thesis acquaints us with basketball in general, with movements that are performed in basketball and the muscles that are involved in these movements. Conclusion The theoretical part contains exercises for each muscle group, their strengthening and stretching that are most involved in basketball and deep stabilization system. In the research section, we used the method of acquiring data through a questionnaire survey, which <b>confirms</b> / <b>not</b> <b>confirmed</b> defined hypotheses. The research results are statistically processed into graphs. Key words: TRX, basketball, summer training, core trainin...|$|R

Finally, if - as expected - you come across factors tend to affect the competitiveness of these portions of land, to produce its real situations of marginalization from the process of development, those are properly considered, trying to find valid solutions among successful reality in other mountain with similar issues...|$|R
40|$|Statins are {{essential}} drugs {{for the prevention}} of coronary artery disease. There is now evidence that they can also prevent ischemic stroke. The protective effect is related to the reduction in total and LDL cholesterol levels and the clinical benefit is especially high in secondary prevention patients with previous stroke and/or transient ischemic accident. The favourable role of statins is less well documented during an acute stroke than during an acute coronary syndrome, and certainly deserves further studies. Besides their specific cholesterol-lowering effect, statins exert various pleiotropic effects, which probably contribute to vascular protection. Furthermore, statins are able to reduce the formation of beta-amyloid peptide, which plays a key-role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. However, currently available results are heterogeneous and could not firmly support a protective effect of statins in dementia in general, neither in Alzheimer disease more specifically, nor in the reduction of cognitive function in the elderly. Several ongoing trials should <b>confirm</b> or <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> this new potential indication of statins in a near future. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Amoxicillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, doxycycline, and {{ofloxacin}} {{were active}} in vitro, like the reference drug streptomycin, against the virulent strain Yersinia pestis 6 / 69 M. The comparative efficacies of these drugs in vivo were evaluated in a standardized and reproducible mouse model of systemic infection. Each antibiotic was injected intravenously once, at 24 h postinfection, and then repeatedly during 48 h. In vivo results were measured by counting the viable bacteria recovered from the whole spleens of mice sacrificed at selected times. All the drugs were manifestly successful; ceftriaxone, ofloxacine, and the reference drug were the most effective. Therefore, gentamicin and doxycycline could be used, depending on the clinical forms of the Y. pestis infection. Further investigations on beta-lactams, especially those {{used in the present}} study, could be carried out to <b>confirm</b> or <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> their activities against Y. pestis. Ofloxacin appeared to be as active and to perform as rapidly as streptomycin in the treatment of murine Y. pestis infection, which is in agreement with the previous successes obtained with the use of fluoroquinolones in the treatment of murine infections caused by other pathogenic yersiniae...|$|R

The second phase was designed to <b>confirm</b> or <b>not</b> to <b>confirm</b> the expectations induced. The third phase tested for the effects on later task behavior. The results indicated that the first phase procedure failed to induce the required expectancies, thus preventing a test of the experimental hypothesis.
