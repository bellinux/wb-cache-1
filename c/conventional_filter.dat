5000|$|In a {{dichroic}} mirror or filter, {{instead of using}} an oil film to produce the interference, alternating layers of optical coatings with different refractive indices are built up upon a glass substrate. The interfaces between the layers of different refractive index produce phased reflections, selectively reinforcing certain wavelengths of light and interfering with other wavelengths. The layers are usually added by vacuum deposition. By controlling the thickness and number of the layers, the frequency (wavelength) of the passband of the filter can be tuned and made as wide or narrow as desired. Because unwanted wavelengths are reflected rather than absorbed, dichroic filters do not absorb this unwanted energy during operation and so do not become nearly as hot as the equivalent <b>conventional</b> <b>filter</b> (which attempts to absorb all energy except for that in the passband). (See Fabry-Pérot interferometer for a mathematical description of the effect.) ...|$|E

50|$|High {{filtration}} rate {{can be obtained}} from producing thin cake. However, a <b>conventional</b> <b>filter</b> press is a batch system and the process must be stopped to discharge the filter cake and reassemble the press, which is time consuming. Practically, maximum {{filtration rate}} is obtained when the filtration time is greater than the time taken to discharge the cake and reassemble the press to allow for cloth's resistance.Properties of the filter cake affect the filtration rate, and it is desirable for the particle's size to be as large as possible to prevent pore blockage by using a coagulant. From experimental work, flow rate of liquid through the filter medium is proportional to the pressure difference. As the cake layer forms, pressure applies to the system increases and the flow rate of filtrate decreases. If the solid is desired, the purity of the solid can be increased by cake washing and air drying.Sample of filter cake can be taken from different locations and weighed to determine the moisture content by using overall material balance.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{uniformity}} in radiological imaging, {{it is recommended that}} the concept of equivalence in shape (quality) and size (quantity) of clinical Xray beams should be used for carrying out the comparative evaluation of image and patient dose. When used under the same irradiation geometry, X-ray beams that are strictly or relatively equivalent in terms of shape and size will produce identical or relatively identical image quality and patient dose. Simple mathematical models and software program EQSPECT. FOR were developed for the comparative evaluation of the performance characteristics in terms of contrast (C), contrast to noise ratio (CNR) and figure-of-merit (FOM = CNR 2 /DOSE) for spectrally equivalent beams transmitted through filter materials referred to as conventional and k-edged. At the same value of operating potential (kVp), results show that spectrally equivalent beam transmitted through <b>conventional</b> <b>filter</b> with higher atomic number (Z-value) in comparison with that transmitted through <b>conventional</b> <b>filter</b> with lower Z-value resulted in the same value of C and FOM. However, in comparison with the spectrally equivalent beam transmitted through filter of lower Z-value, the beam through filter of higher Z-value produced higher value of CNR and DOSE at equal tube loading (mAs) and kVp. Under the condition of equivalence of spectrum, at scaled (or reduced) tube loading and same kVp, filter materials of higher Z-value can produce the same values of C, CNR, DOSE and FOM as filter materials of lower Z-value. Unlike the case of comparison of spectrally equivalent beam transmitted through one <b>conventional</b> <b>filter</b> and that through another <b>conventional</b> <b>filter,</b> {{it is not possible to}} derive simple mathematical formulations for the relative performance of spectrally equivalent beam transmitted through a given <b>conventional</b> <b>filter</b> material and that through kedge filter material...|$|E

40|$|The {{capabilities}} of off-the-shelf consumer electronics are continuously increasing, making them interesting candidates to integrate into industrial visualization systems {{for reducing the}} cost of these systems or speed up development.

40|$|Abstract—We {{have studied}} the {{computational}} complexity asso-ciated with the overcomplete wavelet transform for the commonly used Spline wavelet family. By deriving general expressions for the computational complexity using the <b>conventional</b> <b>filtering</b> imple-mentation, we show that the inverse transform is significantly more costly in computation than the forward transform. To reduce this computational complexity, we propose a new spatial implementa-tion based on the exploitation of {{the correlation between the}} low-pass and the bandpass outputs that is inherent in the overcomplete representation. Both theoretical studies and experimental findings show that the proposed spatial implementation can greatly sim-plify the computations associated with the inverse transform. In particular, the complexity of the inverse transform using the pro-posed implementation can be reduced to slightly less than that of the forward transform using the <b>conventional</b> <b>filtering</b> implemen-tation. We also demonstrate that the proposed scheme allows the use of an arbitrary boundary extension method while maintaining the ease of the inverse transform.
