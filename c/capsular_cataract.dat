Methods: Extra <b>capsular</b> <b>cataract</b> extraction followed by posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation was performed, on 300 eyes of 250 patients. The technique involved was posterior limbal corneal tunnel incision through temporal approach, followed by implantation of PMMA posterior chamber intraocular lens. Visual acuity at the time of discharge, third post operative week and sixth week was recorded. Surgically induced astigmatism was reported. Results: The uncorrected visual acuity at discharge was 6 / 18 or better in 63. 2 % eyes. The best corrected visual acuity was 6 / 9 and better in 96. 0 % subjects at six weeks. Poor visual outcome (< 6 / 60) occurred in 0. 5 % eyes. 0. 4 % subjects had posterior capsule rent followed by vitreous show. There was no increase in against the rule astigmatism, as the corneal incision was given through temporal approach.

Design: Cross-sectional survey based on a retrospective case-control study. Subjects: 40 patient men and women aged 40 - 79 years old with senile cataract and 26 persons without cataract the same age range were selected among the patient referred to the ophthalmic clinic of Motahary Center. Setting: The lens-opacities classification system (LOCS) III was used to grade nuclear, cortical, and posterior sub capsular lens opacities. Fasting blood samples were taken to assess plasma concentra-tions of vitamin C. Food frequency questionnaires were incorporated for recognition of their food habits. Results: Plasma level of vitamin C in cataract patient (0. 9 – 0. 6 mg/dl) were significantly (p< 0. 002) lower than control group (1. 4 – 0. 5 mg/dl). Dietary intake of vitamin C (p< 0. 001), vitamin E (p< 0. 001) and vitamin A (p< 0. 04) in cataract patient were significantly lower than control group.

In September 2013, we searched multiple databases to identify relevant studies including both cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled relative risks (RR) with a 95 % confidence interval (CI). Twelve prospective cohort studies and two RCTs were included. Pooled results from the cohort studies indicated that multivitamin/mineral supplements have a significant beneficial effect in decreasing the risk of nuclear cataracts (RR: 0. 73; 95 % CI: 0. 64 – 0. 82), cortical cataracts (RR: 0. 81; 95 % CI: 0. 68 – 0. 94), and any cataracts (RR: 0. 66; 95 % CI: 0. 39 – 0. 93).

There {{was no significant difference}} between preoperative and postoperative keratometric cylinder or intraocular pressure. Visual acuity of 87. 50 % of patients was ≥ 20 / 40 after surgery. complications included foveopathy (10 eyes), iris transillumination defect (4 eyes), iris chafing (2 eyes), pigmented keratic precipitate (KP) (4 eyes), clinical IOL tilt (6 eyes), endothelial pigment dusting (14 eyes), IOL pigment dusting (17 eyes), iris bowing (6 eyes), IOL decentration (4 eyes), and IOL tilt detected with ultrasonography biomicroscopy (UBM) (4 eyes). IOL pigment dusting was significantly higher in eyes with short axial lengths, high IOL power, small sulcus-to-sulcus (STS) diameter, large STS IOL diameter mismatch, and small anterior chamber depth and angle. Significant relationships were observed between pigmented KP with small STS diameter and large STS IOL diameter mismatch, UBM and clinical IOL tilt with large anterior chamber depth and between iris transillumination defect and STS IOL diameter mismatch.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Typical {{antipsychotic}} drugs, mainly phenothiazines, {{have been}} associated with cataract formation for over forty years. Recently, there has been a concern about atypical antipsychotic drugs' potential for inducing this lenticular pathology. Accordingly, we sought to determine the cataract rate and other ocular side effects in patients on long-term therapy with antipsychotic drugs. METHOD: Eighty outpatients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia from two settings who met pre determined inclusion criteria were submitted to an ophthalmological evaluation for ocular abnormalities with emphasis in the lens and cornea. They were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 52) comprised patients who had been predominantly on typical antipsychotics {{for at least two years}} and group 2 (n = 28) patients who had been predominantly on atypical antipsychotics for at least two years. RESULTS: Cataract was found in 26 patients (33 %) with predominance of anterior <b>capsular</b> <b>cataract.</b> The cataract rate among patients from group 1 (40 %) was higher than among those from group 2 (18 %).

40|$|Purpose: The {{management}} of intralenticular foreign bodies (ILFBs) {{with or without}} cataract has varied {{from time to time}} in the last century. We evaluated the surgical removal of the ILFBs with cataract extraction as a single-stage procedure. Methods: Eight consecutive cases with intralenticular foreign bodies presenting to the trauma centre at our institute, were included in the study. Planned ILFB removal with cataract extraction and IOL implantation as a single-stage procedure was done in all the patients. They were followed up from 2 months to 2 years after the surgery. Results: ILFBs were removed with Kelman-Mcpherson forceps in seven cases and in one it was expressed with the nucleus during extra <b>capsular</b> <b>cataract</b> extraction. Co-existent posterior capsular tears were seen in two eyes, of which only one needed a localized vitrectomy. Posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation was possible without any complication in all the cases. Postoperative uveitis seen in three cases was easily controlled with periocular steroids. Best corrected visual acuity at last examination was 6 / 9 or better in 7 cases and 6 / 12 in one case with posterior capsular opacification. Conclusions: Timing and necessity of ILFB removal may be adjusted according to the foreign body characteristics and associated ocular trauma, choosing, as far as possible, the least traumatic procedure. Use of forceps rather than magnets is safer for the removal of the ILFB. Co-existent posterior capsular tears need to be anticipated and dealt with when encountered...|$|E

40|$|Inducing {{selective}} or targeted cell apoptosis without affecting {{large number}} of neighbouring cells remains a challenge. A plausible method for treatment of posterior capsular opacification (PCO) due to remaining lens epithelial cells (LECs) by reactive chemistry induced by localized single electrode microplasma discharge at top of a needle-like glass electrode with spot size ~ 3 mum is hereby presented. The focused and highly-localized atmospheric pressure microplasma jet with electrode discharge could induce a dose-dependent apoptosis in selected and targeted individual LECs, which could be confirmed by real-time monitoring of the morphological and structural changes at cellular level. Direct cell treatment with microplasma inside the medium appeared more effective in inducing apoptosis (caspase 8 positivity and DNA fragmentation) at a highly targeted cell level compared to treatment {{on top of the}} medium (indirect treatment).

40|$|Secondary visual loss {{occurs in}} {{millions}} of patients due to a wound-healing response, known as posterior capsule opacification (PCO), following cataract surgery. An intraocular lens (IOL) is implanted into residual lens tissue, known as the <b>capsular</b> bag, following <b>cataract</b> removal. Standard IOLs allow the anterior and posterior capsules to become physically connected. This places pressure on the IOL and improves contact with the underlying posterior capsule. New open bag IOL designs separate the anterior capsule and posterior capsules and further reduce PCO incidence. It is hypothesised that this results from reduced cytokine availability due to greater irrigation of the bag. We therefore explored the role of growth factor restriction on PCO using human lens cell and tissue culture models. We demonstrate that cytokine dilution, by increasing medium volume, significantly reduced cell coverage in both closed and open capsular bag models. This coincided with reduced cell density and myofibroblast formation. A screen of 27 cytokines identified nine candidates whose expression profile correlated with growth. In particular, VEGF was found to regulate cell survival, growth and myofibroblast formation. VEGF provides a therapeutic target to further manage PCO development and will yield best results when {{used in conjunction with}} open bag IOL designs...|$|R
40|$|Phakoemulsification as a {{procedure}} is only complete with flexible foldable lens. Preliminary studies show good {{acceptance of the}} procedure though the injector is cumbersome. Phakoemulsification {{has now become a}} reality with advanced instrumentation techniques available. Phakoemulsification has to its greatest advantage the ability to remove a cataract though a 3 mm opening. Not only does this enhance the safety and the speed of healing, but it reduces postoperative astigmatism significantly. However, the very advantages listed above stand negated if the wound is to be opened to 6 mm to accommodate an implant. The extra effort needed as compared to regular extra <b>capsular</b> <b>cataract</b> extraction, the enhanced cost of the instrumentation, the more sophisticated technique needed and the superior magnification devices required were all rendered negative till the flexible lenses made their debut. With foldable lenses, phakoemulsification has come into its own. Thomas Mazaco was first credited with the concept of folding and inserting lenses. The ocular lenses were foldable with a forcep (Faulker Folder) and inserted into the eye through a 4 mm incision. It was a tight fit and the compression exerted by the forceps often left a bend on the lens. These problems led to the manufacture of a injective inserter which was in essence a single metal syringe with a piston, either longitudinal pressure or screw movement. Of these the Bartel injector was perhaps the earliest. Now virtually every company making flexible lenses has come out with an injector. The Staar Softrans injector has proven in my hands to be the most useful of all these devices...|$|E
40|$|Background: Seasonal {{allergic}} conjunctivitis (SAC) {{one of the}} most common ocular immunological disorder affecting wide population. Various classes of drugs are been used to control allergic inflammation. Traditionally topical glucocorticoids have been used for SAC. However, repeated and continuous use of steroids is associated with various complications like increase in intraocular pressure, posterior sub <b>capsular</b> <b>cataract,</b> increased susceptibility for infections and delayed wound healing. Hence the current emphasis is to prefer topical NSAIDs as they are free from various steroid related complications. As there is paucity of information regarding the comparative efficacy of topical steroids and NSAIDs, the present study was taken up. The main objective was to study the comparative efficacy and safety of three topical NSAIDs: flurbiprofen, diclofenac, ketorolac and the topical steroid loteprednol, in SAC. Methods: A prospective, comparative study enrolled 40 patients for SAC. All study drugs were instilled 4 times daily for 4 weeks. Patients were assessed for objective and subjective parameters of inflammation at baseline and weekly intervals for 4 weeks using four point scales, and also observed for any side effects. The anti-inflammatory action was assessed by the change in mean scores from basal and at various intervals.

Eye care personnel {{and other resources}} for eye care delivery are located at the state capital. The state Ministry of Health organized an outreach program. The aim was to operate on 750 cataract patients and measure the visual acuity at two weeks follow up. METHOD: Patients were registered and examined. Cataract patients with accurate four quadrant light projection, briskly reacting pupils and normal intra ocular pressures were selected and had manual extra <b>capsular</b> <b>cataract</b> extraction with posterior chamber intra ocular lens implantation. Post operative medications were administered. Patients were reviewed at 2 weeks follow up after discharge during which their visual acuity was measured and recorded. RESULTS: 868 cataract patients were operated. Thirty {{two percent of the}} patients were blind before surgery and 77 % of these had bilateral cataracts. The proportion of those who had posterior chamber intra ocular lens (PC IOL) was 85 %. The proportion of patients who regained normal vision was 43 % and overall, 94 % had vision of 6 / 60 or, better after surgery compared with 20 % in this category before surgery, (WHO vision category 0 and 1).

It acts as a guide during crucial surgical steps in endothelial keratoplasty, right from scoring of the Descemet membrane to ensuring graft apposition at the end of surgery. The morphological features of the corneal incision in phacoemulsification may be assessed. iOCT is a useful tool in assessing the status of the posterior capsule and may help identify preexisting posterior <b>capsular</b> defects during <b>cataract</b> surgery in various clinical scenarios such as posterior polar cataract, traumatic cataract, and vitrectomized eyes. It allows on-table assessment of the ICL vault and potentially facilitates exchange of ICL in the same sitting in extremes of vault. Ocular surface disorders such as ocular surface squamous neoplasia, pterygium, and dermoid may find an application for iOCT, wherein an iOCT-guided stromal dissection will ensure adequate depth of dissection. Further technological advancements may allow for automatic centration and tracking and address the present limitation of instrument-induced shadowing...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} the long-term clinical outcome of Artisan((R)) aphakia intraocular lens (IOL; Ophtec, Groningen, The Netherlands) implantation in five aphakic eyes of five children, without <b>capsular</b> support, after <b>cataract</b> extraction following penetrating ocular trauma. METHODS: The charts {{of the five}} children were retrospectively reviewed. The data collected included follow-up time, nature of injury, age at cataract extraction and IOL implantation, visual outcome, endothelial cell counts, complications, and subsequent surgical interventions. RESULTS: Average follow-up was 11. 0 years (range, 8. 0 - 14. 6 years). All eyes had a corneal perforation with various degrees of anterior segment injury. Mean patient age at lens extraction was 7. 8 years (range, 5. 6 - 10. 2 years). Mean age at Artisan aphakia IOL implantation was 7. 9 years (range, 5. 7 - 10. 2 years). The best spectacle-corrected visual acuity at last follow-up was 20 / 40 or better in four eyes. Mean endothelial cell loss compared with the healthy fellow eye was 40 %. No patients experienced IOL dislocation, corneal decompensation, chronic anterior uveitis, cystoid macular edema, or iris atrophy. One eye had a retinal detachment 19 months after primary injury and needed vitreoretinal surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The Artisan aphakia IOL offers a useful alternative for correction of traumatic childhood aphakia. Although we only have results of {{a small number of}} patients, taking into account our long follow-up period, we feel that implantation of the Artisan aphakia IOL can be considered a treatment option in aphakic eyes of children that lack capsular support due to traum...|$|R
40|$|Posterior capsular {{opacification}} is the opacity {{which follows}} after extra <b>capsular</b> <b>cataract</b> extraction {{and can be}} treated by surgery or laser. The laser is the procedure of choice because it is non invasive, outpatient procedure that clears visual axis and improves vision instantaneously. Aims: The {{aim of this study}} is to correlate density of Posterior capsular opacification in relation to visual deterioration and subsequent improvement after Nd: YAG laser, amount of energy required to cut the posterior capsule and to observe any complications during and after the procedure. Methods: It was a prospective study which was carried out over a period of two years. 40 eyes with posterior capsular opacification were included. Visual acuity and intraocular pressure were recorded before and after the procedure. Result: After the YAG capsulotomy 85 % patients showed improvement by 3 snellen’s line or more while 12. 5 % patients improved by 2 snellen’s line or more and remaining 2. 5 % patients showed 1 snellen’s line improvement. The average energy required per shot to break the posterior capsule was 3. 08 (± 1. 12) mj. Average total energy used in our study is 50. 13 ± 22. 32 mj. The 77. 5 % patients had no significant rise of IOP while 15 % patients had rise of 2. 2 to 5 mmHg and 7. 5 % patients had rise of IOP of 5 to 10 mmHg after YAG capsulotomy. 7. 5 % cases had IOL damage in the form of pitting but there were no visual complaints, 5 % patients had mild iritis and 2. 5 % patient had iris bleed...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of Manual Small Incision Cataract Surgery (MSICS) in cases of white cataract {{with the use of}} trypan blue as an adjunct for performing continuous curvilinear capsulorthexis (CCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective observational study on 100 consecutive eyes of 100 patients with white cataract who had undergone MSICS with trypan blue assisted CCC. The nucleus was prolapsed into anterior chamber by using a sinskey hook and extracted out of the eye using irrigating vectis. Intraoperative and postoperative findings (according to OCTET classification) as well as postoperative visual outcomes were used as main measures to report {{the safety and}} efficacy of the surgery. RESULTS: Of the 100 eyes, 16 had intumescent, 67 had mature and 17 had hypermature cataract. Intraoperatively CCC was incomplete in 4 eyes (4 &#x 0025;) and had to be converted to canopener capsulotomy. None of the eyes had posterior capsular rupture or zonular dialysis and no eyes were converted to conventional Extra <b>Capsular</b> <b>Cataract</b> Extraction (ECCE). Postoperatively, 6 eyes (6 &#x 0025;) developed corneal oedema with > 10 Descemets folds and 7 eyes (7 &#x 0025;) had corneal oedema with < 10 Descemets folds. Mild iritis was seen in 6 eyes (6 &#x 0025;) and moderate iritis with fibrin membrane was seen in 3 eyes (3 &#x 0025;). Iridodialysis was observed in 1 eye (1 &#x 0025;). Of the 99 patients (99 &#x 0025;) categorised under good visual outcomes category, 94 patients (94 &#x 0025;) had a best-corrected visual acuity of 6 / 9 or better on the 40 th post-operative day. CONCLUSION: In developing countries like India where phacoemulsification may not be affordable to a majority of those requiring cataract surgery, MSICS proves to be a safe and efficacious alternative for white cataracts especially with the adjunctive use of trypan blue dye...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{surgical}} outcome of triple procedure as penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) with conventional extra <b>capsular</b> <b>cataract</b> extraction (ECCE) with posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) implantation {{in patients with}} both central corneal opacity and advanced cataract at rural set up. Introduction: When corneal opacity and cataract present together then well-established and effective triple procedure is indicated. Prognosis for a clear graft is good in triple, as graft endothelium does not touch the hard nucleus which may occur in two steps or sequential surgery. It provides faster visual rehabilitation. Being single step procedure it reduces patient’s hospital stay, postoperative care and follows up visits. Methodology: In this hospital based observational, three years longitudinal study, we studied the surgical outcome of relatively rare one step triple procedure as PKP with conventional ECCE with PCIOL implantation in sulcus or in bag, in patients with both central corneal opacity and advanced cataract at rural set up. The outcome measures included graft clarity on slit lamp, postoperative unaided visual acuity with Snellen’s chart and the occurrence of postoperative complications after taking IEC permission and informed written consent in local language from study patients. Results: Out of 13 study patients mean age was 61. 15 yrs (Range 50 - 80 yrs). Follow up range was 9 - 34 months. At final follow up 9 patients (69. 23 %) had clear grafts and 61. 52 % patients gained visual acuity > 6 / 24. Graft failure {{was the most common}} post operative complication in 30. 76 % followed by Posterior capsular opacification (PCO) in 15. 38 % patients which was treated well with YAG laser capsulotomy. Conclusion: Triple procedure gives good results in respect to graft clarity, unaided vision, and faster rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{screen for}} {{sequence}} {{variations in the}} IDO gene that encodes indoleamine 2, 3 - dioxygenase (IDO), the first rate limiting enzyme involved in the tryptophan catabolism which results {{in the production of}} UV filters playing a role in the maintenance of lens transparency. Methods: We conducted a case-control study to screen for sequence changes in the IDO gene and associated demographic risk factors in patients with nuclear (NC- 110), cortical (CC- 110) and Posterior sub <b>capsular</b> (PSC- 111) <b>cataracts</b> in comparison to normal controls (210) from Hyderabad, India. Results: Among the cataract types studied high risk was observed for CC and PSC types in female patients, individuals with low body mass index and smoking habit. Cataract development had early onset more frequently in cases of PSC followed by CC and NC. Screening by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) revealed mobility shifts in 6 of the 331 patient (3 with NC and 3 with PSC) samples which upon sequencing confirmed the presence of G→A transition (c. 422 + 90 G→A; rs 4613984) in the intron downstream to exon 4 of IDO which was further tested by RFLP anlaysis using the HhaI restriction enzyme. Of the 6 patients, one with nuclear cataract showed homozygosity and the remaining five showed heterozygosity for the substitution. None of the control samples showed this variation. Conclusions: It is possible that the substitution c. 422 + 90 G→A; rs 4613984 in an intron downstream to exon 4 of IDO may be related with cataract formation among the aged...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} outcome of removal of {{retained}} intraocular foreign bodies (RIOFBs) via limbus using 23 -gauge transconjunctival sutureless vitrectomy (TSV). Materials and Methods: In this prospective, non-comparative interventional case series, fourteen eyes of 14 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were enrolled. They underwent 23 -gauge TSV for management of posterior segment RIOFB and reviewed at 1 day, 7 days, 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months. Eyes with penetrating eye injury involving cornea or limbus (corneal injury not so severe to hinder vitrectomy), cataract associated with anterior and/or posterior <b>capsular</b> tear requiring <b>cataract</b> surgery and posterior segment RIOFB with minimal posterior segment involvement were included. Main outcome measures include success in removal of RIOFB without enlarging sclerotomy, ability to preserve capsular support, improvement in visual acuity and complications, if any. Results: All eyes underwent the successful RIOFB removal through limbal port without enlarging scleral ports. None of the eyes required suturing of the sclera, cornea or conjunctiva. Anterior capsular rim could be preserved in all eyes except one. Postoperatively follow up ranged from one year in 8, 6 months in 4 and 3 months in 2 eyes. The mean logMAR visual acuity at 3, 6, and 12 months showed significant improvement. There were no intraoperative complications. Postoperative complications include microscopic hyphema and loose blood in vitreous cavity in one eye. Conclusion: The advantages of 23 -gauge TSV for removal of RIOFB may {{be passed on to}} select cases. RIOFB removal through limbal route obviated the need for scleral port enlargement and preserved capsular support for early visual rehabilitation...|$|R
40|$|Bob Z Wang, Elsie Chan, Rasik B Vajpayee The Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; Centre for Eye Research Australia, University of Melbourne, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia Background: The {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} preoperative indications, intraoperative procedures, and outcomes of capsular tension ring (CTR) insertion during cataract surgery. Methods: A review of all patients undergoing cataract surgery with insertion of a CTR between July 2000 and June 2010 was conducted at The Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, a large tertiary teaching hospital in Victoria, Australia. Information relating to each patient&# 39;s demographic details, preoperative assessment, surgical procedure, and postoperative assessment were obtained. Results: Eighty-four eyes of 82 patients were included in this study. The main indications for CTR insertion were previous trauma, pseudoexfoliation syndrome, and mature cataracts. Twenty-one eyes (25. 0 %) {{did not have any}} obvious preoperative indication. A posterior capsule tear was the most common intraoperative complication (3. 6 %). An intraocular lens was successfully implanted in the bag in 72 eyes (85. 7 %). Postoperatively, the most common complications were a decentered intraocular lens (8. 3 %) and persistent corneal edema (6. 0 %). Overall, 61 eyes (72. 6 %) had better postoperative visual acuity compared with preoperative acuity, with 67 patients (79. 8 %) achieving vision of 20 / 40 or better. Conclusion: For the majority of cases, CTR use in complex cataract surgeries is associated with improved postoperative outcomes. CTR implantation is most commonly required in patients with known risk factors for zonular instability.
