40|$|The U. K. ’s {{public sector}} {{modernization}} agenda has significant implications for human resource (HR) practices {{and how they}} contribute to organizational per-formance. Through 4 case studies of large, local authorities, this article considers how the externally imposed performance assessment process of best value review is affecting HR practices in local government {{and to what extent}} these are being developed to support the high-performance model reflected in <b>central</b> <b>govern-ment</b> performance interventions. It also explores whether these are helping or hindering approaches to the organizational development required to build the internal capability necessary for delivering local authorities ’ future improvement plans...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: During {{the period}} under {{consideration}} (1438 – 1532) the Inca state in Peru was politically a highly centralized empire with strong <b>central</b> <b>govern-ment.</b> Its social structure {{was that of}} an early class society with some commu-nal traits; the government’s intervention in social life was prevalent, village communities were put {{in the service of}} the government, horizontal mobility was regulated and vertical mobility was all but non-existent. It represented a so-called early totalitarian state. The Aztec state in Mexico, during the period under consideration (1427 – 1519), was a confederation with weak central authority where the core of the confederation used conquered territories as a sort of economic backup. Their social organization represented an early class society with strong communal traits, little interference from the government in the daily life of the community, few opportunities for horizontal mobility, but vertical mobility was quite possi-ble. As such it was a state that had retained many features of a military democ-racy...|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{the opening}} {{decades of the}} nineteenth century <b>central</b> <b>govern-ment</b> was bombarded with pamphlets, speeches and general {{political}} pres-sures to investigate and reform the operation of the poor laws. 1 Yet root and branch national poor law reform was never attempted. It was from the widespread violence in much of southern England (and elsewhere in the country) in 1830 - 31 that renewed concern developed about how poor relief was administered. The ‘Swing Riots ’ and the coming to power of a new Whig government precipitated the Commission of Enquiry into the Poor Laws in 1832, although a disposition to reform was already detect-able. 2 The resulting investigation was the largest and most detailed socio-logical investigation at that time. Twenty-six investigators visited around 3, 000 parishes and townships (out of 15, 000) throughout England and Wales, mainly in late 1832. These assistant commissioners were aided by an elaborate questionnaire referring to, amongst other things, pauper costs, population size, number of labourers required, the presence of Scottish an...|$|E

This paper addresses the issues of whether and how economic integration can affect {{the ability of the}} <b>central</b> <b>govern-ments</b> to raise tax revenues and lead to a greater decentralisation of the public sector. To this purpose, a country-specific measure of tax erosion is derived. That is used as a determinant of the degree of fiscal federalism. We find that an in-crease of economic integration causes a decline of the implicit tax rates on mobile capital and the process of tax erosion positively contributes to the growth of public sector decentralisation...|$|R
40|$|What is {{the future}} of China’s {{financial}} sector? Will it continue to be stable? Will it be more efficient? In addressing those questions, we need to review China’s financial system of the reform era (1978 to the present). I argue that the key feature of that system has been a mild financial repression that has helped China maintain the financial sta-bility needed for reform. But the repression has been inflicting in-creasing costs in terms of lowering economic efficiency. Moreover, having been implemented by various policies in the reform era, Chi-na’s financial repression tends to be self-propelling and self-sustaining, creating a low-efficiency trap that prevents financial sector liberalization. In order to beat the trap, I argue that the ongoing financial reform must aim at breaking up the dominant state banks into smaller, manageable independent banks. Alternative reform strategies aimed at restructuring state banks are likely to be futile. To achieve the objective of breaking up the largest state banks, two preconditions must be satisfied and should be the focus of the current reform. The first precondition is to restructure the <b>central</b> <b>govern-ment’s</b> public finances, and the second is to properly deal with the nonperforming loans of the state banks. Financial Repression as an Expedient Reform in China Financial repression refers to a policy regime that creates a wedge between the actual rate of return to financial assets and the nominal rate of return to the investors. As a result, incentives to hold financial assets are reduced and the development of the economy’s financia...|$|R
40|$|Spain has an advanced, {{integrated}} {{health care}} system that has achieved remarkable results, including substantially improved health outcomes, over a relatively short time. Measures introduced by <b>central</b> and regional <b>govern-ments</b> to combat the financial crisis may be severely affecting the health sector, with proposed changes potentially threatening the principles of equity and social cohesion underlying the welfare state. This article examines recent developments in Spanish health care, focusing on the austerity measures introduced since 2010. In Spain, as in other countries, evaluation of health care changes is difficult due to the paucity of data and because the effects of measures often lag well behind their introduction, meaning the full effects of changes on access to care or health outcomes only become apparent years later. However, some effects are already clear. With exceptions, Spain has not used the crisis as an opportunity to increase efficiency and quality, rationalize and reorganize health services, increase productivity, and regain public trust. We argue that immediate health care cuts {{may not be the best}} long-term answer and suggest evidence-driven interventions that involve the portfolio of free services and the private sector, while ensuring that the most vulnerable are protected. FROM PLENTY TO CRISIS The ongoing economic recession has had severe consequences for Spain. Although gross domestic product (GDP) rose more than 5 percent annually at the beginning of this century, the 2007 collapse of the construction-led and debt-financed boom saw the stock market fall from 125 percent of GDP i...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} an {{evaluation}} of the housing management performance indicators regime in the United Kingdom is provided. First, the context in which performance measurement in the housing service in the United Kingdom has developed is set and lessons are drawn from the use of statutory indicators following the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. By examining the performance indicator regime in Wales it is suggested that the regime is flawed because it provides information which points towards the economic efficiency of service provision rather than explaining the effectiveness of services. This is compounded by the multiple audience that the performance indicator regime is targeted at: tenants, local government, and <b>central</b> <b>govern-ment.</b> The conflict arising from the multiple target groups results in the regime being unable to serve properly its primary audience, that is, tenants. To conclude the paper, some alternatives are suggested, and the need for performance indicators to be seen as tools for evaluating the relative efficiency and effectiveness of local authority housing management over time is highlighted. ...|$|E
40|$|This article uses a {{regression}} discontinuity design in close electoral races to disclose purely politicalreasons in {{the allocation of}} intergovernmental transfers in a federal state. We identify the effectof political alignment on federal transfers to municipal governments in Brazil, and find that—in preelection years—municipalities inwhich themayor is affiliatedwith the coalition (and especiallywith the political party) of the Brazilian president receive approximately one-third larger discretionary transfers for infrastructures. This effect is primarily driven {{by the fact that}} the federal government penalizes municipalities run by mayors from the opposition coalition who won by a narrow margin, thereby tying their hands for the next election. In a federal state, transfers from the <b>central</b> <b>govern-ment</b> to local governments are crucial ingredientsboth for the efficient provision of public goods and for political competition. Several theoretical and em-pirical studies have documented that the allocation of intergovernmental transfers responds to the incentives of politicians. Although federations usually adopt rules aimed at sheltering the distribution of central transfers from political distortions, elected officials have signifi-cant discretion in using transfers to cultivate swing vot-ers, reward core supporters, or build political alliances. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{many parts}} of the former Soviet Union, demands have been raised for {{increased}} independence from the <b>central</b> <b>govern-ment.</b> These demands often refer to very small territorial en-tities which were part of the old Russian republic, sometimes they are based on the earlier existence of an administrative region of one kind or another. The Soviet Union contained a number of such regions or territories which had mostly been formed on the basis of nationality. Today, many of these terri-tories have obtained an official status (most commonly what is now simply called a “republic”) allowing them a certain degree of self-government or autonomy. No doubt, the reasons for the seemingly strong desire to obtain a form of autonomy {{have something to do with}} the his-tory of the last 70 years of Communist Party rule. With the break-down of the traditional, long-standing communist rule a wide array of political and non-political forces were all of a sudden released and set in motion, not only in the former USSR, but all over Eastern Europe. Nationalistic tendencies could be observed everywhere. Since this happened, the East European economy has been in a state of flux with consequen-ces from which no one could escape. In the political vacuu...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the mechanics of}} establishing a voluntary, incentive-based integrated coastal management program inIndonesia {{that is consistent with}} the newly established laws relating to decentralization. It first offers a close analysis ofthose laws, specifically Act No. 22 / 1999 and its implementing Regulation No. 25 / 2000 regarding management au-thorities, and Act No. 25 / 1999 and its implementing Regulation 104 / 2000 regarding financial relations and financial manage-ment. The paper then discusses why these new laws increase the need for a vertically and horizontally integrated coastal resource management (ICRM) program in Indonesia. Lastly, the paper describes how a program can be developed under decentralization. The paper proposes a voluntary program in which the central government establishes standards and guidelines for developing provincial and district ICRM programs. In addition to developing standards, the central government would also put in place specific programs providing incentives available to provinces and districts that prepare a ICRM plans in accordance with these standards and guidelines. After coordination with relevant village and provincial governments, the districts, through the provincial government, would submit their plan for approval by the central government. Upon approval, the <b>central</b> <b>govern-ment</b> would provide technical and financial assistance, and as additional incentive, would commit to adhering to the regional plan itself. The paper further identifies sources of discretionary funding available to the central government to use for financing such a program...|$|E
40|$|Despite government’s {{efforts in}} curbing prices, {{the health care}} cost in China remains high in {{comparison}} to its GDP due to the real absence of regulatory and supervisory mechanisms. We randomly studied patients who attended two different emergency rooms in two teaching hospitals, mainly complaining of TIA, stroke and CVA. From this study we found {{there is a significant}} difference in test fees, total fees and percentage of test fees. This difference in total cost of treatment is due to variation of loci lesions. There {{was no significant difference in}} drug fees or percentage of fees between two genders. Hence, the central and local govern-ments need to implement further policies in order to reduce or stabilise the health care costs, such as gradual increase in doctors ’ wages to decrease the deliverance of unnecessary care, partial privatisation of medical insurance enterprises, placing representatives for insurance companies in the hospitals, encouraging generic pharmaceutical manufacturing, improved distribution of hi-tech medical equipment, and better control of medical bills. Historical Aspects of Health Coverage in China Three decades between 1950 and 1980 witnessed the establishment of a system by the Chinese government that provided free health care to all its citizens at reasonable prices by covering only basic medical health services (Gao et al. 2001; State Council of China 1998; Tang et al. 1994). In urban areas health service delivery was funded and managed by the <b>central</b> <b>govern-ment</b> through a government insurance scheme (GIS) and labour insuranc...|$|E
40|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, the Dutch economy {{underwent}} {{a transition from}} a stag¬nant mercantilist system to a dynamic system of production, based on indus¬try and modern services. The path this transformation took, and its exact timing are not yet fully understood. In this study, I investigated two probable deter¬¬minants of the process, namely capital formation, and infrastructure. The central question had the following two elements: (1) “What was the annual value of capital formation and the capital stock in infrastructure in the Nether¬lands in the period 1800 - 1913 ”; and: (2) “Which were the macro¬economic consequences of this?” In conclusion, {{it is argued that}} between 1866 and 1888 infrastructural capital formation created Rostowian ‘preconditions for take-off. ’ Led by the <b>central</b> <b>govern-ment,</b> large investments took place in ‘heavy’ infrastructure. This created opportunities for further economic development. Econometric analysis provides strong evidence that these opportunities have indeed been taken. The existence of a strong causal link leading from infrastructural investment to the growth of GDP could be proven with a vector autoregression model based on the concept of Granger causality. Yet, {{it would be a mistake}} to regard infrastructure as homogenous. The subdivision of infra¬structure displayed new perspectives. These included a further phase of growth, taking place after 1903, which was driven by domestic demand, and based on ‘light’ utilities. This conclusion is important not only for gaining insight into the dynamics of nineteenth century infrastructural capital for¬mation, but also for modern analysis of the possible role of infrastructure in the process of economic growth...|$|E
