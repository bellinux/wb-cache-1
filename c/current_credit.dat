50|$|Figures {{of total}} debt {{typically}} {{do not include}} other financial obligations such as derivatives.

50|$|The measure {{preferred}} by the Office of the Comptroller is net <b>current</b> <b>credit</b> exposure (NCCE), which measures {{the risk to}} banks and the financial system in derivatives contracts. The net <b>current</b> <b>credit</b> exposure (NCCE) of American financial institutions to derivatives {{in the first quarter}} of 2010 to $359 billion or 2.5% of GDP, down from $800 billion at the end of 2008 in the wake of the global financial crisis, when it stood at 5.5% of GDP. The difference between the market value of US derivatives and the credit exposure to the financial system is due to netting - financial institutions tend to have many positions with their counterparties that have positive and negative values, resulting in a much smaller exposure than the sum of the market values of their derivative positions. Netting reduces the credit exposure of the US financial system to derivatives by more than 90%, as compared to 50.6% at the beginning of 1998.|$|E
