50|$|On January 24, 1962, an {{explosive}} eruption occurred, accompanied by lava extrusion {{and the construction}} of a cinder cone about 98 ft high at Sirius Point on the north flank of Kiska Volcano, 1.9 mi from the summit of the main <b>cone</b> (<b>Anchorage</b> Daily News, January 30, 1962). A second eruption that produced a lava flow was reported to have occurred on March 18, 1964 (Bulletin of Volcanic Eruptions, 1964).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a mechanical model for cone bolts by analysing the <b>cone</b> <b>anchorage</b> {{function as a}} wedge-style mechanical anchor. Analytical and numerical methods were employed. The failure of a cone bolt commences {{with a series of}} partial shear failure through the grout around the cone, followed by bolt slipping as the actual bearing angle of the bolt decreases to a small value. The theoretical prediction is in good agreement with experimental data in the literature. The effect of the cone 2 Ì† 7 s geometric face angle was also analysed with respect to the bond strength...|$|E
40|$|DE 3149881 A UPAB: 19930925 The implant has a body (1) with a {{shoulder}} (2) and an internal cylindrical cutout (3) {{to accept the}} connecting piece. A pin (4) has a full length thread (5) which accepts a rotation ball (6) and a connecting cone (7) and which has an elastic guide cap (8) at its lower end. The whole assembly is elastically fixed in place by a foam cement (9). After screwing on the connecting cone (7) the pin (4) is cut off flush. An external cone (10) with retention pins (11) is then put on the inner cone (7) and an impression made in the usual way from which a false tooth can be made. By means of the inner (7) and outer (10) <b>cones</b> a good <b>anchorage</b> is made of the false tooth to the implant. 5 /...|$|R
