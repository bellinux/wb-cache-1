Released as his first compact disc in 1991, it features in excess of 45 minutes of Palestine forcefully playing two notes in rapid alternation, slowly expanding into clusters, with the sustain pedal depressed throughout. As the music swells (and the piano gradually detunes), the harmonics build and the listener <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> variety of timbres rarely produced by the piano.|$|E

Diaz and the other victims had been cleaning 'rust' from the helmet several nights earlier, and Simmons deduces {{that they were all}} infected with an alien virus. Coulson helps Diaz come to terms with his situation, before leaving him to die. Aboard the Bus (the plane that serves as the agents' mobile base) the team are transporting the helmet to the Sandbox, a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, when Coulson realizes that Simmons has been infected as well. She gives herself only 2 hours to live, but the plane is above the Atlantic Ocean and at least 3 hours from land. Agent Felix Blake at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters orders Coulson to dump her off the plane rather than risk the safety {{of the rest of the}} team, but Coulson refuses. Rather than let the rest of the team die, Simmons jumps out of the plane herself; moments later, Fitz discovers an antidote for the virus. Ward jumps after her with a parachute and the cure, saving her life.|$|E
