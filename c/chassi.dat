Logistics chain of animals comprises collecting from farms, transport, unloading and slaughter chain operations. The current licentiate thesis deals with transport of pigs and cattle from farms to abattoirs including all logistics chain. Two trucks with natural ventilation and air suspension systems were used for field experiments. Stress hormones such as cortisol, glucose, lactate and creatine kinease, ethological parameters, carcass pH value, temperature and relative humidity were measured to study effect of transport on pigs welfare. Vibration levels on <b>chassi,</b> floor and cattle were studied and the influence of speeds, road types and cattle standing orientations on vibration levels were investigated. Field measurements were also conducted to describe the potential effect of operations planning and route optimization on welfare and meat quality. Highest pH 24 value was (5. 990. 29) at 12 h summer transport time. Concentrations of cortisol was inversely proportional (P< 0. 001) to transport time, lactate and creatine kinase (P< 0. 002) positively correlated where as glucose level (P< 0. 01) was highest at 8 h transport time. Lying, sitting and rooting correlated with transport time (P< 0. 009). On cattle, highest vibration was 2. 27 ± 0. 33 m s- 2 during transport on gravel road at 70 km h- 1.

This is done to see that the product withstands the applied force from a person. The project result is a updated version on the ingress module where the footboard is easily change without having to remove any parts of the module. What has happened is that the footstep is divided in to two parts, one frame that’s mounted on the <b>chassi</b> on the truck and one footboard that is mounted on the frame. That meant that the plastic cover hade to be change as well as the footsteps. The assembly line for this new ingress module is almost identical to what it is today besides the footboard that’s added. The weight has been reduced with 15 % without doing any bigger changes on the assembly line or adding cost (if not counting for new tools). ...|$|E

Production leveling is achieved by smoothing the entire order intake of the period in consideration of both volume and production mix. Scania <b>Chassi</b> sees the need to level the after line production, Fit For Use, and therefore needs to define what production leveling for the FFU-production is. Thus, {{by being able to}} manage the variation that occurs the company sees the opportunity to achieve an increased flow- and resource efficiency. This study aims to develop a planning tool that ensures a leveled production and increase the delivery reliability for the after line productions, Light and Heavy. This is a quantitative study on Scania Chassis after line productions in which a smoothed flow could be defined as level loading and a predictable flow". By identifying the type of variation that causes the unleveled production today a planning tool was developed to manage the variation. Furthermore, recommendations regarding how Scania should work to achieve a predictable and proactive planning was given. These recommendations included both a standard for the planning tool, but also further development opportunities for both long- and short term. For Heavy a visual level loading tool was established as a prerequisite to achieve a leveled production. As the tool ensures that the technical limitations of the production is not exceeded, it also contributes to an increased delivery reliability. To achieve a leveled production and ensure delivery reliability for Light, a planning tool based on two optimization models were developed. The planning tool was validated both theoretically and through a practical implementation. Results showed that the value-adding time in the FFU-production was increased by 15 %. Thus, the planning tool contributed to increase the flow efficiency. Also, by identifying the waste in the production the planning tool constitutes a foundation to increase the resource efficiency in a long term. ...|$|E

40|$|Ferruform AB in Luleå is a {{manufacturer}} of <b>chassi</b> components for Scania’s truck production. At the department for Axle production sheet metal is processed to produce rear axle housings. The main processes include shearing, forming, welding and machining. High amount of residual stresses are built up in the material because of the extensive weld operations. Residual stresses are reduced with a very time and energy consuming heat treatment method called heat stress relief. The purpose with this thesis was to investigate alternative methods for heat stress relief and then suggest the best solution for Ferruform. Our main tasks in this thesis has been literature studies, investigation of prior work, market analysis, contact and visits from suppliers, production tests and weekly meetings with our supervisor. Finally we have presented the thesis verbally at the company and at Luleå University of Technology. A written report has also been made. Two alternative methods for heat stress relief has been found and further investigated. Tests have been made regarding these two methods for stress relief. One test with a method called vibratory stress relief and one test with a simulated bend-straightening operation. Layouts have been created to easier visualize the space required for the different methods. Seen from the layouts is that both methods requires less space than the heat stress relief oven. Single piece flow is achieved with bend-straightening and batched flow is achieved with vibratory stress relief. Bend-straightening provides single batch flow, low cycle times and is utilized by a competitor, therefore it is recommended as a primary option to heat stress relief at Ferruform. However, verification tests {{have to be made}} in order to evaluate the effects of the two different alternative methods. We have suggested that a fatigue test with spectrum loads should be carried out {{in order to get a}} reliable result.

40|$|Real world {{modeling}} {{has become}} a very useful tool when new designs and applications are tested before they are introduced on the market. A field that recently has discovered the possible use of modeling is reliability prediction. The reliability and lifetime of a component has until recently been based on months and years of testing. In order to shorten the test time {{it is possible to}} simulate the environmental effect on the components. Another advantage of modeling is that changes of large systems where many different components work together can easily be studied. Without modeling the reliability has to be tested over and over again if the system is redesigned since {{it is impossible to know}} how the new change will affect the reliability. Since electronic circuits are being made smaller and smaller with the increasing demand of faster technology the circuits are very vulnerable to corrosion. A trend in the automotive industry is also to move the electronic devices from the benign environment in the cab to the hash environment on the driveline or the <b>chassi.</b> The most common way to protect the electronics from the hash environment is to put it into a protective covering, also called Electronic Control Unit (ECU). Even though the ECU is sealed, water can still enter the ECU in several ways and cause serious damages by corrosion. The corrosion rate of a component is among others depending of the environmental humidity and temperature. Knowing the humidity and temperature are therefore very important to be able to eliminate corrosion problems. In order to achieve a better understanding of the physics behind the failure and to improve the reliability of the ECU a model of the temperature and humidity penetration is built in this thesis. There are several components in the ECU which all responds differently to water vapour. By measuring the humidity penetration in the ECU while components were added one by one, the physical properties of the components could be determined. Some properties were also determined through additional solubility measurements. The humidity penetration of the ECU is then predicted by inserting these properties into mathematical models in SimulinkÓ. The conclusion is that it is possible to model the humidity penetration and the temperature changes in the ECU. After the physical properties of the components were determined, the diffusion model agreed well with measurements. The numerical method used in this thesis has been found to be fast and stable. The length of the time-steps has been varied from a couple of minutes to more than an hour in the numerical model. A few physical properties has to be examined more in detailed and the model is then going to be a good foundation on which corrosion and other damaging processes can be modelled...|$|E

The aim is to improve the mechanical strength, maintaining the formability, low weight of the structure and impact strength, typical of this kind of steel, allowing the reduction in thickness / weight loss without losing dent resistance. The temperature and time parameters used were based on the aging processes known for Dual Phase and TRIP (Transformation Induced Plasticity) steels since information for the Complex Phase is not well reported. The tests were performed on the material as supplied, and the parameters used were pre-strain of 2 % ± 1, aging temperatures ranging from 25 to 180 ºC for periods ranging from 300 to 9. 000. 000 seconds. Microstructure and mechanical properties of material were analyzed to define the best condition for the aging of Complex Phase Steel through tensile and hardness tests, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy was observed a increased resistance around 890 MPa without a significant loss of ductility.

40|$|Behovet av en mer mobil granatkastare har resulterat i en utredning av möjliga koncept som sedan ska gallras bort och resultera i en investering i ett nytt fordonsmonterat granatkastarsystem. Denna rapport beskriver utredningen av en potentiell risk med ett av de potentiella koncepten. Konceptet består av att placera en granatkastare i {{personal}}utrymmet i en stridsfordon 90 -vagn och avfyra den med öppna takluckor. Detta koncept har använts av andra länder och deras arméer, bland dem finns USA som använder sig av fordonsplattformen Stryker. Säkerheten för soldaterna i Försvarsmakten är högt prioriterat och strängt reglerat av standarder och reglementen som ständigt revideras. Den största potentiella risken med det aktuella konceptet har identifierats att vara ljudtrycksnivån som soldaterna utsätts för vid avfyrning. Om en undersökning av ljudtrycksnivåerna skulle visa att konceptet inte är säkert så finns därmed inget behov att vidare utreda konceptet och det skulle därmed bli uteslutet. För att fastställa vilka nivåer som kan förväntas av denna lösning så planerades och genomfördes en testskjutning med hjälp av FMV Test och Evaluering i Karlsborg samt representanter från BAE Systems Hägglunds. Provskjutningen genomfördes genom att placera den svenska 120 mm granatkastaren M/ 41 i ett testchassi, som i stora drag motsvarar Strf 90 chassiet, och sedan skjuta granater i flera olika testscenarion för att undersöka parametrarna elevation, laddning, riktning, användning av tratt, vinkel på takluckor öppen/stängd bakre lucka samt upphöjt <b>chassi.</b> Provet visade att dubbla hörselskydd {{kommer att}} behövas inne i fordonet och att potentiellt kommer personal längst in i fordonet att klara sig med enkla hörselskydd. Högst troligt är att det slutgiltiga konceptet kommer att ha en begränsning på 30 - 50 avfyrningar per dag med högsta laddning, 40 - 50 med laddning 7 och 70 - 80 med laddning 5. Användning av en tratt visade sig effektivt och minskade ljudtrycksnivån med 5 - 10 dB och därmed ökar antalet tillåtna avfyrningar till över 100 skott per dag för högsta laddningen. The {{need of a}} more mobile mortar {{has led to an}} investigation of possible concepts which will be narrowed down and end in a purchase of a self-propelled mortar system. This report describes the exploration of a possible risk with one of these concepts. The concept is to place a mortar in the back storage area of a CV 90 where it will be fired with open hatches. This concept has been used by other countries armies, amongst them the US Army which uses the Stryker vehicle platform. The safety of the personnel in the Swedish Army is prioritized and strictly regulated by set standards and regulations which are frequently revised. The largest potential risk with the concept in question has been identified to be the sound pressure acting on the personnel. If the concept would indicate levels over the permissible levels it would not have any potential and would not be further investigated. To conclude which levels a concept like this would have, a test shooting was planned and conducted with the help from FMV Test and Evaluation centre in Karlsborg and representatives from BAE Systems HägglundsThe shooting was conducted by placing the Swedish 120 mm mortar GRK M/ 41 inside a CV 90 chassis mock-up and firing grenades in several scenarios which would test the different parameters; elevation, charge, direction, BAD, angle of roof hatches, open/closed rear door and elevated chassis. The test showed that double ear protectors will be needed in the vehicle and with the potential that it will suffice with single ear protectors for personnel furthest in the vehicle. It is most likely that it will be restrictions on number of permissible rounds fired per day of 30 - 50 firings for charge 9, 40 - 50 with charge 7 and 70 - 80 with charge 5. The use of BAD resulted in the sound level decreasing between 5 - 12 dB which would increase the restrictions to a maximum of 100 rounds per day for maximum charge...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Media {{has since}} {{a long time}} back been writing about {{extensive}} thievery of recreational boats and their engines. The value of the stolen goods is estimated to several hundreds of million Swedish crowns per year. The widespread stealing creates a secondary market where boats sometimes are sold by sellers {{that do not have}} the rights to sell the boat. This creates risk for the buyer who most often is a private person. A situation the buyer can face is that the boat was stolen and that the original owner can demand to get the boat or engine back. The original owner has the right to get the boat back independently of if the purchase was done in good faith or not. Another risk is that the buyer purchases a boat that stands as security for a loan, so called reservation of title, which is common for expensive recreational boats. If the boat is sold in such a situation the buyer stands the risk of being forced to return the boat or be forced to pay the remaining debt. It is possible to try to claim the damage from the seller however they are normally difficult to get hold of or do not have the ability to payback any money.   It is complicated for private persons to understand what requirements that need to be fulfilled to make a good faith purchase of a recreational boat. A reliable register is also lacking for recreational boats, this in combination with the fact that guiding case law is limited creates a difficult situation. The objective of the essay is to clarify what is required to make a good faith purchase according to the law of “Godtrosförvärv av lösöre (1986 : 796, GFL) ” and case law. The essay aims to be of practical use for the purchaser of a recreational boat to minimize the risks of the purchase. It contains a checklist with important bullet points and a standard contract to be used at the time of purchase. It also contains illustrations of how real and fake engine and <b>chassi</b> numbers can look like. The wronged buyer will also have practical use of the essay since it contains information about what legal actions the buyer can take if he ends up losing the recreational boat, both from a private person and a business owner.   It is made clear in the essay that the change in the law that occurred 1999 regarding the demands to make a good faith purchase increased the demands on the buyer. This at least in theory puts the original owner in a better position. The question has not been thoroughly investigated since guiding court rulings regarding recreational boats, especially from Supreme Court of Sweden is lacking. Of the case law that does exist is it however clear that the investigation duty of the private buyer at the time of purchase is extensive. The fact that a reliable register is lacking could paradoxically point for and against the buyer being in good faith. A register had reduced the insecurity of the purchase since {{it would be possible to}} get information about the true owner. On the other hand it would be impossible to make a good faith purchase for those that did not check the register before the purchase. The essay discusses both advantages and disadvantages of compulsory registration of recreational boats.   The essay also covers the consequences the change in the law in 2003 regarding the ability to make good faith purchases of stolen goods. Case law shows that the ability to acquire stolen property in good faith exists, but is heavily limited and court rulings regarding recreational boats are non-existing.     The conclusion of the essay is that several factors determine if the buyer is in good faith or not. Several concrete and often occurring parameters including the price of the goods, the state of the goods and the sales situation are analyzed. All of the factors points towards the conclusion of highly limited possibilities to make good faith purchases of a recreational boat. The buyer should therefore take the investigation duty with great seriousness, take direction in the checklist provided and overall be skeptical and realistic in the purchasing situation. By doing so the risk of buying a boat that the seller does not have the right to sell is minimized...|$|E

However, monoterpene exploitation as industrially-relevant molecules is often limited because of their intricate properties (e. g. high hydrophobicity and structural instability). Biocatalysis may overcome such drawbacks, resorting to specialized enzymatic machinery. Therefore, {{it is not surprising}} that microbial communities have been prospected for monoterpene-catabolizing strains, to efficiently transform these oily compounds. Pseudomonas sp. M 1, isolated in 1999 from sediments of the Rhine river (Netherlands), was known to use the monoterpenes β-myrcene and β-citronellol as sole carbon sources, thus, harboring great potential as a cellular chassis and source of novel biomolecules. However, the full exploitation of M 1 enzymatic repertoire required detailed information on its molecular catalogue. This PhD thesis aimed at the characterization of the β-myrcene-related molecular repertoire of Pseudomonas sp. M 1, using a holistic experimental approach. Ultimately, this work envisaged to set the knowledge-base for the development of M 1 -based cell factories à la carte, towards the biotransformation of β-myrcene and related plant-derived volatiles. The genome of M 1 strain was sequenced by different high-throughput sequencing platforms and reconstructed using a customized pipeline to achieve a robust genome draft. The resulting 7 Mb assembled genome (comprised in a single scaffold) was the foundation for following functional genomics approaches, aiming the characterization of the full set of β-myrcene-related genes. A RNA-seq using β-myrcene-grown M 1 cells allowed the assessment of the β-myrcene stimulon and suggested an extensive molecular reprogramming, involving mechanisms of cell adaption to β-myrcene hydrophobicity and catabolism. Significantly, genes evidencing the highest β-myrcene-dependent expression level were located in a novel 28 -kb genomic island (GI). In general, the genes included in the 28 -kb GI shared low homology levels with sequences available in public databases. In silico analysis suggested that the 28 -kb GI seems to be organized in 8 transcriptional units (TU), whose products are putatively involved in i) β-myrcene sensing, ii) β-myrcene oxidation and bioconversion of β-myrcene derivatives into the central metabolism intermediates, and iii) regulation of gene expression. Experimental validation of in silico predictions for the 28 -kb GI was achieved by: i) constructing knock-out variants of the M 1; ii) fusing the predicted promoter regions with reporter genes (gfp and lacZ); iii) evaluating β-myrcene-dependent promoter activity in the different genetic backgrounds (M 1 and derived strains). Notably, a novel β-myrcene hydroxylase, responsible for the first oxidation of the β-myrcene backbone, was identified, as well as an essential sensor-like regulatory protein, whose inactivation abolished the ability of M 1 cells to grow in β-myrcene. Moreover, the TUs present in the 28 -kb GI were also differentially induced by other monoterpenes (e. g. linalyl acetate, limonene and β-pinene). Thus, the enzymatic repertoire of M 1, showed a broader catabolic spectrum towards acyclic and cyclic monoterpene-backbones, extending the potential of M 1 -based catalysts. GC-MS identification of the metabolites produced by M 1 and derived strains during β-myrcene biotransformation supported the performed genetic characterization and provided new hints on the versatility of M 1 enzymatic machinery. Remarkably, the different M 1 genotypes yielded different metabolite catalogues, which included several compounds with potential organoleptic/therapeutic properties (e. g. myrcen- 8 -ol, 4 -methyl- 3 -hexenoic acid, carvone). The apparent uniqueness of the β-myrcene-associated genetic code prompted a bioprospection of the myr+ trait in the environment, to understand its evolutionary track. Soil samples, collected from 2 pristine locations in Peneda-Gerês National Park (Portugal), were enriched with different carbon sources (glucose, pyruvate or β-myrcene) and the evolution of the microbial communities monitored by 16 S rRNA-based metagenomics. Exposure of the two microbiomes to β-myrcene led to a similar bacterial profile, mainly enriched in monoterpenedegraders species, some of which also reported elsewhere (e. g. Pseudomonas citronellolis and Rhodococcus erythropolis). Forty-one β-myrcene-catabolizing strains were isolated, from which ten (2 Achromobacter, 1 Cupriavidus, 1 Delftia, 4 Pseudomonas, 1 Sphingobacterium and 1 Variovorax strains) were selected for whole-genome sequencing and compared to M 1 strain. A clear genetic code associated with β-myrcene catabolism was not identified in the non-Pseudomonas isolates, suggesting the existence of alternative β-myrcene catabolic pathways in those isolates, to be exploited as source of novel catalysts. Strikingly, the 4 Pseudomonas isolates (2 related to M 1 strain and 2 related to P. protegens) harbored the full 28 -kb GI, even though they were isolated from distinct geographic locations, almost 20 years apart with respect to M 1. Comparative genomics showed that the 28 -kb GI is, included in a 78 -kb integrative element (ICE-like), inserted downstream a guaA gene and fully conserved in M 1 and the 4 soil Pseudomonas isolates. Therefore, this 78 -kb ICE appears to be the vehicle for the environmental dissemination of the β-myrcene trait, at least, among Pseudomonas. This work was the first holistic characterization of the β-myrcene catabolic pathway in a bacterial strain, providing an unprecedented biological knowledge that will be the cornerstone for following metabolic engineering strategy with synthetic biology platforms. Moreover, understanding the stability of the self-transmissible 78 -kb catabolic ICE and its overall regulatory mechanisms, as well as its host range will provide insights about its evolutionary track and improve engineering strategies to optimize the performance of M 1 -based chassis. Alguns monoterpenos (ex: β-mirceno), apresentam um grande potencial como precursores industriais devido às suas propriedades organolépticas e medicinais. Contudo, as suas características físico-químicas (alta hidrofobicidade e instabilidade estrutural) dificultam a sua transformação em produtos comercialmente relevantes. A biocatálise apresenta-se como uma estratégia aliciante através da utilização de sistemas enzimáticos especializados. Como tal, tem sido frequente, a bioprospecção de microrganismos capazes de catabolizar monoterpenos, para explorar o seu repertório enzimático em processos biotecnológicos. Em 1999, a estirpe Pseudomonas sp. M 1 foi isolada de sedimentos do rio Reno (Holanda), sendo capaz de mineralizar β-mirceno e β-citronelol como fontes únicas de carbono. Deste modo, a estirpe M 1 apresenta potencial para ser um <b>chassi</b> biológico e uma fonte de novas moléculas com relevância biotecnológica. No entanto, o estudo e exploração da sua maquinaria enzimática requerem um conhecimento detalhado sobre o seu catálogo de genes e proteínas. Este projecto de doutoramento teve como finalidade a caracterização da estirpe Pseudomonas sp. M 1 através de abordagens de biologia de sistemas, permitindo integrar conhecimento dos seus mecanismos moleculares e fisiologia, para desenvolver fábricas celulares especializadas na biotransformação de monoterpenos, em especial, de β-mirceno. O genoma da estirpe M 1 foi sequenciado por tecnologias de alto débito e reconstruido utilizando diversas ferramentas bioinformáticas, num único scaffold genómico com cerca de 7 Mb, que serviu de base para as abordagens seguintes de caracterização funcional. O transcriptoma de células da estirpe M 1, crescidas na presença de β-mirceno foi analisado por RNA-seq, com a finalidade de descrever os genes envolvidos no catabolismo do β-mirceno. Esta abordagem sugeriu uma extensa reprogramação metabólica da estirpe M 1, envolvendo mecanismos de adaptação à hidrofobicidade do β-mirceno e do seu catabolismo. Em particular, os genes que registaram maiores níveis de expressão foram localizados numa nova ilha genómica (GI) de 28 -kb. A GI aparenta estar organizada em 8 unidade transcricionais (UT), putativamente envolvidas i) na deteção do β- mirceno, ii) na sua biotransformação, e iii) na regulação da via catabólica. A análise in silico da GI foi validada experimentalmente pelo i) knock-out de alguns dos seus genes e ii) fusão das suas regiões promotoras com os genes repórter gfp e lacZ, avaliando a atividade promotora β-mirceno-dependente associada às 8 UTs na estirpe M 1 e mutantes construídos. Em particular, uma nova hidroxilase, responsável pela oxidação inicial β-mirceno, foi identificada, assim como uma nova proteína reguladora essencial para a activação de toda a GI e capacidade da estirpe M 1 catabolizar β-mirceno. As UTs da GI foram também diferencialmente induzidas por outros monoterpenos (ex. linalool, limoneno e β-pineno), estendendo assim o potencial catabólico da GI para um largo espectro de monoterpenos de estrutura acíclica e cíclica. A identificação dos metabolitos produzidos durante a biotransformação do β-mirceno na estirpe M 1 e nos 4 mutantes, usando GC-MS, validou a caracterização genética da GI, assim como a versatilidade metabólica da estirpe M 1 na produção de diversos compostos com possíveis propriedades organolépticas/terapêuticas (ex: mircenol, ácido 4 -metil- 3 -hexenoico e carvona). O carácter único do código genético do catabolismo do β-mirceno motivou a sua prospecção no ambiente, para compreender a sua evolução. Amostras de solo de 2 locais distintos no Parque Nacional da Peneda-Gerês (Portugal) foram cultivadas em laboratório com diferentes fontes de carbono (glucose, piruvato ou β-mirceno), e a respetiva evolução bacteriana monitorizada por metagenómica direcionada ao gene 16 S rRNA. Na presença de β-mirceno, os microbiomas de ambos os solos evoluíram para um perfil semelhante, sendo constituído maioritariamente por estirpes catabolizadoras de monoterpenos, algumas das quais já conhecidas (ex: P. citronellolis e R. erythropolis). Foram isoladas quarenta e uma bactérias catabolizadoras de β-mirceno, das quais 10 bactérias, pertencentes aos géneros Achromobacter (2), Cupriavidus (1), Delftia (1), Pseudomonas (4), Sphingobacterium (1) e Variovorax (1), foram sequenciadas e seu genoma comparado com o da estirpe M 1. O genoma de Achromobacter, Cupriavidus, Delftia, Sphingobacterium e Variovorax não apresentou homólogos significativos à GI da estirpe M 1, pelo que a identificação do seu código catabólico para β-mirceno requererá abordagens funcionais. Pelo contrário, o genoma das 4 estirpes de Pseudomonas (2 semelhantes à estirpe M 1 e 2 semelhantes a estirpes de P. protegens) inclui a GI associada ao catabolismo do β-mirceno na estirpe M 1. A comparação detalhada destes genomas com o genoma de M 1 sugeriu que, efetivamente, a GI se encontra incluída num segmento altamente conservado de 78 -kb, que se assemelha a um elemento integrativo (ICE), inserido a jusante do gene guaA nos 5 genomas. A conservação do ICE nas 5 estirpes sugere que este elemento integrativo deverá ser o vetor de transmissão do código genético para o catabolismo de β-mirceno, pelo menos em Pseudomonas. O trabalho apresentado nesta tese é a primeira descrição holística do catabolismo de β-mirceno em bactérias, disponibilizando informação biológica e conhecimento essencial, que servirá de base para planear futuras estratégias de engenharia metabólica, usando ferramentas de biologia sintética. O trabalho desenvolvido forneceu também pistas sobre i) a evolução do código genético para o catabolismo de β-mirceno da estirpe M 1, cuja compreensão relativamente à sua estabilidade e regulação poderá fornecer pistas importante para a sua otimização, e sobre ii) a existência de vias catabólicas alternativas, que deverão certamente conter novas enzimas, abrindo novas possibilidades de transformar o β-mirceno numa gama de diferentes compostos.
