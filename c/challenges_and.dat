40|$|Purpose of Study: Several {{studies have}} {{examined}} <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat via specific cardiovascular parameters in relation to sporting performance. However, limited evidence exists that utilises self-report measures of <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat and the impact upon sport performance. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine self-report of <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat and its association with shooting performance. Methodology: One hundred and two participants (Mean age= 26. 82, SD= 10. 01) were recruited for the study. A quasi-experimental study was implemented to explore the association between self-report measures of <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat and its relationship with shooting performance. Cardiovascular (CV) parameters recorded during the experiment included cardiac output and total peripheral resistance due to their association with <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat. Results: There was a significant proportion of variance accounted for by <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> shooting performance (R²=. 42, p< 0. 05). As challenge report increased, shooting performance decreased (ß=-. 204, p< 0. 05). Moreover, when <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat patterns were examined, the analysis indicated that moderate challenge/low threat had a more facilitative performance in the shooting task (Mean= 7. 96, SD= 1. 49) compared to all of the other combinations of <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat patterns. In regard to CV measures, there was no significant associations observed between <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat or shooting performance (p< 0. 05). Discussion and Conclusion: Higher levels of challenge are not ideal when completing a discrete motor skill task, such as shooting. These findings appear to suggest that a combination of moderate <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> low threat may elicit a facilitative performance in regards to a discrete motor skill...|$|R
40|$|Introduction There is some {{contention}} {{within the}} existing literature examining <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat in a sport context. It is suggested that <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat can be experienced simultaneously (Cerin, 2003; Meijen et al, 2013); however this has been seldom examined. Based upon the suggestions of The Theory of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat in Athletes model (TCTSA; Jones et al, 2009) <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat result in differing sport performance and have an impact upon emotions experienced. <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat self-report was examined alongside shooting performance and emotions. Methodology One hundred and two participants (mean age= 26. 82, SD= 10. 01) were recruited for the study. A quasi-experimental study was implemented. Self-report of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat were collected alongside emotions via the Sport Emotion Questionnaire (Jones et al, 2005) with reference to a shooting task. Results There was {{a significant proportion of}} variance accounted for by <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> shooting performance (R²=. 42, p< 0. 05). As Challenge report increased, shooting performance decreased (ß=-. 204, p< 0. 05). Moreover, when <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat patterns were examined, the analysis indicated that moderate Challenge/low Threat had a more facilitative performance in the shooting task (Mean= 7. 96, SD= 1. 49) compared to all of the other combinations of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat patterns. In regards to emotion moderate Challenge/low Threat reported lower amounts of happiness (mean= 1. 32, SD=. 88) and excitement (mean 1. 42, SD= 68) and moderate Challenge/moderate Threat reported more anxiety (mean= 2. 05, SD=. 69) than all of the other group combinations. Conclusion The study support suggestions that patterns of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat can have an impact upon performance, moreover emotions also differ between different patterns of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat. Future research should examine patterns of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat and the potential impact this has upon central tenants of the TCTSA model for example control. This study has implications for application to the applied field as the influence of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat has been shown to have an impact upon sporting performance...|$|R

40|$|The aims of this {{research}} programme were to a. Further examine and develop an existing self-report measure of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat within a sport context, b. Examine <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat self-report with performance in a sport context, c. Further examine the Biopsychosocial Model (BPSM) proposed in relation to <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat and sport performance, d. Examine the associations between Challenge, Threat, cortisol response and sport performance, e. Examine self-report of emotions direction and intensity experienced during a sport performance in regard to <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat <b>and</b> f. Examine <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat in combination {{with each other in}} regard to sport performance. These 6 aims were addressed in 3 different empirical studies. Study 1 used a cross sectional study design to explore the validity and reliability of an existing self-report measure of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat. Participants were gym users (n= 200, Mage= 24. 91) and asked to complete the self-report measure before a dart-throwing competition. Study 2 comprised of three different stages. Stage 1; a cross sectional study design to examine the content validity of a pool of existing self-report items to measure <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat in a range of athletes (n= 25, Mage= 22. 00). Participants comprised of male and female athletes engaged in various sports (football, n= 6, cricket, n= 2, swimming, n= 5, tennis, n= 1, rugby, n= 6, netball, n= 3, basketball, n= 2.). Stage 2, used a cross sectional study design to further examine the construct validity of the remaining items from stage 1. This stage used principle components analysis (PCA) to determine whether <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat self-report items were grouped in a particular way (Kline, 1994). Participants were competitive runners (n= 197, Mage= 37. 11) and asked to complete the self-report measure regarding <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat before competition. Stage 3 used a cross sectional study design to explore the validity and reliability of the self-report measure of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat developed in stages 1 - 2 in competitive runners (n= 147, Mage = 30. 06), using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine how well the data total fitted the proposed hypothetical model. Finally a quasi-experimental study (study 3) examined the association between <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat and shooting performance. This study explored the <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat self-report measure and its relationship with performance, emotions and physiological responses. Participants in this study comprised of university student and staff members (n= 102, Mage = 27. 11). Results from study 1 suggested that the existing self-report measure of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat utilised was not suitable for use within a sport context. Results from study 2, stage 1, revealed a pool of self-report items that athletes described as applicable and relevant to their sports performance. Results from study 2, stage 2, suggested that items identified in study 2, stage 1 represented a two component solution, one associated with Threat <b>and</b> the other <b>Challenge.</b> Results from study 2, stage 3 suggested that a 12 item self-report measure was suitable for use within a sport context <b>and</b> that <b>Challenge</b> has a positive association with sport performance. Finally, study 3, suggested that the self-report measure of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat developed in study 2 (stages 1 - 3) was suitable for use within a sport context. Results from study 3 also suggest that a mixture of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat can have implications for performance outcome. Emotions reported were shown to have associations with <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat self-report, as suggested by The Theory of <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat States in Athletes (TCTSA). The study findings showed that physiological associations with <b>Challenge</b> <b>and</b> Threat were equivocal. Limitations to the present research programme and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Objectives This study {{examined}} the relationship between the cognitive and affective components of the theory of <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat states in athletes (TCTSA). It was expected that cognitive components, specifically self-efficacy, perceived control, and achievement goals, predict <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat appraisals and emotional states, as well as the interpretation of emotional state. Design A cross-sectional design was employed to measure self-efficacy, perceived control, achievement goals, emotional state, interpretation of emotional state, <b>and</b> <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat cognitive appraisal in relation to how participants typically approach an important competition. Method 177 collegiate athletes completed questionnaires measuring the cognitive and affective components of <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat states. Results A regression analysis was performed to examine if cognitive elements predicted <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat appraisals and emotions. Threat appraisal was predicted by avoidance goals and emotions were predicted by cognitive components. There was a negative association between anxiety and self-efficacy and a positive association between anxiety and avoidance goals. Also, differences between <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> threat appraisal patterns (high challenge/high threat, high challenge/low threat, low challenge/high threat, low challenge/low threat) were analysed. Participants with a high <b>challenge</b> <b>and</b> low threat appraisals pattern scored higher on self-efficacy and lower on avoidance goals and anxiety than other challenge/threat patterns. Conclusions The results provide support for the TCTSA. What athletes think, based on their cognitive components, influences the emotions they experience, and their approaches to competition...|$|R
