5|$|The Iraqi {{military}} quickly proved {{no match}} for coalition military power, and with their defeat the bulk of Australian forces were withdrawn. While Australia did not initially {{take part in the}} post-war occupation of Iraq, an Australian Army light armoured battlegroup—designated the Al Muthanna Task Group and including 40 ASLAV light armoured vehicles and infantry—was later deployed to Southern Iraq in April 2005 as part of Operation Catalyst. The role of this force was to protect the Japanese engineer contingent in the region and support the training of New Iraqi Army units. The AMTG later became the Overwatch Battle Group (West) (OBG(W)), following the hand back of Al Muthanna province to Iraqi <b>control.</b> <b>Force</b> levels peaked at 1,400 personnel in May 2007 including the OBG(W) in Southern Iraq, the Security Detachment in Baghdad and the Australian Army Training Team—Iraq. A RAN frigate was based in the North Persian Gulf, while RAAF assets included C-130H Hercules and AP-3C elements. Following the election of a new Labor government under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd the bulk of these forces were withdrawn by mid-2009, while RAAF and RAN operations were redirected {{to other parts of the}} Middle East Area of Operations as part of Operation Slipper.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{develops}} the control discretization and control optimization processes for the uniform damping of structures. A distributed uniform damping control is first shown {{to represent a}} first-order approximation to an associated globally optimal solution. This approximation is shown to be accurate for moderate to low levels of damping. The implementation of uniform damping control with discrete <b>control</b> <b>forces</b> is then demonstrated, using a subdomain approach, whereby a transformation of coordinates is carried out and a resulting subdomain polynomial expansion is truncated. Control laws are developed for one, two, and three discrete <b>control</b> <b>forces</b> per subdomain. Next, a steepest descent method is developed for the optimal assignment of control gains and {{the locations of the}} <b>control</b> <b>forces.</b> As a general rule the number of modes that can be uniformly damped is twice the number of <b>control</b> <b>forces.</b> The <b>control</b> discretization and associated optimization processes are illustrated via the control of a cantilever beam...|$|R

25|$|On December 17, 1927, the United States Coast Guard {{destroyer}} Paulding accidentally rammed {{and sank}} the <b>Control</b> <b>Force</b> submarine S-4 off Provincetown, Massachusetts. Brumby {{took charge of}} the rescue effort, assisted by Captain Ernest J. King, who had recently commanded the salvage operation for the sunken submarine S-51. As the weather worsened, the submarine tender Falcon attempted to attach air hoses to the sunken submarine to force it to the surface by filling its ballast tanks, or at least supply air to the six surviving crewmen, but to no avail. Finally, Brumby had to order Falcon into Provincetown Harbor to ride out the winter storm, which lasted days. The trapped crewmen died of suffocation.|$|E
500|$|Generally {{one wants}} to have the wing's centre of {{pressure}} (CP, or [...] "lift point") close to the aircraft's centre of gravity (CG, or [...] "balance point") {{to reduce the amount}} of <b>control</b> <b>force</b> required to pitch the aircraft. As the aircraft layout changes during the design phase, it is common for the CG to move fore or aft. With a normal wing design this can be addressed by moving the wing slightly fore or aft to account for this. With a delta wing running most of the length of the fuselage, this was no longer easy; moving the wing would leave it in front of the nose or behind the tail. Studying the various layouts in terms of CG changes, both during design and changes due to fuel use during flight, the ogee planform immediately came to the fore.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{laminated}} polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) actuator is analyzed when partially covering a paraboloidal shell. Models of <b>control</b> <b>forces</b> are established using the thin flexible shell theory and the membrane approximation. Analytical expressions of actuating forces and moments are derived and a parametric study is conducted to evaluate {{the effects of the}} physical properties of the actuator on the <b>control</b> <b>forces.</b> To verify the model, experiments were carried out on actuation and open-loop vibration control of a paraboloidal antenna with a much smaller actuator. The experimental results agree well with those obtained analytically. The results indicate the following: The laminated PVDF actuator (LPA) can provide effective <b>control</b> <b>forces</b> with low voltages. The <b>control</b> <b>forces</b> consist of actuating forces and moments, but the effect of the normal actuation force distribution is much greater than that of the actuation moments in controlling the normal vibration. The larger the curvature radius of the paraboliodal shell, the smaller the magnitudes of the required actuating forces. The magnitudes of actuating forces are approximately linear with the number of PVDF layers. <br/...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the major conclusions of {{twenty years of}} research in robot <b>force</b> <b>control,</b> points out remaining problems, and introduces issues that need more attention.

40|$|We {{present some}} discrete-time {{perspectives}} on the active vibration control of a simple acausal system subjected to deterministic but broadband excitation. Here, exact vibration cancellation is not possible with bounded <b>control</b> <b>forces.</b> However, on penalizing high <b>control</b> <b>forces</b> using a weighting factor, we obtain a one parameter family of finite-time optimal feedforward (FTOF) controllers that substantially reduce vibration levels through bounded <b>control</b> <b>forces.</b> These controllers require knowledge {{of the future of}} the forcing, and are thus acausal. However, only a finite amount of the future needs to be known for practical purposes. These future values are predicted using a neural network. The FTOF controllers perform better than a direct application of the standard LMS algorithm. An LMS algorithm which uses several future values of the forcing performs better still.

On the other hand, {{it is important to}} develop a test to estimate individ-ual’s measurements based on certain kinds of standards. However, because the measurements vary with age, it is difficult to make up a common standard for all age groups. In order to devise evaluation criteria for each age group, it is necessary to examine the age group differences of con-trolled force exertion values. According to Nagasawa et al.
