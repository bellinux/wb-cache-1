40|$|SUMMARY: In {{fault-tolerant}} multiprocessor systems, different non-faulty processes may {{arrive at}} different values {{for a given}} system parameter. To resolve this disagreement, processes must exchange and vote upon their respective local values. During voting, faulty processes may attempt to inhibit agreement by acting in a malicious or “Byzantine ” manner. Approximate Agreement defines one form of agreement in which the voted values obtained by the non-faulty processes need not be identical. Rather, they need only agree to within a predefined tolerance. Approximate Agreement {{can be achieved by}} a sequence of convergent voting rounds, in which the range of values held by non-faulty processes is reduced in each round. Existing convergent voting algorithms assume <b>complete</b> <b>connectivity</b> between processes. Where the physical connectivity is incomplete, messages are relayed between processors to simulate <b>complete</b> <b>connectivity.</b> For large, sparsely connected systems, the message traffic associated with message relay could be prohibitive. This paper addresses convergent voting in partially connected systems where message relay is prohibited. Simple expressions are developed for the convergence rates and robustness of a broad family of “locally ” convergent voting algorithms, in the presence of two distinct fault modes. These expressions are then employed to determine the robustness of local convergence in some commonly used partially connected networks. Finally, issues affecting “global ” convergence are addressed and a methodology for analyzing global convergence properties is given...|$|E
