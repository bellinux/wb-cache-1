That data is augmented by 1 / 3 in the latest Catalogue. The binomial probabil-ity that the previously identified overpopulated region of the celestial sphere would continue to be overpopulated as much or more in the new data if the distribution were truly random is 0. 009. In addition, correlations between orbital elements that are characteristic of an impulse re-main statistically significant. The geometry of the over-populated band is inconsistent with a stellar impulse but may be compatible with a bound Jovian mass solar com-panion. Key words: <b>comets,</b> <b>dynamics...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper tackles {{important}} aspects of <b>comets</b> <b>dynamics</b> from a statistical point of view. Existing methodology uses numerical integration for computing planetary perturbations for simulating such dynamics. This operation is highly computational. It is reasonable to wonder whenever statistical simulation of the perturbations can be much more easy to handle. The first step for answering such a question {{is to provide a}} statistical study of these perturbations in order to catch their main features. The statistical tools used are order statistics and heavy tail distributions. The study carried out indicated a general pattern exhibited by the perturbations around the orbits of the important planet. These characteristics were validated through statistical testing and a theoretical study based on Opik theory.

40|$|This {{text was}} {{originally}} written to accompany {{a series of}} lectures that I gave at the ` 35 th Saas-Fee advanced course' in Switzerland and at the Institute for Astronomy of the University of Hawaii. It reviews my current understanding {{of the dynamics of}} comets and of the origin and primordial sculpting of their reservoirs. It starts discussing the structure of the Kuiper belt and the current dynamics of Kuiper belt objects, including scattered disk objects. Then it discusses the dynamical evolution of Jupiter family comets from the trans-Neptunian region, and of long period comets from the Oort cloud. The formation of the Oort cloud is then reviewed, as well as the primordial sculpting of the Kuiper belt. Finally, these issues are revisited in the light of a new model of giant planets evolution that has been developed to explain the origin of the late heavy bombardment of the terrestrial planets.

40|$|A {{comet nucleus}} sample return mission {{in terms of}} its {{relevant}} science objectives, candidate mission concepts, key design/technology requirements, and programmatic issues is discussed. The primary objective was to collect a sample of undisturbed comet material from beneath the surface of an active comet and to preserve its chemical and, if possible, its physical integrity and return it to Earth in a minimally altered state. The secondary objectives are to: (1) characterize the comet to a level consistent with a rendezvous mission; (2) monitor the <b>comet</b> <b>dynamics</b> through perihelion and aphelion with a long lived lander; and (3) determine the subsurface properties of the nucleus in an area local to the sampled core. A set of candidate comets is discussed. The hazards which the spacecraft would encounter {{in the vicinity of the}} comet are also discussed. The encounter strategy, the sampling hardware, the thermal control of the pristine comet material during the return to Earth, and the flight performance of various spacecraft systems and the cost estimates of such a mission are presented...|$|R
40|$|The main {{features}} of 1 P/Halley chaotic dynamics {{can be described}} by a two dimensional symplectic map. Using Mel'nikov integral we semi-analytically determine such a map for 1 P/Halley taking into account gravitational interactions from the Sun and the eight planets. We determine the Solar system kick function ie the energy transfer to 1 P/Halley along one passage through the Solar system. Our procedure allows to compute for each planet its contribution to the Solar system kick function {{which appears to be}} the sum of the Keplerian potential of the planet and of a rotating circular gravitational dipole potential due to the Sun movement around Solar system barycenter. We test the robustness of the symplectic Halley map by directly integrating Newton's equations over ∼ 2. 4 · 10 ^ 4 yr around Y 2 K and by reconstructing the Solar system kick function. Our results show that the Halley map with fixed parameters gives a reliable description of <b>comet</b> <b>dynamics</b> on time scales of 10 ^ 4 yr while on a larger scales the parameters of the map are slowly changing due to slow oscillations of orbital momentum.

40|$|Asteroids and comets {{dissipate}} energy {{when they}} rotate {{about the axis}} different from the axis of the maximal moment of inertia. We show that the most efficient internal relaxation happens at the double frequency of body's tumbling. Therefore the earlier estimates that ignore double frequency input underestimate the internal relaxation in asteroids and comets. We show that the Earth seismological data may poorly represent acoustic properties of asteroids and comet as internal relaxation increases {{in the presence of}} moisture. At the same time owing to non-linearlity of inelastic relaxation small angle nutations can persist for very long time spans. Subject headings: <b>comets,</b> asteroids: <b>dynamics,</b> internal relaxation 1. Introduction Comet P/Halley exhibits very complex rotational motion (e. g.

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{results of a}} {{research}} program to explore {{the sensitivity of the}} orbits of Oort cloud comets to changes in the strength of the Galactic tides in the plane of the disk and also to changes in the mass of the host star. We performed 2 D simulations that confirm that the effects of the tides on comet orbits are sensitive to a star's distance from the Galactic center. A comet cloud closer to the Galactic center than the Sun will have comet perihelia reduced to the region of the inner planets more effectively by the planar tides alone. Similar results are found for a star of smaller mass. We also show how this phenomenon of comet injection persists for a set of alternative Galactic potential models. These preliminary results suggest a fruitful line of research, one that aims to generalize the study of <b>comet</b> cloud <b>dynamics</b> to systems different from the Solar System. In particular, it will allow us to study the roles played by comet clouds in defining the boundaries of the Galactic Habitable Zone.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the study of the coma and gas tail of Hailey's Comet. The thesis begins with a summary of the relevant background material. Theories of origin are discussed, after which the known properties of cometary comae, nuclei and tails are described. Narrow-band photometry of Hailey's Comet both pre- and post-perihelion is documented. The observations of the OH band at 3080 A are discussed first, as it is a product of H 2 O. Production rates and lifetimes against photodissociation are calculated using both the Haser Model and the Average Random Walk Model. The variation of production rates of CN, C 2 and C 3 are discussed in the light of current knowledge of Hailey's nucleus. Photodestruction lifetimes of these trace species are found using a Monte-Carlo modelling technique. The analysis of large-scale image of the plasma tail of Hailey is described, resulting in the determination of the solar wind velocity at the <b>comet.</b> The <b>dynamics</b> of the ions in the tail are demonstrated using a simple analytical approximation to the magnetic field structure. Observations of discrete plasma formations within the tail allow the measurement of the internal velocity field, from which an estimate of the tail magnetic field strength is derived...|$|R
40|$|Two {{long-lived}} {{peaks in}} extraterrestrial ^ 3 He flux {{have been identified}} in the sedimentary record of the Cenozoic Era: at 8. 2 Ma (late Miocene) and 35. 8 Ma (late Eocene). These peaks document the occurrence of important events in the recent history of the solar system. The timing and temporal evolution of the dust event in the late Miocene as well as the absence of major terrestrial impact craters are consistent with an origin in the catastrophic collision that produced the Veritas asteroid family at this time. In contrast, there is no known asteroid collision corresponding to the late Eocene peak. Instead, the late Eocene event has elements consistent with a comet shower produced by a close stellar encounter. Both the rise time and the fall time of the enhanced dust flux and the occurrence of two major terrestrial impacts {{at the peak of the}} event are predicted by considerations of <b>comet</b> shower <b>dynamics.</b> However, debris from one of these impacts has a Cr isotope ratio that appears to exclude a carbonaceous chondrite impactor. If the presumption that comets have a carbonaceous chondrite–like composition is accurate, then an alternative mechanism for the late Eocene event may be required. The recent suggestion of an asteroid shower, where the ^ 3 He-bearing dust resulted from lunar impacts, is one such possibility, but it too fails to account fully for existing observations. The cause of the late Eocene event thus remains uncertain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Reactive torques, due to {{anisotropic}} sublimation on a {{comet nucleus}} surface, produce slow variations of its rotation. In this paper the secular {{effects of this}} sublimation are studied. The general rotational equations of motion are averaged over unperturbed fast rotation around the mass center (Euler-Poinsot motion) and over the orbital comet motion. We discuss the parameters that define typical properties of the rotational evolution and discover different classifications of the rotational evolution. As an example we discuss some possible scenarios of rotational evolution for the nuclei of the comets Halley and Borrelly. Key words: <b>comet</b> nucleus, rotational <b>dynamics,</b> non-gravitational perturbations 1. Statement of the Problem and Main Assumptions In the classical model of a comet nucleus proposed by Whipple (1951), anisotropic ice sublimation due to solar radiation produces reactive torques, M r,that act on the nucleus. The goal of the present paper is to study the possible secular effects produced by M r on the rotational dynamics of the nucleus. Unlike previous studies, based primarily on numerical modeling of nucleus rotation evolution (Wilhelm, 1987; Peale and Lissauer, 1989; Julian, 1990; Samarasinha and Belton...|$|R
40|$|An {{outgassing}} jet {{model is}} presented in support of spacecraft navigation for future missions to comets. The outgassing jet is modelled as an emission cone while the comet nucleus is modelled as a uniform density triaxial ellipsoid. The heliocentric orbit motion {{as well as in}} the strength of the outgassing jet are accounted for in the equations of motion. This model can predict the rotational evolution of a comet nucleus as a result the outgassing jets' reactive torques as well as for simulation of an orbiting spacecraft's trajectory through jet passages and the estimation of the physical outgassing properties of jets from perturbations to the spacecraft's motion. A rotational evolution model of a comet nucleus is presented and predicts possible levels of rotational excitation for a comet nucleus under torques produced by multiple discrete outgassing jets located on the surface. An analytical theory for the secular solution to the rotational motion of comets with an axis of symmetry is derived and used to predict rotational state changes over multiple perihelion passages. A method of characterizing the <b>comet</b> nucleus <b>dynamics</b> to predict the end state of the rotation is found from the averaged equations. Applications of these analytical results to predict the stochastic evolution of a comet nucleus rotation are outlined. This thesis also identifies and analyzes stable Sun synchronous orbits in a Hill rotating frame which can be applied to any small body in the solar system. The stability of these orbits is due to the inclusion of solar radiation pressure effects. The stability of the orbits in terms of escaping the comet is analyzed though construction of zero-velocity curves and the use of spectral analysis. The effect of orbital perturbations from outgassing jets on the stability criterion are also considered in the stability analysis of a spacecraft in orbit about a comet. Once these orbits have been identified, the effects of a non-spherical body are explored. Impulsive and finite burn control schemes to restrict a stable orbit's motion are determined, showing that it is feasible to implement a form of orbital hovering in the terminator plane of a comet...|$|R
40|$|The complex {{dynamics}} of 67 P has the typical uncertainties of the Jupiter-family comets. The Rosetta mission provided {{a unique opportunity}} to dissipate them with fresh experimental data. We aim to constrain the residence time of the <b>comet</b> in a <b>dynamics</b> dominated by Jupiter and Saturn by comparing statistics of large sets of numerical integrations with assumptions on the erosion experienced by the comet. We integrated backward for 150 kyr 2000 clones of 67 P selected from preliminary integrations of 500 000 clones. We find that the clones that did not arrive from hyperbolic/parabolic orbits have been mostly in the region dominated by Jupiter and Saturn in the last 150 kyr; they transit easily between dynamics dominated by Jupiter, dynamics also dominated by Saturn and, with smaller probability, by Saturn alone. Many clones were injected in the Jupiter family from hyperbolic orbits and orbits of large periods P > 500 yr, but none of the clones was injected from a Uranus-dominated dynamics through sequences of planetary scatterings, while 5 per cent of the clones were injected on this route in 500 kyr. 60 per cent of the clones had already been in an orbit with q < 1. 5 au before 1959. Compatible with the uncertainties on the long-term model of non-gravitational forces, we conclude that 67 P was injected from a cometary reservoir into a dynamics dominated by Jupiter and Saturn at an epoch that we estimate as being in between 30 and 150 kyr ago; this interval should be extended by considering periods of dormancies...|$|R
