5|$|Following {{two decades}} of uneasy peace, Britain and France {{declared}} war against one another in 1689. Despite the 1669 Treaty of Whitehall, in which European forces agreed that Continental conflicts would not disrupt colonial peace and neutrality, the war was fought primarily by proxy in New France and New England. The British of New York prompted local Iroquois warriors to attack New France's undefended settlements. While the British were preparing to engage in acts of warfare, the inhabitants of New France were ill-prepared to defend against the Indian attacks” due to {{the isolation of the}} farms and villages. Denonville was quoted as saying “If we have a war, nothing <b>can</b> <b>save</b> <b>the</b> country but a miracle of God,”.|$|E
5|$|Lewis and Audrey {{decide to}} go on holiday {{together}} and Lewis offers to pay for himself. Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly wrote that Lewis' renewed relationship with Audrey and their plans {{to go on a}} round-the-world cruise would cause a feud between her and David. Audrey's money is tied up in the salon, so she asks David to sign it back to her so she can pay for the holiday. However, David refuses to sign the salon back as he thinks Lewis might be planning another fraud. Kilkelly said Lewis tries to play peacemaker and suggests postponing the trip until he <b>can</b> <b>save</b> <b>the</b> money himself, but Audrey insists David will co-operate and she tears up their contract.|$|E
5|$|Mother 3 is a single-player {{role playing}} video game similar to {{previous}} {{games in the}} Mother series. The player controls a party of playable characters who explore the game's two-dimensional fictional world, primarily shown from a top-down perspective. While navigating the overworld, the player may converse with non-player characters, obtain items, or encounter enemies. Winning battles against enemies awards experience points to the party, which is required for leveling up. Leveling up a character permanently enhances its individual attributes such as maximum hit points (HP), power points (PP), offense, and defense. Weapons, armor, or accessories can be equipped on a character to increase certain attributes. The player can restore their characters' HP and PP or heal various status ailments by visiting hot springs which are placed abundantly in the game world, and the player <b>can</b> <b>save</b> <b>the</b> game by talking to frogs. Currency is introduced in the later half of the game as Dragon Points (DP), earned by winning battles and used to purchase items. The player can deposit or withdraw DP from frogs.|$|E

5|$|E.T. is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control an alien (E.T.) from a top-down perspective. The objective {{of the game is}} to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). The player is provided with an on-screen energy bar, which decreases when E.T. performs any actions (including moving, teleporting, or falling into a pit, as well as levitating back to the top). To prevent this, E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces, which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece of the telephone, or the player <b>can</b> <b>save</b> <b>the</b> candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone, which allows him to call his home planet. When the call is made, E.T. must reach the spaceship in a given time limit. Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on screen and take him back to his home planet. Then the game starts over, with the same difficulty level, while changing the location of the telephone pieces. The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration. The game ends when the energy bar depletes. E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliot will come in and revive him. E.T. can get a fourth life if the player is lucky enough to find a geranium in one of the wells. It turns into a sprite from some games that Howard Scott Warshaw made, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E

25|$|Raiden {{appears in}} the latest installment, Mortal Kombat X. During the Neatherrealm war Raiden and Fujin team up to take down a horde of demons and {{come face to face}} with some of the Defenders Raiden lost in the {{previous}} game that are now under Quan Chi's control. They manage to defeat Shinnok and lock him in an amulet thanks to Johnny Cage's unlocked power. During a confrontation with Quan Chi in his fortress, he is not only able to resurrect a mortally wounded Johnny with Sonya's help, but he is also able to resurrect Jax, Scorpion, and Sub-Zero by combining his magic with his, giving him hope that he <b>can</b> <b>save</b> <b>the</b> other fallen Earthrealm warriors. Years later he catches Kung Lao's cousin Kung Jin stealing a statue from his temple given to him from Jin's family. Raiden allows Jin to beat him in a fight to release his anger on Raiden for his involvement in Kung Lao's death, and encourages the young warrior to join the Shaolin Monks. Another couple of years later, Raiden finds that Shinnok's amulet has been stolen, and he and the new Earthrealm Defenders work to stop Shinnok from being freed. After conversing with Bo' Rai Cho over his regret of losing Liu Kang and Kung Lao and reminiscing an older mission, he is attacked by Shinnok and his corrupted former allies. The revenants badly injure Raiden allowing Shinnok to hold him prisoner and take over the Jinsei Chamber. Shinnok is later stopped by Johnny's daughter Cassie. After which, Raiden requests Kung Jin and Cassie to put him in the Jinsei Chamber, where he purifies it while drawing energy from Shinnok. In the epilogue, Raiden now appears in a darker form similar to his appearance in Deception and Armageddon and warns the new Neatherrealm rulers, Liu Kang and Kitana, that he will show no mercy to anyone who threatens Earthrealm, and gives them Shinnok's decapitated but still living head to prove his point.|$|E
500|$|... "Tears Run Dry" [...] was {{originally}} an instrumental by Crada {{and later on}} strings were added. The song is a 'venting' record, where Tinie shares personal thoughts and then turns into a heavier finale. According to Tinie it was amended about 37 times due to constant adjustments and improvements. [...] "Lost Ones" [...] is about a couple splitting up but trying to maintain their pride, and then realising that in reality they do regret it. Paloma Faith recorded an [...] "eerie" [...] vocal for the chorus. Apparently Tinie wanted {{a part of the}} album to be motivational, and conveys this with the songs [...] "Children of the Sun", [...] "A Heart <b>Can</b> <b>Save</b> <b>the</b> World" [...] and [...] "Heroes". Emeli Sandé features on [...] "A Heart <b>Can</b> <b>Save</b> <b>the</b> World", and also wrote Laura Mvula's chorus for [...] "Heroes". Sandé also appeared on the Disc-Overy track [...] "Let Go". All three tracks are produced by Naughty Boy, a frequent collaborator with Sandé.|$|E

500|$|In 2000, {{a version}} of Donkey Kong Country was {{released}} for the Game Boy Color. [...] The GBC version has a new stage in Chimp Caverns called [...] "Necky Nutmare", {{as well as a}} revamped and longer Winky's Walkway. The GBC version had some of the music scrapped and replaced, often with music that had originated in Donkey Kong Land. In 2003, another version of the game was released for the Game Boy Advance. This version has increased brightness, at the cost of contrast and colour saturation, to make the game easier to see on an unlit LCD screen. Both games have some new features, including new minigames, hidden pictures, and a Time Trial mode; additionally, the GBA version had multiplayer games. Both versions also have lower sound fidelity and a number of minor changes. Candy Kong no longer runs a save point, so players <b>can</b> <b>save</b> <b>the</b> game in any area.|$|E

[...] A line about the effects of the paradox the TARDIS collision had caused gave an explanation of why the Fifth Doctor looked far older than normal, thus getting around the fact that Peter Davison had left the role over twenty years before.

[...] In 2005, with respect to the U.S. Congress's actions on climate, including its votes on the XL Pipeline, Romm told The Guardian: [...] "Future generations suffering from the consequences of our inaction will be bewildered that the legislative body of the richest country in the world could devote so little effort to ameliorating the climate problem and so much effort to making it worse." ...|$|E
