Fenbendazole (Panacur) at 20 mg/kg for 3-4 days is also effective. Ivermectin injections may be effective in treating resistant strains.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} in vitro {{incubation}} of three henzimidazole anthelmintics, thiabendazole, mebendazole and <b>cambendazole</b> on Strongyloides were compared. No drug affected hatching of S. ratti eggs or {{the viability of}} infective larvae or parasitic adult worms, but all three inhibited moulting of S. ratti larvae. In addition, <b>cambendazole,</b> but not thiabendazole or mebendazole, impaired the viability of S. ratti first- and second-stage larvae. The three drugs {{had no effect on}} isolated S. stercorais free-living adult worms, but they all prevented development of S. stercoralis rhabditiform larvae. Thiabendazole and mebendazole had no effect on the infectivity of either S. ratti or S. stercoralis infective larvae, but infection with these worms was abrogated by prior incubation with <b>cambendazole.</b> These results indicate that <b>cambendazole</b> acts in a different manner to the other two drugs. Since it is active against larvae migrating through the tissues, it is potentially of much greater value than thiabendazole or mebendazole in the therapy of strongyloidiasis...|$|E
40|$|Thiabendazole and <b>cambendazole</b> induced mitotic {{arrest and}} {{isogenic}} diploid formation through chromosome doubling in amoebae of the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum grown either axenically or in a bacterial suspension. The effect of nocodazole on axenically grown cells {{was similar to}} that of thiabendazole and <b>cambendazole,</b> but with cells grown on bacteria nocodazole was a much less effective inducer of mitotic arrest and did not lead to isogenic diploid formation. Benomyl, the active ingredient of ben late, had little or no effect on the induction of mitotic arrest and was a poor inducer of isogenic diploids in cells grown either axenically or on bacteria.

40|$|A multiresidue method (LC-MS/MS) for {{determination}} of {{wide range of}} anthelmintics was developed. The method covered benzimidazoles: albendazole (and metabolites), <b>cambendazole,</b> fenbendazol (and metabolites), flubendazole (and metabolites), mebendazole (and metabolites), oxibendazole, thiabendazole (and metabolites), triclabendazole (and metabolites); macrocyclic lactones: abamectin, doramectin, emamectin, eprinomectin, ivermectin, moxidectin; salicylanilides: closantel, ioxynil, nitroxynil, oxyclosamide, niclosamide, rafoxanid and others: clorsulon, derquantel, imidocarb, monepantel (and metabolites), morantel, praziquantel, and pyrantel. The method {{was used to examine}} the potential presence of anthelmintics in goat and sheep milk and dairy products from the Polish market. A total of 120 samples of milk, yoghurt, cottage cheese, cream cheese, and curd were analysed. None of the samples were found positive above CCα (1 - 10 μg/kg) except for one cottage cheese in which traces of albendazole sulfone were detected (5. 2 ug/kg) and confirmed.

40|$|Dicrocoeliosis {{belongs in}} {{sheep and goats}} among the six {{economically}} most important pasture helminthoses (Hiepe, 1994). Spectrum of definitive hosts is very wide, includes ruminants, non-rumi-nants, and occasionally humans. Anthelmintic con-trol of animal dicrocoeliosis is in respect to location of fluke adults in definitive hosts (thin bile ducts) difficult, several benzimidazoles (albendazole, fenbedazole, luxabendazole, mebendazole, thia-bendazole, <b>cambendazole)</b> or probenzimidazoles (netobimin, thiofanat), praziquantel, closantel, oxy-closanid and diamphenetid were verified. Part of free living animal species (cervids, wild boar, etc.) including mouflon (Ovis musimon) is at present considered in European conditions as game and farm species,. It is generally accepted, that para-sitically positive herds of mentioned species are treatable by administration of anthelmintics mixed with feed without any direct contact with humans. In such conditions, anthelmintics are dosed per kg of body weight in lower doses but administered in longer time schemes (Cordero Del Campillo et al., 1982; Dzakula et al., 1984; Kassai and Fok, 1985).

40|$|The {{viability}} of Ascaris lumbricoides eggs {{passed in the}} feces was evaluated after treatment of patients {{with one of the}} anti-helminthic drugs (thiabendazole, levamisole, <b>cambendazole,</b> pyrantel pamoate, mebendazole or praziquantel). For each drug, a group of 5 children was selected and their feces collected 24 h before treatment and 24, 48 and 72 h after drug administration, except for mebendazole, with the feces being collected throughout the period of treatment. After sedimentation, the total amount of eggs from each collection was transferred to tissue culture flasks containing 10 ml H 2 So 4 O, 1 N, with the addtion of 3 drops of a miconazol solution, and incubated at 28 graus centígrados, individually, for 80 days. The flasks wee maintained open and the culture were oxigenated daily by manual agitation. On the 80 th day of culture, 20 -days-old albino mice were inoculated with 3, 200 embryonated eggs, per os. Larvae were recovered from their lungs and hearts, on the 8 th day after infection, according to Baerman's method (Morais, 1948). Thiabendazole showed 100. 0 % ovicidal capacity as early as 48 after treatment. Inhibition of embrionary development was observed when thiabendazole was used. This drug also had an effect on the eggs infectivity when inoculated into normal mice. No significant effect on embrionary development was observed for the other drugs tested...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to extend {{existing}} knowledge both {{with respect to the}} mode of action of anthelmintics and the biochemical and physiological mechanisms which may be disrupted by drug action. The helminth species examined include nematodes, Ascaris suum, Ascaridia galli and Trichuris ovis and cestodes, Moniezia, T. hydatigena, T. taeniæformis and Echinoccocus granulosus; the anthelmintics studied were methyridine, diethylcarbamazine, pyrantel, morantel, tetramisole, levamisole, dichlorvos, vincofos, <b>cambendazole</b> and mebendazole. The helminth characteristics selected for most intensive study are (a) the occurrence and properties of helminth cholinesterase and (b) the uptake of glucose. The breadth of the study was limited by the availability of fresh material and not all combinations of helminth and drug were investigated. The histochemical localisation of cholinesterase activity in whole mounts and sections of tapeworms using thiocholine esters revealed a complex network of tegumental receptors feeding a nervous system with efferents to suckers, rostellum and hook muscles. It is suggested that tapeworms have reflex arcsinvolving these structures allowing them to maintain their position in the host intestine in spite of peristaltic action. These arcs are susceptible to anticholinesterase anthelmintics. Other cholinesterase activity is associated with the scolex, cirrus, genital pore and sometimes the tegument. High cholinesterase specific activities against acetylthiocholine were measured in Echinococcus scoleces and tapeworms, but lower levels in nematodes. Differential centrifugation of homogenates was used to study their occurrence in the tissue and facilitate further characterisation. However, the enzyme was widely distributed in these species although somewhat higher in the particulate fractions. Activity was increased little, if any, by attempts to solubilise it with the detergent, Triton X- 100. Cholinesterase in some fractions particularly from T. ovis, had a high temperature optimum around 60 C, but never showed the phenomenon of autoinhibition by substrate at concentrations up to 10 - 2 M. Cholinesterase in species of worm with high levels of enzyme was more sensitive to eserine inhibition than those with lower levels. In studies of glucose uptake from the medium by Ascaris and two tapeworms, it was confirmed that transport into Ascaris was strongly inhibited by certain benzimidazole anthelmintics. Transport into Ascaris, but not the cestodes, was also discovered to be sensitive to local anaesthetics such as procaine or lignocaine. Uptake into tapeworms was inhibited by the absence of sodium ions, phlorizin, iodoacetate and dinitrophenol. It was less inhibited by benzimidazoles and not at all by organophosphate anthelmintics, but was sensitive to phenolic drugs such as hexachlorophene and nitroxynil. In the dog and sheep, a number of anthelmintic drugs administered intravenously showed predominantly nicotinic effects on blood pressure and respiration supporting the cholinergic action of these drugs. Although sheep red-cell cholinesterase is more sensitive to inhibition than that of all helminths tested, the oral route of administration of anthelmintics remains safe for the host and effective against intestinal parasitic worms...|$|E
