40|$|AbstractThe Center for Aircraft Structural Life Extension (CAStLE) at the United States Air Force (USAF) Academy has {{undertaken}} work {{to produce a}} standardized test method for determining {{the effect of a}} corrosion inhibitor containing chromate on small scale fatigue damage. CAStLE is specifically focusing their research on the effect of <b>chromate</b> <b>primers</b> on the pit-to-crack transition and crack growth under the USAF damage tolerant flaw size (1. 5 mm). Quantifying the chromate effect on the small damage scale is necessary to provide a baseline to compare the efficacy of new and safer coatings on fatigue life. To correctly account for these factors, bare and <b>chromate</b> <b>primered</b> test specimens of AA 7075 -T 651 were produced with a center hole and a corrosion pit {{at the edge of the}} hole, and subsequently fatigued using representative environments and loading schemes until a thumbnail crack of approximately 1 mm radius was produced. How chromate coatings effect fatigue crack growth is dependent on enough chromate leaching from a coating to reduce the fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) in the time it takes to grow from a 300 μm pit to a 1 mm fatigue crack. The current results suggest that the amount of chromate required to leach from the primer to affect FCGR may be highly dependent on the amount of chloride present...|$|R
25|$|When {{it is not}} {{possible}} to avoid contact, an effective method of material separation is required. If paints or coatings are used for isolation, they should be compatible with both metals. Bituminous or zinc <b>chromate</b> <b>primers</b> can be used between copper and aluminum. Bituminous, zinc chromate, or a red lead primer can be effective in separating copper from iron and other ferrous metals. Taping or gasketing with non-absorptive materials or sealants are effective in separating copper from all other metals. In areas with severe exposure, lead or similar gasketing materials should be used, except between copper and aluminum. Water draining from copper surfaces should be prevented from exposure to aluminum and galvanized steel as traces of copper salts may accelerate corrosion. In some cases, anodizing may protect thicker aluminum, such as aluminum window system mullions.|$|R

The most significant results obtained are given below: a) 	In the Fe-Ni-Cr system the presence of nickel undercoat is necessary to eliminate the large galvanic current that flow between iron and chromium unlike the small current flow between nickel and chromium. b) 	At pores in zinc-aluminium coated steel, steel behaves like hydrogen electrode as long as the pore diameter is small.

40|$|High {{strength}} {{aluminum alloys}} {{are widely used}} in applications (aerospace and vehicle armor) that require exceptional strength or ballistic properties along with low weight. These materials (e. g. Al- 2024, Al- 7075) derive their exceptional properties from the copper added to form the alloys. Unfortunately, galvanic cells are between the copper and the aluminum, making the aluminum alloys highly susceptible to corrosion. Soluble (hexavalent) chromates are still {{the most effective and}} most widely used corrosion inhibitors for aluminum alloys. However, the toxic properties and environmental costs of chromates are well documented; their use and disposal are therefore strictly regulated.

They were prepared from two individual sols: zirconium tetrapropoxide (ZTP) and methacrylic acid (MAA) were added to siloxane sol prepared by mixing tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and organically modified silica 3 -methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysi-lane (MAPTMS). The mixtures were deposited on alloy AA 7075 -T 6 substrate and cured in air under daylight at room temperature or at 100 ◦C without the addition of photo-initiator. Different molar ratios of ZTP and MAA were investigated, as well as the effects of curing temperature and aging time. The corrosion behavior of the coated alloy was examined by electrochemical potentiodynamic measurements and six-month immersion tests in Harrison’s solution, which simulates aircraft conditions. The coatings provided excellent corrosion protection in the atmospheric region and at high anodic potentials up to 7 V, as well as effective protection during long-term immersion.

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{results of}} a {{detailed}} evaluation of {{the properties of the}} anode and the cathode of a mediator-less microbial fuel cell (MFC) and the factors determining the power output of the MFC using different electrochemical techniques are presented in Chapter 1. In the MFC under investigation, the biocatalyst - Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1 - oxidizes the fuel and transfers the electrons directly into the anode which consists of graphite felt. Oxygen is reduced at the cathode which consists of Pt-plated graphite felt. A proton exchange membrane separates the anode and the cathode compartments. The electrolyte was a PIPES buffer solution and lactate was used as the fuel. Separate tests were performed with the buffer solution containing lactate and with the buffer solution with lactate and MR- 1 as anolytes.; Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) carried out at the open-circuit potential (OCP) has been used to determine the electrochemical properties of the anode and the cathode at different anolyte conditions. Cell voltage (V) – current (I) curves were recorded using a potentiodynamic sweep between the open-circuit cell voltage and the short- circuit cell voltage. Power (P) -V curves were constructed from the recorded V-I data and the cell voltage, Vmax, at which the maximum power could be obtained, was determined. P- time (t) curves were obtained by applying Vmax or using a resistor between the anode and the cathode that would result in a similar cell voltage. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were recorded for the anode for the different anolytes. Finally, anodic polarization curves were obtained for the anode with different anolytes and a cathodic polarization curve was recorded for the cathode.; The internal resistance (Rint) of the MFC has been determined {{as a function of the}} cell voltage V using EIS for the MFC described above and a MFC in which stainless steel (SS) balls had been added to the anode compartment. The experimental values of Rint of the MFCs studied here are determined by the sum of the polarization resistance of the anode (Rap) and the cathode (Rcp), and therefore Rint depends on V. The ohmic contribution to the Rint was very small. It has been found that Rint decreased with decreasing cell voltage as the increasing current flow decreased Rap and Rcp. In the presence of MR- 1, Rint was lower by a factor of about 100 than Rint of the MFC with buffer and lactate as anolyte. Additions of SS balls to the anode compartment produced a very large decrease of Rint. For the MFC containing SS balls in the anode compartment no significant further decrease of Rint could be observed when MR- 1 was added to the anolyte.; In Chapter 2, EIS has been used to determine the properties and stability of polymer coatings based on different chromate or chromate-free pretreatments and primers. Five sets of coated aluminum 2024 samples were exposed to 0. 5 N NaCl for a period of 31 days. Impedance spectra of the samples were measured during this period and the changes of the properties of the different coatings were studied as a function of time. From the analysis of the fit parameters of the impedance spectra, it was found that the corrosion protection of the coated samples depended on the type of primer used. The coating with the <b>chromate</b> based <b>primer</b> provided better corrosion protection than the coating with the chromate free primer.; After 31 days of exposure, one sample from each set was scribed and exposed to 0. 5 N NaCl. The corrosion behavior of the scribed coatings was found to be dependent upon the type of pretreatment employed. The samples with the chromate conversion coating pretreatment showed better corrosion resistance in the scribed area than the samples that were treated by the trivalent chromium based method...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{polymerisation}} (ECP) of non conducting polymers to form thin, passive {{films on}} electrodes has received attention {{in recent years}} as a potential adhesion promotion technique. Work on carbon electrodes with applications in the carbon fibre composite industry have shown {{that it is possible to}} enhance adhesion of carbon fibres to the composite matrix through ECP pretreatments. ECP to produce passive coatings on metals has also been studied, however much of this work is concerned with production of corrosion inhibiting films, rather than adhesion promoting layers. ECP methods are a promising alternative to the <b>chromate</b> pretreatments and <b>primers</b> presently used to improve the adhesion and corrosion resistance of organic coatings on metals. This is because they can be non toxic, offer the possibility of pinhole free coatings and can be produced insitu, preventing the need for separate processing. Thin, uniform, reproducible polymer coatings based upon poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly (glycidyl acrylate) (PGA) were produced on stainless steel cathodes from dilute aqueous sulphuric acid containing potassium persulphate. Electrochemical activities of the solutions were identified by cyclic voltammetry. The polymers were confirmed to be PMMA and PGA by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The thickness of the coatings (between 30 and 400 nm) were measured by ellipsometry, and found to increase with increasing treatment time and with less negative electrode potential. The porosity of the coatings was assessed electrochemically and after an annealing treatment the porosity and coating thickness were both found to decrease for the PMMA coatings and remain relatively unchanged for the PGA coatings. The morphology of the ECP coatings were studied by various microscopy techniques. Further characterisation of the PMMA coatings was undertaken in order to clarify the polymerisation mechanism. This involved differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and solubility studies. A free radical polymerisation mechanism has been proposed in which the radicals are long lived resulting in post electrolysis polymerisation and very high molecular weights. The PMMA and PGA ECP coatings were used as tie layers in adhesion tests by adhering aluminium studs onto the ECP surface with the desired adhesive and subsequently pulling the stud off at a reproducible rate with an Instron tensile testing machine. It was conclusively shown that the adhesion strength between the stainless steel and a cyanoacrylate adhesive was improved by the presence of the PMMA ECP tie layer. In contrast the adhesion of the PMMA ECP tie layer to a standard epoxy adhesive was very poor. The adhesion of the PGA ECP tie layers to the stainless steel substrate was too great to be measured by the standard epoxy adhesive, therefore a toughened adhesive was employed to measure the strength of the interaction between the PGA layers and the stainless steel. This study demonstrates that the ECP technique can be used to improve adhesion of metals to adhesives if the tie layers are chemically compatible with both the metallic oxide and the adhesive. The adhesion is proposed to be improved by increased primary and/or secondary bonding at these interfaces and by excellent interfacial contact between the metallic electrode and the electropolymerised tie layer...|$|R
