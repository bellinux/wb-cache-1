25|$|The lone {{ammonium}} molecule problem {{provides a}} problem for Jackson's solution to epiphenomenal ectoplasm. It was proposed by Jaegwon Kim in 1993 when he stated that according to Jackson's idea of supervenience, a possible world W was identical to the actual world, except it possessed an extra ammonium molecule on one of Saturn's rings. This may not seem to provide much of a problem, but because Jackson's solution refers only to minimal physical duplicates, this allows for the mental properties of W to be vastly different from in the actual world. If such a difference would cause mental differences on Earth, {{it would not be}} <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> understanding of physicalism.|$|E

The observed changes in some climate variables, such as Arctic sea ice, {{some aspects of}} precipitation, and patterns of surface pressure, appear to be proceeding much more rapidly than models have projected. The reasons for these differences are not well understood. Nevertheless, the bottom-line conclusion from climate fingerprinting {{is that most of}} the observed changes studied to date are consistent with each other, and are also <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> scientific understanding of how the climate system would be expected to respond to the increase in heat-trapping gases resulting from human activities.|$|E

Each {{of these three}} sequences of measurement operations produces numbers that are <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> subjective idea of hardness. The harder the material to our informal perception, the greater the number it will achieve on our respective hardness scales. Furthermore, experimental results obtained using these measurement methods {{has shown that the}} hardness number can be used to predict the stress required to permanently deform steel, a characteristic that fits in well with our idea of resistance to permanent deformation. However, there is not always a simple relationship between the various hardness scales. Vickers and Rockwell hardness numbers exhibit qualitatively different behaviour when used to describe some materials and phenomena.|$|E

Yet the Quakers have had a long and honorable part in the growth of our nation, and an amicus curiae brief filed in their behalf informs us that, under the test applied to this petitioner, not one of them, if true to the tenets of their faith, could qualify for the bar in Illinois. And {{it is obvious that the}} same disqualification would exist as to every conscientious objector to the use of force, even though the Congress of the United States should continue its practice of absolving them from military service. The conclusion seems to me inescapable that, if Illinois can bar this petitioner from the practice of law it can bar every person from every public occupation solely because he believes in nonresistance, rather than in force.|$|E

On 22 April 2011, a harsh challenge by Brian Mullan led to Zakuani fracturing his tibia and fibula three minutes into {{a game against the}} Colorado Rapids. He was airlifted to hospital and underwent surgery the same day. During recovery, doctors feared that his leg would require amputation because of compartment syndrome. The concern was caused by a lack of blood flow that hurt the nerves connecting the area to his foot. Mullan initially defended the tackle, saying he would make the challenge again. He later apologized in the face of increasing scrutiny and received a 10-game suspension (matching the longest ban in MLS history to date) and a $5,000 fine. Nelson Rodriguez, an executive vice president of MLS, {{said in a statement that}} the disciplinary committee “felt the egregious nature” of Mullan’s foul justified the punishment. 'Mullan’s tackle is the type of play we need to eliminate from our game, and the level of discipline is <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> efforts to do so.' [...] Zakuani missed the remainder of the season, and this injury marked the beginning of the end of his career as a starter in pro soccer.
