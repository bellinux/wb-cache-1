5|$|All {{pleas for}} {{financial}} help are in vain, including {{a private school}} play performed in front of Mr. Burns at his mansion, until Jim Hope, {{the president of a}} company named Kid First Industries, buys the school and privatizes it. The school's staff is replaced, and classes now focus on toys and marketing. Lisa soon discovers that the company that bought Springfield Elementary is a toy company, using students for research to make a new popular toy in time for the <b>Christmas</b> <b>shopping</b> season. She is then frightened by the appearance of a robotic figure. When Bart and Lisa are back at home, watching television, they see an advertisement for a toy named Funzo. It has many features suggested by Springfield Elementary students during a brainstorming session at the school. They visit Jim Hope's office to complain, and he apologetically gives them a free Funzo toy. Bart and Lisa later discover that Funzo is programmed to destroy other toys.|$|E
5|$|The Pine Street {{segment of}} the tunnel was planned to be dug cut-and-cover from the surface. In {{preparation}} for utility relocation work on Pine Street, Metro moved 36 bus routes serving the corridor to other east–west streets in February 1987. On April 27, excavation of the tunnel began with the closure of Pine Street, and its offramp to Interstate 5, to automobile traffic between 3rd Avenue and Boren Avenue. Workers finished digging in late August, allowing the project to progress to concrete pouring for the roadway. Pine Street was briefly re-opened for the <b>Christmas</b> <b>shopping</b> season beginning November 1 {{at the request of}} downtown merchants, with a temporary surface laid over backfill for automobiles and pedestrians. On January 4, the street was closed to automobile traffic once again, along with the intersection of 5th Avenue and Pine Street and the Pike Street offramp of I-5, to install utility lines and a permanent roadway. Pine Street was fully reopened to traffic on November 1, 1988, coinciding with the completion of Westlake Park and the Westlake Center shopping mall, a year ahead of schedule.|$|E

25|$|El Buen Fin is {{an annual}} {{nationwide}} shopping event in Mexico, in existence since 2011 and {{taking place on}} the third weekend of November in Mexico, {{and the beginning of}} the <b>Christmas</b> <b>shopping</b> season. On this weekend, major retailers extend their store hours and offer special promotions, including extended credit terms and price promotions. The purpose of this weekend is to revive the economy by encouraging consumption and improve the quality of life of all Mexican families by implementing promotions and discounts in the prices of various products. It was inspired by the American celebration, Black Friday and emerged as an initiative of Council of Business Coordination, in association with the federal government and private sector organizations.|$|E
25|$|These volumes, {{traditional}} British comic {{and story}} annuals, were published {{each year in}} time for <b>Christmas</b> <b>shopping.</b> They are cloth bound with full-color painted covers and probably came with dust jackets that duplicated the illustrations on the board covers. These dust jackets, however, are seldom found. Interior contents are a mix of original British material (often by McLoughlin) and reprints from American comics, usually Quality. Primary distribution came through the Woolworth's chain where toys matching characters and vehicles from the stories were also on sale. Little {{is known about the}} original pricing of the volumes although some are thought to have been priced at 7/6. No issues were numbered or dated and the order given here may not be entirely accurate. It is clear, however, that the order of issues presented in several British fanzines and publications is hopelessly wrong. It seems likely that the three Supercoloured Comic Annuals and the New Spaceways Comic Annual should be considered part of this series. This would give it an unbroken run of one annual a year from 1949 to 1959 which would nearly correspond with the Buffalo Bill series. Copies of each of these annuals with dated gift inscriptions confirm that the estimate of dates is fairly accurate. British collector Paul Annis' research confirms most of these dates.|$|E

500|$|Marcus began {{yet another}} Neiman-Marcus tradition, the [...] "International Fortnight," [...] in 1957 {{as a way}} to attract {{customers}} in the lull between the fall fashion rush and the <b>Christmas</b> <b>shopping</b> crunch. The idea was inspired by seeing a store in Stockholm, Sweden, that was having a France-themed sales promotion, leading Marcus to propose to the French government a sponsorship of an even more elaborate event in his own store. The initial Fortnight included concurrent events of art, symphonic music, and film at other locations around Dallas, with an Air France jet bringing [...] "writers, painters, government officials, models, and industry leaders." [...] In the years following, the Fortnight focused on various other countries and added related food service as well as items from the relevant country in every department, ending in 1986 with the Australian Fortnight. Other international traditions introduced at Neiman's included Dallas' first espresso bar, brought by Marcus after World War II.|$|E
500|$|The Mint {{began to}} strike {{the first of the}} 1965-dated clad coins, {{quarters}}, on August 23 of that year, making them the first U.S. coins to bear that date. By November 1965, with the <b>Christmas</b> <b>shopping</b> season beginning, the Fed had only 15 million of the old silver quarters in reserve. [...] That month, though, the Mint released over 230 million of the new clad quarters, and stated that an equal number would be issued every month. [...] This figure quadrupled the previous record monthly production. [...] The new dime and half dollar were released in early 1966, a time when flowback to the Fed increased for all denominations being struck except the half dollar. [...] That denomination failed to return to circulation, as they continued to be withdrawn. The Mint continued to strike 1964-dated silver pieces under the authority of the Coinage Act until 1966, when Secretary Fowler announced, [...] "the coin shortage is over". In July 1966, the Treasury announced that coins struck after August 1, 1966, would bear the date of minting.|$|E
