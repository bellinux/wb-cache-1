25|$|Typical SDR SDRAM <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> are 66, 100, and 133MHz (periods of 15, 10, and 7.5ns). <b>Clock</b> <b>rates</b> up to 200MHz were available.|$|E
25|$|Memory {{manufacturers}} {{stated that}} it was impractical to mass-produce DDR1 memory with effective transfer rates in excess of 400MHz (i.e. 400 MT/s and 200MHz external clock) due to internal speed limitations. DDR2 picks up where DDR1 leaves off, utilizing internal <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> similar to DDR1, but is available at effective transfer rates of 400MHz and higher. DDR3 advances extended the ability to preserve internal <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> while providing higher effective transfer rates by again doubling the prefetch depth.|$|E
25|$|Two {{examples}} are hertz (Hz), {{which is used}} to measure the <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> of electronic components, and bit/s, used to measure data transmission speed.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that because}} {{internal}} operations are at 1/2 the <b>clock</b> <b>rate,</b> DDR2-400 memory (internal <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> 100MHz) has somewhat higher latency than DDR-400 (internal <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> 200MHz).|$|R
5000|$|For a given device, {{operating}} {{at a higher}} <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> may require more power. Reducing the <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> or undervolting usually reduces energy consumption; {{it is also possible}} to undervolt the microprocessor while keeping the <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> the same.|$|R
50|$|Maximum <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> is 740 kHz. The 4004 {{had this}} maximum <b>clock</b> <b>rating</b> upon its initial 1971 release.|$|R
25|$|Registered or {{buffered}} memory, which improves {{signal integrity}} (and hence potentially <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> and physical slot capacity) by electrically buffering the signals with a register, {{at a cost}} of an extra clock of increased latency. Those modules are identified by an additional R in their designation, for example PC3-6400R.|$|E
25|$|Microwire, often spelled μWire, is {{essentially}} a predecessor of SPI and a trademark of National Semiconductor. It's a strict subset of SPI: half-duplex, and using SPI mode 0. Microwire chips tend to need slower <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> than newer SPI versions; perhaps 2MHz vs. 20MHz. Some Microwire chips also support a three-wire mode.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{architectural}} {{difference between}} DDR SDRAM designed for different clock frequencies, for example, PC-1600, designed {{to run at}} 100MHz, and PC-2100, designed to run at 133MHz. The number simply designates the data {{rate at which the}} chip is guaranteed to perform, hence DDR SDRAM is guaranteed to run at lower (underclocking) and can possibly run at higher (overclocking) <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> than those for which it was made.|$|E
50|$|The myth arose {{because the}} <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> was {{commonly}} {{taken as a}} simple measure of processor performance, and was promoted in advertising and by enthusiasts without taking into account other factors. The term came into use {{in the context of}} comparing PowerPC-based Apple Macintosh computers with Intel-based PCs. Marketing based on the myth led to the <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> being given higher priority than actual performance, and led to AMD introducing model numbers giving a notional <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> based on comparative performance to overcome a perceived deficiency in their actual <b>clock</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|R
5000|$|System optimization: Some {{systems have}} [...] "bottlenecks", where small {{overclocking}} of one component can help realize the full potential of another component {{to a greater}} percentage than when just the limiting hardware itself is overclocked. For instance: many motherboards with AMD Athlon 64 processors limit the <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> of four units of RAM to 333 MHz. However, the memory performance is computed by dividing the processor <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> (which is a base number times a CPU multiplier, for instance 1.8 GHz is most likely 9×200 MHz) by a fixed integer such that, at a stock <b>clock</b> <b>rate,</b> the RAM would run at a <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> near 333 MHz. Manipulating elements of how the processor <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> is set (usually lowering the multiplier), it is often possible to overclock the processor a small amount, around 100-200 MHz (less than 10%), and gain a RAM <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> of 400 MHz (20% increase in RAM speed, though not in overall system performance).|$|R
40|$|A low {{complexity}} {{system and}} method for operating a receiver {{in order to}} estimate an offset between the actual sample <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> 1 /TS' of a receiver and an intended sample <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> 1 /TS. The receiver captures samples of a received baseband signal at the rate 1 /TS', operates on the captured samples to generate an estimate for the <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> offset, and fractionally resamples the captured samples using the <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> offset. The resampled data represents an estimate of baseband symbols transmitted by the transmitter. The action of operating on the captured samples involves computing an error vector signal and then estimating the <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> offset using the error vector signal. The error vector signal may be computed in different ways depending {{on whether or not}} carrier frequency offset and carrier phase offset are assumed to be present in the received baseband signal.

25|$|DDR3 memory {{chips are}} being made commercially, and {{computer}} systems using them were available from {{the second half of}} 2007, with significant usage from 2008 onwards. Initial <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> were 400 and 533MHz, which are described as DDR3-800 and DDR3-1066 (PC3-6400 and PC3-8500 modules), but 667 and 800MHz, described as DDR3-1333 and DDR3-1600 (PC3-10600 and PC3-12800 modules) are now common. Performance up to DDR3-2800 (PC3 22400 modules) are available for a price.|$|E
25|$|The Core {{microarchitecture}} {{returned to}} lower <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> and improved {{the usage of}} both available clock cycles and power {{when compared with the}} preceding NetBurst microarchitecture of the Pentium 4/D-branded CPUs. The Core microarchitecture provides more efficient decoding stages, execution units, caches, and buses, reducing the power consumption of Core 2-branded CPUs while increasing their processing capacity. Intel's CPUs have varied widely in power consumption according to clock rate, architecture, and semiconductor process, shown in the CPU power dissipation tables.|$|E
25|$|In operation, CAS latency is a {{specific}} number of clock cycles programmed into the SDRAM's mode register and expected by the DRAM controller. Any value may be programmed, but the SDRAM will not operate correctly if it is too low. At higher <b>clock</b> <b>rates,</b> the useful CAS latency in clock cycles naturally increases. 10–15ns is 2–3 cycles (CL2–3) of the 200MHz clock of DDR-400 SDRAM, CL4-6 for DDR2-800, and CL8-12 for DDR3-1600. Slower clock cycles will naturally allow lower numbers of CAS latency cycles.|$|E
50|$|Since the DDR2 {{internal}} clock runs at half the DDR external <b>clock</b> <b>rate,</b> DDR2 memory operating {{at the same}} external data bus <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> as DDR results in DDR2 being able to provide the same bandwidth but with higher latency. Alternatively, DDR2 memory operating at twice the external data bus <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> as DDR may provide twice the bandwidth with the same latency. The best-rated DDR2 memory modules are {{at least twice as}} fast as the best-rated DDR memory modules.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to a higher <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> (up to 800 MHz), the XDR2 differential data lines transfer data at 16 times the system <b>clock</b> <b>rate,</b> transferring 16 bits per pin per clock cycle. This [...] "Hexadecimal Data Rate" [...] is twice XDR's 8× multiplier. The basic burst size has also doubled.|$|R
5000|$|According to the ACPI Specs, the C0 working {{state of}} a modern-day CPU {{can be divided}} into the {{so-called}} [...] "P"-states (performance states) which allow <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> reduction and [...] "T"-states (throttling states) which will further throttle down a CPU (but not the actual <b>clock</b> <b>rate)</b> by inserting STPCLK (stop clock) signals and thus omitting duty cycles.|$|R
25|$|Fifth-generation Athlon Barton-core {{processors}} {{released in}} early 2003 with PR of 2500+, 2600+, 2800+, 3000+, and 3200+. While not operating at higher <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> than Thoroughbred-core processors, they were marked with higher PR by featuring an increased 512kB L2 cache; later models additionally supported an increased 200MHz (400MT/s) front side bus. The Thorton core was a later {{variant of the}} Barton {{with half of the}} L2 cache disabled, and thus was functionally identical to the Thoroughbred-B core. The name Thorton is a portmanteau of Thoroughbred and Barton.|$|E
25|$|The repeating {{sequence}} of states of an LFSR {{allows it to}} be used as a clock divider or as a counter when a non-binary sequence is acceptable, as is often the case where computer index or framing locations need to be machine-readable. LFSR counters have simpler feedback logic than natural binary counters or Gray-code counters, and therefore can operate at higher <b>clock</b> <b>rates.</b> However, it is necessary to ensure that the LFSR never enters an all-zeros state, for example by presetting it at start-up to any other state in the sequence.|$|E
25|$|The X2Y {{footprint}} {{results in}} lower mounted inductance. This is particularly {{of interest for}} use in high-speed digital circuits with <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> of several 100MHz and upwards. There the decoupling of the individual supply voltages on the circuit board is difficult to realize due to parasitic inductances of the supply lines. A standard solution with conventional ceramic capacitors requires the parallel use of many conventional MLCC chips with different capacitance values. Here X2Y capacitors are able to replace up to five equal-sized ceramic capacitors on the PCB. However, this particular type of ceramic capacitor is patented, so these components are still comparatively expensive.|$|E
50|$|QPI {{operates}} at a <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> of 2.4 GHz, 2.93 GHz, 3.2 GHz, 4.0 GHz or 4.8 GHz (4.0 GHz frequency is introduced with the Sandy Bridge-E/EP platform and 4.8 GHz with the Haswell-E/EP platform). The <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> {{for a particular}} link depends on {{the capabilities of the}} components {{at each end of the}} link and the signal characteristics of the signal path on the printed circuit board. The non-extreme Core i7 9xx processors are restricted to a 2.4 GHz frequency at stock reference clocks. Bit transfers occur on both the rising and the falling edges of the clock, so the transfer rate is double the <b>clock</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Mendocino Celeron, {{launched}} 24 August 1998, was {{the first}} retail CPU to use on-die L2 cache. Whereas Covington had no secondary cache at all, Mendocino included 128 KB of L2 cache running at full <b>clock</b> <b>rate.</b> The first Mendocino-core Celeron was clocked at a then-modest 300 MHz but offered almost twice {{the performance of the}} old cacheless Covington Celeron at the same <b>clock</b> <b>rate.</b> To distinguish it from the older Covington 300 MHz, Intel called the Mendocino core Celeron 300A. Although the other Mendocino Celerons (the 333 MHz part, for example) did not have an A appended, some people call all Mendocino processors Celeron-A regardless of <b>clock</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|R

25|$|For years, {{processor}} makers delivered {{increases in}} <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> and instruction-level parallelism, so that single-threaded code executed faster on newer processors with no modification. Now, to manage CPU power dissipation, processor makers favor multi-core chip designs, and software {{has to be}} written in a multi-threaded manner {{to take full advantage}} of the hardware. Many multi-threaded development paradigms introduce overhead, and will not see a linear increase in speed vs number of processors. This is particularly true while accessing shared or dependent resources, due to lock contention. This effect becomes more noticeable as the number of processors increases. There are cases where a roughly 45% increase in processor transistors has translated to roughly 10–20% increase in processing power.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to smart cards, which are simple devices performing a single function, personal computers are doing many things at once. Thus, {{it is much}} more difficult to perform electromagnetic side-channel attacks against them, due to high levels of noise and fast <b>clock</b> <b>rates.</b> Despite these issues, researchers in 2015 and 2016 showed attacks against a laptop using a near-field magnetic probe. The resulting signal, observed for only a few seconds, was filtered, amplified, and digitized for offline key extraction. Most attacks require expensive, lab-grade equipment, and require the attacker to be extremely close to the victim computer. However, some researchers were able to show attacks using cheaper hardware and from distances of up to half a meter. These attacks, however, required the collection of more traces than the more expensive attacks.|$|E
25|$|To {{illustrate}} the comparative performance of Alpha-based systems, some SPEC performance numbers (SPECint95, SPECfp95) are listed below. Note that the SPEC results claim {{to report the}} measured performance of a whole computer system (CPU, bus, memory, compiler optimizer), not just the CPU. Also note that the benchmark and scale changed from 1992 to 1995. However, the figures give a rough impression {{of the performance of}} the Alpha architecture (64-bit), compared with the contemporary HP (64-bit) and Intel-based offerings (32-bit). Perhaps the most obvious trend is that while Intel could always get reasonably close to Alpha in integer performance, in floating point performance the difference was considerable. On the other side, HP (PA-RISC) is also reasonably close to Alpha, but these CPUs are running at significantly lower <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> (MHz). The tables lack two important values: the power consumption and the price of a CPU.|$|E
5000|$|The highest-rated DDR2 modules in 2009 {{operate at}} 533 MHz (1066 MT/s), {{compared}} to the highest-rated DDR modules operating at 200 MHz (400 MT/s). At the same time, the CAS latency of 11.2 ns = 6 / (bus <b>clock</b> <b>rate)</b> for the best PC2-8500 modules is {{comparable to that of}} 10 ns = 4 / (bus <b>clock</b> <b>rate)</b> for the best PC-3200 modules.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{precisely}} Einstein's conclusion in 1911. He considered an accelerating box, {{and noted that}} according to the special theory of relativity, the <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> {{at the bottom of}} the box was slower than the <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> at the top. Nowadays, this can be easily shown in accelerated coordinates. The metric tensor in units where the speed of light is one is: ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> of a CPU is {{most useful}} for {{providing}} comparisons between CPUs {{in the same}} family. The <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> {{is only one of}} several factors that can influence performance when comparing processors in different families. For example, an IBM PC with an Intel 80486 CPU running at 50 MHz will be about twice as fast (internally only) as one with the same CPU and memory running at 25 MHz, while the same will not be true for MIPS R4000 running at the same <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> as the two are different processors that implement different architectures and microarchitectures. Further, a [...] "cumulative clock rate" [...] measure is sometimes assumed by taking the total cores and multiplying by the total <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> (e.g. dual core 2.8 GHz being considered processor cumulative 5.6 GHz). There are many other factors to consider when comparing the performance of CPUs, like the width of the CPU's data bus, the latency of the memory, and the cache architecture.|$|R
25|$|By {{the time}} of Barton's release, the Northwood-based Pentium 4 had become more than {{competitive}} with AMD's processors. Unfortunately for AMD, a simple increase in size of the L2 cache to 512kB did not have nearly the same impact {{as it did for}} Intel's Pentium 4 line, as the Athlon architecture was not nearly as cache-constrained as the Pentium 4. The Athlon's exclusive-cache architecture and shorter pipeline made it less sensitive to L2 cache size, and the Barton only saw an increase of several percent gained in per-clock performance over the Thoroughbred-B it was derived from. While the increased performance was welcome, it was not sufficient to overtake the Pentium 4 line in overall performance. The PR also became somewhat inaccurate because some Barton models with lower <b>clock</b> <b>rates</b> were being given higher PR than higher-clocked Thoroughbred processors. Instances where a computational task did not benefit more from the additional cache {{to make up for the}} loss in raw clock speed created situations where a lower rated (but faster clocked) Thoroughbred would outperform a higher-rated (but lower clocked) Barton.|$|E
25|$|In theory, real-mode {{applications}} {{could be}} directly executed in 16-bit protected mode if certain rules (newly proposed {{with the introduction}} of the 80286) were followed; however, as many DOS programs did not conform to those rules, protected mode was not widely used until the appearance of its successor, the 32-bit Intel 80386, which was designed to go back and forth between modes easily and to provide an emulation of real mode within protected mode. When Intel designed the 286, it was not designed to be able to multitask real-mode applications; real mode was intended to be a simple way for a bootstrap loader to prepare the system and then switch to protected mode; essentially, in protected mode the 80286 was designed to be a new processor with many similarities to its predecessors, while real mode on the 80286 was offered for smaller-scale systems that could benefit from a more advanced version of the 80186 CPU core, with advantages such as higher <b>clock</b> <b>rates,</b> faster instruction execution (measured in clock cycles), and unmultiplexed buses, but not the 24-bit (16 MB) memory space.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{commercial}} PC, the Altair 8800 (by MITS), used an Intel 8080 CPU with a <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> of 2 MHz (2 million cycles per second). The original IBM PC (c. 1981) had a <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> of 4.77 MHz (4,772,727 cycles per second).In 1992, both Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment Corporation broke the difficult 100 MHz limit with RISC techniques in the PA-7100 and AXP 21064 DEC Alpha respectively. In 1995, Intel's P5 Pentium chip ran at 100 MHz (100 million cycles per second). On March 6, 2000, AMD reached the 1 GHz milestone {{a few months}} ahead of Intel. In 2002, an Intel Pentium 4 model was introduced as the first CPU with a <b>clock</b> <b>rate</b> of 3 GHz (three billion cycles per second corresponding to ~3.3×10−10seconds or 0.33 nanoseconds per cycle).
