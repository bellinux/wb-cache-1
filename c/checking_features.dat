The material is then straight if properly processed. Several different types of these machines are available, ranging from position controlled to pressure controlled machines. Also, machines are available with automatic self <b>checking</b> <b>features.</b> If the material has residual stress as in toothed bandsaw blades, the rolls must not uniformly apply cross strain, as the inherent strain will distort the strip. In these cases, rolls exert corrective strain in a linear narrow strip inboard of the edge each side. In the case of sawblades with teeth on, the corrective squeezed strip on the toothed edge is located along the tooth gullet, and corrective squeeze on the toothed side must be about 2.5 times the corrective force on the plain edge.|$|E

50|$|While desktop {{publishing}} software still provides extensive features necessary for print publishing, modern word processors now have publishing capabilities beyond those of many older DTP applications, blurring {{the line between}} word processing and {{desktop publishing}}. In {{the early days of}} graphical user interfaces in the early 1980s, DTP software was in a class of its own when compared to the fairly spartan word processing applications of the time. Programs such as WordPerfect and WordStar were still mainly text-based and offered {{little in the way of}} page layout, other than perhaps margins and line spacing. On the other hand, word processing software was necessary for features like indexing and spell <b>checking,</b> <b>features</b> that are common in many applications today. As computers and operating systems have become more powerful, versatile and user-friendly in the 2010s, vendors have sought to provide users with a single application platform that can meet almost all their publication needs.|$|E
50|$|As IBIS evolved {{with the}} {{participation}} of more companies and industry members, an IBIS Open Forum was created to promote the application of IBIS as a simulation tool format {{and to make sure}} that a standard exists. Many semiconductor vendors supply IBIS models and many EDA vendors sell IBIS-compliant software tools. In 1995 the IBIS Open Forum teamed with the American National Standards Institute/Electronic Industries Alliance (ANSI/EIA). IBIS version 2.1 was the first version released by the new alliance. It added the ability to simulate ECL and PECL buffers as well as differential lines. IBIS 3.2 allows for a package model description along with an electrical board description. IBIS Version 5.0 was ratified by the IBIS Open Forum on August 29, 2008. Compared to the previous version (IBIS 4.2, ANSI/EIA-656-B), it adds a new flow based not on SPICE transient but on a channel simulator (called algorithmic model application program interface or AMI flow), power integrity, and EMC <b>checking</b> <b>features.</b> For power integrity, it uses Touchstone 2.0 S-parameter files with per-port reference impedance specification.|$|E

Scrambling as movement {{is incompatible with}} central assump-tions of the Minimalist Program: it cannot involve the checking of strong categorial features. Concentrating on German, the article refutes the standard empirical arguments for scrambling and shows that free constituent order is a base-generated phenomenon. The article pro-poses that -role assignment is a by-product of checking the formal features of arguments. When <b>checking</b> <b>features</b> are strong, word order is fixed; when <b>checking</b> <b>features</b> are weak, free constituent order arises owing to a relativized interpretation of the Minimal Link Condition...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. GreatSPN is a {{tool for}} the {{definition}} and solution of Generalized Stochas-tic Petri Nets (GSPN). This paper presents the model <b>checking</b> <b>features</b> that have been recently introduced in GreatSPN. Through a new (Java-based) graphical in-terface for the GSPN model definition, the user can now access the model check-ers of three different logics: the classical branching temporal logic CTL, and two stochastic logics, CSL and its superset CSLTA. This allows to integrate easily classical and probabilistic verification. A distinctive feature of the CTL model checker {{is the ability of}} generating counter-examples and witnesses. The CTL model checker is symbolic, the implementation being based on the symbolic data structures of the Meddly library [5], developed at Iowa State University, while the CSLTA model checker uses advanced solution methods recently developed for Markov Renewal Processes...|$|E
40|$|Fault {{tolerance}} {{features in}} the first three major subsystems appearing in the next generation of communications satellites are described. These satellites will contain extensive but efficient high-speed processing and switching capabilities to support the low signal strengths associated with very small aperture terminals. The terminals' numerous data channels are combined through frequency division multiplexing (FDM) on the up-links and are protected individually by forward error-correcting (FEC) binary convolutional codes. The front-end processing resources, demultiplexer, demodulators, and FEC decoders extract all data channels which are then switched individually, multiplexed, and remodulated before retransmission to earth terminals through narrow beam spot antennas. Algorithm based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques, which relate real number parity values with data flows and operations, are used to protect the data processing operations. The additional <b>checking</b> <b>features</b> utilize resources that can be substituted for normal processing elements when resource reconfiguration is required to replace a failed unit...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Ensuring {{correctness}} of real-world {{software applications}} is a challenging task. Testing {{can be used}} to ﬁnd many bugs, but is typically not sufficient for proving correctness or even eliminating entire classes of bugs. However, formal proof and verification techniques tend to be very heavy weight and are simply not available for day to day use in many common programming environments. We demonstrate a form of light-weight proof assistant by using the type <b>checking</b> <b>features</b> of the programming language Haskell with existing extensions. We apply this work to the Open Source version control system Darcs. The properties checked by our approach are derived directly from the data model used by Darcs. This allows us to eliminate entire classes of bugs at compile time. We also examine how these techniques improve the quality of the Darcs codebase and the challenges that arise when applying these techniques in practice...|$|E

Accordingly, Tasmanian provenances are recommended over mainland ones for New Zealand plantations, even though tree form is not as good...|$|E
40|$|Group {{decision}} making is usually performed {{in the presence of}} conflicting goals and criteria, brought up by spatially dispersed parties with different backgrounds and interests. Recent advances in information technology and computer science may satisfactorily address a variety of related problems, such as communication among the decision makers and efficient elicitation and representation of the domain knowledge. Furthermore, they may significantly automate the {{decision making}} process itself. On the other hand, the inherent uncertainty of the problem advocates the use of approximation models, often coming from the fuzzy sets discipline. This paper presents an integrated framework for multiple criteria decision making among groups on the World Wide Web. The agents involved use a fully implemented argumentative discourse system to pursue their criteria and objectives, the aim being the specification of the desired solution to the problem.
