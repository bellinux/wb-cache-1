5|$|Like his predecessor, Bill Dellinger's {{involvement}} with the University of Oregon began before his coaching career.

The 25–7 overall (14–4, Big Ten) 1976 team lost to an undefeated Indiana {{team in the}} NCAA championship game, and Orr earned National Association of Basketball Coaches Coach of the Year honors that season. The 26–4 overall (16–2, Big Ten) 1977 team finished first in both the AP and UPI national rankings, and Orr won Basketball Weekly National Coach of the Year honors. During Orr's tenure, six players earned a total of seven All-American recognitions, {{which is the most}} of any Michigan <b>coach.</b> <b>Steve</b> Grote became Michigan's only three-time first-team Academic All-American from 1975–77 and with a second team All Big Ten as well as three honorable mentions was the first four-time All-Big Ten honoree.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, {{following}} the World Series, the Phillies released third base <b>coach</b> <b>Steve</b> Smith. Smith {{had been with}} the team for two years. The Phillies were expected to have the remaining coaches to return for the 2009 season. However, bench coach Jimy Williams opted not to return to the Phillies for the 2009 season, notifying the team on November 10. Charlie Manuel had expected Williams to return for the 2009 season, and was surprised that he declined. However, Williams left the team on good terms, and Manuel stated that he was welcome {{to come back to the}} Phillies if he changed his mind. Left fielder Pat Burrell became a free agent at the end of the 2008 season, signing with the Tampa Bay Rays, whom the Phillies had defeated in the World Series, on January 5. The team did not tender an offer to Burrell following eight seasons. The Phillies also released outfielder So Taguchi on November 5. Taguchi had served as a pinch-hitter for the Phillies in 2008, and also replaced Burrell in left field some games. Eric Bruntlett replaced Taguchi for the latter half of the 2008 season. Relief pitcher Tom Gordon also filed for free agency, ultimately signing with the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E
5|$|After the 2014 Finals, LeBron James {{became a}} free agent and {{returned}} to the Cleveland Cavaliers where he teamed up with Kyrie Irving. The Cavs also traded for Kevin Love to form a new Big Three in Cleveland as they led the Cavs to the 2015 NBA Finals. In the 2015 postseason, 2014 finalist Miami Heat did not qualify in the playoffs after losing James to free agency and due to mediocrity stemming from brutal injuries all season, and the former defending champions, the San Antonio Spurs, were eliminated in a Game 7 battle against the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round. This allowed Cleveland to conquer the East. Golden State, spearheaded by reigning MVP, Stephen Curry, achieved a 67–15 record and were able to take the West. Entering the 2015 Finals, James and current Cavalier and former Heat teammate James Jones made their fifth straight finals appearance – the first two players to do this since the 1960s Celtics. The Warriors managed to defy conventional wisdom and traditionalist ideas by winning the championship with a small-ball, three-point shooting, fast-paced team. The Warriors won Game 1 in overtime, with the Cavaliers losing Irving to injury in the process. The Cavaliers would win Games 2 and 3, however, the Warriors won the next three games after <b>coach</b> <b>Steve</b> Kerr made the adjustment of inserting sixth man Andre Iguodala into the starting lineup in place of center Andrew Bogut, thus achieving the desired small-ball offense. The Warriors defeated the Cavaliers 4–2, with Iguodala becoming the first player to not start in any regular season game to win the Finals MVP award.|$|E

5|$|Following Brodie's departure, two strikers were signed; Leon Constantine joined on a {{contract}} {{until the end of}} the season after leaving Hereford United and youth-team <b>coach</b> <b>Steve</b> Torpey was registered as a player. Till and debutant Constantine scored in the space of two minutes in a 2–0 home win over Rushden & Diamonds. Striker David Dowson, defender Jamal Fyfield and midfielder Danny Racchi joined the club on trial and played for the reserve team against Chesterfield. Having fallen a goal behind, York earned a 1–1 draw away to Wrexham after Till scored the equalising goal. Ahead of York's home match against Hayes & Yeading United, the club signed Fyfield from Maidenhead United for a nominal fee and Racchi from Wrexham, where he had been on non-contract terms. The same day, York beat Hayes & Yeading 2–0 with goals from Rankine and Constantine, the latter making his first start for the club. York were defeated 5–0 away by Mansfield Town, with Jonathan Smith being sent off on 34 tminutes after receiving a second yellow card. Hopcutt and Lisles were loaned out to Stokesley of the Northern League Division One. Manager Foyle resigned 10 matches into the season, with the team 15th in the table, and assistant manager Andy Porter was appointed caretaker manager. Porter's first match in charge was a 3–1 away victory over Tamworth, York's first away win of the season, with goals scored from Rankine, Alex Lawless and debutant Fyfield. Ahead of this match, Dowson was signed and made his debut as an 85th-minute substitute. The first home match of Porter's tenure was a 0–0 draw with Darlington, which was York's first televised appearance on sports channel Premier Sports.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, {{while still}} {{a member of}} the under-21 team, Carson was called up to the England senior team squad for the team's tour of the United States later that month. A year later, he came on as {{substitute}} for Robert Green, who had suffered a serious injury, in the England B international friendly against Belarus in May 2006. The injury to Green, who had been named in the England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, led to Carson, who was on standby, being promoted to the England squad for the tournament, although he did not make any appearances. Carson continued to be selected for the England senior team squad, and in May 2007, made his second appearance for the England B team in a 3–1 win over Albania. Following the 2007 UEFA Under-21 Championships, he made his full England debut in a friendly against Austria in November 2007 when he kept a clean sheet. A week later, he made his competitive debut in a crucial match against Croatia, which England lost 3–2, resulting in their failure to qualify for UEFA Euro 2008. Carson was held particularly culpable for the first goal, when Niko Kranjčar's speculative shot from 30 yards dipped and bounced in front of him, with Carson only succeeding in parrying the ball into the net. England <b>coach</b> <b>Steve</b> McClaren was sacked the next day, as commentators criticised McClaren for selecting an inexperienced goalkeeper for the match.|$|E
5|$|Palace {{turned to}} former Manchester United captain Steve Bruce as their {{manager for the}} 2001–02 season. A good start gave the club hope for a {{promotion}} challenge, but Bruce then tried to walk out on the club after only four months in charge after being approached by Birmingham City to become their new manager. Palace put Bruce on gardening leave while they searched for a new manager. The club eventually allowed Bruce to join Birmingham, and he was replaced by Trevor Francis, ironically his predecessor at the Midlands club Under Francis, Palace finished mid-table for two successive seasons, and Francis left {{to be replaced by}} long-serving <b>coach</b> <b>Steve</b> Kember. Kember guided Palace to victories in their opening three games of the 2003–04 Division One campaign, which put Palace {{at the top of the}} table, but he was sacked in November after a terrible loss of form saw them slip towards the bottom three. Caretaker player-manager Kit Symons, was put in charge of first-team duties for a month and oversaw an improvement in form before the appointment of Iain Dowie as manager was made. Dowie, a former Palace player, transformed the club from relegation candidates at Christmas into play-off contenders in April, where they overcame West Ham United in the Play-off Final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on Saturday 29 May 2004. A goal from captain Neil Shipperley was enough for them to win the match 1–0, and with it a return to the Premiership. Palace once again could not maintain their seat at the top table, however, and again dropped down a division in spite of the 21 Premiership goals struck by Andrew Johnson, the second highest goalscorer in the division. Palace now held the unwanted distinction of being the only team to have been relegated from the Premier League four times.|$|E
