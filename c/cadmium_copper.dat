25|$|In initial {{versions}} of the SEM-AVS approach, six metals were measured: nickel, zinc, <b>cadmium,</b> <b>copper,</b> lead, and mercury. More current methods call for the measurement of silver {{in addition to these}} metals.|$|E
30|$|To {{estimate}} the adsorption rate constant of <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper,</b> the first-order model was used. The rate constant (k 1) for <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> adsorption onto NJ zeolite were 0.5145, 0.325, respectively. Meanwhile the second-order reaction rate constant (k 2) for <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> adsorption onto NJ zeolite were 2.32145, 1.716, respectively.|$|R
30|$|Recently, Rao et al. (2005) {{evaluated}} the sorption process for <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> from aqueous solutions using activated coal. The effect of initial heavy metal load, adsorbent mass, and time contacting on adsorption ability were estimated. They analyzed and correlated the experimental data according to both Freundlich and Langmuir model. The highest uptake of <b>copper</b> and <b>cadmium</b> {{was found to}} be 20  mg/g for <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper.</b> The maximum uptake capacities of <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> were 88 and 90  %, respectively.|$|R
30|$|In this article, the {{adsorption}} process of <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> using natural Jordanian (NJ) zeolite as adsorbent has been experimentally estimated. The samples of NJ zeolite {{were obtained from}} Al Mafraq discrete, north east of Jordan. The influence of the bulk concentration (C o), contact time (t) and different adsorbent masses (m) of NJ zeolite on the removal of heavy metal were evaluated. These variables had a considerable function in promoting the sorption process of heavy metal using the NJ zeolite. The initial concentration of heavy metals in the stock solution was extended between 80 and 600  mg/L. The batch adsorption method was employed to investigate the {{adsorption process}}. The experimental data were correlated using Freundlich and Langmuir empirical formula. The ability of NJ zeolite to eliminate <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> was estimated according to Langmuir isotherm empirical formula and found 25.9 and 14.3  mg/g for <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper,</b> respectively. The kinetics of adsorption of <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> have been analyzed and correlated by first-order and second-order reaction model. It was noticed that adsorption of <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> was better correlated with pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The results presented that NJ zeolite is practical adsorbent for removing <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> ion metal.|$|R

25|$|For certain applications, {{copper alloy}} {{conductors}} are preferred instead of pure copper, especially when higher strengths or improved abrasion and corrosion resistance properties are required. However, relative to pure copper, the higher strength and corrosion resistance benefits that are offered by copper alloys are offset by their lower electrical conductivities. Design engineers weigh {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of the various types of copper and copper alloy conductors when determining which type to specify for a specific electrical application. An example of a copper alloy conductor is <b>cadmium</b> <b>copper</b> wire, which is used for railroad electrification in North America. In Britain the BPO (later Post Office Telecommunications) used <b>cadmium</b> <b>copper</b> aerial lines with 1% cadmium for extra strength; for local lines 40lb/mile (1.3mm dia) and for toll lines 70lb/mile (1.7mm dia).|$|E
25|$|The {{eruption}} claimed no fatalities, {{however it}} did lead to water {{pollution in the}} region, including increases in <b>cadmium,</b> <b>copper</b> and lead concentrations in local rivers. An increase of mercury from the eruption was detected as far as Laguna del Plata, Argentina. The 1993 eruption {{was followed by a}} significant increase in the fluorine content of plants covered by the ash. Regulatory limits on concentrations of other elements in water were also exceeded, although only temporarily.|$|E
30|$|The Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms {{models are}} used to {{describe}} the experimental adsorption results meanwhile the pseudo-first- and second-order kinetics model are used for kinetic rate elaboration. It was set that the Freundlich empirical is well demonstrated and fitting the experimental results. The metal ion uptake capacities for <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> were 25.9 and 14.3  mg/g, respectively. The calculated adsorption intensity parameter correlated to Langmuir isotherm model for <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> are 9.5 and 7.36, respectively. <b>Cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> adsorption from aqueous solution using NJ zeolite was well demonstrated with the second-order kinetic model. The experimental adsorption data were better adequate to the second-order model than to the first-order model. As a result of this study, the NJ zeolite for the removal of <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> using a batch adsorption technique has inherent advantages.|$|R
30|$|The {{sorption}} kinetic {{results of}} <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> on the NJ zeolite were analyzed according to {{first and second}} sorption kinetic equation (Sevil and Bilge 2007). Samples were sucked from the glass bottle every 2  min using glass syringe. The remaining of <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> concentration in the solution was also analyzed by AAS (atomic absorption spectrophotometer).|$|R
30|$|The {{adsorption}} percentage {{increased with}} zeolite mass {{in case of}} both <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> and when the adsorbent reaches beyond 30  mg became steady. The adsorption percentage was found to be 46, 15.5  % in the case of <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper,</b> respectively, for identical zeolite dose (1  mg). It is clear that the uptake efficiency of <b>cadmium</b> and <b>copper</b> increases with the concentration of NJ zeolite. The reason for this may be the surface area of the zeolite at higher mass concentration of zeolite is more available. Therefore, the heavy metal ions have the possibility to exchange their sites over a large available surface area.|$|R
500|$|The velvet belly's liver {{accounts}} for 17% {{of its body}} mass, three-quarters of which is oil, making it nearly neutrally buoyant. To deal with the higher concentrations of heavy metals in the deep sea, the velvet belly has T-cells in its bloodstream that can identify and mark toxic compounds for elimination. These T-cells are produced by a lymphomyeloid gland in its esophagus called a [...] "Leydig's organ", which {{is also found in}} some other sharks and rays. In its liver, specialized proteins are also capable of detoxifying <b>cadmium,</b> <b>copper,</b> mercury, zinc, and other toxic contaminants. The velvet belly's bioluminescence is thought to function in counter-illumination, which eliminates the shark's silhouette and camouflages it from upward-looking predators. Its bioluminescence may also serve a social function, such as finding mates or co-ordinating groups, as the pattern is species-specific. The velvet belly is an important food of larger fishes such as other sharks; a major predator of this species is the longnosed skate (Dipturus oxyrinchus).|$|E
500|$|The Saw Mill River's {{water quality}} varies, {{reflecting}} {{its history and}} surroundings. Its headwaters {{in the town of}} New Castle are considered [...] "relatively healthy". There the river is less disturbed, and its ecosystem supports a diversity of organisms. In Yonkers, where it flows through a concrete-lined channel, there is less life in the water and it is considered to be environmentally impaired. A 1983 United States Geological Survey (USGS) study found that concentrations of heavy metals in the water increased further downstream, a phenomenon observed with many other pollutants in the river and correlated with the urbanization around and above its mouth. DDT was detected in the streambed sediments throughout the river. In its final , more than 50 micrograms of PCBs were found per kilogram of water. In the 1990s, the USGS found that of the 35 Hudson tributaries it tested, the Saw Mill had the worst levels of <b>cadmium,</b> <b>copper,</b> mercury, nickel and zinc in the sediments near its mouth, and among the worst nationwide (however, only the river's manganese levels were found to exceed federal standards).
