40|$|Culminating-point filter {{construction}} for particle {{points is}} distinguished from torus construction for wave {{functions in the}} tangent objects of their neighborhoods. Both constructions are not united by a general manifold diffeomorphism, but are united by a map of a hidden conformal S^ 1 × S^ 3 charge with harmonic (Maxwell) potentials into a physical space formed by <b>culminating</b> <b>points,</b> tangent objects, and Feynman connections. The particles are obtained from three classes of eigensolutions of the homogeneous potential equations on S^ 1 × S^ 3. The map of the u(2) invariant vector fields into the Dirac phase factors of the connections yields the electro-weak Lagrangian with explicit mass operators for the massive leptons. The spectrum of massive particles is restricted by the small, manageable number of eigensolution classes and an instability of the model for higher mass values. This instability also defines the huge numbers of filter elements needed for the <b>culminating</b> <b>points.</b> Weinberg angle, current coupling constant, and lepton masses are calculated or estimated from the renormalization of filter properties. Consequences for particle astrophysics follow, on the one hand, from the restriction of particle classes and, on the other hand, from the suggestion of new particles from the three classes e. g. of dark matter, of a confinon for the hadrons, and of a prebaryon.

60|$|I am in {{the habit}} of looking to the Yorkshire drawings, as {{indicating}} one of the <b>culminating</b> <b>points</b> in Turner's career. In these he attained the highest degree of what he had up to that time attempted, namely, finish and quantity of form united with expression of atmosphere, and light without color. His early drawings are singularly instructive in this definiteness and simplicity of aim. No complicated or brilliant color is ever thought of in them; they are little more than exquisite studies in light and shade, very green blues being used for the shadows, and golden browns for the lights. The difficulty and treachery of color being thus avoided, the artist was able to bend his whole mind upon the drawing, and thus to attain such decision, delicacy, and completeness as have never in any wise been equalled, and as might serve him for a secure foundation in all after experiments. Of the quantity and precision of his details, the drawings made for Hakewill's Italy, are singular examples. The most perfect gem in execution is {{a little bit on the}} Rhine, with reeds in the foreground, in the possession of B. G.

I could as fully, though not with the accuracy and certainty derived from personal observation, have illustrated the principles subsequently advanced, from the architecture of Egypt, India, or Spain, as from that to which the reader will find his attention chiefly directed, the Italian Romanesque and Gothic.

The adoption of the antiphlogistic system of Lavoisier in the Netherlands is one of the <b>culminating</b> <b>points</b> in the history of chemistry in that country. At the end of the eighteenth century the dutch chemists were the first adherents of the system of Lavoisier. They published not only a number of excellent articles about the new system, but they also carried out a great number of original experiments in favour of Lavoisier's theory. A clear exposition of this system was given for the first time by van Marum (1787) and Nieuwland (1791); furthermore Nahuys (1788) and de Fremery and van Werkhoven (1800) are to be mentioned. The last two gave a literal translation of Lavoisier's «Traite elementaire de Chimie» in the dutch language. In the great Lavoisier-bibliography, Duveen and Klickstein mentioned only the translation by de Fremery and van Werkhoven and the work of Nieuwland as expositions of Lavoisier's theory in the dutch language. Recently McKie in his preface to the facsimile-edition of the english translation of Lavoisier's work gives the same information: Partington also gave only these two dutch works.
