In his 2001 book Tell Me A Story, CBS producer Don Hewitt said that he told Rather to go to Zapruder's home to [...] "sock him in the jaw", take the film, copy it, then return it and let the network's lawyers deal with the consequences. According to Hewitt, he realized his mistake after ending their telephone conversation and immediately called Rather back to countermand the order.

2500|$|From {{the time}} the CBS {{affiliates}} joined Walter Cronkite in the news room at around 2:00p.m. EST to approximately 2:38p.m. EST, the coverage alternated from the CBS Newsroom to KRLD-TV's Eddie Barker at the Dallas Trade Mart where President Kennedy was to give his luncheon address. [...] In the 15 to 20 minutes before Kilduff's official announcement, rumors of the President's death were broadcast on radio and TV.

2500|$|For many years, channel 13's newscasts {{had placed}} {{third in the}} ratings behind WISH and WRTV, even with NBC's primetime lineup as a lead-in.

It eventually overtook WISH-TV for first in all news timeslots in 2002. The station's ratings lead—which WTHR emphasizes in the slogan it adopted upon taking first place full-time, [...] "Indiana's News Leader"—began to narrow in 2010 as WISH-TV and Fox affiliate WXIN (channel 59) saw viewership gains that year as WTHR’s ratings steadily decreased in certain timeslots, especially on weekday mornings. Despite decreased ratings for NBC's primetime schedule since the 2004-05 season, WTHR remains in a close battle with WISH for the #1 slot in the 11:00p.m. timeslot.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his book}} This Just In: What I Couldn't Tell You on TV, <b>CBS</b> <b>News</b> <b>correspondent</b> Bob Schieffer, who was {{serving as a}} {{reporter}} for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram when Cronkite's editorial aired, acknowledged that Johnson did not see the original broadcast but also defended the allegation that Johnson had made the remark. According to Schieffer, Johnson's aide George Christian [...] "told me that the President apparently saw some clips of it the next day" [...] and that [...] "That's when he made the remark about Cronkite. But he knew then that it would take more than Americans were willing to give it." [...] When asked about the remark during a 1979 interview, Christian claimed he had no recollection about what the President had said. In his 1996 memoir A Reporter's Life, Cronkite claimed he was at first unsure about how much of an impact his editorial report had on Johnson's decision to drop his bid for re-election, and what eventually convinced him that the President had made the statement was Bill Moyers, fellow journalist and former aide to Johnson, telling him [...] "The president flipped off the set and said 'If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost Middle America.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{high number}} of losses {{resulted}} in the formation at Jorhat in July 1943 {{of one of the}} first search and rescue organizations, nicknamed [...] "Blackie's Gang." [...] A former test pilot and a Hump veteran, Capt. John L. [...] "Blackie" [...] Porter directed the unit using C-47s borrowed from airlift units that were crewed by a dozen former barnstormers and enlisted personnel armed with submachine guns and hand grenades. [...] "Blackie's Gang" [...] accounted for virtually every crewman recovered in 1943, including <b>CBS</b> <b>News</b> <b>correspondent</b> Eric Sevareid and 19 others forced to parachute on 2 August. The unit moved to Chabua on 25 October and was given official status and allotted two C-47s and several L-5 Sentinel liaison planes for rescue pickups. Porter recruited volunteer medics to parachute into crash sites to aid injured crewmen. In late November he added two B-25 Mitchells to his small fleet from aircraft that had been consigned to a salvage field. Porter was killed in action on 10 December 1943, when his B-25 was set on fire by Japanese Zero fighters during a search mission and crashed at the Indian border trying to return to base.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that Johnson decided to wind down his re-election bid after popular and influential CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite turned against the president's policy in Vietnam and recommended peace negotiations during a CBS News editorial which aired on February 27. [...] After later watching Cronkite's editorial, Johnson allegedly exclaimed [...] "if I've lost Cronkite, I've lost Middle America." [...] Issues surrounding reports of this allegation have raised questions about its accuracy, such {{as the fact that}} Johnson was attending Texas Governor John Connally's birthday gala in Austin, Texas, when Cronkite's editorial aired and thus was unable to see the original broadcast. [...] However, Cronkite and <b>CBS</b> <b>News</b> <b>correspondent</b> Bob Schieffer defended reports that the remark had been made and claimed that members of Johnson's inner circle who had watched the editorial with the president, including presidential aide George Christian and journalist Bill Moyers, were able to confirm its accuracy to them at a later time. Schieffer, who was serving as a reporter for the Star-Telegrams WBAP television station in Fort Worth, Texas, when Cronkite's editorial aired, acknowledged reports that the president saw the editorial's original broadcast were inaccurate, but claimed the president was able to watch a taping of it the morning after it aired and then made the remark.|$|E
