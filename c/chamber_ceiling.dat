25|$|When {{founding}} a new colony, young queens either {{shed their}} wings prior to excavating the nest or just inside. They then excavate a tunnel {{to a depth}} of roughly 10 cm (4 in) and create a primary chamber. The dealate, or wingless, queen then carries the wings into the primary chamber and inserts them into the <b>chamber</b> <b>ceiling</b> where the surface of the wings is used as a platform for growing an incipient fungus garden. She will also forage around the nest entrance for caterpillar droppings to feed the fungus garden. The female fore wings of all so-called Paleoattini (the genera Mycocepurus, Apterostigma, and Myrmicocrypta) have a crescent-shaped spot lacking any veins, hairs, and pigmentation, and is thought to provide an “easy to clean” platform for the fungus garden. Queens of the socially parasitic species Mycocepurus castrator do not found their colonies independently, and interestingly the clear spot is absent from their wings. This indirectly supports the idea that the wing spot has a function during the early colony founding and fungus cultivation stage of independently founding Mycocepurus queens.|$|E

The slab can be joined with the ceiling stones of two other monuments, the Table des Marchands dolmen and the Er Vinglé tomb, at Locmariaquer, at a distance of 4 km.

In this research the failure of Nimonic 80 A insert bolts, which connect the air duct rings to the combustion <b>chamber</b> <b>ceiling,</b> in a 159 MW unit is investigated. The bolts operating at about 650 ºC, failed prematurely after a service life of 36000 h.

Several insert bolts were retrieved from the accident site and used in this study. The investigation mainly included visual examinations, nondestructive testing, hardness testing, optical emission spectroscopy, metallography, and SEM fractography. The fracture location of the bolts was {{at the root of}} the first or second thread. Fractographic examinations identified intergranular creep rupture by wedge-shaped cracking as the operating failure mechanism.

40|$|Neotropical ants in {{the tribe}} Attini share the obhgatory {{behaviour}} of cultivating fungi {{as an essential}} food source. Of this complex and well-studied mutualism, {{little is known about}} the biological traits of the phylogenetically basal attines, which may offer important clues to the origins and early evolution of this intricate symbiosis. In this paper we focus on the founding of new nests, a key to understanding evolutionary changes in many social insects, which has received comparatively little attention in attine ants. We present a comparative survey of nest-founding behav-iour in Attini, based on 441 foundress nests of 20 species in eight attine genera. In general, attine queens are semi-claustral and haplometrotic when founding nests. We show that attine foundresses of most species use an inert platform (discarded forewings, roots, or rocks) on which the incipient fungal garden is physically isolated during nest foundation, and they conduct semiclaustral foundation. This behaviour is not shared with Atta, which places the incipient garden directly on the soil floor of the initial nest chamber, and conducts claustral foundation. Nest-founding maps congruently onto the major clades in attine phylogeny, suggesting that the behavioural mech-anisms used to isolate the incipient garden may have been key innovations in the early evolution of attine fungi-culture. The evolutionary sequence of gardening in Attini suggests a transformation series from retention and use of detached wings (suspended from the <b>chamber</b> <b>ceiling</b> or placed over the chamber floor) to root-suspension, and finally use of bare soil.

40|$|Limbic {{innervation}} of {{the nucleus}} accumbens via the ventral subiculum/hippocampus and basolateral {{area of the}} amygdala {{has been shown to}} determine dissociable aspects of behaviour controlled by stimuli associated with natural rewards. However, the respective contributions of the ventral subiculum and amygdala to behaviour governed by drug-associated stimuli remain to be determined. Experiments consisted of two phases: drug-stimulus training, and subsequent stimulus-only testing. Initial training sessions were of two alternating forms. During drug sessions, responding upon one lever resulted in an infusion of l Î¼g d-amphetamine into the nucleus accumbens, whilst during saline sessions d-amphetamine was replaced with saline. Each infusion (drug or saline) was preceded with either a light, or tone. Responding upon a control lever had no programmed consequences. Following training, the levers were retracted, and instead two novel vertical bars were extended from the <b>chamber</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Movement of one bar produced the drug-associated stimulus, whilst the alternative bar produced the saline- associated stimulus. Infusions of the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX into the ventral subiculum or basolateral area of the amygdala (0, 0. 2, 2. 0 nmol) were made immediately before the start of each session. Intra-basolateral area of the amygdala CNQX reduced responding upon the drug-associated stimulus bar, {{but at the same time}} increased responding upon the saline-associated stimulus bar. By contrast, intra-ventral subiculum CNQX reduced drug-associated stimulus responding selectively. Neither manipulation affected levels of activity within the operant chamber extraneous to the bar-pushing response. Hence, the basolateral area of the amygdala appeared to have determined the degree of discriminative control exerted over behaviour by the drug- associated stimulus, whilst the ventral subiculum is suggested to have determined the efficacy of the conditioned reward...|$|E

Bockner does so and falls into the lake, only to be seized in the jaws of a Mokele-mbembe and dragged beneath the water.
