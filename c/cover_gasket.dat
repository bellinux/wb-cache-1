25|$|In April 2009, {{the recall}} already posted for the Supercharged {{iterations}} of the 3800 Series II was expanded {{to cover all}} 3800 Series II engine-equipped vehicles after many fires were reported with Grand Prix GT and 3.8L equipped SE versions, {{as well as the}} sister car Buick Regal LS. The recall for the non-supercharged V6 was to remove the front spark plug retainer and a valve <b>cover</b> <b>gasket</b> is not changed on non-supercharged 3.8 engines. The recall covered nearly 1.5 million vehicles.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, GM {{announced}} a recall on all 1997â€“2003 Grand Prix GTP models (as well as sister car Buick Regal GS) {{due to a}} problem that causes fires in the engine compartment. Over 230 fires were reported. This recall affected over 200,000 vehicles equipped with the supercharged 3800 Series II engine. GM {{sent a letter to}} the owners of these vehicles on March 13, 2008, instructing them not to park in garages or carports until the problem was resolved. The recall for the Supercharged engine involved changing the left (front) valve <b>cover</b> <b>gasket,</b> as oil leaks onto the exhaust manifold may cause engine fires. Some believed this recall did not fix the fire problem, and instead the problem is likely faulty fuel rail quick disconnect o-rings. There have been reports of fires happening after the recall has been performed.|$|E

50|$|GM {{recalled}} 1.5 million {{vehicles with}} this engine on April 14, 2009 due to risk of fire from engine oil leaking under the valve <b>cover</b> <b>gaskets</b> onto hot exhaust manifolds. The fire could {{spread to the}} nearby plastic spark plug wire retainers on the valve cover {{and then to the}} rest of the engine compartment. GM fitted the affected vehicles with redesigned spark plug wire retainers. These engines were noted for having problems with the plastic upper intake manifold cracking around the EGR passage. The engine would then hydrolock. The lower intake gaskets and upper intake manifolds were revised, correcting all these issues.|$|R
40|$|The {{indigenous}} HRL {{will have}} option for upgrading its cooling capacity upto ~ 2 kW at ~ 4. 5 K. The cold box containing all cold equipment is designed considering strength and thermal aspects. Component layout inside the chamber is decided {{to maintain a}} temperature gradient through {{the length of the}} chamber. So, the chamber can be thought of two chambers; one 4 K part and another 20 K part. Stiffening rings, <b>covers,</b> <b>gasket</b> and saddle supports are designed. Strength analysis of the cold box is done in ANSYS. Piping and flexibility analysis is done in CAEPIPE. Support structures for all components are designed for permissible heat conduction as per HRL requirement. Entire cold box with its components is modeled in CATIA...|$|R
50|$|A gasket (rocker <b>cover</b> <b>gasket,</b> or valve <b>cover</b> <b>gasket</b> in the US and Canada) helps {{seal the}} joint between the rocker cover {{and the rest}} of the engine. Failure of this gasket can cause oil to leak from the engine.|$|E

5000|$|Ford {{experienced}} {{problems with}} this engine for the 1997 and 1998 model years. These included issuing all 1997-1998 engines made at the Essex Canadian plant with a bad front <b>cover</b> <b>gasket.</b> The lower-intake manifold had a bad reputation for cracking at relatively low miles. Ford resolved this problem by using a thicker gasket for 1999 model year, and 5 years later in 2004, it was modified again with a redesigned gasket that later became [...] "industrial" [...] certified as ESG-642 for Ford Power Products. It {{also served as a}} new and improved base engine for 2005+ F-150 regular-cab.|$|E
50|$|Oil leakage was {{commonplace in}} {{the first few years of}} production, though the problem was {{eventually}} addressed by aftermarket cam <b>cover</b> <b>gaskets</b> made from reusable rubber. Later 900 series Lotus engines included a revised cam tower that greatly improved the cam cover sealing design. The later cam towers can be retrofitted to the earlier 907 engines. Early Jensen-Healey engines (1972-1973) had oil supply issues that made the oil pressure slow to build on start-up. Some early engines also had issues with oil drainage which resulted in too much oil being retained in the cam carriers. Differences between early and late 907 engines included rope seals for the rear of the crankshaft versus regular spring-loaded rubber lip seals for the rear of the crankshaft on later 907 engines.|$|R

Individual mechanisms were mounted onto thick aluminum-alloy plates, and along with interconnecting shafts, were progressively installed into the housing. Progressive assembly meant that future access to much of the computer required progressive disassembly.|$|R

40|$|Accumulators are {{important}} components {{used in many}} systems at commercial boiling water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized water reactors in the United States. The accumulators are vessels attached to fluid systems to provide 1) a limited backup source of stored fluid energy for hydraulic/pneumatic mechanical equipment, 2) a damping effect on pressure pulses in fluid systems, and 3) a volume of fluid to be injected passively into a fluid system. Accumulators contain a gas that is compressed or expanded as the fluid from the system enters or exits the accumulator. The gas and fluid in accumulators are usually separated from each other by a piston or bladder. In support of the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Nuclear Aging Research Program (NPAR), the Pacific Northwest Laboratory conducted an analysis of available industry databases to determine if accumulator components already had been studied in other NPAR assessments and to evaluate each accumulator type for applicable aging issues. The results of this preliminary study indicate that two critical uses of accumulators have been previously evaluated by the NPAR program. NUREGICR- 5699, Aging and Service Wear of Control Rod Drive Mechanisms for BUT Nuclear Plants (Greene 199 I), identified two hydraulic control unit components subject to aging failures: accumulator nitrogen-charging cartridge valves and the scram water accumulator. In addition, NUREGICR- 6001, Aging Assessment of BWR Standby Liquid Control Systems (Buckley et al. 1992), identified two predominant aging-related accumulator failures that result {{in a loss of}} the nitrogen blanket pressure: (charging) valve wear and failure of the gas bladder. The present study has identified five prevalent aging-related accumulator failures: rupture of the accumulator bladder separation of the metal disc {{from the bottom of the}} bladder leakage of the gas from the charging valve leakage past the safety injection tank manway <b>cover</b> <b>gasket</b> leakage past O-rings. An additional study of the accumulator subcomponents associated with these failures is recommended, including an evaluation of current inspection programs to verify that they are detecting the aging degradation effects. The study may also provide beneficial input to the design of passive accumulator applications in advanced reactor designs...|$|E
40|$|Over the centuries, {{rubber latex}} gained its {{popularity}} in machinery application {{due to its}} unique thermal properties, high elasticity and excellent impact resistance. It is widely accepted in food industry as rubber has good resistance to chemicals, including acids, alkalis and salts. For instance, rubber components comprise of couplings, shields, dust <b>covers,</b> <b>gaskets</b> and seals exist as group or standalone component in food manufacturing equipments or machinery. Even {{though most of the}} rubber based products in food industry fulfil the requirements of Food and Drug Administration (FDA), however, the presence of trace amount of chemicals upon the preceding processing of rubber might accidentally contaminate to the food products. The contamination that happened might caused changes in food quality in term of taste, smell or even visual appearance. Therefore, this paper aims to review some of the manufacturing process of natural rubber products and to understand the possibility of extractable and leachable contaminated food products. An overview of potential toxicological problems will be discussed and the finding will be summarized in this paper...|$|R
25|$|The {{difference}} between the hermetic and semi-hermetic, is that the hermetic uses a one-piece welded steel casing that cannot be opened for repair; if the hermetic fails it is simply replaced with an entire new unit. A semi-hermetic uses a large cast metal shell with <b>gasketed</b> <b>covers</b> that can be opened to replace motor and pump components.|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} the present study is to {{evaluate}} the structural response and performance in a free drop test condition of a new Italian packaging system that should be used for the transportation of low and intermediate level radioactive wastes. For this purpose the carried out numerical analyses are presented and discussed. The numerical analyses, performed by the finite element MARCÂ® code, simulate the behaviour of the packaging system components: the overpack, <b>gasket,</b> <b>cover</b> lid, bolts and a concrete matrix representative of the radioactive content. The obtained results for 1. 2 m horizontal drop, on a flat and unyielding surface, were critically analysed and also compared to the experimental ones obtained from the experimental test campaign performed at the Unipi test facility on the new Italian packaging system considered. The stress and acceleration values indicate that the package, although rather local deformations in correspondence of bolts and secondary lid, is capable to withstand the dynamic loading generated during the drop test without any unacceptable loss of the safety features...|$|R
40|$|The {{water loss}} is a {{phenomenon}} frequently observed within water distribution systems. A considerable part of water losses occurs either because of the incorrect assembly of joints or because of the fatigue and ageing of the material used to ensure a watertight seal. Moreover, such a leakage {{is very difficult to}} detect and to assess. In this work, we present a novel formulation for modelling the pressure effect on the background leakage through the joints. The proposed approach is based on the preliminary evaluation of the enlargement i i, due to pressure, of the existing space between the outer side of the spigot end of a pipe and the inner wall of the hub end of the adjacent pipe (which is characterised by the area Ï‰atm at atmospheric pressure). Furthermore, the whole procedure is based on the evaluation, by field data or calibration, of a parameter i representing the rate of enlarged area Ï‰ that, for several reasons, may be not <b>covered</b> by the <b>gasket,</b> Ï‰ being the value, at pressure p, of the area above defined...|$|R
