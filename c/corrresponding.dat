40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} a stable measure space, which is a triple (X,,μ) consisting of a stable space of functions X on a probability space (Ω,,P), a stable collection of conditional subsets of X forming a Boolean σ-algebra with respect to the conditional set operations, and a stable σ-additive set function μ→L̅^ 0 _+, where L̅^ 0 _+ denotes the set of all measurable functions xΩ→R_+. We develop basic results of a measure theory for stable measure spaces. A suitable version of Carathéodory's extension theorem, Fubini's theorem, the Radon-Nikodým theorem and Daniell-Stone and Riesz type representation results are established. As applications, given a measurable space (E,E), we show that every kernel κΩ×E→R_+ can be extended to a stable measure. Moreover, for a sub-σ-algebra ⊆, the -conditional distribution of a random variable ξΩ→ E can be uniquely represented by a -stable probability measure. If (E,E) is a standard Borel space, every stable probability measure also uniquely <b>corrresponds</b> to a probability kernel.

In this paper we consider initially the situation where X is a semisimple variety associated with the semisimple monoid M. The factorial hull of such X is determined by a certain arrangement H of hyperplanes in the space of rational characters X(T) ⊗Q of a maximal torus T of G 0.

40|$|Chromatin {{condensation}} is {{a typical}} feature of sperm cells. During mammalian spermiogenesis, histones are first replaced by transition proteins and then by protamines, while little is known for Drosophila. Here I characterize three male specific genes in the fly genome, Mst 35 Ba, Mst 35 Bb and Mst 77 F. With eGFP fusion for these above mentioned proteins, I show here that Mst 35 Ba and Mst 35 Bb indeed encode for dProtA (Drosophila ProtamineA) and dProtB (Drosophila ProtamineB), respectively and show 94 % identity to each other. Drosophila protamines are considerably larger than mammalian protamines, but, as in mammals, both protamines contain typical cysteine/arginine clusters. Ectopic expression of both dProtA and dProtB in the salivary gland cells localizes to the nucleus. Both the protamines binds to the polytene chromosomes without any specificity for the euchromatin or the heterochromatin reflecting the binding status of protamines in sperm nucleus. Unlike in mammals, Drosophila protamine genes are not haplo insufficient. Screening of Zuker mutant collection did not show any mutation in both protamine genes, which argues for functional redundancy. Mst 77 F encode a spermatid specific linker histone-like protein. The expression pattern of Mst 77 F overlaps the pattern of protamines as a chromatin component. Mst 77 F shows significant similarity to mammalian HILS 1 protein. The ProtamineA-eGFP, ProtamineB-eGFP and Mst 77 F-eGFP carrying Drosophila lines show that these proteins become the important chromosomal protein components at the canoe stage in elongating spermatids and stays in mature sperm nucleus and His 2 AvDGFP vanishes at the canoe stage. Thus, transition from histone based nucleosomal configuration to protamine based chromatin configuration {{takes place at the}} canoe stage of spermatid development. Mst 77 F mutants (ms(3) nc 3) are characterized by small round nuclei and are male sterile. These data suggests, the major feature of chromatin condensation in Drosophila spermatogenesis <b>corrrespond</b> to those in mammals. During the canoe stage of spermatid development, histone H 2 AvD is degraded. Here I show a novel function of UbcD 1 an E 2 -ubiquitin conjugating enzyme that is required for H 2 AvD degradation. E 3 ligase Cullin- 1 and Cullin- 3 both are expressed during Drosophila spermatogenesis. Cullin- 1 is expressed in all early germ cells and localizes to the fusomes and degraded during meiosis. In the later stages, Cullin- 1 is expressed again and localizes to the perinuclear space at the canoe stage of spermatid differentiation. Cullin- 3 is expressed in the elongated spermatids. During early fertilization steps, the paternal pronucleus still contains protamines and Mst 77 F, but regains a nucleosomal conformation before zygote formation. In eggs laid by sesame mutant females, the paternal pronucleus remains in a protamine-based chromatin status, but Mst 77 F-eGFP is removed, suggesting that the sesame gene product (HIRA) is essential for removal of protamines while Mst 77 F removal is independent of Sesame...|$|R

As expected, lidocaine flux in the absence of an enhancer, increased from pH 5 to 9 with a <b>corrresponding</b> increase in the level of the unionized base. However, when skin was pretreated with 2 % laureate in Transcutol (2 % L-TC), drug permeation was higher at pH 5. 0 and 7. 0 than at 9. 0. A different trend was observed in experiments with 2 % oleate in Transcutol (2 % O-TC), where skin flux was maximal at a more basic pH, when the degree of ionization is low. The results suggest that sucrose laureate enhances the penetration of the ionized form of the drug (12 -fold greater flux relative to control), whereas sucrose oleate is more effective in promoting permeation of the unionized species. The structural properties of the sucrose esters as well as the degree of ionization of the drug are important characteristics affecting the transdermal flux of lidocaine...|$|E
