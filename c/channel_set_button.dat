Consumers can find {{a number of ways}} to cut back on their electrical use, especially with appliances commonly found in the home. Any economy that wants to advance must therefore embrace time management and proper conservation of electrical power supply. This can be achieved through limiting wastage in the limited power supply.

40|$|Abstract—Rendezvous is a {{necessary}} operation for cognitive users to establish communication links in cognitive radio net-works (CRNs). To guarantee the rendezvous in finite time, all existing rendezvous algorithms generate CH (channel-hopping) sequences using the whole <b>channel</b> <b>set</b> and attempt rendezvous {{on each of the}} channels (i. e., both available channels and unavailable channels). In practice, the available <b>channel</b> <b>set</b> is usually {{a small portion of the}} whole <b>channel</b> <b>set</b> due to dynamics of channel availabilities and limited sensing capabilities of cognitive users. Thus, the CH sequences using the whole <b>channel</b> <b>set</b> may attempt unnecessary rendezvous in uncertain channels (e. g., unavailable channels or randomly-selected channels) which greatly degrades the performance. In this study, we propose a new rendezvous algorithm that generates channel-hopping sequences based on available <b>channel</b> <b>set</b> (CSAC) for more efficient rendezvous. We prove that CSAC gives guaranteed rendezvous and derive its upper-bound on maximum time-to-rendezvous (MTTR) which is an expression of the number of available channels instead of the number of all potential channels. To the best of our knowledge, CSAC is the first one in the literature that exploits the only available channels in designing CH sequences while providing guaranteed rendezvous. Experimental results show that CSAC can significantly improve the MTTR compared to state-of-the-art. Index Terms—cognitive radio; rendezvous; channel hopping. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel analysis of cochannel reuse in Dynamic Channel Assignment (DCA) microcellular systems with an in [...] cell channel reuse constraint. Mathematical analysis {{is used to}} show that DCA systems exhibit significantly closer cochannel reuse than Fixed Channel Assignment (FCA) systems despite the reuse constraint. Closed form expressions for the cochannel reuse ratio (CRR) distributions in DCA microcell systems are derived. It is shown that the DCA reuse distributions cannot be obtained using conventional cellular engineering techniques, and are a fundamental consequence of the microcell architecture. 1 INTRODUCTION In conventional cellular radio communications systems (`macrocell' systems), the available radio channels are partitioned into C <b>channel</b> <b>sets</b> (C is called the `cluster size') and each transmitter is allocated the use {{of one of these}} <b>channel</b> <b>sets</b> [1].

40|$|Abstract. Recently a {{class of}} {{scalable}} multi-star optical networks is proposed. In this network class nodes are grouped into clusters.

One important issue for this network class is the conflict-free <b>channel</b> <b>set</b> assignment that maximizes spatial re-use of channels.

30|$|In this paper, we {{presented}} a proactive channel access MAC for {{an ad hoc}} CR network having a REM for initial setup and showed how this MAC {{can be used to}} keep the interference experienced by the PUs at a low level while providing better throughput for the SUs. The novel feature of this research was the incorporation of the SU statistics when selecting a <b>channel</b> <b>set</b> to be used. Furthermore, we introduced a SH CCC and derived the theoretical properties of it. This CCC used PU channel access probabilities when selecting the hopping pattern in the control phase. Then, in the data transmission phase, we used a prediction scheme called the PST which has a very low training and memory complexity. We tested our scheme in a scenario with a MAP-based channel state distribution with different channel utilization levels with imperfect sensing and showed that the impact of the <b>channel</b> <b>set</b> selection method has on the throughput and interference to the PUs. In the simulations, our <b>channel</b> <b>set</b> selection scheme had better probability of successful transmission than the random <b>channel</b> <b>set</b> selection scheme and the scheme based only on PU statistics at high SU traffic scenarios while having a PU interference probability less than 0.005. So when considering all of these factors, we can conclude that our MAC scheme is candidate worthy of consideration in proactive channel access in an ad hoc setting similar to the one the schemes we tested on.|$|R
