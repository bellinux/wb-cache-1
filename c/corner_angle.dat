50|$|Within the θ-β-M equation, {{a maximum}} <b>corner</b> <b>angle,</b> θMAX, exists for any {{upstream}} Mach number. When θ > θMAX, the oblique shock wave {{is no longer}} attached to the corner and {{is replaced by a}} detached bow shock. A θ-β-M diagram, common in most compressible flow textbooks, shows a series of curves that will indicate θMAX for each Mach number. The θ-β-M relationship will produce two β angles for a given θ and M1, with the larger angle called a strong shock and the smaller called a weak shock. The weak shock is almost always seen experimentally.|$|E

50|$|For a given Mach number, M1, and <b>corner</b> <b>angle,</b> θ, the oblique shock angle, β, and the {{downstream}} Mach number, M2, can be calculated. Unlike after {{a normal}} shock where M2 {{must always be}} less than 1, in oblique shock M2 can be supersonic (weak shock wave) or subsonic (strong shock wave). Weak solutions are often observed in flow geometries open to atmosphere (such as {{on the outside of}} a flight vehicle). Strong solutions may be observed in confined geometries (such as inside a nozzle intake). Strong solutions are required when the flow needs to match the downstream high pressure condition. Discontinuous changes also occur in the pressure, density and temperature, which all rise downstream of the oblique shock wave.|$|E

50|$|In 1504, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, {{the future}} Pope Paul III, {{acquired}} the estate at Caprarola. He had designs {{made for a}} fortified castle or rocca by the architects Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and Baldassare Peruzzi. Surviving plan drawings by Peruzzi show a pentagonal arrangement with each face of the pentagon canted inwards towards its center, to permit raking fire upon a would-be scaling force, both from the center and from the projecting bastions that advance from each <b>corner</b> <b>angle</b> of the fortress. Peruzzi's plan also shows a central pentagonal courtyard {{and it is likely}} that the later development of the circular central court was also determined by the necessities of the pentagonal plan. The pentagonal fortress foundations, constructed probably between 1515 and 1530, became the base upon which the present villa sits; so the overall form of the villa was predetermined by the rocca foundations.|$|E

Equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) is one kind of severe plastic deformation method to make ultrafine-grained metals. The ECAP processes are simulated by finite element method (FEM) in this work. The effects of inner <b>corner</b> <b>angle</b> on strain distribution during the deformation process are numerically analyzed. The evolutions of effective strain on three points of different deformation are compared. The {{results show that the}} deformation becomes severe on each point when the inner <b>corner</b> <b>angle</b> is less than 90 o, which is different from the situation when the inner <b>corner</b> <b>angle</b> is equal to or greater than 90 o. The results are useful for improving the ECAP process to make the structure of metals homogenous. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>corner</b> <b>angle</b> {{variations}} on pressure drop and heat transfer characteristics is investigated in the fully developed region of wavy ducts with trapezoidal cross-sections.

Numerical simulations show that Nusselt numbers and friction factors increase with the decrease of <b>corner</b> <b>angle</b> from 90 to 60 degrees, before levelling out around 60 degrees. Nusselt numbers and friction factors also increase with the Reynolds number, and the slopes of their representative curves increase above a critical value of the Reynolds number because of the onset of time-periodic flow oscillations.

On the basis of experimental data and calculations we demonstrate that such systems as the asymmetric Helium trimer $^ 3 $He$^ 4 $He$_ 2 $ and the halo nucleus $^{ 22 }$C exhibit universal features.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from the}} publisher via the DOI in this record. The two-dimensional, semi-infinite symmetrical head with gap <b>corner</b> <b>angle</b> {{and in the absence of}} a soft underlayer was postulated in the early history of magnetic recording to develop the field theory necessary for modeling and understanding the record and readout processes. Practical and mathematical considerations limited the theory of this general head structure to corner angles= 90 ° (right-angled head) and= 0 ° ("thin" gap head). Thus explicit and analytical solutions for the gap potential function and its Fourier transform (necessary for determining the fields beyond the head surface) as functions of <b>corner</b> <b>angle</b> for symmetrical heads remain unavailable. Moreover, saturation in the gap corners associated with reduction of the gap <b>corner</b> <b>angle</b> is not well understood and characterised. In this article, the scalar magnetic potential of a single 2 -D corner is derived exactly, and superposition of two corner potentials was then used to derive an approximate analytical expression for the gap potential function of 2 -D symmetrical heads with arbitrary <b>corner</b> <b>angle.</b> The derived expressions for the potentials and fields were in excellent agreement with exact analytical solutions and with finite-element solutions for all≤ 90 °. The derived expressions were also shown to predict accurately the surface potentials of other symmetrical head structures including the tilted pole head, the parallel plate head and the tilted plate head. An analytical approximation for the Fourier transform of the surface field for the 2 -D symmetrical head was derived, showing the shift in the spectral gap nulls towards longer wavelengths with reducing gap <b>corner</b> <b>angle.</b> Systematic finite-element calculations of the static vector potential for the 2 -D symmetrical head were carried out using a nonlinear B-H core material model for different driving fields and corner angles. Corner saturation was characterised by the driving fields that yield 10 % root-mean-square deviation from the linear material response. The simulations correctly predicted the known saturation driving field/ 2 for right-angle heads (is the core saturation magnetisation), and revealed a generalisation for all≤ 90 ° in the form of the exponential dependence exp(), where the free parameters and were determined from fitting to the finite-element simulations for both field maxima and their gradients...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{were carried}} out to investigate gyres within open lacustrine embayments subjected to parallel-to-shore currents. In such embayments, gyre formation occurs due to flow separation at the embayment’s upstream edge. High momentum fluid from the mixing layer between the embayment and offshore flows into the embayment and produces recirculating flow. Systematic numerical experiments using different synthetic embayment configurations were {{used to examine the}} impact of embayment geometry. Geometries included embayments with different aspect ratios, depths and embayment <b>corner</b> <b>angles.</b> The magnitudes of the recirculation and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) in the embayment vary significantly for angles in the range 40 °– 55 °. Embayments with <b>corner</b> <b>angles</b> less than 50 ° have much stronger recirculation and TKE, other parameters remaining the same. The numerical findings are consistent with gyre formation observed in two embayments located in Lake Geneva, Switzerland, and thus help explain flow patterns recorded in lacustrine shoreline regions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Vasarely's `nested-squares ' {{illusion}} {{shows that}} 908 corners {{can be more}} salient perceptually than straight edges. On {{the basis of this}} illusion we have developed a novel visual illusion, the Àlternating Brightness Star', which shows that sharp corners are more salient than shallow corners (an effect we call `corner angle salience variation') and that the same corner can be perceived as either bright or dark depending on the polarity of the angle (ie whether concave or convex: `corner angle brightness reversal'). Here we quantify the perception of <b>corner</b> <b>angle</b> salience variation and <b>corner</b> <b>angle</b> brightness reversal effects in twelve naive human subjects, in a two-alternative forced-choice brightness discrimination task. The results show that sharp corners generate stronger percepts than shallow corners, and that corner gradients appear bright or dark depending on whether the corner is concave or convex.
