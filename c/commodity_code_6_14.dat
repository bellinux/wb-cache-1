Central to this analysis is the automated classification of these transactions to hierarchical <b>commodity</b> <b>coding</b> systems. Spend classification is challenging due {{not only to the}} complexities of the <b>commodity</b> <b>coding</b> systems but also because of the sparseness and quality of each individual transaction text description and the volume of such transactions in an organization. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of off-the-shelf machine learning tools to address the challenges in spend classification. We have built a system using off-the-shelf SVM, Logistic Regression, and language processing toolkits and describe the effectiveness of these different learning techniques for spend classification. ...|$|R

In the empirical research the eight-digit <b>commodity</b> <b>codes</b> CN 8 were used as well as HS 2 codes that allow grouping imported commodities covered by anti-dumping proceedings by their manufacturing divisions. In that way a determined classification of commodities was used to describe a comparative advantage. To conduct assessment the modified Ballasa index (Bi) and Grupp/Legler index were used.
