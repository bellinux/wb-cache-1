5|$|On October 27 {{the company}} began buying back all its <b>commercial</b> <b>paper,</b> valued at around $3.3 billion, {{in an effort to}} calm {{investor}} fears about Enron's supply of cash. Enron financed the re-purchase by depleting its lines of credit at several banks. While the company's debt rating was still considered investment-grade, its bonds were trading at levels slightly less, making future sales problematic.|$|E

Moody's also warned that it would downgrade Enron's <b>commercial</b> <b>paper</b> rating, the consequence of which would likely prevent the company from finding the further financing it sought to keep solvent.|$|E

25|$|On October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve further {{expanded}} the collateral it will loan against to include <b>commercial</b> <b>paper</b> {{using the new}} <b>Commercial</b> <b>Paper</b> Funding Facility (CPFF). The action made the Fed a crucial source of credit for non-financial businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms. Fed officials said they'll buy {{as much of the}} debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They refused to say how much that might be, but they noted that around $1.3 trillion worth of <b>commercial</b> <b>paper</b> would qualify. There was $1.61 trillion in outstanding <b>commercial</b> <b>paper,</b> seasonally adjusted, on the market as of October 1, 2008, {{according to the most recent}} data from the Fed.
