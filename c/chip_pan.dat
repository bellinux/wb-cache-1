5|$|Deep frying (also {{referred}} to as deep fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used in conventional frying, done in a frying pan. Normally, a deep fryer or <b>chip</b> <b>pan</b> is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has {{a high rate of}} heat conduction.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{suspicious}} {{to begin}} with, Dot accepted them both into her home, believing that Nick truly had changed this time. Asked whether Nick {{really was a}} reformed character, Altman remained ambiguous: [...] "Nick's back, he's got a cute little daughter. He's become a plumber, he's a changed man. ...Or is he?" [...] As the storyline progressed, Nick's true agenda was revealed when he blackmailed his mother into giving him money for custody of Dotty. A BBC source reportedly told The Sun, [...] " [...] horrified when Nick tells her Dotty is for sale. He shows no emotion and his evil grin sends shivers down her spine. She always knew Nick would sell his soul {{for the price of}} some pick ’n mix but she had no idea he’d sell his own daughter." [...] In a further plot twist, it was revealed to the audience in 2009, that Dotty (real name Kirsty) was colluding with her father all along. In the storyline, Dotty suggested killing Dot for her life assurance policy. Nick leaves following this, allowing Dotty to work on Dot and he returns three months later where they begin their plan to convince Dot and her friends that she is suffering with dementia; Nick's aim being to kill Dot and blame her death on her deteriorating mental state. During Nick's brief stay in the square, he overheard Billy Mitchell telling Dot how he let Jase Dyer die and Nick blackmailed Billy by demanding regular payments or he would tell Jase's son Jay what Billy did. When Billy's cousin, Phil, found out about this, he led Nick into the barrel store of The Queen Vic, where he beats him up and ties him to a chair. Phil gave Billy the opportunity to scare Nick off and end this, however, Billy let him go and told Jay the truth himself. The plot with his own daughter to kill his beloved mother climaxes on-screen in June 2009: Nick's plan goes awry after Dotty has a change of heart and ultimately rescues her grandmother from being poisoned, instead drugging Nick. This leads to a series of events whereby Nick, in a bid to escape once his plan has been exposed, holds various members of the community hostage in the café and an accidental fire is started after Heather Trott pushes Nick into the <b>chip</b> <b>pan.</b> The hostages manage to escape due to a fight between Nick and Ryan Malloy, {{who was one of the}} hostages. This results in an explosion at the café with Nick and Bradley Branning inside. The storyline marked Altman's departure from the show once again. His departing episode was scripted as a cliffhanger, as it was not revealed whether Nick had survived the explosion at the end of the episode. However, in the following episode, on 4 June 2009, Nick is shown to survive the explosion and Bradley is hospitalised with injuries to his eye. Nick departs after once again being disowned by Dot. Dotty is left in Dot's care despite Nick explaining to his mother that Dotty is evil.|$|E

40|$|The {{best way}} to {{extend the life of}} a {{metalworking}} fluid (MWF) is to make sure the machine tool and MWF delivery system are properly cleaned at least once per year. The dilemma the MWF manager is faced with is: How does one clean the machine tool and the MWF system on a large machine tool with an enclosure in a timely manner without impacting production schedules? Remember the walls and roof of the machine enclosure are coated with a film of dried contaminated MWF that must also be removed. If not removed, the deposits on these surfaces can recontaminate the fresh charge of MWF. I have found a product that with this revised procedure helps to shorten the machine tool down time involved with machine cleaning. (1) Discuss with your MWF supplier if they have a machine cleaning product that can be used with your current water based MWF during normal machining operations. Most MWF manufacturers have a machine cleaner that can be used at a lower concentration (1 - 2 % vs. 5 %) and can be used while still making production parts {{for a short period of}} time (usually 24 - 48 hours). (2) Make sure this machine cleaner is compatible with the work-piece material you are machining into product. Most cleaners are compatible with ferrous alloys. Because of the increased alkalinity of the fluid you might experience staining if you are machining copper or aluminum alloys. (3) Remove the chips from the <b>chips</b> <b>pans</b> and fluid channels. (4) During off shift hours circulate the MWF using a new product marketed by Rego-Fix called a 'Hydroball'. This device has a 5 / 8 inch diameter straight shank which allows it to be installed in any collet or solid quick change tool holder. It has multiple nozzles so that the user can control the spray pattern generated when the MWF is circulated. It allows the user to utilize the high pressure, through spindle MWF delivery capability of your machine tool for cleaning purposes. The high pressure MWF system can now be effectively used for cleaning purposes. This will also work with standard pressure system but you must reduce the number of nozzles utilized. By combining the movement of the machine axis around the operating envelope and the MWF circulation you can do a reasonably effective job of washing the inside of the machine tool operating cavity. Way covers will be moved and surfaces exposed because of axis movement. Spray direction will change to better wash fixtures and machine tool components. Deposits will start to breakdown and be washed into the machine tool sump. Since the cycle will run four or more hours it can be done with a weaker cleaning solution. The distributor states that the unit can be rotated up to 50 RPM. When running it has the same effect as the washing rotor inside of your home dishwasher. Inside the cavity on a machining center there is a lot of splash. During normal operations, MWF deposits buildup on the walls and roof of the enclosures. If these deposits (containing bacteria, mold and other contaminants) are not removed they will inoculate the fresh charge of MWF when they are resaturated. When you clean the inside of machine tool cavity, time is spent removing these deposits on the walls and roof of the enclosure. Getting to these surfaces is very difficult usually requiring that a member of the cleaning crew get inside the machine tool to reach them. The Hydro ball is effective in distributing the cleaning solution on all surfaces of the enclosure under high pressure. The only negative we have found is you get to find all the gaps and leaks in your machine tool enclosure. By running the hydro ball with the machine cleaner enriched MWF during off shift (4 - 8 hours) you can effectively remove these deposits and buildups on the internal surfaces of the cavity of the machine tool and wash them down into the sump. You also clean the internal components of the MWF system without interrupting normal scheduled work. (5) Pump out the spent MWF. You will have found that most of the deposits have been washed from the internal surfaces of the enclosure. For extremely dirty machines you might have to refill the machine tool with the normal machine cleaner mix. You will find that even heavy deposits will break down quicker because of this pre-wash cycle. (6) Rinse the machine cavity. (7) Clean the walls, bottom and screens in the MWF reservoir. The use of this tool and the dilute machine cleaner reduced the cleaning time considerately without affecting production schedules. (8) Refill with MWF and resume normal operations. What we like about this system is we can schedule these light cleanings just before a scheduled fluid change. Add the cleaner to the mix and run the Hydroball on second shift. The spent fluid is pumped out on third shift and the machine refilled. The machine tool with a fresh charge of MWF is ready for first shift without interrupting production schedules. We get better life from our MWFs and the machinists are happier about the condition of their machines...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] The {{metalworker}} can {{be exposed}} to cutting oils during application by two basic routes of entry: skin contact and inhalation. The higher risk jobs tend to be those with high cutting speeds, heavy oil flow, and continuous contact, which may result in the worker being splashed with oil on the skin or clothing. The oil may remain on the skin {{for some time and}} oil-soaked clothing may be worn all shift. Cutting oils may be applied manually, by an air-carried mist, or by a continuous flood. When flooding is used, the oil is delivered by a pump, piping, and nozzle to the cutting zone. With this method the tool, work, and chip are flooded. (Used fluid is then collected in the <b>chip</b> <b>pan</b> and returned by gravity to the pump sump.) Inhalation of cutting oil mists may occur {{because of the nature of}} coolant delivery or because of the high temperatures and speeds generated at the cutting tool 2 ̆ 7 s working edge. When the mist stream method of coolant delivery is used, much of it evaporates on contact with the hot tool, workpiece or chip. In addition to the intentional production of oil mists, vaporized oil can also be generated by the forces of the rapidly spinning workpiece or tool, or by the vaporization of the fluid from the heat of the cutting process...|$|E
