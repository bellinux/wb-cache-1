25|$|The CB400A has a {{two-speed}} semi-automatic transmission. It has a {{torque converter}} and two forward gears (high and low) {{that have to}} be manually selected by the rider. There is a gear position indicator in lieu of a tachometer in the instrument binnacle. A parking brake replaced the <b>clutch</b> <b>lever.</b> This model has 28mm Keihin carburettors which lower the peak power in exchange for low-down response.|$|E
25|$|The Ninja 300 {{is based}} on the Ninja 250R, a {{lightweight}} and inexpensive sport bike in production for over three decades. Like the Ninja 250R, it has a full fairing, but a wider rear tire, 140/70, than the instead of 130/70 on the 250R. The Ninja 300 also has a LED tail lamp, 5 spoke wheels, neutral finder, and optional ABS.By comparison with the 250R, the Ninja 300 also has a slightly smaller fuel tank, taller gearing, and a back-torque-limiting slipper clutch with an assist mechanism that decreases <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> effort. Despite being a sport bike, it has comfortable ergonomics (such as windscreen effectively protecting from wind blast) which promotes commuting.|$|E

500|$|The {{sequential}} shifting three speed gearbox was manually shifted, but clutchless, {{without the}} need for a <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> control, using instead a centrifugal clutch along with a plate clutch slaved to the footchange lever to engage and disengage the gearbox from the engine. While not intuitive to learn, once the rider got used to it, the semi-automatic transmission, [...] "took the terror out of motorcycling" [...] for novice riders. Unlike many scooter CVTs, the centrifugal clutch made it possible to push start the Super Cub, a useful advantage if the need arose.|$|E

5000|$|The 620 has an APTC wet clutch. According to Ducati, the wet <b>clutch</b> reduces <b>lever</b> {{operating}} effort, ensuring gradual engagement, and {{incorporates a}} racing derived [...] "slipper" [...] device {{to reduce the}} tendency for the rear wheel to lock-up or chatter during aggressive downshifting.|$|R
5000|$|EX250-H - This model came to Canada as the Ninja 250R between 2000 and 2002, {{after which}} it {{received}} a new name: ZZR-250, {{in line with}} the -H model's name elsewhere in the world, where it had existed since 1992. This motorcycle has parts in common with the -F model, though it shares the same engine, albeit with different casings. It sports a lateral aluminum frame, a different fairing (designed to make it look sportier), larger 17-inch wheels, an adjustable rear shock absorber, adjustable brake and <b>clutch</b> <b>levers,</b> a smaller drive sprocket, computer-controlled timing advance, and a revised electrical system. It also had a smaller carburetor, & slightly different compression ratio, both of which were designed for quicker revving and slightly higher top end power. However, these upgrades came at a 6 kg weight gain.|$|R
50|$|The Powerplus had twist grips on both handles; the {{throttle}} {{was controlled by}} the left twist grip while the right twist grip advanced or retarded the spark. Three controls were {{on the right side}} of the gas tank, a vertically-operated shifter, an exhaust valve lifter, and a hand <b>clutch</b> <b>lever.</b> The <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> was linked to the clutch pedal positioned on the left side of the bike.|$|E
50|$|Clutched Shifter - This shifter has a <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> on it {{allowing}} one-handed shifting. This design {{allows the}} left foot to be free.|$|E
50|$|By {{comparison}} with the 250R, the Ninja 300 also has a slightly smaller 17 L fuel tank, taller gearing, and a back-torque-limiting slipper clutch with an assist mechanism that decreases <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> effort.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the 1990s, supermoto bikes, {{including}} the precursor motorcycles used in Superbikers, were converted open-class two-stroke motocross or enduro bikes desired for their light weight and jumping abilities. The motorcycles currently used for Supermoto racing are predominantly single-cylinder four-stroke powered dirtbikes with 17 in, sometimes with 16.5 in front wheels. The 17 in wheels allow {{the use of}} up to 7.0 in superbike road racing slick tires. These are often hand-grooved on the rear tire to facilitate slightly better acceleration on the dirt stretches of a supermoto course. Suspension is lowered and slightly stiffened in comparison with a stock dirt bike, and braking power is improved with oversize front brake rotors and calipers. Despite the lack of trees on supermoto courses, hand guards are frequently added to supermoto bikes due the extreme cornering angles achieved by riders. Hand guards also greatly improve survivability of the brake & <b>clutch</b> <b>levers</b> during a fall making supermoto bikes highly crash resistant and often able to quickly re-enter the fray during a race following a crash.|$|R
6000|$|The {{aeronaut}} glanced, {{and then}} <b>clutched</b> at the <b>lever</b> to recover, {{for they were}} sweeping down. When the aeropile was rising again he {{drew a deep breath}} and replied. [...] "That," [...] and he indicated the white thing still fluttering down, [...] "was a swan." ...|$|R
5000|$|Two of {{the cars}} built used an early form of {{automatic}} transmission developed in Australia. This {{was described as a}} frictionless system of centrifugal control in which the torque was developed by balanced weights brought into action by planetary gears without need of a <b>clutch</b> or gear <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Panda has a 'grip-locking' <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> and a {{carburettor}} set-up {{that provides}} a very reliable and steady tick-over. The rear brake comprises a back pedal Perry Coaster hub and a conventional bicycle-type hub brake, handlebar lever operated for the front brake.|$|E
5000|$|A rider may be {{assisted}} by {{no more than}} four mechanics while changing bikes during a pit stop, all of whom must wear approved helmets. A mechanic may hold in the bike's <b>clutch</b> <b>lever,</b> but only the rider can select a gear.|$|E
50|$|Traditional scooters (such as the Vespa) {{still have}} manual {{gear-changing}} by a twist {{grip on the}} left hand side of the handlebar, with a co-rotated <b>clutch</b> <b>lever.</b> Modern scooters were often fitted with a throttle-controlled continuously variable transmission, thus earning the term twist-and-go.|$|E
50|$|In 1955 {{he decided}} that cars didn’t need a <b>clutch,</b> a gear <b>lever,</b> or brakes, {{and took out a}} {{provisional}} patent on what he described as his ‘Infinitely variable gear Box’. Motor engineers, who checked the plans, pronounced the invention foolproof and gave their opinion that it could be mass-produced quite cheaply.|$|R
50|$|The car {{featured}} {{an automatic}} clutch which was commonly {{described as a}} three-speed semi-automatic gearbox: there was no clutch pedal, but instead, touching the gear lever knob operated an internal electric switch that operated a vacuum system which disengaged the <b>clutch.</b> The gear <b>lever</b> itself then could be moved through a standard 'H pattern' gate.|$|R
50|$|The Fiat {{steel frame}} was {{modified}} to carry independent suspension with front torsion bar. At the rear, hydraulic drum brakes were placed {{next to the}} differential, attached to a frame also fitted with elastic suspension elements borrowed from a Gilera motorcycle, shock absorbers and a <b>clutch</b> system articulation <b>lever</b> adapted from a door closing device salvaged from a local pub.|$|R
5000|$|CT110s {{are well}} {{regarded}} for their extreme reliability, economy {{and ease of}} operation. The clutchless four speed transmission (centrifugal clutch) {{does not require a}} <b>clutch</b> <b>lever.</b> In Australia and New Zealand the freeing of the left hand of the rider makes mail delivery easier for postal workers, or [...] "posties".|$|E
50|$|The RC8 R {{offers many}} chassis {{adjustments}} not found on other superbikes. In {{addition to the}} suspension, the rider can adjust many other parts on the bike including the front brake lever, the rear brake pedal, the <b>clutch</b> <b>lever,</b> the handlebars, the shifter, the footpegs, and the seat/subframe height. Essentially, the adjustable options allow the RC8 R to accommodate riders of various sizes.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Hondamatic system noted above, Yamaha Motor Company introduced a semi-automatic transmission on its 2007 model year FJR1300 sport-touring motorcycle in 2006. Notably, this system can be shifted either with the lever in the traditional position near the left foot, or with a switch accessible to the left hand where the <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> would go on traditional motorcycles.|$|E
50|$|The Honda TR200 {{series of}} bikes was {{produced}} only in 1986 and 1987. The engine was a 199 cc four-stroke OHC single {{linked to a}} five-speed transmission and automatic <b>clutch.</b> It featured <b>lever</b> actuated drum brakes on both wheels. This bike was unique in that it used two ATV-type tires. Presently complete bikes are quite uncommon, though replacement parts are readily available as they interchange with other Honda ATCs.|$|R
50|$|Renthal also {{produces}} chains, sprockets and grips. The Intellilever unbreakable <b>clutch</b> and brake <b>levers</b> for motocross bikes along with brake pads were added in 2008. Also new is a hybrid bi-metal rear sprocket called the Twinring Rear Chainwheel which utilizes an aluminium centre section mated with a steel outer ring. By combining these two materials, the chainwheel is lighter than an all-steel construction but is more durable {{than the traditional}} all aluminium rear sprocket.|$|R
50|$|The German {{automobile}} manufacturer NSU {{produced an}} automated {{system for the}} rotary-engined NSU Ro 80 saloon car in the 1960s, similar in concept to VW's Automatic Stickshift: a three-speed manual gearbox with a vacuum operated dry clutch controlled by a contact in the gear lever, and a torque converter. There was no clutch pedal, but slightly moving the gearshift closed an electric switch that operated a vacuum system which disengaged the <b>clutch.</b> The gear <b>lever</b> itself then could be moved through a standard 'H pattern' gate.|$|R
50|$|Some 1950s-era James {{motorcycles}} {{were built}} using Villiers engines that utilized a preselector gearbox. Press the gear pedal down to select 1st gear, then pull in the <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> {{and on its}} return the gear engaged and drove forward, press the gear pedal again to select 2nd gear and it will engage only after the lever has been pulled in again.|$|E
50|$|The CB400A has a {{two-speed}} semi-automatic transmission. It has a {{torque converter}} and two forward gears (high and low) {{that have to}} be manually selected by the rider. There is a gear position indicator in lieu of a tachometer in the instrument binnacle. A parking brake replaced the <b>clutch</b> <b>lever.</b> This model has 28mm Keihin carburettors which lower the peak power in exchange for low-down response.|$|E
50|$|The layout {{consisted}} of a small, 18 ft lift hill, followed by a diving 180° turn and several small hills, ending with another 180° {{turn back to the}} station. High Speed Thrill Coaster lift was powered by a six-cylinder Ford engine. The operator could control the coaster's overall speed by adjusting the speed of the chain through a <b>clutch</b> <b>lever</b> to engage and disengage the engine from the lift chain.|$|E
50|$|In December 1901 {{the first}} 133 cc single-cylinder {{motorcycle}} was built, followed in 1903 by a shaft-driven 188 cc single-cylinder motorcycle.In 1904 a 300 cc single-cylinder motorcycle was produced. The 1907 single-cylinder 244 cc FN motorcycle {{was the first}} bike with a multiple-ratio belt drive system, using a patented variable-size engine pulley. In 1909 the two-speed singles had camshafts to open the inlets, instead of the earlier “automatic” valves. Starting from 1912 the singles had a hand <b>lever</b> <b>clutch</b> and foot pedal rear brake.|$|R
5000|$|Farwell {{had more}} ideas to offer. For 1908, a new Model 9 50 hp appeared. It seems {{this the first}} Adams-Farwell with a new and ingenious four speed transmission. Since most {{contemporary}} cars had three speeds, the new Adams-Farwell offered an ingenious construction consisting of the transmission, two <b>clutches,</b> a <b>lever</b> for each of them, and one handle to operate the <b>levers.</b> One <b>clutch</b> engaged gears 2 and 4, the other gears 1, 3, and reverse. So, two speeds could be [...] "preselected", but the one-handle operation prevented two speeds being engaged at the same time. Further, antiquated tiller steering {{was replaced by a}} wheel, and there was a pedal for acceleration. Therefore, the removable steering was no longer offered, but Adams-Farwells got a rail instead in which the column and pedal could be moved from the left to the right, allowing the driver to sit either at the left, the right or in the center. Model 9 came as 7-passenger touring, a 3-passenger coupé, and 3-passenger roadster, the latter replacing the Model 8-A, featuring normal chassis and body construction.|$|R
30|$|Driving {{tests were}} {{performed}} using a driving simulator, which {{had previously been}} constructed at Kanazawa University and validated in terms of usefulness as a simulator (Yamakoshi et al. 2009 b; Yamakoshi et al. 2009 a). The simulator consists of an adjustable car seat, steering wheel, gear <b>lever,</b> <b>clutch,</b> brake, and accelerator pedals for vehicle control. The system generates realistic monotonous roadway scenery, which is projected on a 1219 × 1626 -mm screen, placed 1.3 m {{in front of the}} midpoint between the driver’s eyes. The screen provided the driver with a 65 ° horizontal field of view. Auditory feedback is provided by speakers and includes engine sound. In addition, the road condition is transmitted through the steering wheel by mechanical vibration.|$|R
