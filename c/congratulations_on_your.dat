40|$|Dedicated to Professor Avner Friedman on the {{occasion}} of his 80 th birthday. <b>Congratulations,</b> Avner, <b>on</b> <b>your</b> far too many to mention accomplishments! Abstract. Keizer’s paradox refers to the observation that deterministic and stochastic descriptions of chemical reactions can predict vastly different long term outcomes. In this paper, we use slow manifold analysis to help resolve this paradox for four variants of a simple autocatalytic reaction. We also provide rigorous estimates of the spectral gap of important linear operators, which establishes parameter ranges in which the slow manifold analysis is appropriate. 1. Introduction. In 1987, Joel Keizer proposed a simple autocatalytic chemical reaction for which the deterministic ordinary differential equation model based on the law of mass action and the stochastic formulation, given by the chemical master equation, predict qualitatively different long term outcomes [6]. Such autocatalytic reactions occur, for example, in the misfolding of prion protein (PrP) in Creutzfeldt...|$|R

Little Primpton need not be ashamed now to hold up its head among the proudest cities of the Empire. You have brought honour to yourself, but you have brought honour to us also. You have shown that Englishmen know how to die; you have shown the rival nations of the Continent that the purity and the godliness of Old England still bear fruit. But I will say no more; I wished only to utter a few words to welcome you on behalf of those who cannot, perhaps, express themselves so well as I can. I will say no more. Captain Parsons, we hope that you will live long to enjoy your honour and glory, side by side with her who is to shortly become your wife. I would only assure you that your example has not been lost upon us; we all feel better, nobler, and more truly Christian. And we say to you, now that you have overcome all dangers and tribulation, now that you have returned to the bosom of your beloved family, take her who has also given us an example of resignation, of courage, and of--and of resignation. Take her, we say, and be happy; confident in the respect, esteem, and affection of the people of Little Primpton.
