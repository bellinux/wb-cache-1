40|$|For the {{decomposition}} of GDP into its trend and cyclical components, Blanchard and Quah (1989) proposed {{to extract the}} cycle by imposing a long-run restriction on the moving average polynomial of a bivariate autoregressive process for GDP and a <b>cyclical</b> <b>indicator.</b> We investigate the robustness of this decomposition {{with respect to the}} specification of the process and the choice of the <b>cyclical</b> <b>indicator.</b> We find that low order VARMA processes are sufficient for capturing the joint dynamics of the bivariate process. The decomposition seems rather stable, however, there are differences in the impulse response functions associated with permanent shocks. Moreover, the inflation rate, though used in several studies, seems not suitable for the usage as a <b>cyclical</b> <b>indicator.</b> ...|$|E

The first uses the <b>cyclical</b> <b>indicators</b> to adjust potential output estimates derived from a Hodrick-Prescott filter over the most recent period when such estimates are {{generally considered to be}} unreliable.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the business}} cycle properties of 183 time series relevant to the Italian economy, including real, monetary and international variables. We propose new monthly coincident and leading composite indicators for the Italian business cycle; the leading indicator anticipates the turning points of the coincident indicator on average by six months. On the methodological side, the study provides a scheme for constructing <b>cyclical</b> <b>indicators</b> on a sound statistical basis through iterative steps, combining the use of traditional NBER methods with that of more recent techniques of cyclical analysis. A number of stylized facts of the Italian business cycle emerge. Among them, money and financial variables are found to lead the cycle, chronologically, {{by an average of}} between one year and sixteen months. There is also strong evidence of synchronization of international cycles, with the US and UK cycles leading the Italian cycle by two to three quarters. The main linking channel seems to be trade, with Italian exports to EU countries leading the cycle by six months on average. business cycles, <b>cyclical</b> <b>indicators,</b> leading indicators, Italian stylized fact...|$|R

40|$|If {{the more}} or less {{regulate}} moves of the macroeconomic variables are accepted by the economists as a reality, the problem of measuring the aggregate level {{of the economy in}} direct correlation with these fluctuations is much more difficult due to the numerous variables involved. The way these variables move in time is very different from a period to another as well as from a country to another. While some variables have already reached their maximum level, others are on their descendent slope. This is the reason why the measurement problem of the aggregate level of the macroeconomic activity deserves our attention. Finding the patterns macroeconomic variables move together and influence each other is important both as a theoretical challenge, but for its practical utility as well. Depending on the result of the measurement process, the authorities are able to conduct their economic policies. More precisely, the monetary or fiscal authority will act differently if the economy is in recession or in expansion. These are the reasons for which a very important phase {{in the study of the}} cycle is its descriptive analysis, which is realized by focusing on certain aspects, such as: the length and magnitude, the correlation of the economic variables with the reference series, the study of the <b>cyclical</b> <b>indicators,</b> the analysis of the relative variability of economic series, the diagnose and prevision based on the <b>cyclical</b> <b>indicators...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} new methodological {{approach}} to the identification and extraction of an index of the business cycle. The main difference with the previous literature is that the reference cycle is identified as the common transitory component of a multivariate time series, and it is estimated using a structural multivariate approach. The empirical analysis shows that the proposed index substantially replicates the official reference cycle by employing a stochastic model that is both parsimonious and statistically satisfactory. 1. Introduction The recent work by Stock and Watson (1989, 1991) has reopened the debate about which is the appropriate indicator of the business cycle. Their methodological suggestion is to adopt a probabilistic approach, that sets out explicitly the statistical model upon which the <b>cyclical</b> <b>indicator</b> is based, thereby allowing a formal evaluation of its properties. The identification of a probability model of the business cycle requires a precise and coher [...] ...|$|E

The findings of the thesis are then reconciled with other theoretical and empirical literature in the field.

The effects of the explanatory variables lagged six years are consistent with the model. Military conscription with educational exemptions and the Vietnam War increased male PhD production in the U. S., but have no effect for U. S. females or in Canada. Government expenditures on research and development enhanced PhD production, especially for males and in the physical sciences in the U. S. A higher rate of growth of non-farm productivity encouraged PhD production in the U. S., but not in Canada. The <b>cyclical</b> <b>indicator,</b> the adult male unemployment rate, has a weak positive effect for males in both the U.

In order to assess the reliability of an output gap estimate two criteria are adopted. Firstly, the estimate should have forecasting power over inflation. Secondly, the ex post statistical revisions of the output gap should not differ significantly from previously computed measures. As an additional check on reliability, we {{find out whether the}} estimate of the output gap is positively correlated with standard measures of capacity utilization. We find that under our multivariate specification, unobservable components (UC) type models of the output gap show temporal consistency between sequential and final estimates and are consistent with known <b>cyclical</b> <b>indicators.</b> On the other hand, our UC models for the output gap have limited forecasting power for inflation, since they underperform an arbitrary autoregressive model.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to empirically {{investigate}} the cyclical features of the main Italian Manufacturing Business Survey indicators using time and frequency domain techniques. In particular, it analyzes the dynamics of each survey variable over time and with respect to different benchmark business cycles. The findings show that important changes have occurred in the periodicity and volatility of Manufacturing Survey data over the years. As expected, the contemporary cross-correlation of each Survey indicator is higher with respect to the industrial production than it is to the GDP cyclical component. Evidence of significant differences in the co-movements between each indicator with respect to GDP and industrial production is found. The cross-spectral analysis seems to reveal the existence of a common periodicity of all <b>cyclical</b> <b>indicators</b> with both the manufacturing and the whole-economy business cycle.
