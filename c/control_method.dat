5|$|Critics {{thought the}} {{enhancements}} {{made to the}} gamepad control scheme were smart and welcomed additions like controls groups. However, in some cases reviewers still regarded the gamepad as a suboptimal <b>control</b> <b>method,</b> {{largely due to the}} nature of analog sticks being imprecise in comparison to a mouse. This led to some frustration among several writers as they were unable to avoid enemy attacks because maneuvering units was slow with a gamepad. While the mouse and keyboard controls were seen as superior for performing precise actions quickly, some reviewers considered the <b>control</b> <b>method</b> to be unpolished and believed that concessions had been made for the gamepad. The unresponsive minimap, unintuitive default keybindings, and unfitting radial menus were highlighted as problems with the mouse and keyboard controls.|$|E

Advances in genetic engineering technologies {{make it possible}} to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic <b>control</b> <b>method</b> whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E

40|$|Quantum <b>control</b> <b>methods</b> are {{essential}} {{in many areas}} of experimental quantum physics, and they are critical for the manipulation of trapped atoms, ions and molecules and solid state systems. A broad range of quantum <b>control</b> <b>methods</b> has been developed for two-level systems, however the complexity of multi-level quantum systems make the development of analogous <b>control</b> <b>methods</b> extremely challenging. Here, we introduce a powerful technique to transform all existing two-level quantum <b>control</b> <b>methods</b> to new multi-level quantum <b>control</b> <b>methods.</b> As a practical demonstration of this technique, we develop both adiabatic and composite quantum <b>control</b> <b>methods</b> for the robust manipulation of a three-level system. We experimentally realise these methods using an $^{ 171 }$Yb$^+$ ion system, and measure the average infidelity of the process in both cases to be around $ 10 ^{- 4 }$, demonstrating that this technique can be used to develop a wide range of high-fidelity multi-level quantum <b>control</b> <b>methods</b> and can, for example, be applied as part of fault-tolerant quantum computing protocols.

5|$|As a countermeasure, {{cultures}} of the nematode Deladenus siricidicola {{have been used as}} biological control to protect trees since the 1980s. This parasite feeds on the mycelia of A.areolatum and is therefore a food competitor of wood wasp larvae. Where S.noctilio larvae are present, the parasite infects and sterilizes the eggs of female wasps, causing them to be infertile. These infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus spread the nematode. This <b>control</b> <b>method</b> has proven to be relatively successful to combat the Sirex–Amylostereum complex. In the Southern Hemisphere, where the technique has been widely employed, reductions of parasitism levels of 70%–100% have been achieved.|$|E

The Restrictors' leader had implanted microchips into the brainstems of all Deepground soldiers so as to ensure they never turn against the group. However, Weiss was able to overcome this <b>control</b> <b>method,</b> and the Tsviets wrenched control from the Restrictors. Although Weiss was successful in overthrowing the Restrictors, however, the leader of the Restrictors was able to implant a virus into Weiss' bloodstream.|$|E
5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in developing countries are not using a modern birth <b>control</b> <b>method.</b> Birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E

5|$|Following its predecessors, Brawl uses {{a battle}} system {{unlike that of}} typical {{fighting}} games. Players can choose from a large selection of characters, each attempting to knock their opponents off the screen as they fight on various stages. The characters in Brawl include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as the well-known Mario and Pikachu. Instead of using traditional health bars that start at a maximum value and lose value, Brawl characters start the game with 0%; the value rises as they take damage and may rise over 100% {{to a maximum of}} 999%. As a character's percentage increases, the character flies further back when hit. When a character is knocked beyond a stage's boundary and disappears from the screen, the character loses either a life, a point, or coins, depending on the mode of play. Brawl includes a function which allows players to create profiles with personalized button configurations for each <b>control</b> <b>method</b> along with their chosen username.|$|E

25|$|As control measures, baits are {{the norm}} in both {{agriculture}} and the garden. In recent years, iron phosphate baits have emerged and are preferred over the more toxic metaldehyde, especially because domestic or wild animals may {{be exposed to the}} bait. The environmentally safer iron phosphate {{has been shown to be}} at least as effective as baits. Methiocarb baits are no longer widely used. Parasitic nematodes (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) are a commercially available biological <b>control</b> <b>method</b> that are effective against a wide range of common slug species. The nematodes are applied in water and actively seek out slugs in the soil and infect them, leading to the death of the slug. This <b>control</b> <b>method</b> is suitable for use in organic growing systems. Other slug control methods are generally ineffective on a large scale, but can be somewhat useful in small gardens. These include beer traps, diatomaceous earth, crushed eggshells, coffee grounds, and copper. It is of scientific interest that salt kills slugs by causing water to leave the body owing to osmosis but this is not used for agricultural control as soil salinity is detrimental to crops.|$|E

It was estimated that this core heating and vaporization process happened in about 7.5 milliseconds, before enough steam had been formed to shut down the reaction, beating the steam shutdown by a few milliseconds. A key statistic makes it clear why the core blew apart: the reactor designed for a 3 MW power output operated momentarily at a peak of nearly 20 GW, a power density over 6,000 times higher than its safe operating limit.|$|E
25|$|The copepods can {{be added}} to water-storage {{containers}} where the mosquitoes breed. Copepods, primarily of the genera Mesocyclops and Macrocyclops (such as Macrocyclops albidus), can survive for periods of months in the containers, if the containers are not completely drained by their users. They attack, kill, and eat the younger first- and second-instar larvae of the mosquitoes. This biological <b>control</b> <b>method</b> is complemented by community trash removal and recycling to eliminate other possible mosquito-breeding sites. Because the water in these containers is drawn from uncontaminated sources such as rainfall, the risk of contamination by cholera bacteria is small, and in fact no cases of cholera have been linked to copepods introduced into water-storage containers. Trials using copepods to control container-breeding mosquitoes are underway in several other countries, including Thailand and the southern United States. The method, though, would be very ill-advised in areas where the guinea worm is endemic.|$|E
25|$|While local (to a {{database}} system) relaxed serializability methods compromise serializability for performance gain (and are utilized {{only when the}} application can tolerate possible resulting inaccuracies, or its integrity is unharmed), it is unclear that various proposed relaxed global serializability methods which compromise global serializability, provide any performance gain over commitment ordering which guarantees global serializability. Typically, the declared intention of such methods has not been performance gain over effective global serializability methods (which apparently have been unknown to the inventors), but rather correctness criteria alternatives {{due to lack of}} a known effective global serializability method. Oddly, some of them were introduced years after CO had been introduced, and some even quote CO without realizing that it provides an effective global serializability solution, and thus without providing any performance comparison with CO to justify them as alternatives to global serializability for some applications (e.g., Two-level serializability). Two-level serializability is even presented as a major global concurrency <b>control</b> <b>method</b> in a 2010 edition of a text-book on databases (authored by two of the original authors of Two-level serializability, where one of them, Avi Silberschatz, is also an author of the original Strong recoverability articles).
