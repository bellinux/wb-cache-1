50|$|The <b>Caucasian</b> <b>grouse</b> is a {{sedentary}} species, breeding in the Caucasus and Pontic Mountains {{of northeast}} Turkey on open slopes with low Rhododendron or other scrubs but in proximity to deciduous broad-leaf forest. These bird {{have a group}} display or lek in May and June. Unlike the male Eurasian black grouse, the <b>Caucasian</b> <b>grouse</b> display is almost mute but for a thin whistling of the cock fluttering his wings as he leaps and turns in the air, producing a flash of white as the underwing feathers are briefly revealed. The hen lays up to ten eggs in a ground scrape and takes all responsibility for nesting and caring for the chicks, as is typical with gamebirds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Caucasian</b> <b>grouse</b> (Tetrao mlokosiewiczi) {{is a large}} bird in the grouse family. It {{is closely}} related to the black grouse (T. tetrix). It occurs in extreme southeastern Europe and {{adjacent}} regions. The scientific name of this bird commemorates the Polish naturalist Ludwik Mlokosiewicz.|$|E
50|$|The {{black grouse}} or blackgame or blackcock (Tetrao tetrix) {{is a large}} game bird in the grouse family. It is a {{sedentary}} species, breeding across northern Eurasia in moorland and bog areas near to woodland, mostly boreal. The black grouse {{is closely related to}} the <b>Caucasian</b> <b>grouse.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{sanctuary}} protects mountain forests consisting {{mainly of}} oak trees. This environment forms a valuable habitat for animals like the brown bear, roe deer and the <b>caucasian</b> black <b>grouse.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} fishes in the streams of the reserve: brown trout, common minnow and European loach. Teberda is an {{important}} bird area, with 226 species recorded. The near-threatened <b>Caucasian</b> balck <b>grouse</b> is {{a resident of the}} reserve, and endemic to the Caucasus.|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} gamebirds, the cock (male) {{is larger than}} the hen (female), {{measuring}} 50-55 cm compared to her length of 37-42 cm. The cock is very distinctive, with all-black plumage, apart from red eyebrows, and a long, deeply forked tail. The female <b>Caucasian</b> <b>grouse</b> is grey with dark barring, and has a cackling call.|$|E
50|$|The {{natural forest}} of Hatila Valley National Park and the {{surrounding}} area is rich in wildlife. Large mammals found here include grey wolf, red fox, lynx, leopard, brown bear, wild goat, chamois, roe deer, wild boar and European hare. Many birds of prey pass through during their migrations, and golden eagle, long-legged buzzard, peregrine falcon, Caspian snowcock, <b>Caucasian</b> <b>grouse,</b> chukar partridge and grey partridge can be seen here.|$|E
5000|$|The mammals in {{the park}} are those typical of the forested areas of north slope of the Caucuses, with 34 species that include wolves, jackals, and chamois, lynx, and fox, {{as well as the}} Near-Threatened West Caucasian Tur.The {{entirety}} of Alaniya NP has been a designated an [...] "Important Bird and Biodiversity Area" [...] (IBA) by Birdlife International, citing the presence of vulnerable trigger species such as the Near-Threatened Bearded Vulture and <b>Caucasian</b> <b>Grouse.</b> [...] 116 species of bird are found {{in the park}}, with 42 species known to be breeding.|$|E
50|$|Species that he {{discovered}} and that were {{named after him}} include the <b>Caucasian</b> Black <b>Grouse</b> (Tetrao mlokosiewiczi) and the Golden Peony (Paeonia mlokosewitschii). Beginning in 1889, Młokosiewicz urged {{the protection of the}} forested area at Lagodekhi; in 1912, three years after his death, the Russian viceregent in the Caucasus region declared what is now Lagodekhi Protected Areas.|$|R
40|$|Large scale land use/cover {{changes and}} habitat {{fragmentation}} {{have been associated}} with the decline of many wildlife populations in ecological sensitive regions. The main goal {{of this study was to}} quantify the spatial pattern changes in <b>Caucasian</b> Black <b>Grouse</b> habitat in Arasbaran Biosphere Reserve, Northwest of Iran in a period of 24 years (1987 – 2011). <b>Caucasian</b> black <b>grouse</b> (Tetrao mlokosiewiczi) in Iran is restricted to the Arasbaran area, and the populations and range of this specialist bird species have been declining over the last decades. This study focuses on the landscape structure changes of black grouse habitat in Arasbaran Biosphere reserve. We used Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite images from 1987 and 2011, and ETM+ from 2001, for analysis of the spatial patterns of land use/cover patches. The satellite images were geometrically corrected and classified. For quantifying landscape pattern changes, various landscape metrics were derived from spatial analysis software FRAGSTATS, including NP (Number of Patches), LPI (Largest Patch Index) and TE (Total Edge). The results indicated that the proportion of forest was significantly decreased from 39. 95 % to 31. 95 %, and proportion of grassland was decreased from 44. 45 % to 38. 44 % during the last 24 years, while proportion of dominated by astragalus was increased from 3. 30 % to 15. 65 %. Total Edge (TE) was decreased 8000 meters at altitude over 1800 meters. Our result provided quantitative data on habitat loss and landscape fragmentation in Arasbaran Biosphere reserve and indicated negative impacts of the landscape structure changes on Black grouse habitat...|$|R

The main purpose {{of the project was}} {{connected}} with conservation of globally and regionally threatened species (Armenian mouflon, bezoar goat, Caucasian leopard, common otter, <b>Caucasian</b> black <b>grouse</b> etc.) through support to the Government of Armenia in establishment of a new protected area (Zangezur sanctuary) in the southern region of the country. To achieve the project purpose several activities were carried out: survey on biodiversity, mapping and clarification of boundaries, development of management plan and other legal documents (draft decision on establishment of the sanctuary, charters, boundaries description etc.), infrastructure development and training of the sanctuary staff.

50|$|During surveys {{carried out}} between 1993 and 2002, zoologists found {{evidence}} of leopards in the upper forest and alpine zones of the Pontic Mountains in northern Anatolia. In this area, possible prey species include wild ungulates such as deer, chamois, wild goat, wild pig but also European hare and <b>Caucasian</b> <b>grouse.</b> It is unknown whether {{a significant number of}} leopards still exist in Anatolia. Extensive trophy hunting is thought to be the prime factor for the decline and possible extinction of the Anatolian leopard. One hunter named Mantolu Hasan killed at least fifteen leopards between 1930 and 1950.|$|E
50|$|Goris is {{situated}} in the valley of Goris River, also known as Vararak River. The valley is surrounded with the Zangezur Mountains. The town has an average elevation of 1,385 metres above sea level. The surrounding mountains are famous for their medieval cave-dwellings {{carved out of the}} soft rock in the southern and eastern parts of the town. The Goris Wildlife Sanctuary {{is situated}} at the southeast of the town at a height ranging between 1400 and 2800 meters above seal level, covering an area of 18.5 km². <b>Caucasian</b> <b>grouse,</b> roe deer and brown bear are among the notable animals in the sanctuary.|$|E
5000|$|The Caucasus {{is an area}} {{of great}} {{ecological}} importance. The region is included in the list of 34 world biodiversity hotspots. It harbors some 6400 species of higher plants, 1600 of which are endemic to the region. [...] Its wildlife includes Persian leopards, brown bears, wolves, bison, marals, golden eagles and hooded crows. Among invertebrates, some 1000 spider species are recorded in the Caucasus. Most of Arthropod biodiversity is concentrated on Great and Lesser Caucasus ranges. The region has a high level of endemism and a number of relict animals and plants, the fact reflecting presence of refugial forests, which survived the Ice Age in the Caucasus Mountains. The Caucasus forest refugium is the largest throughout the Western Asian (near Eastern) region. The area has multiple representatives of disjunct relict groups of plants with the closest relatives in Eastern Asia, southern Europe, and even North America. Over 70 species of forest snails of the region are endemic. Some relict species of vertebrates are Caucasian parsley frog, Caucasian salamander, Robert's snow vole, and <b>Caucasian</b> <b>grouse,</b> and there are almost entirely endemic groups of animals such as lizards of genus Darevskia. In general, species composition of this refugium is quite distinct and differs from that of the other Western Eurasian refugia.The natural landscape is one of mixed forest, with substantial areas of rocky ground above the treeline. The Caucasus Mountains are also noted for a dog breed, the Caucasian Shepherd Dog (Rus. Kavkazskaya Ovcharka, Geo. Nagazi). Vincent Evans noted that minke whales have been recorded from the Black Sea.|$|E
50|$|The {{mountains}} are generally covered by dense forests, predominantly of conifers. The Northern Anatolian conifer and deciduous forests is an ecoregion which covers {{most of the}} range, while the Caucasus mixed forests extend across the far-eastern end of the range, known as the Kaçkar Mountains. The region is home to Eurasian wildlife such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk, golden eagle, eastern imperial eagle, lesser spotted eagle, <b>Caucasian</b> black <b>grouse,</b> red-fronted serin, and wallcreeper. The narrow coastal strip between {{the mountains and the}} Black Sea, known as Pontus, is home to the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests, which contain some of the world's few temperate rainforests. The Anatolian Plateau, which lies south of the range, has a considerably drier and more continental climate than the humid and mild coast.|$|R

The narrow coastal strip between the Pontic Mountains and the Black Sea is home to the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests, which contain some of the world's few temperate rainforests. The Turkish pine is mostly found in Turkey and other east Mediterranean countries. Several wild species of tulip are native to Anatolia, and the flower was first introduced to Western Europe with species taken from the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century.|$|R
5000|$|Arasbaran {{is home to}} 215 {{species of}} birds, notably the <b>Caucasian</b> black <b>grouse,</b> grey partridge, black francolin, and common pheasant, 29 species of reptiles, 48 species of mammals, notably wild goat, wild boar, brown bear, wolf, lynx, and leopard, and 17 species of fish. There is an effort going on to revitalise(??) the extinct sub-species of Caspian red deer local to the area (If extinct then {{how can it be}} [...] "revitalised"?). The local flora include hornbeam, sumac, and Berberis. A unique {{characteristic}} of Arasbaran forests is the ubiquity of edible wild trees. For instance, a patch of forest between Aghaweye and Oskolou includes hazelnut trees. The large walnut and Cornus mas trees, which grow wild alongside streams, provide an important income source for inhabitants. More exotic plant species, such as redcurrant, truffle and herbs with application in traditional medicine significantly add to the ecological importance of Arasbaran region.|$|R
40|$|Although Caucasus is {{an internationally}} {{recognized}} area of avian endemism {{there are only}} three species that are considered endemic to the Cauacasus (Stattersfield et al. 1998). Among these three species, Caucasian snowcock (Tetraogallus caucasicus) inhabits high alpine habitats, <b>Caucasian</b> <b>grouse</b> (Lyrurus mlokosiewiczi) and Caucasian chiffchaff (Phylloscopus lorenzii) inhabit subalpine habitats. Only <b>Caucasian</b> <b>grouse</b> has a sister species, black grouse (L. tetrix; Drovetski 2002) whose range includes Europe. The closest relatives of the other two endemic species inhabit the mountains of western Asia. In addition to the three endemic species, Caucasus hosts numerous endemic subspecies (Stepanyan 2003). Many of these subspecies have distinct phenotypes that are easily distinguishable from their European conspecifics. From {{the point of view of}} traditional systematics such strong phenotypic differences are usually interpreted as further evidence for unique evolutionary history of Caucasian avifauna. Alpine and forest habitats of Western Caucasus are currently separated from similar habitats in Europe by a wide belt of steppes to the north and the Black Sea to the west.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} approaches for policy making in order to biodiversity conservation and wildlife management is co-management of natural resources. Local stakeholders are one of the main elements in this approach. This is necessary to consider social network analysis in the framework of social-ecological systems toward biodiversity conservation and sustainable wildlife management. In this study, social network analysis and understanding key actors or social powers for implementation of co-management toward biodiversity and sustainable habitat management of <b>Caucasian</b> Black <b>Grouse</b> in Kharil village of Arasbaran area had discussed. The results illustrated key actors, social powers in environmental decisions. Also, according to in-degree and out-degree centrality, actors who have social power and dominance have revealed. Yo-Al actor has highest social power and Vahe-Eb actor has highest social dominance and also Ka-Gh actor has highest betweenens role in the study society. These actors will be outlined as local leaders in the process of ecosystem co-management in the study area. The outcomes of this research could be used for conducting co-management and biodiversity management action plan...|$|R
