40|$|Hematopoiesis is the {{generation}} of all mature blood cells from a rare pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These blood cells serve a variety of essential functions in the vertebrate body, including gas transport, defense against pathogens, blood <b>clotting</b> and <b>removal</b> of apoptotic cells.

The hematopoietic system is made up of all mature blood cell types including erythrocytes, platelets, and other cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Multiple waves of hematopoiesis occur during embryonic development.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite {{availability}} of an approved drug to treat acute cerebral ischemia, most patients with stroke {{do not realize}} a good outcome. A method that would rapidly increase or restore cerebral perfusion before irreversible cell death should improve patient outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recently {{had the opportunity to}} treat 6 middle-aged-to-elderly patients who presented with signs and symptoms of acute cerebral ischemia, by mechanically removing their (predominantly) middle cerebral artery clots by using a new retrieval device that had been previously approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for intravascular retrieval of foreign bodies.

40|$|Enteric fever is a {{systemic}} illness which in-cludes typhoid and paratyphoid fever [1]. The mortality of untreated cases {{can be as}} high as 30 %, whereas in treated cases it is less than 1 % [1]. Specific antibacterial therapy is avail-able. But resistance and treatment failure are increasingly being reported. Rapid accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment are neces-sary to decrease mortality and morbidity. De-finitive diagnosis on clinical grounds alone is difficult as the clinical pattern of enteric fever has changed from its classical presentation. Several serological tests have been developed. The role of classic Widal test is controversial, as it lacks in sensitivity and specificity [2].

40|$|A {{method of}} local {{cerebral}} hypothermia with circulatory arrest {{of one or}} more of the major vessels of the neck is described. Ten clinical cases have been operated upon, and much has been learned of the operative difficulties including an increased operating time and a high complication rate. There were four post-operative deaths, in one (case 1) there was some evidence that the technique protected the perfused part of the brain from anoxic damage. In case 9 the method itself caused particularly bad operating conditions and eventually the patient died. Case 2 and case 4, like case 1, were patients who were severely ill and who might well have died whatever technique had been used in operating upon them. Of the survivors, one patient (case 3) had a post-operative intracerebral clot which developed during closure and another (case 6) had an intracerebral <b>clot</b> which required <b>removal</b> after 24 hours. Another patient (case 8) had some delay in return to full mental function. In the light of this experience we cannot regard the method in its present form as satisfactory for general use. In our view, its further development requires the discovery of a more effective means of neutralizing the anticoagulants, or doing without anticoagulants altogether. It is also necessary to develop a method of monitoring parts of the brain distant from those directly perfused to give warning of threatened anoxia. Until such time as these problems can be solved we have returned to other procedures but are publishing our results in the hope that other workers will be able to improve upon them...|$|R

Stent retrievers are accepted as the most effective devices for intracranial thrombectomy. Objective : To analyze the mechanical properties of stent retrievers, their behavior during retrieval, and interaction with different clots and to identify device features that might correlate with the effectiveness of thrombus removal. Materials and methods :All stent retrievers available in France up to June 2015 were evaluated by mechanical and functional tests aimed at investigating the variation of their radial force and their behavior during retrieval. Devices were also tested during in vitro thrombectomies using white and red experimental thrombi produced with human blood. Functional tests and in vitro thrombectomies were conducted using a rigid 3 D printed vascular model. Results :Mechanical tests showed a variation in radial force during retrieval for each stent. A constant radial force during retrieval was related to continuous cohesion over the vessel wall and {{a higher rate of}} <b>clot</b> <b>removal</b> efficacy. All stent retrievers failed when interacting with white large thrombi (diameter ≥ 6 mm). Conclusions :None of the tested devices were effective in removing white clots of large diameter (≥ 6 mm).

40|$|Background and Purpose—Thrombin-activable {{fibrinolysis}} inhibitor (TAFI) is {{a recently}} identified fibrinolysis inhibitor in plasma. The {{purpose of this}} work was to study TAFI levels in the acute phase of ischemic stroke and their relationship with stroke evolution. Methods—In 30 consecutive ischemic stroke patients, TAFI plasma levels were measured by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (percentage of the pooled reference kit expressed as meanSD) and compared with the values obtained in 30 healthy control subjects. All samples were drawn within the first 24 hours after symptom onset (mean, 4. 6 hours) and before any treatment was started. Results—TAFI plasma concentration was significantly higher (P 0. 001) in stroke patients (158. 453. 2 %) than in healthy control subjects (105. 630. 2 %). The highest TAFI levels were found in cases of neurological deterioration (worsening, 198. 163. 0 %; stability, 130. 539. 3 %; improvement, 173. 952. 0 %; P 0. 057).

Key Words: carboxypeptidase U cerebral ischemia stroke TAFI thrombolysis Thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), also known asprocarboxypeptidase B, is a plasma zymogen that potently inhibits fibrinolysis 1 when converted to an enzyme. The direct action of TAFI as an inhibitor of <b>clot</b> lysis involves <b>removal</b> of carboxy-terminal lysyl and arginyl residues from partially degraded fibrin. 2 Consequently, plasminogen binding sites are eliminated, and plasminogen activation and fibrinolysis are inhibited. 3 Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that increased TAFI activity is associated with a proneness to thrombosis. In fact, elevated TAFI plasma levels have been found in men with symptomatic coronary artery disease 4 and are a mild risk factor for deep vein thrombosis. 5 Actually, no data are available on TAFI in stroke patients or experimental brain ischemia, a field in which TAFI overexpression might block thrombus resolution.

40|$|The most {{efficient}} treatment for acute arterial embolism is operative embolectomy using Fogarty's balloon catheter, especially if a single large artery is involved. Unfortunately, although the early surgical success of arterial thromboembolectomy often seems acceptable, the early clinical outcome still remains unsatisfactory.

40|$|The {{clotting}} {{process is}} a dynamic array of multiple processes which {{can be described in}} four phases: pla-telet plug initiation and formation, clotting process propagation by the coagulation cascade, clotting ter-mination by antithrombotic mechanisms and <b>clot</b> <b>removal</b> by fibrinolysis. The liver plays a central role in each of these phases of clotting process, as it synthesizes the majority of coagulation factors and proteins involved in fibrinolysis as well as thrombopoeitin, which is responsible for platelet production from me-gakaryocytes. Many pathological processes associated with cirrhosis, such as portal hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, as well as co-morbid conditions, may also alter the coagulation process.

METHODS: We analyzed 596 patients prospectively added to our database from July of 1999 to November of 2005 concerning {{the risk of}} shunt dependency after clipping versus coiling. Factors analyzed included age; sex; Hunt and Hess grade; Fisher grade; acute hydrocephalus; intraventricular hemorrhage; angiographic vasospasm; and number, size, and location of aneurysms. In addition, a meta-analysis of available data from the literature was performed identifying four studies with quantitative data on the frequency of clip, coil, and shunt dependency. RESULTS: The institutional series revealed Hunt and Hess grade, Fisher grade, acute hydrocephalus, intraventricular hemorrhage, and angiographic vasospasm as significant (P < 0. 05) risk factors for shunt dependency after a univariate analysis. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, we isolated intraventricular hemorrhage, acute hydrocephalus, and angiographic vasospasm as independent, significant risk factors for shunt dependency.

Conclusion—While the 15 mole % BPA devices provided the best trade-off between device integrity and performance, other SMP systems that offer recovery stresses above 5 kPa without increasing brittleness to the point of causing device failure would be more suitable for this application. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHeparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} {{is a rare}} but serious {{complication of}} heparin therapy. Most of cases are related to unfractionated heparin, but a few are due to low molecular weight heparin sometimes associated with unfractionated heparin. A patient with pulmonary contusions after chest injury developed a catheter related subclavian vein thrombosis on day 16. He was treated by increasing doses of low molecular weight heparin. Aortic and renal thromboses occurred on day 21. Surgical thrombectomy, performed after starting alternative anticoagulation treatment led to complete arterial recovery. In case of suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin, heparin treatment must be discontinued before the results of biological tests become available. Arterial and/or venous thrombosis is a serious complication of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The treatment has two aims: first, to restore arterial patency by <b>clot</b> <b>removal</b> by thrombectomy, bypass or thrombolysis, and second, to avoid new thrombosis formation by substitutive anticoagulation treatment: danaparoid may have cross-reaction with heparin, or lepirudin has anaphylactic risks and needs biological follow-up. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis can be complicated by death or disabilities such as amputations, stroke, renal or bowel infarction. Once HIT has been diagnosed heparin should never be given again, but if cardiopulmonary bypass is required, it might be reintroduced during operation only if serum antibodies have disappeared...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{ischemic stroke}} {{is a major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in Europe, North America, and Asia. Its treatment has completely changed over the past decade with different interventional approaches, such as intravenous trials, intra-arterial trials, combined intravenous/intra-arterial trials, and newer devices to mechanically remove the clot from intracranial arteries. Intravenous thrombolysis with tissue plaminogen activator (tPA) within 4. 5 hours of symptoms onset significantly improved clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Pharmacological intra-arterial thrombolysis has been shown effective until 6 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion and offers a higher rate of recanalization compared with intravenous thrombolysis, whereas combined intravenous/ intra-arterial thrombolysis seems to be as safe as isolated intravenous thrombolysis. The more recent advances in reperfusion therapies have been done in mechanical embolus disruption or removal. Merci Retriever and Penumbra System have been approved for <b>clot</b> <b>removal</b> in brain arteries, but not as a therapeutic modality for acute ischemic stroke since it is no clear whether mechanical thrombectomy improves clinical outcome in acute stroke. However, mechanical devices are being used in clinical practice for patients who are ineligible for tPA or who have failed to respond to intravenous tPA. We summarize the results of the major thrombolytic trials and the latest neurointerventional approaches to ischemic stroke...|$|E
40|$|Thrombosis is {{produced}} by {{the formation of a}} clot inside blood vessels causing an abrupt interruption of the blood flow. In the cerebral arteries, this occlusion can take place due to the presence of a clot that has formed at another location of greater diameter. It then obstructs the cerebral artery due to its smaller cross section. The process concerning the removal of this obstruction involves catheterisation. The experimental probe under study in this paper was developed by Dr G. Pearce and Reverend Neil Perkinson [1]. The probe, which when developed further may form the basis of a new Thrombectomy Aspiration Device (TAD) is called the GPTAD. Once fully developed, the GPTAD may provide a means of <b>clot</b> <b>removal</b> from vessels in the human arterial system e. g. the cerebral vessels. The modelling that we present in this paper, taking into account the catheter, the probe, artery, blood clot and adhesion forces, may assist with the optimisation of the design of the GPTAD probe. In the model used for the simulation both mechanical and hydraulic aspects have been considered with the purpose of combining the effect of the fluid-blood transmission for the different sections of the vein and the cathete...|$|E
