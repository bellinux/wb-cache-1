25|$|Although the {{question}} of the equivalence of the identities of Yeshu and Jesus has at times been debated, many historians agree that the above 2nd-century passage is likely to be about Jesus, Peter Schäfer stating that there <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> this narrative of the execution in the Talmud refers to Jesus of Nazareth. Robert Van Voorst states that the Sanhedrin 43a reference to Jesus can be confirmed not only from the reference itself, but from the context that surrounds it.|$|E

For these souls may be likened unto the ancient inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, who, prior to the Mission of Muḥammad, were like unto savages.

Likewise, these Indians, should they be educated and guided, there <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> they will become so illumined as to enlighten the whole world....|$|E

25|$|There <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> most early peoples {{which have}} left records knew {{something}} of numeration and mechanics, {{and that a}} few were also acquainted with the elements of land-surveying. In particular, the Egyptians paid attention to geometry and numbers, and the Phoenicians to practical arithmetic, book-keeping, navigation, and land-surveying. The results attained by these people {{seem to have been}} accessible, under certain conditions, to travelers. It is probable that the knowledge of the Egyptians and Phoenicians was largely the result of observation and measurement, and represented the accumulated experience of many ages.|$|E
25|$|Peter Schäfer {{states that}} there <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> the {{narrative}} of the execution of Jesus in the Talmud refers to Jesus of Nazareth, but states that the rabbinic literature in question are not Tannaitic but from a later Amoraic period and may have drawn on the Christian gospels, {{and may have been}} written as responses to them. Bart Ehrman and separately Mark Allan Powell state that given that the Talmud references are quite late, they can give no historically reliable information about the teachings or actions of Jesus during his life.|$|E
500|$|In Seery v. United States the {{government}} argued that an executive agreement {{allowed it to}} confiscate property in Austria owned by an American citizen without compensation.

[...] He guessed that [...] "a disturbed electrical condition of the atmosphere" [...] was probably responsible. Daniel Pauly comments that Darwin [...] "was lucky with most of his guesses, but not here", noting that biochemistry was too little known, and that the complex evolution of the marine animals involved [...] "would have been too much for comfort".|$|E

[...] He chose the former option: Colin Harper states that [...] "There <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Bert's creativity, reliability, energy, {{commitment}} and quality of performance were all rescued dramatically by the decision to quit boozing."

500|$|In Talley v. California (1960), the Court {{struck down}} a Los Angeles city {{ordinance}} that made {{it a crime to}} distribute anonymous pamphlets.

[...] In McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission (1995), the Court {{struck down a}}n Ohio statute that made it a crime to distribute anonymous campaign literature. However, in Meese v.

500|$|Justice John Paul Stevens {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court. [...] Stevens stated that [...] "There <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> the challenged practices of the NCAA constitute a 'restraint of trade'" [...] but noted not all restraints of trade were unreasonable, and that only an unreasonable restraint was prohibited by the Sherman Antitrust Act. [...] Stevens noted that a league governing body was necessary for sporting events to take place and determined that the rule of reason, not [...] rules applied to the case. [...] Stevens determined that since the NCAA restrained price and output, it created a system that was unrelated to a free and competitive market. [...] Since the NCAA television plan constituted a restraint of trade on its face, it placed the burden on the NCAA of establishing an affirmative defense that would justify the deviation from a free market.|$|E
500|$|Marquis {{has many}} {{critics who say}} he either exaggerated {{the role played by}} suicide or is entirely mistaken; Hardorff says the theory is {{discounted}} by most academics. [...] Hardorff suggests that Marquis may have made errors due to the use of sign language which, he claims, cannot convey the nuances of language. [...] Despite this criticism, Hardorff still maintains that Marquis' work is of great importance. [...] There <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Wooden Leg is indeed relating a tale of mass suicide. [...] In the book he discusses at length what may have been the cause. [...] The effects of whisky was a common theory amongst the Indians, but Wooden Leg believed the prayers of medicine men to have been the cause. [...] Wooden Leg's only taste of whisky up to the time of the battle had been a mouthful—which he immediately spat out—that he took from a captured bottle. [...] In later life Wooden Leg changed his mind and subscribed to the whisky theory after experiencing the effects of alcohol first-hand.|$|E

500|$|After a {{visit to}} Birmingham, Bache moved to Rome in 1863 and lived there the next two years. While there he {{received}} private lessons from Liszt, {{one of the few}} pupils thus privileged; most of Liszt's students attended only his master classes. He also heard Liszt play his own music on many occasions in private homes, including a then-rare performance of the Piano Sonata in B minor. Liszt helped him prepare for several public concerts in Rome and encouraged him to learn some difficult pieces that Bache initially felt unable to play; these pieces included Liszt's transcriptions of Gounod's Faust Waltz and Meyerbeer's [...] "Patineurs" [...] Waltz from his opera Le prophète. These lessons, the kindness that Liszt continually showed, and Bache's exposure to Liszt in general, became a life-defining experience. Liszt expected him to work hard and Bache applied himself with a purpose to his keyboard studies. The same [...] "musician of high standing" [...] that Constance quotes about Bache's years in Leipzig also states that [...] "there <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> it was his friendship with Liszt that he owed that enthusiasm and power of sustained hard work which distinguished him during his career in London, and which was often the astonishment of those who had known him in earlier years." ...|$|E
