50|$|A <b>cant</b> <b>hook</b> is a {{traditional}} logging tool consisting of a wooden lever handle with a movable metal hook called a dog at one end, used for handling and turning logs and cants, especially in sawmills. Unlike the similar peavey, the <b>cant</b> <b>hook</b> has a blunt tip, often bearing teeth.|$|E
5000|$|A logging tool {{description}} {{from the}} Lumberman's Museum at Patten, Maine, reads in part: [...] "A cant dog or <b>cant</b> <b>hook</b> {{was used for}} lifting, turning, and prying logs when loading sleds and on the drive. At first, a swivel hook on a pole with nothing {{to hold it in}} position was used. This was called a swing dingle." [...] However, the term swing dingle is more often published as being a type of logging sled. These early types are also called a ring dog or ring dog <b>cant</b> <b>hook.</b> In 1858, Joseph Peavey, a blacksmith in Stillwater, Maine, made a rigid clasp to encircle the cant dog handle with the hook on one side. It moved up and down, but not sideways. All loggers have used it ever since." ...|$|E

5000|$|Song of the Pines (Philadelphia, PA: John C. Winston Company; first edition. 1949) {{was part}} of the [...] "Land of the Free" [...] series of children's books. The book {{highlighted}} the contribution of Norwegian immigrants to the Wisconsin logging industry. The book focuses on the story of a 15-year-old orphan named Nils who emigrates to America in the 1850s. Nils is a trained knife sharpener who sets up a business making <b>cant</b> <b>hooks,</b> a traditional logging tool. The novel was edited by Erick Berry and illustrated by the artist Richard Floethe (1901-1988). First published in 1949, it became a Newbery Honor recipient in 1950.|$|R
5000|$|The Grand was {{important}} to the rapid development of West-Central Michigan during the 1850s to 1880s, as logs from Michigan's rich pine and oak forests floated down the Grand River for milling. After the Civil War, many soldiers found jobs as lumberjacks cutting logs and guiding them down the river with pike poles, peaveys, and <b>cant</b> <b>hooks.</b> The men wore bright red flannel, felt clothes, and spiked boots to hold them onto the floating logs; these boots chewed up the wooden sidewalks and flooring of the local bars, leading one hotel owner to supply carpet slippers to all river drivers who entered his hotel. The [...] "jacks" [...] earned $1 to $3 per day and all the [...] "vittles" [...] they could eat, which was usually a considerable amount.|$|R
50|$|In lumbering {{they are}} used to control logs {{floating}} on a river in a log drive and constructing log rafts. Pike poles used in log rafting were originally made of wood, typically spruce or fir. In the mid-1960s they began to be made of aluminum tubing plugged with a wooden knob to maintain buoyancy. Specialized logging tools of similar appearance are peavey and <b>cant</b> <b>hook.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The peavey {{was named}} for {{blacksmith}} Joseph Peavey of Upper Stillwater, Maine, who invented the tool as a refinement to the <b>cant</b> <b>hook</b> (also known as a [...] "cant dog") in the 1850s. Many lumberjacks use the terms interchangeably, though a peavey has a spike {{in the end of}} the handle, and a cant dog has a blunt end or possibly small teeth for friction.|$|E
5000|$|A pickaroon (or picaroon) is a wood-handled (may {{be other}} {{materials}} also), metal-topped log handling tool. [...] It is distinguished from a pike pole {{by having a}} shorter handle, no metal point, and an opposite curve to its hook (toward the handle rather than away); and from both a <b>cant</b> <b>hook</b> and peavey by having a fixed hook facing its handle rather than a pivoting one facing away.|$|E
5000|$|Nick Adams' father, Dr. Adams, hires {{a crew of}} Native Americans {{to remove}} the four large beech logs from the lake's log boom that drifted up on his beach. Dick Boulton, his son Eddy, and Billy Tabeshaw, come through the back gate from the woods, {{bringing}} <b>cant</b> <b>hooks,</b> axes and a crosscut saw to cut the logs into cord wood. Boulton compliments Dr. Adams on the timber he is stealing from the logging company; Dr. Adams asserts that the logs are driftwood. Boulton washes a log in the surf, uncovers its mark and tells the doctor it belongs to White and McNally. The doctor becomes uncomfortable, decides not to saw up the logs, but Boulton says {{it makes no difference}} to him who the logs are stolen from. The two men engage in a verbal exchange, and when the doctor threatens Boulton with violence, Boulton mocks him.|$|R
