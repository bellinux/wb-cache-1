30|$|From Table  7 and Fig.  10, it {{can also}} be found that the {{interface}} preparation method influenced the horizontal shear stress of composite beam effectively. This highlights the importance of aggregate interlock action for interface shear capacity. It can also be found that there is no obvious trend that can be established to describe the influence of concrete strength on the horizontal shear stress of composite beams, which was consistent with the results from Patnaik (2001). The higher horizontal shear capacity of composites beams with the target slab concrete strength of 40  MPa may be associated with its higher splitting tensile strength as shown in Table  3. With the increasing of <b>clamping</b> <b>stress</b> (from 0 to 0.60  MPa), {{there is no doubt that}} specimens with higher <b>clamping</b> <b>stress</b> got a higher value of interface shear stress. However, when the <b>clamping</b> <b>stress</b> increased from 0.60 to 1.21  MPa, interface shear stress decreased. A possible explanation for this unusual phenomenon may be the non-simultaneous shear failure of interface. As discussed in Part 4.2, this resulted in the shear capacity of interface reinforcements cannot reach yielding simultaneously and this unusual appearance had also been found in the recent research (Sneed et al. 2016; Jiang et al. 2016). These indicate the necessity for retaining an upper limit for horizontal shear stress. Higher <b>clamping</b> <b>stress</b> would not certainly promote the interface shear capacity. Without reaching interface shear failure, Beam R- 40 - 17 and Beam S- 40 - 17 reached a higher horizontal shear capacity. On the other hand, higher slab concrete strength and higher <b>clamping</b> <b>stress</b> caused a larger slip at horizontal shear failure.|$|E

The rotating blade is <b>clamped</b> and <b>stressed</b> initially in the radial direction at the outer periphery, while the inner edge is subjected to both the in-plane stationary and the lateral dynamic slicing loads from the workpiece.

In the experimental program 12 beams and necessary control cylinders were tested to provide experimental cases with the variables of interface preparation, <b>clamping</b> <b>stress</b> and lightweight slab concrete strength. Compared with 7 equations developed previously, it has been found that those formulas, especially the ones from current AASHTO and ACI design codes, give a conservative theoretical prediction of horizontal shear capacity of composite T-beams. Based on the experimental results, a more accurate equation was developed to predict the interface shear transfer strength of composite concrete T-beam. By comparing the experimental results of previous beam tests and shear-friction push-off tests for different types of concrete with both rough and smooth interface published in literature, it has been found that the proposed formula is reliable in predicting the horizontal shear strength of concrete composite T-beams.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{presented}} to achieve both high strength and high fracture toughness of fibre composites {{by means of a}} microductile interlayer between fibre and matrix. Experiments conducted on epoxy matrix composites reinforced with unidirectional Kevlar and carbon fibres (KFRP and CFRP) with a thin layer of thermoplastic coating, e. g. polyvinyl alcohol (PVAL), on the fibre show promising results for transverse fracture toughness without any significant loss in strength properties. Variation of fracture toughness with temperature is a direct manifestation of the dependence of the interface properties on the parameter studied. Interlaminar fracture toughness determined in mode I and mixed mode I/II delamination is also shown to be encouraging. Surface analysis of the fibre and composite interfaces confirms the distinctive failure mechanisms between the composites with and without the PVAL coating.

The solutions allow the determination of typical fibre/matrix interfacial properties such as the interfacial fracture toughness, Gic, the coefficient of friction, μ, and the residual <b>clamping</b> <b>stress,</b> q 0. Under cyclic loading the interfacial properties are expected to degrade as a result of repetitive abrasion, and a power law function is assumed between μ and the number of elapsed cycles, N. However, Gic is assumed to be unaffected and a fracture mechanics based debond criterion is derived for the relationship between the external applied stress, the debond length and the reduced friction coefficient for both fibre pull-out and fibre push-out. In addition, the relative displacements between the free fibre end and the matrix top are obtained for cyclic fatigue when the fibre is loaded and unloaded. A relationship obtained for the protrusion (or intrusion) length in fibre pull-out (or push-out) experiments allows the severity of the interface frictional degradation to be evaluated and characterised.

40|$|Past {{experience}} {{has shown that}} stringer-to-cross-girder connections in riveted railway bridges are susceptible to fatigue cracking. This fatigue damage is caused by secondary stresses, which develop in the different components of the connection. For this reason, more detailed analysis techniques are needed to capture this type of behaviour. In this paper, a finite element (FE) model of a typical riveted railway bridge is developed by incorporating the detailed local geometry of a stringer-to-cross-girder connection into the global bridge model. Before {{the development of this}} model, benchmark FE studies are carried out on a double-lap joint and the results are presented in terms of stress concentration factors and stress gradients. Further verification studies are carried out on a local bridge connection FE model, in terms of its rotational stiffness. After this investigation, a refined FE model of the bridge is analysed under the passage of a freight train. Principal stress histories at different components of the connection are obtained, which are then combined with the plain material S–N curve, in order to identify the most fatigue-critical locations of the connection. These are identified as being the rivet holes and, in some cases, the angle fillet. By considering different rivet clamping stresses and different rivet defect scenarios it is found that the most damaging effects are caused by the presence of clearance between the rivet shank and the hole, and the loss of a rivet.

The soft <b>clamps</b> distribute the <b>stress</b> amongst the fibers through elastic forces. The model display three distinct modes of damage development {{depending on the}} elasticity of the clamps {{and the distribution of}} fiber strength. 1) The stiff clamp regime: The elastic forces of the clamps are in effect turned off. The model behaves like equal load sharing and damage is developing through random dilution of the system. 2) The soft clamp - quasi brittle regime: The elastic forces are turned on. The strength distribution of the fibers are large enough to affect the damage development. The elastic forces and the heterogeneities of the system are competing. 3) The soft clamp - brittle regime: The distribution of fiber strength is no longer strong enough to compete with the elastic redistribution of stress from the soft clamps. The damage development is determined by the elastic forces. The model is then expanded with a gradient in the distribution of fiber strength to induce a clear fracture front. By this we can show that the model reproduces not only both the different roughness exponents ζ+ = 0. 39 and ζ÷ = 1 / 2, but also the dynamic development of the fracture seen in laboratory experiments.

Because of the necessity to design and build lifting structures and equipment of a tremendously high capacity, the demand for high-strength steels usage has been arisen. These steels are to be welded and used in a harsh offshore environment. Localized heating and melting of a workpiece during welding lead to the build-up of residual stresses. When distortion is prevented due to constraints in structures or due to <b>clamping,</b> <b>stress</b> levels will be high and may exceed the yield strength.

40|$|Following the {{development}} of an improved theoretical analysis of fibre pull-out {{on the basis of the}} concept of fracture mechanics in Part II of this paper, the theory has been successfully used to characterize the debonding and frictional pull-out behaviour in cement mortar matrix composites reinforced with steel and glass fibres. It is shown from the plots of partial debond stress, sigma(d) p, versus debond length, l, that these composites are typical of mechanical bonds at the interface. For the steel fibre-cement matrix composites, the theory overestimates the post-debond frictional pull-out stress, sigma(fr), particularly for long embedded fibre length, L, otherwise the prediction agrees well with the experiments for the maximum debond streSS, sigma(d) {*}. This seems to be a direct result of decay of frictional bonds at the interface region after debonding due mainly to compaction of the porous cement mortar surrounding the fibre, effectively reducing the residual <b>clamping</b> <b>stress,</b> q 0, arising from shrinkage of the cement matrix. Therefore, a correct theoretical prediction is made for sigma(fr) using a lower value of q 0 while other parameters are kept constant, which gives good agreement with experimental results. For glass fibre-cement matrix composites, an accelerated cure condition promotes rapid hydration of cement and densification of the matrix. This effectively improves the chemical as well as mechanical bonds at the fibre-matrix interface through the formation of CH crystals and large fibre-solid matrix contact area of the interface, and consequently ameliorating the interfacial properties, interfacial fracture toughness, G(ic) and q 0 in particular. Predictions of sigma(d) {*} and sigma(fr) taking into account these changes due to cure condition, results in good agreement with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Composite {{concrete}} {{consists of}} two elements cast at different times which are the concrete base and concrete topping. To achieve composite action, interface shear strength must be sufficient to resist the sliding motion between the two concrete surfaces in contact. The interface shear strength is mainly depended on concrete cohesion, friction and dowel action. A total of 36 “push-off” tests were performed to study the interface shear strength and to assess the influence of surface texture and steel reinforcement crossing the interface. Three different concrete base surfaces are prepared which include smooth or “left as-cast”, roughened by wire-brushing in the transverse direction and steel reinforcement projecting from the concrete base. Eurocode 2 provides design equations for determining the interface shear strength with different surface textures and also the one where projecting steel reinforcement crosses the interface. The experimental {{results show that the}} transverse roughened surface produced the highest interface shear strength of 1. 89 N/mm 2 (sn = 0 N/mm 2), 4. 69 N/mm 2 (sn = 0. 5 N/mm 2), 5. 97 N/mm 2 (sn = 1. 0 N/mm 2) and 6. 42 N/mm 2 (sn = 1. 5 N/mm 2) compared with the other surface textures. This proves that the increase in the degree of roughness contributes to higher concrete cohesion and friction coefficient. However, for the surface with projecting steel reinforcement, the failure is not sudden as experienced by the surface without one. This is due to the contribution of the <b>clamping</b> <b>stress</b> from the dowel action of the steel reinforcements. Meanwhile, for specimens without any projecting steel reinforcements, the interface shear strength depended solely on friction and concrete cohesion of the surface textures. The interface shear strength of surface with and without the projecting steel reinforcement can be predicted using the Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope. This paper also proposed design expressions for concrete-to-concrete bond on surfaces provided with and without projecting steel reinforcement that can be adopted in Eurocode 2...|$|E

This part of the energy will introduce very high voltage spike on the main switch. A clamp circuit is needed. Passive clamp flyback converter is with few components and effectively <b>clamping</b> the voltage <b>stress</b> on transistor. But its switching frequency is limited by its switching loss. So the transformer volume in passive clamp flyback is very bulky. The aim of this project is to investigate high switching frequency Active Clamp Flyback converter with GaN transistor as power factor correction in lighting application. With the active clamp loop, the leakage inductance energy and snubber loss could be utilized properly to allow ZVS on switches under all line and load conditions and recycled to input source. So high switching frequency and high efficiency are both achievable. In this project,specific control method, dead time length and conduction mode are properly designed for active clamp flyback converter as PFC in lighting application. The implementation of closed control loop is not included. A 50 W (75 V) prototype of active clamp flyback front end converter operation around 1 MHz with GaN transistor as Power Factor Correction stage in lighting application is developed to verify the analysis...|$|R
40|$|Len Lye {{was born}} in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1901. Lye was an avid enthusiast of kinetic {{sculpture}} and experimental film. In 1965 Lye built a prototype for a kinetic sculpture called Blade that he intended would be a much larger work. In 1996, Dr. Shayne Gooch of the University of Canterbury embarked on a research contract that saw the fruition of Lye’s Blade at a scale previously unachieved. This work was given the name Big Blade. This thesis provides a study into the maximum realisable scale of Blade using technology and materials available today. A new pivoting clamp design is tested and assessed using a small scale Blade sculpture built at the University of Canterbury and used as a test rig. Advancements in technology, material availability and manufacturing techniques lead to a comprehensive fatigue study of the new <b>clamp</b> design. <b>Stresses</b> are measured at the critical stress location in the blade material and a new maximum economic scale of Blade is suggested. The new sculpture requires a blade material that measures 10024 mm x 1080 mm x 22 mm. The visible blade length is 8424 mm. The new sculpture is called Giant Blade. A critical aesthetic component for Len Lye’s performance of Blade is the mode shapes formed by the blade material. Specifically, {{the second and third}} bending modes (Lye’s single and double harmonic) and the first torsional bending mode (Lye’s shimmering frequency). These frequencies are calculated using the new pivoting clamp design to ensure that these sections of the performance are maintained in Giant Blade. An important requirement of the new sculpture drive mechanism is the capability to reduce the amplitude of shuttle oscillation dynamically during Blade performances. This capability allows bending stresses in the blade material to be reduced in the third bending mode of vibration without halting the performance to adjust the shuttle oscillation amplitude. Four dynamically adjustable variable stroke mechanisms are presented and compared using the methods of Pahl and Beitz. A suitable mechanism for Giant Blade is selected and a proposed arrangement for the new sculpture is provided. An embodiment design is presented for Giant Blade. This embodiment design consists of a new pivoting clamp design and the proposed variable stroke mechanism. Further work includes the design of a mechanism to support the ball and wand assembly...|$|R
