40|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin Tursiops truncatus is a ubiquitous species {{found throughout the}} temperate and tropical oceans of the world. The {{bottlenose dolphin}} population that occurs in the Shannon {{is one of only}} six known resident European populations. Since 1994, a small dolphin watching industry has been operating in the estuary, with plans for expansion. The objectives of this were to a) assess the degree of residency of bottlenose dolphins in the Shannon; b) estimate the population size and assess the production of calves; c) examine the social structure of the population; d) study habitat use and e) examine the effects of boats on dolphin behaviour. Boat-based surveys and photo-identification techniques were used to derive a population estimate and to examine distribution and movements of individually identifiable dolphins over a two-year period. Land-based scan samples were used to examine behavioural activity and interactions of dolphins with all categories of boat traffic. Trips on dolphin watching boats examined whether these boats were interacting with the same individual dolphins on a trip, daily or weekly basis. Dolphins were recorded in all months of the year but with a seasonal peak between May and September. Many of the identifiable dolphins were resighted throughout the study indicating a high degree of residency. Using photo-identification and mark-recapture analyses, the population estimate for the Shannon is 113 dolphins (CV 0. 14, 95 % C. I. 94 - 161). The presence of neonatal calves only from July – September indicates that there is a marked breeding season for this population and that the area is important as a nursery area. Group sizes ranged from singletons to groups of 32 animals and while dolphins were seen throughout the study area, groups were frequently encountered in the narrow water at Kilcredaun and in the mouth of the estuary. A second area of concentrated sightings was identified further up-river around Moneypoint and Tarbert/Killimer. This group comprised a smaller number of individuals, and the re-encounter rate of these individuals in the same area suggests a degree of habitat partitioning. These dolphins may be more vulnerable to dolphin watching activities than the more diffuse numbers in the outer estuary. The influence of tidal cycle was recorded at Kilcredaun and at Killimer/Tarbert with a distinct peak in sightings in the four-hour period before low tide. The frequency distribution of association indices shows that there are few "strong" associations between individuals and supports the notion of a fluid and gregarious social structure. Dolphin watching boats were involved in 61. 8 % of all interactions with dolphin groups, higher than any other <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>boat.</b> At present, two operators make approximately 200 dolphin watching trips annually, carrying a total of 2, 400 passengers per year. The operators are highly successful in locating dolphins (97 %) and the tour boats rarely come into contact with each other on the water and generally search in different areas and watch different groups. The potential for land-based dolphin watching was examined and possible sites identified. The information from this study provides a basis from which sound conservation management strategies can be developed, in order to properly conserve the species and its habitat, to develop a sustainable dolphin watching industry and to develop/monitor other coastal zone industries such as oil and gas exploration and shipping development within the Shannon.

40|$|Research PaperPresent {{resource}} rents in Norway's fisheries {{were compared}} for different fleet structures. Alternative values of TACs were assumed, {{which is consistent}} with how most fisheries in Norwegian waters are managed. Total allowable catches (TACs) are set on the basis of advice by fisheries biologists where the economics of the industry plays a minor role. The TAC is then shared between the nations sharing the fish stocks, according to agreed formulas. A model of the fisheries was implemented in GAMS. The basis for the model is fleet categorization used in the annual cost and earnings studies. Rents were maximized using an LP-approach, under various constraints regarding divisions of the total catches between different fleet categories. Currently the resource rent in Norway's fisheries is small and possibly even negative, depending on assumptions made with regard to capital costs and other uncertain factors. The potential rent is quite high and could be up to one half of the landed value, depending on constraints with regard to reallocation of fish catches between different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>boats,</b> and also on assumptions about capital costs and other uncertain factors. In some fisheries in Norway it is now permitted to trade in fish quotas through trading in fishing vessels. Vessels can be removed from the fishery and stripped of their quotas, which then are transferred to other vessels. As the fleet categories involved have undergone downsizing their profitability has increased and the value of the fish quotas has gone up. Data from the cost and earnings studies were used to estimate the value of fish quotas and to study whether they reflect resource rent in the fishery. Transaction value of these fish quotas in many cases seem to overestimate the resource rent in the fishery, probably due to excess capacity in the existing fleet...|$|R
40|$|The most {{pressing}} concerns associated with conservation {{of the endangered}} Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) include habitat alteration and mortality caused by humans. Whereas considerable {{research has focused on}} manatee mortality associated with watercraft collisions, little {{attention has been paid to}} the impacts of noise created by watercraft. Potential effects of environmental noise on the habitat selection, distribution, and behavior of manatees are the foci of this dissertation, the primary goal of which was to understand and predict manatee behavior patterns as a function of environmental noise levels in the Sarasota Bay area. Manatee behavior was examined in terms of: (1) habitat selection and distribution, (2) activity budget, (3) vocalization usage, and (4) short-term response to playbacks of approaching watercraft. ^ The initial phase of the study used acoustic modeling and monitoring to relate transmission loss and noise levels in specific manatee habitats to animal distribution. High-use grassbeds were quieter than low-use grassbeds of equal species composition and density, indicating a correlation between manatee distribution and environmental noise levels. In the morning the presence <b>of</b> <b>boats</b> and their associated noise may also play a dominant role in the timing of grassbed usage. ^ The degree to which manatees alter their patterns of behavior and vocalization under different environmental noise levels was investigated in the observation phase of the study. Results indicated that elevated environmental noise levels correlate with the overall activity budget of this species. More time was spent in the directed, goal-oriented behaviors of feeding and traveling whereas less time was spent milling when noise levels were highest. When noise levels were elevated, manatees increased their call duration during feeding and milling behaviors, suggesting that ambient noise levels have a detectable effect on manatee communication and that manatees modify their vocalizations as a function of noise. ^ Manatee response to the playback <b>of</b> an approaching <b>boat</b> was assessed in the final phase of the study. Results indicated that manatees respond differentially to different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>boat</b> noise used in the playback study. The most pronounced responses to boat noise playbacks, relative to the controls, were elicited by personal watercraft. ...|$|R
5000|$|Drag boat {{racing is}} a form of drag racing which takes place on water rather than land. As with {{land-based}} drag racing, competitors race their vehicles for the lowest elapsed time (low ET) over a straight race course of a defined length. There are three standard drag race course lengths, 660 feet (1/8 mile), 1,320 foot (1/4 mile), and the most common length, used in professional drag boat racing, 1,000 feet (3/16 mile plus 10 feet). Unlike drag racing on land, which begins from a standing start, drag boat racing begins from a short rolling start to a point that cannot be passed until the green [...] "start" [...] light illuminates.

40|$|This is a {{qualitative}} case study about tourists and boat migrants in movement to and {{in place on}} the Canary Islands, Spain. The aim is to study how these two groups of guests are treated differently, either as guests or strangers, based on how they move, illegally or legally, {{where they come from}} and where they have rights to go. To analyze the case I use theories of how differences in ethnicity, culture and religion etc. are created and recreated in society in interactions among humans and in the politics - the politics of difference. The politics of difference creates and recreates <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> mobility such as tourists and boat migrants. Scholars as Michael Azar, Nikolas Rose and Tim Cresswell mean that the politics of difference, which involve control, division, exclusion and unequal distribution of resources, are violent processes. The recreation and the maintenance <b>of</b> the different <b>categories,</b> tourist and boat migrant, show violent actions both in the movements of the groups and the treatment on place. Therefore the problem researched shows how these violent actions of the politics of difference manifest themselves in creating and recreating the <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> tourist and <b>boat</b> migrant. In analyzing the violence I use the theory of Johan Galtung. He defines violence as assaults against basic human needs divided in structural and direct violence. In the case <b>of</b> tourists and <b>boat</b> migrants the politics of difference affect several aspects of needs such as survival, freedom, identity and meaning and wellbeing. In the perspective of the tourist the structural violence is natural because of its contribution to the stability of society while the violence becomes direct to the needs <b>of</b> the <b>boat</b> migrant. This shows how the politics of difference neglect the human rights in practice...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{examination}} of dory building in the Bay of Islands in western Newfoundland using the analytical <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> design, construction, and use. Tradition and culture are separated to show how culture, the time specific part <b>of</b> <b>boat</b> building, operates within tradition, the components <b>of</b> <b>boat</b> building which persist through time. This study explores the significance of dory use and how the information gained by the builder through use may influence change in design, and therefore, construction. [...] Most of the material presented came from data collected in interviews with the area's boat builders who received their training from other builders. The boat types, which have been built and used in the area, have changed greatly over time. At first, original settlers brought boats with them {{from other parts of}} Newfoundland and then altered them upon reaching the Bay of Islands. After living there for about one hundred years the economic and technological contexts changed and fishermen and boat builders looked to a different boat design to meet the requirements of the change. At this point, the dory became the central focus <b>of</b> <b>boat</b> building activities. [...] Once it was evident that the dory would become the new boat for the area, builders began to experiment with design and construction in response to these environmental changes. During the past fifty years, the dory has developed from a row dory into an outboard powered dory used for lobster fishing, the mainstay of most inshore fishermen of the area. Dory development in the Bay of Islands took place within the confines of tradition, culture, personal expectations and innovation. While the tradition <b>of</b> <b>boat</b> building has remained in the area, it has undergone cultural changes in the form <b>of</b> the <b>boat</b> in which the tradition is manifested...|$|R
