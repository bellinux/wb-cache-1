50|$|There are no {{biological}} control agents {{that have been}} specifically released for <b>cotton</b> <b>thistle</b> control in the United States. A thistle head weevil Rhinocyllus conicus that feeds on Carduus pycnocephalus {{has also been shown}} to feed on <b>cotton</b> <b>thistle.</b> This insect was the object of imprudent {{biological control}} introduction, and it became an invasive species that has threatened endangered native thistles in North America (Strong 1997). Establishment of this thistle head weevil as a biological control agent for <b>cotton</b> <b>thistle</b> has been unsuccessful in the Pacific Northwest. A thistle crown weevil (Trichosirocalus horridus) that feeds on musk, bull, plumeless, Italian, and creeping thistles will also feed on <b>cotton</b> <b>thistle.</b> In Australia, this insect has been shown to kill <b>cotton</b> <b>thistle</b> rosettes. The related Trichosirocalus briese is also being tested as a control agent. The Australian painted lady butterfly has been known to use this invasive species as a host plant, but the larvae do not do enough damage to the plant for this butterfly to be used as biological control agent.|$|E

50|$|A {{combination}} of methods (IPM) {{is often more}} effective than any single method. An integrated pest management plan deals with prevention as well as control. Eradication of weed species is often not a practical goal, {{but in many cases}} reducing infestation to manageable levels is an achievable objective. Seed bank longevity is a major factor in managing <b>cotton</b> <b>thistles.</b> Re-establishing competitive perennial grasses and monitoring infested areas on a yearly basis is critical. Herbicides can successfully be used for reducing thistle populations and giving grasses a competitive advantage, but they cannot be used as a stand-alone solution. These techniques must be linked with good grazing practices in rangeland areas. Otherwise, the thistles will recolonize and rapidly replenish the seed bank to pre-control levels.|$|R
40|$|For {{pesticides}} {{to effectively}} manage pests, they {{must first be}} deposited on the target (typically a plant surface) in a {{manner in which the}} active ingredient(s) can be readily taken up by the target organism. A plant architectural model that enables the location of various plant components in 3 -D space combined with a particle trajectory model has been used to study the interception of spray droplets by various vegetative elements. Results from the simulation are compared with wind tunnel studies of glyphosate deposition on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. var. Sicala), sow thistle (Sonchus oleraceus L.) and wild oats (Avena ludoviciana Durieu). An air induction flat fan nozzle (AI 110015 at 500 kPa pressure) and an extended range flat fan nozzle (XR 11002 at 280 kPa pressure) were predicted to have similar glyphosate deposition on <b>cotton</b> and sow <b>thistle</b> plants, whereas the extended range nozzle resulted in higher deposit on wild oats. Spray deposition (µg cm- 2) on wild oat plants at the 5 -leaf stage was more than double the amount of deposition on sow thistle or wild oat plants at the 2 -leaf stage. The model was in good agreement with the experimental data except that it tended to over predict deposition on sow thistle plants...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{placement}} of pesticide droplets on to crop and weed surfaces {{is a key}} step in controlling pests and weeds in agricultural production systems. Droplets impact on plant surfaces, depositing pesticides that give protective coverage on crops and destructive coverage for insect or fungi pests and weeds. Coverage is complex and is determined by a multitude of interactions between factors such as size and density of spray droplets, relative humidity and turbulence of the air through which the droplets travel, and the physical characteristics of the target plant leaves, branches and stems that go {{to make up the}} architecture of their canopy. There are, however, concerns over the effect of pesticides on the environment and public health. This thesis combines three dimensional (3 -D) computer modelling techniques, physical measurements of droplet movement and impact on a canopy in a wind tunnel and risk management techniques to maximise the effectiveness of pesticides and enable risks to {{public health and the environment}} from agricultural spraying activities to be minimised. L-studio, a Windows based software environment for creating simulation models of plant architecture was used in this study. A particle trajectory model, based on the combined ballistic and random-walk approach proposed by Mokeba et al. (1997) and Cox et al. (2000) was used to model spray droplet movement. Algorithms were included in the spray model to account for evaporation of droplets, entrained air and movement of air around the spray, collection efficiency, and droplet splash. Existing functional-structural plant models of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and sow thistle (Sonchus oleraceus L.) and a static empirical model of immature grass weeds have been combined with the spray model. An environmental program has been used to take the location of the leaves in 3 -D space from the plant model and determine if spray droplets will impact on them. Wind tunnel measurements were made to determine initial droplet properties (droplet size, velocity, trajectory, density and fluid properties) and droplet impact characteristics (retention and splash). The results from these measurements were then used to define parameters within the spray model. Additional experiments to measure spray drift and spray deposition on various plant surfaces within the wind tunnel were used to evaluate the combined spray and plant architecture model. The combined spray and plant architectural model developed and evaluated in this thesis has provided a new method to study the influence of plant architecture on spray distribution. This work has shown that 3 -D plant architecture can influence the amount of spray depositing on leaf surfaces. Deposition on plant surfaces was also found to increase with decreased wind speed and reduced release height. Droplet size did not have a significant influence on spray deposition onto broadleaf plants such as <b>cotton</b> or sow <b>thistle.</b> There was however, a tendency for fine sprays to give a higher deposit on small, narrow grass leaves. Spray drift was found to increase with decreasing droplet size, increasing the range of droplet sizes generated by a nozzle, decreasing sheet velocity (initial velocity of droplets), increasing wind speed, increasing (difference between dry and wet bulb temperature), decreasing liquid density and increasing release height. The combined spray and architectural model has also enabled the study of how effects such as droplet splash and retention can influence the distribution of the spray. In this study it was found that there was little difference in modelled spray drift, amount of spray on the ground or amount of spray on the cotton plant between situations where most droplets splash on impact and where no droplet splash on impact. Although the total amount of spray retained on the plant surface was similar for both situations, it was found that there were more droplets on the plant under the splash scenario leading to better coverage of the spray over the plant. These results indicate that the majority of the smaller splash droplets were re-distributed onto other parts of the plant rather than becoming lost as spray drift or ground deposit. Decision trees have been used in this thesis to characterise the benefits and risks from pesticide applications. Results from model simulations and/or physical measurements are used to estimate the relative proportion of the spray depositing on plant surfaces, depositing on the ground and drifting away from the treatment area. These deposition results give a measure of pesticide exposure that can be incorporated into the risk management framework to investigate the influence of various application scenarios. The applicability of this approach is shown by the example of endosulfan sprayed on cotton to control Helicoverpa spp. The decision tree model can be used to quickly compare different scenarios, such as deciding which application method should be used. It can be used to effectively aid spray decisions to maximise the effectiveness of pesticides and minimise risks to public health and the environment from agricultural spraying activities...|$|R

50|$|In Europe, {{the plant}} tends to {{colonise}} disturbed pastures.

50|$|Onopordum acanthium (<b>cotton</b> <b>thistle,</b> Scotch thistle) is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and Western Asia from the Iberian Peninsula east to Kazakhstan, and north to central Scandinavia, and widely naturalised elsewhere. It is a vigorous biennial plant with coarse, spiny leaves and conspicuous spiny-winged stems.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} shorter life cycle, <b>cotton</b> <b>thistle</b> plants can be {{effectively}} treated with herbicides. All herbicide treatments {{should be applied}} at the rosette stage of the plant. Generally, herbicide applications would be in early spring or autumn. One of the primary difficulties in chemical control of cotton thistles is their ability to germinate nearly year round. From autumn to spring a range of plant sizes can be found which may result in variable success from chemical control. Herbicides are very effective on seedlings and young rosettes, but control becomes more variable with increasing plant age. Onopordum spp. seeds may persist for several years in the soil. Buried seed may persist for up to twenty years, and reinfestation is likely without yearly management. Therefore, several years of re-treatment may be necessary. Picloram, dicamba, 2,4-D, dicamba + 2,4,-D, and metsulfuron are effective for controlling <b>Cotton</b> <b>Thistle.</b> Clopyralid is more selective for controlling plants in the Asteraceae family, but will also injure or kill legumes.|$|E
50|$|The {{common name}} of <b>cotton</b> <b>thistle</b> {{derives from the}} cotton-like hairs on the leaves. Other names include Scots thistle or Scottish thistle, heraldic thistle and woolly thistle. The name Scots thistle comes from the flower used as the {{national}} emblem of Scotland. Despite its name, {{it has nothing to}} do with the actual thistle that is used as the emblem of Scotland is the Cirsium vulgare.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cotton</b> <b>thistle</b> is {{native to}} Europe and Asia. The plant prefers {{habitats}} with dry summers, such as the Mediterranean region, growing best in sandy, sandy clay and calcareous soils which are rich in ammonium salts. It grows in ruderal places, as well as dry pastures and disturbed fields. Its preferred habitats are natural areas, disturbed sites, roadsides, fields, and especially sites with fertile soils, agricultural areas, range/grasslands, riparian zones, scrub/shrublands valleys and plains along with water courses. Temperature and moisture, rather than soil nutrient concentrations, determine the ecological performance of Onopordum species.|$|E
5000|$|The {{black-headed bunting}} {{is found in}} flocks as it forages on grasslands for seeds. They breed in summer, {{building}} a nest in a low bush or on the ground. The nest is a cup made of dry grass and lined with hair. The clutch consists of four to six eggs. The eggs hatch after about 13 days and the chicks fledge after about 10 days. Its natural food consists of insects when feeding young, and otherwise seeds. In Bulgaria, {{the collapse of the}} drying <b>cotton</b> <b>thistle</b> (Onopordum acanthium) stems on which the birds build their nests has caused high mortality; this is thought to be an example of an ecological trap. In northern Iran, there is a region of range overlap with the red-headed bunting and natural hybrids are common although molecular data indicates that there is considerable genetic divergence between the two species.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, it was {{introduced}} to temperate regions of North America, South America, and Australia as an ornamental plant, and is now considered a major agricultural and wildland noxious weed. It has been recorded from nearly 50 countries. It is difficult to eradicate because of its drought resistance. It can spread rapidly and eventually dense stands prohibit foraging by livestock. Infestations of <b>cotton</b> <b>thistle</b> often start in disturbed areas such as roadways, campsites, burned areas, and ditch banks. The weed adapts best to areas along rivers and streams, but can be a serious problem in pastures, grain fields and range areas. A single plant is imposing enough, but an entire colony can ruin a pasture or destroy a park or campsite, sometimes forming tall, dense, impenetrable stands. Besides creating an impenetrable barrier to humans and animals, the plant nearly eliminates forage use by livestock and some mammal species such as deer and elk.|$|E
50|$|According to a legend, an invading Norse {{army was}} {{attempting}} to sneak up at night upon a Scottish army's encampment. During this operation one barefoot Norseman had the misfortune to step upon a thistle, causing him to cry out in pain, thus alerting Scots {{to the presence of}} the Norse invaders. Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the Battle of Largs, which {{marked the beginning of the}} departure of King Haakon IV (Haakon the Elder) of Norway who, having control of the Northern Isles and Hebrides, had harried the coast of the Kingdom of Scotland for some years. Which species of thistle is referred to in the original legend is disputed. Popular modern usage favours <b>cotton</b> <b>thistle</b> (Onopordum acanthium), perhaps because of its more imposing appearance, though it is unlikely to have occurred in Scotland in mediaeval times; the spear thistle (Cirsium vulgare), an abundant native species in Scotland, is a more likely candidate. Other species, including dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule), musk thistle (Carduus nutans), and melancholy thistle (Cirsium heterophyllum) have also been suggested.|$|E
50|$|Again on 15 August 1940, {{in spite}} of the {{assembly}} ban imposed by the Nazis then occupying the city and the presence of many armed soldiers, nothing could prevent the citizens of Metz from showing their devotion to Our Lady of Metz and demonstrating their patriotic attachment to France. They gathered silently on the jam-packed square. The statue was surrounded by flowers in the three colors of France and a huge Cross of Lorraine embellished with thistles and a ribbon in yellow and red, the colours of Lorraine, was attached to the column on which the motto of Lorraine could be read: Qui s'y frotte s'y pique (who rubs himself on it pricks himself on it), a reference to the <b>cotton</b> <b>thistle,</b> the symbol of Lorraine. Suddenly in the silent crowd a chant began: Reine de France - Priez pour nous - Notre espérance - Venez et sauvez-nous (Queen of France - Pray for us - Our hope - Come and save us), and was taken up immediately by all the faithful present. The chant was started by Sister Helen Studler, a Daughter of Charity, who had the courage to express her desire to see the tricolor flag of France waving again in Metz. The crowd then returned to the cathedral in silence and many spent the whole night in prayer.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the healing {{properties}} of a medicinal plant {{commonly used in}} Iran, Onopordon acanthium known as <b>cotton</b> <b>thistle</b> was investigated. This plant {{has been used in}} the traditional Iranian medicine, as an aid in the treatment of wounds. In order to access which part of this plant contained the principle ingredient(s), hydroalcoholic extract of the roots, stems, leaves and flowers were separately prepared. The extracts were formulated into an eucerin-based ointment and applied once daily to a full thickness excision wound (2 x 2 cm) inflicted on the mid-dorsal area of White Newzealand rabbit. Measurement of the wound surface area was employed as the parameter by which the effectiveness of each preparation was assessed. The wound areas were traced on transparencies and the areas were quantified by placing the transparency film over graph paper and counting the squares. Compared with other extracts, the results showed that the hydroalcoholic extract from the flowers is the most effective. Dose-response curves showed that 0. 2 % w/w flowers extract has the optimum concentration which induced the fastest rate of healing, inducing a complete healing in 6 days compared with 17 days with the ointment base alone. The results suggest that this extract is an effective preparation in the treatment of wounds in this model...|$|E
40|$|As is {{the case}} {{elsewhere}} in the world, Turkish people have long utilized plants as remedies, food, fuel, and dye, {{as well as for}} furniture, ornamentation, agricultural tools, and construction materials. Onopordum is a valuable medicinal plant that is widely used in traditional medicine in Europe. The application of Onopordum as food is limited and its main importance is due to medicine utilization. Because of having flavonoid compositions, Onopordum is an important plant. The Genus Onopordum L. (Asteraceae) includes about 38 species. The representatives of the genus are native to Europe, Northern Africa, the Canary Island, the Caucasus, Southwest and Central Asia. In Turkey, this genus is represented with 20 species, 6 of which are endemic. Onopordum (<b>cotton</b> <b>thistle,</b> also known as Scots or Scotch thistle) species are biennials herbaceous plants with branched, spinose winged stems. They have application in medical practice as a bactericide, cardiotonic, and hemostatic agent and are used against hypotonicity. In this study antioxidant activities of ethanol, methanol, acetone and benzen extracts of some endemic Onopordum anatolicum (Boiss.) Boiss. & Heldr. ex Eig seeds which are in Denizli were examined. DPPH and β-carotene-Linoleic acid methods were used in order to determinethe antioxidant activity. The highest antioxidant activity (77 %) was seenin the extract which is obtained by using methanol catalyst. The lowest activity of antioxidant of the extracts is acetone (5 %). In terms of impact, the strenght of antioxidant depends on the phenolic amount of it. For that purpose, O. anatolicum total fenolic content was calculated in terms of mg/ml gallic acid in the experiment performed by using Folin-Ciocaltaeu medhod. According to these values, the highest amount of phenolic compounds are in methanol and the lowest amount of phenolic compounds are in benzen. According to the results of the experiment performed by using DPPH method, {{it is obvious that the}} free radicals in the environment has theability of sweep. The increase in the concentration of all extracts leads to an increase in the activity of elimination of free radical...|$|E
