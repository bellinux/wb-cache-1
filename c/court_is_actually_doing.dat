40|$|Liberals must {{acknowledge}} a {{dirty little secret}} about American constitutional law; a secret that the Warren Court made apparent, though it had existed from the day John Marshall asserted the power of judicial review in a Constitution that says nothing about it. The secret {{is that there is}} no serious theory explaining or justifying what courts <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> when they strike down a statute as unconstitutional. The Warren years were enormously important in moving the country forward. I do not know what we would have done without the wisdom and courage of the Court. But when you start looking for jurisprudential theory to explain what it was that the Warren <b>Court</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>doing</b> when it re-wrote most of American constitutional law, and what it has been doing during the Rehnquist and Roberts Court 2 ̆ 7 s attempted counter-reformation, when it re-wrote the rest, it is clear that there is neither textual support in the Constitution, nor a consensus political theory, that justifies much of judicial review...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{rendition of}} Belgian {{law does not}} list disgorgement as a remedy. In reality, however, disgorgement is ordered in certain circumstances, but it is generally not recognized as such. For example, case law on personality rights and intellectual property rights contains examples where courts, {{under the banner of}} loss compensation, in fact set damages at a level higher than the actual losses to force the wrongdoer to hand over his profits. Also, non-compliance penalties are set at a level to provide an incentive to obey a court order, requiring the amount to be equal to the profits that can be made by ignoring the order. On the other hand, some instances of primary proprietary rights to profits can alternatively be understood as examples of disgorgement as a remedy for infringements of rights. Examples are the right of an owner to the fruits a male fide possessor realizes from his property and the right of the solvens to the income the bad faith accipiens has earned from an undue payment. In the view of the national reporter, Belgian private law apparently includes a (hidden) general principle that gives the holder of a subjective right a claim for disgorgement of profits realized by another person who in bad faith infringed the exclusive authority of the rightholder. This general principle has not (yet) been explicitly recognized by the courts, but it helps to understand what <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> <b>doing</b> in cases that cannot be explained under standard rules of civil liability...|$|R
40|$|In South Africa {{there are}} no models of court {{interpreting}} {{to serve as a}} guide for court interpreters when performing their task. This is because there is no proper definition of the role of a court interpreter. Models of court interpreting define and describe the process by stating what <b>court</b> interpreters <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> <b>doing</b> when carrying out their task. The absence of these models presents challenges to South African court interpreters as they are expected to follow international models which are formulated culturally, using English metaphorical language which differs from that of indigenous South African languages. As a result, the metaphorical language is likely to be misinterpreted by South African court interpreters as English is not their first language. The application of international models is likely to cause challenges when applied in the South African context, hence the need to formulate models of court interpreting which {{can be applied to the}} South African linguistic context. The study follows a qualitative research approach and uses multifaceted theoretical frameworks, namely descriptive translation studies (DTS), cognitive process analysis, and content analysis in collecting and analysing the data. </p...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{reviews the}} history of the right to present a defense and closely {{examines}} the United States Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s modern analysis of that right. Part III analyzes the emergence of the right to present a defense that a third party committed the crime and concludes with a discussion of the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent decision in South Carolina v. Holmes. Part IV then describes the current restrictive implementation of the wrong-person defense by the lower courts. Part V argues that the constitutional right to present a wrong-person defense is being insufficiently protected under current, arbitrary standards, and prescribes a constitutional analysis of the defense that is consistent with the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence, more reflective of what the lower <b>courts</b> <b>actually</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing,</b> and that is likely to produce more reliable results...|$|R
