500|$|The typical GMAW {{welding gun}} {{has a number}} of key partsa control switch, a <b>contact</b> <b>tip,</b> a power cable, a gas nozzle, an {{electrode}} conduit and liner, and a gas hose. The control switch, or trigger, when pressed by the operator, initiates the wire feed, electric power, and the shielding gas flow, causing an electric arc to be struck. The <b>contact</b> <b>tip,</b> normally made of copper and sometimes chemically treated to reduce spatter, is connected to the welding power source through the power cable and transmits the electrical energy to the electrode while directing it to the weld area. [...] It must be firmly secured and properly sized, since it must allow the electrode to pass while maintaining electrical contact. On the way to the <b>contact</b> <b>tip,</b> the wire is protected and guided by the electrode conduit and liner, which help prevent buckling and maintain an uninterrupted wire feed. The gas nozzle directs the shielding gas evenly into the welding zone. Inconsistent flow may not adequately protect the weld area. Larger nozzles provide greater shielding gas flow, which is useful for high current welding operations that develop a larger molten weld pool. [...] A gas hose from the tanks of shielding gas supplies the gas to the nozzle. Sometimes, a water hose is also built into the welding gun, cooling the gun in high heat operations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cu-Cr contact {{material}} {{is used in}} medium voltage, high current vacuum interrupters. Vacuum interrupter {{is the heart of}} Vacuum Circuit breaker. <b>Contact</b> <b>tips</b> are usually made using powder metallurgical techniques in disk shape. These disks are machined to required dimensions and then hermitically sealed by vacuum brazing. The properties of the final <b>contact</b> <b>tips</b> are thus usually rarely studied. In the present study the properties before and after the vacuum sealing are compared in order to establish a correlation between them. The Cu-Cr <b>contact</b> <b>tips</b> were made under different compaction pressures, sintering temperatures and soaking time periods. Cu-Cr contacts were prepared by powder processing route and sintering in vacuum furnace at the temperatures of 1050 °C for different soaking time period of 4, 6 and 8 Hrs. The samples were then subjected to simulated sealing cycle at temperatures (870 and 960 ºC). The electrical conductivity, hardness, microstructure and grain morphology of all the samples were studied. Properties of as-sintered and after sealing were analyzed and compared. The results of quantitative microscopy shows the better result on sintered sample soaked for 4 Hrs. The hardness and conductivity of the heat treated sample and without heat treated has been correlated with microstructure. 1. Introduction: Vacuu...|$|R

50|$|The {{combustion}} chamber is {{in two parts}} and is normally open to the atmosphere. When the <b>contact</b> <b>tip</b> is pushed onto a piece of work, the lower piston chamber (which also serves as the piston bore) is pushed into the upper part, sealing it. Simultaneously, a metered amount of fuel is squirted into the chamber from the fuel cell.

A small amount of combustion gas is briefly stored in a side chamber and is used to push the piston back into the ready position after the nail is driven.|$|E

30|$|In particular, a mushroom-like {{structure}} exhibited strong adhesive {{behavior by}} equalizing the stress distribution at a <b>contact</b> <b>tip</b> [15 – 19]. In contrast, an asymmetric stress distribution lowers the detachment force. When a tangential force is applied, a moment is {{generated in the}} structure and the stress at the contact area is asymmetrically distributed. The stress at the contact edge increases with the applied moment until the stress is reached {{at which point the}} detachment occurs [20]. Hence, the detachment force decreases when the moment increases, and the control of the moment is an important factor for the reversible attachment and detachment processes. The detachment mechanism of straight beam adhesive devices has been investigated by analyzing the stress distribution at the <b>contact</b> <b>tip</b> [21 – 23].|$|E

GMAW-CMT welding was carried out on 5 mm and 6 mm thick AA 6351 plates. An experimental test was conducted at different level welding speed, <b>contact</b> <b>tip</b> to work distance and material thickness. There are several equipment that had been utilized in order to execute the work such as magnifying glass, vision measuring machine, MG- 8 cam gauge, Insize weld gauge, Mahr Marsuft XR 20 surface roughness machine, S- 72 cleaner remover, 222 dye penetrant, LD- 3 developer, NortecB 500 series portable eddy current flaw detector and surface p~obe. The visual inspection, weld bead measurement, surface roughness and waviness measurement, dye penetration testing and eddy current testing have been performed to assess the weld characteristic of AA 6351 joints. The results of weld bead width, weld bead height, surface roughness and waviness were analyzed using Minitab 16 software. The results indicated that welding speed, <b>contact</b> <b>tip</b> to work distance and material thickness significantly affected the weld bead width, weld bead height, surface roughness and waviness.

40|$|AbstractFibrous surface {{structures}} {{can improve}} the adhesion of objects to other surfaces. Animals, such as flies and geckos, {{take advantage of this}} principle by developing “hairy” contact structures which ensure controlled and repeatable adhesion and detachment. Mathematical models for fiber adhesion predict pronounced dependencies of contact performance on the geometry and the elastic properties of the fibers. In this paper the limits of such contacts imposed by fiber strength, fiber condensation, compliance, and ideal contact strength are modeled for spherical <b>contact</b> <b>tips.</b> Based on this, we introduce the concept of “adhesion design maps” which visualize the predicted mechanical behavior. The maps are useful for understanding biological systems and for guiding experimentation to achieve optimum artificial contacts...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{improved}} conductive-mode {{atomic force microscopy}} (C-AFM) method by modulating the applied loading force on the <b>tip.</b> Unreliable electrical <b>contact</b> and <b>tip</b> wear are the primary challenges for electrical characterization at the nanometer scale. The experiments show that force modulation reduces tip wear {{by a factor of}} three and enhances electrical <b>contact</b> between <b>tip</b> and sample, which allows operation at lower loading force and further reduction of tip and sample wear. Long-term wear experiments with platinum silicide tips on phase change media (Ge 8 Sb 2 Te 11) show a nine and two times higher conductance for loading forces of 10 and 20 nN, respectively. The proposed technique could be of significant importance in applications such as probe storage and metrology, as long-term, reliable conduction in C-AFM remains a challenge...|$|R

30|$|Detachment {{occurs when}} the maximum stress at the <b>contact</b> <b>tip</b> overcomes the {{limiting}} stress for adhesion. Although the asymmetric dependence of the normal and tangential forces at the detachment can be obtained with a tilted beam structure, the beam tip shape also affects this dependence. In the case of tips with heel elongation, the overall detachment force increased compared with straight tip structures. In the case of tips with toe elongation, {{the intensity of the}} detachment force on the pulling angle and its asymmetry differed from those of the other samples. These findings demonstrate that the anisotropic friction behavior of oblique beam arrays can be enhanced by tuning the geometry of the beam tips.|$|E
