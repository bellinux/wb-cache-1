2500|$|King {{considered}} {{raising children}} {{in a society that}} discriminated against them serious, and spoke against her husband whenever the two disagreed on financial needs of their family. The Kings had four children; Yolanda, Martin III, Dexter and Bernice. All four children later followed in their parents' footsteps as civil rights activists.

2500|$|In April 1971, Abagnale {{reportedly}} {{escaped from}} the Federal Detention <b>Center</b> <b>in</b> <b>Atlanta,</b> Georgia, while awaiting trial. In his book, Abagnale considers this {{to be one of}} the most infamous escapes in history. During the time, U.S. prisons were being condemned by civil rights groups and investigated by congressional committees. In a stroke of luck that included the accompanying U.S. marshal forgetting his detention commitment papers, Abagnale was mistaken for an undercover prison inspector and was even given privileges and food far better than the other inmates. The Federal Department of Corrections in Atlanta had already lost two employees as a result of reports written by undercover federal agents and Abagnale took advantage of their vulnerability. He contacted a friend (called in his book [...] "Jean Sebring") who posed as his fiancée and slipped him the business card of [...] "Inspector C.W. Dunlap" [...] of the Bureau of Prisons, which she had obtained by posing as a freelance writer doing an article on fire safety measures in federal detention centers. She also handed over a business card from [...] "Sean O'Riley" [...] (later revealed to be Joseph Shea), the FBI agent in charge of Abagnale's case, which she doctored at a stationery print shop. Abagnale told the corrections officers that he was indeed a prison inspector and handed over Dunlap's business card as proof. He told them that he needed to contact FBI Agent Sean O'Riley on a matter of urgent business.|$|E
