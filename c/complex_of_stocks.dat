40|$|Squid {{are among}} the {{fastest-growing}} short-lived commercial species and, as opposed to most finfish resources worldwide, their contribution to the total world fish production has been increasing at a high rate in the two last decades. Also, since squids tend to have higher global market values than many fish, they {{have the potential to}} produce both larger and more valuable catches, given the same level of primary productivity. As annuals, ommastrephid squid, like those in the genus Illex used as an example in this volume, grow rapidly with high production to biomass ratios, but have no reserves of genetic diversity once a year class is overfished. Thus, detailed understanding of stock structure and highly variable recruitment dynamics is required to ensure conservation of the resource base and achieve sustainability of directed fisheries. Increment analysis for age and growth, and stomach content analysis, indicate flexible seasonality and feeding strategies allowing a wide range of habitats. I. coindetii occupies the Mediterranean, Caribbean and eastern Atlantic margin from 55 °N to 20 °S but never sustains major fisheries. In the western boundary currents of the Atlantic, I. illecebrosus collapsed after intense, widely distributed fishing in the north, while, in the south, I. argentinus has survived much longer as the world's largest squid fishery, possibly stabilized by a <b>complex</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks,</b> with widely dispersed breeding in space and time. Selective gears in feeding areas may be self-limiting, so long as migration ensures adequate escapement and the squid are not pursued into breeding areas. Recruitment appears to be limited by food production and by instabilities in the interactions between adult migrations and ocean physics, which strongly influence early growth and survival. After chapters reviewing the principal commercial species of Illex, both techniques and results of studies on these influencing factors are reported in separate chapters by experts in their fields...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} co-movement pattern <b>of</b> 67 <b>stock</b> market indices {{in the past}} 5 years. In order to capture the <b>complex</b> {{interaction}} <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> markets, we propose a network approach to analyze the interdependence <b>of</b> the individual <b>stock</b> markets.

We reveal the structure dynamics <b>of</b> global <b>stock</b> market integration by examining the variation of the network parameters as time elapses. We show that global stock markets have time-varying synchronization, and that developed markets tend to demonstrate stronger integration while emerging markets are statistically independent of each other.

Latitudinal {{distribution}} and structure {{along the coast}} The coastal morphotype is continuously distributed along the Atlantic coast south of Long Island, around peninsula Florida and along the Gulf of Mexico coast. On the basis of differences in mtDNA haplotype frequencies, however, Curry (1997) concluded that the nearshore animals in the northern Gulf of Mexico and the western North Atlantic were significantly different and represent separate stocks. Within the western North Atlantic, the <b>stock</b> structure <b>of</b> coastal bottlenose dolphins is complex. Scott et al. (1988) hypothesized a single coastal migratory stock ranging seasonally from {{as far north as}} Long Island, NY, to as far south as central Florida, citing stranding patterns during a high mortality event in 1987 - 88 and observed density patterns along the US Atlantic coast. The continuous distribution of dolphins along the coast seemed to support this hypothesis. It was recognized that bottlenose dolphins were resident in some estuaries; these were considered to be separate from the coastal migratory animals.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the effectiveness of}} proposed and actual securities, financial, and tax laws designed to prevent, or dampen the severity of asset price bubbles, including laws designed to mitigate excessive speculation. The article employs experimental asset market research to measure {{the effectiveness of these}} anti-bubble laws in correcting mispricings. Experimental asset markets represent <b>complex</b> simulations <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> markets in which subjects trade securities over a computer network. These markets allow scholars to test causal links between legal policies and market effects in ways that empirical research alone cannot. With these virtual markets, researchers can identify asset price bubbles - when prices of assets diverge from fundamental values - with a certainty that is beyond the capacity of empirical studies. The article places anti-bubble laws in the following template, which maps onto microeconomic (including behavioral finance) and macroeconomic research on bubble formation: (1) laws that aim to provide information to investors on fundamental value of assets: these laws require enhanced disclosure or investor education either to focus investor attention on information on fundamental value rather than noise or to remedy information asymmetries that lead to asset mispricing; (2) laws that attempt to short circuit positive feedback loops: these anti-bubble laws attempt to dampen the positive feedback created when investors chase rising asset prices and include transaction taxes, circuit breakers and laws that attempt to restrict access of investors to certain markets or channel less sophisticated investors to less risky assets; (3) removal of legal restrictions on arbitrage; and (4) laws that restrict credit to investors to curb speculation (e. g., margin regulations). Experimental (and empirical) evidence suggests the effectiveness of many laws in eliminating bubbles is weak.

Our analysis exploits ultra-high frequency order book data from NASDAQ Nordic {{over a period}} of three years to numerically estimate the power-law scaling exponents using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). We address inter-event durations (order to order, trade to trade, cancel to cancel) as well as cross-event durations (time from order submission to its trade or cancel). We find strong evidence of long-range correlation, which is consistent across different stocks and variables. However, given the crossovers in the DFA fluctuation functions, our results indicate that the long-range correlation in inter-event durations becomes stronger over a longer time scale, i. e., when moving from a range of hours to days and further to months. We also observe interesting associations between the scaling exponent and a number of economic variables, in particular, in the inter-trade time series.
