40|$|A {{conceptual}} {{problem that}} appears in different contexts of clustering analysis is that of measuring the degree of compatibility between two sequences of numbers. This problem is usually addressed by means of numerical indexes referred to as sequence <b>correlation</b> <b>indexes.</b> This paper elaborates on why some specific sequence <b>correlation</b> <b>indexes</b> may not be good choices depending on the application scenario in hand. A variant of the Product-Moment correlation coefficient and a weighted formulation for the Goodman-Kruskal and Kendall`s indexes are derived {{that may be more}} appropriate for some particular application scenarios. The proposed and existing indexes are analyzed from different perspectives, such as their sensitivity to the ranks and magnitudes of the sequences under evaluation, among other relevant aspects of the problem. The results help suggesting scenarios within the context of clustering analysis that are possibly more appropriate for the application of each index. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

Two additional temporal approaches, the <b>correlation</b> <b>index</b> (Joris et al., Hearing Res 216 – 217 : 19 – 30, 2006) and the spike-distance metric (Victor and Purpura, J Neurophysiol 76 : 1310 – 1326, 1996; Netw Comput Neural Syst 8 : 127 – 164, 1997), are tested in the present study. Trends in the <b>correlation</b> <b>index</b> {{as a function of}} stimulus level {{are similar to those of}} the synchronization coefficient (also called the vector strength) when the tone is presented alone. However, the present study found that trends in the <b>correlation</b> <b>index</b> did not agree with those of the synchronization coefficient for tones presented with relatively high-level background noise. Instead, trends in the <b>correlation</b> <b>index</b> generally agreed with those of the temporal reliability metric discussed in Gai and Carney (J Neurophysiol 96 : 2451 – 2464, 2006); that is, the <b>correlation</b> <b>index</b> decreased with increased tone level in the presence of relatively high-level background noise. The spike-distance metric, which was based on absolute spike times or on interspike intervals, was compared to the temporal measures described above, which were generally based on relative spike times. The results confirm that the spike-distance metric is not an optimal temporal metric. In addition, absolute spike times of primary-like responses generally contained much less temporal information than absolute spike times of chopper response types. The present study highlights the importance of relative spike-timing information as characterized by traditional and novel temporal measures...|$|E

Gini's theory, at the same time, has performed a critical deepening which permitted to obtain a complete framework together with a reinterpretation of already known indexes such as Bravais-Pearson's correlation coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to propose a <b>correlation</b> <b>index</b> between average time diagram of Photovoltaic Power Plant {{production}} and a typical diagram of the price of electrical energy at the open market. The basic idea is to define <b>correlation</b> <b>index,</b> which is of key importance for assessing the economy of a Photovoltaic Power Plant under open market conditions. This index may be useful for investors during evaluation of economic parameters of a Photovoltaic Power Plant project which will one part of its lifetime operate at the open market.

The estimated value of <b>correlation</b> <b>index</b> shows that each of the produced MWh at prospective Photovoltaic Power Plant Bavanište will realize a price at The Germain Electricity Market - EEX, which is on average 20. 8 % higher than the average annual price of an MWh.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to evaluate relationships of the rate of migration and the unemployment rate in established member countries of the European Union covering also {{the period of the}} last financial and economic crisis and using statistical methods. To determine parameters of a regression function were used methods of regression and correlation analysis including testing the statistical significance. Nearly all countries (except Luxemburg and Austria) show a negative linear relationship between tested indicators however not always statistically significant. Based on these results, the existence of correlation is evident between the crude rate of net migration and the unemployment rate in more than a half of the monitored countries. Calculated <b>correlation</b> <b>indices</b> show highly statistically significant results for typically immigrant’s destination countries, e. g. Germany, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, and Belgium but we can find statistically significant results also in countries which are facing enormous economic problems during the last financial and economic crisis, esp. in Ireland, Spain and Italy. With an exemption of Belgium, the selected type of regression function doesn’t play a role as it regards the statistical significance of <b>correlation</b> <b>indices</b> and the use of polynomials of higher degrees doesn’t improve those results significantly.

40|$|We {{investigate}} several quantifiers of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal {{with respect}} to their ability to indicate depth of anesthesia. For 17 patients anesthetized with Sevoflurane, three established measures (two spectral and one based on the bispectrum), as well as a phase space based nonlinear <b>correlation</b> <b>index</b> were computed from consecutive EEG epochs. In absence of an independent way to determine anesthesia depth, the standard was derived from measured blood plasma concentrations of the anesthetic via a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model for the estimated effective brain concentration of Sevoflurane. In most patients, the highest correlation is observed for the nonlinear <b>correlation</b> <b>index</b> D*. In contrast to spectral measures, D* is found to decrease monotonically with increasing (estimated) depth of anesthesia, even when a "burst-suppression" pattern occurs in the EEG. The findings show the potential for applications of concepts derived from the theory of nonlinear dynamics, even if little can be assumed about the process under investigation.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Estimation {{of dynamic}} {{cerebral}} autoregulation from spontaneous fluctuations of arterial blood pressure (ABP) and {{cerebral blood flow}} velocity (CBFV) is an attractive monitoring option for cerebral hemodynamic impairment. We evaluated the <b>correlation</b> coefficient <b>index</b> method in patients with severe obstructive carotid disease and compared it with transfer function analysis (frequency domain approach to cerebral autoregulation) and CO 2 vasomotor reactivity. Methods—In 139 patients with severe unilateral carotid stenosis (� 70 %) or occlusion, CBFV (transcranial Doppler) and ABP (Finapres method) were recorded over 10 minutes. Correlations between systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and mean ABP and CBFV oscillations over 1 -minute epochs were averaged over 10 minutes to form the <b>correlation</b> coefficient <b>indexes</b> (Sx, Dx, Mx, respectively). Transfer function parameters (phase shift and gain between ABP and CBFV oscillations) were determined from the entire 10 -minute period. CO 2 reactivity was assessed by inhalation of 7 % CO 2. Results—The <b>correlation</b> <b>indexes</b> Dx and Mx were significantly higher ipsilateral to stenosis and increased with degree of stenosis, indicating increasing dependence of CBFV on ABP and thus impairment of cerebral autoregulation. Dx and Mx correlated moderately but highly significantly with transfer function parameters and CO 2 reactivity and showed a good level of agreement in detecting pathological values. Patients with a small variance of the 1 -minute source correlations of Dx and Mx showed clearly better correlation values. Transfer function parameters and CO 2 reactivity bu...|$|R
