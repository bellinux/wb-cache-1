5|$|At {{the start}} of the 193637 season, Miller was {{selected}} for the Colts, a state under-21 team that played at district level. At the end of the 1936 school year, Miller completed year 10 by passing five of his eight subjects. Disinclined towards university studies, he left school without finishing his leaving year and began working as a clerk for a car business. Miller felt <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could make a career out of sport and therefore felt that further education was unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{home from}} Belgrade on 6 February, the {{aeroplane}} carrying Edwards {{and his team}} mates crashed on takeoff after a refuelling stop in Munich, Germany. Seven players and 14 other passengers died at the scene, and Edwards {{was taken to the}} Rechts der Isar Hospital with multiple leg fractures, fractured ribs and severely damaged kidneys. The doctors treating him were <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> stood some chance of recovery, but were doubtful that he would ever be able to play football again.|$|E
5|$|By January 1967, Suharto felt <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had removed}} all {{significant}} support for Sukarno within the armed forces, and the MPRS {{decided to hold}} another session to impeach Sukarno. On 22 February 1967, Sukarno announced he would resign from the presidency, and on 12 March, the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power and named Suharto acting president. Sukarno was placed under house arrest in Bogor Palace; little more was heard from him, and he died in June 1970. On 27 March 1968, the MPRS appointed Suharto {{for the first of}} his five-year terms as President.|$|E
5000|$|A {{returning}} 1000-yard rusher, Zwinak {{ended up}} {{being part of a}} three-man platoon at running back along with Bill Belton and Akeel Lynch, though he got the majority of the goal line carries - by the fourth game of the season, he had rushed for 8 touchdowns - two more than the 2012 season - and 297 yards. His left guard, Miles Dieffenbach, commented, [...] "Yeah, (Zwinak is) a load to handle so we're pretty <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> going to push it in there." ...|$|R
60|$|Patient had he {{been for}} {{eighteen}} years, <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> ere <b>he</b> died, a just and merciful God would give him this for which he lived and waited.

5|$|De Ferran was <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{could be}} {{competitive}} and achieve a good result {{without having to}} worry about the championship. Da Matta felt his team had learnt more from the series previous race on a superspeedway which he believed would help him in California where he wanted to win. Having moved from 16th to eighth in the points standings with a victory in Laguna Seca and a second-place finish in Germany, Papis stated that he was focused on the race and hoped he would clinch his first victory in a 500-mile event despite having not managed to finish a race on a superspeedway in 2001. Bruno Junqueira was excited to race in Fontana and hoped that he could clinch his second victory of the year.|$|E
5|$|His {{work on the}} X-Men {{franchise}} {{would continue}} {{with a number of}} covers for The New Mutants and The Uncanny X-Men in 1986 and 1987, respectively. He also drew all but three of the first 23 covers and interior frontispieces to Classic X-Men from 1986 to 1988. His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990. It was in drawing the 1988 annual that Adams says he felt like a professional comic book artist for the first time, as he first felt <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knew what he was doing.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Day {{returned}} to moulding Sabrina to meet his requirements for the ideal woman, choosing what she would wear, and pushing his ideas of frugality upon her. Sabrina took on all the ideas willingly and Day believed he had finally created a woman who would meet all his requirements. He was so <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> talked openly of marrying Sabrina, though she was unaware of his intentions. Eventually one of Day's friends {{let her know that}} he hoped to marry her. Sabrina confronted Day about the rumours and he admitted they were true, neglecting to mention that he had hoped to marry her since the day he met her.|$|E

5|$|Physically, Britten {{was never}} robust. He walked and swam {{regularly}} and kept himself as fit as he could, but Carpenter in his 1992 biography mentions 20 illnesses, {{a few of}} them minor but most fairly serious, suffered over the years by Britten before his final heart complaint developed. Emotionally, according to some commentators, Britten never completely grew up, retaining in his outlook something of a child's view of the world. He was not always <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the genius others declared him to be, and though he was hypercritical of his own works, he was acutely, even aggressively sensitive to criticism from anybody else.|$|E
5|$|The office formulates two {{plans to}} save their jobs. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is tasked with {{tracking}} down Robert at a squash court and intercepting the emails before California {{has a chance to}} view them, while Andy, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) head to Schrute Farms, ostensibly to try and change Dwight's mind. However, Pam consistently silences any attempt to bring up the device, saying she knows Dwight and is <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will stop the device on his own. After complimenting Dwight numerous times and having a small meal, Pam makes a joke that emphasizes that everyone is human and makes mistakes.|$|E
5|$|Bryant and Milam {{were indicted}} for murder. The grand jury's prosecuting attorney, Hamilton Caldwell, was not <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{could get a}} {{conviction}} {{in a case of}} white violence against a black male accused of insulting a white woman. A local black paper was surprised at the indictment and praised the decision, as did the New York Times. The high-profile comments published in Northern newspapers and by the NAACP were of concern to the prosecuting attorney, Gerald Chatham; he worried that his office {{would not be able to}} secure a guilty verdict, despite the compelling evidence. Having limited funds, Bryant and Milam initially had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them, but five attorneys at a Sumner law firm offered their services pro bono. Their supporters placed collection jars in stores and other public places in the Delta, eventually gathering $10,000 for the defense.|$|E

5|$|<b>Confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was being}} {{targeted}} by clubs from higher divisions, Bruce resolved not {{to sign a}} new contract with Gillingham when his existing deal expired {{at the end of}} the 1983–84 season. In an April 1983 match against Newport County, he attempted, in a moment of anger, to deliberately injure opposition player Tommy Tynan, but connected awkwardly and succeeded only in breaking his own leg, leaving him unable to play again for six months. He returned in time to play a key role in Gillingham achieving two draws against Everton in the FA Cup in 1984, attracting the attention once again of scouts from First Division clubs. Arthur Cox, manager of Bruce's beloved Newcastle United, expressed an interest in signing the player, but resigned from his job before any further action could be taken. Bruce eventually opted to sign for Norwich City in August 1984 for a fee variously reported as £125,000 or £135,000. In 2009, he was voted into Gillingham's Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{divided the}} empire into four regions, each {{ruled by a}} {{separate}} emperor, the Tetrarchy. <b>Confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> fixed the disorders that were plaguing Rome, he abdicated along with his co-emperor, and the Tetrarchy soon collapsed. Order was eventually restored by Constantine the Great, who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity, and who established Constantinople as the new capital of the eastern empire. During the decades of the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties, the empire was divided along an east–west axis, with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome. The reign of Julian, who attempted to restore Classical Roman and Hellenistic religion, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. Theodosius I, the last emperor to rule over both East and West, died in 395 AD after making Christianity the official religion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|Playford {{went into}} the 1965 {{election}} <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would build upon his previous result. Labor was continuing its practice of concentrating on individual seats: this time the effort was invested in the electorates of Barossa and Glenelg. In Barossa, northern Adelaide urban sprawl was overflowing into an otherwise rural and conservative electorate; in Glenelg, a younger generation of professionals and their families were settling. On election day, 6 March, both seats fell to Labor with substantial swings. The LCL lost power {{for the first time}} in 35 years. In seats that were contested by both parties, Labor led on the primary vote with 52.7 to 43.3%. Playford stayed up on the night to see the result, and conceded defeat at midnight. He appeared calm when announcing the loss to the public, but wept when he told his family of it. Playford had been premier for 26 years and 126 days.|$|E
25|$|Self-efficacy is seen {{to mediate}} {{important}} aspects of how an employee undertakes a given task, such {{as the level of}} effort and persistence. An employee with high self-efficacy is <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> effort <b>he</b> or she puts forth has a high likelihood of resulting in success. In anticipation of success, an employee is willing to put forth more effort, persist longer, remain focused on the task, seek feedback and choose more effective task strategies.|$|R
60|$|Without hesitation, Casanova replied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was assured}} of success--although {{he was far}} from having any grounds for any such assurance. He enjoined the monk to believe him, and to persevere, <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> as <b>he</b> {{advanced}} he would find progress easier. This proved, indeed, to be the case, for soon Balbi found the brickwork yielding so rapidly to his efforts that one morning, a week later, Casanova heard three light taps above his head--the preconcerted signal by which they were to assure themselves that their notions of the topography of the prison were correct.|$|R

5|$|The studio had wasted $5 {{million and}} a year's worth of time with Abel and Associates, {{although}} Abel reportedly gained a new production studio filled with equipment using Paramount's money. Trumbull, meanwhile, had completed Close Encounters but his plan for a full feature had been cancelled by Paramount, a move some considered punishment for passing on Star Trek. With Trumbull now available, primary responsibility for The Motion Pictures optical effects passed on to him. In March the studio offered Trumbull virtual carte blanche {{if he could get}} the opticals work completed by December, the release date to which Paramount was financially committed (having accepted advances from exhibitors planning on a Christmas delivery). Trumbull was <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could get the work done without a loss of quality despite a reputation for missing deadlines because of his perfectionism. Paramount assigned a studio executive to Trumbull to make sure he would meet the release date, and together with Yuricich the effects team rushed to finish. The effects budget climbed to $10million.|$|E
5|$|As {{she grew}} older Betsy {{suffered}} from numerous illnesses, the exact natures {{of which are}} not recorded but which {{are known to have}} caused William great concern. William began to become paranoid that Betsy would marry and leave his service, in 1835 going as far as to have her sign an affidavit that she would never leave him. In 1843 his older brother Charles, a successful planter in Java, returned to England after over 30 years abroad. William became deeply suspicious that Betsy was becoming too close to Charles, a suspicion intensified when Charles took her on a visit to Holland and the Rhine; Charles returned to Java in 1845. In around 1844 Betsy struck up a close relationship with the pen manufacturer and art collector Joseph Gillott, one of William's regular customers who owned some of his pictures. Gillott was married with children, and the closeness of their relationship caused William concern. In 1848, William retired to York leaving Betsy alone in his London apartment; although aware that Betsy was considering marriage he was <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could persuade her to come to York and live with him in his retirement. Betsy did eventually join him in York, and was present at his death.|$|E
5|$|From 1937 Burnet was {{involved}} in a variety of scientific and public policy bodies, starting with a position on a government advisory council on polio. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame shyness to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation with the media if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of public attitudes and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics. However, despite making many appearances on radio and television, he never became at ease with interviews and had to be selective with outreach engagements due to the many invitations he received, and tended to accept those that had the potential to promote the Institute. Over time, he began to increase his activism, as he felt more <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be able to make an impact as his reputation grew, especially after winning the Nobel Prize, and even more so after his retirement from the directorship of the Institute. Although Burnet was not naturally outgoing, he saw it as the social responsibility of a scientific leader and scholar to publicly speak out and impart wisdom and foresight to the wider community.|$|E

60|$|The {{advice was}} good, but unnecessary, Mr. Hardy having already fixed on that evening as a {{suitable}} opportunity to disclose {{to the captain}} {{the nature of the}} efforts he had been making on his behalf.

500|$|Valverde's {{performance}} {{was described as}} [...] "a master class on how to race the Mur de Huy" [...] by VeloNews, which went on to describe him as [...] "king of the Mur". Valverde himself said that taking {{the record for the}} most wins in the race was [...] "a real honour". He gave credit to his team – and especially to Giovanni Visconti – for driving hard just before the climb started, in order to get him into the perfect position. <b>He</b> said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been <b>confident</b> <b>that,</b> if <b>he</b> accelerated in the final part of the climb, {{he would be able to}} stay away to the finish line.|$|R
5|$|In the 1918 midterm congressional elections, held {{just before}} the armistice, Republicans {{narrowly}} {{took control of the}} Senate. Harding was appointed to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Wilson took no senators with him to the Paris Peace Conference, <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could force what became the Treaty of Versailles through the Senate by appealing to the people. When he returned with a single treaty establishing both peace and a League of Nations, the country was overwhelmingly on his side. Many senators disliked Article X of the League Covenant, that committed signatories to the defense of any member nation that was attacked, seeing it as forcing the United States to war without the assent of Congress. Harding was one of 39 senators who signed a round-robin letter opposing the League. When Wilson invited the Foreign Relations Committee to the White House to informally discuss the treaty, Harding ably questioned Wilson about Article X; the president evaded his inquiries. The Senate debated Versailles in September 1919, and Harding made a major speech against it. By then, Wilson had suffered a stroke while on a speaking tour. With an incapacitated President in the White House and less support in the country, the treaty was defeated.|$|E
5|$|The {{final mass}} test session {{before the new}} season {{took place at the}} track over 1–3 April. On the first day, in hot weather conditions, Mitch Evans set the fastest lap of the morning session with a time of 1:42.479, with Jordan King setting the quickest lap of the day in the {{afternoon}} session with a 1:41.494. An overnight sandstorm caused the second day's running to be delayed for one hour while circuit officials cleaned the track. Sergey Sirotkin was the fastest driver in the morning session with a lap of 1:41.797, and Nobuharu Matsushita recorded the quickest lap of the afternoon session with a time of 1:40.191. Pierre Gasly recorded the fastest lap time of the three days, a 1:39.632 in the morning session, and Nigel Melker was the quickest driver in the afternoon session with a lap of 1:41.566. Hilmer Motorsport elected to miss the round as they were unable to acquire the services of a driver who could bring financial backing to the team. Team principal Franz Hilmer was <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would enter {{the second round of the}} season in Catalunya.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Montoya clinched his second consecutive pole position and his third of the season with a time of 1:22.216. Although he was happy with the feel of his car, he did not feel <b>confident</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could take pole position. Montoya was joined on the front row by Barrichello who recorded a lap 0.312 seconds slower and also went off into a gravel trap during qualifying. Michael Schumacher qualified third and admitted to making a mistake on his third run which prevented him from setting a quicker time. Ralf Schumacher had balance issues which meant his car alternated between understeer and oversteer en route to fourth position. He also managed three clear runs before his fourth was disrupted by a yellow flag. Trulli qualified fifth and was delighted with his car and tyres. Coulthard qualified in sixth position and felt his car's balance was good although felt it difficult to push hard and achieve ideal grip. Häkkinen took seventh and ran wide at the exit of Curva di Lesmo on his final timed run and crashed heavily into a barrier which resulted in a large amount of damage to the front and left side of his car. Häkkinen was unhurt but the crash caused qualifying to be suspended for thirteen minutes.|$|E
