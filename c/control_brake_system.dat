Straight-line braking tests were carried out from 40 [*]km/h in order to compare a commercially electro-pneumatic available anti-lock <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> and the Cambridge Vehicle Dynamics Consortium system, which has bi-stable valves coupled with a sliding-mode slip controller. On average, the Cambridge Vehicle Dynamics Consortium system reduced the stopping distance and the air use by 15 % and 22 % respectively compared with those for the conventional anti-lock <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> The most significant improvements were seen on a wet basalt-tile surface (with similar friction properties to ice) where the stopping distance and the air use were improved by 17 % and 30 % respectively. A third performance metric, namely the mean absolute slip error, is introduced to quantify the ability of each <b>braking</b> <b>system</b> to track a wheel slip demand. Using this metric, the bi-stable valve system is shown to improve the wheel slip demand tracking by 62 % {{compared with that of}} the conventional anti-lock <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> This improvement potentially allows more accurate control of the wheel forces during extreme manoeuvres, providing scope for the future development of advanced stability control systems...|$|R
