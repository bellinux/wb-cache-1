5|$|The first {{ships were}} {{designed}} {{around the time}} of the Vietnam War, and certain aspects of the design were influenced by operations there.

As a result of this experience, Nimitz carriers were designed with larger stores of aviation fuel and larger magazines in relation to previous carriers, although this was partly as a result of increased space available by the new design of the ships' propulsion systems.|$|E

5|$|The idea of Żydokomuna {{continued}} to endure to a <b>certain</b> <b>extent</b> in postwar Poland (1944–1956), because Polish anti-communists saw the Soviet-controlled Communist regime as the fruition of prewar anti-Polish agitation; with it came {{the implication of}} Jewish responsibility. The Soviet appointments of Jews to positions responsible for oppressing the populace further fueled this perception. Some 37.1% of post-war management of UB employees {{and members of the}} communist authorities in Poland were of Jewish origin. They were described in intelligence reports as very loyal to the Soviets (Szwagrzyk). Some Polish historians have impugned the loyalty of Jews returning to Poland from the USSR after the Soviet takeover, which has raised the specter of Żydokomuna in the minds of other scholars.|$|E

He may also have encouraged an alliance between the Church and Date Masamune to take over the country (an idea advertised by the Franciscans while in Rome), which, in 1620 Japan, would have been a totally unrealistic proposition. Lastly, hopes of trade with Spain evaporated when Hasekura communicated that the Spanish King would not enter an agreement as long as persecutions were occurring {{in the rest of the}} country.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} makes choices {{throughout}} the game, the gameplay's plot is revealed. Besides affecting dialogue and story developments, {{the outcome of}} entire scenes (and in some cases, the outcome of scenes several chapters later) can be manipulated to a <b>certain</b> <b>extent</b> based on player choices. These choices are typically moral decisions made through Jodie's dialogue options, interventions with various characters, success or failure in her combat scenes, or psychic actions that the player chooses to have Aiden perform. Examples of choice-based outcomes are the chapter titled The Party, where the player is given the choice of unleashing brutal revenge toward a group of bullies or simply running away, and the chapter titled The Embassy, where the player can either engage in psychic information retrieval or can jeopardize the mission by forcing {{one of the guards}} to commit suicide. Choices also determine the finale of Beyond: Two Souls, as any number of possible plot endings can be experienced by the player.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} things Tacitus {{mentions}} in his work Germania is that the Germanic people treasure their animals above all else. Tacitus also concludes that the Germanic people found cultivation repulsive. Instead, he states, the Germanic people devote themselves to food and sleep and besides that they prefer to remain idle. All of this, to <b>certain</b> <b>extents,</b> applied to Jämtland. When the people of Jämtland settled down they relied mostly on pastoralism (transhumance). Their animals were the source of wealth and they were therefore loved by their owners. This love for the livestock has manifested itself in the dialect, a male nipple is called bokkjen (the buck) and a female nipple is known as geita (the goat).|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{effective}} SINR mapping (ESM) {{methods for}} link abstraction (or channel quality evaluation) used in system level performance simulation. Among all existing ESM methods, the mean mutual information per-bit (MMIB) ESM {{has been shown}} to be superior in terms of high accurate block error rate (BLER) prediction and supporting multiple modulation schemes within one data block. However, complicated multi-Gaussian distribution approximation is needed in MMIB-ESM when high modulation schemes such as 16 QAM and 64 QAM are considered. This paper proposes a new generalized bit-wise E-ESM (BE-ESM), which is shown to have similar performance as MMIB-ESM but with a very simple structure. Furthermore, it is also shown that BE-ESM and MMIB-ESM can be equivalent to each other in <b>certain</b> <b>extents.</b> © 2009 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a <b>certain</b> <b>extent,</b> have {{control over their own}} health and well-being. They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact. In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E
5|$|In the 8th century AD {{the city}} had {{important}} relationships with Maya cities to the southwest, especially in the Petexbatún region, and on the Pasión and Usumacinta rivers, including Seibal (on the Pasión), Altar de Sacrificios (near where the Pasión becomes the Usumacinta), and Dos Pilas, Aguateca, Tamarindito, Arroyo de Piedra and Cueva de Sangre (all five in the Petexbatún region). It {{is possible that the}} widespread distribution of Ik-style ceramics in elite tombs at sites in the Petexbatún region may be linked to the military defeat of Motul de San José by Dos Pilas, with these high quality ceramics forming a part of the tribute payment made to the Petexbatún kingdom. After its defeat {{at the hands of the}} Petexbatún kingdom, Motul de San José no longer erected sculpted stelae but the history of the site continued to be recorded to a <b>certain</b> <b>extent</b> in texts on Ik-style ceramics.|$|E
5|$|James Douglas, 2nd Marquess of Douglas, the 12th Earl of Angus, was forced, due to {{gambling}} debts accrued {{by himself}} and his father, to consolidate his estates.

Dalrymple allowed the castle to decay further, and to be quarried to a <b>certain</b> <b>extent</b> for stone. Sir Walter Scott described the castle at length in his 1808 epic poem Marmion.
