40|$|Two of Africa's most {{crippling}} livestock diseases {{will soon}} be controllable by a single vaccination. Rinderpest and <b>capripox</b> (lumpy skin disease of cattle, sheep pox and goat pox) cause serious loss of productivity {{and can lead to}} mortality rates that can exceed 90 %. Vaccines have been available to control rinderpest and they are effective, but because of their poor thermal stability in the tropics, they have not led to the eradication of the disease. A <b>capripox</b> vaccine is widely used to vaccinate against sheep and goat pox. It is also effective in protecting cattle against lumpy skin disease. Researchers at the Pirbright Laboratory of the Institute of Animal Health, in the UK, have taken the <b>capripox</b> vaccine and added into it two genes from the rinderpest virus, to create what is known as a recombinant vaccine. These two genes produce proteins which play an important part in developing immunity against rinderpest. The genes are known as the Fusion or F gene, and the Haemagglutinin or H gene. Either the F or H gene are spliced into the genetic make-up of the virus that causes lumpy skin disease, making two recombinant vaccines. These recombinant vaccines continue to protect cattle, sheep and goats against lumpy skin disease as well as producing either the F or H proteins which give protection against rinderpest. Thus one injection will provide protection against both diseases. The researchers have also achieved better shelf-life with the new vaccines than the old rinderpest vaccine. This means they will not be dependent on refrigeration, so their distribution in tropical Africa will be easier. A mixture of the recombinant capripox-rinderpest F and the capripax-rinderpest H vaccines is now under trial with the Kenya Agriculture Research Institute at Muguga.

40|$|Objective: We {{aimed at}} {{determining}} the prevalence and characterizing the CaPV, determining the CaPV-PPRV coinfection prevalence and providing data about phylogenetic {{relationship between the}} fusion protein of PPRV and P 32 gene of CaPV. Materials and methods: A total of 150 samples including animals swabs, tissues and blood were collected from unvaccinated goats in a PPR and/or <b>Capripox</b> outbreaks in South Kivu, Eastern of Democratic Republic of the Congo. Conventional PCR and reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) were used respectively to amplify P 32, RPO 30, GPCR genes of <b>Capripox</b> virus and Fusion (F) protein of PPRV. Positive samples were sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Results: Out of 150 tested animals, 64. 7 % (n= 97 / 150) were PPRV positive, 52. 7 % (n= 79 / 150) were <b>Capripox</b> positive and 38. 7 % (n= 58 / 150) were positive for both PPRV and CaPV.

40|$|AbstractA {{recombinant}} <b>capripox</b> {{virus was}} constructed containing a cDNA copy of genome segment 7 of bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 1 from South Africa (BTV 1 SA), which expressed {{high levels of}} the major BTV core protein VP 7 in infected lamb testis (LT) cells. Sheep vaccinated with this recombinant virus developed antibodies to VP 7 (detected by ELISA) but no neutralizing antibodies to either the homologous or heterologous BTV serotype, prior to challenge (BTV 1 or BTV 3, respectively). Following challenge with a virulent heterotypic strain of BTV (BTV 3 SA), all of the animals developed clinical signs of disease, indicating that they were infected and that the challenge virus did replicate. While all of the control animals died, six of the eight animals that were vaccinated with the recombinant <b>capripox</b> virus expressing VP 7 recovered fully.

40|$|Two highly {{contagious}} diseases, Peste des Petits Ruminants and Sheep and Goat Pox, constitute main constraints {{to small}} ruminants production {{in many countries}} in Asia, the Near and Middle East and Africa. Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR), also known {{in the past as}} goat plague, is a highly contagious viral disease affecting domestic and wild small ruminants. It is caused by a virus which belongs to the Morbillivirus genus of Paramyxoviridae family: the Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus (PPRV). It is a rinderpest-like infection of goats and sheep characterized by erosive stomatitis, enteritis, pneumonia and death. Economically, it is the most important small ruminant disease in areas where it is endemic. In the same regions, there is a second contagious viral disease, Sheep and goat pox. The responsible pathogens, the sheeppox virus (SPPV) and goatpox virus (GTPV), cause acute to sub acute disease of infected sheep and goats respectively. The clinical signs of infection may include generalized pox lesions throughout the skin and mucous membranes, persistent fever, lymphadenitis, and often a focal pneumonia and nodules lesions distributed uniformly throughout the lungs. There is no curative medical treatment against these two viral diseases. Therefore, the only way of tackling them is by means of sanitary and medical prophylaxis. Sanitary prophylaxis to be effective needs the existence of efficient veterinary services, the implementation of animal movement controls with sometimes the stamping out policy. The cost needed for the effective implementation of these means in a short period is too high for most of countries where these diseases are endemic. Therefore the only way for effective control of PPR and sheep and goat pox in those countries is the medical prophylaxis, i. e. the vaccination. Currently, efficient attenuated vaccines exist against each of these diseases. Unfortunately, in most cases they are used only in case of outbreaks to limit their extension. The cost of the logistic needed for systematic vaccination campaigns of small ruminants against either PPR or <b>capripox</b> may be too high for countries if only the individual economic value of goat or sheep, excluding their social value, is considered. The way to cut down this cost is the use of polyvalent vaccine which would enable, in one shot, the protection of animals against more than one economic important disease. The objective of our thesis work was to develop a recombinant thermostable (a characteristic linked to capripoxes) vaccine {{that could be used to}} protect sheep and goats against both PPR and <b>capripox</b> and thereby that would contribute to cut down the cost of vaccination campaigns. For that, the complementary DNA, cDNA, corresponding to the gene of PPRV immune protective proteins, the fusion (F) and the haemagglutinin (H) proteins were inserted into the genome of the attenuated strain <b>capripox</b> virus strain KS 1. Such a recombinant vaccine may be thermotolerant, a characteristic of poxviruses and this may improve the quality of the vaccine for its use in hot climate conditions. <b>Capripox</b> viruses are highly host-specific microorganisms. They are not pathogenic to human and their host range is limited to cattle and small ruminants and possibly buffaloes. Therefore they constitute an ideal and safe vector for the development of recombinant vaccines for use against ruminant diseases. The present manuscript in which we report on the results we have obtained during our thesis work is composed of the following different parts: a general introduction, a literature review of PPR and <b>capripox</b> viruses, the construction of two recombinant vaccines FPPR/Capripox and HPPR/Capripox, the comparison of efficacy of three poxvirus promoters in HPPR...|$|E
40|$|Sheep pox {{and goat}} pox (SGP) of small {{ruminants}} are most severing pox diseases of domestic animals, {{and they have}} a very important role in agricultural economy.

40|$|AbstractLumpy {{skin disease}} is of {{significant}} economic impact for the cattle industry in Africa. The disease is currently spreading aggressively in the Near East, posing {{a threat of}} incursion to Europe and Asia. Due to cross-protection within the Capripoxvirus genus, sheep pox virus (SPPV) vaccines {{have been widely used}} for cattle against lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV). In the Middle East and the Horn of Africa these vaccines have been associated with incomplete protection and adverse reactions in cattle post-vaccination. The present study confirms that the real identity of the commonly used Kenyan sheep and goat pox vaccine virus (KSGP) O- 240 is not SPPV but is actually LSDV. The low level attenuation of this virus is likely to be not sufficient for safe use in cattle, causing clinical disease in vaccinated animals. In addition, Isiolo and Kedong goat pox strains, capable of infecting sheep, goats and cattle are identified for potential use as broad-spectrum vaccine candidates against all <b>capripox</b> diseases...|$|E

40|$|Sheep {{and goat}} pox are {{contagious}} viral diseases of small ruminants. These diseases may be mild in indigenous breeds living in endemic areas, but are often fatal in newly introduced animals. Economic losses result from decreased milk production, {{damage to the}} quality of hides and wool, and other production losses. Sheep and goat pox can limit trade and prevent the development of intensive livestock production. They may also prevent new breeds of sheep or goats from being imported into endemic regions. The agents of sheep and goat pox could be used in agroterrorism, and are listed in the USDA National Select Agent Registry. Etiology Sheep pox and goat pox result from infection by sheeppox virus (SPV) or goatpox virus (GPV), closely related members of the <b>Capripox</b> genus in the family Poxviridae.

40|$|Sheep pox virus (SPPV), goat pox virus (GTPV) and lumpy {{skin disease}} virus (LSDV) are very closely related viruses of the Capripoxvirus (CaPV) genus of the Poxviridae family. They are {{responsible}} for sheep pox, goat pox and {{lumpy skin disease}} which affect sheep, goat and cattle, respectively. The epidemiology of <b>capripox</b> diseases is complex, as some CaPVs are not strictly host-specific. Additionally, the three forms of the disease co-exist in many sub-Saharan countries which complicates the identification of the virus responsible for an outbreak. Genotyping of CaPVs using a low-cost, rapid, highly specific, and easy to perform method allows a swift and accurate identification of the causative agent and significantly assists in selecting appropriate control and eradication measures, such as the most suitable vaccine against the virus during the outbreaks. The objective {{of this paper is to}} describe the design and analytical performances of a new molecular assay for CaPV genotyping using unlabelled snapback primers in the presence of dsDNA intercalating EvaGreen dye.

40|$|Sheeppox, goatpox and peste des petits {{ruminants}} (PPR) {{are highly}} contagious ruminant diseases widely distributed in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Capripoxvirus (CPV) -vectored recombinant PPR vaccines (rCPV-PPR vaccines), {{which have been}} developed and shown to protect against both <b>Capripox</b> (CP) and PPR, would be critical tools in the control of these important diseases. In {{most parts of the}} world, these disease distributions overlap each other leaving concerns about the potential impact that pre-existing immunity against either disease may have on the protective efficacy of these bivalent rCPV-PPR vaccines. Currently, this question has not been indisputably addressed. Therefore, we undertook this study, under experimental conditions designed for the context of mass vaccination campaigns of small ruminants, using the two CPV recombinants (Kenya sheep- 1 (KS- 1) strain-based constructs) developed previously in our laboratory. Pre-existing immunity was first induced by immunization either with an attenuated CPV vaccine strain (KS- 1) or the attenuated PPRV vaccine strain (Nigeria 75 / 1) and animals were thereafter inoculated once subcutaneously with a mixture of CPV recombinants expressing either the hemagglutinin (H) or the fusion (F) protein gene of PPRV (103 TCID 50 /animal of each). Finally, these animals were challenged with a virulent CPV strain followed by a virulent PPRV strain 3 weeks later. Our study demonstrated full protection against CP for vaccinated animals with prior exposure to PPRV and a partial protection against PPR for vaccinated animals with prior exposure to CPV. The latter animals exhibited a mild clinical form of PPR and did not show any post-challenge anamnestic neutralizing antibody response against PPRV. The implications of these results are discussed herein and suggestions made for future research regarding the development of CPV-vectored vaccines. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{optimize}} the different available molecular based techniques, validate the Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for detection of Capripoxviruses (CaPVs) DNA and deep sequencing {{to confirm the}} results of the LAMP assay and ensure that an effective and reliable detection method is recommended and adopted for use in <b>Capripox</b> diagnosis. The phylogenetic analysis was also to determine CaPVs genome variability, evolution, and diversity. Study Design: It included sample collection, DNA extraction, analysis and sequencing. Place and Duration of Study: Biosciences East and Central Africa-International Livestock Research Institute (BecA-ILRI) Hub, between May 2014 and March 2015. Methodology: We analyzed 130 samples including blood, skin nodules and cell cultures from symptomatic and suspected sheep, goats and cattle. The samples were tested by, conventional PCR, LAMP assay and real time PCR as the gold standard method, the results obtained were compared and used to determine sensitivity and specificity. The Limit of detection (LOD) of real time PCR and LAMP assay was determined using a serially diluted positive sample. Deep sequencing of 18 LAMP positive samples from {{different parts of the country}} was done and the obtained sequenced data analyzed using bioinformatics platform. Results: The disease prevalence in the population was 61 %, The validated LAMP assay had a 97 % sensitivity and a specificity of 100 %. Using the Fisher's Exact Tests, a P-value of (P =. 8) at 95 % interval was obtained. This shows that there is no significant difference between the validated LAMP Assay and the gold standard method. The Phylogenetic analysis of the 3 important CaPVs genes revealed the distribution of CaPVs into the 3 major specific lineages. Conclusion: This study supports the adoption of LAMP assays for CaPVs diagnosis as a rapid and robust method of detection, disease monitoring and controlling outbreaks. The sequence data confirms the possibility of cross infection, nonhost specificity of CaPVs and also provides a reference in genomic research and a basis for molecular epidemiological studies in Kenya.

40|$|Lumpy {{skin disease}} (LSD), {{affecting}} cattle in Africa, Madagascar and the Middle East, {{is caused by}} a <b>capripox</b> virus that belongs to the family Poxviridae. The disease is of economical importance in endemic areas and the Office International des Epizooties classifies it as a “List A”- disease. Effective control of LSD requires accurate and rapid laboratory techniques to confirm a tentative clinical diagnosis. Comparative studies on different diagnostic tests used at different stages of the disease have not been done. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the different tests that are available and to provide data to assist in the selection of a rapid and sensitive laboratory test for the diagnosis of LSD. Six seronegative, prepubertal bulls were infected via the intravenous route and kept in an insect-free facility. The course of infection was monitored. During a three months’ period blood and semen samples were collected for virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and skin biopsies for the PCR, virus isolation, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), histopathological examination and immunoperoxidase staining of tissue sections. Antibody titres were assessed using the serum virus neutralization test (SNT) and indirect immunofluorescence test (IFAT). The incubation period in infected animals varied from 4 to 5 days. The length of viraemia did not correlate with the severity of clinical disease. By using virus isolation the duration of viraemia was determined to be from 1 to 12 days and by PCR from 4 to 11 days, which is longer than has previously been stated. Virus was isolated from semen until day 43 post-infection (p. i.) whereas the PCR could detect LSD virus nucleic acid until day 161 p. i. Virus was isolated from skin biopsies until day 39 p. i. and PCR could demonstrate viral DNA in them until day 92 p. i. The PCR was a fast and sensitive method to demonstrate viral DNA in blood, skin and semen samples. It could detect viral nucleic acid for significantly longer periods than any of the conventional methods. Virus isolation from blood, skin and semen samples was sensitive and reliable, but as a single test it may be too time-consuming although this depends how rapidly the diagnosis must be confirmed. The IFAT can be used for rapid confirmation of a clinical diagnosis but it needs careful standardization due to non-specific staining. The SNT showed positive results later in the course of the clinical disease than IFAT but it was however, sensitive and reliable in detecting antibodies from all the animals in this experiment. Transmission electron microscopy of skin biopsies detected LSD virus only in one of the four bulls that developed skin lesions. This indicated that even though TEM is usually considered to be a fast and reliable method, a negative result must still be confirmed using another method. Histopathological changes of the skin lesions in sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin were typical for the disease. It was not possible to make a reliable diagnosis of LSD based only on immunoperoxidase staining of tissue sections. In conclusion, this study indicated the PCR to be superior in detecting LSD virus from blood, skin and semen samples. However, virus isolation is still required when the infectivity of the LSD virus is to be investigated. Even though the IFAT has been used for several decades, it is still a valuable tool in detecting antibodies against LSD virus. Both the SNT and IFAT are useful and reliable in retrospective, epidemiological studies. Dissertation (MSc (Veterinary Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

40|$|Lumpy {{skin disease}} (LSD) {{is one of}} {{economically}} important viral diseases of cattle in Ethiopia caused by Lumpy skin disease virus in the member of the genus <b>Capripox</b> viruses. The objective of this thesis is {{to better understand the}} epidemiological features of the disease in order to propose practical and applicable control and prevention options. The thesis is classified in five chapters. The first chapter describes the general agricultural production system in Ethiopia and relates the current knowledge on the virus and the disease as given by the literature. The second chapter deals with the performance of indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) as a serological diagnostic and screening tool that was evaluated using methods without gold standard. Virus neutralization test (VNT) was used as the second test for comparison. The analysis of conditional dependent Bayesian model showed that the IFAT had good accuracy both in sensitivity (92 %) and specificity (88 %) parameters indicating that it could be used for LSD diagnosis and screening (epidemiological studies, epidemiosurveillance) with less misclassification. Its capacity to run large number of samples per plate just like ELISA could be also taken as an advantage for large epidemiological studies. The sensitivity and specificity of VNT was 78 %, 97 % respectively. The two tests IFAT and VNT were found conditionally independent on the disease status of the animal. Thus, higher sensitivity and throughput for IFAT would render the test being selected for screening purposes and higher specificity performance of VNT would qualify it {{to be used as a}} confirmation test. A cross sectional study was then conducted to estimate the prevalence of LSD at herd and animal-levels and to analyze the risk factors associated with the disease occurrence in Ethiopia. It is presented in the third chapter. A total of 330 questionnaire surveys were collected from 44 peasant associations (PA) distributed in 15 districts. The average herd level LSD prevalence was 42. 8 % (95 % CI: 37. 5 – 48. 3) and it was significantly higher in the midland agro-climate 55. 2 % (95 % CI: 47. 5 – 62. 6) than in lowland and highland agro-climate zones (22. 3 % and 43. 5 %, respectively). The observed LSD prevalence and mortality at animal level were 8. 1 % and 2. 12 % respectively which were still higher in the midland zone (10. 4 % and 3. 2 %, respectively) than in lowland and highland zones (P< 0. 05). The risk factor analysis showed that three variables: the effect of agro-climates, communal grazing/watering management and introduction of new animals were significantly associated with LSD occurrence. The temporal association between LSD occurrence and increase in the biting-fly population was also positively correlated by Spearman rank correlation coefficient (0. 88, 0. 79 and 0. 79 for highland, midland and lowland zones, respectively) and statistically significant. The need to evaluate the financial feasibility and benefit possibly expected of vaccination led us to the fourth component of the thesis: The financial cost of clinical LSD at the farm level and the economic benefit of its control by vaccination from the farmers' perspective were analyzed in five selected districts in Oromia Regional state, Ethiopia. A pre-tested questionnaire survey addressing the period of one year production cycle was considered and 747 questionnaires were collected. Descriptive epidemiological results were obtained from the questionnaire survey data. Annual cumulative incidence, mortality and case fatality rates were calculated for each breed, sex and age groups. Annual financial cost due to clinical LSD infection was calculated as the sum of the average production losses due to morbidity and mortality. The variables that accounted for financial cost estimation were milk loss, beef loss, traction power loss, and treatment and vaccination costs. Annual financial costs per head were estimated of 6. 43 USD in local zebu and of 58 USD in Holstein Friesian (HF) / crossbred cattle in infected herds. The financial benefit of controlling LSD through a one year planned vaccination was calculated using partial budget analysis and the changes in the enterprise outputs from the control intervention were measured from the variables milk production, beef production and draft work-output. The marginal rate of return (MRR) gained from the control intervention was estimated at 76 (7600 %) and the net benefit per head was 3 USD and 33 USD in local zebu and HF/crossbreds cattle respectively. This implied that annual vaccination had enabled to reduce the financial costs due to LSD by 40 % and 58 % per head in local zebu and HF/crossbreds respectively. The analysis of the planned vaccination as compared to a non vaccination scenario for a one year time horizon have shown that the livestock producers would get substantial benefit not only from financial gain perspective but also to secure and maintain sustainable enterprise business. Finally in the fifth chapter, general discussion on the epidemiological study and control options were presented along with persistent knowledge gaps that requires further research efforts to finetune the proposed control and prevention options. The result from the risk factor analysis could also shed light on the epidemiology of LSD in other African countries suffering from the disease...|$|E
