5|$|No {{surviving}} Greek texts written {{after the}} year 100 can be securely {{identified as having}} a Jewish author. After this time, Jewish writings in Greek became irrelevant to Christians, who were thus unlikely to preserve them. The manuscription tradition of medieval Jewish <b>culture</b> <b>has</b> preserved only writings in Hebrew and Aramaic.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{attribute of}} Toraja language {{is the notion}} of grief. The importance of death ceremony in Toraja <b>culture</b> <b>has</b> characterised their languages to express intricate degrees of grief and mourning. The Toraja language contains many terms referring to sadness, longing, depression, and mental pain. Giving a clear expression of the psychological and physical effect of loss is a catharsis and sometimes lessens the pain of grief itself.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{study of}} Barbadian music remains limited. Some song {{collections}} {{and other activities}} have been conducted, but there remain significant holes in scholarship, such as the musics of recent immigrants from China and India, who presumably have brought with them styles of Indian and Chinese musics. Due {{to a lack of}} archaeological and historical records, the island's indigenous music is unknown. Since the 1970s, an increase in general interest in Barbadian <b>culture</b> <b>has</b> spurred greater study of music, and given an incentive to radio and television stations to create and maintain archives of cultural practices.|$|E

Historical Chinese <b>culture</b> <b>has</b> not recognized {{a concept of}} sexual orientation, or a framework to divide people based on their same-sex or opposite-sex attractions. Although {{there was a significant}} culture surrounding homosexual men, there was none for women. Outside their duties to bear sons to their husbands, women were perceived as having no sexuality at all.|$|E
5|$|Early {{speech or}} {{behavioral}} interventions can help {{children with autism}} gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.

Japan has a developed {{system for the}} protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures. Nineteen sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, fifteen of which are of cultural significance.|$|E

Clitocine {{has also been shown}} to promote apoptosis (cell death) in human cervical cancer cells in vitro (HeLa).

Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media. However, the revival of Spanish-influence folk music has been possible thanks to the different choir groups coming in and going out of the country, such as the Philippine Madrigal Singers.|$|E

5|$|Canadian <b>culture</b> <b>has</b> {{historically}} {{been influenced by}} Indigenous, French and British cultures and traditions. Most of Canada's territory was inhabited and developed later than other European colonies in the Americas, {{with the result that}} themes and symbols of pioneers, trappers, and traders were important in the early development of the Canadian identity. First Nations played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The British conquest of New France in the mid-1700s brought a large Francophone population under British Imperial rule, creating a need for compromise and accommodation. The new British rulers left alone much of the religious, political, and social culture of the French-speaking habitants, guaranteeing through the Quebec Act of 1774 the right of the Canadiens to practise the Catholic faith and to use French civil law (now Quebec law).|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century, Peking opera {{witnessed}} a steady decline in audience numbers. This has been attributed both to a decrease in performance quality and an inability of the traditional opera form to capture modern life. Furthermore, the archaic language of Peking opera required productions to use electronic subtitles, which hampered the development of the form. The influence of Western <b>culture</b> <b>has</b> also left the younger generations impatient with the slow pacing of Peking opera. In response, Peking opera began to see reform starting in the 1980s. Such reforms have taken the form of creating a school of performance theory to increase performance quality, employing modern elements to attract new audiences, and performing new plays outside of the traditional canon. However, these reforms have been hampered by both a lack of funding and an adverse political climate that makes the performance of new plays difficult.|$|E
5|$|Manitoba's <b>culture</b> <b>has</b> been {{influenced}} by traditional (Aboriginal and Métis) and modern Canadian artistic values, {{as well as by}} the cultures of its immigrant populations and American neighbours. The Minister of Culture, Heritage, Tourism and Sport is responsible for promoting and, to some extent, financing Manitoban culture. Manitoba is the birthplace of the Red River Jig, a combination of aboriginal pow-wows and European reels popular among early settlers. Manitoba's traditional music has strong roots in Métis and Aboriginal culture, in particular the old-time fiddling of the Métis. Manitoba's cultural scene also incorporates classical European traditions. The Winnipeg-based Royal Winnipeg Ballet (RWB), is Canada's oldest ballet and North America's longest continuously operating ballet company; it was granted its royal title in 1953 under Queen Elizabeth II. The Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra (WSO) performs classical music and new compositions at the Centennial Concert Hall. Manitoba Opera, founded in 1969, also performs out of the Centennial Concert Hall.|$|E

Christianity plays an important part to the indigenous cultures in the interior side in the daily lives of the Kadazan-Dusun, Lundayeh, Murut and Rungus beside their old practice of the traditional Animism and Paganism. Interracial marriage among the different ethnicity and religion are common in Sabah.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} sea {{in human}} <b>culture</b> <b>has</b> been {{important}} for centuries, as people experience the sea in contradictory ways: as powerful but serene, beautiful but dangerous. Human responses to the sea {{can be found in}} artforms including literature, art, poetry, film, theatre, and classical music. The earliest art representing boats is 40,000 years old. Since then, artists in different countries and cultures have depicted the sea. Symbolically, the sea has been perceived as a hostile environment populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology. In the works of the psychiatrist Carl Jung, the sea symbolises the personal and the collective unconscious in dream interpretation.|$|E
