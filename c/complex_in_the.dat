A palace was also built during the reign of Darius, with an inscription in the name of Cyrus the Great.

5|$|American {{historian}} Richard Landes, {{who specializes}} {{in the history of}} apocalypticism and was co-founder and director of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger alarmism among millenarians and even the introduction of Gutenberg's printing press in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking. The Year 2000 problem, bar codes and Social Security numbers all triggered end-time warnings which either proved to be false or simply were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes. Civil libertarians argue that the privatization of surveillance {{and the rise of the}} surveillance-industrial <b>complex</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States does raise legitimate concerns about the erosion of privacy. However, skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism caution that such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia about Big Brother or religious hysteria about the Antichrist.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} two tightly bound protein subunits, many {{proteins}} interact with the exosome complex in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. These loosely associated proteins may regulate the activity and specificity of the exosome <b>complex.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> cytoplasm, the exosome interacts with AU rich element (ARE) binding proteins (e.g. KRSP and TTP), which can promote or prevent degradation of mRNAs. The nuclear exosome associates with RNA binding proteins (e.g. MPP6/Mpp6 and C1D/Rrp47 in humans/yeast) that are required for processing certain substrates.|$|E
5|$|As a countermeasure, {{cultures}} of the nematode Deladenus siricidicola {{have been used as}} biological control to protect trees since the 1980s. This parasite feeds on the mycelia of A.areolatum and is therefore a food competitor of wood wasp larvae. Where S.noctilio larvae are present, the parasite infects and sterilizes the eggs of female wasps, causing them to be infertile. These infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus spread the nematode. This control method has proven to be relatively successful to combat the Sirex–Amylostereum <b>complex.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Southern Hemisphere, where the technique has been widely employed, reductions of parasitism levels of 70%–100% have been achieved.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, leaks in {{the mall}} roof and mold caused Elliot Lake city councilors to {{consider}} moving the Elliot Lake Public Library out of the mall {{and back to the}} Solomon Building, where it had been before 1992. Many books were damaged, despite library staff using tarps to cover shelves. At some points, entire sections were blocked for public health reasons. Much of the leaking was said to be corrected, before council considered the issue, and an environmental study was completed. Some library board members and councilors worried that liability insurance wouldn't cover them {{in the mall}}, despite reassurances by library management and the city's insurance broker. With a multi-use <b>complex</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> works, some of the library board was concerned with a five-year lease that mall management was pursuing, despite the library's preference for a 2.5-year lease. In the end, the library remained at the mall.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Wolgin began {{development}} of a two-tower high-rise <b>complex</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West Market Street neighborhood of Philadelphia. Existing structures at the site were demolished in 1969 after the city condemned the structures using eminent domain. With the project over budget, Centre Square was redesigned just before construction was scheduled to begin. Originally intended to be two steel high rises, the redesign used concrete instead. Unlike similar projects in the city, the entire complex was constructed all at once. The US$80-million Centre Square opened in 1973 with First Pennsylvania Bank as the lead tenant. Centre Square is credited with shifting Philadelphia's downtown office district from South Broad Street to West Market Street.|$|E

5|$|Malvern Theatres, {{housed in}} the Winter Gardens <b>complex</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town centre, is a provincial centre for the arts. The first Malvern Drama Festival, {{which took place in}} 1929, was {{dedicated}} to Bernard Shaw and planned by Sir Barry Jackson. A number of works have had their first performances at Malvern, six by Shaw including In Good King Charles's Golden Days, the 1929 English première of The Apple Cart, and the world première of Geneva in 1938. In 1956 Malvern held a Shaw centenary week. In February 1965 a Malvern Festival Theatre Trust was set up, and extensive refurbishment was undertaken. J B Priestley presided over the opening ceremony of the first summer season. In 1998, a further £7.2 million major redesign and refurbishment took place with the help of contributions from the National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF), administered by the government Department for Culture, Media and Sport.|$|E
5|$|Many {{improvements}} {{have occurred}} to the Route 3 freeway.

The bridge over the Berrys Creek, originally built in 1948, was reconstructed in the mid-1990s and Route 3 was widened to eight lanes in the area near the bridge.
