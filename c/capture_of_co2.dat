A Brønsted correlation relating the kinetic rate constants and equilibrium constants for the formation of carbamic acid/carbamates with the protonation constant of the amine is reported. Such a relationship facilitates an understanding of the effects of steric and electronic properties of the amine toward its reactivity with CO₂.

40|$|Empirical thesis. Bibliography: leaves 52 - 53. Chapter 1. Introduction [...] Chapter 2. Experimental [...] Chapter 3. Results and discussion. Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is an {{abundant}} greenhouse gas continually emitted {{into the atmosphere}} from both natural sources and anthropogenic sources including: fossil fuel combustion, fracking techniques, industrial materials production and land deforestation. Consequently, the natural carbon cycle is overridden leading to strong debates regarding global warming and climate change. The reduction of CO₂ to methane (CH₄), {{a process known as}} methanation, {{has been the subject of}} extensive study. However most approaches suffer from limitations including: use of sacrificial and expensive metal-based catalysts, high temperature and pressure requirements leading to incomplete reactions, resulting in CO and unreacted CO₂ products. Alternative approaches currently being suggested involve use of silane-based reducing reagents with Lewis acid type catalysts. Consequently this project focused on screening four silane-based reducing agents against B(C₆F₅) ₃, a B(C₆F₅) ₃/hindered amine tandem catalyst and B(C₆F₅) ₃ + tandem catalyst to determine the efficiencies of CH₄ formation and rates of reactions. Additionally, the continuous in situ regeneration of siloxane byproducts into silane reducing agents was investigated. The conversion of CO₂ to CH₄ holds significant potential for the chemical <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>CO₂</b> and storage of hydrogen in the form of CH₄ which has many applications including: commercial power stations, petrochemical refining and natural gas.

40|$|Post {{combustion}} <b>capture</b> <b>of</b> <b>CO₂</b> (PCC) {{is currently}} {{one of the}} leading technologies for the reduction of green house gas emissions from power plants. The most common PCC process is based on the absorption of CO₂ into aqueous amine solutions. CO₂ absorption involves several parallel reactions including hydration of CO₂; deprotonation of carbonic acid; protonation of the amine; and formation of carbamate. The extent to which each reaction proceeds is dependent on the conditions of absorption (or desorption), as well as the associated equilibrium constants. All reactions other than carbamate formation have been extensively investigated previously. The investigation of carbamate formation is more complex, as it cannot be studied in the absence of other, simultaneous reactions. In particular, the enthalpy of carbamate formation has been determined previously only from the temperature dependence of equilibrium constants, but this methodology is not robust. In this contribution, we use calorimetry and advanced model-based data analysis methods for the unravelling of the thermo-chemistry relevant to PCC and specifically directly determine the reaction enthalpy for carbamate formation. The reaction enthalpies of carbamate formation and amine protonation were measured in dilute aqueous solution at 298 K using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) for monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), and ammonia (NH₃). The enthalpy of protonation was also measured for carbonate and bicarbonate. The re-determined protonation constants of the carbonate species and the three amines are in excellent agreement with previously reported results. No measured enthalpies of carbamate formation have been reported previously. For the carbamate formation reaction HCO₃-+R'RNH↔R'RNCO₂-, the following reaction enthalpies were determined: MEA, - 29. 7 ± 0. 1 kJ/mol; DEA, - 23. 7 ± 0. 9 kJ/mol, and NH₃, - 27. 6 ± 0. 9 kJ/mol.
