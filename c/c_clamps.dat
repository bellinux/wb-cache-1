For luthiers who still choose to handcraft their instruments, methods have changed very little over the past 500 years. As more advanced tooling options become available, however, less of the work in manufacturing a guitar is necessary to complete by hand.

40|$|Project Completion Report, OWRT Project No. A- 091 -ARIZ / Agreement No. 14 - 34 - 0001 - 8003 / Project Dates: October 1978 - September 1979 / Acknowledgement: The work {{upon which}} {{this report is}} based was {{supported}} by funds provided by the United States Department of the Interior, Office of Water Research and Technology, as authorized under the Water Resources Research Act of 1978. This report contains {{the results of a}} one year study to develop improved methods of evaporation control using wax impregnated foam. The foam used was expanded polystyrene and the wax used was paraffin with a 140 ° F melting point. The report tells of a pressure chamber that was used to wax impregnate sheets of expanded polystyrene. Based on tests made in the laboratory the pressure chamber was modified into a vacuum chamber. Problems were encountered getting the interior of the sheets impregnated using a vacuum. There was no way this problem could have been predicted based on the smaller laboratory models. The pressure method, however, was successfully used to impregnate up to 3 -inch thick sheets of expanded polystyrene. During the project {{it was found that the}} paraffin impregnated rafts worked very well until high temperatures, 100 ° F plus, are encountered Under dusty conditions. The heat causes the surface of the wax to get tacky, the dust darkens the otherwise white surface, which in turn captures more heat, and then more dust, etc. The high surface temperature caused an accelerated weathering of the material. Because of this, waxes with higher melting points were tried. Additional work is needed in this area as no satisfactory combinations were found. Two polyethylene copolymers with a melting point close to the 190 ° F destruction point of the expanded polystyrene were tested. This wax was too viscous for impregnation but provided a hard surface coating when the previously wax impregnated expanded polystyrene is dipped into the molten polyethylene wax. This dipping might be the best method for surface protection at low cost but additional testing is needed before trying the material out on a large scale. Progress was made in the development of wax impregnated lightweight concrete rafts. The wax impregnation of the lightweight raft solves the vapor penetration problem. This type of raft was found to resist removal by wind and weathered very well in the one year of testing. Connecting rafts with strips of sheet metal bonded to the expanded polystyrene was done on a small scale, and needs to be field tested. The PVC pipe <b>C</b> <b>clamps</b> work well on partially submerged rafts but need to be lengthened to interconnect wax impregnated rafts. Square wax impregnated rafts lx 1 ft in size did not stay on a small test pond in high wind.

Analytical ultracentrifugation and gel filtration measurements demonstrated that UL 44 also forms a dimer in solution, and substitution of large hydrophobic residues along the homodimer interface with alanine disrupted dimerization and decreased DNA binding.

PF- 8, the presumed processivity factor of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus DNA polymerase, acts {{in combination with}} the catalytic subunit, Pol- 8, to synthesize viral DNA. We have solved the crystal structure of residues 1 to 304 of PF- 8 at a resolution of 2. 8 Å. This structure reveals that each monomer of PF- 8 shares a fold common to processivity factors. Like human cytomegalovirus UL 44, PF- 8 forms a head-to-head dimer {{in the form of a}} <b>C</b> <b>clamp,</b> with its concave face containing a number of basic residues that are predicted to be important for DNA binding. However, there are several differences with related proteins, especially in loops that extend from each monomer into the center of the <b>C</b> <b>clamp</b> and in the loops that connect the two subdomains of each protein, which may be important for determining PF- 8 's mode of binding to DNA and to Pol- 8. Using the crystal structures of PF- 8, the herpes simplex virus catalytic subunit, and RB 69 bacteriophage DNA polymerase in complex with DNA and initial experiments testing the effects of inhibition of PF- 8 -stimulated DNA synthesis by peptides derived from Pol- 8, we suggest a model for how PF- 8 might form a ternary complex with Pol- 8 and DNA.

However, there are still strong concerns about the increased cost of &OS routing, {{both in terms of}} more complex and frequent computations and increased routing protocol over-head. The main goals of this paper are to study these two cost components, and propose solutions that achieve good routing performance with reduced processing cost.

Using simulation, we study the relative significance of these factors and investigate the relationship between routing performance and the amount of update traf-fic.

Based on the con-clusions of these studies, we develop extensions to the basic QoS routing, that can achieve good routing performance with limited update generation rates.

40|$|Objective: Insulin {{resistance}} {{is a frequent}} consequence of GH replacement therapy but patients on GH replacement therapy often also have replacement of other hormone deficiencies which theoretically could modify the metabolic effects of GH. In particular, cortisol replacement if given in supra physio-logic doses immediately before the evaluation of insulin sensitivity could influence insulin sensitivity. The {{aim of this study}} was thus to evaluate the effect of morning cortisol replacement given prior to a euglycaemic clamp combined with infusion of [3 - 3 H]glucose and indirect calorimetry on glucose and lipid metabolism. Methods: Ten GH/ACTH-deficient adults received, in a double-blind manner, either cortisol (A) or pla-cebo (B) before the clamp whereas five GH-deficient–ACTH-sufficient adults participated in a control (<b>C)</b> <b>clamp</b> experiment. All subjects received GH replacement therapy. Results: Serum cortisol levels were significantly higher after cortisol than after placebo (324 ^ 156 vs 132 ^ 136 mmol/l; P 0. 006) and similar to controls (177 ^ 104 mmol/l). As a measure of the bio-logical effect of cortisol, eosinophil leukocyte counts in peripheral blood decreased (164 ^ 91 £ 109 /l vs 216 ^ 94 £ 109 /l; P 0. 04). Cortisol replacement had no significant effect on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (11. 8 ^ 1. 8 vs 13. 2 ^ 3. 9 mmol/kgmin), either on glucose oxidation or on glucose sto-rage. There was also no significant effect of cortisol on fasting endogenous glucose production and no effect was seen on serum free fatty acid concentrations.

Discriminant analysis, in which additional derivation/parameter combinations were added, increased the discriminative power of the Delta logP computation but not of the C or C-B computations. For isoflurane anesthesia, SEF 90 % was the best single parameter for distinguishing between patients who did and did not need a shunt and the four best derivations were F 3 -Cz, P 4 -Cz, C 4 -Cz, and F 7 -Cz. For the propofol anesthesia, the relative power (C or C-B computations) of the delta band was the best and the four best derivations were F 8 -Cz, T 4 -Cz, C 4 -Cz, and F 4 -Cz...|$|R
40|$|Natural-gas {{hydrates}} {{have been}} encountered beneath the permafrost and considered a drilling hazard {{by the oil}} and gas industry for years. Drilling engineers working in Russia, Canada and the USA have documented numerous problems, including drilling kicks and uncontrolled gas releases, in arctic regions. Information has been generated in laboratory studies pertaining to the extent, volume, chemistry and phase behavior of gas hydrates. Scientists studying hydrates as a potential energy source agree that the resource potential is great [...] on the North Slope of Alaska alone, it has been estimated at 590 TCF. However, little information has been obtained from physical samples taken from actual hydrate-bearing rocks. This gas-hydrate project is a cost-shared partnership between Maurer Technology, Anadarko Petroleum, Noble Corporation, and the U. S. Department of Energy's Methane Hydrate R&D program. The purpose of the project is to build on previous and ongoing R&D in the area of onshore hydrate deposition to identify, quantify and predict production potential for hydrates located on the North Slope of Alaska. The project team drilled and continuously cored the Hot Ice No. 1 well on Anadarko-leased acreage beginning in FY 2003 and completed in 2004. An on-site core analysis laboratory was built and used for determining physical characteristics of hydrates and surrounding rock. After the well was logged, a 3 D vertical seismic profile (VSP) was recorded to calibrate the shallow geologic section with seismic data and to investigate techniques to better resolve lateral subsurface variations of potential hydrate-bearing strata. Paulsson Geophysical Services, Inc. deployed their 80 level 3 <b>C</b> <b>clamped</b> borehole seismic receiver array in the wellbore to record samples every 25 ft. Seismic vibrators were successively positioned at 1185 different surface positions in a circular pattern around the wellbore. This technique generated a 3 D image of the subsurface. Correlations were generated of these seismic data with cores, logging, and other well data. Unfortunately, the Hot Ice No. 1 well did not encounter hydrates in the reservoir sands, although brine-saturated sands containing minor amounts of methane were encountered within the hydrate stability zone (HSZ). Synthetic seismograms created from well log data were in agreement with reflectivity data measured by the 3 D VSP survey. Modeled synthetic seismograms indicated a detectable seismic response would be expected in the presence of hydrate-bearing sands. Such a response was detected in the 3 D VSP data at locations up-dip to the west of the Hot Ice No. 1 wellbore. Results of this project suggest that the presence of hydrate-bearing strata may not be related as simply to HSZ thickness as previously thought. Geological complications of reservoir facies distribution within fluvial-deltaic environments will require sophisticated detection technologies to assess the locations of recoverable volumes of methane contained in hydrates. High-resolution surface seismic data and more rigorous well log data analysis offer the best near-term potential. The hydrate resource potential is huge, but better tools are needed to accurately assess their location, distribution and economic recoverability...|$|R
40|$|Borehole {{seismology}} is {{the highest}} resolution geophysical imaging technique available today to {{the oil and gas}} industry for characterization and monitoring of oil and gas reservoirs. However, the industry's ability to perform high resolution 3 D imaging of deep and complex gas reservoirs using borehole seismology has been hampered by the lack of acquisition technology necessary to record large volumes of high frequency, high signal-to-noise-ratio borehole seismic data. This project took aim at this shortcoming by developing a 400 level 3 <b>C</b> <b>clamped</b> downhole seismic receiver array, and accompanying software, for borehole seismic 3 D imaging. This large borehole seismic array has removed the technical acquisition barrier for recording the data volumes necessary to do high resolution 3 D VSP and 3 D cross-well seismic imaging. Massive 3 D VSP{reg_sign} and long range Cross-Well Seismology (CWS) are two of the borehole seismic techniques that promise to take the gas industry to the next level in their quest for higher resolution images of deep and complex oil and gas reservoirs. Today only a fraction of the oil or gas in place is produced when reservoirs are considered depleted. This is primarily due to our lack of understanding of detailed compartmentalization of oil and gas reservoirs. In this project, we developed a 400 level 3 C borehole seismic receiver array that allows for economic use of 3 D borehole seismic imaging for reservoir characterization and monitoring. This new array has significantly increased the efficiency of recording large data volumes at sufficiently dense spatial sampling to resolve reservoir complexities. The receiver pods have been fabricated and tested to withstand high temperature (200 C/ 400 F) and high pressure (25, 000 psi), so that they can operate in wells up to 7, 620 meters (25, 000 feet) deep. The receiver array is deployed on standard production or drill tubing. In combination with 3 C surface seismic or 3 C borehole seismic sources, the 400 level receiver array can be used to obtain 3 D 9 C data. These 9 C borehole seismic data provide both compressional wave and shear wave information that can be used for quantitative prediction of rock and pore fluid types. The 400 -level borehole receiver array has been deployed successfully in a number of oil and gas wells during the course of this project, and each survey has resulted in marked improvements in imaging of geologic features that are critical for oil or gas production but were previously considered to be below the limits of seismic resolution. This added level of reservoir detail has resulted in improved well placement in the oil and gas fields that have been drilled using the Massive 3 D VSP{reg_sign} images. In the future, the 400 -level downhole seismic receiver array is expected to continue to improve reservoir characterization and drilling success in deep and complex oil and gas reservoirs...|$|R

40|$|A {{study using}} the radial basis {{function}} (RBF) collocation method to analyze static deformations, free vibrations, and buckling loads of square cross-ply laminated plates using a sinus-based shear and normal deformation theory is presented, allowing for through-the-thickness deformations. The principle of virtual displacements {{is used to}} obtain the equations of motions and boundary conditions and the governing equations in strong form for the RBF method are observed. A simply supported square laminated plate of side a and thickness h, composed of four equally layers oriented at [0 / 90 / 90 / 0 °], is considered. It is found that the present mesh-less results are in very close agreement with the mesh-free results. The laminated plate is supported along the edges parallel to the x axis, while the other two edges may be simply supported (S) or <b>clamped</b> (<b>C).</b> An excellent agreement is achieved for all edge conditions when comparing the results obtained by the present RBF approach with those found earlier...|$|R

The definitionof magnetic response properties can therefore be recast as a sum of two formally “diamag-netic” terms for any molecule, including systems showing strong induced orbital param-agnetism.
