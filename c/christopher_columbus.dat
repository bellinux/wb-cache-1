The Spanish founded Santo Domingo on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in the 1490s. In the first decades after the discovery of the new lands, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{military}} {{was involved in the}} breeding of Arabian horses throughout Europe, particularly in Poland, Spain, Germany, and Russia; private breeders also developed a number of breeding programs. Significant among the private breeders in continental Europe was Spain's Cristóbal Colón de Aguilera, XV Duque de Veragua, a direct descendant of <b>Christopher</b> <b>Columbus,</b> who founded the Veragua Stud in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|SS <b>Christopher</b> <b>Columbus</b> carried 1.7–2 million {{passengers}} {{in her first}} year alone, and is estimated to have carried more passengers than any other vessel on the Great Lakes.

50|$|Valiant {{scholars}} have dedicated {{themselves to the}} subject of <b>Christopher</b> <b>Columbus's</b> language. They have conducted in-depth research both on the ship's log and on other of his writings that have come down to us. They have analyzed the words, the terms, and the vocabulary, as well as rather frequent variations often bizarre in style, handwriting, grammar, and syntax. <b>Christopher</b> <b>Columbus's</b> language is Castilian punctuated by noteworthy and frequent Lusitanian, Italian, and Genoese influences and elements.|$|R
5|$|The Columbian half {{dollar is}} a coin {{issued by the}} Bureau of the Mint in 1892 and 1893. The first United States {{commemorative}} coin, it was issued both {{to raise funds for}} the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition and to mark the quadricentennial of the first voyage to the Americas of <b>Christopher</b> <b>Columbus,</b> whose portrait it bears. The Columbian half dollar was the first American coin to depict a historical person.|$|E
5|$|The Jewish {{immigration}} to Puerto Rico {{began in the}} 15th century {{with the arrival of}} the anusim (variously called conversos, Crypto-Jews, Secret Jews or marranos) who accompanied <b>Christopher</b> <b>Columbus</b> on his second voyage. An open Jewish community did not flourish in the colony because Judaism was prohibited by the Spanish Inquisition. However, many migrated to mountainous parts of the island, far from the central power of San Juan, and continued to self-identify as Jews and practice Crypto-Judaism.|$|E
5|$|The Knights of Columbus is the world's largest Catholic fraternal service organization. Founded by Father Michael J.

5|$|To fix the {{problems}} at Fort Jackson, Alexander recommended the addition of an artillery section, a second company of infantry, and various improvements to the fort itself. Spurred {{in part by the}} Confederate attack on Fort Stevens north of Washington, several improvements were made, including the restoration of gates that had been removed when the railroad line was constructed. Gen. <b>Christopher</b> <b>Columbus</b> Augur, commander of the Department of Washington, recommended that Fort Jackson be assigned two light guns as armament during the reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|A {{suitable}} environment {{had developed}} to question scientific doctrine. The discovery in 1492 of the New World by <b>Christopher</b> <b>Columbus</b> challenged the classical worldview. The works of Ptolemy (in geography) and Galen (in medicine) {{were found to}} not always match everyday observations. As the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation clashed, the Northern Renaissance showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine). The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted {{in a period of}} major scientific advancements.|$|E
5|$|Cabral was not {{the first}} European to stumble upon areas of present-day Brazil, not to mention other parts of South America. Roman coins have been found in today's Venezuela, {{northwest}} of Brazil, presumably from ships that were carried away by storm in ancient times. Norsemen reached North America and even established settlements, though these ended in failure sometime {{before the end of the}} 15th century. <b>Christopher</b> <b>Columbus,</b> on his third voyage to the New World in 1498, traveled along part of what would later become Venezuela.|$|E
50|$|On 4 November 1493, <b>Christopher</b> <b>Columbus's</b> second voyage {{unloaded}} there. Columbus {{would have}} met Amerindians. To commemorate this event, {{a bust of}} the navigator was raised in 1916 at the entry of Sainte-Marie.|$|R

5|$|Lettuce {{appears in}} many medieval writings, {{especially}} as a medicinal herb. Hildegard of Bingen mentioned {{it in her}} writings on medicinal herbs between 1098 and 1179, and many early herbals also describe its uses. In 1586, Joachim Camerarius provided descriptions of the three basic modern lettuces– head lettuce, loose-leaf lettuce, and romaine (or cos) lettuce. Lettuce was first brought to the Americas from Europe by <b>Christopher</b> <b>Columbus</b> in the late 15th century. Between the late 16th century and the early 18th century, many varieties were developed in Europe, particularly Holland. Books published in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries describe several varieties found in gardens today.|$|E
