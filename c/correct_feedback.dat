40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the types of}} feedbacks made by EFL students in a writing class. A number of 25 students essays were collected and analysed. The results revealed {{that a number of}} 61 responding feedbacks were found in the types of support, sharing knowledge, negotiation, appreciation and criticism. Meanwhile, 142 <b>correcting</b> <b>feedbacks</b> were found in the types of coded, uncoded, a combination of coded and uncoded and direct answer. The type most used in responding feedback was support, which indicates that it is an important pursuit in these students learning to drive each other into improving their writing skills with confidence. Whilst the least used was criticism, and this indicates that it was not considerably favoured to be given in the peer correction feedbacks since they restrain encouragement and cause social anxiety. The type most used in <b>correcting</b> <b>feedbacks</b> was a combination of coded and uncoded. This signifies that to provide both mark and symbol on an error can avoid confusion between the student corrector and the student writer.

The results also reveal that participants did not hyper'correct' on the immediate test when they had made a correct response with high confidence but were then given false feedback.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} biased feedback on decision and learning processes in a vernier discrimination task. Subjects adjust their decision criteria and hence their responses according to biased external feedback. However, they do not use learning processes to encode incorrectly classified stimuli.

If the external feedback is switched off instead of being corrected, the rebound is less vigorous. The findings contradict predictions of supervised neural network models...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{variations}} in signal probability and {{varying degrees of}} <b>correct</b> <b>feedback</b> on response bias were studied in a yes-no auditory signal detection task. The main finding was that the bias towards saying yes was an increasing function of the frequency of signal feedback events, but did {{not depend on the}} correctness of the feedback. Several learning models coupled with a simple psychophysical and decision model yielded predictions about overall biases and certain sequential statistics. Only one model, which can be described as an "informational " model, gave a good account of both observed overall biases and sequential statistics. This model assumes the observer's response bias is strengthened for the feedback-reinforced response when the observer's sensory information is ambiguous or is contradicted by the feedback information. This report presents an empirical and theoretical analysis of the effects of informational feedback variables and signal-presentation probabilities on response bias in a yes-no auditory detection task. The general approach is similar to that employed by Atkinson and Kinchla (1965) for forced-choice tasks, though we use a broader range of informational variables and theoretical models. Our primary interest is in the effects of varying degrees of <b>correct</b> <b>feedback</b> on response bias. The main theoretical analysis compares a number of learning models for response bias.

40|$|The hypercorrection effect {{refers to}} the finding that high-confidence errors {{are more likely to}} be <b>corrected</b> after <b>feedback</b> than are low-confidence errors (Butterfield & Metcalfe, 2001). In 5 {{experiments}} I examine the hypercorrection effect, offer possible explanations for why the effect occurs, and examine the durability of the effect. In Experiment 1, I replicate the hypercorrection effect and show that delaying the feedback does not reduce the effect. In a secondary item analysis I also show that the effect is not caused by "tricky" questions. In Experiments 2 and 3, I show that subjects are more likely to remember the source of the feedback after both high-confidence errors and low-confidence correct responses. This suggests that it is the discrepancy between the subject's expectation and the actual feedback that causes the hypercorrection effect. In Experiment 4 I show that the hypercorrection effect also occurs for episodic false memories showing the diversity of the effect. Finally, in Experiment 5 I examine the durability of the effect.

30|$|First, {{these data}} show {{that it is not}} the case that the {{correction}} of misinformation is indistinguishable from misinforming people at the expense of previously held correct beliefs. In all five experiments, participants hypercorrected when they had made an error and were given <b>correct</b> <b>feedback</b> to remember. In none of the five experiments did participants hyper'correct' when they had originally been correct and were given false feedback to remember. These results are the first to show empirically that individuals respond differentially, regardless of confidence, as a function of whether they were initially correct or incorrect. They also suggest that people may be able to use second-order knowledge concerning their own metacognitive confidence judgments (Buratti et al., 2013; Dunlosky, Serra, Matvey, & Rawson, 2005).|$|E
40|$|The {{congestion}} control algorithm of TCP relies on <b>correct</b> <b>feedback</b> from {{the receiver to}} determine {{the rate at which}} packets should be sent into the network. Hence, correct receiver feedback (in the form of TCP acknowledgements) is essential to the goal of sharing the scarce bandwidth resources fairly and avoiding congestion collapse in the Internet. However, the assumption that a TCP receiver can always be trusted (to generate feedback correctly) no longer holds as there are plenty of incentives for a receiver to deviate from the protocol. In fact, {{it has been shown that}} a misbehaving receiver (whose aim is to bring about congestion collapse) can easily generate acknowledgements to conceal packet loss, so as to drive a number of honest, innocent senders arbitrarily fast to create a significant number of non-responsive packet flows, leading to denial of service to other Internet users. We give the first formal treatment to this problem. We also give an efficient, provably secure mechanism to force a receiver to generate feedback correctly; any incorrect acknowledgement will be detected at the sender and cheating TCP receivers would be identified. The idea is as follows: for each packet sent, the sender generates a tag using a secret key (known to himself only); the receiver could generate a proof using the packet and the tag alone, and send it to the sender; the sender can then verify the proof using the secret key; an incorrect proof would indicate a cheating receiver. The scheme is very efficient in the sense that the TCP sender does not need to store the packet or the tag, and the proofs for multiple packets can be aggregated at the receiver. The scheme is based on an aggregate authenticator. In addition, the proposed solution can be applied to network-layer rate-limiting architectures requiring <b>correct</b> <b>feedback...</b>|$|E

40|$|The higher {{education}} landscape {{in developing countries}} is faced with many challenges, {{one of which is}} high faculty to student ratio. An obvious implication of this is compromise on the quality of classroom engagement. The distractions caused by the not conducive learning space and instructors’ inability to elucidate <b>correct</b> <b>feedbacks</b> from students usually lead to poor learning outcomes. Feedback mechanisms that are unobtrusive and efficient in processing large data in real-time are needful to measure quality learning experience in such large classroom settings. With the latest impact of penetration and adoption of internet and mobile technologies in most developing counties, wearable technology is a feasible solution to manage and monitor classroom involvement; as real time student feedback can be integrated in the design and delivery of instruction {{in and out of the}} classroom. In this paper, we present state of the art of wearable technology and explored the opportunities of wearable technology in the {{higher education}}. Specifically, we presented scenarios in which wearable technology can be employed to understand and analyze physiological signals and emotional responses from learners in real-time; the end result of which would increase the quality of classroom engagement, inspire new pedagogy, drive new trends in peer-to-peer collaborations, and increase the learning outcomes. Moreover, we identified some challenges that may hinder this development such as: inconclusive user studies of wearable technology in developing countries and inadequate infrastructure.

Providing feedback that is uncorrelated to the observers' responses prevents learning, while the effect of block feedback does not differ significantly from complete feedback.
