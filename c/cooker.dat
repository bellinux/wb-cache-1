5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} <b>cooker</b> {{to accelerate the}} process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the <b>cooker,</b> lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} <b>cooker.</b> Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} pressure <b>cooker,</b> and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.|$|E

5|$|As the geyser fills, {{the water}} {{at the top of}} the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, {{convective}} cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike the lid of a pressure <b>cooker,</b> allowing the water in the reservoir to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.|$|E

5|$|As well as food, camping equipment, and dog-care gear, mushers {{must carry}} an axe, a cold-weather {{sleeping}} bag, {{a pair of}} snowshoes, veterinary records, Quest promotional material, a <b>cooker,</b> and eight booties per dog. Included in the required promotional material are numerous event covers intended to reflect the Quest's ancestry as a mail route. One unusual rule requires mushers to immediately butcher any game animal killed during the race. This rule was applied in 1993, when a musher was attacked by a moose and killed it to protect himself.|$|E
5|$|When being cooked, {{fried chicken}} is often divided into smaller pieces. The chicken is then {{generally}} {{covered in a}} batter, often consisting of ingredients such as eggs or milk, and a thickener such as flour. This is {{used to create a}} crust on the exterior of the meat. In addition, seasoning is often added at this stage. Once the chicken is ready to be cooked, it is placed in a deep fryer, frying pan or pressure <b>cooker</b> (depending on the method used) and fried in lard or a type of oil.|$|E
5|$|Letting bean dip {{sit for a}} {{while before}} serving can {{increase}} the intermingling of flavors in the dish. Bean dip can be served cold, at room temperature, or as a hot dish. Hot bean dip can be prepared ahead of time, refrigerated and then cooked at a later time, and can also be prepared using a slow <b>cooker</b> and served in the appliance. Bean dip can be prepared as a vegan and gluten-free dish. The dish is typically served with tortilla chips, and can also be served with crackers, crudités, breadsticks, pita bread and toasted bread such as baguette.|$|E

5|$|The cousins {{went back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to search for the source of the red paint on the silencer. In the kitchen they found marks in the red paint {{on the underside of the}} mantelpiece above the Aga <b>cooker.</b> DI Cook, a scenes-of-crime officer, took a paint sample from the mantelpiece on 14 August. This was found to contain the same 15 layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on the silencer. Casts were taken of the marks on the mantel, and the marks were deemed consistent with the silencer having come into contact several times with the mantelpiece. The implication was that the silencer had scratched the mantelpiece during a fight for the gun.|$|E
5|$|The party's ski boots, {{specially}} designed by Amundsen, were {{the product of}} two years' testing and modification in search of perfection. The party's polar clothing included suits of sealskin from Northern Greenland, and clothes fashioned after {{the style of the}} Netsilik Inuit from reindeer skins, wolf skin, Burberry cloth and gabardine. The sledges were constructed from Norwegian ash with steel-shod runners made from American hickory. Skis, also fashioned from hickory, were extra long to reduce the likelihood of slipping into crevasses. The tents—"the strongest and most practical that have ever been used"—had built-in floors and required a single pole. For cooking on the march, Amundsen chose the Swedish Primus stove rather than the special <b>cooker</b> devised by Nansen, because he felt the latter took up too much space.|$|E
5|$|At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu {{is selling}} items to {{customers}} at outrageous prices, like normal. Apu scribbles out the 1989 expiration date on {{a package of}} ham and then lowers the price instead of throwing it out. Homer buys the meat, eats it, and contracts food poisoning. After recovering, Homer returns to the Kwik-E-Mart to complain, and Apu gives him two five-pound buckets of expired shrimp to placate him. Homer eats the shrimp and becomes ill again. Whilst recovering at home, Homer sees the Channel 6 investigative news program Bite Back with Kent Brockman. Lisa gives him the idea to get the show to investigate the Kwik-E-Mart. Kent gives Homer a giant novelty hat containing a spy camera to expose Apu for selling expired food. Though Homer almost immediately abandons the hat after mistaking the buzzing of the machinery as a bee, the camera catches Apu placing a hot dog that he had dropped on the ground back into the hot dog <b>cooker.</b> Apu is immediately fired by his company (even though he was actually following company policy), and is replaced by actor James Woods, who is doing research for a role in an upcoming film.|$|E
50|$|Pressure <b>cookers</b> are {{typically}} made of aluminum (aluminium) or stainless steel.

Rice for a mid-day meal might be started early in the morning, with vegetables, cheese, or soup added to the solar <b>cooker</b> {{in the middle of the}} morning.

25|$|The {{simplest}} type {{of solar}} <b>cooker</b> is the box <b>cooker</b> first built by Horace de Saussure in 1767.

25|$|SCI {{developed}} the CooKit as {{an adaptation of}} a <b>cooker</b> designed by Dr. Roger Bernard in France.

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{research}} project show that solar <b>cookers</b> can be introduced and distributed successfully in countries with severe problems {{in the field of}} energy (firewood) supply. However, a precondition is that these solar <b>cookers</b> are adjusted {{to the needs of the}} corresponding user group. The most important adjustments are: The users must be able to prepare their traditional meals with solar <b>cookers</b> without having to change their cooking habits. The handling of solar <b>cookers</b> must be simple and without any risks. Another important aspect for the acceptance and distribution of solar <b>cookers</b> is the acquisition price of the systems. The manufacturing of solar <b>cookers</b> in these countries is essential for the reduction of the acquisition price. This would be a possible solution in several countries. Thus a network of manufacturers would be established which enabled the distribution of solar <b>cookers</b> area-wide. The current field test program run by GTZ in South Africa aims at the same target. Seven different solar <b>cookers</b> (amongst others those described in chapter 3. 2 and 3. 3) at various locations (small and large families, institutes) are tested. The solar <b>cookers</b> which have been accepted the most by the users are supposed to be manufactured locally after the completion of the field test phase.

25|$|A box <b>cooker</b> has a {{transparent}} glass or plastic top, {{and it may}} have additional reflectors to concentrate sunlight into the box. The top can usually be removed to allow dark pots containing food to be placed inside. One or more reflectors of shiny metal or foil-lined material may be positioned to bounce extra light into the interior of the oven chamber. Cooking containers and the inside bottom of the <b>cooker</b> should be dark-colored or black. Inside walls should be reflective to reduce radiative heat loss and bounce the light towards the pots and the dark bottom, which is in contact with the pots. The box should have insulated sides. Thermal insulation for the solar box <b>cooker</b> must be able to withstand temperatures up to 150°C (300°F) without melting or out-gassing. Crumpled newspaper, wool, rags, dry grass, sheets of cardboard, etc. can be used to insulate the walls of the <b>cooker.</b> Metal pots and/or bottom trays can be darkened either with flat-black spray paint (one that is non-toxic when warmed), black tempera paint, or soot from a fire. The solar box <b>cooker</b> typically reaches a temperature of 150°C (300°F). This is not as hot as a standard oven, but still hot enough to cook food over a somewhat longer period of time.|$|E
