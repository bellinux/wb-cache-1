40|$|A {{very high}} number of {{different}} types of blood cells must be generated daily through a process called haematopoiesis {{in order to meet the}} physiological requirements of the organism. All blood cells originate from a population of relatively few haematopoietic stem cells residing in the bone marrow, which give rise to specific progenitors through different lineages. Steady-state dynamics are governed by cell division and <b>commitment</b> <b>rates</b> as well as by population sizes, while feedback components guarantee the restoration of steady-state conditions. In this study, all parameters governing these processes were estimated in a computational model to describe the haematopoietic hierarchy in adult mice. The model consisted of ordinary differential equations and included negative feedback regulation. A combination of literature data, a novel divide et impera approach for steady-state calculations and stochastic optimization allowed one to reduce possible configurations of the system. The model was able to recapitulate the fundamental steady-state features of haematopoiesis and simulate the re-establishment of steady-state conditions after haemorrhage and bone marrow transplantation. This computational approach to the haematopoietic system is novel and provides insight into the dynamics and the nature of possible solutions, with potential applications in both fundamental and clinical research...|$|R

40|$|Twenty {{states and}} the federal {{government}} have adopted statutes that authorize the post-incarceration commitment of sexually violent predators. Actuarial risk assessment is commonly used, and in some states statutorily required, to assess the risk of sexual recidivism in these proceedings.

Although this approach is controversial and courts almost uniformly permit it, the effect of this practice on fact finders is unknown. This experiment found that adjusting actuarial risk estimates affected mock-jurors’ decisions to commit a respondent, but only when the adjustment increased the risk estimate. Adjusting the risk estimate downwards did not decrease the <b>commitment</b> <b>rate.</b> Notably, this effect occurred without the expert providing any rationale for the adjustment. Further analyses suggest that participants engaged in motivated reasoning, which refers to the tendency to selectively credit or discredit information depending on whether it is congenial to the desired outcome.

Drawing upon findings of narratives of 10 primary and secondary school teachers with different years of experience and coming from six different countries, this work provides empirical evidence about which factors are motivating teachers for their work, how does teachers’ motivation evolve during their career, and how school leaders’ leadership practices influence teachers’ motivation. Findings show three different types of motivation to enhance a teaching career: altruistic, intrinsic and extrinsic motivations.

Version: FinalThe Maltese development pattern is influenced by the typical features of small island states: scarce natural resources, high density of population, lack of critical mass in infrastructure investment, high external dependency etc. These features have an impact on transport, the environment and the sustainability of tourism and make it necessary to strengthen the Island’s knowledge-based economy in order to promote competitiveness. EU Cohesion Policy contributes considerably to tackling these issues through support from the ERDF and Cohesion Fund, while the Island participates in cross-border, trans-national and interregional cooperation programmes. The priorities of these programmes are highly complementary and consistent with the key development challenges: the support is concentrated mainly on sustainable development and environmental protection, (e. g. waste management and water treatment plants), knowledge and innovation as well as transport. Malta has been allocated EUR 728 million of ERDF and Cohesion Fund for the 2007 - 2013 period. Environment-related investment represents a key priority and accounts for 38 % of the total allocation; 25 % of the total ERDF has been allocated to accessibility and transport; around 22 % has been allotted to territorial development and 13 % to support enterprise environment. The overall <b>commitment</b> <b>rate</b> as at end 2009 amounted to around 50 % of total funding allocated and during 2009 there were 229 projects (including aid schemes) being implemented. In 2009 the Programme started producing its first outputs and results on the ground: first signs of construction of infrastructure; equipment being procured and s mobilisation of much needed support for enterprises. The recent economic crisis did not change the strategy and the objectives of the OP, which are arguably well suited for fostering the upturn in the economy, thanks to the focus on transport infrastructure, environment, energy territorial development (including tourism) and enterprise support. To boost investment in enterprises and mitigate the consequences of the crisis, in some cases, the allocation of the funds was diverted from public infrastructure to private sector support (e. g. EUR 12 million were allocated to a number of aid schemes for firms, focusing on e-business development, R&D, international competitiveness, innovation and energy). Evidence on performance of intervention is limited and it is too early to identify examples of good practice. The Mid-Term Evaluation of the ERDF OP is currently being carried out and some results can be expected by the end of the year. The ex ante evaluation of the OP, carried out initially, is mostly an analysis of the coherence of the strategy and did not attempt to assess the potential effects of the programme. An analysis of the effectiveness of projects co-financed by the Structural Funds in 2004 - 2006 examined the achievements of a sample of 13 initiatives, focusing mainly on recommendations for the future in terms of monitoring and collection of data. Some of the main future challenges facing EU Cohesion Policy include: continue to tackle the lack of innovation and entrepreneurial culture and increase the capacity of Malta to generate research and apply new technologies; increase awareness of environmental problems among people and implement larger projects with a significant impact on environmental protection; develop an evaluation culture to systematically assess the performance of policy; improve cooperation between administrative bodiesN/...|$|E

Escape dynamics recurrently propel {{away from a}} self-confirming equilibrium. In a model with a unique self-confirming equilibrium, the escape dynamics make the government discover too strong {{a version of the}} natural rate hypothesis. The escape route dynamics cause recurrent outcomes close to the Ramsey (<b>commitment)</b> inflation <b>rate</b> in a model with an adaptive government.

40|$|Mean {{dynamics}} govern convergence to {{rational expectations}} equilibria of self-referential systems under least squares learning. We highlight escape dynamics that propel {{away from a}} rational expectations equilibrium under fixed-gain recursive learning schemes. These learning schemes discount past observations. In a model with a unique self-confirming equilibrium, we show that the destination of the escape dynamics is an outcome associated with government discovery of too strong {{a version of the}} natural rate hypothesis. That destination is not sustainable as a self-confirming equilibrium but is visited recurrently. The escape route dynamics cause recurrent outcomes close to the Ramsey (<b>commitment)</b> inflation <b>rate</b> in a model with an adaptive government. JEL Classification: E 3, E 52, E 58...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares {{monetary}} policy of currency boards {{with that of}} the franc zone during the period 1956 - 2005. It concludes that {{monetary policy}} in the zone was more autonomous than under a currency board, even though both systems faced the same exchange rate constraint. So far, the contingency line provided by the French treasury and capital controls have allowed the zone to combine a fixed exchange rate and a relatively autonomous monetary policy. Financial development and zone enlargement would challenge this relative autonomy for two reasons: (1) the potential cost to the French treasury would increase; and (2) residents would potentially be able to avoid capital controls. For the zone to maintain its fixed exchange rate, close targeting of foreign reserves would become important.
