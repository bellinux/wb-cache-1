40|$|Given a nondegenerate {{sesquilinear}} {{inner product}} on a finite dimensional complex vector space, or a nondegenerate symmetric or skewsymmetric inner product on finite dimensional real vector space, subspaces that are simultaneously Lagrangian and invariant for a selfadjoint or a skewadjoint matrix {{with respect to}} the inner product are considered. The rate of <b>conditional</b> <b>stability</b> of such subspaces is studied, under small perturbations of both the inner product and the matrix.

Instead of using abstract operator theory, the new results are obtained by direct calculations involving the nonlocal operator L, something that gives us the bounds and estimates needed for the method of concentration-compactness...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For a {{sequence}} of values of the total horizontal impulse that converges to 0, there are solitary waves that minimise the energy in a given neighbourhood of the origin in W 2, 2 (R). The problem arises {{in the framework of}} the classical Euler equation when a two-dimensional layer of water above an infinite horizontal bottom is considered, at the surface of which solitary waves propagate under the action of gravity and weak surface tension. The adjective “weak ” refers to the Bond number, which is assumed to be sub-critical (< 1 / 3). This extends previous results on the <b>conditional</b> energetic <b>stability</b> of solitary waves in the super-critical case, namely those by A. Mielke ([7]) and by the author ([1]). Like in the latter, the method is based on di-rect minimisation and concentrated compactness, but without relying on “strict sub-additivity”, which is still unsettled in the present case. Instead, a complete and careful analysis of minimising sequences is performed that allows us to reach a conclusion, based only on the non-existence of “vanish-ing ” minimising sequences. However, in contrast with [1], we are unable to prove the existence of minimisers for all small values of the total horizontal impulse. In fact more is needed to get stability, namely that every minimising sequence has a subsequence that converges to a global minimiser, after possible shifts in the horizontal direction. This will be obtained as a con-sequence of the analysis of minimising sequences. Then exactly the same argument as in [1] gives <b>conditional</b> energetic <b>stability</b> and is therefore not repeated...|$|R
