40|$|This paper {{describes}} the technical approach and initial {{results of a}} test program for studying two-phase annular flow under the simulated microgravity conditions of KC- 135 aircraft flights. A helical coil flow channel orientation was utilized in order to circumvent the restrictions normally associated with drop tower or aircraft flight tests with respect to two-phase flow, namely spatial restrictions preventing channel lengths of sufficient size to accurately measure pressure drops. Additionally, the helical coil geometry is of interest in itself, considering that operating in a microgravity environment vastly simplifies the two-phase flows occurring in coiled flow channels under 1 -g conditions for virtually any orientation. Pressure drop measurements were made across four stainless steel <b>coil</b> <b>test</b> sections, having a range of inside tube diameters (0. 95 to 1. 9 cm), coil diameters (25 - 50 cm), and length-to-diameter ratios (380 - 720).

It {{is well known that}} the helium price increases rapidly and this tendency most probably will continue for a long time, as the demand of helium grows faster than its production. The utilization of heat-exchange gas considerably reduces many problems, that arise in the design of completely dry LTS magnets. The goal was to decrease or even completely avoid the consumption of rather expensive liquid helium for testing the laboratory size Nb-Ti and Nb 3 Sn coils including their training process.
