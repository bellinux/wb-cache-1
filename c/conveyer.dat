For the Loud Tour, Rihanna performed the song on [...] "a levitating, rotating platform, a <b>conveyer</b> belt and graffiti-laden car shell." [...] Although Kitty Empire described [...] "Man Down" [...] as [...] "terrific", the critic felt let down by the [...] "baffling lack of creativity" [...] from Rihanna's production team for the stage set up during Rihanna's performance. She wrote {{that she did not}} understand why a truck bonnet {{was in the middle of}} the stage. Maza praised the tracks placement on the set-list. [...] "Man Down" [...] was performed as the fourth song on the Loud Tour, following its opener [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", [...] "Disturbia" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Drive". Maza noted that the tempo of [...] "Man Down" [...] should have [...] "slowed down the momentum she'd accumulated until then but that was instead an ideal marriage of production and performance." [...] Instead, the red lights on the stage played up the [...] "ominous" [...] tone of the song as it gradually increased its tempo to the point whereby the end of the song was on the verge of sounding like an incantation.|$|E
2500|$|Glover {{originally}} {{worked in}} city administration working on community development before transitioning to theater. He has said:I didn't {{think it was}} a difficult transition. Acting is a platform that can become a <b>conveyer</b> for ideas. Art is a way of understanding, of confronting issues and confronting your own feelings—all within that realm of the capacity it represents. It may have been a leap of faith for me, given not only my learning disability (dyslexia) but also the fact that I felt awkward. I felt all the things that someone that's 6'3" [...] or 6'4" [...] feels and with my own diminished expectations of who I could be [...] would feel. Whether it's art, acting or theater that I've devoted myself to I put more passion and more energy into it.His first theater involvement was with the American Conservatory Theater, a regional training program in San Francisco. Glover also trained with Jean Shelton at the Shelton Actors Lab in San Francisco. In an interview on Inside the Actors Studio, Glover credited Jean Shelton for much of his development as an actor. Deciding {{that he wanted to be}} an actor, Glover resigned from his city administration job and soon began his career as a stage actor. Glover then moved to Los Angeles for more opportunities in acting, where he would later go on to co-found the Robey Theatre Company with actor Ben Guillory in honor of the actor and concert singer Paul Robeson in Los Angeles in 1994.|$|E

(Psa. 104:16) So then, he that nameth the name of Christ by way of applying to himself his benefits, and as counting that he is found of God in him, and so abideth, ought himself to walk even as he walked, that he may give proof of what he saith to be true, by bearing forth before men that similitude of righteousness that is in his root and stem: for such as the stock or tree is, such let the branches be, but that cannot be known but by the fruit: 'ye shall know them by their fruit.'

60|$|It will {{be noticed}} that in skeletonizing {{a list of}} the qualities which have carried her to the dizzy summit which she occupies, I have not {{mentioned}} the power which was the commanding force employed in achieving that lofty flight. It did not belong in that list; it was a force that was not a detail of her character, but was an outside one. It was the power which proceeded from her people's recognition of her as a supernatural personage, <b>conveyer</b> of the Latest Word, and divinely commissioned to deliver it to the world. The form which such a recognition takes, consciously or unconsciously, is worship; and worship does not question nor criticize, it obeys. The object of it does not need to coddle it, bribe it, beguile it, reason with it, convince it--it commands it; that is sufficient; the obedience rendered is not reluctant, but prompt and whole-hearted. Admiration for a Napoleon, confidence in him, pride in him, affection for him, can lift him high and carry him far; and these are forms of worship, and are strong forces, but they are worship of a mere human being, after all, and are infinitely feeble, as compared with those that are generated by that other worship, the worship of a divine personage. Mrs. Eddy has this efficient worship, this massed and centralized force, this force which is indifferent to opposition, untroubled by fear, and goes to battle singing, like Cromwell's soldiers; and while she has it she can command and it will obey, and maintain her on her throne, and extend her empire.|$|E

And I say, I am very confident, that though this be made light of now, yet the time is coming when many poor souls will rue the day that ever they did speak with a tongue. O, will one say, that I should so disregard my tongue! O that I, when I said so and so, had before bitten off my tongue!

40|$|Dense phase {{pneumatic}} <b>conveying</b> {{can be a}} most reliable, efficient {{method for}} handling a remarkably wide range of dry bulk solids. Some advantages {{of this type of}} <b>conveying</b> method include high solids/gas ratio, low <b>conveying</b> velocity, thus low power consumption, low product degradation and low pipe wear. However, {{due to the nature of}} discontinuous flow of dense phase <b>conveying,</b> the modeling and controlling of this type of <b>conveying</b> seems to be very difficult if assuming some type of steady state conditions for prediction. This paper will report the research on the transient behaviour of the slug movements through a horizontal pipeline in slug flow pneumatic <b>conveying.</b> The first step of this research is to obtain the fundamental theory for the pressure differential of the system <b>conveying</b> pressure when there is only one slug traveling in the pipeline. In the theory, both instant slug movements and air conservation law were considered. For the next step, by applying this fundamental pressure differential equation, pressure drop models for multiple slugs <b>conveying</b> conditions were proposed by either assuming uniform slug condition or normal distribution slug condition. Finally, the proposed pressure drop models were verified with experimental data and showed the capability of numerically tracing the transient <b>conveying</b> pressure of the dense phase <b>conveying</b> system, i. e. the pressure-time profile of the simulated <b>conveying</b> case. The pressure drop models and transient simulation software derived from these models can be used for predicting operating parameters and slug behaviour within the horizontal slug flow pneumatic <b>conveying</b> system, and have the potential to significantly increase slug <b>conveying</b> efficiency. They can also be used as a controlling algorithm for the control unit of an industrial <b>conveying</b> system...|$|R

40|$|Pneumatic <b>conveying</b> {{has many}} {{noteworthy}} capabilities, and hence its popularity, but it generally has a perceived mystery {{in terms of}} reliable operation. The mode of flow of a material in a pipeline, for example, is often misunderstood, and likewise the influence and role of {{the properties of the}} material to be <b>conveyed</b> are not fully appreciated. With so many materials being either abrasive or friable there is a demand for systems that will <b>convey</b> materials at low velocity, apart from the constant need to minimise power requirements. A low velocity system is generally considered to be more economical to operate than a high velocity dilute phase <b>conveying</b> system. The requirement, therefore, is often for a low velocity dense phase <b>conveying</b> system, regardless of the material to be <b>conveyed</b> and the distance over which it is required to be <b>conveyed.</b> The value of the <b>conveying</b> air velocity required to <b>convey</b> a material is critical to the successful operation of pneumatic <b>conveying</b> systems and this is considered in detail. The lowest value possible will minimise problems of erosive wear and particle degradation in all cases. The power requirements for the <b>conveying</b> system will also be minimised, but the influence on the flow rate of the material is not so predictable. There is, in virtually all cases, a minimum value of <b>conveying</b> air velocity that must be maintained if the system is to operate successfully.
