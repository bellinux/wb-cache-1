40|$|Issue: Ferrous metal {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{contaminants}} in recovered wood waste supplies. Ferrous metal are found in <b>crates,</b> <b>pallets,</b> and construction and demolition debris in the form of nails, screws, staples, or other hardware. These contaminants can create problems for the processor and end user alike. High value manufacturing feedstock specifications require that wood waste products be essentially free of ferrous metal contaminants. Removing ferrous metals from wood waste is critical to wood waste recovery. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends using magnetic separators to remove ferrous metals from recovered wood waste. The following types of magnetic separation devices are described below: Stationary, Non Self-Cleaning Suspended Magnets: These are large permanent plate or electro-magnets designed to be suspended over a conveyor belt. These stationary, non self-cleaning magnets pull tramp metal out of wood waste as it passes underneath. To avoid excessive clean-up, the suspended magnets should be installed in areas where tramp metal volume is relatively small. So, they are generally inefficient for most applications at a wood waste processing facility. Since the overhead magnets work against gravity, they must be stronger than magnets underneath material flow. Self-Cleaning Suspended Magnets: A large permanent plate or electro-magnet. The self-cleaning varietie...|$|R
40|$|Issue: One of {{the most}} common {{contaminants}} of recovered wood waste supplies is ferrous metal. One can find ferrous metal within <b>crates,</b> <b>pallets,</b> construction and demolition debris as nails, screws, staples and other hardware. Larger pieces such as scrap metal can also be found within the wood waste supply. Other sources of metal contaminant include damaged parts from the processing equipment (for example, sections of chain, bolts, and tools). Metal contaminants create problems for processing equipment. For example, chippers are sensitive to even the smallest pieces of metal. Even the sturdiest hog can receive serious damage from a piece of metal. Most importantly, to safeguard against damage to the equipment, detect ferrous metals at the in-feed of certain critical pieces of process equipment, like sizereduction equipment. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends wood waste processors install a metal detection system upstream of sensitive or critical process equipment. Generally, metal detection equipment is installed in a conveyor system. The basic equipment consists of a section of metal free conveyor trough, usually fiberglass, that contains a metal detecting coil. The detector is activated by the presence of magnetic or non-magnetic metal in the material flow. Any metal passing over the coil produces an electronic signal that activates an alarm system. The alarm usually sets off a warnin...|$|R

Methods and Results: Pooled swab samples were obtained from <b>pallets,</b> <b>crates,</b> wheels of trucks, tractors and forklifts, truck beds, and from drivers' and catchers' boots. After enrichment in Bolton's broth Campylobacter were recovered on modified blood-free Campylobacter selective agar (mCCDA). Isolates were identified using tests for phenotypic and biochemical characteristics. Of the 209 samples collected, 53 % were positive for C. jejuni, with all fomites positive except tractor wheels. Pallets had the highest contamination rate at 75 %. More than 50 % of catchers' boots, drivers' boots, crates and truck wheels were positive. Forty-seven per cent and 31 % of truck beds and forklift wheels, respectively, were contaminated. The proportion of contaminated fomites did not change significantly during the day.

40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out aimed at {{identifying}} potential sources of transmission of Campylobacter jejuni to broiler chickens, determining whether boots can mechanically transmit C. jejuni to susceptible chickens, determining the transmission rate of C. jejuni in broiler chickens, and assessing the effect of washing slaughterhouse fomites with chlorinated water {{on the level of}} C. jejuni contamination during the day. Bacteriological culture of samples taken in the premises of a broiler slaughterhouse showed that after washing and just before departure for depopulation of broiler farms, 75 %, 58. 33 %, 47. 22 %, 50 %, 54. 29 %, 66. 67 %, 31. 25 %, and 0 % of <b>pallets,</b> <b>crates,</b> truck beds, truck wheels, drivers' boots, catchers' boots, forklift wheels, and tractor wheels respectively, were contaminated with C. jejuni. Therefore it was concluded that slaughterhouse personnel and fomites could potentially transmit C. jejuni during partial depopulation of broiler flocks. The level of C. jejuni in consecutive sample batches of fomites (n = 30) that were collected in six periods of one hour each day (hence six batches), between 0530 and 1230 hrs, over six days, was found to range from 44. 83 % in the lst batch and 66. 67 % in the 5 th batch, indicating that washing fomites with pressurized chlorinated water makes no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05) in the contamination level. The fomites sampled were <b>pallets,</b> <b>crates,</b> truck bed, truck wheels, and drivers' boots. Susceptible broiler chickens became colonized with C. jejuni after exposure to boots that had been worn in a pen with infected chickens demonstrating that boots can mechanically cause horizontal transmission of the bacterium.

In commercial large-scale monoculture seed production, unlike crop production, it is of vital importance to avoid contaminating the crop with off-type seed of the same species. Therefore, selective herbicides cannot be used. Whereas bromomethane is dangerous, it is considerably safer and more effective than some other soil sterilants. Its loss to the seed industry has resulted in changes to cultural practices, with increased reliance on soil steam sterilization, mechanical rogueing, and fallow seasons. Bromomethane was also used as a general-purpose fumigant to kill a variety of pests including rats and insects. Bromomethane has poor fungicidal properties. Bromomethane is the only fumigant allowed (heat treatment is only other option) under ISPM 15 regulations when exporting solid wood packaging (forklift <b>pallets,</b> <b>crates,</b> bracing) to ISPM 15 compliant countries.

Further, according to the method `ergonomic design, additional wishes of the people who will have will work with the standardised crates have been formulated. Finally is examined how the inventoried requirements and wishes can be fulfilled. For that purpose the questions were answered, based on literature reviews, measurements and expertise. Some of the most important results are that: Physical load is lower during the lifting of 40 x 60 cm crates than during the lifting of 50 x 75 cm crates with the same weight. The physical load during the lifting of low standing crates reduces when the crates (and therefore handles) are as high as possible, but this effect is very small. Since the height of the piles is limited by other factors, no effect of crate altitude on physical load is expected when crates have to be moved from or to a high level. Without the use of special tools the physical load is always too high when piles are higher than 1. 70 m. But even in ideal conditions the lifting of 15 or 20 kg crates to an altitude of 1. 70 m results in a Lifting Index of 1. 1 or 1. 4 respectively, what is higher than the health standard. For handles, a dimension of 125 x 40 mm is recommended. Sharp edges must be avoided and it must be impossible to put sharp objects, such as staples, through the handles. Closed handles prevent that bulbs fall through the handles. Physical load when crates are taken from or placed on a high pile can be reduced al little when these handles are not only at the top of the crates, but also halfway. No large effect of standardisation of the layout of the crates on mechanisation is expected, since nearly all tools do not pick up the crates but grip them. Standardisation of the format (40 x 60 cm) is important, however, and the sides must be exactly rectangular. For transport in conditioned sea containers (inner width 2. 26 or 2. 28 m.) 100 x 120 cm pallets are most suitable. However, physical load during manual piling up of <b>crates</b> on these <b>pallets</b> is higher than when 80 x 100 cm pallets are used. In both cases the health limits are largely exceeded during manual handling of the crates. If crates with different altitudes must become piled up on the same pallet, tuning of the altitude of the different crates is needed. Good examples are 18 and 24 cm or 16. 5 and 22 cm. If it must be possible to read the information on the crates automatically, transponders (chips) are preferred over bar codes. It is recommended to apply a low-frequency system and to give all crates only a unique number. A central database can contain information concerning the contents of all crates. The recommendations in this report answer different questions and some of them can not be combined with some others. For this reason the `ideal crate will be a combination of compromises. Therefore it is recommended - in accordance with the original design of this study to carry out a pilot before choosing definitively for one basic design for the standardized crates. In this pilot all users should be involved, and it is preferred to let them test a number of copies of the aimed types of cask...|$|R
