In 1956, Jif was the sole brand of lemon juice {{packaged}} in a squeeze pack <b>container</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom. The new Jif brand used the packaging developed by Edward Hack.|$|E
5|$|The next day, CIA agent Lacey {{shows up}} at Skylark and Rapaport's place, proposing that the duo assassinate Kim using a transdermal strip that will expose Kim to ricin via handshake; they reluctantly agree. Skylark carries the ricin strip hidden inside a pack of gum. Upon their arrival in the presidential palace in Pyongyang, they are {{introduced}} to security officers Koh and Yu; Koh discovers the strip and chews it, believing it to be gum. That night, Lacey airdrops them two more strips from an UAV, {{but in order to}} smuggle it back to their room, Rapaport has to evade a Siberian tiger and then hide the <b>container</b> <b>in</b> his rectum. Later, Kim shows up and introduces himself to Skylark.|$|E
5|$|At the {{shipping}} yard, Dexter breaks into the <b>container</b> <b>in</b> the picture, {{only to find}} it full of bananas. Doakes appears and asks him what he is doing, and after a fist fight, a foreman arrives and orders them to leave. Doakes tells Dexter that {{he knows that he}} is up to something, and says that he will be watching him. Meanwhile, Rita is contacted by an imprisoned Paul, who contends that Dexter knocked him out and set him up. Rita becomes annoyed as Paul persists that Dexter is dangerous and should not be around their children. Rita is visited by Paul's Narcotics Anonymous sponsor, who attempts to convince Rita that Paul is telling the truth. In a final plea, Paul calls Rita and tells her to search their house for a shoe which he believes came off when Dexter knocked him out. Rita hangs up, but discovers the shoe while taking out the trash {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E

25|$|The {{process begins}} by heating the stock {{material}} (for hot or warm extrusion). It is then {{loaded into the}} <b>container</b> <b>in</b> the press. A dummy block is placed behind it where the ram then presses on the material to push {{it out of the}} die. Afterward the extrusion is stretched in order to straighten it. If better properties are required then it may be heat treated or cold worked.|$|E
25|$|Because ZFS acts as both volume {{manager and}} file system, the {{terminology}} and layout of ZFS storage covers two aspects: how physical devices are organized into vdevs (redundant storage) to create storage for a ZFS pool or zpool (the top level of data <b>container</b> <b>in</b> a ZFS system), {{and how a}} pool is used to contain datasets (file systems) and volumes (block devices), the two kinds of data structures which ZFS is capable of presenting to a user.|$|E
25|$|An All Terrain Armoured Cargo Transport (AT-ACT) {{appears in}} the 2016 film Rogue One. The new walkers are {{slightly}} larger than the standard AT-AT, with a hollowed-out center section that can hold a cargo container. As depicted in the film, {{it appears to be}} easier to destroy AT-ACT vehicles, as their armor {{does not appear to be}} as strong as their AT-AT counterparts. Under sustained fire, their leg joints can be destroyed, causing the vehicle to fall, and they can be broken in half when fired upon without the cargo <b>container</b> <b>in</b> place.|$|E

25|$|Spices, called besamim in Hebrew, often {{stored in}} an artistically {{decorative}} spice <b>container</b> <b>in</b> order to beautify and honor the Mitzvah, are handed around {{so that everyone}} can smell the fragrance. In many Sephardi and Mizrahi communities, branches of aromatic plants are used for this purpose, while Ashkenazim have traditionally used cloves. A special braided Havdalah candle {{with more than one}} wick is lit, and a blessing is recited. If a special havdalah candle is not available, two candles can be used, and the two flames joined when reciting the blessing.|$|E
25|$|If {{one could}} observe a gas under a {{powerful}} microscope, one {{would see a}} collection of particles (molecules, atoms, ions, electrons, etc.) without any definite shape or volume that are in more or less random motion. These neutral gas particles only change direction when they collide with another particle or with {{the sides of the}} <b>container.</b> <b>In</b> an ideal gas, these collisions are perfectly elastic. This particle or microscopic view of a gas is described by the Kinetic-molecular theory. The assumptions behind this theory {{can be found in the}} postulates section of Kinetic Theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{different}} types of urinals, be it for single users or as trough designs for multiple users, are often intended to be utilized from a standing position (rather than squatting or sitting), but designs exist which are intended {{to be used with}} other postures. The term may also apply to a small building or other structure containing such fixtures. It can also refer to a small <b>container</b> <b>in</b> which urine can be collected for medical analysis, or for use where access to toilet facilities is not possible, such as in small aircraft, during extended stakeouts, or for the bedridden.|$|E

25|$|A massive {{ideal gas}} {{with only one}} type of {{particle}} is uniquely described by three state functions such as the temperature, volume, {{and the number of}} particles. However, for a black body, the energy distribution is established by the interaction of the photons with matter, usually the walls of the <b>container.</b> <b>In</b> this interaction, the number of photons is not conserved. As a result, the chemical potential of the black body photon gas is zero. The number of state variables needed to describe a black body state is thus reduced from three to two (e.g. temperature and volume).|$|E
25|$|The sample return mission {{would be}} {{designed}} to break the chain of contact between Mars and {{the exterior of the}} sample container, for instance, by sealing the returned container inside another larger <b>container</b> <b>in</b> the vacuum of space before return to Earth. In order to eliminate the risk of parachute failure, the current plan is to return the capsule to the Earth without the use of parachutes: the capsule will fall at terminal velocity and the impact will be cushioned by the capsule's thermal protection system. The sample container would {{be designed to}} withstand the force of the impact.|$|E
25|$|Electrospinning is a {{very old}} {{technique}} whereby a fluid is held in a <b>container</b> <b>in</b> a manner such that {{it is able to}} flow out through capillary action. A conducting substrate is positioned below, and a large difference in electrical potential is applied between the fluid and the substrate. The fluid is attracted to the substrate, and tiny fibres jump almost instantly from their point of emission, the Taylor cone, to the substrate, drying as they travel. This method has been shown to create nano-scale fibres from both silk dissected from organisms and regenerated silk fibroin.|$|E

25|$|Grissom and {{his team}} found the washed-up rock star dead in his kitchen in the episode Built to Kill, Part 2. His body was sprawled {{in a chair and}} leaning {{forwards}} onto the table. They determined that {{the cause of death was}} a single blow delivered to the back of a head with a rolling pin. The first miniature was found close by. It was a perfect diorama of the kitchen, and even included objects in the garbage and placement of Delancy's blood. In the model they also found a picture of a bloodied doll, hidden behind a mini photo frame, and a bleach <b>container</b> <b>in</b> the miniature garbage.|$|E
25|$|Of greater {{difficulty}} {{was finding}} {{a method to}} boil water. For people without access to natural heated water sources, such as hot springs, heated stones ("pot boilers") could {{be placed in a}} water-filled vessel to raise its temperature (for example, a leaf-lined pit or the stomach from animals killed by hunters). In many locations the shells of turtles or large mollusks provided a source for waterproof cooking vessels. Bamboo tubes sealed at the end with clay provided a usable <b>container</b> <b>in</b> Asia, while the inhabitants of the Tehuacan Valley began carving large stone bowls that were permanently set into a hearth as early as 7,000 BC.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{shipment}} of CONEXes, containing engineering supplies and spare parts, {{was made by}} rail from the Columbus General Depot in Georgia to the Port of San Francisco, then by ship to Yokohama, Japan, and then to Korea, in late 1952; shipment times were almost halved. By {{the time of the}} Vietnam War the majority of supplies and materials were shipped by CONEX. By 1965 the US military used some 100,000 Conex boxes, and more than 200,000 in 1967. making this the first worldwide application of intermodal containers. After the US Department of Defense standardized an 8-foot by 8-foot cross section <b>container</b> <b>in</b> multiples of 10-foot lengths for military use, it was rapidly adopted for shipping purposes.|$|E
