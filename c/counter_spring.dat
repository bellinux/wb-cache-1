The mini Stewart Platform consists of a fixed base and a platform connected with specially designed SMA actuators along with a <b>counter</b> force <b>spring.</b> The support post for the platform uses a <b>counter</b> force <b>spring</b> material viz. sponges. Further study includes the design of a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technique power supply circuit for the controlling the current to increase the temperature of the heat sensitive wires.

40|$|International audienceThe SPRING {{pseudo-random}} function (PRF) {{has been}} described by Banerjee, Brenner, Leurent, Peikert and Rosen at FSE 2014. It is quite fast, only 4. 5 times slower than the AES (without hardware acceleration) when used in <b>counter</b> mode. <b>SPRING</b> is similar to the PRF of Banerjee, Peikert and Rosen from EUROCRYPT 2012, whose security relies on the hardness of the Learning With Rounding (LWR) problem, which can itself be reduced to hard lattice problems. However, there is no such chain of reductions relating SPRING to lattice problems, because it uses small parameters for efficiency reasons. Consequently, the heuristic security of SPRING is evaluated using known attacks and the complexity of the best known algorithms for breaking the underlying hard problem. In this paper, we revisit the efficiency and security of SPRING when used as a pseudo-random generator. We propose a new variant which is competitive with the AES in counter mode without hardware AES acceleration, and about four times slower than AES with hardware acceleration. In terms of security, we improve some previous analysis of SPRING and we estimate the security of our variant against classical algorithms and attacks. Finally, we implement our variant using AVX 2 instructions, resulting in high performances on high-end desktop computers...|$|R

This report presents a concept on a pushing <b>counter</b> lever <b>spring</b> which provides the same characteristics of force curve as a diaphragm spring in a pressure plate of a car has. The mechanism is to be used for long-term testing and evaluating clutch pedals. The work describes the development process and the manufacture of a prototype.

Excel is a great help at the theoretical calculation of the mechanism and to evaluate the theory behind the concept. The result shows how to simulate a diaphragm spring in the pressure plate in a car for long-term testing of clutch pedals.

50|$|Different {{designs of}} {{governors}} {{have been used}} since the mid-19th century to control the speeds of the water turbines. A variety of flyball systems, or first-generation governors, were used during the first 100 years of water turbine speed controls. In early flyball systems, the flyball component <b>countered</b> by a <b>spring</b> acted directly to the valve of the turbine or the wicket gate to control {{the amount of water}} that enters the turbines. Newer systems with mechanical governors started around 1880. An early mechanical governors is a servomechanism that comprises a series of gears that use the turbine's speed to drive the flyball and turbine's power to drive the control mechanism. The mechanical governors were continued to be enhanced in power amplification through the use of gears and the dynamic behavior. By 1930, the mechanical governors had many parameters that could be set on the feedback system for precise controls. In the later part of the twentieth century, electronic governors and digital systems started to replace the mechanical governors. In the electronic governors, also known as second-generation governors, the flyball was replaced by rotational speed sensor but the controls were still done through analog systems. In the modern systems, also known as third-generation governors, the controls are performed digitally by algorithms that are programmed to the computer of the governor.|$|R

40|$|Annual and {{seasonal}} mean circulations in the Azores-Gibraltar Strait Region (North-Eastern Atlantic) are described based on climatological data. An inverse box model {{is applied to}} obtain absolute water mass transports consistent with the conservation of volume, salt and heat and the equations of the thermal wind. The large-scale gyre circulation (Azores Current, Azores Counter Current, Canary Current and Portugal Current) is well-represented in climatological data. The Azores Current annual mean transport {{was estimated to be}} 6. 5 ± 0. 8 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m 3 /s) eastward, exhibiting a seasonal signal with minimum transport in the spring (5. 3 ± 0. 8 Sv) and maximum transport in autumn (7. 3 ± 0. 8 Sv). The Azores Current transport is twice that of the Azores <b>Counter</b> Current in <b>spring</b> and autumn and is four-times higher in summer and winter. The southward Portugal and Canary Currents show similar seasonal cycles with maximum transports in spring (3. 5 ± 0. 6 and 6. 6 ± 0. 4 Sv, respectively). The overturning circulation within the area has an annual mean magnitude of 2. 2 ± 0. 1 Sv and two seasonal extremes; the highest in summer (2. 6 ± 0. 1 Sv) and the lowest in winter (1. 7 ± 0. 1 Sv). Of the annual mean, about two thirds (1. 4 Sv) of the overturning circulation results from water mass transformation west of the Strait of Gibraltar: the downwelling and recirculation of upper Central Water (0. 6 Sv) in the intermediate layer, the entrainment of Central Water (0. 6 Sv) into the Mediterranean Outflow and the contribution of Antarctic Intermediate Water (0. 2 Sv) to the Mediterranean Outflow. The remaining 0. 8 Sv relates to the overturning in the Mediterranean Sea through the two-layer exchange at the Gibraltar Strait. Accordingly, the density level dividing the upper-inflowing and lower-outflowing limbs of the overturning circulation was found to be σ 1 = 31. 65 kg m- 3 (σ 1, potential density referred to 1000 db), which is above the isopycnal that typically separates Central and Mediterranean Water (σ 1 = 31. 8 kg m- 3). In terms of water masses, we describe quantitatively the water mass composition of the main currents. Focusing on the spread of Mediterranean Water, we found that when the northward Mediterranean Water branch weakens in spring and autumn, the westward Mediterranean Water vein strengthens, and vice versa. The maximum net transports of Mediterranean Water across the northern and western sections of the box were estimated at - 1. 9 ± 0. 6 Sv (summer) and - 0. 8 ± 0. 2 Sv (spring), respectively.
