5000|$|The Navistar DT {{diesel engines}} {{are of a}} wet-sleeve design. This means that the <b>cylinder</b> wall (<b>sleeve)</b> is a {{separately}} machined part that fits into the cylinder bores cast into the engine block. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> is {{in contact with the}} engine coolant, hence the [...] "wet"-sleeve.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{analysis}} of temperature distribution in the wet <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> in the initial phase {{of the work of}} turbocharged engine in nonstationary state were determined. The computations were performed by means of the two-zone combustion model, the boundary conditions of III kind and the finite elements method (FEM) by using of COSMOS/M program. The characteristic surfaces of the cylinder were analyzed. The results of numeric calculations displayed the possibility of the use of the original two-zone combustion model and finite elements method to analysis of values and temporary temperature distribution on individual surfaces in the wet <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve...</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike the SV engine, {{which uses}} cast iron <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves,</b> the DL650 uses Suzuki's {{proprietary}} SCEM (Suzuki Composite Electro-chemical Material) plated cylinders, a race-proven nickel-phosphorus-silicon-carbide coating for reduced weight and improved heat transfer, allowing for tighter {{and more efficient}} piston-to-cylinder clearance, similar to a Nikasil coating.|$|E

5000|$|A {{cylinder}} block is a unit comprising several cylinders (including their cylinder walls, coolant passages, <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves</b> if any, and so forth). In the earliest decades of {{internal combustion engine}} development, monobloc cylinder construction was rare; cylinders were usually cast individually. Combining their castings into pairs or triples was an early win of monobloc design.|$|E

An economical <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> and piston change {{was all that was}} needed. This brought the power level up to that of the 450 model.|$|R
50|$|The {{contacts}} in the plug are simple <b>cylinders</b> (<b>sleeves),</b> while the pin {{contacts in}} the receptacle have the spring arrangement to hold contact pressure, the reverse of the IEC 60309 type connectors. All contacts are the same diameter. Originally metal construction was used, {{but now they are}} also made with plastic shells. Since only keying in the connector shell is used, and since the keys can be damaged in industrial use, it is possible to mis-match worn connectors.|$|R

It could also be fitted with high-compression cylinder heads from the Morgan Plus 8. Using the 5 liter Rover block and crankshaft, a maximum displacement of [...] is theoretically possible.|$|E
50|$|For the {{cylinder}} liners the N52 Engine uses Alusil {{to coat the}} aluminum <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves.</b> Alusil is an aluminium alloy commonly used to make linerless aluminium alloy engine blocks. Alusil, when etched, will expose a very hard silicon precipitate. BMW switched from Nikasil-coated cylinder walls to Alusil in 1996 to eliminate the corrosion problems caused {{through the use of}} petrol or gasoline containing sulphur.|$|E
5000|$|The {{problem was}} {{diagnosed}} to {{originate in the}} thermal expansion rate of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> causing the Cooper Ring in between the block and the head to leak. With this problem solved in the Mk.II 186 bhp version, having a larger 1.35" [...] intake valves (1.30" [...] previously), FWMV started to score GP victories, ending the 1962 season with 3 wins for Lotus, 1 win for Cooper, 5 second places and 4 third places, in addition to 7 pole positions and 6 fastest laps.|$|R
50|$|The most {{powerful}} {{version of the}} Centaurus was intended for the Blackburn Beverley transport aircraft. Using direct fuel injection, it achieved a remarkable 3,220 hp but was never fitted. A projected enlarged capacity version of the Centaurus was designed by Sir Roy Fedden; cylinders were produced for this engine {{but it was never}} built. Known as the Bristol Orion (a name used previously for a variant of the Jupiter engine, and later re-used for a turboprop) this development was also a two-row, 18 <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> valve engine, with the displacement increased to 4,142 cubic inches (67.9 l) (6.25x7.5), nearly as large as the American Wasp Major four-row, 28-cylinder radial, the largest displacement aviation radial engine ever placed in quantity production.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{finite element}} {{analytical}} {{model of a}} diesel engine is established to analyze the stress, the flatness, the roundness {{and the rate of}} light leakage of the diesel engine block. The analysis result shows that the optimized scheme improves the body's stress concentration and deformation obviously: the tensile stress between the upper <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> shoulders spigot and the counter bore of cylinder head bolt decreases by 15 % compares to the original diesel engine block. The maximum stress decreases obviously and the stress concentration region moves down slightly by changing the “T ” type stiffener above the head of the block into rectangular stiffener; the flatness of the end surface of cylinder liner spigot decreases by 11. 3 %; the circularity and the rate of light leakage of each cross section on cylinder liner decreases obviously...|$|R
5000|$|Moreover, in the mid-1980s, hot rodders {{discovered}} the 215 could be stretched {{to as much}} as 305 cid L, using the Buick 300 crankshaft, new <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves,</b> and an assortment of non-Buick parts. It could also be fitted with high-compression cylinder heads from the Morgan +8. Using the 5-litre Rover block and crankshaft, a maximum displacement of [...] is possible and used primarily in racing applications.|$|E
50|$|The FPF was {{a double}} {{overhead}} cam all aluminium four cylinder that was essentially {{half of the}} above FPE V8 engine, which {{was designed as a}} pure racing engine from the outset. Designed in 1955 and becoming available in 1956, it had gear-driven camshafts, steel alloy <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves</b> and individual oil scavenge as well as pressure feed pumps for a dry sump system. Carburetion was by two twin-choke Weber DCO side-draft carburettors.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1980s, as stock engine sizes diminished, rodders {{discovered}} the all-aluminum 215 (Buick or Olds) could be stretched {{to as much}} as 305 cid L, using: the Buick 300 crank, new <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves,</b> and an assortment of non-GM parts, including VW & Mopar lifters and Carter carb. It could also be fitted with high-compression cylinder heads from the Morgan +8. Using the 5-liter Rover block and crank, a maximum displacement of [...] is theoretically possible.|$|E
50|$|The B21A1 was {{basically}} a re-worked B20A5 {{with an increase in}} bore to 83 mm. The external block dimensions had to stay identical (although there was increased external strengthening and webbing on the B21) to the B20A5 block so Honda called upon Saffil to create a thin but strong cylinder liner called FRM (fiber reinforced metal) which basically consisted of a carbon fiber matrix, aluminum alloy, and aluminum oxide to make a very strong <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The sleeve is so strong, in fact, that it wears out the piston rings causing low compression numbers, severe smoking, and high oil usage. It is possible in many situations to merely replace the worn rings in order to revive the motor's former output. Many machine shops will not attempt to re-hone or re-bore the FRM sleeves, as this type of sleeve will de-laminate during machining operations.|$|R
25|$|Open-die {{forgings}} can {{be worked}} into shapes which include discs, hubs, blocks, shafts (including step shafts or with flanges), <b>sleeves,</b> <b>cylinders,</b> flats, hexes, rounds, plate, and some custom shapes.|$|R
30|$|We {{utilized}} the static-pressure support principle to design an asymmetric static-pressure structure for heavy-duty horizontal servo <b>cylinder</b> guide <b>sleeves.</b> The proposed structure {{is equipped with}} a control system. Based on cooperation between the supporting oil pad, counter oil pad, and damper, the radial component of a dynamic partial load can be balanced to perform real-time centering of the piston rod.|$|R
5000|$|A one-off 4 valve Mk.6 had 1.04" [...] {{intake and}} 0.935" [...] exhaust valves, new pistons, <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves</b> and crankshaft, and had gear driven {{camshafts}} {{as opposed to}} the previous chain drive. This engine made [...] at 10300rpm and went to Lotus during 1965. Another 4 valve one-off, Mk.7, was built with 1.107" [...] intake and 1.043" [...] exhaust and all the new Mk.6 parts for [...] at 10500rpm, and was delivered to Brabham. However, these engines started showing reliability problems.|$|E
5000|$|Version one {{was based}} on Ford's 2.3-liter Pinto engine and weighed 152 lb (vs. 415 lb for its cast iron counterpart). It was {{designed}} to produce [...] at 9200 rpm. It was composed of metal <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves,</b> metal combustion chamber tops, metal piston crowns, bearings, valves and seats, and a stock 2.3L Pinto crankshaft. Nearly {{everything else in the}} engine, including the block, rods and piston skirts, were made of glass reinforced Polyamide-imide thermoplastic resins manufactured at the time by Amoco Chemicals Co. The engine was never installed in a vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Engine blocks are {{normally}} cast from either a suitable grade of iron or an aluminium alloy. The aluminium block is much lighter in weight, and has better heat {{transfer to the}} coolant, but iron blocks retain some advantages {{and continue to be}} used by some manufacturers. Because of the use of cylinder liners and bearing shells, the relative softness of aluminium is of no consequence. Some engines have resorted to Plasma transferred wire arc thermal spraying to replace <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves</b> and reduce weight. They can also be produced in compacted graphite iron (CGI) such as some diesel engines from Navistar International.|$|E
5000|$|The Falcon-Knight was {{intended}} to fit in price between the Willys Whippet and larger Willys Knight ranges and was priced $1250, $100 less than the Willys Knight 70A Roadster. It was powered by a six <b>cylinder</b> Knight <b>sleeve</b> valve engine. Except for the engine, much of the car is actually {{the same as the}} Model 93A Whippet with many parts being interchangeable.|$|R
5000|$|All the old {{designs were}} dropped {{and a new}} 10 hp car called the Bullet was {{designed}} by A,W. Reeves who had been at Crossley Motors. This radical design had an air cooled, five <b>cylinder,</b> <b>sleeve</b> valve, radial engine of 1247 cc mounted {{at the front of}} a tubular steel lattice frame. [...] The drive to the rear wheels was via an inclined shaft to a central 3 speed gearbox and then another shaft to the rear axle. Suspension was by transverse cantilever springs. A three-seat body was fitted. When announced a price of £295 was advertised {{but by the time the}} car was exhibited later in the year at the London Motor Show this had risen to £350. A. C. [...] "Gus" [...] Bertelli of the Grahame-White Aviation company was called in to give an opinion on the car and reported that a lot of development was required and the price was uneconomic and should be raised to £550. This was too much for the market and probably only 5 reached customers.|$|R
50|$|Many {{vehicles}} {{were described as}} being fault-prone due to lubrication of the <b>cylinder</b> and <b>sleeve</b> contact faces. Often, proper lubrication could not be guaranteed with the lubricants available at the time, especially with inadequate maintenance. This problem increased with engine speeds over 1600 rpm, {{at which point the}} sleeve-valve engine ceased to provide superior output. With a maximum attainable engine speed of about 1750 rpm, the long-term development potential for the engine was limited.|$|R
50|$|Other {{applications}} {{ranged from}} the Supersport YZF-R6 and YZF-R1 models using electronic fuel injection with YCCT and YCCI to the less extreme but still powerful Yamaha FZ6 (4 valve per cylinder) and FZ1 Fazer line which had a simpler fuel injection designs but was essentially the same basic engine design. The most significant changes made were the 4-valve per cylinder configuration and the crossplane crankshaft found on the YZF-R1 2009, along with the change of <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves</b> to steel for high precision and high temperature durability. Throughout its long period of production, the Genesis range has successfully provided performance and reliability.|$|E
50|$|Navistar {{claims that}} the wet-sleeve design enhances {{durability}} because the consistent wall thickness of the sleeve allows for consistent heat transfer, ensuring the cylinders stay round during thermal expansion. Additionally, they state that the hardened cylinder sleeve is more durable and wear resistant than a softer, cast-in wall. Also, the replaceable <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves</b> protect the block from damage (e.g. in case of foreign objects entering the cylinder) and can easily be replaced, which Navistar claims enables simpler restoration to original specifications. The wet-sleeve design also allows the engine to be rebuilt easily to factory specifications, sometimes without even removing the engine from the vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|HT {{stood for}} High Technology. For its time, {{the engine and}} its {{electronic}} control module (ECM) were quite sophisticated, despite having a throttle-body fuel injection system (as opposed to more advanced multiport fuel injection). Like the 6.0/368" [...] DFI engines before it, the HT4100 used an ECM that incorporated a detailed on-board computer. Every parameter of engine performance could be displayed on the Electronic Climate Control panel while the car was being driven. The HT4100 also adopted other modern design features including replaceable <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeves,</b> high operating temperature for emission control (210 degrees, compared to 180 in earlier engines), free circulation of coolant between the block and the heads, and bimetal construction that mounted heat-tolerant cast-iron heads onto a weight-saving aluminum block. The engine had a bore of 3.465 in and stroke of 3.307 in, for a total displacement of 4.1 L. It produced [...] at 4400 rpm and 190 lbfft Nm of torque at 2000 rpm.|$|E
50|$|Typical parts made by {{this process}} are pipes, flywheels, {{cylinder}} liners {{and other parts}} that are axi-symmetric. It is notably used to cast <b>cylinder</b> liners and <b>sleeve</b> valves for piston engines, parts {{which could not be}} reliably manufactured otherwise.|$|R
2500|$|Upon introduction, {{the model}} {{had only one}} trim level, which would later {{be known as the}} LX model trim; it was powered by the 2.0L straight-four B20B {{producing}} [...] at 5400rpm and [...] of torque at 4800rpm. Outer dimensions for this engine would be identical to the Integra's 1.8L engine, but internally the engine had a larger [...] bore to add the extra displacement needed to produce more torque. The engine utilized a one-piece <b>cylinder</b> <b>sleeve</b> construction unique from any other B-series engine. The chassis was a unibody design with a four-wheel double wishbone suspension. Inside, the rear seats were able to fold down, and a picnic table was stowed in the rear floor area. A common external trait that was visible with this generation was plastic cladding covering the front bumper, rear bumper, and fender wells. In most countries, CR-Vs had a chrome grille; however, in the United States, the grille was made out of the same black plastic as the bumpers. A major difference between the LX and EX trims was that the EX had anti-lock brakes and 15inch alloy wheels while the LX did not. Drivetrain options were front-wheel drive or Honda's Real Time AWD.|$|R
50|$|A vacuum {{variable}} capacitor uses {{a set of}} plates made from concentric cylinders that can be slid {{in or out of}} an opposing set of <b>cylinders</b> (<b>sleeve</b> and plunger). These plates are then sealed inside of a non-conductive envelope such as glass or ceramic and placed under a high vacuum. The movable part (plunger) is mounted on a flexible metal membrane that seals and maintains the vacuum. A screw shaft is attached to the plunger, when the shaft is turned the plunger moves in or out of the sleeve and the value of the capacitor changes. The vacuum not only increases the working voltage and current handling capacity of the capacitor it also greatly reduces the chance of arcing across the plates. The most common usage for vacuum variables are in high powered transmitters such as those used for broadcasting, military and amateur radio as well as high powered RF tuning networks. Vacuum variables can also be more convenient since the elements are under a vacuum the working voltage can be higher than an air variable the same size, allowing the size of the vacuum capacitor to be reduced.|$|R
