Dislocation occurs when the ball - <b>shaped</b> <b>head</b> of the femur {{comes out of the}} <b>cup</b> - <b>shaped</b> {{acetabulum}} set in the pelvis. This may happen to a varying degree. A dislocated hip, much more common in females than in males, is a condition that can either be congenital or acquired. Understanding the epidemiology, anatomy, difference between congenital and acquired, screening, treatments, and rehabilitation are all relevant to the topic.|$|R

40|$|Microneedle {{technology}} {{is one of}} the attractive methods in transdermal drug delivery. However, the clinical applications of this method are limited owing to: complexity in the preparation of multiple coating solutions, drug leakage while inserting the microneedles into the skin and the outer walls of the solid microneedle can hold limited quantity of drug. Here, the authors present the fabrication of an array of rectangular <b>cup</b> <b>shaped</b> silicon microneedles, which provide for reduced drug leakage resulting in improvement of efficiency of drug delivery and possibility of introducing multiple drugs. The fabricated solid microneedles with rectangular <b>cup</b> <b>shaped</b> tip have a total height of 200 mu m. These <b>cup</b> <b>shaped</b> tips have dimensions: 60 x 60 mu m (length x breadth) with a depth of 60 mu m. The cups are filled with drug using a novel in-house built drop coating system. Successful drug dissolution was observed when the coated microneedle was used on mice. Also, using the above method, it is possible to fill the cups selectively with different drugs, which enables simultaneous multiple drug delivery. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society...|$|R
5000|$|In the Hebrew Bible, the almond was {{a symbol}} of watchfulness and promise due to its early flowering. In the Bible the almond is {{mentioned}} ten times, beginning with Book of Genesis 43:11, where it is described as [...] "among the best of fruits". In Numbers 17 Levi is chosen from the other tribes of Israel by Aaron's rod, which brought forth almond flowers. According to tradition, the rod of Aaron bore sweet almonds on one side and bitter on the other; if the Israelites followed the Lord, the sweet almonds would be ripe and edible, but if they were to forsake the path of the Lord, the bitter almonds would predominate. The almond blossom supplied a model for the menorah which stood in the Holy Temple, [...] "Three <b>cups,</b> <b>shaped</b> like almond blossoms, were on one branch, with a knob and a flower; and three <b>cups,</b> <b>shaped</b> like almond blossoms, were on the other...on the candlestick itself were four <b>cups,</b> <b>shaped</b> like almond blossoms, with its knobs and flowers" [...] (Exodus 25:33-34; 37:19-20).|$|R

40|$|This {{project is}} about the {{development}} and analysis of arrow for archery. 3 types of arrow head been designed: bullet <b>shaped</b> <b>head,</b> 3 D <b>shaped</b> <b>head</b> and cone <b>shaped</b> <b>head.</b> The arrow performance measurement parameters were studied such as the FOC values, static stiffness values and the drag forces. SolidWorks 2012 was used to designs {{the three types of}} arrow head and the drag force is simulated by using SolidWork Flow Simulation. The material used for the arrow head fabrication is stainless steel 304. The arrow shafts used are carbon shaft of 5. 46 mm outer diameter and 7 mm fiberglass and carbon fiber shaft. 3 different shaft properties are used to determine the effect of static stiffness, arrow heads weight and shaft diameter on the drag force generated at the arrow. The experimented result for Beman 570 - 14 arrows are slightly higher compared to simulation results obtained from SolidWorks. The possible cause is the characteristic of the arrow during flight where arrows starts to bend in C manner then straight again then bend again in reverse C manner and so on when it been shot. These deformation causes energy losses to the surrounding due to air friction, natural damping effect and shear friction. From the result obtained, it is shown that fiberglass shaft arrow has the highest drag force regardless of the arrow head types used compared to the other two types of shaft. Although Beman 570 - 14 shaft has smaller frontal area compared to a 7 mm outer diameter carbon fiber shaft, the drag force obtained from the experiment shows that both bullet <b>shaped</b> <b>head</b> and 3 D <b>shaped</b> <b>head</b> for carbon fiber shaft has lower drag force compared with the same arrow <b>head</b> <b>shape...</b>|$|R
