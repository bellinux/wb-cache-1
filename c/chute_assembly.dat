5000|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{evacuation slide}} {{was developed and}} produced by Air Cruisers, founded by James F. Boyle, inventor of the World War II life vest, the [...] "Mae West". [...] The patent for the inflatable escape <b>chute</b> <b>assembly</b> was submitted by Boyle in 1954 and the designs was patented in 1956 under patent number 2,765,131. Today Air Cruisers provides slides for over 65% of the aircraft slide market. Prior to inflatables, some passenger aircraft utilized canvas type slides which required the crew to undertake an extensive rigging procedure. Canvas type slides are still found on some Russian aircraft.|$|E

Researchers at the Spokane Research Laboratory of the Na 2 Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) are investigating methods to improve safety during the transport of ore in ore passes. Design criteria and hang-up prevention and remedia 2 strategies involve studies {{of the effects of}} static and dynamic ore and waste-rock loads on chutes, walls, gates and support structures. Particle flow analysis methods were used to simulate the response of various ore pass designs {{to a wide range of}} ore loading condi 2. A full-scale mockup of ac 2 ore pass and <b>chute</b> <b>assemblies</b> was duplicated and tested for load response.

40|$|The present work aims {{to design}} and {{analysis}} of Ball mill inlet chute along with the truck assembly for Roller press circuit UMS (Unidan Mill S) type FLS Ball mill which {{are used in the}} Cement industry for grinding clinker material. The present mill inlet chute can be used for the two compartment ball mills only in which primary and finish grinding both are takes place. It may be a closed or open circuit grinding systems. In recent days, the Ball mill grinding systems are used with the Roller press and it is developing very fastly. The primary grinding is done by the Roller press and finish grinding takes place in Ball mill. Because of this, we can increase the Ball mill capacity as well as the Cement production. Also the feed materials which are coming from roller press to the ball mill are powdery form instead of Clinker material. The feed chute for this application requires more area to direct the material and more air allowing area to achieve the required air flow inside the mill to transmit the grounded material. The replacement of the liner plates/mill components and access during maintenance is difficult in the present UMS mills since the mill inlet is fixed with the foundation. This can be avoided by implementing the new designed movable truck <b>assembly</b> at inlet <b>chute.</b> In this design, the Inlet chute will be fixed on the movable truck assembly which can be easily removable along with chute during the maintenance and liner plate replacement. The main objective of this project is to identify and design the suitable inlet chute for the BM+RP mill circuit with feed <b>chute</b> truck <b>assembly.</b> The designed <b>chute's</b> flow characteristics will be analyzed b...|$|R
