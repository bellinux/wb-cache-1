5000|$|The ŽNR {{worked to}} educate women about their rights, {{as well as}} to mold public opinion. To that end, they worked to {{establish}} a library of materials about women both from within Czechoslovakia and abroad. The organization collected women's literature, and specifically tried to obtain information on reforms, draft laws, and pending legislation which might impact women's equality. Members were encouraged to contact legislative members, trade unions and libraries in other jurisdictions to expand the information ŽNR could offer for study to members, public officials and journalists. They also established a journal, Ženská rada (Women's advice) which was published from 1925 to 1938 and edited by Plamínková. Developing a number of departments, the organization focused on women's civil status as wives and employees, educational opportunities, family matters and parenting, legal status, morality, pacifism, personal freedom, and societal improvement. Members like Milada Horáková, Marie Svozilová and Hana Vichová devoted speeches and articles to criticize the government's failure to implement laws for equality which was constitutionally guaranteed. They demanded an end to employment {{discrimination on the basis of}} sex and insisted that equal pay for employment based on education and skill be upheld. Because the civil <b>code</b> <b>designated</b> the man as head of the household, women by law were legal dependents having the same position as children, with decision-making authority over their economic life or guardianship concerns for their children. ŽNR drafted a new civil code which called for equality of spouses as well as for their mutual care of dependents and each other. Each spouse should have the right to work and the responsibility for care of the family with equal decision-making authority, and for domestic maintenance. There should be equality in division of assets, the right of spouses to choose their legal name, the right of divorce and equal alimony regardless to the sex of the lower earning partner. Their suggestions were rejected and though the law was revised in 1931, men still maintained authority over children, property and their wives; the only substantive change being that marriage would henceforward be a civil partnership, rather than a religious rite.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{changes in}} shapes of fiber-reinforced {{composite}} beams, plates and shells affected by embedded piezoelectric actuators were investigated. An analytical method was developed {{which can be}} used to calculate the changes in shapes for specified applied voltages to the actuators. The method is formulated on the basis of mathematical models using two-dimensional, linear, shallow shell theory including transverse shear ef-fects which are important in the case of sandwich construction. Solutions to the governing equations were obtained via the Ritz method. A computationally efficient computer code with a user-friendly interface was written which is suitable for performing the numerical calculations. The <b>code,</b> <b>designated</b> as SHAPE 1, provides the change in shape for specified applied voltages. To validate the method and the computer code, results generated by the code were compared to existing analytical and experimental results and to test data ob-tained {{during the course of the}} present investigation. The predictions provided by the SHAPE 1 code were in excellent agreement with the results of the other analyses and data. 1...|$|E
