25|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} theory is that high transmural pressures lead to pulmonary capillary stress failure. There may be contributions from the bronchial circulation. Pulmonary capillary transmural pressure is determined by pulmonary <b>capillary</b> <b>pressure</b> and airway pressure. The horse has very high pulmonary vascular pressures during intense exercise, exceeding 100 mmHg in the pulmonary artery during intense exercise. During expiration the high positive pressures in the pulmonary blood vessels pushing out are opposed by high positive airway pressures pushing back and this does not place undue stress on the thin blood vessel walls. During inspiration, the high positive pressures in the pulmonary blood vessels pushing out are met by negative pressures distending the blood vessel and placing increased stress on the walls.|$|E
25|$|The {{available}} {{space for}} air and moisture in wood {{depends on the}} density and porosity of wood. Porosity is the volume fraction of void space in a solid. The porosity {{is reported to be}} 1.2 to 4.6% of dry volume of wood cell wall (Siau, 1984). On the other hand, permeability {{is a measure of the}} ease with which fluids are transported through a porous solid under the influence of some driving forces, e.g. <b>capillary</b> <b>pressure</b> gradient or moisture gradient. It is clear that solids must be porous to be permeable, but it does not necessarily follow that all porous bodies are permeable. Permeability can only exist if the void spaces are interconnected by openings. For example, a hardwood may be permeable because there is intervessel pitting with openings in the membranes (Keey et al., 2000). If these membranes are occluded or encrusted, or if the pits are aspirated, the wood assumes a closed-cell structure and may be virtually impermeable. The density is also important for impermeable hardwoods because more cell-wall material is traversed per unit distance, which offers increased resistance to diffusion (Keey et al., 2000). Hence lighter woods, in general, dry more rapidly than do the heavier woods. The transport of fluids is often bulk flow (momentum transfer) for permeable softwoods at high temperature while diffusion occurs for impermeable hardwoods (Siau, 1984). These mechanisms are discussed below.|$|E

50|$|<b>Capillary</b> <b>pressure</b> plays a {{vital role}} in extracting sub-surface {{hydrocarbons}} (such as petroleum or natural gas) from underneath porous reservoir rocks.

Additionally, <b>capillary</b> <b>pressure</b> in porous rocks has been shown to affect phase behavior of the reservoir fluids, thus influencing extraction methods and recovery. It is crucial to understand these geological properties of the reservoir for its development, production, and management (e.g. how easy it is to extract the hydrocarbons).The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is an example of why <b>capillary</b> <b>pressure</b> is significant to the petrochemical industry.

40|$|AbstractThere is {{disagreement}} {{concerning the}} use of the pulmonary <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> (in place of left atrial pressure) in assessing the presence and severity of mitral valve disease. This study was done to assess the accuracy and reliability of an oximetrically confirmed pulmonary <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> in measuring the transvalvular pressure gradient and valve area in patients with mitral stenosis. In 10 patients with mitral stenosis (1 man and 9 women; mean age ± SD 47 ± 7 years), pulmonary <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> was measured through an 8 F Goodale-Lubin catheter with its wedge position confirmed by oximetry (oxygen saturation ≥ 95 %). In addition, a transseptal left atrial pressure was measured through a Brockenbrough catheter and left ventricular pressure was measured through a pigtail catheter. The mean and phasic left atrial and pulmonary <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressures</b> were similar (mean left atrial pressure 18 ± 6 mm Hg; mean pulmonary <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> 18 ± 8 mm Hg; p = NS). When the pulmonary <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> was used without adjustment for time delay, the transvalvular pressure gradient (9. 8 ± 3. 3 mm Hg) and valve area (1. 5 ± 0. 5 cm 2) were significantly different (p < 0. 05) from the values obtained with use of left atrial pressure (7. 2 ± 2. 9 mm Hg and 1. 7 ± 0. 6 cm 2, respectively). In contrast, when the pulmonary <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> was adjusted for the time delay through the pulmonary vasculature, the difference in gradients averaged only 1. 7 mm Hg and the mitral valve areas were similar. Thus, in patients with mitral stenosis, a properly obtained, confirmed and time-adjusted pulmonary <b>capillary</b> wedge <b>pressure</b> accurately reflects left atrial pressure. As a result, transseptal left heart catheterization (to measure left atrial pressure) is not necessary in these patients...|$|R
