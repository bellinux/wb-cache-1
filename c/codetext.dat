5000|$|Historically, {{cryptography}} {{was split}} into a dichotomy of codes and ciphers; and coding {{had its own}} terminology, analogous to that for ciphers: [...] "encoding, <b>codetext,</b> decoding" [...] and so on.|$|E
5000|$|Plaintext {{is used as}} {{input to}} an {{encryption}} algorithm; the output is usually termed ciphertext, particularly when the algorithm is a cipher. <b>Codetext</b> is less often used, and almost always only when the algorithm involved is actually a code. Some systems use multiple layers of encryption, with the output of one encryption algorithm becoming [...] "plaintext" [...] input for the next.|$|E
50|$|A {{forensics}} {{examination of}} all letters concerned {{confirmed that the}} signatures were forgeries, based on copies of the original signatures. The examination also indicated that while different typewriters were used to compose the letters, the typing characteristics indicated that the letters were composed by a single individual. The conclusion reached by the examiners was that the letters contained <b>codetext</b> conveying information on the US Navy's ships and their location, condition, repair and status, with emphasis on ships damaged at Pearl Harbor.|$|E

5000|$|Further {{progress}} can be {{made against}} a code by collecting many <b>codetexts</b> encrypted with the same code and then using information from other sources ...|$|R
50|$|In cryptography, {{ciphertext}} or cyphertext is {{the result}} of encryption performed on plaintext using an algorithm, called a cipher. Ciphertext is also known as encrypted or encoded information because it contains a form of the original plaintext that is unreadable by a human or computer without the proper cipher to decrypt it. Decryption, the inverse of encryption, is the process of turning ciphertext into readable plaintext. Ciphertext is {{not to be confused with}} <b>codetext</b> because the latter is a result of a code, not a cipher.|$|E
5000|$|Codes {{are defined}} by [...] "codebooks" [...] (physical or notional), which are {{dictionaries}} of codegroups listed with their corresponding plaintext. Codes originally had the codegroups assigned in 'plaintext order' for convenience of the code designed, or the encoder. For example, in a code using numeric code groups, a plaintext word starting with [...] "a" [...] would have a low-value group, while one starting with [...] "z" [...] would have a high-value group. The same codebook {{could be used to}} [...] "encode" [...] a plaintext message into a coded message or [...] "codetext", and [...] "decode" [...] a <b>codetext</b> back into plaintext message.|$|E
40|$|Most {{encryption}} schemes {{always use}} the same decryption key to convert a particular <b>codetext</b> into plaintext. If a decryption key that has been revealed to multiple parties is compromised, {{it is impossible to}} determine who is responsible for the breach. Heraclitean encryption, which uses public-key encryption (for instance, RSA or elliptic curve) as its cryptographic basis, permits the encryptor to create as many independent decryption keys as desired. Each decryption key can publicly encode information about the party to whom it was issued, so that given a key, anyone can determine its owner. Since decryption keys can be traced, their holders have an incentive to keep them secret. We discuss applications of Heraclitean encryption, provide an example implementation, discuss weaknesses in that implementation, and explore some practicalities of using the scheme. We do not address the issue of tracking decrypted information back to the decryptor; the plaintext is identical fo [...] ...|$|E
