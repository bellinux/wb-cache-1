500|$|As {{shown on}} the right, enzymes with a {{ping-pong}} mechanism can exist in two states, E and a chemically modified form of the enzyme E*; this modified enzyme is known as an intermediate. In such mechanisms, substrate A binds, changes the enzyme to E* by, for example, transferring a <b>chemical</b> <b>group</b> to the active site, and is then released. Only after the first substrate is released can substrate B bind and react with the modified enzyme, regenerating the unmodified E form. When a set of v by [...] curves (fixed A, varying B) from an enzyme with a ping–pong mechanism are plotted in a Lineweaver–Burk plot, a set of parallel lines will be produced.

2500|$|As a result, {{the energy}} gap is reduced, and the {{frequency}} required to achieve resonance is also reduced. This shift in the NMR frequency due to the electronic molecular orbital coupling to the external magnetic field is called chemical shift, and it explains why NMR is able to probe the chemical structure of molecules, which depends on the electron density distribution in the corresponding molecular orbitals. If a nucleus in a specific <b>chemical</b> <b>group</b> is shielded to a higher degree by a higher electron density of its surrounding molecular orbital, then its NMR frequency will be shifted [...] "upfield" [...] (that is, a lower chemical shift), whereas if it is less shielded by such surrounding electron density, then its NMR frequency will be shifted [...] "downfield" [...] (that is, a higher chemical shift).|$|E

40|$|Physiological {{concentrations}} of metabolites can partly {{be explained by}} their molecular struc-ture. We hypothesize that substances containing certain <b>chemical</b> <b>groups</b> show increased or decreased concentration in cells. We consider here, as <b>chemical</b> <b>groups,</b> local atomic configurations, describing an atom, its bonds, and its direct neighbor atoms. To test our hypothesis, we fitted a linear statistical model that relates experimentally determined loga-rithmic concentrations to feature vectors containing count numbers of the <b>chemical</b> <b>groups.</b> In order to determine <b>chemical</b> <b>groups</b> that have a clear effect on the concentration, we use a regularized (lasso) regression. In a dataset on 41 substances of central metabolism in dif-ferent organisms, {{we found that the}} physical concentrations are increased by the occurrence of amino and hydroxyl groups, while aldehydes, ketones, and phosphates show decreased concentrations. The model explains about 22 % of the variance of the logarithmic mean concentrations. Key words: metabolite concentration, QSPR, molecule structure, lasso regression. 1...|$|R
60|$|Section 28. The {{pancreatic}} juice, the secretion of {{the pancreas}} is remarkable as acting {{on all the}} food stuffs that have not already become soluble. It emulsifies fats, that is, it breaks, the drops up into extremely small globules, forming a milky fluid, and it furthermore has a fermentive action upon them; it splits them up into fatty acids, and the soluble body glycerine. The fatty acids combine with alkaline substances (Section 26) to form bodies which belong to the <b>chemical</b> <b>group</b> of Soaps, and which are soluble also. The pancreatic juice also attacks any proteids that have escaped the gastric juice, and converts them into peptones, and any residual starch into sugar. Hence by this stage, in the duodenum, all the food constituents noticed in Section 17 are changed into soluble forms. There are probably, three distinct ferments in the pancreatic juice acting respectively on starch, fat, and proteid, {{but they have not}} been isolated, and the term pancreatin is sometimes used to suggest the three together.|$|E

We have followed the exohedral mode in which the <b>chemical</b> <b>groups</b> {{are attached to the}} outer wall of the CNTs. Exohedral functionalization can be further subdivided into the covalent and non-covalent approaches. In the covalent approach, functionalization has been achieved by attaching the functional group on the side walls, end caps, or defect sites of nanotubes with a covalent bond, whereas in the non-covalent approach, <b>chemical</b> <b>groups</b> are attached by the wrapping of polymers, biomolecules, etc. on nanotubes.|$|R
