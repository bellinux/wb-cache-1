40|$|The {{protein product}} of the {{regulatory}} gene araC can be synthesized in a cell-free, protein-synthesizing system programmed with a 位paraC+B DNA template. Hybrid, renatured phage DNA molecules prepared with DNA from phages 位paraC+B and 位paraC 3 B (araC 3 is a nonsense mutation) were used to program the cell-free synthesis of the araC protein. The findings observed lead {{to the conclusion that}} the <b>codogenic</b> <b>strand</b> of the araC gene is on the light strand of the phage DNA. The araB gene is on the heavy strand, as determined by DNA路RNA hybridization. Thus, with regard to the standard E. coli map, araC is transcribed in a clockwise direction, whereas transcription of the araBAD operon has a counterclockwise orientation. The technique described should allow one to determine the direction of transcription of any gene that can be incorporated into the genome of a specialized transducing phage...|$|E
40|$|Phage fd RF I DNA 1 about 90 % {{substituted}} by deoxy- 4 -thiothymidine (s 4 Td) in the <b>codogenic</b> <b>strand</b> was synthesized by {{the simultaneous}} actions of DNA polymerase I and DNA ligase. While {{the rate of}} DNA synthesis was considerably reduced, the yield the rate of DNA synthesis was considerably reduced, the yield was not affected {{in the presence of}} s 4 TdTP. The conversion of RF II to RF I DNA by DNA ligase was even improved. This effect seems to be related with an altered ratio of affinity of polymerase and ligase for the s 4 Td-containing substrate. The presence of the base analogue in the DNA was verified independently by chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. The modified genome could be cleaved by restriction endonucleases Hpa II (C/CGG) d and Taq I (T/CGA) d. A number of the fragments produced showed altered mobilities under the conditions of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis...|$|E
40|$|Three {{characteristic}} footprinting patterns {{resulted from}} probing the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase T 7 A 1 promoter complex by hydroxyl radicals in the temperature range between 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C. These {{were attributed to}} the closed complex, the intermediate complex and the open complex. In the closed complex, the RNA polymerase protects the DNA only at one side over five helical turns. In the intermediate complex, {{the range of the}} protected area is extended further downstream by two helical turns. This region of the DNA helix is fully protected, indicating that the RNA polymerase wraps around the DNA between base positions - 13 and + 20. In the open complex, a stretch between base positions - 7 and + 2, which was fully protected in the intermediate complex, becomes accessible towards hydroxyl radicals but only in the <b>codogenic</b> <b>strand,</b> indicating that the DNA strands are unwound. Our data suggest that only the DNA downstream of the promoter is involved in this unwinding process...|$|E
40|$|RF I DNA of phage fd {{containing}} 5 -bromo-deoxyuridine (br 5 Ud) or deoxyuridine (Ud) {{instead of}} deoxythymidine (Td) inthe <b>codogenic</b> <b>strand</b> was synthesized in vitro. The modified genomes could be cleaved by restriction endonuclease Hpa II. Although the recognition site of Hpa II is CCGG, the cleavage rate was significantly reduced with Ud-containing DNA. Both base substitutions altered the mobilities of several DNA fragments under {{the conditions of}} polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The fragments containing binding sites for RNA polymerase were assayed for the rates of stable complex formation. The substitution of Td for both, Ud and br 5 Ud, strongly influenced this parameter. Thus the methyl group of Td has {{to be regarded as}} one of the sites in DNA which determine the rate of stable RNA polymerase binding and thereby possibly mediate promoter activity in vitro (24, 25, 26). In most cases the rate of complex formation was decreased by Ud, but increased by br 5 Ud...|$|E
