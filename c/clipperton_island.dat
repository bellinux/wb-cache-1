5|$|The Galapagos shark {{is found}} mainly off {{tropical}} oceanic islands. In the Atlantic Ocean, it occurs around Bermuda, the Virgin Islands, Madeira, Cape Verde, Ascension Island, Saint Helena and São Tomé Island. In the Indian Ocean, {{it is known}} from Walter's Shoal off southern Madagascar. In the Pacific Ocean, it occurs around Lord Howe Island, the Marianas Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Kermadec Islands, Tupai, the Tuamotu Archipelago, the Hawaiian Islands, the Galapagos Islands, Cocos Island, the Revillagigedo Islands, <b>Clipperton</b> <b>Island,</b> and Malpelo. There are a few reports of this species in continental waters off the Iberian Peninsula, Baja California, Guatemala, Colombia, and eastern Australia.|$|E
5|$|The primary food of Galapagos {{sharks are}} benthic bony fishes (including eels, sea bass, flatfish, flatheads, and triggerfish) and octopuses. They also {{occasionally}} take surface-dwelling prey such as mackerel, flyingfish, and squid. As the sharks grow larger, they consume {{increasing numbers of}} elasmobranchs (rays and smaller sharks, including of their own species) and crustaceans, as well as indigestible items such as leaves, coral, rocks, and garbage. At the Galapagos Islands, this species has been observed attacking Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), and marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). While collecting fishes at <b>Clipperton</b> <b>Island,</b> Limbaugh (1963) noted that juvenile Galapagos sharks surrounded the boat, with multiple individuals rushing at virtually anything trailing {{in the water and}} striking the boat bottom, oars, and marker buoys. The sharks were not slowed by rotenone (a fish toxin) or shark repellent, and some followed the boat into water so shallow that their backs were exposed.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gil was {{the first}} of several {{tropical}} cyclones to affect Hawaii during the 1983 Pacific hurricane season. Gil originated from a tropical depression that developed near <b>Clipperton</b> <b>Island</b> on July 23. Steadily intensifying, it attained tropical storm status six hours later and was upgraded to a hurricane on July 26. After attaining peak intensity on July 27, Gil encountered cooler sea surface temperatures and began to weaken. Moving west-northwest, the weakening system also accelerated and on July 31, was downgraded to a tropical depression. However, Gil began to re-intensify on August1, becoming a tropical storm again later that day. Initially expected to veer north of Hawaii, it continued west-northwest and began to approach the Hawaiian group on August 3. While passing through the island group, Gil reached its secondary peak intensity. Subsequently, Gil began to weaken once again as it threatened the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. After passing through the islands, Gil was downgraded to a tropical depression on August 5. Several hours later, the storm dissipated. The remnants of the storm moved into the West Pacific late on August 6 and were last noted the next morning while passing south of Midway Island.|$|E

40|$|Mineralogical and {{chemical}} analysis of an Eastern Pacific core {{has been conducted}} {{in the context of}} a study of mineralisations in pelagic sediments; the data point out the relations between thin (2 - 100 m) manganese oxyhydroxide concretions and volcano-sedimentary environments. Between Clarion and <b>Clipperton</b> <b>Islands,</b> the polymetallic precipitates are precocious and they are due to the submarine volcanic activity of this spreading zone; in spite of their small size, all the elements are concentrated in the precipitates: Mn (9 - 46 %), Fe (0. 2 - 11 %), Ni (0. 1 - 3. 4 %), Cu (0. 1 - 1. 7 %), Co (0. 1 - 0. 8 %). The high internal structuration of micromineralisations, the splitting up of the elements in the laminations, the variability of contents according to the state of crystallinity can be explained by diagenetic processes at the scale of the grain. The contrast between the degree of evolution of these mineralisations and the situation of the area, that was submitted to important terrigenous and volcanic sedimentary inputs, lead to consideration of the micronodules as 'blocked structures', precursors of nodules, developed from diagenetic reactions of the micro-environment...|$|R
5|$|Throughout the hurricane's track, it posed {{little to}} no threat to any major landmasses or {{populated}} islands. During Celia's early development stages, it brought moderate rainfall to parts of Oaxaca and Guerrero; however, no loss of life or structural damage was reported. Beaches in both states {{increased the number of}} lifeguards on duty since the threat of rip currents would remain high for several days. On June22, the Sistema Nacional de Protección Civil (National System of Civil Protection) in the Mexican state of Jalisco raised the alert level to stage two for coastal areas. People were urged to be cautious about venturing out into coastal waters as the storm produced rough seas near the coast. The alert was later expanded upon to include coastal areas of Michoacán and Colima. Although out of the storm's projected path, a precautionary alert was issued for Socorro Island. However, between June22 and 23, the outer bands of the storm brought unsettled weather to France's <b>Clipperton</b> <b>Island.</b> Since this island is unpopulated, the NHC did not issue any warnings for it.|$|E

50|$|This is a {{very common}} species which is found widely in Indo-Pacific {{tropical}} waters. It is present in numerous regions, including East and South Africa, Madagascar, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, Maldives, eastern Polynesia, Galapagos, <b>Clipperton</b> and Cocos <b>islands</b> off Central America, southern Japan, Midway and Hawaii, and northern New South Wales and Lord Howe Island.|$|R
50|$|Fodiator live {{in marine}} climate {{reaching}} a max length of 19 centimeters. They can most easily {{be found in}} Baja California, Mexico, the Gulf of California to Peru, and the <b>Clipperton</b> and Galapagos <b>Islands.</b> Fodiator will rise {{to the surface of}} the water when the water becomes warm. They even have the ability to leap out of the water and glide in the air for long distances. To reproduce, these fish attach their eggs to small floating objects.|$|R
50|$|However, in {{practice}} even islets are often respected in maritime delimitation. For example, Aves Island was {{considered in the}} United States - Venezuela Maritime Boundary Treaty despite its small size {{and the fact that}} it was uninhabited. Most states do not distinguish between islands and LOSC Art. 121(3) islets, claiming the shelf as an EEZ for all their islands. Examples include the UK's Rockall Island, Japan's Okinotorishima, the United States' Hawaiian Islands and a number of uninhabited islands along the equator, France's <b>Clipperton</b> and other <b>islands</b> and Norway's Jan Mayen.|$|R
25|$|French Polynesia {{is divided}} into five groups of islands: the Society Islands archipelago, {{composed}} of the Windward Islands and the Leeward Islands; the Tuamotu Archipelago; the Gambier Islands; the Marquesas Islands; and the Austral Islands.

40|$|We {{surveyed}} the labrid fishes {{of the eastern}} Pacific ocean at multiple sites before, during, and after the 1997 – 98 ENSO event. Our observations showed that reef fish communities in general {{did not appear to}} change markedly {{as a result of the}} ENSO. Recruitment of labrids at the Galápagos <b>Islands,</b> <b>Clipperton</b> Atoll and Baja California was generally high near the end of the ENSO, indicating no negative effect on populations. Two labrid species did extend their known range during the ENSO: Stethojulis bandanensis settled onto the tip of Baja California and to the Galápagos Islands, while Thalassoma virens recruited heavily to sites along the southern Sea of Cortez in Baja California. We discuss the oceanographic conditions during the ENSO that may have promoted the range extensions. Adults of these species were present in Baja California and Galápagos 2 yrs after the end of the ENSO. Our observations raise the question why these species do not colonize these sites in normal years, given the potential for long larval durations (up to a maximum of 104 d in T. virens) and rapid long-distance transport between islands in the region (recruits of S. bandanensis spent only about 32 d in the plankton) ...|$|R
5000|$|For {{the history}} of the Mexican Cinema, 1943 comes to become one of its most emblematic years.Emilio Fernández was about to become in one of the pillars of the Mexican cinema.Fernández had {{directed}} two films: The Passion <b>Island</b> (<b>Clipperton)</b> (1941) and Soy puro Mexicano (1942), but a project was needed to show the talent of [...] "El Indio" [...] as a director. He needed an interesting film project with technical and human Since 1942, Agustin J.

Fink recalled the previous works of Fernandez and the director felt that deserved the opportunity to direct a film in more appropriate circumstances.The result was better than the wily Fink could have imagined. Thanks to the successful combination of talent, Wild Flower became not only a blockbuster but the starting point for fruitful collaboration between [...] "El Indio" [...] Fernandez and the team that would perform several of his best films: writer Mauricio Magdaleno, photographer Gabriel Figueroa and the leading film couple Dolores del Río and Pedro Armendáriz.Wild Flower is considered the most emblematic film of the filmmaker {{and one of the most}} beautiful films of Mexican cinema.|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of "The Birds of the Galapagos Islands, with Observations all the Birds of <b>Clipperton</b> and Cocos <b>Islands</b> (Columbiformes to Pelecaniformes) ". The collection of land bird skins brought back by the Expedition numbers 5, 916, exclusive of the Galapagos Dove. The writer lacks the time to study this large number of specimens and therefore deems it advisable to publish his field notes without further delay. In addition to the skins, considerable collections of eggs, nests, and birds and stomachs in alcohol were macle. These also await investigation. The land birds of Cocos Island, Costa Rica, and of the Galapagos Islands are treated in the present connection, {{with the exception of the}} Galapagos Dove already considered in the earlier paper. The sequence and nomenclature of species in both papers is that of Sharpe's "Hand-list of the Genera and Species of Birds. " As the species of the genera Geospiza and Camarhynchus demand a thorough revision with all available material at hand, the writer uses provisionally, with a few changes, the specific names as defined by Messrs. Rothschild and Hartert and Messrs. Snodgrass and Heller. Wherever the writer fails to recognize a species admitted by these authors, the rejected name is placed in a. selected synonymy. The localities listed for each species also include those mentioned by Messrs. Salvin, Ridgway, Rothschild and Hartert, and Snodgrass and Heller. For a full, description of the botanical regions or zones (dry or arid, moist or humid, and grassy, in order from seashore to mountain top) mentioned in this paper, the reader should refer to Mr. Alban Stewart's paper "A Botanical Survey of the Galapagos Islands. ...|$|R
500|$|After the United States {{joined the}} Allies, Yorktown {{operated}} {{off the coast}} of Mexico until August 1917, when she paused briefly at San Diego. On 18 July 1917, Yorktown rescued the last surviving members of an abandoned guano mining settlement on <b>Clipperton</b> <b>Island.</b> [...] From a peak population of roughly 100 in 1915, only four women and seven children survived. [...] After her time off the Mexican coast, Yorktown then cruised off the west coasts of Central and South America into 1918. After a refit at Mare Island, Yorktown, sailed for the east coast on 28 April 1918, transiting the Panama Canal en route, and arrived at New York on 20 August. The gunboat escorted a coastal convoy to Halifax, soon there after before returning to New York. She performed local coastwise escort duties through the end of World War I. After a period of upkeep at the New York Navy Yard in December, she departed the east coast on 2 January 1919 on her last voyage to California.|$|E
500|$|Inquisitive and persistent, the Galapagos shark is {{regarded}} as potentially dangerous to humans. However, several live-aboard boats take divers to Wolf and Darwin, the northernmost Galapagos islands, every week specifically to dive in open water with these sharks where they and the scalloped hammerheads accumulate in numbers, and no incidents have been reported. They are known to approach close to swimmers, showing interest in swim fins or hands, and are drawn in large numbers by fishing activities. Fitzroy (1839) observed off St. Paul's Rocks that [...] "as soon as a fish was caught, a rush of voracious sharks was made at him, notwithstanding blows of oars and boat hooks, the ravenous monsters could not be deterred from seizing and taking away {{more than half the}} fish that were hooked". Limbaugh (1963) reported that at <b>Clipperton</b> <b>Island</b> [...] "at first, the small sharks circled at a distance, but gradually they approached and became more aggressive ... various popular methods for repelling sharks proved unsuccessful". The situation eventually escalated to {{the point at which the}} divers had to retreat from the water. Excited Galapagos sharks are not easily deterred; driving one away physically only results in the shark circling back while inciting others to follow, whereas using weapons against them could trigger a feeding frenzy. As of 2008, the Galapagos shark has been confirmed to have attacked three people: one fatal attack in the Virgin Islands; a second fatal attack in the Virgin Islands, at Magens Bay on the north shore of St. Thomas; and a third non-fatal, attack off Bermuda.|$|E
