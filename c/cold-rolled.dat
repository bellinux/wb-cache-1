An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive. For building facades, roofing, and other applications for sheet metal formed by deep drawing, roll forming, or bending, zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used. Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes.|$|E

Pure thorium is very ductile and, as normal for metals, can be <b>cold-rolled,</b> swaged, and drawn. At room temperature, thorium metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure; it has two other forms at exotic conditions, one at high temperature (over 1360°C; body-centred cubic) and one at high pressure (around 100GPa; body-centred tetragonal).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bimetal of high-tin {{aluminum}} alloy and steel was fabricated by <b>cold-rolling</b> process; microstructure, bonding strength and bonding mechanism for bonding interface of the bimetal were investigated under <b>cold-rolling</b> and recrystallization annealing state, respectively. Experimental {{results indicate that}} tin phase of bimetal in <b>cold-rolling</b> state shows a belt type distribution, however, it, in recrystallization annealing state, is uniformly distributed just like some “isolated islands”. A well bonding interface, between layers of high–tin {{aluminum alloy}} and pure aluminum, can be obtained, {{and it is difficult}} to distinguish one layer from the other; but the interface, between layers of low-carbon steel back and pure aluminum, is clear and uneven. And meanwhile, bonding mechanism of bimetal interface, in <b>cold-rolling</b> state, is cold pressure welding and mechanical occluding, But it, in recrystallization annealing state, is cold pressure welding, mechanical occluding, and metallurgic bonding. After recrystallization annealing, at 350 ℃ for 2 h,the bonding strength of bimetal approaches to 92. 4 MPa, which is about 26 % higher than that of <b>cold-rolling</b> state...|$|R

40|$|The {{extended}} band {{structures of}} as-cold-rolled high Cr steel sheets are recrystallisation-resistant, {{and tend to}} become aggregates of the so-called grain colonies as a partially recovered state after final annealing. Such band structures di-minish formability and become origin of the so-called ridging. A novel processing will be shown here, which involves strain-path change by introducing one-pass ECAP prior to <b>cold-rolling,</b> and facilitates recrystallisation. Indeed, the recrys-tallisation temperature was reduced by 100 ˚C, compared with <b>cold-rolling</b> alone imposing an equivalent strain. Grain-scale microshear bands introduced during one-pass ECAP perturbed the banded structures in post-ECAP <b>cold-rolling</b> and enhanced the recrystallisation at the final annealing...|$|R

40|$|During the {{deformation}} of {{low carbon steel}} by <b>cold-rolling,</b> dislocations are created and stored in grains depending on local crystallographic orientation, deformation, and deformation gradient. Orientation dependent dislocation densities have been estimated from the broadening of X-ray diffraction lines measured on a synchrotron beamline. Different <b>cold-rolling</b> levels (from 30 % to 95 % thickness reduction) have been considered. It is shown that the present measurements {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis of the sole consideration of screw dislocations for the analysis of the data. The presented evolutions show that the dislocation density first increases within the α fiber (={hkl}) and then within the γ fiber (={ 111 }). A comparison with EBSD measurements is done and confirms that the storage of dislocations during the deformation process is orientation dependent and that this dependence is correlated to the <b>cold-rolling</b> level. If we assume that this dislocation density acts as a driving force during recrystallization, these observations can explain the fact that the recrystallization mechanisms are generally different after moderate or large strains...|$|R
