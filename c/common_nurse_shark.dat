50|$|The {{smalltooth}} sand tiger or bumpytail ragged-tooth (Odontaspis ferox) is {{a species}} of mackerel shark in the family Odontaspididae, with a patchy but worldwide distribution in tropical and warm temperate waters. They usually inhabit deepwater rocky habitats, though they are occasionally encountered in shallow water, and {{have been known to}} return to the same location year after year. This rare species is often mistaken for the much more <b>common</b> grey <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> (Carcharias taurus), from which it can be distinguished by its first dorsal fin, which is larger than the second and placed further forward. It grows to at least 4.1 m (13.5 ft) in length.|$|R

50|$|<b>Nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are thought}} to take {{advantage}} of dormant fish which would otherwise be too fast for the sharks to catch; although their small mouths limit the size of prey items, the sharks' large throat cavities are used as a sort of bellows valve. In this way, <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> are able to suck in their prey. <b>Nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> are also known to graze algae and coral.|$|R
50|$|The largest species, called {{simply the}} <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> Ginglymostoma cirratum, may reach {{a length of}} 4.3 m; the tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> Nebrius ferrugineus is {{somewhat}} smaller at 3.2 m, and the short-tail <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> Pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum {{is by far the}} smallest at just 75 cm in length. The first of the three species may reach a weight of 110 kg. Yellowish to dark brown in colour, <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> have muscular pectoral fins, two spineless dorsal fins (the second of which is smaller) in line with the pelvic and anal fins, and a tail exceeding one quarter the shark's body length.|$|R
50|$|The Ginglymostomatidae are a {{cosmopolitan}} family of carpet sharks, containing two monotypic genera of <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks.</b> <b>Common</b> in shallow, tropical and subtropical waters, these sharks are sluggish and docile bottom-dwellers. <b>Nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> typically attack humans only if directly threatened.|$|R
50|$|The <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> has two rounded dorsal fins, rounded {{pectoral}} fins, {{an elongated}} caudal fin, {{and a broad}} head. Maximum adult length is currently documented as 3.08 m, whereas past reports of 4.5 m and corresponding weights of up to 330 kg {{are likely to have}} been exaggerated. Adult <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> are brownish in color. Newly born <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> have a spotted coloration which fades with age and are about 30 cm in length when nascent.|$|R
50|$|The short-tail <b>nurse</b> <b>shark,</b> Pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum, is a <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> in {{the family}} Ginglymostomatidae, {{the only member of}} the genus Pseudoginglymostoma.

25|$|Tourism and {{recreational}} {{use of the}} Cape Byron Marine Park has impacted on the populations of Grey <b>Nurse</b> <b>Sharks</b> (Carcharias taurus). Grey <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> maintain the same nursery breeding grounds which are often disturbed by tourism activities such as divers and often the use of shark repellent. Shark netting protected swimmers on beaches has also been linked to mortality of grey <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks.</b> Increased boat traffic, pollution and fishing equipment are also {{a threat to the}} humpback whale on their migratory journey.|$|R

40|$|Complement is {{activated}} via two pathways: classical (CCP) and alternative (ACP). The CCP {{has been demonstrated}} in the <b>nurse</b> <b>shark.</b> The ACP has not been demonstrated in any cartilagenous fish. <b>Nurse</b> <b>shark</b> serum was evaluated for complement activity by its ability to lyse heterologous erythrocytes. As CCP activity requires calcium and magnesium, activity of shark serum chelated with EGTA (a selective calcium chelator) or EDTA (a chelator of calcium and magnesium) was assessed. Activity remained in serum chelated with EGTA but not EDTA. Furthermore, activity of chelated serum was enhanced by added magnesium. Activation of shark complement by activators of mammalian ACP (zymosan, LPS, inulin, CVF) was assessed. Complement was activated by zymosan and LPS.

40|$|In Australia, {{humans can}} dive with {{critically}} endangered grey <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharias taurus) at Fish Rock, New South Wales. This industry {{has the potential}} to improve the environmental knowledge of participants and encourage pro-environmental attitudes within tourists. This study surveyed tourists pre and post participation in grey <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> dives to ascertain if the experience positively influenced the grey <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> knowledge and biocentric attitudes of tourists (short-term). Educational talks were provided to tourists of alternating boat trips to assess if education had a significant impact upon the knowledge and biocentrism of these tourists compared with those that were not provided with a talk. Survey data were collected across eight grey <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> dive boat trips from December 2008 to January 2009. Results indicated that those individuals likely to participate in a grey <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> dive were generally already knowledgeable and biocentric, hence the scope for further improvement was quite narrow. Significant improvements to the grey <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> knowledge and biocentric attitudes of tourists post dive were detected, however the majority of these improvements occurred within tourists already considered to be highly biocentric and knowledgeable pre dive experience. The provision of educational talks significantly improved the knowledge of participants but not their biocentrism. These findings are of importance as they highlight that the contribution the industry may provide to conservation by improving the biocentric attitudes and environmental knowledge of tourists may be minimal. Furthermore, it is important that accurate educational resources are developed and provided to tourists pre and post dive to avoid the development of misconceptions by tourists during grey <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> dives. ...|$|R

5|$|With a more {{streamlined}} form {{than other}} <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks,</b> the tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> {{is believed to}} be a less benthic, more active swimmer. The characteristics of its body, head, fins, and teeth are comparable to other active reef sharks sharing its range, such as the sicklefin lemon shark (Negaprion acutidens). Tawny <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> are primarily nocturnal, though they are said to be active at all hours off Madagascar, and in captivity they will become diurnally active if presented with food. During the day, groups of two dozen or more sharks can be found resting inside caves and under ledges, often stacked atop one another. Individual sharks have small home ranges that they consistently return to each day.|$|R

40|$|Declining {{populations of}} the grey <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> Carcharias taurus have been {{observed}} {{throughout much of the}} species global range. Consequently, the grey <b>nurse</b> <b>shark</b> is listed as vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red-List of Threatened species (IUCN Red – List). In recognition of the decline in sharks more broadly, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) first directed focus toward improved elasmobranch protection through the International Plan of Action for the conservation and management of sharks (IPOA–Sharks). In accordance with the requirements of the IPOA–Sharks, member states agreed to adopt a National Plan of Action (NPOA), if sharks were regularly caught in either directed or non-directed fisheries of their respective jurisdictions. In the current research, I have used the IPOA–Sharks as a benchmark, to critically examine the adequacies of management and the respective legislative processes in place for the protection of grey <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> in three locations: the North–west Atlantic, South Africa and Australia. The effectiveness of the overarching IPOA–Sharks strategy in achieving robust conservation outcomes for grey <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> has also been considered. Finally, an assessment of the science that has historically underpinned policy decisions since the species was initially protected was also undertaken to help identify any shortcomings or potential for improvement. The research indicated that, despite progress in some areas of management since the initial FAO agreement, the effectiveness of the IPOA–Sharks to initiate and influence targeted national actions is limited for some species. While it is evident grey <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks</b> remain vulnerable at a global scale, the species’ inshore distribution and potential for interaction with a number of stakeholders has made management a particularly contentious issue. Alternative strategies to address this challenge have been proposed with the goal of strengthening the future management, conservation and protection of grey <b>nurse</b> <b>sharks,</b> both within Australian waters, and globally...|$|R
