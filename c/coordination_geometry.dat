Commonly, titanium adopts an octahedral <b>coordination</b> <b>geometry</b> in its complexes, but tetrahedral TiCl4 is a notable exception.

40|$|Based on density-functional theory calculations, {{we report}} a {{detailed}} study of the single-molecule charge-transport properties {{for a series of}} recently synthesized biphenyl-dithiol molecules [D. Vonlanthen et al., Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 48, 8886 (2009); A. Mishchenko et al., Nano Lett. 10, 156 (2010) ]. The torsion angle ϕ between the two phenyl rings, and hence the degree of π conjugation, is controlled by alkyl chains and methyl side groups. We consider three different <b>coordination</b> <b>geometries,</b> namely top-top, bridge-bridge, and hollow-hollow with the terminal sulfur atoms bound to one, two, and three gold surface atoms, respectively. Our calculations show that different <b>coordination</b> <b>geometries</b> give rise to conductances which vary by one order of magnitude for the same molecule. Irrespective of the <b>coordination</b> <b>geometries,</b> the charge transport calculations predict a cos^ 2 ϕ dependence of the conductance, which is confirmed by our experimental measurements. We observe that the calculated transmission through biphenyl dithiols is typically dominated by a single transmission eigenchannel formed from π electrons. Only for a single molecule with a completely broken conjugation we find a perfect channel degeneracy for the hollow-hollow-type contact in our theory. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

40|$|Dioxygen-activating {{mononuclear}} and dinuclear metal {{centers of}} non-heme iron proteins often have pseudo-tetrahedral and rhombic five-coordinate geometries with the residual imidazoles and carboxylates, although those structures are less stable than the corresponding square-planar and octahedral {{structures in the}} principles of coordination chemistry. The <b>coordination</b> <b>geometries</b> around the active metal ions are supported and stabilized by the pre-organized protein environments. In the synthetic model studies of these dioxygen-activating metalloproteins, {{it is difficult to}} work tetrahedral distortion around the metal ions with dioxygen-accessible vacant sites. Therefore, we adopted a natural alkaloid, (-) -sparteine (Sp) and its stereoisomers, Į-isosparteine (Į-Sp) and ȕ-isosparteine (ȕ-Sp), for synthesizing the model compounds of the non-heme active metal centers activating dioxygen.

Wells, A. F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry, Oxford Press, Oxford, United Kingdom[...] In the melt, aluminium trichloride exists as the dimer Al2Cl6, with tetracoordinate aluminium.

At higher temperatures, the Al2Cl6 dimers dissociate into trigonal planar AlCl3, which is structurally analogous to BF3. The melt conducts electricity poorly, unlike more ionic halides such as sodium chloride.|$|E
