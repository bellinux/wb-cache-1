30|$|However, {{it should}} be noted that in the {{existing}} literature the basic elements in the single-valued and interval neutrosophic weighted geometric operators consist of <b>crisp</b> <b>values</b> (weights) and SVNSs or INSs. Recently, Gou et al. (2015 a) defined exponential operational laws of IFSs, where the bases are <b>crisp</b> <b>values</b> and the exponents are IFSs, and presented an intuitionistic fuzzy exponential aggregation operator with crisp parameters and its application in MADM problems. Further, Gou et al. (2015 b) defined exponential operational laws of IVIFSs, where the bases are <b>crisp</b> <b>values</b> or interval numbers and the exponents are IVIFSs, and presented the corresponding exponential aggregation operators and their applications in MADM problems. In the existing decision making problems with single-valued neutrosophic information and interval neutrosophic information, the exponential values (weights) of all the existing exponential operational laws of SVNSs and INSs and the corresponding aggregation operators are positive real numbers within the unit interval [0, 1]. Whereas, all the existing exponential operations and aggregation methods cannot handle such an issue where the bases are <b>crisp</b> <b>values</b> or interval numbers and the exponents are SVNSs and INSs. Hence, we lack some important operational laws and aggregation operators with crisp parameters or interval-valued parameters by using SVNSs or INSs as exponents to handle the decision making problems. Motivated by the exponential operational laws of IFSs and IVIFSs and the corresponding exponential aggregation methods (Gou et al. 2015 a, b), it is necessary that we should extend the existing exponential operations of IFSs and IVIFSs to the exponential operational laws of SVNSs and INSs with crisp parameters and interval-valued parameters and propose the corresponding exponential aggregation operators as an important supplement of the existing simplified neutrosophic aggregation techniques. Since INSs reduce to SVNSs when upper and lower ends in interval numbers are equal, this paper only defines the exponential operational laws of INSs with crisp parameters and interval-valued parameters, where the bases are <b>crisp</b> <b>values</b> and interval numbers and the exponents are INSs, and proposes an interval neutrosophic weighted exponential aggregation (INWEA) operator, a dual interval neutrosophic weighted exponential aggregation (DINWEA) operator, and comparative methods for interval neutrosophic numbers (INNs) and dual interval neutrosophic numbers (DINNs). Then, we develop MADM methods by using the INWEA and DINWEA operators, where the data in the decision matrix are given by using <b>crisp</b> <b>values</b> or interval numbers as the evaluation values of attributes and the attribute weights are provided by INNs (basic elements in INS). Finally, we apply these methods to solve the practical problem of selecting the best global supplier for some manufacturing company.|$|R
