40|$|Abstract: This set of {{comparative}} case studies takes some first steps at understanding how to support teachers ’ efforts to adopt and use an inquiry-support software environment called the Progress Portfolio. We explore two key issues: teachers ’ {{beliefs about the}} functionality of the tool, and ways in which teachers customize it to support inquiry-based learning. Using interview data and software artifacts, the study explored some of the striking similarities and differences in beliefs and tool customization across three teachers engaged in the same instructional unit. Findings provide evidence for an initial category scheme of tool functions perceived by teachers to meet both teacher needs and student needs in scientific investigations. Additionally, teachers’ <b>customized</b> <b>Portfolio</b> templates revealed a continuum of general-purpose to task-specific designs to scaffold student inquiry within or across science units. Implications for future research are discussed {{in light of these}} results, including a need to expand on the existing belief category scheme and customization examples, and a need to do longitudinal research that will shed more light on changing beliefs and use as a result of experience...|$|E

40|$|Amidst the {{challenges}} in the Malaysian stock market in recent years (2011 - 2016), this research attempts to test empirically if the risk-return tradeoff can be improved further by applying both the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and value investing strategy. This research applies the MPT framework on the Malaysian stock market using selected value stocks to form an optimal risky portfolio. The portfolio construction process in this study centres on two main questions. The first question is what stocks to select. The second question is what proportion of investment should one allocate to each stock. This paper contributes {{in terms of a}} practical application by demonstrating the construction of minimum variance portfolio, optimal risky <b>portfolio</b> and <b>customized</b> <b>portfolios</b> based on targeted returns and risks. From the model, the weight or proportion of investment in each of the selected stock is determined.

Advantages include the portability from one application or institution to another, wider accessibility of the portfolio, and the reusability of artifacts in different contexts and to create multiple portfolios.

40|$|A {{large body}} of work on new product {{development}} (NPD) has {{identified a number of}} general success drivers, which imply 'best practice' approaches in NPD. In particular, a newer market or a newer technology renders a project riskier and, therefore, requires a higher hurdle rate on returns. Furthermore, a good NPD process exhibits customer orientation and demand pull, cross-functional co-operation, top management support, existence of a champion, good planning and execution with a strong project manager, and the use of a well-defined process with formal measures. Radically new NPD projects require less structure and more exploration than incremental projects. This article examines whether such general 'best practices' are directly applicable to a specific company. We study 90 NPD projects across many different business units in a large diversified European technology manufacturer. We find that the market positioning of new products depends more on the specific portfolio needs of our host company than on general principles of riskiness. In addition, we identify three predominant NPD process approaches in the company, but success differences among them are 'muddled' by the non-targeted way they are used. We conclude that there is no 'best practice' NPD process. Rather, a company should develop a <b>customized</b> NPD project <b>portfolio</b> and a corresponding mixture of processes, which together meet its strategic innovation needs. We develop a systematic procedure that can help a company to achieve such strategic alignment.

40|$|Generalized {{measures}} of deviation, as substitutes for standard deviation, are considered in a framework {{like that of}} classical portfolio theory for coping with the uncertainty inherent in achieving rates of return beyond the risk-free rate. Such measures, associated for example with conditional value-at-risk and its variants, can reflect the different attitudes of different classes of investors. They lead nonetheless to generalized one-fund theorems {{as well as to}} covariance relations which resemble those commonly used in capital asset pricing models (CAPM), but have wider interpretations. A more <b>customized</b> version of <b>portfolio</b> optimization is the aim, rather than the idea that a single “master fund ” might arise from market equilibrium and serve the interests of all investors. The results cover discrete distributions along with continuous distributions, and therefore are applicable in particular to financial models involving finitely many future states, whether introduced directly or for purposes of numerical approximation. Through techniques of convex analysis, they deal rigorously with a number of features that have not been given much attention in this subject, such as solution nonuniqueness, or nonexistence, and a potential lack of differentiability of the deviation expression with respect to the portfolio weights. Moreover they address in detail the previously neglected phenomenon that, if the risk-free rate lies above a certain threshold, a master fund of the usual type will fail to exist and need to be replaced by one of an alternative type, representing a “net short position ” instead of a “net long position ” in the risky instruments...|$|R
40|$|Facing {{the problem}} of {{variation}} and chaotic behavior of customers, the lack of sufficient information {{is a challenge to}} many business organizations. Human analysts lacking an understanding of the hidden patterns in business data, thus, can miss corporate business opportunities. In order to embrace all business opportunities, enhance the competitiveness, discovery of hidden knowledge, unexpected patterns and useful rules from large databases have provided a feasible solution for several decades. While there is a wide range of financial analysis products existing in the financial market, how to <b>customize</b> the investment <b>portfolio</b> for the customer is still a challenge to many financial institutions. This paper aims at developing an intelligent Financial Data Mining Model (FDMM) for extracting customer behavior in the financial industry, so as to increase the availability of decision support data and hence increase customer satisfaction. The proposed financial model first clusters the customers into several sectors, and then finds the correlation among these sectors. It is noted that better customer segmentation can increase the ability to identify targeted customers, therefore extracting useful rules for specific clusters can provide an insight into customers' buying behavior and marketing implications. To validate the feasibility of the proposed model, a simple dataset is collected from a financial company in Hong Kong. The simulation experiments show that the proposed method not only can improve the workflow of a financial company, but also deepen understanding of investment behavior. Thus, a corporation is able to customize the most suitable products and services for customers {{on the basis of the}} rules extracted.

Such measures, derived for example from conditional value-at-risk and its variants, can reflect the different attitudes of different classes of investors. They lead nonetheless to generalized one-fund theorems in which a more <b>customized</b> version of <b>portfolio</b> optimization is the aim, rather than {{the idea that a}} single “master fund ” might arise from market equilibrium and serve the interests of all investors. The results that are obtained cover discrete distributions along with continuous distributions. They are applicable therefore to portfolios involving derivatives, which create jumps in distribution functions at specific gain or loss values, well as to financial models involving finitely many scenarios. Furthermore, they deal rigorously with issues that come up at that level of generality, but have not received adequate attention, including possible lack of differentiability of the deviation expression with respect to the portfolio weights, and the potential nonuniqueness of optimal weights. The results also address in detail the phenomenon that if the risk-free rate lies above a cer-tain threshold, the usually envisioned master fund must be replaced by one of alternative type, representing a “net short position ” instead of a “net long position ” in the risky instruments. For nonsymmetric deviation measures, the second type need not just be the reverse of the first type, and there can sometimes even be an interval for the risk-free rate in which no master fund of either type exists. A notion of basic fund, in place of master fund, is brought in to get around this difficulty and serve as a single guide to optimality regardless of such circumstances...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedPenalization or regularization is an {{important}} integration to the traditional regression method to improve prediction accuracy, speed and adaptability for various problems. Lasso type L 1 -regularization methods and its variants can reduce the complexity of high dimensional data by feature selection as well as coefficient shrinkage. Fan et al. shows that using an L 1 -penalty, which he calls “gross-exposure” constraint on the weights in a portfolio, has significant advantages. In particular it can reduce risk and because the L 1 penalty sets coefficients to zero, many fewer assets are needed in the portfolio, and are therefore suitable for large-scale portfolio optimization problems. Fan et al. formulated this constrained portfolio risk minimization problem into a convex optimization problem and solved the problem by an efficient least angle regression (LARS) optimizer. However, the implementation of LARS used an approximation to the true optimization criterion. To address this problem, we propose a <b>customized</b> coordinate descent <b>portfolio</b> optimization procedure (CCDPO). The coordinate wise updating scheme can optimize all coefficients of the allocation vector faster than LARS. The warming-up and re-initialization steps in CCDPO prevent the dominant coefficients from growing to extreme values. CCDPO uses the advantage of coefficients scarcity to reduce the optimization load and achieves fast speed. To study the performance of CCDPO, we implement a factor-based covariance estimator for data simulation, and a data integration website for collecting real-life stock price quotes. The optimization results on the simulated data show that CCDPO significantly reduces the portfolio risk. And the penalty factor controls the diversity between empirical risk and actual risk {{in a similar fashion}} to the “gross-exposure” constraint.; The ex-post analysis of the real-life Yahoo! Finance data indicates that portfolios optimized by CCDPO have significant less risk than those optimized by the non-constrained optimizer...|$|R
