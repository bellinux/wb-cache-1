5000|$|The polymer {{is formed}} by free-radical {{polymerization}} in aqueous suspension. The fiber {{is produced by}} dissolving the polymer in a solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or aqueous sodium thiocyanate, metering it through a multi-hole spinnerette and coagulating the resultant filaments in an aqueous solution of the same solvent (wet spinning) or evaporating the solvent in a stream of heated inert gas (dry spinning). Washing, stretching, drying and crimping complete the processing. Acrylic fibers are produced {{in a range of}} deniers, usually from 0.9 to 15, as <b>cut</b> <b>staple</b> or as a 500,000 to 1 million filament tow. End uses include sweaters, hats, hand-knitting yarns, socks, rugs, awnings, boat covers, and upholstery; the fiber is also used as [...] "PAN" [...] precursor for carbon fiber. Production of acrylic fibers is centered in the Far East, Turkey, India, Mexico, and South America, though a number of European producers still continue to operate, including Dralon and Fisipe. US producers have ended production (except for specialty uses such as in friction materials, gaskets, specialty papers, conductive, and stucco), though acrylic tow and staple are still spun into yarns in the USA.|$|E
30|$|These {{conductive}} fillers or hybrid yarns can {{be formed}} by using continues filaments like stainless steel or copper wires placed alongside (plied) with non-conducting textile materials, placed as core material with covering {{of textile materials}} or {{in the form of}} discontinuous <b>cut</b> <b>staple</b> fibres (limiting factor), blended together with some non-conductive natural or synthetic textile materials. Rajendrakumar and Thilagavathi (2012), plied polyester filament with 0.04  mm copper wire on a ring doubling machine to investigate the effects of fabric weave and pick density on electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (EMSE). They concluded that the plain weave posed better EMSE as more number of interlacements reduces the contact resistance, they further concluded that the pick density is directly related to increased EMSE.|$|E

40|$|Improved farm {{technology}} helps all main {{groups of}} the poor�-�small farmers, farmworkers, other low-wage labour�-�when it raises labour value-productivity, but raises land and/or water value-productivity faster; and <b>cuts</b> <b>staples</b> prices, but raises smallholders' total factor productivity faster. From 1965 the Green Revolution walked these two tightropes largely by luck. Though targeting bigger piles of rice and wheat, it cut poverty through consumption; nutrition; smallholder income; employment; risk reduction; and ecological sustainability. Yet large areas were left out, and from 1985 progress slowed. In the new environment for research and agriculture, how can transgenics revive and spread poverty reduction? What has been the evidence so far? What determines whether new varieties have traits conducive to poverty reduction: who owns the research, or what crop science is?...|$|R

50|$|Surgical {{procedures}} to lengthen dilated bowel include the Bianchi procedure, where the bowel is {{cut in half}} and one end is sewn to the other, and a newer procedure called serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP), where the bowel is <b>cut</b> and <b>stapled</b> in a zigzag pattern. Heung Bae Kim, MD, and Tom Jaksic, MD, both of Children's Hospital Boston, devised the STEP procedure in the early 2000s. The procedure lengthens the bowel of children with SBS and may allow children to avoid the need for intestinal transplantation. As of June 2009, Kim and Jaksic have performed 18 STEP procedures. The Bianchi and STEP procedures are usually performed by pediatric surgeons at quaternary hospitals who specialize in small bowel surgery.|$|R

The mutilated members are imprisoned in individual chambers. Their female captor gleefully controls and tortures them through the voodoo doll. The members escape, but Hongbin is recaptured. In the end, he completely transforms into a voodoo doll.|$|R
40|$|Critics of the Doha Development Agenda rightly {{point to}} the lack of {{aggressive}} reform in wealthy countries for its role in dampening developing country gains. The authors find that the absence of tariff <b>cuts</b> on <b>staple</b> food products in developing countries also critically limits poverty reduction in those countries. Based on their analysis of the impacts of multilateral trade policy reforms in a sample of 15 developing countries, they find there is some evidence of poverty increases amongst the poor who work in agriculture when they lose protection for their earnings. However, these effects are minimized when agricultural tariffs are cut in all developing countries, and when the impact of lower food prices on low income consumers is taken into account in their 15 country sample. 2009 The Authors.

40|$|Merino sheep {{infested with}} lice (Bovicola ovis) and with 8 months 2 ̆ 7 wool were hand jetted with a {{commercial}} spinosad formulation or treated with an α-cypermethrin backline product {{to examine the}} effect of long wool treatment on lice numbers and wool damage, relative to untreated controls. Mean lice numbers were reduced significantly (P < 0. 05) by treatment and then remained relatively constant until shearing 20 weeks later. Treatment with either product resulted in significant improvements in mean clean and greasy wool <b>cut,</b> yield, <b>staple</b> length, both visually assessed and measured colour, and the proportion of fleeces classed into the main fleece line. There {{was no significant difference between}} the two treatments in either efficacy in reducing louse numbers or on production characters. Wool rub score and cotting assessed on the sheep increased slightly after treatment and then did not change until shearing whereas both scores increased significantly in the untreated group. There was a strong relationship between the visual rub score and the loss of wool at shearing, indicating that rub score can be a good predictor of lice-induced reduction in fleece weights...|$|R

40|$|The {{breakdown}} of the WTO negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda has inspired critics to highlight the lack of {{effort on the part}} of rich countries to reform their agricultural policies. In this paper, we focus instead the poverty impacts of developing country tariff cuts - particularly those in agriculture. We argue that the Doha Development Agenda is fundamentally less poverty-friendly than it could be [...] in large part due to the absence of tariff <b>cuts</b> on <b>staple</b> food products in developing countries. Such cuts would give the poor access to food at world prices, thereby reducing the cost of living at the poverty line. We also explore the contention that such tariff cuts will hurt the poor working in agriculture. Based on our analysis of the impacts of multilateral trade policy reforms on a sample of fifteen developing countries, we find there is some evidence of poverty increases in agriculture. However, such effects are minimized by ensuring that agricultural tariffs are cut in all developing countries. Overall, the poverty-reducing impact of lower food prices dominates; we conclude that the Doha Development Agenda would be more poverty friendly if it were to include deeper cuts in developing country agricultural tariffs. This contrasts sharply with calls for special products exemptions by many developing country advocates. ...|$|R
5000|$|Acrylic fibers are {{synthetic}} fibers {{made from}} a polymer (polyacrylonitrile) with an average molecular weight of ~100,000, about 1900 monomer units. For a fiber to be called [...] "acrylic" [...] in the US, the polymer must contain at least 85% acrylonitrile monomer. Typical comonomers are vinyl acetate or methyl acrylate. DuPont created the first acrylic fibers in 1941 and trademarked them under the name Orlon. It was first developed in the mid-1940s but was not produced in large quantities until the 1950s. Strong and warm, acrylic fiber is often used for sweaters and tracksuits and as linings for boots and gloves, {{as well as in}} furnishing fabrics and carpets. It is manufactured as a filament, then <b>cut</b> into short <b>staple</b> lengths similar to wool hairs, and spun into yarn.|$|R

The very concept of a [...] "director's cut" [...] had little commercial viability until Harvey demonstrated it with this screening. Later, as longer versions of such films as Touch of Evil by Orson Welles began surfacing from studio vaults, director's <b>cuts</b> became a <b>staple</b> of the revival House theater-circuit. (In the 1960s and '70s, before the rise of home video, revival houses" [...] were the only way to see films as their makers intended.) Harvey's passion for film won him friendships with such maverick filmmakers as Peckinpah, Robert Altman, James B. Harris, Monte Hellman, and such actors as Peter O'Toole.|$|R

50|$|Although {{knitting}} may be {{done with}} ribbons, metal wire or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by spinning fibers. In spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in a Z-twist or S-twist yarn. If the fibers are first aligned by combing them, the yarn is smoother and called a worsted; by contrast, if the fibers are carded but not combed, the yarn is fuzzier and called woolen-spun. The fibers making up a yarn may be continuous filament fibers such as silk and many synthetics, {{or they may be}} staples (fibers of an average length, typically a few inches); naturally filament fibers are sometimes <b>cut</b> up into <b>staples</b> before spinning. The strength of the spun yarn against breaking is determined by the amount of twist, the length of the fibers and the thickness of the yarn. In general, yarns become stronger with more twist (also called worst), longer fibers and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension. The thickness of the yarn may vary along its length; a slub is a much thicker section in which a mass of fibers is incorporated into the yarn.|$|R
