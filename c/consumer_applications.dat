5|$|Professional audio subwoofers used in rock {{concerts in}} stadiums, DJ {{performances}} at dance music (e.g., EDM) and similar events must {{be capable of}} very high bass output levels, at very low frequencies, with low distortion. This {{is reflected in the}} design attention given in the 2010s to the subwoofer applications for sound reinforcement, public address systems, dance club systems and concert systems. <b>Consumer</b> <b>applications</b> (as in home use) are considerably less demanding due to much smaller listening space and lower playback levels. Subwoofers are now almost universal in professional sound applications such as live concert sound, churches, nightclubs, and theme parks. Movie theatres certified to the THX standard for playback always include high capability subwoofers. Some professional applications require subwoofers designed for very high sound levels, using multiple 12-, 15-, 18- or 21-inch drivers (30cm, 40cm, 45cm, 53cm respectively). Drivers as small as 10-inch (25cm) are occasionally used, generally in horn-loaded enclosures.|$|E

2500|$|The above {{described}} antennas {{with multiple}} driven elements require a complex feed system of signal splitting, phasing, distribution to the elements, and impedance matching. [...] A {{different sort of}} end-fire array {{which is much more}} often used is based on the use of so-called parasitic elements. In the popular high-gain Yagi antenna, only one of the dipoles is actually connected electrically, but the others receive and reradiate power supplied by the driven element. This time, the phasing is accomplished by careful choice of the lengths as well as positions of the parasitic elements, in order to concentrate gain in one direction and largely cancel radiation in the opposite direction (as well as all other directions). Although the realized gain is less than a driven array with the same number of elements, the simplicity of the electrical connections makes the Yagi more practical for <b>consumer</b> <b>applications.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Early tubes used a {{metal or}} glass {{envelope}} atop an insulating bakelite base. In 1938 a technique {{was developed to}} use an all-glass construction with the pins fused in the glass base of the envelope. This {{was used in the}} design of a much smaller tube outline, known as the miniature tube, having 7 or 9 pins. Making tubes smaller reduced the voltage where they could safely operate, and also reduced the power dissipation of the filament. Miniature tubes became predominant in <b>consumer</b> <b>applications</b> such as radio receivers and hi-fi amplifiers. However the larger older styles continued to be used especially as higher power rectifiers, in higher power audio output stages and as transmitting tubes.Subminiature tubes with a size roughly that of half a cigarette were used in hearing-aid amplifiers. These tubes did not have pins plugging into a socket but were soldered in place. The [...] "acorn tube" [...] (named due to its shape) was also very small, as was the metal-cased RCA nuvistor from 1959, {{about the size of a}} thimble. The nuvistor was developed to compete with the early transistors and operated at higher frequencies than those early transistors could. The small size supported especially high-frequency operation; nuvistors were used in UHF television tuners and some HiFi FM radio tuners (Sansui 500A) until replaced by high-frequency capable transistors.|$|E
