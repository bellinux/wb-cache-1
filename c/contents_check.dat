40|$|Abstract. Internet e-mail {{has become}} one of the most {{important}} ways for people and enterprises to communicate with each other. However, this system, in some cases, is used for malicious purposes. A great problem is the worm and spam spreading. A smart e-mail <b>content</b> <b>checking</b> system can help to detect these kinds of threats. We propose a way to capture, store and display e-mails transactions through SMTP packet sniffing. We worked on pcap files dumped by a packet sniffer containing SMTP traffic packets of a real network. After reassembling the TCP streams and SMTP commands, we store the captured e-mails on a database: for privacy reasons, only e-mails headers are stored. Having a tool for clear understanding and monitoring SMTP transaction may help in manager security tasks...|$|R

40|$|To {{enable the}} {{resource}} discovery of audiovisual documents over the World Wide Web, {{it will be}} necessary to define content description standards or metadata standards for complex, multi-layered, time-dependent information-rich audiovisual data streams. In particular, this is the primary goal of the emerging MPEG- 7 standard, the "Multimedia Content Description Interface" under development by the MPEG group. In the past, a lot of effort has gone into generating descriptors and description schemes for video indexing but comparatively little research has been done on schemas capable of defining the structure, content and semantics of video documents and enabling validation and higher levels of automated <b>content</b> <b>checking.</b> This paper compares the capabilities of the RDF Schema, Extensible Markup Language (XML), Document-type Definitions (DTDs), Document Content Description (DCD), and Schema for Object-Oriented XML (SOX), for supporting and validating hierarchical video descriptions based on Dublin Core, MPEG- 7 and a specific hierarchical-structure. Finally, this paper proposes a hybrid schema based on features from each of these schemas which will satisfy the MPEG- 7 Description Definition Language (DDL) requirements.

40|$|Language {{is at the}} ‘centre of {{what happens}} in the {{classroom}}’ (Manke, 1997 : xvi). Indeed, {{it can be said that}} the classroom is a ‘universe of language’ (Bourdieu & Passeron, 1994 : 19) where what is taught and learnt is done through spoken or written discourse. Within the classroom context, teachers have discursive rights, and are traditionally seen to hold the seat of power. They introduce lesson <b>content,</b> <b>check</b> for understanding, distribute speaking turns, nominate speakers, decide who can have the floor, and evaluate students’ answers. They are institutionally sanctioned to give or withhold praise, commend or criticize, and express approval or disapproval. The findings of the current investigation can add to our understanding of how social relationships are established, maintained and shaped through talk. Given the importance that language plays in teaching and learning, significant insights can be gained from an awareness of how specific linguistic devices can be used strategically to create a supportive, non-threatening classroom environment. The main aim of this article is to provide insights into how the Filipino university lecturers in the study used language to mitigate face threatening acts (e. g. correcting students’ mistakes, issuing a challenge or disagreement and giving orders) thus preserving students’ self-esteem and making the classroom a safe place for learning...|$|R
40|$|The Water {{activity}} R&D project, {{carried out}} in cooperation with ONF and Vilmorin, aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of Water Activity assessment applied to forest seeds and pollen moisture management {{as a replacement for}} moisture content assessment. Water Activity assessment is a quick and non destructive technique to qualify the kind and the chemical potential of water remaining in the sample. The growth of micro-organisms require a specific osmotic pressure, or Water Activity(Aw), between cell walls and medium. The reactivity and depreciating ability of hydrolytic reactions, enzymes activity, lipid oxidation or biotic agents growth are dependent on Aw rather than on MC. Consequently, seeds and pollen preservation implies Water Activity control instead of moisture <b>content</b> <b>check.</b> Water dynamics in seeds and pollen have been described by the mean of sorption isotherms, this demonstrates clearly the variability of forest materials and consequently the poor reliability of moisture content for successful moisture management. As a conclusion, Water Activity assessment appears to be a reliable and a quick method to evaluate the ability of a given sample to be stored successfully. This technique has been transferred and is now regularly being used by Vilmorin and ONF for forest seeds and pollen moisture management...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the added value of structuring the role of both the assessee and the assessor in peer assessment (PA) process in a wiki-based computer-supported collaborative learning environment (CSCL). First year university students, enrolled in an educational sciences program were asked to collaborate in small groups and give feedback on a peers’ performance in a wiki environment. Two subsequent studies were set up. The main aim was to study the product improvement {{and the quality of}} students' feedback. In the first study (conducted in 2012), three conditions were implemented: a non-structured peer feedback condition (NS-PFB), a basic structured peer feedback (BS-PFB) condition and an elaborate structured peer feedback condition (ES-PFB). For the second study, the role of assessee and assessor was additionally structured through respectively a feedback request list and/or a <b>content</b> <b>check</b> list, which resulted in four conditions: a no request - no content condition (NoReq-NoCont), a request – no content condition (Req-NoCont), a no request – content condition (NoReq-Cont) and finally, a request – content condition (Req-Cont). Results of the first study showed that the wiki product improved significantly in the initial phase, but the effect decreases over time. Especially, product improvement was significantly higher for the elaborate condition. From abstract 1 to abstract 3, the peer feedback quality augmented over time for all conditions, but the effect of the elaborated structure condition surpassed the two other conditions. For the second study, it is hypothesized that the request – content condition (Req-Cont) will outperform the other conditions regarding product improvement and peer feedback quality...|$|R

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a reflection and analysis of the methods used to provide useful information and guidance for those who may wish to undertake similar studies, and is of particular relevance for the academic disciplines which have publication and citation norms that may not perform well using traditional tools. Scopus and Google Scholar are discussed and a detailed comparison of the effects of different search methods and cleaning methods within and between these tools for subject and author analysis is provided. The additional database capabilities and usefulness of “Scopus More” in addition to “Scopus General” is discussed and evaluated. Scopus paper coverage is found to favourably compare to Google Scholar but Scholar consistently has superior performance at finding citations to those papers. These additional citations significantly increase the citation totals and also change the relative ranking of papers. Publish or Perish (PoP), a software wrapper for Google Scholar, is also examined and its limitations and some possible solutions are described. Data cleaning methods, including duplicate checks, expert domain checking of bibliographic data, and <b>content</b> <b>checking</b> of retrieved papers are compared and their relative effects on paper and citation count discussed.
