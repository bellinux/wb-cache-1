5|$|Discovery {{procedures}} for defendants began with adoption of state {{laws in the}} 1920s. In the following decades, courts began instituting new procedures. In 1962, for example, the California Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>ordered</b> reciprocal discovery rules, without an initial law requiring it. However, a series of problems surfaced with this judicially imposed system. Not only did both sides refuse to share intended testimony, but no 'alibi notice rule' was fashioned, leading to an unworkable position for both sides. In 1974, the California Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>ordered</b> the legislature to create the discovery system, ending the state's experiment with judicial discovery rule-making.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} extract and analyse correct {{precedent}} cases and <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> is critical because recommending correct <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> {{is of utmost}} importance in ensuring that every case is trialed accordingly. Currently, precedent cases and <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> are searched and extracted manually thus, causing backlog in juvenile delinquency trials. This paper discusses {{the development of a}} Juvenile Delinquency Legal Reasoning (JDLRes) Model that has the ability to imitate human reasoning in assisting probation officer to recommend <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> for juvenile delinquency cases. Rule-based reasoning (RBR) and case-based reasoning (CBR) are the techniques used to add consistency with flexibility when recommending <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> for new cases. The simulation model was developed to validate JDLRes Model. The comparison results between the model and human expert reveal the existence of generality aspect in the legal domain. Future work requires the study of precedent cases and <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> in different states in Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|The Court {{considered}} an appeal from a district <b>court</b> <b>order</b> modifying a child custody decree. The Court affirmed in part and reversed {{in part the}} Eight Judicial District <b>Court’s</b> <b>order.</b> The <b>Court</b> affirmed the District <b>Court’s</b> <b>order</b> barring modification of certain child support arrearages. The Court reversed the District Court’s award of primary physical custody to the child’s nonparty grandparents...|$|R
5|$|Although the High <b>Court</b> <b>ordered</b> {{that the}} verdict of the {{original}} conviction be overturned and that a retrial be conducted, {{there was never any}} retrial since Dietrich had already served his sentence. Dietrich was released on parole in July 1990, and he subsequently changed his name by deed poll to Hugo Rich.|$|E
5|$|More {{construction}} was funded {{in part by}} $1million from the Works Progress Administration; the airport expanded to fill the square mile in 1938–41 after a <b>court</b> <b>ordered</b> the Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad to reroute tracks that had crossed the square along the northern edge of the older field.|$|E
5|$|Thorne {{then brought}} suit {{in federal court}} to {{overturn}} the discharge; the <b>court</b> <b>ordered</b> his reinstatement while the case proceeded. After he lost his challenge to DADT in both U.S. District Court and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal on October 19, 1998, and he was again discharged.|$|E

5000|$|It is an {{established}} procedure in the UK for rights-holders to use 'Section 97' <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> to require ISPs to block copyright-infringing sites. For instance, <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> {{obtained by the}} BPI in October 2013 resulted in the blocking of 21 file-sharing sites including FilesTube and Torrentz. There is a private agreement in principle between leading ISPs and rights holders, made with encouragement from government, to quickly restrict access to websites when presented with <b>court</b> <b>orders.</b> The <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> are not made public and [...] "overblocking" [...] is sometimes reported, such as the accidental blocking of the Radio Times, Crystal Palace F.C., Taylor Swift and over 100 others websites in August 2013.|$|R
50|$|Breach of a <b>court</b> <b>order</b> can {{be civil}} {{contempt}} of court, and {{a warrant for}} the person's arrest may be issued. Some <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> contain authority for a police officer to make an arrest without further order.|$|R
5|$|By May 2014, private {{forecasts}} estimated annual inflation at 39.9%, one of {{the highest}} rates in the world. In July 2014, a ruling from a New York <b>court</b> <b>ordered</b> the country to pay the remaining holders of the bonds defaulted in 2001, which by then were mostly American Vulture funds, before it paid any of its exchange bondholders. The Argentine government refused, causing the country to default on its debt again.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, three African-American {{students}} {{brought a}} case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to Murphy High School. This was nearly {{a decade after the}} United States Supreme Court had ruled in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. The federal district <b>court</b> <b>ordered</b> that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County's school system.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2010, the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>ordered</b> {{the appeals}} court to reconsider its {{decision}} to rescind the death penalty, with the same three-judge panel convening in Philadelphia on November 9, 2010, to hear oral argument. On April 26, 2011, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed its prior decision to vacate the death sentence {{on the grounds that}} the jury instructions and verdict form were ambiguous and confusing. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in October.|$|E
50|$|A {{self-executing}} {{order is}} a type of <b>court</b> <b>order.</b> <b>Court</b> <b>orders</b> are usually made with only immediate effect, and without any future effect. With a self-executing order, an order is made by a court that a party to a legal matter must comply with a request by a future date or be subject to legal sanctions. If the party does not comply with the request, the sanctions will apply with no further <b>court</b> <b>order</b> required.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the duty}} to provide child support is {{separate}} from the civil requirement to obey a <b>court</b> <b>order</b> regarding visitation, it is exceptionally rare for a parent to be jailed for violating {{that part of the}} <b>court</b> <b>order.</b>|$|R
50|$|The California Oak Foundation {{challenged}} {{the construction of}} the fence in Hayward court, saying it violated a previous <b>court</b> <b>order</b> banning construction on the site.

Noriega was extradited to Panama on December 11, 2011, and incarcerated at El Renacer prison to serve time for crimes committed during his rule.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland <b>court</b> <b>ordered</b> him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Crimean crisis, the Ukrainian government, in April 2014, {{announced}} that it would halt all military-technical cooperation with Russia. In August 2014, a Ukrainian <b>court</b> <b>ordered</b> the Russian Defence Ministry to make outstanding payments to Antonov. In March 2015, Russia Defence Ministry declared that it is ruling out the An-70 for state procurement. It also declared that, as in their opinion, Ukraine has withdrawn from the military and defence agreements signed before the crisis between them by completing the aircraft without Russian involvement, it would request return of 2.95 billion rubles that Russian government had spent on An-70 project.|$|E

5|$|Dr. John Lescher was a {{business}} partner and friend of Thomas S. Hinde. Both men invested in the Wabash Navigation Company. Lescher later joined Hinde's children in {{a lawsuit against the}} company. Not long after the death of Hinde, his son James and his son-in-law Charles H. Constable joined with Lescher and sued the company for entering their land and taking timber and other materials for the construction of dam. But, the company's charter permitted them to enter the land and take construction material without the owner's consent, forcing the owner to seek legal redress. The <b>court</b> <b>ordered</b> compensation.|$|E
5|$|Noriega was extradited to France on April 26, 2010. Noriega's lawyers {{claimed the}} La Santé Prison, {{at which he}} was held, was unfit {{for a man of}} his age and rank; the French {{government}} refused to grant him prisoner of war status, which he had in the United States. On July 7, 2010, Noriega was convicted by the 11th chamber of the Tribunal Correctionnel de Paris and sentenced to seven years in jail. The prosecutor in the case had sought a ten-year prison term.

5|$|The Civil Rights Movement gained many {{participants}} in the 1960s. It achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1964 the United States Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>ordered</b> Prince Edward County and others to integrate schools. In 1967, the Court also struck down the state's ban on interracial marriage with Loving v. Virginia. From 1969 to 1971, state legislators under Governor Mills Godwin rewrote the constitution, after goals such as the repeal of Jim Crow laws had been achieved. In 1989, Douglas Wilder became the first African American elected as governor in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|A stay of {{execution}} is a <b>court</b> <b>order</b> to temporarily suspend the execution of a court judgment or other <b>court</b> <b>order.</b> The word [...] "execution" [...] {{does not necessarily mean}} the death penalty; it refers to the imposition of whatever judgment is being stayed.|$|R

5|$|According to Australian court documents, on 10 January 2006, the Šibenik County <b>Court</b> <b>ordered</b> that {{a warrant}} be issued for Vasiljković's arrest. The {{offences}} listed were two alleged war crimes against prisoners of war, and one alleged war crime against the civilian population. The latter {{are related to}} {{his role in the}} attack on Glina which caused civilian deaths and injuries. He was arrested in Australia in 2006, but as an Australian national, he appealed against extradition to Croatia claiming that he would not get a fair trial there. The appeal was granted by the Federal Court in 2009, and Vasiljković was released. However, the High Court of Australia overturned the decision and Vasiljković was arrested after a 43-day search for him by the police. Subsequently, Vasiljković appealed against his extradition citing other grounds. His extradition was approved by the Minister for Home Affairs Jason Clare in November 2012, however Vasiljković appealed that decision as well. In December 2014, the Federal Court upheld Clare's decision.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{arriving}} in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination {{because of his}} skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He {{was not allowed to}} sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban <b>court</b> <b>ordered</b> Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} the National Reconciliation Ordinance amnesty was unconstitutional, which {{cleared the way for}} the revival of {{corruption}} cases against Zardari. Though Zardari had immunity from prosecution because he was President, the end of NRO and his earlier corruption cases challenged the legality of his presidency. Calls for his resignation escalated. Zardari, who rarely left the Aiwan-e-Sadr presidential palace, responded with a nationwide spurt of speeches in January 2011. In January 2010, the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>ordered</b> Pakistan's government to reopen Zardari's corruption charges in Switzerland. However, Zardari prevented the MQM-leaning Attorney General, Anwar Mansoor, from filing charges, so Mansoor resigned in protest in early April. That same month, Zardari won a key victory against the judiciary over his corruption trials when Geneva Attorney General Daniel Zappelli stated that Zardari can not be prosecuted under international laws because of his presidential immunity. Zardari was supported by Prime Minister Gilani, who defied the Supreme Court order.|$|E
50|$|Accompanying deinstitutionalization was the {{development}} of laws expanding the power of <b>courts</b> to <b>order</b> people to take psychiatric medication on an outpatient basis. Though the practice had occasionally occurred earlier, outpatient commitment was used for many people who {{would otherwise have been}} involuntarily committed.
