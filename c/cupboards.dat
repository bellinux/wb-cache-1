5|$|The {{position}} of Keeper of the Archives at the University of Oxford in England dates from 1634, {{when it was}} established by new statutes for the university brought in by William Laud (Archbishop of Canterbury and Chancellor of the University). The first holder of the post was Brian Twyne, who prepared an index of the archives in 1631 {{as part of the}} preparatory work for the statutes: he was appointed Keeper of the Archives as a reward for his work. The archives were moved from the University Church of St Mary the Virgin into the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library under Twyne and his successor, and some of the storage <b>cupboards</b> built at that time are still in use. The archives include charters, title deeds, university registers and records, and other official documentation from the university (but not from the colleges of the university, which keep their own archives). Most of the material dates from the 19th and 20th centuries, with few photographs and no sound or video recordings.|$|E

Several of these 'mysria' contain <b>cupboards</b> and other conveniences; they have doors which can be locked, and keys for their occupiers.

It often happens that a man can be in his cabin without others on board realizing it, {{and they do not}} see him until the vessel has arrived in some port. The sailors also have their {{children}} in such cabins; and (in some parts of the ship) they sew garden herbs, vegetables, and ginger in wooden tubs. The Commander of such a vessel is a great Emir; when he lands, the archers and the Ethiops (i.e. black slaves, yet in China these men-at-arms would have most likely been Malays) march before him bearing javelins and swords, with drums beating and trumpets blowing. When he arrives at the guesthouse where he is to stay, they set up their lances {{on each side of the}} gate, and mount guard throughout his visit.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} of Keeper of the Archives at the University of Oxford dates from 1634. The university's records pre-date this, and it {{claims to have}} one of the longest continuous record-keeping traditions in Britain. Records were initially kept in the Priory of St Frideswide (the site of the present-day Christ Church), moving to the University Church of St Mary the Virgin in the 14th century, where they were housed with money and other valuables. The archives were left in considerable disarray by a burglary in 1544, and remained in chaos until Brian Twyne attended to them in the 17th century. As part of his work {{as a member of the}} committee preparing new statutes for the university (at the request of the Chancellor of the University, William Laud), Twyne prepared an index of the archives by 1631, and was appointed the first Keeper of the Archives under the revised statutes in 1634 as a reward for his work. Under Twyne and Gerard Langbaine, his successor as Keeper, the archives were moved into one of the rooms in the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library; three of the wooden <b>cupboards</b> that were built at that time to store them are still in use.|$|E

40|$|A {{push-pull}} fume <b>cupboard</b> shown is {{an innovative}} device to remove pollutants from a fume <b>cupboard</b> to the outdoor environment. A push flow {{coming from the}} bottom of a sash and a pull flow behind the doorsill are adopted to form an air curtain in the fume <b>cupboard.</b> Meanwhile, the roof of a push-pull fume <b>cupboard</b> is open to the environment and ambient fluids are drawn from the roof. To investigate the performance of a push-pull fume <b>cupboard,</b> a numerical model based on the finite volume method is utilized. Various ratios of push flows to pull flows are considered. Four characteristic flow fields are found at a variety of speed ratios. They are concave curtain, straight curtain, under suction and over blow modes. According to numerical results, a concave curtain mode with a fast pull flow and a weak push flow is recommended for the operation of a push-pull fume hood. Furthermore, the manikin effect on the flow filed of a push-pull fume hood is also examined in this study. A manikin is located in front of the fume <b>cupboard</b> according to the ANSI/ASHRAE 110 / 1995 standard. Numerical results reveal that fluid flows in a push-pull fume <b>cupboard</b> are not affected by a manikin. As a result, an operator {{standing in front of a}} push-pull fume <b>cupboard</b> is protected from pollutants inside the <b>cupboard...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A fume <b>cupboard</b> is {{equipment}} {{used to carry}} out chemical reaction process in its working chamber. A suction fan takes air or gas from the working chamber and releases it outside. When the air or gas is flowing from the inlet to the outlet, some recirculation zones may be formed depending on the internal shape design of the fume <b>cupboard.</b> This recirculation zone may create back flow that can {{be the cause of}} leakage. Leakage happens when airborne contaminants escape through inlet of the fume <b>cupboard</b> to the user breathing zone and the surrounding air in the room. To have a good fume <b>cupboard,</b> the recirculation zone needs to be minimised. In this paper, the flow characteristic of a Servco fume <b>cupboard</b> will be presented as a result of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation using κ-ω turbulence model. The results are presented in terms of velocity components at different cross sections of the fume <b>cupboard...</b>|$|R

In addition, the cloister often contained a fountain or well, where the monks could wash and draw water to drink. The single, double, and even triple and quadruple capitals of 12th-century cloisters' columns were carved with foliate forms derived from the Classical period, such as vine scrolls and acanthus leaves, real and imaginary animals in combat or in heraldic positions, secular images such as musicians, entertainers, hunters, saints' lives and biblical events. Piers bore narrative scenes or relief figures of apostles or saints.|$|E
