Evidence suggested that <b>clomethiazole</b> is metabolized directly to both NLA- 715 and NLA- 272. Injection of NLA- 715, NLA- 272 or NLA- 511 (each at 600 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1) produced brain concentrations respectively 2. 2, 38 and 92 times greater than seen after <b>clomethiazole</b> (600 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1). <b>Clomethiazole</b> (600 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1) injected 60 [*]min after a 5 [*]min bilateral carotid artery occlusion in gerbils attenuated the ischaemia-induced degeneration of the hippocampus by approximately 70 %.

40|$|Prisms {{of adult}} rat cortex were {{maintained}} in vitro in either aerobic conditions (control) or conditions simulating an acute ischaemic challenge (hypoxia with no added glucose).

40|$|The {{immediate}} effect of administration of 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ‘ecstasy') on rectal temperature {{and the effect}} of putative neuroprotective agents on this change has been examined in rats. The influence of the temperature changes on the long term MDMA-induced neurodegeneration of cerebral 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) nerve terminals was also examined. The novel low affinity N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channel blocker AR-R 15896 AR (20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) given 5 [*]min before and 55 [*]min after MDMA (15 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) did not prevent the MDMA-induced hyperthermia and did not alter either the MDMA-induced neurodegenerative loss of 5 -HT and 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA) in cortex, striatum and hippocampus or loss of [3 H]-paroxetine binding in cortex 7 days later. The neuroprotective agent <b>clomethiazole</b> (50 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) given 5 [*]min before and 55 [*]min after MDMA (15 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) abolished the MDMA-induced hyperthermic response and markedly attenuated the loss of 5 -HT, 5 -HIAA and [3 H]-paroxetine binding in the brain regions examined 7 days later. When rats treated with MDMA plus <b>clomethiazole</b> were kept at high ambient temperature for 5 [*]h post-MDMA, thereby keeping their body temperature elevated to near that seen in rats given MDMA alone, the MDMA-induced loss of 5 -HT, 5 -HIAA and [3 H]-paroxetine was still attenuated. However, the protection (39 %) afforded by the <b>clomethiazole</b> administration was less than seen in rats kept at normal ambient temperature (75 %). These data support the proposals of others that NMDA receptor antagonists are neuroprotective against MDMA-induced degeneration only if they induce hypothermia and further suggest that increased glutamate activity may not be involved in the neurotoxic action of MDMA. These data further demonstrate that a proportion of the neuroprotective action of <b>clomethiazole</b> is due to an effect on body temperature but that, in addition, the compound protects against MDMA-induced damage by an unrelated mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A new {{rating scale}} for the {{quantitative}} assessment of the alcohol-withdrawal syndrome (AWS) was developed from the CIWA-A scale by item analysis based on the data from 132 alcoholic patients. The clinical evaluation of this AWS scale in a second sample of 256 alcoholic patients showed that it adequately assessed the course and severity of the AWS. The AWS scale provides data for a rational strategy of therapy for the AWS by rating mental and somatic symptoms on different scales, hi particular, the mental subscale allows prediction of a complicated AWS. Subjects with an AWS score> 10 at admission have {{a higher risk of}} becoming delirious than those with a lower score (46. 6 % vs 2. 8 %, P < 0. 001). In order to minimize the prescription of drugs with abuse potential, such as diazepam and <b>clomethiazole,</b> a structured treatment programme of in-patient alcohol detoxification based on the AWS score was also developed. The comparison revealed that, in the second sample, which was treated following this protocol, the number of cases given medication was lower and the amount of <b>clomethiazole</b> prescribed per patient was less...|$|E
40|$|<b>Clomethiazole</b> (CMZ), a neuroprotective drug, has {{antiinflammatory}} actions. We {{investigated the}} effects of CMZ administration on plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 8, IL- 1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and neutrophil adhesion molecule expression during experimental extracorporeal circulation. Five healthy volunteers each donated 500 mL of blood, which was subsequently divided into equal portions. Identical extracorporeal circuits were simultaneously primed with donated blood (250 mL) and circulated for 2 h at 37 degrees C. CMZ was added to 1 of the circuits of each pair to achieve a total plasma concentration of 40 micro mol/L. Blood samples were withdrawn at (i) donation, (ii) immediately after addition of CMZ, and at (iii) 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after commencing circulation. Plasma concentrations of IL- 6, IL- 8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were less in the CMZ group compared with control after 60 min of circulation (2. 2 [0. 3] versus 3. 2 [0. 4], 14. 9 [4. 8] versus 21. 9 [18. 4], 63. 3 [43. 5] versus 132. 2 [118. 9] pg/mL, respectively, P < 0. 05). After 120 min of circulation, neutrophils from CMZ-treated circuits showed significantly less CD 18 expression compared with control (237. 5 [97. 4] versus 280. 5 [111. 5], P = 0. 03).

40|$|In hippocampal slices, {{inhibition}} of AMPA receptors unmasks synaptic transmission via NMDA receptors, suggesting that AMPA receptor activation normally inhibits synaptic transmission via NMDA receptors. Activation of NMDA receptors {{is involved in}} the pathogenesis of cortical spreading depression (CSD) which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine aura and neuronal damage from pen-infarct depolarizations. In this study we examined whether NMDA receptor transmission could be unmasked in the neocortex in vivo by AMPA receptor blockage and whether AMPA receptors could affect CSD induced by 200 mM KCl. We further compared the effects of AMPA to those of the NMDA receptor antagonist, 2 -amino- 5 -phosphono-pentanoic acid (2 AP 5), and the GABA-mimetic drug <b>clomethiazole.</b> The NMDA receptor antagonist MK- 801 did not affect the baseline somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). In a medium with no Mg 2 +, the AMPA receptor antagonist 6, 7 -dinitroquinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione (DNQX) caused marked reduction in the SEP size which subsequently recovered partially; MK- 801 blocked these partially recovered SEPs. AMPA (50 mu M but not at 5 mu M or 250 mu M) and 2 AP 5 (10 mu M) significantly reduced the number of CSD cycles. The effect of AMPA was not changed by co-applying it with cyclothiazide, which blocks AMPA receptor desensitization. <b>Clomethiazole</b> (100 mg/kg i. p.) did not significantly affect the number of CSD cycles. Only 2 AP 5 significantly reduced the potentiation that follows CSD. We conclude that activation of AMPA receptors can suppress the actions of NMDA receptors in the neocortex; this could be an intrinsic protective mechanism against CSD and also provide a possible therapeutic strategy against CSD-related neurological conditions.

40|$|Substance use {{disorders}} (SUD) include {{substance abuse}} and dependence as well as acute intoxication, withdrawal, and various psychiatric disorders. In {{the course of the}} SUD, severe comorbid disorders and somatic consequences can occur. The treatment of withdrawal symptoms focuses on the relief of immediate symptoms and the prevention of complications. The treatment of SUDs should achieve long-term abstinence with relapse prevention or harm reduction using maintenance treatment strategies. Beside psychosocial interventions, the pharmacotherapy has become an important factor for the treatment of SUDs and withdrawal syndromes. This review reports evidence-based pharmacologic treatment strategies of the most frequent SUDs according to current guidelines for SUDs. In the pharmacological treatment of alcohol dependence long-lasting benzodiazepines or <b>clomethiazole</b> for alcohol withdrawal, and acamprosate or naltrexone for relapse prevention are preferable. There exists no effective relapse prevention for cannabis dependence. During cocaine withdrawal tricyclic antidepressants demonstrated the highest efficacy. For cocaine dependence no medication can be recommended, so far. However, mood stabilizers such as topiramate and tiagabine or disulfirame were found to be efficacious in preliminary studies. There is consistent evidence for methylphenidate in treating cocaine dependence co-occurring with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. For opioid dependence, methadone or buphrenorphine treatment is the pharmacotherapy of first choice. Nicotine replacement therapy, Bupropion and Vareniclin are efficacious in smoking cessation...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} whether dopamine {{plays a role}} in the neurodegeneration of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) {{nerve endings}} occurring in Dark Agouti rat brain after 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ‘ecstasy') administration. Haloperidol (2 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. p.) injected 5 [*]min prior and 55 [*]min post MDMA (15 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. p.) abolished the acute MDMA-induced hyperthermia and attenuated the neurotoxic loss of 5 -HT 7 days later. When the rectal temperature of MDMA+haloperidol treated rats was kept elevated, this protective effect was marginal. MDMA (15 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) increased the dopamine concentration in the dialysate from a striatal microdialysis probe by 800 %. L-DOPA (25 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. p., plus benserazide, 6. 25 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. p.) injected 2 [*]h after MDMA (15 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) enhanced the increase in dopamine in the dialysate, but subsequent neurodegeneration was unaltered. L-DOPA (25 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) injected before a sub-toxic dose of MDMA (5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) failed to induce neurodegeneration. The MDMA-induced increase in free radical formation in the hippocampus (indicated by increased 2, 3 - and 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid in a microdialysis probe perfused with salicylic acid) was unaltered by L-DOPA. The neuroprotective drug <b>clomethiazole</b> (50 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. p.) did not influence the MDMA-induced increase in extracellular dopamine. These data suggest that previous observations on the protective effect of haloperidol and potentiating effect of L-DOPA on MDMA-induced neurodegeneration may have resulted from effects on MDMA-induced hyperthermia. The increased extracellular dopamine concentration following MDMA may result from effects of MDMA on dopamine re-uptake, monoamine oxidase and 5 -HT release rather than an ‘amphetamine-like' action on dopamine release, thus explaining why the drug does not induce degeneration of dopamine nerve endings...|$|E
40|$|Administration of 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ‘ecstasy') to mice {{produces}} acute hyperthermia {{and long-term}} degeneration of striatal dopamine nerve terminals. Attenuation of the hyperthermia decreases the neurodegeneration. We {{have investigated the}} mechanisms involved in producing the neurotoxic loss of striatal dopamine. MDMA produced a dose-dependent loss in striatal dopamine concentration 7 days later with 3 doses of 25 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 (3 [*]h apart) producing a 70 % loss. Pretreatment 30 min before each MDMA dose with either of the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists AR-R 15896 AR (20, 5, 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) or MK- 801 (0. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 × 3) failed to provide neuroprotection. Pretreatment with <b>clomethiazole</b> (50 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 × 3) was similarly ineffective in protecting against MDMA-induced dopamine loss. The free radical trapping compound PBN (150 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 × 3) was neuroprotective, but it proved impossible to separate neuroprotection from a hypothermic effect on body temperature. Pretreatment with the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor 7 -NI (50 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 × 3) produced neuroprotection, but also significant hypothermia. Two other NOS inhibitors, S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 × 3) and AR-R 17477 AR (5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 × 3), provided significant neuroprotection and {{had little effect on}} MDMA-induced hyperthermia. MDMA (20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) increased 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid formation from salicylic acid perfused through a microdialysis tube implanted in the striatum, indicating increased free radical formation. This increase was prevented by AR-R 17477 AR administration. Since AR-R 17477 AR was also found to have no radical trapping activity this result suggests that MDMA-induced neurotoxicity results from MDMA or dopamine metabolites producing radicals that combine with NO to form tissue-damaging peroxynitrites...|$|E

Serum S 100 B levels are altered in different neuropsychiatric disorders but not well investigated in alcohol withdrawal syndromes. Because {{of the close}} connection of S 100 B to ACTH and glutamate secretion that both are involved in neurodegeneration and symptoms of alcoholism the relationship of S 100 B and homocysteine to acute withdrawal variables has been examined. A total of 22 male and 9 female inpatients (mean age 46. 9  ±  9. 7  years) with an ICD- 10 diagnosis of alcohol addiction without relevant affective comorbidity were examined on admission and after 24, 48, and 120  h during withdrawal. S 100 B and homocysteine levels in serum were collected, and severity of withdrawal symptoms (AWS-scale), applied withdrawal medication, initial serum ethanol levels and duration of addiction were recorded. Serum S 100 B and homocysteine levels declined significantly (P < . 05) over time. Both levels declined with withdrawal syndrome severity. Females showed a trend to a more intense decline in serum S 100 B levels compared to males at day 5 (P = . 06). Homocysteine levels displayed a negative relationship to applied amount of <b>clomethiazole</b> (P < . 05) and correlated with age of onset of addiction. No withdrawal seizures were recorded during the trial. As it is known for homocysteine, S 100 B revealed to decline rapidly over withdrawal treatment in alcoholism.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} GHB for treatment of AWS and prevention of relapse Thirteen randomised controlled trials involving 648 participants were included in this review. Eleven of these were conducted in Italy. However, {{there is not enough}} reliable evidence from the research that has been done to date to be confident of a difference between GHB and placebo, or to determine reliably if GHB is more or less effective than other drugs for the treatment of alcohol withdrawl or the prevention of relapses. Six trials with a total of 286 participants evaluated the effectiveness of GHB in reducing withdrawal syndrome. These compared the drug with a variety of other interventions, making it impossible to use them all in a single analysis. One study suggests that GHB might reduce withdrawal symptoms more than a placebo, but this is based on {{a very small number of}} patients. No strong differences were observed between GHB and benzodiazepines or <b>Clomethiazole.</b> In the other comparisons, the differences were not statistically significant. Seven trials involving 362 participants tested the use of GHB to treat alcohol dependence or prevent relapses if a person was already detoxified (mid-term outcomes). These included several different comparisons, so each analysis was able to include only one or two trials; and the trials were generally small (range 17 to 98 participants). GHB did appear to be better than Naltrexone and Disulfiram in maintaining abstinence and preventing craving, based on two trials and one trial respectively for these comparisons. The most consistently reported side effect of GHB was dizziness and vertigo, with this being more common at higher doses. The findings of this review should be considered alongside concerns that have been raised about GHB regarding the risk of developing addiction, and the misuse or abuse of the drug, suggesting to use GHB only under strict medical surveillance...|$|E
40|$|Enzyme {{induction}} is {{a process}} whereby a molecule enhances the expression of enzymes. If the affected enzymes {{are involved in the}} elimination of a drug, this may result in a drug interaction. Induction is therefore of major concern during drug development and in clinical practice. The induction process depends on the half-life of the induced enzyme, the pharmacokinetics of the inducing agent, and the relationship between the inducer’s concentration and the induction stimulus. The aim of the conducted research was to investigate these key aspects of enzyme induction and the consequences that induction has for substrate elimination. Successful investigations of the induction process presuppose the existence of appropriate methods for the estimation of the metabolic activity. Enzyme activity measurements can be conducted in tissues with low enzyme content using the analytical method presented here. A model was developed describing the changes in the pharmacokinetics of <b>clomethiazole</b> and its metabolite NLA- 715, that are attributable to carbamazepine induction. The consequences of the induction was explained using a mechanistic approach, acknowledging food-induced changes in the blood flow to the liver, and interpreting in vitro generated metabolic information. The time course of the induction process was examined in two investigations. In the first of these, the pharmacokinetics of the autoinducing drug phenobarbital and its effect on several enzymes were described in rats. This was accomplished by integrating the bidirectional interaction between drug and enzymes in a mechanistic manner. In the final investigation, the time course of the increase and cessation in enzyme activity was studied in healthy volunteers treated with carbamazepine. This investigation allowed the half-lives of CYP 3 A and CYP 1 A 2 to be estimated. The key aspects of the enzyme induction process have been examined using mechanistic induction models. These novel models improve the understanding of the induction process and its consequences for substrate elimination...|$|E
40|$|Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) {{is a short}} chain {{fatty acid}} endogenously {{produced}} within {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) and acts as a precursor and metabolite of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although, it is an illegal recreational drug of abuse, its sodium salt (sodium oxybate) has been utilized as a medication for a number of medical conditions. The first aim of this review was to focus on current applications of sodium oxybate for the treatment of narcolepsy, with a particular emphasis on the key symptoms of this disorder: cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Secondly, the effectiveness of sodium oxybate therapy for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) and the maintenance of alcohol abstinence has been assessed. Nowadays, sodium oxybate is the first-line treatment for narcolepsy and it is highly effective in meliorating sleep architecture, decreasing EDS and the frequency of cataplexy attacks in narcoleptic patients. Sodium oxybate currently finds also application in the treatment of AWS and the maintenance of alcohol abstinence in alcoholics. Most of the studies evaluating the efficacy of GHB in the treatment of AWS use a dosage of 50 mg/kg divided in three or four administrations per day. Human studies showed that GHB (dose of 50 mg/kg, divided in three administrations per day) is capable {{to increase the number of}} abstinent days, reduce alcohol craving and decrease the number of drinks per day. However, there is limited randomized evidence and, thus, GHB cannot be reliably compared to <b>clomethiazole</b> or benzodiazepines. Some randomized data suggest that GHB is better than naltrexone and disulfiram regarding abstinence maintenance and prevention of craving in the medium term i. e. 3 - 12 months. It is recommended that GHB should be used only under strict medical supervision, since concerns about the abuse/misuse of the drug and the addiction potential have been arisen...|$|E
