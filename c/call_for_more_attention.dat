One hundred English teachers completed an online questionnaire measuring the four levels of reflective teaching, i. e., pre-reflection, surface reflection, pedagogical, and critical reflection. The results of the multivariate ANOVA showed that Iranian English teachers mainly reflected at the pedagogical level in their classrooms. Critical, surface, and pre-reflection constituted the next levels they reflected on their practice. A significant relationship was found between teachers’ qualifications and years of experience and the pedagogical and critical reflection levels.

Species of beetle and spider were sampled almost exclusively from single islands, while soil dwelling Collembola exhibited more than tenfold higher species sharing among islands. Comparison of Collembola mitochondrial metagenomic data to a database of more than 80, 000 Collembola barcode sequences revealed almost 30 % of sampled island species are genetically identical, or near identical, to individuals sampled from often very distant geographic regions of the world. Patterns of mtDNA relatedness among Collembola implicate human-mediated species introductions, with minimum estimates for the proportion of introduced species on the sampled islands ranging from 45 - 88 %.
