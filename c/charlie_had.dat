5|$|Upon {{reaching}} the Gulf of Mexico, <b>Charlie</b> <b>had</b> weakened to a 105mph (165km/h) hurricane. On August 21, it remained a Category2 hurricane while crossing the Gulf of Mexico until 18hours before landfall. On August 22, Charlie rapidly intensified, and it strengthened {{to a second}} peak of 135mph (215km/h) off the mainland Mexican coast. Later, Charlie made landfall near Tampico with 125mph (200km/h) sustained winds. The strongest winds were {{believed to have been}} north of the eye, and were unrecorded. The storm quickly weakened over land, and it dissipated on August 23 in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|Charlie {{has barely}} made it into his new flat in London when his father dies suddenly. Charlie hurries home for the funeral, where he finds the factory near bankruptcy. The factory makes good quality men's shoes, {{but they are not}} stylish and not cheap, and the market for them is drying up. Charlie is {{determined}} to save the factory and his father's legacy, though he has no desire to run Price & Sons himself. The workers, many of whom have known Charlie his entire life, do not understand why <b>Charlie</b> <b>had</b> moved away in the first place, and many are hostile and skeptical of the new management.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Charlie {{developed}} on August21 {{to the southwest}} of the Cape Verde islands. At the time, the Weather Bureau did not consider Charlie to be a tropical cyclone until almost a week later. For four days, the storm tracked generally to the west as a weak tropical storm. On August25, it turned to the northwest and intensified, becoming a hurricane on August28. On August30, Charlie attained peak winds of 110mph (175km/h), although the Hurricane Hunters estimated higher winds. At the time, the hurricane was stalled to the east-southeast of Bermuda, and subsequently turned to a westward drift. On September2, Charlie turned {{to the north and}} northeast. At the time, it co-existed with two other hurricanes, Dog and Easy; it is a rare occurrence for three hurricanes to exist simultaneously in the Atlantic. Charlie slowly weakened and lost tropical characteristics, and by September5 <b>Charlie</b> <b>had</b> transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 480mi (775km) southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It dissipated later on September5 without having affected land.|$|E

25|$|Soong's {{career as}} a missionary {{proved to be a}} short one. In the late 1880s, <b>Charlie</b> <b>had</b> begun to tire of the mission and felt that he could do more for his people if he was not bound to the {{restrictions}} and methods that came with working for the church. When he founded his first business—a small printing establishment—he seemingly found it appropriate to resign from preaching. Instead, another society required his time and loyalty. Around this time, <b>Charlie</b> <b>had</b> secretly been initiated into Shanghai’s thriving anti-Manchu resistance movement, more specifically an organization that went by the name of Hung P’ang, or the Red Gang. This organization had its roots in the movements to reinstate the Ming dynasty {{in the latter part of}} the 17th century, but had since transformed into a republican revolutionary force.|$|E

500|$|In 1932, {{the comedy}} writer Billy Wells adapted Baron Munchausen for a radio comedy routine {{starring}} the comedians Jack Pearl and Cliff Hall. In the routine, Pearl's Baron would relate his unbelievable experiences {{in a thick}} German accent to Hall's [...] "straight man" [...] character, Charlie. When <b>Charlie</b> <b>had</b> had enough and expressed disbelief, the Baron would invariably retort: [...] "Vass you dere, Sharlie?" [...] The line became a popular and much-quoted catchphrase, and by early 1933 The Jack Pearl Show was the second most popular series on American radio (after Eddie Cantor's program). Pearl attempted to adapt his portrayal to film in Meet the Baron in 1933, playing a modern character mistaken for the Baron, but the film was not a success. Pearl's popularity gradually declined between 1933 and 1937, though he attempted to revive the Baron character several times before ending his last radio series in 1951.|$|E

Peter Dyke, writing for British tabloid the Daily Star, branded Charlie as [...] "Sexy" [...] and states: [...] "Most fellas would not mind feeling the strong arm of the law if this beauty was their local police officer."

500|$|Burton and August {{also worked}} {{together}} in creating Wilbur Wonka, Willy's domineering dentist father. Burton thought the paternal character would help explain Willy Wonka himself and that otherwise {{he would be}} [...] "just a weird guy". The element of an estranged father-son relationship had previously appeared in Big Fish, similarly directed by Burton and written by August. Warner Bros. and the director held differences over the characterizations of Charlie Bucket and Willy Wonka. The studio wanted to entirely delete Mr. Bucket and make Willy Wonka the idyllic father figure <b>Charlie</b> <b>had</b> longed for his entire life. Burton believed that Wonka {{would not be a}} good father, finding the character similar to a recluse. Burton said, [...] "In some ways, he's more screwed up than the kids."

500|$|Charlie has {{received}} critical analysis through her storylines and persona and opinion has been mixed. Ruth Deller of Lowculture said <b>Charlie</b> <b>had</b> endured [...] "scandalous-headline-grabbing-faux-lesbianity", whilst Holy Soap stated {{that she has}} a [...] "questionable taste in men." [...] Charlie has been ill-received by Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail because of her on-off relationship with Angelo and Stephen regularly expresses her general dislike of the character in her column. In contrast, the Daily Star liked Charlie's image, which they branded [...] "sexy", and the Daily Record praised her for the drama she creates.

2500|$|Gehringer {{was born}} on May 11, 1903 on a rented farm in Iosco Township, south west of Fowlerville, Michigan, in southwestern Livingston County, Michigan. He was the second son of Leonard Gehringer and Theresa (Hahn) (Eisele) Gehringer, both German Catholic immigrants. Both of his parents had been married previously, and <b>Charlie</b> <b>had</b> eight half-siblings from Leonard's first marriage, and a {{half-sister}} from his mother's first marriage.

2500|$|In 1894, Charlie Soong {{made the}} arguably most {{important}} connection {{in his life}} when he met Sun Yat-Sen at a Sunday service in a Methodist church in Shanghai. The two men were kindred spirits of sorts, sharing their Western education, region of birth, dialect, the Christian faith and a burning ambition and craving for change in China. Perhaps most importantly, they were both members of entwined anti-Manchu triads. They quickly became good friends and Charlie started funding Sun’s campaigns. [...] A political body was set up, and {{the plan was to}} connect the triads into a network of opposition. When their first attempt at uprising failed in 1895, Sun fled China, and would not come back until sixteen years later. <b>Charlie</b> <b>had</b> remained incognito during the resistance and deemed it safe to remain in Shanghai, as his name had not yet been connected to the failed coup. In the coming years, Charlie Soong funded Sun Yat-Sen’s travels in search of support and major financial backing.|$|E
2500|$|Nick was not {{away from}} Walford for long. In 1991, he {{returned}} with a heroin addiction but Dot initially shunned him and ignored his pleas for help. It was only after discovering <b>Charlie</b> <b>had</b> died that Nick was her only family left and was determined to reform him. Discussing the storyline, Altman has said: [...] "I found the heroin addiction quite exhausting actually, because I grew a really thick beard and my hair was always really filthy. When I was shooting those scenes I met {{with a guy who}} was an addict, and he told me things that you go through, like you can’t relax when you’re trying to come off it. You can‘t sleep so you drink loads of alcohol to try and kill the pain. The clock barely seems to move. For me as an actor, they really let me go as far as I could on that. We had letters as well from people saying how it‘s put them off heroin for life, so I guess we did a good job." [...] As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey with the help of Pete Beale. During this period, The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle is murdered. The murder was the key storyline of the show during the autumn of 1991. The episode Eddie was murdered was written by Tony McHale, it finished with a cliffhanger featuring Clyde Tavernier in the gardens standing over Eddie's body and holding a knife, which Nick witnessed from his bedroom window. Nick tells the police what he saw, leading to Clyde going on the run with the help of Michelle Fowler. Joe Wallace eventually came forward, saying he saw Nick out on the square on the night of Eddie’s murder, having escaped his room and climbed down a drain pipe. Nick confesses to Dot that he was responsible but insists that it was an accident. Nick is subsequently arrested and charged with Eddie’s murder and he stands trial in January 1993. A week's worth of episodes were devoted to the trial, and were all written by Tony Jordan. To present the story of Nick's trial the programme-makers themselves had to review the evidence and watch the episodes leading up to the death of Eddie. In the end, although it was clear that Nick was responsible for stabbing Eddie, it was not clear that it was murder and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Altman summarised: [...] "Through having a really good defence and lying his head off once again, he got away with murder".|$|E
