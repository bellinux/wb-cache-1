This reduces the need to construct new power lines and increases the amount of electric power sent to population centres. Series <b>compensation</b> <b>is</b> based on capacitor technology. To maintain its transmission system performance, TransÉnergie sets aside funds for research and application of new technologies. In addition to power transmission technology, Hydro-Québec plans to offer high-speed internet over its transmission lines within a few years; the utility started testing internet over its lines in January 2004.|$|E
