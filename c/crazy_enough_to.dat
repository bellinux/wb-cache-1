When he goes to the past, he finds himself lying to a pretty girl to impress her, a lie that causes him to end up having to joust with her potential husband. As time passes, however, Chris proves himself to be much braver than he appears. In fact, Chris single-handedly kills de Kere, the one man <b>crazy</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> kill them all.|$|E
500|$|... "Precipice" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad felt that Sharon Agathon {{coming to the}} fleet was a [...] "surprising development" [...] and the cliffhanger was [...] "unbelievable", adding [...] "are the writers actually <b>crazy</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> mass kill so many main characters to the series? Is it possible at all that they can actually get out of this?" [...] Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode a [...] "masterful" [...] 10 out of 10, stating [...] "watching the season premiere of Battlestar Galactica is a great reminder that this is truly still the best show on television." [...] Ian Berriman of SFX reacted positively towards the episode, stating [...] "Although {{there are a couple}} of great surprises in this episode – Casey, the Great Escape-homaging finale – the highlights are a fistful of fabulous face-offs: Baltar discussing the bombing with Roslin; Roslin questioning Tigh's methods; Apollo telling Adama that his plan is madness. James Callis's performance as the haggard, tortured Baltar is outstanding." [...] Berriman rated the episode five stars out of five. Patrick Sauriol of UGO felt that although it was set a year since [...] "Lay Down Your Burdens", it [...] "hasn't lost a thing by jumping ahead," [...] and that the episode, along with [...] "Occupation", [...] "confirm that it's still the best show on television." [...] Sauriol graded both episodes an A-. Television Without Pity gave the episode an A+, a higher grade than the previous episode.|$|E

40|$|Mathematics {{is logical}} <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to}} detect the {{internal}} logics of poetry and <b>crazy</b> <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> lag behind the poetic ineffable ” (Solomon Marcus). The author of this article aims a statistical investigation of a recently published volume of poetry [3], which will make possible some more general conclusions on the evolution of poetry in the XXth century (either the literary current hermetism, surrealism or any other). Certain modifications in the structure of poetry, occurred in its evolution from classicism to modernism, are also presented. Men of letters have never agreed with mathematics and, especially, with its interference in art. Let us quote one of them: “Remarque que, a mon avis, tout literature est grotesque…(…) La seule excuse de l’écrivain c’est de se rendre compte qu’il joue, que la littérature est un jeu ” (Eugène Ionesco). Well, if literature is a game why could not be subjected to mathematical investigation? The book chosen for this study (see [3]) contains 44 poems (from which the first and the last are sort of poems essays on Romanian poetry). It comprises over 250 sentences, over 700 verses, over 2, 500 words and over 11, 700 letters (not sounds) ...|$|R
50|$|The Decreator {{started to}} erase things from {{existence}} slowly at first, giving Kipling and DP member <b>Crazy</b> Jane <b>enough</b> time <b>to</b> slow it down. Jane, or rather Jane's alternate persona Lucy Fugue, {{explained that the}} Decreator {{was nothing more than}} a vibration, a wavelength, created by God. Using the famous Sagrada Família as a spiritual tuning fork and a method of occult geometry, Jane sent out an opposing vibration which slowed down the Decreator so much that the speed of things disappearing wouldn't be noticed. Ironically, Nùrnheim itself was decreated at the last second but not before Cliff and the Book escaped. The Cult hasn't made any reappearances yet.|$|R

60|$|MINNIE. There wasn't {{anything}} providential about it. I {{took the}} six o'clock train to Newcastle this morning. Not that I had {{any notion of}} staying there. I ran into Prag at the station. I nursed his wife, you know--and he started in {{to tell me how}} he was coming up to Foxon Falls to shoot Mr. Pindar because he'd closed down the works rather than recognize the union. I knew that Prag was just about <b>crazy</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> do it, because I've heard Dr. Jonathan talk about the mental disease he's got. That was about ten, and the train for Foxon Falls was leaving in a few minutes. I ran into the booth to phone Dr. Jonathan, but the storm had begun down there, and I couldn't get a connection. So I caught the train, and when it pulled in here I saw Pray jump out of the smoking car and start to run. I couldn't run as fast as he could, and I'd only got {{to the other side of}} the Common when I saw him walk into the house.|$|E

I turned to Bourke and Grouard in such an appealing way as promptly to evoke the appalling information that no worse insult could possible be visited upon an Indian host than to refuse to eat liberally of such sacred offerings under such momentous auspices. Then one fiendish glance from <b>Crazy</b> Horse was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> induce the swallowing of anything. I can only add that I did my best and can taste that offensively strong, oily dog meat and glimpse its bloody, bristling backbone and tail hairs like a loathsome nightmare to this day. The Indians lapped theirs up greedily to the last rough-gristle, greasy drop, and gleaming hair, and I felt regarded as threateningly for not doing so likewise.” ...|$|R

An old, long-faced, long-bodied servant in quaint livery, who {{attended}} upon my uncle, threw down an armful of wood beside the fire-place, gave a queer look about the room, and then wished him bon repos, with a grimace and a shrug {{that would have been}} suspicious from any other than an old French servant. The chamber had indeed a wild, <b>crazy</b> look, <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> strike any one who had read romances with apprehension and foreboding. The windows were high and narrow, and had once been loop-holes, but had been rudely enlarged, as well as the extreme thickness of the walls would permit; and the ill-fitted casements rattled to every breeze. You would have thought, on a windy night, some of the old Leaguers were tramping and clanking about the apartment in their huge boots and rattling spurs. A door which stood ajar, and like a true French door would stand ajar, in spite of every reason and effort to the contrary, opened upon a long, dark corridor, that led the Lord knows whither, and seemed just made for ghosts to air themselves in, when they turned out of their graves at midnight. The wind would spring up into a hoarse murmur through this passage, and creak the door to and fro, as if some dubious ghost were balancing in its mind whether to come in or not. In a word, it was precisely the kind of comfortless apartment that a ghost, if ghost there were in the chateau, would single out for its favourite lounge.|$|R
