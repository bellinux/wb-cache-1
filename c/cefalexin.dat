Each of these drugs has a unique XRD pattern that makes their identification possible.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cefalexin</b> {{can treat}} certain {{bacterial}} infections, {{including those of}} the middle ear, bone and joint, skin, and urinary tract. It may also be used for certain types of pneumonia, strep throat, and to prevent bacterial endocarditis. <b>Cefalexin</b> is not effective against infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus, or Pseudomonas. Like other antibiotics, <b>cefalexin</b> cannot treat viral infections, such as the flu, common cold or acute bronchitis. <b>Cefalexin</b> can be used in those who have mild or moderate allergies to penicillin. However, it is not recommended in those with severe penicillin allergies.|$|E
25|$|Like other β-lactam antibiotics, renal {{excretion}} of <b>cefalexin</b> is {{delayed by}} probenecid.

25|$|<b>Cefalexin,</b> also spelled cephalexin, is an {{antibiotic}} that can treat {{a number of}} bacterial infections. It kills gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria by disrupting {{the growth of the}} bacterial cell wall. <b>Cefalexin</b> is a beta-lactam antibiotic within the class of first-generation cephalosporins. It works similarly to other agents within this class, including intravenous cefazolin, but can be taken by mouth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cefalexin</b> is {{a useful}} {{alternative}} to penicillins in patients with penicillin intolerance. For example, penicillin is the treatment of choice for respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus, but <b>cefalexin</b> {{may be used as}} an alternative in penicillin-intolerant patients. Caution must be exercised when administering cephalosporin antibiotics to penicillin-sensitive patients, because cross sensitivity with beta-lactam antibiotics has been documented in up to 10% of patients with a documented penicillin allergy.|$|E
25|$|Common {{brand names}} for <b>cefalexin</b> include Keflex, Cepol, Ceporexine, Ceporex, Cefadal, Derantel, Mecilex, Medoxine, Sporibest (Bionova), Xahl, and Tokiolexin.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cefalexin</b> {{can treat}} {{a number of}} {{bacterial}} infections including: otitis media, streptococcal pharyngitis, bone and joint infections, pneumonia, cellulitis, and urinary tract infections.

25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of an allergic reaction include rash, itching, swelling, trouble breathing, or red, blistered, swollen, or peeling skin. Overall, <b>cefalexin</b> allergy occurs in less than 0.1% of patients, but it is seen in 1% to 10% of patients with a penicillin allergy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{adverse effects of}} <b>cefalexin,</b> like other oral cephalosporins, are {{gastrointestinal}} (stomach area) disturbances and hypersensitivity reactions. [...] Gastrointestinal disturbances include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, diarrhea being most common. [...] Hypersensitivity reactions include skin rashes, urticaria, fever, and anaphylaxis. Pseudomembranous colitis and Clostridium difficile have been reported with use of <b>cefalexin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cefalexin</b> is a {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic of the cephalosporin family. [...] It is bactericidal {{and acts}} by inhibiting {{synthesis of the}} peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall. As <b>cefalexin</b> closely resembles d-alanyl-d-alanine, an amino acid ending on the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall, {{it is able to}} irreversibly bind to the active site of PBP, which is essential for the synthesis of the cell wall. It is most active against gram-positive cocci, and has moderate activity against some gram-negative bacilli. However, some bacterial cells have the enzyme β-lactamase, which hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring, rendering the drug inactive. This contributes to antibacterial resistance towards cephalexin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{commonly}} quoted {{figure of}} 10% {{of patients with}} allergic hypersensitivity to penicillins and/or carbapenems also having cross-reactivity with cephalosporins originated from a 1975 study looking at the original cephalosporins, and subsequent [...] "safety first" [...] policy meant this was widely quoted and assumed to apply to {{all members of the}} group. Hence, it was commonly stated that they are contraindicated in patients with a history of severe, immediate allergic reactions (urticaria, anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis, etc.) to penicillins, carbapenems, or cephalosporins. [...] This, however, should be viewed in the light of recent epidemiological work suggesting, for many second-generation (or later) cephalosporins, the cross-reactivity rate with penicillin is much lower, having no significantly increased risk of reactivity over the first generation based on the studies examined. The British National Formulary previously issued blanket warnings of 10% cross-reactivity, but, since the September 2008 edition, suggests, in the absence of suitable alternatives, oral cefixime or cefuroxime and injectable cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone can be used with caution, but the use of cefaclor, cefadrocil, <b>cefalexin,</b> and cefradine should be avoided.|$|E
