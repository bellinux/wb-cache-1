5|$|As {{champions of}} the Atlantic Coast Conference, Virginia Tech was awarded an {{automatic}} bid to the Orange Bowl game. The automatic ACC bid {{was the result of}} an off-season deal following the inaugural ACC <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> which granted the winner of the ACC <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl unless it was ranked high enough in the Bowl Championship Series standings to play in the National <b>Championship</b> <b>Game.</b>|$|E

On December 12, less than two weeks after Jacksonville had hosted the 2007 ACC <b>Championship</b> <b>Game,</b> the ACC announced that Tampa, Florida would host the game in 2008 and 2009 and Charlotte, North Carolina would host the game in 2010 and 2011.|$|E

5|$|The 1932 NFL season {{resulted}} in a tie for first place between the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans, {{and could not be}} resolved by the typical winloss system. To settle the tie, a playoff game was played; Chicago won the game and the championship. The following year, the NFL split into two divisions, and the winner of each division would play in the NFL <b>Championship</b> <b>Game.</b> In 1967, the NFL and the rival AFL agreed to merge, effective following the 1969 season; as part of this deal, the NFL champion from 1966 to 1969 would play the AFL champion in an AFL–NFL World <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> {{in each of the four}} seasons before the completed merger. The NFL <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> was ended after the 1969 season, succeeded by the NFC <b>Championship</b> <b>Game.</b> The champions of that game play the champions of the AFC <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> in the Super Bowl to determine the NFL champion.|$|E

5|$|The ACC <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> {{traditionally}} {{matches the}} winner of the Coastal and Atlantic Divisions of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Prior to 2005, no <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> existed. The idea for a <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> originated with the league's 2004expansion, which added former Big East members Miami, Virginia Tech, and (in 2005) Boston College. A request to the National Collegiate Athletic Association by conference officials to hold a <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> following the 2004 season was rejected because the ACC lacked the requisite 12teams, and so the league's first <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> had to wait until after Boston College's addition, which had been delayed at the school's request. With the addition of Boston College, the ACC consisted of 12 teams, allowing it to hold a conference <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> under NCAA rules. Before the start of the 2005 season, both Virginia Tech and Florida State were picked as pre-season favorites to play in the <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> in an annual poll conducted by members of the media who cover the ACC.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> {{was held}} in Jacksonville, Florida, on December 3, 2005, with Florida State (champions of the Atlantic Division) {{defeating}} Virginia Tech (Coastal Division champions), 2722.

The 2007 game saw Virginia Tech return to the contest, this time facing off against Boston College. In their second ACC <b>Championship</b> <b>Game,</b> Tech defeated Boston College, 3016.|$|E

5|$|By contract, the top {{two teams}} in the BCS Poll at the {{conclusion}} of the regular season were invited to the BCS national <b>championship</b> <b>game.</b> In 2000, the BCS Poll was a combination of four different systems: media and coaches' polls (Associated Press college football poll and USA Today Coaches' Poll), team records, a collection of eight different computer ranking systems, and a strength-of-schedule component based on opponent records. Under the BCS, the site of the national <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> rotated every year. In 2000, there were four BCS bowl games: the Rose Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, the Orange Bowl, and the Fiesta Bowl. The national <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> rotated to a different location each year, and the other three games served as bowl games for lower-ranked teams. Later, in 2007, the BCS National Championship was created, adding a fifth BCS bowl. In 2000, the Sugar Bowl was scheduled to host the national <b>championship</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E

5|$|Florida State earned its bid to the ACC <b>Championship</b> <b>game</b> by {{fighting}} through an Atlantic Division schedule that included several nationally ranked teams.

Additional losses to North Carolina State and Clemson {{at the end of}} the season almost eliminated the Seminoles from contention for a spot in the <b>championship</b> <b>game,</b> but losses by Clemson and the other Atlantic Division leaders gave the Seminoles a second chance and set up an ACC <b>Championship</b> <b>game</b> between Florida State and Virginia Tech. The two teams had previously played in the 2000 National <b>Championship</b> <b>Game,</b> and the rematch served as a point of public interest.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2006 ACC <b>Championship</b> <b>Game,</b> the Gator Bowl Association, which {{administered}} the ACC <b>Championship</b> <b>Game</b> {{during its first}} two years of existence, was awarded a one-year extension to its two-year contract to host the game. The 2006 game suffered from poor attendance, resulting in over $1million in losses for the Gator Bowl Association. In the off-season, the Gator Bowl Association declared that if sales did not improve for the 2007 ACC <b>Championship</b> <b>game,</b> the game's Jacksonville future would be in jeopardy. Attendance for the 2006 game was low due to high travel costs stemming from Jacksonville's distance from the participating schools, and the 2007 participants—Boston College and Virginia Tech—faced the same problem.|$|E
5|$|Following the Iron Bowl, Alabama's bowl {{destination}} was unclear {{due to the}} SEC <b>championship</b> <b>game,</b> which determined the conference champion on December 5. Until then, speculation centered on Alabama potentially attending any of four games: the Peach Bowl, Independence Bowl, Sun Bowl, or Music City Bowl. By {{the time of the}} <b>championship</b> <b>game,</b> the Sun Bowl had been eliminated as an option. After Tennessee won the SEC <b>championship</b> <b>game</b> and a bid to the Fiesta Bowl, other teams were selected by the Peach Bowl and Independence Bowl, leaving Alabama to be selected for the inaugural Music City Bowl. The choice was made official on December 6, and Alabama began preparing for its matchup with Virginia Tech.|$|E
