40|$|Abstract. The {{scheduling}} {{of metal}} to different casters in a <b>casthouse</b> {{is a complicated}} problem, attempting to find the balance between pot-line, crucible carrier, furnace and casting machine capacity. In this paper, a description will be given of a <b>casthouse</b> modelling system designed to test different scenarios for <b>casthouse</b> design and operation. Using discrete-event simulation, the <b>casthouse</b> model incorporates variable arrival times of metal carriers, crucible movements, caster operation and furnace conditions. Each {{part of the system}} is individually modelled and synchronised using a series of signals or semaphores. In addition, an easy to operate user interface allows for the modification of key parameters, and analysis of model output. Results from the model will be presented for a case study, which highlights the effect different parameters have on overall <b>casthouse</b> performance. The case study uses past production data from a <b>casthouse</b> to validate the model outputs, with the aim to perform a sensitivity analysis on the overall system. Along with metal preparation times and caster strip-down/setup, the temperature evolution within the furnaces is one key parameter in determining <b>casthouse</b> performance...|$|E
40|$|After the {{financial}} crisis in 2008, demand reduction especially from the automotive in-dustry and changes in CO 2 tax regulations which increased the energy prices the alu-minium industry forced to review and reduce its operational expenditure. High energy consumption {{in the production of}} primary aluminium dedicates most of the efforts on technological development onto the electrolysis unit. However, other units of a smelter also have the potential to improve their operational efficiency. In this thesis, {{the focus is on the}} <b>casthouse</b> unit of the smelter. The aim of this research is to quantify and reduce the non-value added logistical costs in the aluminium industry’s supply chain. This re-search attempts to simulate the internal supply chain of a primary aluminium <b>casthouse</b> and identify the wastes by implementing a lean thinking approach. After highlighting the possible improvements, optimization models attempt to reduce these wastes which create non-value added costs to the system. This concept is further developed by inter-facing the simulation model with the optimization model to validate the improvements. The success of the concept is tested by measuring the reduction in redundant logistical costs of a case study founded on the real <b>casthouse</b> specifications. Scenarios are defined to analyze the <b>casthouse</b> supply chain under different perspectives. The potential gain of the new concept is verified by applying it to these scenarios.

40|$|International audienceRefractory castables {{based on}} aluminous {{hydraulic}} binders {{are commonly used}} in aluminium <b>casthouses</b> (furnaces, ducts, etc.). Their selection is based on their good mechanical strength, thermal behavior and compatibility with molten aluminium. However, few studies focus on their hydrous evolution in operation, whereas this property can also have an influence on the produced metal quality. In this article, the internal moisture of twelve hardened cement pastes fired at high temperature, made with four aluminous hydraulic binders and three different Water/Binder ratios was registered under diverse thermo-hydrous conditions, including at high temperature. The water trapped by physisorption and chemisorption can be significant for some products, and it strongly depends on the mineralogy and porosity of the hardened cement paste. The more the binders contain alumina phase, the more the hardened cement pastes mobilize and render moisture...|$|R
40|$|Sodium is {{well known}} to be a cause for edge {{cracking}} during rolling of aluminium-magnesium alloys (AA 5 xxx). Due to this, requirements for the sodium contents in Al-Mg alloys are often less than 1, 0 ppm. The electrolytic produced aluminium have a sodium content in the range of 30 to 200 ppm, where the highest levels are present in the most modern pot lines. To reduce sodium and other impurities like oxides and carbides several techniques are available for <b>casthouses</b> today. Furnace fluxing and degassing with chlorine gas has been in use for a long time. Due to issues related to health, safety and the environmental, the industry is trying to reduce or replace its use of chlorine gas. Salt mixtures with magnesium chloride or aluminium fluoride have the possibility to remove alkaline and alkaline earth metals in liquid aluminium. Aluminium fluoride can, however, only be used when magnesium free aluminium are processed. Magnesium chloride can on the other hand be used when magnesium is present, and can thermodynamically reduce the sodium concentration to less than 1 ppm. In the present work the salt ability to remove sodium and calcium was tested both laboratory and full-scale (industrial scale). Laboratory scale batch experiments were performed with 2 kg?s of an Al-Mg alloy, and salt was added {{to the top of the}} melt. The use of salt doubled the rate constant for sodium removal from the melt compared too without salt. Calcium was not removed without the presence of salt. The lowest Na and Ca values achieved were 0, 2 and 0, 1 ppm respectively. In the full-scale test conducted at Alcoa Mosj&# 248;en, the effect of stirring time and salt amounts was studied. The removal of Na and Ca were shown to follow first order reaction kinetics. The removal constants were calculated and compared to salt amounts, temperature and magnesium concentration in the melt. Temperature and Mg concentration did not show to have an impact on the removal rates in the intervals tested. The rate constant for Na removal showed to be linear to the salt amounts in the region tested. The overall amounts of Ca in the melt was low, which resulted in the small amount removed gave large outcomes on the removal constants. By estimating the need for removal of Na, the amount of salt and the stirring time needed can be calculated. By increasing the stirring time the additions of salt needed is lowered, and salt charges will with time be less. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT [...] - Boron nitride is an {{advanced}} ceramic material that shows outstanding lubricating and release properties when used at high temperature {{in contact with}} aluminum and its alloys.

These coatings are proven release agents in the <b>casthouse</b> for coating thimbles, transition plates and refractory linings of distribution troughs of DC casting machines. During cast breaks they ensure an easy release of the remaining aluminum without damaging the refractory lining. In contrast to coatings used so far (based on graphite, silicates and similar substances) boron nitride release coatings are stable in air up to 1000 °C (1832 °F), show excellent non-wetting behavior (the best in the field of ceramics) and very good lubrication properties even at high temperatures.

40|$|Abstract. Hycast TM RAM, {{hereafter}} called RAM, is a crucible fluxing {{technology for}} removal of alkaline elements (Na, Ca, and Li), {{as well as}} carbides, oxides and cryolite, from aluminium pot-room metal {{without the use of}} chlorine. AlF 3 powder is injected into the liquid metal (below the metal surface) by the use of a specially designed rotor system and argon as a carrier gas. The fluxing system can be adapted to different crucible transport/tapping system, and is proven for crucible sizes from 2 to 9 tons. Since surface active elements like Sodium are removed before the metal enters into the furnace, the metal oxidation during pouring and furnace treatment is significantly reduced. Pretreatment will also reduce the carbide level in the metal, and by this improve the overall metal quality, and prevent clogging/deposits in furnaces, degassers, ceramic foam filters etc. This paper describes the principles of the RAM technology, effect on metal quality and documented operational benefits in a primary <b>casthouse.</b> Also environmental issues are discussed...|$|E

The study demonstrates that: The effectively separation of iron and slag, naturally pulverization of the slag phase, and good surface quality of bigger, glosser and brighter iron nuggets can be obtained with reduction temperature 1400 ˚C,C/O molar ratio 1. 1,as well as basicity above 1. 8 in this process; The iron phase is not generated well and proportion of small size iron nuggets increases when C/O molar ratio is increased; With C/O molar ratio increases or temperature rises, CO generated increases in direct reduction, which strengthen the reducibility atmosphere in the pellets, beneficial to the processing of desulfuration and dephosphorization; Rising temperature accelerates the generation of molten iron, so that, the fixed carbon contacts with the molten iron longer, which increasing the carbon in iron nuggets.

40|$|Recent work {{developed}} {{a model that}} predicts relative grain size changes due to the addition of nucleant particles and solute. The model predicts that when potent nucleant particles such as TiB(2) are present then the gain size is inversely proportional to solute content {{as defined by the}} growth restriction factor, Q. The predictions of the model have been confirmed by grain size data for seven wrought alloys. The results also indicate that there is a minimum grain size that can be achieved by the addition of solute. A further result arising from this work is the role of impurity boron in affecting the performance of grain refiners. At low solute titanium levels impurity boron can remain in excess after consuming the titanium as TiB(2). This excess appears to form less stable borides that decrease the potency of the nucleant particles. Once the amount of added titanium exceeds that required to consume all of the boron, the particles become effective refiners again. The implications of this research for <b>casthouse</b> practice and the possible effect of casting conditions on the validity of the model are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Control of {{impurity}} {{elements in}} Al-based alloys is of increasing technological importance, both in {{primary and secondary}} alloy production. In primary alloy production, Ni and V concentrations in the coke are rising and this is increasing the level of impurities in the final products {{to the extent that}} they are out of specification. Impurity control is also of concern in recycling due to the pickup of elements such as Fe from contaminants in the scrap, which can detrimentally affect the alloy properties. Dissolved elemental impurities can be removed by a number of different processes including boron treatment for some of the transition metals. Other processes in the cast shop for removing impurities and inclusions from Al melts include fluxing, floatation, and filtration. Gas purging, vacuum treatment, filtration, the use of salts, and combinations of these presently find commercial applications. Ultra purity Al and its alloys can be obtained using zone refining and three-layer electrolysis methods. The demand for higher purity Al has been largely met by additional electrolytic refining processes.

40|$|Smelter-grade {{aluminum}} {{cannot be}} used for electrical conductor applications without the removal of transition metal impurities including zirconium (Zr) and vanadium (V). These impurities are removed by treating molten aluminum with boron bearing substances in the <b>casthouse.</b> Such procedures are called boron treatment. Transition metal impurities form their borides and settle at bottom of the furnace. Industrially, Al-B (AlB 2 /AlB 12) master alloys are used for this process. Literature review showed that ZrB 2 are more stable compared to VB 2 and AlB 2 in the temperatures ranging from 948 K to 1173 K (675 °C to 900 °C). As a result, ZrB 2 will form preferentially in molten aluminum during boron treatment process. In this study, a systematic investigation on formation of the ZrB 2 and VB 2 borides in Al-V-Zr-B alloys was carried out at 1023 K (750 °C). Experiments showed that the mechanism of ZrB 2 and VB 2 borides formation in molten aluminum is complex. It involves the possible phenomenon of chemical reactions, mass transfer in liquid phase, diffusion through borides layers, and the dissolution of Al 3 Zr, AlB 2 /AlB 12 in the molten aluminum. Scanning electron microscopy, Energy-dispersive X-ray, and electron backscattered diffraction analyses revealed the preferential formation of ZrB 2 in the Al-Zr-V-B alloys at 1023 K (750 °C). Moreover, ICP-AES analysis showed the higher rate of Zr removal compared to V from Al-Zr-V-B alloys. Overall {{it was suggested that}} the kinetics of Zr removal was controlled by the mass transfer of Zr through liquid phase. The calculated mass transfer coefficient (km) for Zr was 1. 15 × 10 − 3 m/s which is within the range of those values reported in the literature...|$|E

40|$|Smelter grade {{aluminium}} {{can be used}} as {{a source}} for electrical conductor grade aluminium after the transition metal impurities such as zirconium (Zr), vanadium (V), titanium (Ti) and chromium (Cr) have been removed. Zirconium (Zr), in particular, has a significant effect on the electrical conductivity of aluminium. In practice, the transition metal impurities are removed by adding boron-containing substances into the melt in the <b>casthouse.</b> This step is called boron treatment. The work presented in this paper, which focuses on the thermodynamics and kinetics of Zr removal from molten Al&# 8211; 1 &# 8197;wt-%Zr&# 8211; 0. 23 &# 8197;wt-%B alloy, is part of a broader systematic study on the removal of V, Ti, Cr and Zr from Al melt through boron treatment carried out by the authors. The thermodynamic analyses of Zr removal through the formation of ZrB 2 were carried out in the temperature range of 675 &# 8211; 900 &# 0176;C using the thermochemical package FactSage. It was predicted that ZrB 2 is stable compared to Al&# 8211;borides (AlB 12, AlB 2) hence would form during boron treatment of molten Al&# 8211;Zr&# 8211;B alloys. Al&# 8211;Zr&# 8211;B alloys were reacted at 750 &# 8201;&# 0177;&# 8201; 10 &# 0176;C for 60 minutes, and the change in the chemistry and microstructure were tracked and analysed at particular reaction times. The results showed that the reaction between Zr and AlB 12 /B was fast as revealed by the formation of boride ring at the early minutes of reaction. The presence of black phase (AlB 12), i. e. the original source of B, after holding the melt for 60 minutes advocated that the reaction between Zr and AlB 12 /B was incomplete, hence still not reached the equilibrium state. The kinetics data suggested a higher reaction rate at the early minutes (2 minutes) of reaction compared to at a later stage (2 &# 8211; 60 minutes). Nevertheless, a simple single-stage liquid mass transfer controlled kinetic model can be used to describe the overall process kinetic. The analysis of integrated rate law versus reaction time revealed that the mass transfer coefficient (km) of Zr in molten alloy is 9. 5 &# 8201;&# 0215;&# 8201; 10 &# 8722; 4 &# 8197;m&# 8197;s&# 8722; 1, which is within a typical range (10 &# 8722; 3 to 10 &# 8722; 4 &# 8197;m&# 8197;s&# 8722; 1) observed in other metallurgical solid&# 8211;liquid reactions.

40|$|The {{combination}} of a hot fluid (e. g., molten metals) and a cold vaporizing fluid (e. g., water) can undergo spontaneous or externally assisted explosive interactions. Such explosions are a well-established contributor to the risk for nuclear reactors exemplified by the infamous Chernobyl accident. Once fundamentals are understood, {{it may be possible}} to not only prevent but also, more importantly, control the intensity for useful applications in the areas covering variable thrust propulsion with tailored pressure profiles, for enhancing rapid heat transfer, and also for powder metallurgy (i. e., supercooled powder production, wherein materials turn superplastic with enhanced ductility). This thesis report discusses results of experiments conducted with various molten metals, specifically, tin, gallium, Galinstan, and aluminum interacting with water (with and without salt), and with and without noncondensable gases such as hydrogen or air. It is found that under the appropriate conditions, spontaneous and energetic phase changes can be initiated within milliseconds if the hot metal is tin or Galinstan, including the timed feedback of shocks leading to chain-type reactions. Using 3 – 10 g of tin or Galinstan, shock pressures up to 25 bars (350 psig) and mechanical power over ∼ 2 – 4 kW were monitored about 4 cm from the explosion zone. The interaction could be intensified more than ten folds by dropping the melt through an argon atmosphere. A slow metal quenching interaction occurring over tens of seconds could be turned explosive to transpire within milliseconds if the thermal states are within the so-called thermal interaction zone. Such explosive interactions did not transpire with gallium or aluminum due to tough oxide coatings. However, by adding ∼ 10 w/o of salt in water, molten Gallium readily exploded. Similar additions 2. 5 – 10 w/o of salt in the tin-water system revealed enhancements in the interfacial film heat transfer dynamics, subsequently leading to enhanced melt triggerability. Further studies on triggering enhancement were conducted using underwater detonations to artificially generate shock-like pressure traces. It was found that these pressure transients initiated film collapse in the otherwise thermally stabilized systems, leading to explosive interactions superior in nature to the best-case spontaneous explosions. It was also conclusively revealed that, for an otherwise spontaneously explosive interaction of tin-water or Galinstan-water, the inclusion of trace (0. 3 w/o) quantities of aluminum has a radical influence on stabilizing the system and ensuring conclusive prevention of explosion triggering. However, inclusion of external trigger shocks readily initiated explosive interactions, rapidly reducing the original melt to micron-scale fragments and producing preliminary evidence that vapor explosions may act to mechanically catalyze the Al-water reaction. This thesis report compares and presents the results obtained in this study and draws analogies with industrial scale aluminum <b>casthouse</b> safety involving thousands of kilograms of melt. Insights are provided for enabling physics-based prevention, or, alternately, the intentional initiation of explosions with combined simultaneous chemical and thermo-mechanical energetic bursts and impulse hydrogen production. Finally, recommendations are provided for future studies impacting fields as diverse as nanoscale powder metallurgy, insensitive high energy density materials, impulse hydrogen production, supercooling, and nuclear and metals casting industrial safety. ...|$|E
