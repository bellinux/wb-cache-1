5|$|In February–March 2007 New Horizons {{spacecraft}} {{conducted a}} deep {{search for new}} small moons inside the main ring. While no satellites larger than 0.5km were found, the cameras of the spacecraft detected seven small <b>clumps</b> of ring particles. They orbit just inside the orbit of Adrastea inside a dense ringlet. The conclusion, that they are <b>clumps</b> and not small moons, is based on their azimuthally extended appearance. They subtend 0.1–0.3° along the ring, which correspond to 1000–3000km. The <b>clumps</b> are {{divided into two groups}} of five and two members, respectively. The nature of the <b>clumps</b> is not clear, but their orbits are close to 115:116 and 114:115 resonances with Metis. They may be wavelike structures excited by this interaction.|$|E

40|$|Encapsulated and nonencapsulated {{strains of}} Staphylococcus aureus which lack coagulase or <b>clumping</b> factor (bound coagulase), or both, were {{examined}} for the antigen {{associated with the}} fibrinogen-cell <b>clumping</b> reaction. Extracts of the cells were {{tested for the ability}} to react with fibrinogen or to inhibit fibrinogen precipitation. Antisera prepared against encapsulated (coagulase-positive, <b>clumping</b> factor-negative) variants, as well as against nonencapsulated wild-type (coagulase-positive, <b>clumping</b> factor-positive) S. aureus strains, contained high titers of clumping-inhibiting antibody. When coagulase-negative, <b>clumping</b> factor-negative mutants were the immunizing agents, antisera contained no demonstrable clumping-inhibiting antibody. Phenol extracts of all coagulase-positive strains tested precipitated fibrinogen, regardless of the ability of cells to <b>clump</b> in the presence of fibrinogen. Polysaccharide extracts of encapsulated, <b>clumping</b> factor-negative strains inhibited this fibrinogen-precipitating activity, whereas similar extracts of nonencapsulated staphylococci did not inhibit the fibrinogen reaction. From these results, it appeared that the coagulase-positive, encapsulated staphylococci which do not <b>clump</b> in fibrinogen solution possess <b>clumping</b> factor, but that their capsular polysaccharide inhibits <b>clumping</b> activity. These findings suggested a closer association of <b>clumping</b> factor and coagulase than is now recognized...|$|R
40|$|Platelet-mediated <b>clumping</b> of Plasmodium falciparum -infected {{erythrocytes}} (IEs) is {{a common}} property of field isolates associated with severe disease (Pain, Ferguson et al. 2001). Platelet receptors CD 36 (Pain, Ferguson et al. 2001), P-Selectin (Wassmer, Taylor et al. 2008) and gC 1 qR (Biswas, Hafiz et al. 2007) mediate <b>clumping.</b> To characterize the molecular specificities of the <b>clumping</b> phenotype, I cloned <b>clumping</b> parasite line IT/C 10 by limiting dilution. I characterized var gene expression in the IT/C 10 clones using generic primers for the DBL tag region (Bull, Berriman et al. 2005). <b>Clumping</b> assays were conducted {{in the presence of}} specific reagents to delineate host factors hypothesized to contribute to development of the <b>clumping</b> phenotype. Finally, I conducted a clinical study with isolates from children with malaria in Kilifi, Kenya. This study shows that in parasite line IT/C 10, platelet-mediated <b>clumping</b> is associated with Itvar 30 suggesting a prominent role for the PfEMP- 1 encoded by this var gene in development of platelet-mediated <b>clumping.</b> For IT/C 10 parasites, platelet activation appears to be involved in platelet-mediated <b>clumping.</b> Platelet P-Selectin appears to mediate <b>clumping</b> using lectin-dependent interactions. To further elucidate the mechanisms that mediate <b>clumping</b> by host platelets, I have used a panel of platelet antagonists to delineate specific platelet activation pathways. Our results show that platelet activation {{plays an important role in}} platelet-mediated <b>clumping.</b> Finally, in this study, platelet-mediated <b>clumping</b> was associated with parasitaemia, but not with disease severity.

40|$|<b>Clumping</b> in stellar {{winds of}} hot stars is a {{possible}} consequence of radiative-acoustic instability appearing in solutions of radiative-hydrodynamical equations. However, <b>clumping</b> is usually included to stellar atmosphere modeling and radiative transfer calculations in a highly approximate way via a global free parameter called the <b>clumping</b> factor. Using different values of <b>clumping</b> factors many researchers succeeded to fit the observed spectra better and to correct empirical mass loss rates. This usually leads to a conclusion that the stellar wind is <b>clumped.</b> To understand how <b>clumping</b> may influence theoretical predictions of mass-loss rates, different <b>clumping</b> properties {{have to be taken}} into account.

5|$|A Japanese {{field study}} found that S.spraguei was the {{dominant}} fungus in a 21-year-old stand of Korean Pine, {{both in terms of}} ectomycorrhizae (measured as percentage of biomass present in soil samples) and by fruit body production (comprising over 90% of dry weight of total fruit bodies collected of all species). The production of S.spraguei fruit bodies averaged about one per square meter, without much variance during the four-year study period. The mushrooms appeared mostly from August to November, tended to grow in <b>clumps,</b> and the spatial distribution of <b>clumps</b> was random—the location of the <b>clumps</b> was not correlatable with appearances in previous years. The density of mushrooms along a forest road was higher than average, suggesting a preference for disturbed habitat. The results also suggested that S.spraguei prefers to produce fruit bodies in areas with low litter accumulation, a finding corroborated in a later publication. This study also determined that the fungus propagates mainly by vegetative growth (extension of underground mycelia), rather than by colonization of spores.|$|E

40|$|Platelet-mediated <b>clumping</b> of Plasmodium falciparum {{infected}} erythrocytes (IEs) is a frequently observed parasite adhesion phenotype. The {{importance of}} <b>clumping</b> in severe malaria and the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon are incompletely understood. Three platelet surface molecules have previously {{been identified as}} <b>clumping</b> receptors: CD 36, globular C 1 q receptor (gC 1 qR/HABP 1 /p 32), and P-selectin (CD 62 P), but the parasite ligands mediating this phenotype are unknown. The aim of this work {{was to develop a}} selection method to facilitate investigations of the molecular mechanisms of <b>clumping</b> in selected P. falciparum lines. Magnetic beads coated with anti-platelet antibodies were used to positively and negatively select <b>clumping</b> IEs from P. falciparum strains IT, HB 3, 3 D 7 and Dd 2. <b>Clumping</b> in all four positively selected parasite lines was abolished by antibodies to CD 36, but was not affected by antibodies to gC 1 qR or P-selectin. <b>Clumping</b> positive lines showed significantly higher binding to CD 36 than <b>clumping</b> negative lines in flow adhesion assays (strains IT, HB 3 and 3 D 7, p, 0. 05 for all strains, paired t test) and static assays (strain Dd 2, p, 0. 0001 paired t test). However, <b>clumping</b> negative lines IT, HB 3 and 3 D 7 did show some binding to CD 36 under flow conditions, indicating that CD 36 -binding is not sufficient for <b>clumping.</b> These data show that CD 36 -dependent <b>clumping</b> positive and negative lines can easily be selected from P. falciparum laboratory strains. CD 36 -binding is necessary but not sufficient for <b>clumping,</b> and the molecular differences between <b>clumping</b> positive and negative parasite lines responsible for the phenotype require furthe...|$|R

40|$|We {{identify}} a vertical {{extension of the}} red <b>clump</b> stars in the color magnitude diagram (CMD) of {{a section of the}} Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The distribution of stars in this extension is indistinguishable in the U, B, V, and I bands — confirming that the detection is real and placing a strong constraint on models of this stellar population. After subtracting the principal red <b>clump</b> component, we find a peak in the residual stellar distribution that is ∼ 0. 9 mag brighter than the peak of the principal red <b>clump</b> distribution. We consider and reject the following possible explanations for this population: inhomogeneous reddening, Galactic disk stars, random blends of red <b>clump</b> stars, correlated blends of red <b>clump</b> stars (binaries), evolution of the red <b>clump</b> stars, and red <b>clump</b> stars from a younger LMC stellar population. Combinations of these effects cannot be ruled out as the origin of this stellar population.

5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form {{in massive}} and dense clouds of {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC).

5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease has}} been {{identified}} as a protein misfolding disease (proteopathy), caused by plaque accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta protein, and tau protein in the brain. Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43amino acids in length, called amyloid beta (Aβ). Aβ is a fragment from the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival, and post-injury repair. In Alzheimer's disease, gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a proteolytic process which causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of amyloid beta, which then form <b>clumps</b> that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques.|$|E

A 28 -year-old water oak (Quercus nigra L.) plantation was thinned from below to either 254 or 462 stems per hectare to determine the influence of a partial canopy on oak stump sprout development.

Within-clump sprout mortality was not influenced by overstory thinning level, but by year 2 height and diameter increment were 15 % and 22 % greater, respectively, under the heavy overstory removal. Positive height and diameter growth of dominant sprouts continued under both canopy conditions through year 7, but early benefits of the heavy overstory removal on sprout growth diminished.
