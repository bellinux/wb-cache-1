Importantly, it is involved along with <b>Ctrl</b> and <b>Shift</b> keys in keyboard shortcuts for copy (Ctrl+Insert) and paste (Shift+Insert) {{according to the}} IBM CUA user interface guidelines; the IBM CUA shortcuts are still widely supported by most current PC operating systems, and many PC users who learned those shortcuts between the late 1980s and the early 1990s may still find them more natural, convenient, or ergonomic than their [...] "modern" [...] Ctrl+X/C/V counterparts, given the close proximity of the <b>Ctrl,</b> <b>Shift</b> and Insert keys to the cursor movement keys. This particular role of the Insert key is often overlooked by modern-times documentation, if not hardware design, which tend to attribute to [...] "Insert" [...] only its more obvious, but much less frequently used and somewhat obsolete, original function.|$|R

5000|$|For {{the user}} to get {{the benefit of the}} full n-key rollover, the {{complete}} key press status must be transmitted to the computer. When the data is sent via the USB protocol, there are two operating modes: Human Interface Device (HID) [...] "report protocol" [...] and [...] "boot protocol". The boot protocol, which is enabled on boot, is limited to 8 modifier keys (left and right versions of <b>Ctrl,</b> <b>Shift,</b> Alt, and Win), followed by maximum 6 key codes. This will limit the amount of simultaneous key presses that can be reported. To get full n-key rollover, HID report protocol must be implemented on both keyboard and computer.|$|R
50|$|Fn is a {{modifier}} key, {{and works}} like other modifiers keys, such as <b>Ctrl,</b> <b>Shift</b> and AltGr. For a standard modifier key, the microcontroller inside the keyboard sends a scancode for the modifier itself, {{which is then}} interpreted by the operating system and combined with other simultaneous key-presses. The Fn key {{is a form of}} meta-modifier key, in that it causes the operating system to see altered scancodes when other keys on the keyboard are pressed. This allows the keyboard to directly emulate a full-sized keyboard, so the operating system can use standard keymaps designed for a full-sized keyboard. However, because the operating system has no notion of the Fn key, the key can not normally be remapped in software, unlike all other standard keyboard keys.|$|R
50|$|Opera {{allows the}} user to {{retrieve}} all of the tabs or windows closed earlier in the current session from a list. Closed tabs can be recovered in the reverse sequence {{in which they were}} closed, by default this is achieved via the keyboard shortcut <b>Ctrl</b> + <b>Shift</b> + T.|$|R
5000|$|Numeric input: Numeric buttons can be [...] "dragged" [...] {{to change}} their value {{directly}} without the need to aim at a particular widget, {{as well as being}} set using the keyboard. Both sliders and number buttons can be constrained to various step sizes with modifiers like the <b>Ctrl</b> and <b>Shift</b> keys. Python expressions can also be typed directly into number entry fields, allowing mathematical expressions to specify values.|$|R
30|$|Each nurse {{can work}} at most two {{consecutive}} long <b>shifts</b> (<b>shift</b> <b>L).</b> This constraint {{should be considered}} in assigning shifts to the nurses on the first 2  days of the planning horizon by considering the schedule of nurses on the last 2  days of the previous planning horizon.|$|R
50|$|Bucky bits {{were used}} heavily on {{keyboards}} designed by Tom Knight in MIT, including space-cadet keyboards used on LISP machines. These could contain as many modifier keys as: <b>SHIFT,</b> <b>CTRL,</b> META, HYPER, SUPER, TOP, FRONT, and GREEK.|$|R
50|$|Rhotacism, in Romanesco, <b>shifts</b> <b>l</b> to r {{before a}} consonant, like certain Andalusian dialects of Spanish. Thus, Latin altus (tall) is alto in Italian but becomes arto in Romanesco. Rhotacism used {{to happen when}} l was preceded by a consonant, as in the word ingrese (English), but modern speech has lost that characteristic.|$|R

40|$|We {{observe the}} {{frequency}} <b>shift,</b> <b>l</b> Omega, imparted to a mm-wave beam with an {{orbital angular momentum}} of l (h) over bar per photon, when the beam,is rotated at angular frequency Omega. We show that this shift, and those found {{in a number of}} experiments on the rotation of circularly polarized beams, are special cases of the rotational frequency shift recently predicted by Bialynicki-Birula and Bialynicka-Birula. The measurement also explicitly confirms a theoretical prediction by Nienhuis...|$|R
25|$|In GNU/Linux, under recent {{versions}} of GTK+, {{there are various}} methods of producing these dashes. For em dashes, one may use the compose key followed by three presses of the hyphen character. For en dashes, one may press the compose key followed by two hyphens and a period. For all dashes, one may press and hold <b>ctrl</b> and <b>shift</b> and then press u (and release them all) after which an underlined u appears. Then, type the Unicode number (i.e., 2015) for the appropriate dash and press enter or the space bar. Also, other keys may be remapped to create dashes.|$|R
50|$|Nota Bene has a {{large number}} of {{built-in}} keyboard shortcuts. Most commands can be entered in several ways, using a mouse, menus, toolbars, the command line, or keystroke combinations. The keyboard is fully customizable: users can modify virtually all alphanumeric and function keys, using the <b>Ctrl,</b> Alt, and <b>Shift</b> modifiers in over 450 key combinations.|$|R
5000|$|Sticky keys allows {{characters}} or {{commands to}} be typed {{without having to}} hold down a modifier key (<b>Shift,</b> <b>Ctrl,</b> Alt) while pressing a second key. Similarly, ClickLock is a Microsoft Windows feature that remembers a mouse button is down so that items can be highlighted or dragged without holding the mouse button down while scrolling.|$|R
5000|$|A key may {{function}} as a dead key by default, and many non-English keyboard layouts in particular have dead keys directly on the keyboard. The basic US keyboard {{does not have any}} dead keys, but the US-International keyboard layout, available on Windows and the X Window System, places some dead keys directly on similar-looking punctuation marks. Old computer systems, such as the MSX, often had a special key labeled dead key, which in combination with the <b>Ctrl</b> and <b>Shift</b> keys could be used to add some of the diacritics commonly needed in the Western European languages ( [...] , , [...] and [...] ) to vowels that were typed subsequently.|$|R

25|$|A {{keyboard}} is {{the device}} {{most commonly used}} for writing via computer. Each key {{is associated with a}} standard code which the keyboard sends to the computer when it is pressed. By using a combination of alphabetic keys with modifier keys such as <b>Ctrl,</b> Alt, <b>Shift</b> and AltGr, various character codes are generated and sent to the CPU. The operating system intercepts and converts those signals to the appropriate characters based on the keyboard layout and input method, and then delivers those converted codes and characters to the running application software, which in turn looks up the appropriate glyph in the currently used font file, and requests the operating system to draw these on the screen.|$|R
30|$|Operating a {{computer}} requires keyboard functionality {{that is beyond}} plain text entry. OnScreenDualScribe provides several ways to use special keys, like <b>SHIFT,</b> <b>CTRL,</b> or ALT. An example is single keystroke mode. In this mode, a single keystroke directly triggers a virtual keystroke (as opposed to dual mode). It gives access to frequently used keys, like the regular arrow keys, ESCAPE, DELETE, or PASTE (Figures 5 a and 5 b).|$|R
50|$|Sticky keys is an {{accessibility}} {{feature of}} some {{graphical user interfaces}} to assist users who have physical disabilities or help users reduce repetitive strain injury (or a syndrome called the Emacs Pinky).
