5|$|Many {{national}} and <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds</b> denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|E

In fact, the decompositions of aggregate bond volatility have a higher contemporaneous correlation with bond yields in comparison to idiosyncratic stock risk.

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} the proxy, volatility-restriction (VR) and maximum likelihood (ML) approaches to implementing structural <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> pricing models, and documents that ML estimation {{is the best}} among the three implementation methods. Empirical studies using either the proxy approach or the VR method conclude that barrier-independent models significantly underestimate <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> yields. Although barrier-dependent models tend to overestimate the yield on average, they generate a sizable degree of underestimation. The present paper shows that the proxy approach is an upwardly biased estimator of the corporate assets and makes the empirical framework work systematically against structural models of <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> pricing. The VR approach may generate inconsistent <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> prices or may fail to give a positive <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> price for some structural models. When the Merton, LS, BD and LT models are implemented with ML estimation, we find substantial improvement in their performances. Our empirical analysis shows that the LT model is very accurate for predicting short-term bond yields, whereas the LS and BD models are good predictors for medium-term and long-term bonds. The Merton model however significantly overestimates short-term bond yields and underestimates long-term bond yields. Unlike empirical studies in the past, the Merton model implemented with ML estimation does not consistently underestimate <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> yields. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Since {{the early}} 2000 s the Swedish <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> market has {{experienced}} a significant growth. This study does, through a quantitative method, research and discuss the factors that are the main drivers {{of growth in the}} Swedish <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> market and how they are related. The study focuses on the development since 2007, as the prior available data is limited. Initially, a literature review indicated that the Swedish central bank rate and the Basel Accords were the main drivers of growth. These two factors were therefore chosen as independent variables and were tested against the dependent variable, issued amount of bonds in SEK, in a number of regression analyses. The study's two propositions were; the central bank rate is a main driver for the growth in the Swedish <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> market, and the Basel Accords are main drivers for the growth in the Swedish <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> market. The first proposition, that the central bank rate is a main driver for the growth in the Swedish <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> market, was rejected as no significance in the regression analyses could be seen. The second proposition, that the Basel accords are main drivers of growth in the Swedish <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> market, was supported as significance between the issuance of bonds and the Basel variables (with time lags) could be seen in the regression analyses. As the study found support for this proposition it indicates that regulations have triggered a market development. Thus the Basel accords seem to have triggered growth in the Swedish <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> market...|$|R
