25|$|GUIs were a {{hot topic}} in the early 1980s. The Apple Lisa was {{released}} in 1983, and various windowing systems existed for DOS operating systems (including PC GEM and PC/GEOS). Individual applications for many platforms presented their own GUI variants. Despite the GUIs advantages, many reviewers questioned {{the value of the}} entire concept, citing hardware limits, and problems in finding <b>compatible</b> <b>software.</b>|$|E

25|$|After {{it became}} clear that it had been a mistake to ignore the issue of PC compatibility, Wang belatedly {{released}} an emulation board for Wang PC that enabled operation of many PC <b>compatible</b> <b>software</b> packages. The board accomplished this by monitoring all I/O and memory transactions (visible in those days before North/South bridge chips to any board plugged into a slot on the expansion bus) and generating a non-maskable interrupt (NMI) whenever an operation was deemed to involve an incompatible device, requiring emulation.|$|E
25|$|For example: the floppy {{controller}} circuitry on the Wang PC {{was similar}} to that of the IBM PC but involved enough design differences that PC <b>compatible</b> <b>software</b> attempting to manipulate it directly would fail. Wang's PC emulation hardware would detect I/O and memory operations involving the addresses associated with the floppy controller in the IBM PC and generate an NMI. The NMI handler would immediately be activated (the exception vector having been appropriated during system init to point to ROM routines on the emulation board instead of the NMI routine in the PC BIOS) and would then update an internal representation of the IBM PC floppy controller and manipulate the real controller to reflect its state. Reads were satisfied in a similar way, by forcing an NMI, decoding the machine code indicated by the Instruction Pointer at the time of the fault, and then obtaining the desired info and updating the CPU registers accordingly before resuming the executing program.|$|E
500|$|Among the {{influences}} of the verdict include Sega v. Accolades effect on the criteria for fair use and the responsibilities of trademark holders in legal examinations. [...] Although Accolade had copied entire Genesis games {{in order to identify}} the TMSS, the court gave little weight to the criterion on the amount of the copyrighted work being copied, {{in light of the fact}} that Accolade had done so in order to create their own <b>compatible</b> <b>software.</b> [...] Likewise, the nature of the work was also given less weight, essentially establishing a two-factor approach to evaluating fair use in the purpose of use and impact on the market. [...] It was also the first time that the Lanham Act was interpreted to mean that confusion resulting from the placement of one's trademark on another work by means of a security program is the fault of the original registrant of the trademark.|$|E

50|$|The Sound Blaster 16 {{retained}} the Pro's OPL-3 support for FM synthesis, and was mostly <b>compatible</b> with <b>software</b> {{written for the}} older Sound Blaster and Sound Blaster Pro sound cards. The SB16's MPU-401 emulation was limited to UART (dumb) mode only, but this was sufficient for most MIDI software. When a daughterboard, such as the Wave Blaster, Roland SCB-7, Roland SCB-55, Yamaha DB50XG, Yamaha DB60XG was installed on the Sound Blaster, the Wave Blaster behaved like a standard MIDI device, accessible to any MPU-401 <b>compatible</b> MIDI <b>software.</b>|$|R
