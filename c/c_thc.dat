I'revious work on this alloy has shown the material to have higher strengths at room and elevated temperatures when compared with other gamma titanium aluminides. In particular, this new alloy has shown increased ductility at elevated temperatures under both quasi-static and high strain rate uniaxial compressive loading.

Total haemocyte count (THC), haemocyte diameter and volume, haemocyte proliferation, cell-free haemolymph (CFH) glucose and total protein levels, and phenoloxidase (PO) activity in both haemocyte lysate (HL) and CFH were measured in crabs.

This specificity of the C 3 d receptor allowed certain cells which contained only C 3 d receptors to form rosettes with EAC 1 - 3 b and EAC 1 - 3 d, but not with EAC 14. However, because C 3 d receptors bound EAC 1 - 3 d or C 3 d fragments more firmly than they did EAC 1 - 3 b or C 3 b fragments, many other types of cells containing only C 3 d receptors, formed rosettes with EAC 1 - 3 d but not with EAC 1 - 3 b.

This assay involved fluorescence labeling of one of the two C receptors with soluble C fragments in combination with the usual rosette method for labeling the other type of C receptor.

Hybridization is an effective way of genetic improvement in aquaculture, which can introduce improved traits to the hybrids. In this study, we challenged the hybrids between Haliotis discus hannai and Haliotis gigantea, and their parents with bacteria (vibrio harveyi, vibrio alginolyticus and vibrio parahemolyticus), then held them at 20 degrees C and 28 degrees C, survival rates of the parental populations and hybrid populations were recorded. Then we tested the immune responses and thermal-induced responses of the four populations at different temperatures. Total hemocyte count (THC), respiratory burst, superoxide dismutase activity (SOD), acid phosphatase activity (ACP), alkaline phosphatase activity (AKP), myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), and HSP 70 expression were determined on day 1 and day 7 of the temperature exposure. Results showed higher survival rates of the hybrids than their parents against bacteria challenge. For immune parameters, THCs were evaluated at 28 degrees <b>C,</b> while increased <b>THC</b> was also observed in H. discus hannai female x H. gigantea male (DG) and H. discus hannai female x H. discus hannai male (DD) at 12 degrees C (day 7); at 28 degrees C, respiratory burst was activated (day 1 and 7), while SOD activity first rose then fell over 7 -days exposure; AKP activity was elevated at 12 degrees C and 28 degrees C (day 1), most notably in DG, and an increased level of ACP was observed in DG at 28 degrees C (day 7); MPO activity was suppressed at 12 degrees C and 28 degrees C on day 1, but recovered on day 7. For HSP 70, increased HSP 70 levels were observed in all populations at 28 degrees C (day 1), and DD got the lowest HSP 70 level after 7 -days exposure at 28 degrees C. Overall, the results suggest that temperature changes could significantly affect the physiological status of abalone, and hybrids may be more resistant to disease and thermal stresses than their parents.

40|$|Ag/Al 2 O 3 是催化碳氢化合物选择性还原NOx 反应最具催化活性的材料之一，但缺点是在其选择性催化还原NOx 的过程中会产生大量副产物CO。目前，解决该问题最现实的方法是使用氧化催化剂对Ag/Al 2 O 3 选择性催化还原NOx 反应的尾气进行后处理。研究表明，该氧化催化剂必须具备适中的氧化活性才能达到既消除副产物，又不影响Ag/Al 2 O 3 选择性催化还原NOx 活性的目的。 本论文首先通过对一系列催化剂样品的活性评价，发现Cu/Al 2 O 3 具有适中的氧化活性，因此我们选用Cu/Al 2 O 3 与Ag/Al 2 O 3 联用来消除副产物。以不同方式将Ag/Al 2 O 3 和Cu/Al 2 O 3 组成复合催化剂，并对其选择性催化还原NOx 和消除副产物的活性进行了考察，发现将Cu/Al 2 O 3 加在Ag/Al 2 O 3 后组成的复合催化剂最佳。该复合催化剂既能保持与Ag/Al 2 O 3 相当的催化丙烯、乙醇选择性还原NOx 活性，也能够有效消除Ag/Al 2 O 3 选择性催化还原NOx 反应过程中产生的副产物CO，同时还能够大大降低乙醇为还原剂时尾气中未燃乙醇和乙醛的浓度。制备了Ag/Al 2 O 3 和Cu/Al 2 O 3 整体催化剂，并进行了实际操作条件下的柴油机台架实验。结果表明，Ag/Al 2 O 3 整体催化剂具有较高的去除柴油机尾气中NOx的能力，但在高效利用乙醇还原柴油机尾气中NOx 的同时，也会生成大量副产物CO，而且添加乙醇也会导致THC 排放的大幅增加。通过使用Ag + Cu 复合整体催化剂―乙醇组合体系，并对乙醇添加策略进行优化后，在欧III 标准的十三工况条件下，柴油车尾气排放的NOx、THC 和CO 排放都满足了欧III 排放标准。 本论文同时对室温催化氧化甲醛进行了研究。首先对Cu/Al 2 O 3 室温催化氧化甲醛进行了考察，发现在室温条件下Cu/Al 2 O 3 并没有催化完全氧化甲醛的活性，但仍具有很强的去除甲醛的能力。TPD、原位红外实验以及理论计算研究证实，吸附在Cu/Al 2 O 3 上的甲醛会完全被氧化为表面甲酸盐物种，当Cu/Al 2 O 3 完全被甲酸盐物种所覆盖后，将失去去除甲醛的能力。通过程序升温脱附过程对失活催化剂进行处理，表面甲酸盐物种将分解为无害的CO 2 和H 2 O 从催化剂表面脱附出来，同时Cu/Al 2 O 3 获得再生而可以重新利用。另外，尽管负载金属Cu 对载体Al 2 O 3 的去除甲醛能力并没有明显的促进作用，但却能大大降低吸附物种在载体Al 2 O 3 上的分解脱附温度。 在上述研究的基础上，成功的开发出具有极佳催化完全氧化甲醛反应活性的Pt/TiO 2 催化剂。该催化剂室温下就能完全催化氧化甲醛为无害的H 2 O 和CO 2 。XRD 和HR TEM 表征结果表明，贵金属Pt 在载体TiO 2 获得了超高分散，Pt 的粒径低于 1 nm，这是Pt/TiO 2 具有极佳催化完全氧化HCHO反应活性的重要原因。通过原位红外实验发现，甲酸盐吸附物种和CO 吸附物种是室温下Pt/TiO 2 催化完全氧化甲醛反应过程中两个重要的中间体，而且甲酸盐物种向CO 吸附物种的转化反应是整个反应的速控步骤。Ag/Al 2 O 3 shows a {{very high}} {{activity}} for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx by HC (C 3 H 6 or C 2 H 5 OH) in excess oxygen. However, we found that {{a large amount of}} CO and unburned <b>THC</b> (<b>C</b> 2 H 5 OH as a reductant) were produced during the process. Here, we tried to use a suitable oxidation catalyst to remove these harmful by-products. The SCR of NOx by HC was investigated over Cu/Al 2 O 3 in excess oxygen. It was found that Cu/Al 2 O 3 has a high activity for removing the CO and HC, and a moderate activity for NOx reduction. This indicated that Cu/Al 2 O 3 was suitable to be set after Ag/Al 2 O 3 for the removal of by-products. The composite catalysts were formed by combining the Cu/Al 2 O 3 and the Ag/Al 2 O 3 with three different modes for removing the harmful CO. The activity results showed that the composite catalyst CIII formed by directly placing the Cu/Al 2 O 3 after the Ag/Al 2 O 3 is the best one among the composite catalysts. The CIII catalyst has proved to be quite effective to reduce NOx to N 2 by C 3 H 6 or C 2 H 5 OH, and simultaneously lower the concentrations of CO and unburned THC in effluent gases during the process. On the basis of the results at lab conditions, the Ag/Al 2 O 3 and Cu/Al 2 O 3 washcoated honeycomb catalyst were prepared and investigated for the removal of NOx by using C 2 H 5 OH as a reducing agent on a diesel engine at the practical operating condition. The Ag/Al 2 O 3 washcoated honeycomb catalyst also showed a high activity for NOx reduction by C 2 H 5 OH and the drawback of increasing the CO and unburned THC concentrations in diesel engine exhaust. By using the Cu/Al 2 O 3 washcoated honeycomb catalyst and the optimization of C 2 H 5 OH addition, the emissions of NOx, THC and CO meet EURO III standards under the EURO III 13 mode emission test running conditions. Catalytic elimination of formaldehyde (HCHO) was investigated over Cu/Al 2 O 3 at room temperature. It was shown that Cu/Al 2 O 3 has a good ability for the removal of HCHO, and appears to be promising for its application in destroying HCHO at room temperature. The results of the DRIFTS, Density functional theory calculations and TPD showed that HCHO is partially oxidized into HCOO- species over Cu/Al 2 O 3 at room temperature. With increasing the temperature, HCOO- species completely decomposed into CO 2 and desorpted from the catalyst surface, and the deactivated Cu/Al 2 O 3 was regenerated at the same time. In addition, although Cu had no obvious influence on the partial oxidation of HCHO on Al 2 O 3, Cu dramatically lowered the decomposition temperature of HCOO- species into CO 2. The TiO 2 supported noble metal catalysts were tested and compared for the catalytic oxidation of HCHO. Among them, 1 % Pt/TiO 2 was the most active catalyst. HCHO can be completely oxidized into CO 2 and H 2 O over the 1 % Pt/TiO 2 in a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 50, 000 h- 1 at room temperature. XRD and high resolution TEM patterns of the 1 % Pt/TiO 2 showed that Pt particles on TiO 2 are dispersed in a size smaller than 1 nm, which is very important for the high activity of Pt/TiO 2. In situ DRIFTS studies showed that adsorbed formate and CO species are the reaction intermediates, and the conversion of surface formate species to adsorbed CO is the rate-determining step of the catalytic oxidation of HCHO on the 1 % Pt/TiO 2 at room temperature...|$|R
