40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{potential}} effects on the profitability of Canary Islands’ farms due to the Special National Insurance System for Agricultural Workers Reform which {{was put in place}} in 2009 by the Spanish Government Ministry of Labour and Immigration. The effect on the employers’ National Insurance contributions per working day is analysed. Based on this analysis, the impact on costs and benefits in several farms which cultivate bananas, tomatoes or flowers is evaluated. According to the results, it is concluded that these farms cannot afford the costs’ increase derived from the reform if profitability per product unit or per surface should be maintained.

Based on experimental data collected from the literature, group contri-bution methods were developed for the estimation of viscosity, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, refractive index, isobaric expansivity, and isothermal compressi-bility, of various families of ionic liquids. Using the Stokes–Einstein relation a correla-tion for the self-diffusion coefficients with the viscosity is also proposed. The results of the proposed models show average absolute relative deviations generally of the same order of the experimental accuracy of the data.

40|$|In this work, {{a method}} of goal-adaptive Isogeometric Analysis is proposed. We combine goal-oriented error {{estimation}} and adaptivity with hierarchical B-splines for local h-refinement. The goal-oriented error estimator is computed with a p-refined discrete dual space, which is adaptively refined alongside the primal space. This discrete dual space is {{proven to be a}} strict superset of the primal space. Hierarchical refinements are introduced in marked regions that are formed as the union of chosen coarse-level spline supports from the primal basis. We present two ways of extracting localized refinement indicators suitable for the hierarchical refinement procedure: one based on a partitioning of the dual-weighted residual into <b>contributions</b> of <b>basis</b> function supports and one based on the combination of element indicators within a basis function support. The proposed goal-oriented adaptive strategy is exemplified for the Poisson problem and a free-surface flow problem.
