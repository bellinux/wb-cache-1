40|$|Help {{and support}} to a family is {{dissimilar}} in different countries according to the predominant principles in their social policy. The aim of this work is to give a synopsis of the current financial allowances to families in several countries of the European Union and to outline the dissimilarities among them. The partial aim is to point at the inadequate solutions in the state social support system in the Czech Republic and to suggest some more suitable solutions. Diploma work was created {{by means of the}} method of the qualitative research {{with the use of the}} secondary data analysis. The main body comprises five EU member states chosen by the method of the casual selection, regarding to their family policy system (Great Britain, Sweden, Germany, Spain and Slovakia). Information was acquired from several foreign language sources, largely from web sites of the <b>competent</b> <b>departments,</b> and international sources (MISSOC, EURES). Acquiring actual information wasn't always easy because different sources provided dissimilar information. It has figured out that the most important benefit for families is the child allowance, which is paid out in all studied countries. The criteria for the calculation of its rate are different { [...] }the age of a child, the sequence of a child in a family, the income of a family (only in the Czech Republic), eventually health disability of a child. The next benefit provided is the parental allowance, which is paid out only in three surveyed countries (Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia), it is paid out in Sweden too, but from parental insurance. The payment of benefits in Germany depends on the monthly income of a family; however, in the Czech Republic and Slovakia a parent, that cares for a child, can support his family without a financial limit, but it is not easy to coordinate work and the care for the family in the Czech Republic, because only small percentage of women has the opportunity to get part-time jobs. In my opinion, we can find the inspiration how to relieve the national budget from costs on payment of parental allowance in Swedish social insurance system, which is financed by contributions from employers, employees and taxes...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the organizational effects of digitalization. Barriers and facilitators of digitalization are studied as well. The thesis {{is divided into}} two parts: a literature re-view of the subject and an empirical study. The empirical study consists of codification of qualitative data collected by dr. Pertti Aaltonen as well as development of a G-Accelerate tool prototype. This thesis is a part of Need 4 Speed SRIA programs G-Accelerate project. Literature review presents findings of extant literature from different aspects of how digitalization affects organizations. Themes found in the literature are organizations size and shape, agility, digital innovations along with organizational learning and business ecosystems. Literature isolates organizational inertia and lack of understanding between top management and IT departments as barriers for digitalization. Main facilitators are top management support and <b>competent</b> IT <b>departments.</b> During the empirical research 13 categories were segregated from the data collected by dr. Aaltonen. The research was done using grounded theory methodology. Final catego-ries are: customer understanding, cooperation, ecosystems, business model design, ca-pabilities and competences, culture, performance indicators, leadership capabilities, customer’s customer, new business areas, management systems, organizational structures and process orientation. These categories were validated by having two researchers agree on the limits. G-Accelerate tool prototype was created based on the categories from the raw data. G-Accelerate tool is a psychometric questionnaire designed to find out organizational ca-pabilities, structures and processes regarding digitalization.

The ultimate objective of pharmacovigilance is patient safety.

Having a well planned job specific training curriculum can help the organization realize its goals and objectives by covering the gaps between current and desired job performance levels and existing competencies of its employees. Apart from this, trainings can help in problem solving, increasing productivity and prepare for and respond to future changes in the organization or job duties. As the pharmaceutical business continues to grow, increasing numbers of skilled people are required to manage resultant increase in pharmacovigilance activities to remain compliant. Thus, the need for training qualified resources to develop into highly skilled pharmacovigilance professionals is the need of the hour.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed. (Educational Psychology) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2011 This study {{investigated}} the causes of high failure rate of the 2003 to 2007 Grade 12 learners in the North West secondary schools (Central Region). The improvement of grade 12 results, particularly in disadvantaged secondary schools of the North West Province, is a burning issue which {{needs to be addressed}} with urgency. This study attempts to investigate factors contributing towards the causes of high failure rate of the Grade 12 learners. According to the researcher's opinion, the high failure rate of Grade 12 learners is a cause for a serious concern for every educator, school manager, Iearner, parent, politician and relevant stakeholders. According to the findings from the literature review, the high failure rate is caused by, inter alia, inadequate and/or lack of resources, over-crowded classrooms, inexperienced and under-qualified educators, the Post Provisioning Model, insufficient departmental support, poor infra-structure, poor socio-economic background of learners, poor parental involvement in learners' academic work, inconducive environment for both learning and teaching at most schools and inadequate role played by most educators, departmental officials (such as Subject Advisors and Institutional Curriculum Support Coordinators) and learners. Under normal circumstances, one expects that the researched schools would probably have achieved beyond 70 % as the pass rate benchmark in the final Grade 12 examinations. However, in most schools in the disadvantaged areas, this is not the case. As indicated in the afore-mentioned statements, and the complexity of the study in consultation with variables employed, the researcher opted to use both qualitative and quantitative research designs with the aim to attempt to obtain consistency, validity and reliability of the research results. The analyses of the results reveal that most schools in the disadvantaged areas still experience a poor culture of teaching and learning. This is evident by the low Grade 12 final results in the North West Province, particularly in Central Region. The study revealed that the factors impacting on the performance of learners at schools are subjected to a complexity of integrated activities. Apparently an issue of concern is lack of passion that is expected from most educators working at secondary schools. It could be concluded from many responses that the high failure rate of the Grade 12 learners is directly linked to poor teaching which {{may be the result of}} poor qualifications, Jack of discipline, poor support systems, lack of resources, and most importantly, lack of commitment and dedication required to ensure a professional approach towards teaching and good classroom management. The researcher concluded that certain serious measures must have to be adopted to ameliorate this sorry state of affairs. These included, inter alia, sufficient qualified and <b>competent</b> educators; the <b>Department</b> of Education's intervention to assist the poor performing schools; reduction of over-crowded classrooms; regular visit by Subject Advisors to schools; parents' involvement in their children's school-work; implementation of stringent discipline; and so forth.
