40|$|The {{objective}} of the Hall effect thruster plume contamination and erosion study was to evaluate {{the impact of a}} xenon ion plume on various samples placed in the vicinity of a Hall effect thruster for a continuous 100 hour exposure. NASA Glenn Research Center was responsible for the pre- and post-test evaluation of three sample types placed around the thruster: solar <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> <b>glass,</b> RTV silicone, and Kapton(R). Mass and profilometer), were used to identify the degree of deposition and/or erosion on the solar <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> <b>glass,</b> RTV silicone, and Kapton@ samples. Transmittance, reflectance, solar absorptance, and room temperature emittance were used to identify the degree of performance degradation of the solar <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> samples alone. Auger spectroscopy was used to identify the chemical constituents found {{on the surface of the}} exposed solar <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> samples. Chemical analysis indicated some boron nitride contamination on the samples, from boron nitride insulators used in the body of the thruster. However, erosion outweighted contamination. All samples exhibited some degree of erosion. with the most erosion occurring near the centerline of the plume and the least occurring at the +/- 90 deg positions. For the solar <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> samples, erosion progressed through the antireflective coating and into the microsheet glass itself. Erosion occurred in the solar <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> <b>glass,</b> RTV silicone and Kapton(R) at different rates. All optical properties changed with the degree of erosion, with solar absorptance and room temperature emittance increasing with erosion. The transmittance of some samples decreased while the reflectance of some samples increased and others decreased. All results are consistent with an energetic plume of xenon ions serving as a source for erosion...|$|E

Samples of doped and undoped cover glass and synthetic fused silica were irradiated with a total integrated flux of 10 to the 15 th power e/sq cm. Wideband transmission and spectral transmission measurements were made before and after irradiation. The results indicate that 1. 5 -percent ceria-doped cover glass is much less sensitive to radiation induced discoloration than undoped cover glass. Consequently, the glass is comparable to synthetic fused silica when used as a radiation resistant solar cell cover for many space missions...|$|E

A contaminant thickness of 0. 1 micron or more could result in a change in solar absorptance of the second-surface mirrors from 0. 06 to approximately 0. 16 in a period of about 1. 5 years in space. Calculations indicated that the VCM thickness would have to be less than approximately 0. 005 micron to keep the change in solar absorptance 0. 01 for a 3 -year mission...|$|R

Three polysiloxane-type coating materials, SWS V- 10, DC- 100, and CV- 1144 were evaluated with respect to atomic oxygen resistance, outgassing, contamination potential, stability under UV irradiation, electron-proton irradiation, thermal cycling, and long-term storage after application. Atomic oxygen testing included characterization of the atomic oxygen plasma using comparison of Kapton reaction to existing flight data, residual gas analysis, and temperature measurements.

40|$|A {{remarkable}} cell shape {{change was}} observed in Bacillus subtilis strain 168 under microculture conditions on CI agar medium (Spizizen’s minimal medium supplemented with a trace amount of yeast extract and Casamino acids). Cells cultured under a <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> changed in form from rod-shaped to spherical, large and irregular shapes that closely resembled L-form cells. The cell shape change was observed only with CI medium, not with Spizizen’s minimum medium alone or other rich media. The whole-cell protein profile of <b>cells</b> grown under <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> and <b>cells</b> grown on CI agar plates differed in several respects. Tandem mass analysis of nine gel bands which differed in protein expression between the two conditions showed that proteins related to nitrate respiration and fermentation were expressed in the shape-changed <b>cells</b> grown under <b>cover</b> <b>glass.</b> The <b>cell</b> shape change of CI cultures was repressed when excess KNO 3 {{was added to the}} medium. Whole-cell protein analysis of the normal rod-shaped cells grown with 0 ? 1 % KNO 3 and the shape-changed cells grown without KNO 3 revealed that the expression of the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (coded by the bfmB gene locus) was elevated in the shape-changed cells. Inactivation of the bfmB locus resulted in the repression of cell shape change, and cells in which bfmB expression was induced by IPTG did show change...|$|R

We found that although there is a compromise between the antenna efficiency and see-through percentage, one is able to optimize the antenna by carefully designing the mesh. To verify the design and integration, a meshed antenna operating at around 2. 3 GHz is printed with conductive ink on a plastic substrate and placed on-top of solar cells attached to an aluminum ground plane.

40|$|The Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP), a MIDEX mission {{built in}} {{partnership}} between Princeton University and the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), will study {{the cosmic microwave}} background. It will be inserted into a highly elliptical earth orbit for several weeks and then use a lunar gravity assist to orbit around the second Lagrangian point (L 2), 1. 5 million kilometers, anti-sunward from the earth. The charging environment for the phasing loops and at L 2 was evaluated. There is a limited set of data for L 2; the GEOTAIL spacecraft measured relatively low spacecraft potentials (approx. 50 V maximum) near L 2. The main area of concern for charging on the MAP spacecraft is the well-established threat posed by the "geosynchronous region" between 6 - 10 Re. The launch {{in the autumn of}} 2000 will coincide with the falling of the solar maximum, a period when the likelihood of a substorm is higher than usual. The likelihood of a substorm at that time has been roughly estimated to be on the order of 20 % for a typical MAP mission profile. Because of the possibility of spacecraft charging, a requirement for conductive spacecraft surfaces was established early in the program. Subsequent NASCAP/GEO analyses for the MAP spacecraft demonstrated that {{a significant portion of the}} sunlit surface (solar <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> and sunshade) could have nonconductive surfaces without significantly raising differential charging.

40|$|A lightweight, {{radiation}} hard, high performance, ultra-thin silicon {{solar cell}} is described that incorporates light trapping and a <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> {{as an integral}} part of the device. The manufacturing feasibility of high specific power, radiation insensitive, thin silicon solar cells was demonstrated experimentally and with a model. Ultra-thin, light trapping structures were fabricated and the light trapping demonstrated experimentally. The design uses a micro-machined, grooved back surface to increase the optical path length by a factor of 20. This silicon solar cell will be highly tolerant to radiation because the base width is less than 25 microns making it insensitive to reduction in minority carrier lifetime. Since the silicon is bonded without silicone adhesives, this solar cell will also be insensitive to UV degradation. These solar cells are designed as a form, fit, and function replacement for existing state of the art silicon solar cells with the effect of simultaneously increasing specific power, power/area, and power supply life.

40|$|Spacecraft {{charging}} of the International Space Station (ISS) {{is dominated}} by interaction of the US high voltage solar arrays with the F 2 -region ionosphere plasma environment. ISS solar array charging is enhanced in a high electron density environment due to the increased thermal electron currents {{to the edges of}} the solar cells. High electron temperature environments suppress charging due to formation of barrier potentials on the charged solar <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> that restrict the charging currents to the cell edge [Mandell et al., 2003]. Environments responsible for strong solar array charging are therefore characterized by high electron densities and low electron temperatures. In support of the ISS space environmental effects engineering community, we are working to understand a number of features of solar array charging and to determine how well future charging behavior can be predicted from in-situ plasma density and temperature measurements. One aspect of this work is a need to characterize the magnitude of electron density and temperature variations that occur at ISS orbital altitudes (approximately 400 km) over time scales of days, the latitudes over which significant variations occur, and the time periods over which the disturbances persist once they start. This presentation provides examples of mid-latitude electron density and temperature disturbances at altitudes relevant to ISS using data sets and tools developed for our ISS plasma environment study. "Mid-latitude" is defined as the extra-tropical region between approx. 30 degrees to approx. 60 degrees magnetic latitude sampled by ISS over its 51. 6 degree inclination orbit.

The effect of controlled sunlight from a range of different angles onto a solar cell is investigated in terms of current-voltage characteristics, and in particular the effect on short circuit current as compared to what is expected of theory.

Utah State University (USU) has performed measurements of the electron-, ion-, and photon-induced electron emission properties of conductors for a few years, and has recently extended our capabilities to measure electron yields of insulators, allowing us to significantly expand current spacecraft material charging databases. These ISS materials data are used here to illustrate our various insulator measurement techniques that include: i) Studies of electron-induced secondary and backscattered electron yield curves using pulsed, low current electron beams to minimize deleterious affects of insulator charging. ii) Comparison of several methods used to determine the insulator 1 st and 2 nd crossover energies. These incident electron energies induce unity total yield at the transition between yields greater than and less than one with either negative or positive charging, respectively. The crossover energies are very important in determining both the polarity and magnitude of spacecraft surface potentials. iii) Evolution of electron emission energy spectra as a function of insulator charging used to determine the surface potential of insulators. iv) Surface potential evolution as a function of pulsed-electron fluence to determine how quickly insulators charge, and how this can affect subsequent electron yields. v) Critical incident electron energies resulting in electrical breakdown of insulator materials and the effect of breakdown on subsequent emission, charging and conduction. vi) Charge-neutralization techniques such as low-energy electron flooding and UV light irradiation to dissipate both positive and negative surface potentials during yield measurements.

The nucleoids were found to consist of fibrous structures with diameters of 80 and 40 nm. This feature was shared with the E. coli nucleoid. However, whereas the E. coli nucleoid dynamically changed its structure to a highly compacted one towards the stationary phase, the S. aureus nucleoid never underwent such a tight compaction under a normal growth condition. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that this was attributable to the lack of IHF that regulate the expression of a nucleoid protein, Dps, required for nucleoid compaction in E. coli. On the other hand, under oxidative conditions, MrgA (a staphylococcal Dps homolog) was over-expressed and a drastic compaction of the nucleoid was detected.

The objective of this is also to improve the coefficient of utilization in the solarcollektor that exist on KAU. The purpose is to find a <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> that gives a better coefficient of utilization. The writer wills trough experiments find a <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> that got an optimal ability to capture the sun energy. To find the optimal <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> the writer will have to work with two parameters. The first one is the sun factor end the second one is the U-value. The advantage with a high sun factor is that you get a high inflow of the sun energy. The sun factor is a measurer of how match sun energy that transmission trough a glass construction. The advantage with a low U-value is that the <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> get a good ability to isolate, in question of setting the heath energy free that the solar collector has captured. It is impossible to get a <b>cover</b> <b>glass</b> that has both a high sun factor and a low U-value. The writer idea is to find an optimal <b>cover</b> <b>glass.</b> The glass will contain both a high sun factor and a low u-value as may be possible. Answers to the goal with this project: Summertime: No (The coefficient of utilization is unchanged) Wintertime: Yes (The coefficient of utilization is improved...|$|R
