The rf-induced endloss depends strongly on magnetic field and peaks at low field when the nonrelativistic ECRH resonance is located near the mirror peak. 1 Electrons in a mirror-confined, electron <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>heated</b> (ECRH) plasma diffuse in velocity-space, and may cross the loss-cone boundary and be lost, due to electric fields arising from collisions and rf waves.

50|$|Neutral beam {{injection}} (NBI) is {{one method}} used to heat plasma inside a fusion device consisting in {{a beam of}} high-energy neutral particles that can enter the confinement magnetic field. When these neutral particles are ionized by collision with the plasma particles, they are kept in the plasma by the confining magnetic field, and can transfer most of their energy by further collisions with the plasma. By tangential injection in the torus, neutral beams provide also momentum to the plasma and current drive, one essential feature for long pulses of burning plasmas. Neutral beam injection is a ﬂexible and reliable technique, {{which has been the}} main heating system on a large variety of fusion devices. To date, all NBI systems were based on positive precursor ion beams. In the 90s there has been impressive progress in negative ion sources and accelerators with the construction of multi-megawatt negative ion based NBI systems at LHD (H0, 180 keV) and JT-60U (D0, 500 keV). The NBI designed for ITER is a substantial challenge (D0, 1MeV, 40A) and a prototype is being constructed to optimize its performance in view of the ITER future operations.

It is planned that the reactor will study plasma pulses of up to 20 seconds duration until 2011, when it will be upgraded to study pulses of up to 300 seconds duration.
