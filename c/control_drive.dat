25|$|Since the 1950s medical care, {{public hygiene}} and {{sanitation}} improved considerably, and epidemics were controlled. Consecutive generations continuously experienced better health. The population growth rate surged as {{the mortality rate}} dropped more rapidly than the birth rate. China's massive population {{has always been a}} major difficulty for the government as it has struggled to provide for it. In the 1950s, food supply was inadequate and the standard of living was generally low. This spurred the authorities to initiate a major birth control program. The Great Leap Forward industrial plan in 1958â€“60 was partially responsible for a huge famine that caused the death rate to surpass the birth rate, and by 1960, the overall population was declining. A second population <b>control</b> <b>drive</b> began in 1962 with major efforts focused on promoting late marriages and the use of contraceptives. By 1963 the country was in the beginning of recovery from the famine and the birth rate soared to its highest since 1949 with an annual population growth rate of 3%. In 1966, the Cultural Revolution suspended this second family planning program, but resumed four years later with the third attempt by making later marriage and family size limitation an obligation. Since 1970, the efforts have been much more effective. The third family planning program continued until 1979 when the one child per family policy was implemented. By the early 1980s, China's population reached around 1billion and by the early 2000s, surpassed 1.3billion. In the 1980s, the average overall population growth was around 1.5%. In the 1990s, this fell to about 1%. Today it is about 0.6%. China's population growth rate is now among the lowest for a developing country, although, due to its large population, annual net population growth is still considerable. One demographic consequence of the one-child policy is that China {{is now one of the}} most rapidly ageing countries in the world.|$|E

40|$|Position sensorless vector <b>control</b> <b>drives</b> in the rotor-flux-oriented {{reference}} frame require precise estimation of rotor flux. A few open-loop rotor flux estimation methods are quite popular. However, {{the performance of}} these estimators is quite poor when the inverter switching frequency is quite low as in case of high power drives or when the ratio of switching frequency to maximum fundamental frequency is low as in case of high speed drives. This paper investigates an alternative approach of closed-loop rotor flux estimation for motor drives operated at low switching frequencies. This method is shown to be accurate in estimating the rotor flux, and thereby, ensuring good performance of the vector <b>controlled</b> <b>drive</b> at low as well as high speeds.

5000|$|Attachment {{may have}} the {{greatest}} amount of literature developed over the longest period of time. The early work of John Bowlby, and subsequent work of Mary Ainsworth and Mary Main, represent the foundations of attachment theory. Research has supported the link between initial attachment of the child and subsequent social success or failure throughout the developmental years and into adulthood. Attachment {{has been found to be}} a major aspect of the development of the brain related to social adjustment, mood <b>control,</b> <b>drive,</b> responsibility, and defining the personality. [...] As the brain matures, the emotional and sensory areas of the brain develop based upon the quality of attachment. A poor attachment early in life has been associated with a wide range of problems, including poor self-regulation, poor coping, undeveloped resiliency, abnormal social and moral development, and an increased risk of psychopathology.|$|E
50|$|Wangi 'A' Station {{consisted}} of three 50 MW Parsons turbo-alternators. Steam was supplied at 650PSI and 840degF from six spreader-stoker coal-fired Babcock & Wilcox (UK) (now Babcock International) cross drum boilers. The firing system {{consisted of}} the Spreader Stoker and Babcock & Wilcox Detroit Rotograte. Rapidly rotating blades of the spreader feeder unit flung coal of the required size onto the rotograte, with a large percentage igniting before landing on the grate. The amount of coal feed could be regulated by varying {{the length of the}} stroke of the pusher plate supplying fuel to the coal feeder. There were two rotogrates fitted which consisted of two endless chains carrying transverse grate bars in a revolving action. Eight coal feeder units controlled through Reeves variable speed <b>control</b> <b>drive.</b> Each boiler had an output of 180,000 lb/h.

50|$|Bailey and May Farquharson {{joined forces}} in 1937 {{and began working}} on other {{strategies}} {{to improve the lives}} of women. One of the issues they discussed was family planning and another, was an initiative called Save the Children Fund, which they founded in 1938. Joining forces with them were Mary Morris Knibb, Dr. Jai Lal Varma, and Dr. Pengelley. With seed money given by Mayâ€™s father Arthur Farquharson, Bailey traveled to London with Una Marson to raise funds for providing food, clothing and textbooks to Jamaican school children. The fund drive was a resounding success and the organization is still thriving. While in England, Bailey became the first Jamaican to testify to the Royal Commission headed by Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne about labor unrest, the burgeoning trade union movement, as well as the political unrest plaguing Jamaica at that time. She also met with proponents of family planning and when she returned to Jamaica, a birth <b>control</b> <b>drive</b> was launched in 1939 with a seminar held at the Ward Theater.|$|E

The front axle was a Worldmaster unit and the rear {{was similar to the}} Worldmaster unit but with the driving head inverted. Leyland Self-Changing Gears Pneumocyclic transmission was offered in 4 or 5-speed versions, with electric or pneumatic <b>control.</b> <b>Drive</b> was transmitted from engine to gearbox through either a centrifugal clutch or in later models via a fluid-friction coupling which enabled a solid connection at higher road speeds. An Eaton two speed driving head to the axle was optional. For the Australian market only a third tag axle, mounted ahead of the rear axle, was also offered. This was based on the Worldmaster rear axle but without a driving head, and was fitted into a suspension system based on that of the Albion Reiver 6x2 lorry. The purpose was to reduce axle loading. Most of the 6x2 Lions went to the Western Australian Government Railways and had passenger and cargo bodies fitted.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{demands of}} dynamics and accuracy in machine tools and {{the requirement of}} many additional features, like process or machine monitoring, effect not only the construction of tool machines but also the <b>drive</b> <b>control.</b> In the <b>drive</b> <b>control</b> of the present days, specialized digital signal processors and microcontrollers are used. Because they are made for standard <b>drive</b> <b>control</b> with high quantities and low prices, {{there is a lack}} of flexibility and openness towards new sensors or control algorithms. To include new technologies in an existing <b>drive</b> <b>control</b> severe changes in both software and hardware are required. This makes it difficult and expensive to adjust the <b>drive</b> <b>control</b> to the special needs of manufacturing processes and machines differing from the standard. In this thesis a new approach for <b>drive</b> <b>control</b> is shown which fulfills the requirements of present-day machines and future developments in that it is flexible and open so it can be easily adjusted to special processes and machines. This flexibility is achieved by a hardware based on programable logic. A library provides modules, containing all the functions for the <b>drive</b> <b>control,</b> process control, sensors analysis, machine monitoring, etc. The drive controller can be configured out of this library so that it provides exactly the functions needed by the process or machine. Besides the programable logic, the <b>drive</b> <b>control</b> provides slots where hardware interfaces towards sensors, actors, or fieldbusses can be added. This thesis introduces the architecture of an open <b>drive</b> <b>control,</b> covering the modularization of the drive functions, the infrastructure needed for execution of the modules, for communication in between the modules, and for monitoring them. The openness and flexibility of the system requires special development tools also shown here.
