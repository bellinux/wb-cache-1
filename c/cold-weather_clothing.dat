500|$|With the Middlesex in the vanguard, {{the lead}} {{elements}} of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade successfully crossed the Chongchon unopposed at Sinanju on 24 October using assault boats. The British battalion then established a defensive position over-looking the main bridge {{in preparation for the}} remainder of the brigade to continue the advance the following day. However, both the road and rail bridges at Sinanju had previously been damaged and they were subsequently found to be unsuitable for use by vehicles and armour, while the tidal current also prevented the rafting of even light vehicles by the American engineers attached to the brigade. Meanwhile, the road bridge at Anju, [...] east, was also found to be damaged by ROK 1st Division when it entered the town. Following repairs the bridge was made available to the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade's light wheeled vehicles on 25 October, while the accompanying Sherman tanks located a ford [...] upstream, and were able to cross the Chongchon at that point. With winter approaching, the British and Australians encountered the first of the cold weather as the temperature began to drop well below freezing at night. Consequently, prior to leaving Sinanju purpose-designed American <b>cold-weather</b> <b>clothing</b> was issued; however, with stocks in short supply only a few of the men received the equipment, even after a second issue was arranged several days later.|$|E

Soon, the crew was in radio contact with a rescue team in an approaching helicopter, who confirmed they were in the Soviet Union, near the town of Aleysk. The deep snow, the high altitude, and the terrain meant the rescuers had great difficulty in making contact with the cosmonauts. It was the next day before they were safely airlifted out. The crew were returned to Star City; the capsule was recovered some time later.|$|R
500|$|Putnik {{reasoned}} that Austro-Hungarian supply lines would become overstretched as their forces pressed deeper into Serbia while the Serbs {{would continue to}} hold the railheads in the Serbian interior. On 10 November, he ordered a general retreat from the Jadar and withdrew the Serbian 2nd Army to Ub and positioned the 1st and 3rd armies north and west of Valjevo. Meanwhile, the Užice Army took up positions to defend the town from which it took its name. The Austro-Hungarians pressed after the Serbs, hoping to capture the Obrenovac–Valjevo railroad. Clashes ensued and the Serbian Army managed to prevent the Austro-Hungarians from taking the railroad for a time. It quickly became clear to Putnik that he had underestimated the Austro-Hungarians, who managed to bring their heavy artillery through the muddy Serbian country roads. They established firing positions on the Serbian side of the Drina and began targeting the Serbian Army, which suffered heavy casualties. Morale plummeted amongst the Serbs, who were already significantly demoralized due a lack of <b>cold-weather</b> <b>clothing</b> and ammunition and exhausted by the long retreat towards the Serbian interior. Putnik realized that his forces would need to regroup {{if they were to}} provide any effective resistance to the Austro-Hungarians. He ordered that Valjevo be abandoned and had the Serbian Army take up positions on the Kolubara. The retreat towards the river was long and excruciating, with the Serbs being forced to destroy all bridges and telephone lines so that they would not fall into Austro-Hungarian hands. The Serbian Army also abandoned most of its heavy equipment to speed up the withdrawal. Seeing that the situation was critical and that Serbian forces were lacking artillery, ammunition and supplies, Pašić sought the help of the Triple Entente. He sent a telegram to his envoys abroad, which read: [...] "Urgent help is required. Beg and plead." [...] France provided the Serbs with munitions and supplies. Representatives of Russia and the United Kingdom [...] "expressed understanding", but those countries failed to deliver weapons and munitions.|$|E

As resupply was not guaranteed at the time, the onboard infantry were heavily laden with ample food, water, <b>cold-weather</b> <b>clothing,</b> night-vision and communications equipment in addition to weapons and ammunition.

50|$|The FROG {{program was}} {{developed}} in 2006, and fielding to units began in 2007.

When exposed to water or sweat and improperly dried, the fabric would become brittle and seams would fail significantly with little stress. Marine officials have begun issuing additional suits as an interim response until the issue can be addressed.|$|E

In response to this order, the members began to wear plain blue jackets or otherwise obscure the offending letters. Within weeks, the FEMS Chief issued another uniform change, the fifth in a year, that prohibited plain blue jackets.|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology [© Springer-Verlag] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] meta-analysis of the effect of body and air movement on the insulation provided by workwear and <b>cold-weather</b> <b>clothing</b> [1. 22 clo (0. 189 m 2 °C W − 1) <I T< 4. 14 clo (0. 642 m 2 °C W − 1) ] using data from different sources was performed. For the effect of walking, datasets could be merged and a single prediction equation produced (r 2 = 0. 91). For the effect of wind, and interaction of movement and wind, separate equations were required for regular workwear (r 2 = 0. 93) and <b>cold-weather</b> <b>clothing</b> (r 2 = 0. 97). Differences were mainly due to the different amounts of nude surface area. An interaction between wind and walking effects was present (the size of the combined effects is less than the sum of the separate effects), and for <b>cold-weather</b> <b>clothing</b> an effect of clothing air permeability (p) was present (high p→bigger effect). The resulting prediction equations will be proposed for inclusion in European and ISO standards on protective clothing to assist the user in determining the real-life clothing insulation value...|$|E

40|$|There {{seem to be}} {{situations}} when it will {{be impossible}} for <b>cold-weather</b> <b>clothing</b> to protect the extremities sufficiently (1), and in these situations, particularly if manual dexterity is required, auxiliary heating can provide a solution. Operating weapon systems as the anti-armour weapon TOW (Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-command link guided missile), where the users are directly exposed to the cold environment, is such a situation. The problem of keeping the hands wann in a cold environment, is due to the geometry of the fingers (thin cylinders) and the difficulty of maintaining the blood supply to the fingers of a generally peripheral vasoconstricted man. The hands cannot be kept warm in cold environments except by maintaining the blood circulation by exercise, by withdrawing the hand into the parka, or by artificial heat (2). The {{purpose of this study was}} first to determine the effectiveness of the NDRE developed heater-system of applying heat to the body, primarily to the hands. The second purpose was to examine the effect of this heater-system on marksmanship perfonnance during cold exposure under field conditions. Figure 1.
