40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} the potential contribu-tion of irradiated medium to the bystander effect using cus-tom-made double-Mylar stainless steel rings. Exponentially growing human–hamster hybrid (AL) cells were plated on ei-ther one or both sides of double-Mylar dishes 2 – 4 days before irradiation. One side (with or without cells) was irradiated with a particles using the track segment mode of a 4 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator at the Radiological Research Ac-celerator Facility of Columbia University. Since a particles can traverse only a very limited distance (around 23 mm in water), cells plated {{on the other side}} of a medium-filled Mylar dish will not be irradiated by the a particles. The results of the cytogenetic assay of unirradiated target cells that were attached to the top Mylar layer indicate that the number of <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> was higher when there was a bot-tom layer of cells in the medium-filled chambers than with just medium alone. Furthermore, when the medium was transferred from these cell-irradiated dishes to fresh AL cell cultures, <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> were produced in the unirradiated fresh cells. In contrast, medium irradiated in the absence of cells had no effect on chromatid aberrations. These results suggest that certain unidentified modulating factors se-creted from the irradiated cells on the bottom Mylar layer into the medium induce chromatin damage in the unirradi-ated bystander cells. q 2004 by Radiation Research Societ...|$|R

Freeze-dried sperm samples were preserved at 4, 25 and 50 ℃ for short duration (1 day to 2 months) and at 25 ℃ for long duration (2 years). The spermatozoa were injected into mouse oocytes to analyse the chromosomes of the zygotes at the first cleavage metaphase.

To further explore the feasibility of the painting approach to detect chemically induced stable aberrations, we treated mice with a single high dose of benzene, a potent bone-marrow-targeting clastogenic chemical and sacrificed them 24, 36 h or 15 days later to collect bone marrow cells and analyze chromatid- and chromosome-type aberrations by FISH painting. In addition, we treated another group of mice with 18 daily low doses to show the potential for aberration induction and accumulation under chronic exposure. <b>Chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> were significantly increased 24 and 36 h after acute treatment while chromosome-type ones were elevated above control values 36 h and 15 days after exposure, showing that {{at least part of}} benzene-induced chromatid exchanges were converted into potentially stable chromosome aberrations. The most common aberration was an extra copy of one painted chromosome in a metaphase with the euploid number of centromeres which was interpreted as the consequence of a symmetric recombination between pericentromeric regions of one painted and one unpainted chromatid. Under chronic exposure, neither chromosome- nor <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> were significantly elevated over control values, suggesting that the probability of enough primary lesions and secondary DNA double strand breaks occurring close enough together in time to allow chromosome exchanges to form is a critical limiting factor especially in a cycling cell population...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{investigated}} the influence of sex and ageing on chromosomal damage {{and the role of}} life-style habits on the frequency of chromosomal aberrations (CAs) in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of healthy Bosnian subjects. Materials and Methods: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 100 healthy, unrelated individuals in Bosnia and Herzegovina during 2010 and 2011. Chromosome preparations were made by dropping and air drying and slides were stained with 10 % Giemsa solution (pH 6. 8). The cytogenetic analysis was carried out in a cytogenetic laboratory in the Department of Biology of the Faculty of Science in Sarajevo. The category of total structural CAs was sub classified as chromosome-type <b>aberrations</b> (CSAs) and <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> (CTAs) while the category of total numerical CAs was sub classified as aneuploid and polyploid mitoses. All statistical analyses were carried out using Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corporation) and the Windows Kwikstat Winks SDA 7. 0. 2 statistical software package (Texa Soft Cedar Hill, Texas). Results: Cytogenetic analysis revealed the average number of structural CAs was 2. 84 and of numerical CAs was 9. 56. There was {{a significant increase in the}} frequency of chromosome-type aberrations (1. 92) compared with <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> (CTAs) (0. 92) and a significant increase in the frequency of aneuploid (8. 83) compared with polyploid (0. 73) mitoses. Significant positive correlations between age and CTAs in human PBLs were also demonstrated. Additional statistical analysis showed that ageing increase number of numerical CAs in lymphocytes of drinkers. The frequency of structural CAs of females exposed to radiation was significantly greater than in males. Analysis indicates the presence of a positive association between CAs and smoking in younger subjects but a negative correlation between aberrant cells frequencies and alcohol in older drinkers.

40|$|Abstract: The {{relationship}} between loss of seed viability and {{the accumulation of}} chromosomal aberrations was investigated in both landraces and cultivars of the pea (Pisum sativum L.). It was shown here, {{for the first time}} with pea landraces, that loss of seed viability is associated with an increase in the frequency of chromosomal abberrations, and that even small losses of viability result in some chromosomal damage in the seeds of pea landraces as well as in the seeds of pea cultivars. In addition, for a given loss of viability the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in either low or high moisture content seed lots was the same. However, it was shown that under identical storage conditions, low moisture content seeds of the laudraces exhibit greater longevity than those of the cultivars. Following ageing, <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> (in particular single fragments) were most frequently observed in the surviving seeds of both pea cultivars and landraces. The relevance of these findings to the long term conservation of pea germplasm is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Functional telomeres are {{protected}} from non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathways. Replication {{is a critical}} period for telomeres because of the requirement for reconstitution of functional protected telomere conformations, a process that involves DNA repair proteins. Using knockdown of DNA-PKcs and Rad 51 expression in three different cell lines, we demonstrate the respective involvement of NHEJ and HR {{in the formation of}} telomere aberrations induced by the G-quadruplex ligand 360 A during or after replication. HR contributed to specific <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> (telomere losses and doublets) affecting the lagging strand telomeres, whereas DNA-PKcs-dependent NHEJ was responsible for sister telomere fusions as a direct consequence of G-quadruplex formation and/or stabilization induced by 360 A on parental telomere G strands. NHEJ and HR activation at telomeres altered mitotic progression in treated cells. In particular, NHEJ-mediated sister telomere fusions were associated with altered metaphase-anaphase transition and anaphase bridges and resulted in cell death during mitosis or early G 1. Collectively, these data elucidate specific molecular and cellular mechanisms triggered by telomere targeting by the G-quadruplex ligand 360 A, leading to cancer cell death...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{lethality}} is {{a powerful}} approach to study selective cell killing based on genotype. We show that loss of Rad 52 function is synthetically lethal with breast cancer 2, early onset (BRCA 2) deficiency, whereas there was no impact on cell growth and viability in BRCA 2 -complemented cells. The frequency of both spontaneous and double-strand break-induced homologous recombination and ionizing radiation-induced Rad 51 foci decreased by 2 – 10 times when Rad 52 was depleted in BRCA 2 -deficient cells, with little to no effect in BRCA 2 -complemented cells. The absence of both Rad 52 and BRCA 2 resulted in extensive chromosome <b>aberrations,</b> especially <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations.</b> Ionizing radiation-induced and S phase-associated Rad 52 -Rad 51 foci form equally well in {{the presence or absence}} of BRCA 2, indicating that Rad 52 can respond to DNA double-strand breaks and replication stalling independently of BRCA 2.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of camptothecin (CPT) -induced break points in late S or G 2 {{phase of the}} cell cycle observed in Chinese hamster chromosomes was analysed in 400 metaphases. Contrary to expectation, they were not localized in the heterochromatic regions, suggesting that these <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> arise by a mechanism which does not involve collision of the CPT-trapped 'cleavable complex' with the replication fork. Since many break points mapped more frequently to light bands (DAPI negative) than dark bands (DAPI positive) with a frequency of 73 and 15 % respectively, {{it could be argued}} that the presence of the CPT-trapped 'cleavable complex' probably interferes with chromatin condensation. In fact, the euchromatic regions, which are expected to be more actively condensed in G 2 phase, were more involved in chromosomal damage. These results do not completely confirm the idea that some residual DNA synthesis occurring in G 2 is responsible for the G 2 clastogenic effects of CPT as the heterochromatic regions should, in this case, be more involved.

40|$|Telomere {{maintenance}} {{is essential to}} preserve genomic stability and involves several telomere-specific proteins as well as DNA replication and repair proteins. The kinase ATR, which has a crucial function in maintaining genome integrity from yeast to human, {{has been shown to}} be involved in telomere maintenance in several eukaryotic organisms, including yeast, Arabidopsis and Drosophila. However, its role in telomere maintenance in mammals remains poorly explored. Here, we report by using telomere-fluorescence in situ hybridization (Telo-FISH) on metaphase chromosomes that ATR deficiency causes telomere instability both in primary human fibroblasts from Seckel syndrome patients and in HeLa cells. The telomere aberrations resulting from ATR deficiency (i. e. sister telomere fusions and <b>chromatid-type</b> telomere <b>aberrations)</b> are mainly generated during and/or after telomere replication, and involve both leading and lagging strand telomeres as shown by chromosome orientation-FISH (CO-FISH). Moreover, we show that ATR deficiency strongly sensitizes cells to the G-quadruplex ligand 360 A, enhancing sister telomere fusions and <b>chromatid-type</b> telomere <b>aberrations</b> involving specifically the lagging strand telomeres. Altogether, these data reveal that ATR plays a critical role in telomere maintenance during and/or after telomere replication in human cells...|$|R

40|$|Genomic {{instability}} {{has been}} proposed to be the earliest step in radiation-induced tumorigenesis. It follows from this hypothesis that individuals highly susceptible to induction of tumors by radiation should exhibit enhanced radiation-induced instability. BALB/c white mice are considerably more sensitive to radiation-induced mammary cancer than C 57 BL/ 6 black mice. In this study, primary mammary epithelial cell cultures from these two strains were examined for the "delayed" appearance of chromosomal aberrations after exposure to 137 Cs gamma radiation, {{as a measure of}} radiation-induced genomic instability. As expected, actively dividing cultures from both strains showed a rapid decline of initial asymmetrical aberrations with time postirradiation. However, after 16 population doublings, cells from BALB/c mice exhibited a marked increase in the frequency of chromatid-type breaks and gaps which remained elevated throughout the time course of the experiment (28 doublings). No such effect was observed for the cells of C 57 BL/ 6 mice; after the rapid clearance of initial aberrations, the frequency of <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> in the irradiated population remained at or near those of nonirradiated controls. These results demonstrate a correlation between the latent expression of chromosomal damage in vitro and susceptibility for mammary tumors, and provide further support for the central role of radiation-induced instability in the process of tumorigenesis...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{investigate}} whether occupational exposure to antineoplastic drugs (AND) resulted in genetic damage, possibly indicative of adverse health effects in the long term. We performed a chromosomal aberrations (CA) analysis in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of a group of 76 trained nurses occupationally exposed to AND. Furthermore, we analysed whether genetic polymorphisms in four metabolic genes of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family involved in antineoplastic drugs detoxification (GSTM 1, GSTT 1, GSTP 1, GSTA 1) had any effect on the yield of chromosomal aberrations in nurses exposed to antineoplastic agents. The exposed group showed a very significant increase of genetic damage (p < 0. 0001) potentially indicative of an increased risk of cancer. Unexpectedly, besides the elevated level of <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> usually related to exposure to chemical agents, we found also severe chromosome damages such as chromosome deletions and dicentric chromosomes, usually related to radiation exposure. No significant association was detected between all GSTs genotypes and chromosome damage. In conclusion, our data show how the occupational exposure to AND is associated to a potential cancer risk, suggesting that current prevention methods do not completely eliminate opportunities for exposure and supporting the need to improve the actual safety practices.

To elucidate the assumed genotoxic potential, chromosome aberrations were analyzed in 125 I-UdR-exposed human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). After 18 h labeling with 125 I-UdR the cell cycle distribution is severely disturbed. Furthermore, 40 % of PBL are fully labelled and 20 % show a moderate uptake. Primarily <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> are induced. PBL reveal a very broad dose-dependent response spectrum: equal numbers of cells have either no aberration, or display a moderate aberration level. Few cells exhibit a high aberration score (> 10 aberrations). A dose-dependent increase of aberrations is measured {{in the range of}} 0. 2 to 2 Gy, followed by a plateau between 2 and 4. 5 Gy. The data indicate that even the lowest dose of 0. 2 Gy leads to a 4. 5 -fold increase of aberrations in PBL compared to the controls. Furthermore, a dose-dependent increase of cell death is observed. 125 I-UdR has a very strong genotoxic capacity in human PBL even at very low doses of about 0. 2 Gy. Efficiently labeled cells display a prolonged cell cycle compared to moderate labeled cells and cell death contributes substantially to the desynchronisation of the cell cycle.

Early (ES) or late (LS) S-phase cells were assessed by pulse incorporating the base analogue 5 -bromo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) immediately after UV-C irradiation (30 J/m 2) or AluI (20 U) poration followed by BrdU immunodetection with FITC-tagged antibodies in metaphase spreads. Short (30 s) UV-C exposures (1 J/m 2 /s) induced BP preferentially in Xqh in LS cells and a random distribution of BP along Xpe and Xqh in ES cells. However, BP induced by long (5 min) UV-C exposures (0. 1 J/m 2 /s) clustered according to arm replication time (Xpe during ES and Xqh along LS). Giemsa-stained metaphases showed elevated frequencies of UV-C induced <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> and gaps, especially in cells exposed to longer UV-C irradiation. BP induced by AluI clustered in Xpe in ES but distributed randomly during LS. In contrast to UV-C, AluI did not produce an increase in the yield of gaps, neither in ES nor in LS cells.

Conventional analysis, scoring 1000 metaphases per subject, showed {{no significant difference between}} miners and controls in the frequencies of chromosome- and <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations.</b> Investigators at two laboratories undertook FISH analyses, each scoring 4000 metaphases per subject. When the data from each laboratory were examined separately, one found slightly more translocations in the miners while the other found fewer. In neither case was the difference significant at the 95 % level of confidence. Combining the data likewise showed no significant excess of damage in the miners. This applied to simple one- and two-way translocations and to cells with complex exchanges. There was no correlation between levels of translocations and total lifetime doses from occupational and/or background irradiation. A borderline significant excess of rogue cells was found in the miners. This may be a chance observation, as these rare, highly abnormal cells are considered to be unrelated to radiation exposure and are probably due to a virus. The overall conclusion is that the frequency of chromosomal damage in the miners did not exceed that in the controls.

40|$|There is accumulating {{evidence}} that an individual’s inability to accurately repair DNA damage {{in a timely}} fashion may in part dictate a predisposition to cancer. Dogs spontaneously develop lymphoproliferative diseases such as lymphoma, with the golden retriever (GR) breed being at especially high risk. Mechanisms underlying such breed susceptibility are largely unknown; however, studies of heritable cancer predisposition in dogs may be much more straightforward than similar studies in humans, owing to a high degree of inbreeding and more limited genetic heterogeneity. Here, we conducted a pilot study with 21 GR with lymphoma, 20 age-matched healthy GR and 20 age-matched healthy mixed-breed dogs (MBD) to evaluate DNA repair capability following exposure to either ionizing radiation (IR) or the chemical mutagen bleomycin. Inter-individual variation in DNA repair capacity was evaluated in stimulated canine lymphoctyes exposed in vitro utilizing the G 2 chromosomal radiosensitivity assay to quantify clastogen-induced <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> (gaps and breaks).

CAMP interferes with topoisomerase I to induce single-strand DNA breaks. Thus, we expected the two drugs to induce different types of chromosomal aberra-tions (CAs). However, both drugs produced quantitatively and qualitatively similar numbers and types of aberrations under similar experimental conditions. In mouse bone marrow exposed over an 18 -h period, both drugs (3 mg/kg) induced ~ 30 damaged cells, with an average of 0. 4 chromatid breaks per cell (in 100 cells analyzed/mouse). In addition, both drugs induced only <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> in mouse bone marrow in vivo when exposure occurred during G 2. Cell cycle specificity was indicated by the absence of CAs when exposure to the drugs occurred in vivo in mouse PBLs during Go. In L 5178 Y cells, m-AMSA was considerably more potent for the induction of mutations and somewhat more potent for the induction of CAs than CAMP was. In contrast to the in vivo bone marrow results, the drugs induced high levels of both chromatid- and chromosome-type aberra-tions in vitro.

Methods: For each donor, PBL were incubated with I- 125 -UdR for 5 h (2. 5 and 5 kBq/ml). The culture was fixed for aberrations at 72 h post-stimulation. hTERT-RPE 1 cells were exposed to I- 125 -UdR activities ranging from 0. 5 – 4 kBq/ml. The cells were harvested for aberrations at 26 h after initiation of the culture. All slides were stained with 10 % Giemsa. For each dose point 100 metaphases were analysed. For both PBL and hTERT-RPE 1 cells, cell cycle analysis using EdU Flow Cytometry Assay Kits (Invitrogen) was performed. Results: Our preliminary data show that I- 125 -UdR primarily induce <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations.</b> An enhanced level of aberrations was observed at already 100 accumulated decays per cell, whereof one decay per cell per 20 min was calculated. The cell cycle of both PBL and hTERT-RPE 1 cell line are delayed due to incorporation of I- 125 -UdR in the DNA, when compared to control cells. Conclusions: I- 125 -UdR posses a strong genotoxic capacity in PBL and hTERT-RPE 1 cells even at very low numbers of accumulated decays.

40|$|Human cancers {{are often}} {{associated}} with numerical and structural chromosomal instability. Structural chromosomal aberrations (CAs) in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) arise as consequences of direct DNA damage or due to replication on a damaged DNA template. In both cases, DNA repair is critical and inter-individual differences in its capacity are probably due to corresponding genetic variations. We investigated functional variants in DNA repair genes (base and nucleotide excision repair, double-strand break repair) in relation to CAs, <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> (CTAs) and chromosome-type aberrations (CSAs) in healthy individuals. Chromosomal damage was determined by conventional cytogenetic analysis. The genotyping was performed by both {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} and TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Multivariate logistic regression was applied for testing individual factors on CAs, CTAs and CSAs. Pair-wise genotype interactions of 11 genes were constructed for all possible pairs of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Analysed individually, we observed significantly lower CTA frequencies in association with XPD Lys 751 Gln homozygous variant genotype [odds ratio (OR) 0. 64, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 48 - 0. 85, P = 0. 004; n = 1777]. A significant association of heterozygous variant genotype in RAD 54 L with increased CSA frequency (OR 1. 96, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 4. 02, P = 0. 03) was determined in 282 subjects with available genotype. By addressing gene-gene interactions, we discovered 14 interactions significantly modulating CAs, 9 CTAs and 12 CSAs frequencies. Highly significant interactions included always pairs from two different pathways. Although individual variants in genes encoding DNA repair proteins modulate CAs only modestly, several gene-gene interactions in DNA repair genes evinced either enhanced or decreased CA frequencies suggesting that CAs accumulation requires complex interplay between different DNA repair pathways...|$|R
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that increased frequency of chromosomal aberration (CA) in peripheral blood lymphocytes is a predictor of cancer, but further data are needed to better characterize CA as marker of cancer risk. From the archives of 15 laboratories we gathered cytogenetic records of 11, 834 subjects who were free of cancer {{at the moment of}} blood drawing and who underwent cytogenetic examination for preventive purposes in the Czech Republic during 1975 – 2000. We linked these records to the national cancer registry, revealing a total of 485 cancer cases. Subjects were classified according to the percentiles of CA distribution within each laboratory as low (0 – 33 rd percentile), medium (34 – 66 th percentile), and high (66 – 100 th percentile). Subjects were further classified by occupational exposure and by subclass of CA. We found a significant association between the overall cancer incidence and the presence of chromosome-type aberrations [relative risk (RR) for high vs. low CA level = 1. 24; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 03 – 1. 50] but not <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations.</b> Stomach cancer showed a strong association with frequency of total CA (RR = 7. 79; 95 % CI, 1. 01 – 60. 0). The predictivity of CA observed in subjects exposed to various classes of carcinogens did not significantly differ from the group of nonexposed subjects. This study contributes to validation of CA as a predictive marker of cancer risk, in particular, of stomach cancer; the association between CA frequency and cancer risk might be limited to chromosometype aberrations.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this project is to {{determine}} if low doses (below or equal to the level traditionally requiring human radiation protection, i. e. {{less than or equal}} to 10 cGy) of low LET radiation can induce genomic instability. The magnitude of genomic instability was measured as delayed chromosome instability in bone marrow cells of exposed mice with different levels of endogenous DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) activity, i. e. high (C 57 BL/ 6 J mice), intermediate (BALB/cJ mice), and extremely low (Scid mice). In addition, at early time points (1 and 4 hrs) following irradiation, levels of activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-{kappa}B), a transcription factor known to be involved in regulating the expression of genes responsible for cell protection following stimuli, were measured in these cells. Bone marrow cells were collected at different times following irradiation, i. e. 1 hr, 4 hrs, 1 month, and 6 months. A total of five mice per dose per strain were sacrificed at each time point for sample collection. As a result, a total of 80 mice from each strain were used. The frequency and the type of metaphase chromosome aberrations in bone marrow cells collected from exposed mice at different times following irradiation were used as markers for radiation-induced genomic instability. A three-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) protocol for mouse chromosomes 1, 2, and 3 was used for the analysis of delayed stable chromosomal aberrations in metaphase cells. All other visible <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> and gross structural abnormalities involving non-painted chromosomes were also evaluated on the same metaphase cells used for scoring the stable chromosomal aberrations of painted chromosomes. Levels of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-{kappa}B) activation were also determined in cells at 1 and 4 hrs following irradiation (indicative of early responses) ...|$|R
40|$|Significant inter-individual {{variation}} in G 2 chromosomal radiosensitivity, measured as radiation-induced <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations</b> {{in the subsequent}} metaphase, {{has been reported in}} peripheral blood lymphocytes of both healthy individuals and a range of cancer patients. One possible explanation for this variation is that it is driven, at least in part, by the efficiency of G 2 –M checkpoint control. The hypothesis tested in the current analysis is that increased G 2 chromosomal radiosensitivity is facilitated by a less efficient G 2 –M checkpoint. The study groups comprised 23 childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, their 23 partners and 38 of their offspring (Group 1) and 29 childhood and young adult cancer survivors (Group 2). Following exposure to 0. 5 Gy of 300 kV X-rays, lymphocyte cultures were assessed for both G 2 checkpoint delay and G 2 chromosomal radiosensitivity. In Group 1, the extent of G 2 checkpoint delay was measured by mitotic inhibition. No statistically significant differences in G 2 checkpoint delay were observed between the cancer survivors (P = 0. 660) or offspring (P = 0. 171) and the partner control group nor was there any significant relationship between G 2 checkpoint delay and G 2 chromosomal radiosensitivity in the cancer survivors (P = 0. 751), the partners (P = 0. 634), the offspring (P = 0. 824) or Group 1 taken as a whole (P = 0. 379). For Group 2, G 2 checkpoint delay was assessed with an assay utilising premature chromosome condensation to distinguish cell cycle stage. No significant relationship between G 2 checkpoint delay and G 2 chromosomal radiosensitivity was found (P = 0. 284). Thus, this study does not support a relationship between G 2 –M checkpoint efficiency and {{variation in}} G 2 chromosomal radiosensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: It {{has been}} shown that I- 123 -labeled {{estrogen}} treatment induced chromosome aberrations with an efficiency of about one aberration for each 1000 disintegrations in estrogen receptor-positive Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-ER) cells. RBE values for chromatid damage induced by Zn- 65 compared to γ-radiation were found to be in the range from about 1 - 3 repectively 2 - 5 depending on the assumed intracellular distribution pattern of Zn- 65. To elucidate the genotoxic potential of DNA-associated AEE, chromosomal /chromatid aberrations were analyzed in Iodine- 125 -deoxyuridine (I- 125 -UdR) exposed human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and in human telomerase-immortalized retinal pigment epithelial cells (hTERT-RPE 1). Methods: For each donor, PBL were incubated with I- 125 -UdR for 5 h (2. 5 and 5 kBq/ml). The culture was fixed for aberrations at 72 h post-stimulation. hTERT-RPE 1 cells were exposed to I- 125 -UdR activities ranging from 0. 5 – 4 kBq/ml. The cells were harvested for aberrations at 26 h after initiation of the culture. All slides were stained with 10 % Giemsa. For each dose point 100 metaphases were analysed. For both PBL and hTERT-RPE 1 cells, cell cycle analysis using EdU Flow Cytometry Assay Kits (Invitrogen) was performed. Results: Our preliminary data show that I- 125 -UdR primarily induce <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations.</b> An enhanced level of aberrations was observed at already 100 accumulated decays per cell, whereof one decay per cell per 20 min was calculated. The cell cycle of both PBL and hTERT-RPE 1 cell line are delayed due to incorporation of I- 125 -UdR in the DNA, when compared to control cells. Conclusions: I- 125 -UdR posses a strong genotoxic capacity in PBL and hTERT-RPE 1 cells even at very low numbers of accumulated decays per cell and hence at a very low dose rate (< 11 mGy/hour).

DNA-associated AEE induce cellular damage leading to high-LET-type cell survival curves and possess enhanced relative biological effectiveness. They are presumed to cause complex DNA lesions as well. To elucidate the genotoxic potential of DNA-associated AEE, chromosomal/chromatid aberrations were analyzed in Iodine- 125 -deoxyuridine (I- 125 -UdR) exposed human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and in human telomerase-immortalized retinal pigment epithelial cells (hTERT-RPE 1).

40|$|After {{exposure}} of mammalian cells to DNA damage, the endogenous Rad 51 recombination protein {{is concentrated in}} multiple discrete foci, which are thought to represent nuclear domains for recombinational DNA repair. Overexpressed Rad 51 protein forms foci and higher-order nuclear structures, {{even in the absence}} of DNA damage, in cells that do not undergo DNA replication synthesis. This correlates with increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p 21. Following DNA damage, constitutively Rad 51 -overexpressing cells show reduced numbers of DNA breaks and <b>chromatid-type</b> chromosome <b>aberrations</b> and a greater resistance to apoptosis. In contrast, Rad 51 antisense inhibition reduces p 21 protein levels and sensitizes cells to etoposide treatment. Downregulation of p 21 inhibits Rad 51 foci formation in both normal and Rad 51 -overexpressing cells. Collectively, our results show that Rad 51 expression, Rad 51 foci formation and p 21 expression are interrelated, suggesting a functional link between mammalian Rad 51 protein and p 21 -mediated cell cycle regulation. This mechanism may contribute to a highly effective recombinational DNA repair in cell cycle-arrested cells and protection against DNA damage-induced apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: DNA-associated Auger-electron {{emitters}} (AEE) cause cellular damage {{leading to}} high-LET type cell survival curves indicating an enhanced relative biological effectiveness. DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by Iodine- 125 -deoxyuridine (I- 125 -UdR) decays are {{claimed to be}} very complex. To elucidate the assumed genotoxic potential of DNA-associated AEE, chromosome aberrations were analyzed in I- 125 -UdR-exposed human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Methods: PBL were isolated from whole blood and stimulated with chromosome medium containing phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). After 24 h cultures were labelled with I- 125 -UdR for 18 h (activity concentration 1 – 45 kBq) during the S-phase. Following standard cytogenetic procedure, at least 100 metaphases were analyzed microscopically for each activity concentration. Cell death was measured by apoptosis assay using flow cytometry. Radiation doses were determined by using point kernel calculations. Results: After 18 h labeling with I- 125 -UdR the cell cycle distribution is severely disturbed. About 40 % of PBL are fully labeled and 20 % show a moderate labeling of I- 125 -UdR, whereas 40 % of cells remain unlabeled. I- 125 -UdR primarily induces <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations.</b> The dose-response relationship fits well to a polynomial curve in the low dose range, whereas a linear fit supplies a better estimation in the high dose range. Even the lowest dose of 0. 2 Gy leads to significant damage and to a 13 -fold increase of aberrations compared to the controls. On average every fifth I- 125 -decay produces a single chromatid aberration in PBL. In addition, a dose-dependent increase of cell death is observed. Conclusions: I- 125 -UdR {{has a very strong}} genotoxic capacity in human PBL even at very low cellular doses of about 0. 2 Gy. Efficiently labeled cells displaying a prolonged cell cycle compared to moderately labeled cells and cell death contribute substantially to the desynchronisation of the cell cycle. Our data, showing that one I- 125 -decay induces  0. 2 chromatid aberrations, are in very good accordance to the data of Sedelnikova [1] and Yasui [2] who found  0. 26 DSB per decay, indicating that approximately every DSB is converted into a chromatid aberration.

DNA dsb induced by Iodine- 125 -deoxyuridine (I- 125 -UdR) decays are {{claimed to be}} very complex, thus efficiently leading to cell transformation, gene mutation and induction of chromatid aberrations. To elucidate the assumed genotoxic potential of DNA-associated AEE, chromosomal/chromatid aberrations were analyzed in I- 125 -UdR-exposed human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Methods: PBL were isolated from whole blood and stimulated with chromosome medium containing phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). After 24 h cultures were labeled with I- 125 -UdR for 18 h (0. 25 - 4. 5 kBq/ml) during the S-phase of the cell cycle. After removal of radioactive medium and washing steps, cells were re-cultured in stimulation medium for further 24 h. Colcemid was added 5. 5 h before harvest of cells followed by fixation for aberrations at 71. 5 h post-stimulation. All slides were stained with 10 % Giemsa, and 100 metaphases were analyzed microscopically for each dose point. Results: After 18 h labeling with I- 125 -UdR the cell cycle distribution is severely disturbed. Furthermore, 40 % of PBL are fully labelled and 20 % show a moderate uptake of I- 125 -UdR. I- 125 -UdR primarily induces <b>chromatid-type</b> <b>aberrations.</b> PBL reveal a very broad dose-dependent response spectrum: equal numbers of cells have either no aberration, or display a moderate aberration level (1 - 9 aberrations). Few cells exhibit a high aberration score (> 10 aberrations). A dose-dependent increase of aberrations is measured {{in the range of}} 0. 2 to 2 Gy, followed by a plateau between 2 and 4. 5 Gy. The data indicate that even the lowest dose of 0. 2 Gy leads to significant damage in PBL and to a 4. 5 -fold increase of aberrations compared to the controls. Furthermore, a dose-dependent increase of cell death is observed. Conclusions: I- 125 -UdR has a very strong genotoxic capacity in human PBL even at very low doses of about 0. 2 Gy. Efficiently labeled cells displaying a prolonged cell cycle compared to moderate labeled cells, and cell death contribute substantially to the desynchronisation of the cell cycle.
