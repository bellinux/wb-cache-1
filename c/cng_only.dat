40|$|There are {{different}} ways to transport natural gas. One way is to cool it to a temperature of - 162 °C and transport it in liquefied form (LNG). This is both a well known and often used method in the shipping industry. It is also possible to compress the natural gas (CNG) and contain it in cylinders / bottles. The development of the latter has only recently begun, and for now, the only real option {{when it comes to}} transportation of gas at sea is LNG. Nevertheless, the concept of CNG is still very interesting because it has the capability of reaching stranded gas reservoirs. Whereas exploitation of these areas using vessels transporting LNG would be far too expensive, shipping companies have with the introduction of CNG developed a much more cost-effective and less time consuming method. CNG has been discussed within the shipping industry since the 1960 s, but it is recently that the technology has become sufficiently developed. It is only just now that one has obtained the means to finance the project and been able to make it profitable. Unfortunately, since <b>CNG</b> <b>only</b> exists in theory and on paper, the regulatory framework around the concept is not completely developed. In an attempt to explain the CNG concept, I will therefore look at not only the technical, but also the economical and legal aspects concerning the subject. In this paper I will show {{that there is a need}} for CNG and that it is a better economical alternative to the LNG system when it comes to transporting gas over shorter distances. I will also show that although well known international classification societies, such as Det Norske Veritas (DNV) and American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), have developed their own CNG standards it does not mean that the concept is also covered by the mandatory international regulations produced by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). After analysing the legislations of several international maritime conventions and codes, I will demonstrate that there exists a definition problem in the different conventions and that CNG falls outside the scope of some of the most significant codes. I will firstly evoke the technical aspect of the concept by considering the need for this new type of innovation, before I look into the differences between CNG and LNG to verify the cost-effectiveness of the two methods of transportation. The Norwegian shipping company Knutsen OAS is currently developing a CNG vessel and it will therefore be used as an example to illustrate how the system works in practice. The papers fifth section examines if the international maritime classification societies have acknowledged the CNG concept and what the consequences of this is. I will then look at IMO in the attempt to answer the question if CNG is in compliance with the international conventions SOLAS and MARPOL, before I look into the problems of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods code (IMDG) and the more important International Gas Carrier code (IGC). This is important whereas to the survival of CNG. Finally I will also take into consideration the legal aspects of liability using the Harmful and Noxious Substances convention (HNS) ...|$|E

We examined why HCN and certain CNG subunits form functional homomeric channels, whereas other <b>CNG</b> subunits <b>only</b> function in heteromeric channels. The “defect” in the CNGA 4 subunit that prevents its homomeric expression was localized to its C-linker, which connects the transmembrane domain to the binding domain and contains a tripeptide that decreases the efficacy of ligand gating. Remarkably, replacement of the homologous HCN tripeptide with the CNGA 4 sequence transformed cAMP into an inverse agonist that inhibits HCN channel opening. Using analytical ultracentrifugation, we identified the structural basis for this gating switch: whereas cAMP normally enhances the assembly of HCN C-terminal domains into a tetrameric gating ring, inclusion of the CNGA 4 tripeptide reversed this action so that cAMP now causes gating ring disassembly. Thus, ligand gating depends on the dynamic oligomerization of C-terminal binding domains...|$|R

The figure illustrates why a given CAG repeat is located either entirely within the loop or entirely within the duplex domain. Loop migration in steps of 3 bases maintains the alignment of CAG repeats within the bulge loop and maintains stable CG/GC base pairs closing the loop domain. By contrast, loop migration via single base steps would result in altered alignments of bases within the loop domain, which would disrupt those intra loop interactions that make CNG repeats unusually stable. Single base steps also would cause less stable base pairs to close the loop domain (CG/AT, {{in the case of}} 1 step, AT/GC in case of 2 base steps).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} the cost-effectiveness, {{in terms of}} reducing greenhouse gas emissions, of increasing the {{corporate average fuel economy}} (CAFE) standard to 38 miles per gallon and substituting methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), and reformulated gasoline for conventional gasoline. Greenhouse gas emissions are assessed over the entire fuel cycle and include carbon dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide emissions. To account for joint environmental benefits, the cost per ton of greenhouse gas reduced is adjusted for reductions in volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, an ozone precursor. CNG is found to be the most cost-effective of these alternatives, followed by increasing the CAFE standard, substituting methanol for gasoline, and substituting reformulated for conventional gasoline. Including the VOC benefits does not change the ranking of the alternatives, bug does make the alternative fuels look better relative to increasing the CAFE standard.

40|$|Human {{olfaction}} {{comprises the}} opposing actions of excitation and inhibition triggered by odorant molecules. In olfactory receptor neurons, odorant molecules not only trigger a G-protein–coupled signaling cascade but also generate various mechanisms to fine tune the odorant-induced current, including a low-selective odorant inhibition of the olfactory signal. This wide-range olfactory inhibition {{has been suggested}} {{to be at the}} level of ion channels, but definitive evidence is not available. Here, we report that the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) cation channel, which is a key element that converts odorant stimuli into electrical signals, is inhibited by structurally unrelated odorants, consistent with the expression of wide-range olfactory inhibition. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect was small in the homo-oligomeric <b>CNG</b> channel composed <b>only</b> of the principal channel subunit, CNGA 2, but became larger in channels consisting of multiple types of subunits. However, even in the channel containing all native subunits, the potency of the suppression on the cloned CNG channel appeared to be smaller than that previously shown in native olfactory neurons. Nonetheless, our results further showed that odorant suppressions are small in native neurons if the subsequent molecular steps mediated by Ca 2 + are removed. Thus, the present work also suggests that CNG channels switch on and off the olfactory signaling pathway, and that the on and off signals may both be amplified by the subsequent olfactory signaling steps...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{found that}} native cyclic nucleotide–gated (CNG) cation channels from amphibian rod cells are directly and reversibly inhibited by analogues of diacylglycerol (DAG), but {{little is known}} about the mechanism of this inhibition. We recently determined that, at saturating cGMP concentrations, DAG completely inhibits cloned bovine rod (Brod) <b>CNG</b> channels while <b>only</b> partially inhibiting cloned rat olfactory (Rolf) channels (Crary, J. I., D. M. Dean, W. Nguitragool, P. T. Kurshan, and A. L. Zimmerman. 2000. J. Gen. Phys. 116 : 755 – 768; in this issue). Here, we report that a point mutation at position 204 in the S 2 –S 3 loop of Rolf and a mouse CNG channel (Molf) found in olfactory epithelium and heart, increased DAG sensitivity to that of the Brod channel. Mutation of this residue from the wild-type glycine to a glutamate (Molf G 204 E) or aspartate (Molf G 204 D) gave dramatic increases in DAG sensitivity without changing the apparent cGMP or cAMP affinities or efficacies. However, unlike the wild-type olfactory channels, these mutants demonstrated voltage-dependent gating with obvious activation and deactivation kinetics. Interestingly, the mutants were also more sensitive to inhibition by the local anesthetic, tetracaine. Replacement of the position 204 glycine with a tryptophan residue (Rolf G 204 W) not only gave voltage-dependent gating and an increased sensitivity to DAG and tetracaine, but also showed reduced apparent agonist affinity and cAMP efficacy. Sequence comparisons show that the glycine at position 204 in the S 2 –S 3 loop is highly conserved, and our findings indicate that its alteration can have critical consequences for channel gating and inhibition...|$|R
40|$|Italy {{is a large}} {{producer}} of biogas from anaerobic digestion, which is mainly used for power generation with limited use of cogenerated heat. Other utilization pathways, such as biomethane injection into the natural gas grid or biomethane used as a vehicle fuel, remain unexplored. Given the dense grid of natural gas pipelines and existing Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) refueling stations in northern Italy, significant market opportunities for biogas could also arise in the heating and transport sectors. The main objectives of this paper are to explore the potential role of agricultural biogas in different utilization pathways. Biogas combustion for simultaneous production of heat and power in small Combined Heat and Power (CHP) facilities is also assessed, as is upgrading to biomethane for transport or natural gas grid injection {{in the specific context}} of northern Italy. The spatially explicit optimization model BeWhere is used to identify optimal locations where greenfield biogas plants could be installed and to determine the most economic and environmentally beneficial mix of conversion technologies and plant capacities. Carbon price, for instance in the form of tradable emission permits, is assessed as a policy instrument and compared with other options such as price premiums on biomethane or electricity costs. Results show that starting from a carbon price of 15 EUR/tCO(2), the cogeneration option is preferable if plants are located in the proximity of existing district heating infrastructure. <b>CNG</b> plants are <b>only</b> competitive starting at a carbon price of 70 EUR/tCO(2) in areas with high feedstock availability. The sensitivity analysis for energy prices reveals that a larger number of CNG facilities are included in the optimal mix at higher gas wholesale prices.

40|$|Faghri, ArdeshirThe Energy Policy Act of 1992 {{motivated}} transit {{agencies to}} utilize alternative-fuel transit buses {{in addition to}} their popular diesel buses. The Delaware Authority for Regional Transit (DART) has also planned to add a significant number of alternative-fuel buses to its current transit fleet. This study has been defined to assist the DART administration to make an optimal decision in this regard. The information used in this study was gathered from the latest scientific and practical reports published by Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP), National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It also combined with the knowledge that the author gained from two major recent conferences related to public transportation; 1) BusCon 2009 in Chicago, Illinois, and 2) APTA annual meeting 2009 in Orlando, FL. Among eight alternative-fuel buses introduced by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, this study recognized that only Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), biodiesel, and hybrid-diesel buses can be considered as the viable alternatives for the Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) transit buses. For each of these technologies Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) and emissions are estimated and compared with the available information for the ULSD buses. The LCC consists of capital cost and operating cost. The capital cost includes initial purchasing cost and infrastructure cost which is separated in two subsections, refueling station and depot modification. The operating cost includes fuel cost, total maintenance cost, facility (refueling station and depot) maintenance cost, compression electricity cost (applicable to <b>CNG</b> buses <b>only),</b> and battery replacement cost (applicable to hybrid diesel-electric buses only). The results show that buses propelled by hybrid-diesel engine have the least LCC ($/mile). Alternatives were ranked with respect to their capital cost as follows: 1) ULSD, 2) Biodiesel, 3) Hybrid diesel-electric, and 4) CNG. The ranks of alternatives changed with respect to their operating cost and it was as follows: 1) CNG, 2) Hybrid diesel-electric, 3) ULSD, and 4) Biodiesel. Although all the alternative-fuel buses meet the latest EPA emissions standard, the recent scientific reports prove that hybrid diesel-electric buses emit fewer air pollutants than their counterparts. This characteristic also gives hybrid buses an edge to consider as the most suitable alternative-fuel buses for DART. This study found that CNG buses are the strongest competitor for the hybrid diesel-electric buses. The major problem with CNG buses for being utilized by DART is their cost of implementation. The infrastructure (refueling stations and depot modification) cost of CNG buses is very high. This issue gets worse because DART demands more than one infrastructure to be able to operate CNG buses throughout the state of Delaware. Also, DART needs to wait until the required infrastructures have been built meaning that the readiness index of CNG technology for DART is very low. This study also conducted an expert survey {{in order to determine the}} relative importance of other criteria on the transit fleet expansion plan. Four major goals and twelve criteria were defined. A questionnaire was designed and distributed among the relevant decision-making experts from governmental agencies, bus manufactures, academic organizations, energy suppliers, and research institutes. They assessed the relative importance (subjectively) for each of the criteria. The collected data shows that energy independence criterion is the most important factor in evaluating the alternative-fuel buses; second in importance are energy availability and safety; third is energy efficiency, indicating the need for new alternative-fuel buses. The survey also asked the respondents to rank the alternatives regarding each criterion. Based on the results, hybrid diesel-buses were ranked first in six criteria including energy availability, safety, energy efficiency, air pollution, noise pollution, and sense of comfort. Hybrid diesel-electric buses also were ranked second in two criteria including energy independence and cost of implementation. These buses were only ranked lowest with respect to the cost of maintenance criterion. However, this observation is not supported by our estimation and comparative analysis reports published by other organizations. The expert survey results clearly show that ULSD buses are the most reliable and capable alternative among other technologies. These buses were also ranked first with respect to the cost of implementation and cost of maintenance criteria. However, ULSD buses were ranked third and fourth (lowest) with respect to the most important criteria including energy independence, and energy efficiency. These buses were also assumed to perform poorly with respect to noise pollution, sense of comfort, and air pollution criteria. This study concludes that hybrid diesel-electric buses rate well according to the criteria of energy, environmental impact, industrial relationship, and implementation cost for DART. The results of this study also confirm that each transit agency needs to consider its unique characteristics and facilities before deciding what alternative-fuel bus to invest in. Two major reasons that support this conclusion are 1) Capital cost varies based upon facilities that transit agencies already have in place, and 2) Even for one transit agency, the best option may change based upon the number of buses that will be acquired. Life-cycle cost is sensitive to the number of buses that will be purchased. However, transit agencies can use other transit agencies experience or studies such as this thesis to perform their own study.

40|$|Ion {{channels}} are allosteric proteins that play a fundamental role for cells; they regulate ion fluxes across biological membranes by residing {{in any of}} three functionally distinct states: deactivated (closed), activated (open) or inactivated (closed). In addition to selecting permeant ions, channels undergo conformational changes that open and close their ion-permeable pores, a process referred to as gating. On {{the basis of their}} primary structure the ion {{channels are}} classified into {{a relatively small number of}} discrete gene families. Cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) and hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN), together with K+, Na+, Ca 2 + and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels belong to the superfamily of voltage gated channels. All members of this family are tetrameric or pseudotetrameric and share a common pore domain that contains two transmembrane (TM) segments - referred to as M 1 and M 2, or S 5 and S 6. As in all the voltage-gated channels, CNG channels have four additional TM segments per subunit: S 1 –S 4 that, correspond to the sensor for the allosteric modulation of gating by membrane voltage. CNG channels are mainly activated by binding of cyclic nucleotides, but, in the presence of symmetrical ionic conditions, current-voltage (I-V) relationship depends, in a complex way, on the radius of permeating ion and has been suggested that both the pore and S 4 helix contribute to the observed rectification. CNG channels are essential for visual and olfactory transduction: in rod photoreceptors CNG channels open in dark conditions and are responsible for a steady inward current that flows through them keeping the membrane depolarized. In vertebrates, seven members of the CNG channel gene family have been identified that, according to sequence similarity, are grouped into two subtypes, CNGA (CNGA 1 -CNGA 5) and CNGB (CNGB 1 and CNGB 3). Only CNGA subunits - except the A 4 subunit - can form cyclic nucleotide-activated homomeric channels, while CNGB 1 and CNGB 3 are modulatory and cannot form functional homomeric channels. <b>CNG</b> channels are <b>only</b> slightly voltage-dependent and, for opening, require the binding of cGMP or cAMP to a receptor site located in their C-terminal. In the presence of a saturating agonist, CNG channel gating is voltage independent and it is not known why CNG channels are voltage-insensitive despite harbouring the S 4 -type voltage sensor. Moreover, unlike many K+ channels, cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels are known not to inactivate. While electrophysiology combined with mutagenesis have identified the channel pore and the binding domain for cyclic nucleotides (CNs), conformational changes associated with gating have remained elusive. During my PhD course I focused my energies on investigating the structural and functional properties of different domains of the CNGA 1 channels, combining results from different techniques like homology modelling, single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and X-ray crystallography with my own data from electrophysiology and site-directed mutagenesis in order to get better insights of fundamental properties of the channels, like permeation and channel gating. The main findings of my PhD thesis are the following: I. 	I showed that current rectification, in presence of large organic cations, like ethylammonium and dimethylammonium, strongly depends on two voltage-dependent transitions, of which, only the first, is sensible to mutation of charge residues in the S 4 helix. These results indicate the existence of at least two distinct mechanisms underlying rectification in CNG channels: a restricted motion of the S 4 helix, together with an inefficient coupling to the channel gate that render CNGA 1 channels poorly sensitive to voltage in the presence of physiological Na+ and K+. II. 	has been demonstrated that, contrary to previous belief, when extracellular pH is decreased from 7. 4 to 6 or lower, wild-type CNGA 1 channels inactivate in a voltage-dependent manner. This mechanism is reminiscent of the C-type inactivation observed in K+ channels. Low pH inactivation may represent an unrecognized endogenous mechanism that regulate CNG physiological functions in diverse tissues. III. 	combining electrophysiology with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and X-ray crystallography has been demonstrated that the pore of CNG channels is highly flexible and, mainly due to the side chain of Glu 66 in the selectivity filter and to the prolines in the outer vestibule, capable to coordinate different ionic species. This flexibility underlies the coupling between gating and permeation and the poor ionic selectivity of CNG channels. IV. 	by mean of electrophysiology combined with single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), mutagenesis and bioinformatics have been obtained better insights about conformational changes associated with gating and, in particular, about the mechanical coupling between the voltage sensor and the binding domain. We revealed putative electrostatic interactions between an aspartate in the C-linker and an arginine in the S 4 -S 5 linker. We hypothesized a possible mechanism, possibly shared with HCN channels, by which these electrostatic interactions determine the motion of S 5, leading to conformational rearrangements of residues flanking the pore so that the lumen of the pore widens and the channel opens...|$|R
