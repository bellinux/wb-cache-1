50|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>cold</b> <b>saw</b> blades is increasing {{due to the}} technological advancements in <b>cold</b> <b>saw</b> machines. They are the sawing method of choice when high production requirements are needed. They consistently produce the lowest cost per cut among all sawing methods: hot sawing, friction sawing, bandsawing and hacksawing.|$|E
50|$|The {{second type}} of <b>cold</b> <b>saw</b> blade, {{tungsten}} carbide-tipped (TCT), are made with an alloy steel body and tungsten carbide inserts brazed to {{the tips of the}} teeth. These tips are ground on all surfaces to create tangential and radial clearance and provide the proper cutting and clearance angles on the teeth. The alloy body is generally made from a wear-resistant material such as a chrome vanadium steel, heat treated to 38/42 HRC. The tungsten carbide tips are capable of operating at much higher temperatures than solid HSS, therefore, TCT saw blades are usually run at much higher surface speeds. This allows carbide-tipped blades to cut at faster rates and still maintain an acceptable chip load per tooth. These blades are commonly used for cutting non-ferrous alloys, but have gained significant popularity for ferrous metal cutting applications in the last 10 years. The tungsten carbide inserts are extremely hard (98 HRC) and capable of very long wear life. However, they are less resistant to shock than solid HSS <b>cold</b> <b>saw</b> blades. Any vibration during the cutting process may severely damage the teeth. These <b>cold</b> <b>saw</b> blades need to be driven by a backlash free gear box and a constant feed mechanism like a ball-screw feed.|$|E
5000|$|Linear {{cutting tools}} include tool bits (single-point cutting tools) and broaches. Rotary cutting tools include drill bits, {{countersinks}} and counterbores, taps and dies, milling cutters, reamers, and <b>cold</b> <b>saw</b> blades. Other cutting tools, such as bandsaw blades, hacksaw blades, and fly cutters, combine aspects of linear and rotary motion ...|$|E
50|$|The name carbide saw {{came from}} the tool, a {{circular}} saw blade, with silver soldered carbide tips. It competed with and just about replaced, solid or segmental HSS blades, because carbide is much harder than HSS. Before HSS saws were developed, abrasive, friction or hot saws were used and are still manufactured for certain applications. These processes create heat and are therefore called hot saws. However, HSS blades use coolant and the cut surfaces don’t get hot, thus called <b>cold</b> <b>saws.</b> With the unique geometry of the teeth of carbide circular saws, the heat, developed by the cutting process is transferred into the chips and carried away with the chips. The cut surfaces stay cool. Therefore, carbide saws were also called <b>cold</b> <b>saws.</b> Other names include <b>cold</b> cut <b>saws,</b> <b>cold</b> circular <b>saws,</b> <b>cold</b> cut off <b>saws</b> or circular <b>cold</b> <b>saws.</b>|$|R
50|$|Portable <b>cold</b> <b>saws</b> were {{primarily}} designed for sheet metal roofers {{in the building}} industry, and can cut up to 6 mm thick mild steel. <b>Cold</b> <b>saws,</b> as opposed to abrasive saws, are used so that protective coating is not damaged. They have a heavy duty aluminium catcher which is useful for capturing the swarf, and use cermet tipped blades.|$|R
25|$|Power hacksaws (with {{reciprocating}} blades) {{were once}} {{common in the}} metalworking industries, but bandsaws and <b>cold</b> <b>saws</b> have mostly displaced them.|$|R
5000|$|The first type of <b>cold</b> <b>saw</b> blade, solid HSS, may be {{made from}} either M2 tool steel or M35 tool steel, alloyed with {{additional}} cobalt. Solid HSS saw blades are heat treated and hardened to 64/65 HRC for ferrous cutting applications and 58/60 HRC for non-ferrous cutting applications. This high hardness gives the cutting edges of the teeth a high resistance to heat and wear. However, this increased hardness also makes the blades brittle and not very resistant to shock. In order to produce a high quality HSS <b>cold</b> <b>saw</b> blade, you must start with very flat and properly tensioned raw material. The blades must be press quenched after hardening {{to prevent them from}} being ed. HSS saw blades are typically hollow ground for clearance during the cutting process. The term HSS doesn't necessarily mean what it implies. These blades are usually never run at surface speeds higher than 350 SFM. Solid HSS <b>cold</b> <b>saw</b> blades may be used for cutting many different shapes and types of metal including: tubes, extrusions, structural sections, billets, bars, ingots, castings, forgings etc. These blades may also be coated with special wear resistant coatings such as titanium nitride (TiN) or titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN), but are more commonly used commercially with a black Oxide coating aiding in better coolant distribution over the surface area of the cutting blade.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>saw</b> blades are {{circular}} {{metal cutting}} saw blades categorized into two types: solid HSS or tungsten carbide-tipped (TCT). Both types of blades are resharpenable {{and may be}} used many times before being discarded. <b>Cold</b> <b>saw</b> blades are used to cut metal using a relatively slow rotational speed, usually less than 5000 surface feet per minute (SFM) (25m/s), and a high chip load per tooth, usually between [...]001" [...] - [...]003" [...] (0.025 - 0.08mm) per tooth. These blades are driven by a high power motor and high-torque gear reduction unit or an AC vector drive. During the cutting process, the metal is released in a shearing action by the teeth as the blade turns and the feed mechanism moves the blade forward. They are called [...] "cold saw blades" [...] because they transfer all the energy and heat created during the cutting process to the chip. This enables the blade and the work material to remain cold.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>cold</b> <b>saw</b> is a {{circular}} saw designed to cut metal {{which uses a}} toothed blade to transfer the heat generated by cutting to the chips created by the saw blade, allowing both the blade and material being cut to remain cool. This is contrast to an abrasive saw, which abrades the metal and generates {{a great deal of}} heat absorbed by the material being cut and saw blade.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>saws</b> {{use either}} a solid {{high speed steel}} (HSS) or {{tungsten}} carbide-tipped, resharpenable circular saw blade. They are equipped {{with an electric motor}} and a gear reduction unit to reduce the saw blade's rotational speed while maintaining constant torque. This allows the HSS saw blade to feed at a constant rate with a very high chip load per tooth.|$|R
50|$|Power hacksaws {{are not as}} {{commonly}} used in the metalworking industries as they once were. Bandsaws and <b>cold</b> <b>saws</b> have mostly displaced them. While stationary electric hacksaws are not very common, they are still produced. Power hacksaws of the type powered by stationary engines and line shafts, like other line-shaft-powered machines, are now rare; museums and antique-tool hobbyists still preserve a few of them.|$|R
50|$|Chain brakes prevent {{movement}} of the saw's cutting chain by applying a steel brake band around the driven clutch drum. Clamping force for the brake band is provided by a powerful spring. The chain brake has two purposes. First, {{it can be used}} to secure the chain when changing position, moving between cuts or starting a <b>cold</b> <b>saw,</b> which requires a partly open throttle. This would otherwise lead to uncontrolled chain movement, a major hazard in older saws. Secondly, the chainbrake can activate under kickback conditions to prevent the operator from being struck by a running chain. Being struck by even a static chain may cause serious injury, but anything that can be done to mitigate the usually dreadful injuries caused by contact with a moving chain is of considerable benefit to operators. Kickback injuries usually occur to the head, face, neck and shoulders; when a running chain is involved, such injuries are usually very serious, often disfiguring and sometimes fatal.|$|E

50|$|Since their introduction, {{portable}} cut-off saws {{have made}} many building site jobs easier. With these saws, lightweight steel fabrication previously performed in workshops using stationary power bandsaws or <b>cold</b> <b>saws</b> {{can be done}} on-site. Abrasive saws have replaced more expensive and hazardous acetylene torches in many applications, such as cutting rebar. In addition, these saws allow construction workers to cut through concrete, asphalt, and pipe on job sites in a more precise manner than is possible with heavy equipment.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>saws</b> {{are capable}} of {{machining}} most ferrous and non-ferrous alloys. Additional advantages include minimal burr production, fewer sparks, less discoloration and no dust. Saws designed to employ a flood coolant system to keep saw blade teeth cooled and lubricated may reduce sparks and discoloration completely. Saw blade type and number of teeth, cutting speed, and feed rate all must be appropriate to the type and size of material being cut, which must be mechanically clamped to prevent movement during the cutting process.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970 the US {{government}} {{defense department}} {{learned of the}} development of the new saw concept. Chamberlain Manufacturing Corporation, contracted by Frankford Arsenal (...) , has conducted an evaluation of the Goellner carbide billet saw. Chamberlain issued a comprehensive technical report on May, 29 1970. The report concluded that the new sawing concept was superior to the conventional band <b>sawing,</b> <b>cold</b> <b>sawing</b> and other billet severing methods in numerous objectives. Proclaimed advantages included faster cutting speeds, long blade life and improved quality of cutoff interfaces.|$|R

50|$|In 1973, Metalcut {{developed}} the first carbide rail saw which was later produced by other companies including Wagner.In 1997, AME developed an economical rail saw under {{the brand name}} AMSAW 300-R, which is still widely used throughout the U.S.In 1999, AME built a special model of a carbide saw for mitercutting railroad rails for frogs and switches.In 2011, AME develops a special model which is integrated as a double saw in a railroad car and used for repair work of railroad tracks in the USA. It replaced abrasive saws which had been used before. These abrasive saws were guilty of causing forest fires due the hot chips and sparks. Consequently, these hazardous machines were replaced with AMSAW <b>cold</b> <b>saws.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>saw(ing)</b> {{machines}} are circular saws {{that are used}} in many metal cutting operations. The saw blades used are quite large in diameter and operate at low rotational speeds, and linear feeds. There are three common types of blades used in circular saws; solid-tooth, segmental tooth, and the carbide inserted-tooth. The circular saw is typically fed into the workpiece horizontally, and as the saw advances into the material, it severs the material by producing narrow slots. The material is usually held in place during the cutting operation by means of a vise. The chips produced by cutting are carried away from the material by both the teeth of the blade as well as the coolant or other cutting fluid used.|$|R
