5000|$|In some countries, {{the terms}} caller display, <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> {{identification}} presentation (CLIP), call capture, or just <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> identity are used; call display is the predominant marketing name used in Canada (although some customers still {{refer to it}} colloquially as [...] "caller ID"). The idea of CNID as a service for POTS subscribers originated from automatic number identification (ANI) {{as a part of}} toll free number service in the United States.|$|E

50|$|Caller ID (caller {{identification}}, CID), {{also called}} <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> identification (CLID), calling number delivery (CND), calling number identification (CNID), <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> identification presentation (CLIP), or call display, is a telephone service, available in analog and digital telephone systems, including VoIP, that transmits a caller's telephone number to the called party's telephone equipment {{when the call}} is being set up. The caller ID service may include the transmission of a name associated with the calling telephone number. This service is called CNAM.|$|E

50|$|Similarly, some {{countries}} offer anonymous caller rejection, which rejects all calls when the subscriber's name, number (or both) is blocked. Some telephone companies protect their clients from receiving blocked information by routing anonymous calls to a service (such as AT&T Privacy Manager), where {{the caller is}} required to announce himself or herself. The service then asks the called party {{if they want to}} accept or reject the call. Other telephone companies play a recording to the caller advising them of the called party's rejection configuration, and often offer advice (such as prefixing their dialing with *82) on how to get their call to the intended called party. Blocking the number is referred to as <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> identification restriction (CLIR). Emergency services will most likely be able to show the restricted number using a service called <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> identification restriction override (CLIRO), or by using general ANI services.|$|E
50|$|CLI {{localisation}} {{describes the}} process of presenting a localised CLI (<b>Calling</b> <b>Line</b> Identity) to the recipient of a telephone call. CLI localisation is utilised by various organisations, including call centres, debt collectors and insurance companies. CLI localisation allows companies to increase their contact rate by increasing the chance that a called party will answer a phone call. Because a localised CLI is displayed on the called party's device, the call is perceived as local and recognisable to the caller.|$|E
50|$|A call placed {{behind a}} private branch {{exchange}} (PBX) has more options. In the typical telephony environment, a PBX connects to the local service provider through Primary Rate Interface (PRI) trunks. Generally, although not absolutely, the service provider simply passes whatever <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> ID appears on those PRI access trunks transparently across the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). This opens up the opportunity for the PBX administrator to program whatever number they choose in their external phone number fields.|$|E

50|$|Re-origination or Refiling is {{the name}} given to the {{practice}} of substituting a new <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> identity (CLI) for the call at some point in its journey. Re-origination is made possible by exploiting the functionality of the SS7 signaling system, which allows a great deal of call information to be transmitted. In principle the receiving telecoms company can inspect the CLI to see where the call has come from and charge accordingly. In practice, switches are able to remove or change the CLI, thus disguising the origin of the call.|$|E
5000|$|Some IP phone {{services}} (ITSPs, or Internet Telephony Service Providers) support PSTN gateway installations {{throughout the}} world. These gateways egress {{calls to the}} local calling area, thus avoiding long distance toll charges. ITSPs also allow a local user to have a number located in a [...] "foreign" [...] exchange; the New York caller could have a Los Angeles number, for example. When that user places a call, the <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> ID would be that of a Los Angeles number, although they are actually located in New York. This allows a call return without having to incur long distance calling charges.|$|E
50|$|This Vertical Service Code, *82, enables <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> {{identification}} {{regardless of}} subscriber preference, dialed to unblock withheld numbers (private callers) in the U.S. on a per-call basis. If Caller ID is subscribed to or enabled {{on the line}} receiving the call, the unblocked phone number and registered name is displayed - unable to determine that the caller subscribes to outgoing callerID blocking or that *82 has been dialed to temporarily override that subscription. *82 can be dialed from U.S. land-line house phones and business lines, {{as well as most}} cell phones and mobile devices. Some mobile devices may alternatively offer or require a menu selection to override Caller ID blocking per call.|$|E

50|$|Most modern non-VoIP PBXs use ISDN-PRI circuits. These are {{connected}} via T1 lines {{with the central}} office switch, replacing older analog two-way and direct inward dialing (DID) trunks. PRI is capable of delivering <b>Calling</b> <b>Line</b> Identification (CLID) in both directions so that the telephone number of an extension, rather than a companys main number, can be sent. It is still commonly used in recording studios, when a voice-over actor is in one studio (possibly telecommuting from home), but the director and producer are in a studio at another location. The ISDN protocol delivers channelized, not-over-the-Internet service, powerful call setup and routing features, faster setup and tear down, superior audio fidelity as compared to POTS (plain old telephone service), lower delay and, at higher densities, lower cost.|$|E
5000|$|To {{connect the}} allotted {{registers}} to the <b>calling</b> <b>line,</b> the MCU asked the interrogator-markers to identify all free paths from the subscriber to the central, [...] "through" [...] type, links {{and from the}} register to the links. This information was returned to the Route Choice Unit, which then identified those link circuits, which were available to both peripheral terminals, and selected the most suitable, according to predetermined rules chosen to make maximum use of the network. Its decision was signalled back to the MCU which then instructed the interrogator-markers to mark the chosen pair of paths, starting from the link out through the C, B and A stages to the subscriber, and then {{from the other side}} of the same link, through C, B and A-stages to the register.|$|E
5000|$|This type had two {{stepping}} coils with pawls and ratchets, one {{to raise}} the wipers to the desired banks of contacts, and one to rotate the wipers into the banks. These were commonly used in telephone switching with ten banks of ten contacts. The coils were typically driven by the electrical pulses derived from a rotary telephone dial. On a two-motion selector, as a digit was dialed, the wipers would step up the banks, then automatically rotate (self-step) into the selected bank until they found an [...] "unused" [...] outlet to the next switch stage. The last two digits dialed would operate the connector switch (final selector in Britain). The second to last digit would cause the wipers to move up and the last digit would cause them to rotate into the bank to the called customer's line outlet. If the line was idle then ringing voltage would {{be applied to the}} called line and ringing tone was sent to the <b>calling</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
