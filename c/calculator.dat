5|$|Blaise Pascal {{invented the}} {{mechanical}} <b>calculator</b> in 1642; {{it was the}} first operational adding machine. It made use of a gravity-assisted carry mechanism. It was the only operational mechanical <b>calculator</b> in the 17thcentury and the earliest automatic, digital computer. Pascal's <b>calculator</b> was limited by its carry mechanism, which forced its wheels to only turn one way so it could add. To subtract, the operator had to use the Pascal's calculator's complement, which required as many steps as an addition. Giovanni Poleni followed Pascal, building the second functional mechanical <b>calculator</b> in 1709, a calculating clock made of wood that, once setup, could multiply two numbers automatically.|$|E
5|$|The Programmer {{accessory}} {{had been}} {{mentioned in the}} earliest advertisement {{but it was not}} featured until March 1974. This was the same size as a desktop <b>calculator</b> and could hold 256 programming steps. (It could be expanded to 512 steps.) It was limited to emulating <b>calculator</b> key presses and simple sequence branching. The programming was done by entering hexadecimal key codes. The combination of the MITS 7440 <b>calculator</b> and the programmer was not nearly as sophisticated as the HP 9830 <b>calculator</b> but $400 for both kits was a fraction of the HP price.|$|E
5|$|The Sinclair Scientific <b>calculator</b> was a 12-function, pocket-sized {{scientific}} <b>calculator</b> {{introduced in}} 1974, dramatically undercutting in price other calculators {{available at the}} time.

5|$|Ed Roberts' {{interest}} in computers began {{in high school}} when he built a simple digital computer from relays. His first real experience with computers came while at Oklahoma State University where engineering students had free access to an IBM 1620 computer. Roberts' office at Weapons Laboratory had {{the state of the}} art Hewlett-Packard 9100A programmable <b>calculator</b> in 1968. In July 1970, a semiconductor company, Electronic Arrays, announced a set of six LSI ICs that would make a four-function <b>calculator.</b> Roberts was determined to design a <b>calculator</b> kit.|$|E
5|$|Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) was an American {{electronics}} company {{founded in}} Albuquerque, New Mexico that began manufacturing electronic calculators in 1971 and personal computers in 1975. Ed Roberts and Forrest Mims founded MITS in December 1969 to produce miniaturized telemetry modules for model rockets {{such as a}} roll rate sensor. In 1971, Roberts redirected the company into the electronic <b>calculator</b> market and the MITS 816 desktop <b>calculator</b> kit was featured on the November 1971 cover of Popular Electronics. The calculators were very successful and sales topped one million dollars in 1973. A brutal <b>calculator</b> price war left the company deeply in debt by 1974.|$|E
5|$|The {{steady flow}} of <b>calculator</b> sales allowed MITS to run full page {{advertisements}} in Radio-Electronics, Popular Electronics and Scientific American. In the June 1972 Radio-Electronics, MITS announced a 14 digit <b>calculator</b> (Model 1440) with memory and square root function for $199.95 kit and $249.95 assembled. The original 816 kit was reduced from $179 to $149.95. Both calculators could be controlled by upcoming programming unit.|$|E

5|$|To {{fund the}} new project, Roberts sold 15% of MITS to fellow Air Force officer, Lieutenant William Yates. He also got an {{investment}} from another Weapons Laboratory officer, Major Ed Laughlin. Several other officers and {{scientist at the}} lab were interested in this {{state of the art}} <b>calculator</b> kit and helped with the design.

5|$|From 1971 Texas Instruments {{had been}} making {{available}} the building block for a simple <b>calculator</b> on a single chip and the TMS0803 chipset appeared {{in a number of}} Sinclair calculators. Clive Sinclair wanted to design a <b>calculator</b> to compete with the HP-35 using this series of chips. Despite scepticism about the feasibility of the project from Texas Instruments engineers, Nigel Searle was able to design algorithms that sacrificed some speed and accuracy in order to implement scientific functions on the TMS0805 variation.|$|E

50|$|Some {{graphing}} <b>calculators</b> have {{a computer}} algebra system (CAS), {{which means that they}} are capable of producing symbolic results. These <b>calculators</b> can manipulate algebraic expressions, performing operations such as factor, expand, and simplify. In addition, they can give answers in exact form without numerical approximations. <b>Calculators</b> that {{have a computer}} algebra system are called symbolic or CAS <b>calculators.</b> Examples of symbolic <b>calculators</b> include the HP 50g, the HP Prime, the TI-89, the TI-Nspire CAS, and the Casio ClassPad.|$|R
50|$|Mental <b>calculators</b> were {{in great}} demand in {{research}} centers such as CERN {{before the advent}} of modern electronic <b>calculators</b> and computers. See, for instance, Steven B. Smith's 1983 book The Great Mental <b>Calculators.</b>|$|R
5|$|The HP-35 used five chips, {{and had a}} been {{developed}} by twenty engineers {{at a cost of}} a million dollars, leading the Texas Instruments engineers to think that Sinclair's aim to build a scientific <b>calculator</b> around the TMS0805 chip, which could barely handle four-function arithmetic, was impossible. However, by sacrificing some speed and accuracy, Sinclair used clever algorithms to run scientific operations on a chip with room for just 320 instructions. Constants, rather than being stored in the <b>calculator,</b> were printed under the screen.|$|E
5|$|The {{functionality}} of <b>calculator</b> ICs {{increased at}} a rapid pace and Roberts was designing and producing new models. The MITS 7400 scientific and engineering <b>calculator</b> was introduced in December 1972. It featured trigonometric functions, polar to rectangular conversion, two memories, and up to a seven-level stack. A kit with a three-level stack was $299.95 and an assembled unit with a seven-level stack was $419.95. The next month the Series 1200 four-function pocket calculators were announced. The six-digit model was $59.95 and the twelve-digit model was $99.95.|$|E
5|$|The inputs {{operated}} by the bomb-aimer's mate drove a mechanical <b>calculator</b> inside the console, or computor. The output of the <b>calculator</b> drove flexible shafts that rotated the sight head to the proper angles in azimuth and altitude, representing the wind drift and range angle. The sight head replaced the older wire crosshairs with a modern reflector sight that {{was easy to see}} at night. The sight could be rotated manually to view objects well in front of the aircraft, allowing the bomb aimer to select among a wider variety of objects to use for drift measurements.|$|E
50|$|Programmable <b>calculators</b> are <b>calculators</b> {{that can}} {{automatically}} {{carry out a}} sequence of operations under control of a stored program, much like a computer. The first programmable <b>calculators</b> such as the IBM CPC used punched cards or other media for program storage. Hand-held electronic <b>calculators</b> store programs on magnetic strips, removable read-only memory cartridges, or in battery-backed read/write memory.|$|R
40|$|<b>Calculators</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} required tools at home, school and work, however, people with disabilities may have difficulty using standard <b>calculators.</b> Buttons on most <b>calculators</b> are smooth, and offer few or no tactile clues to allow a person with a visual impairment to orient him or herself to the keypad. People with visual impairments may not be able to see the appropriate buttons. Modern <b>calculators</b> generally have an LCD output screen, but these are often difficult to see as character size is generally small, and the contrast between the numerals and background is low. People with mobility impairments or tremor are often unable to touch individual buttons accurately on compact <b>calculators</b> with small buttons. <b>Calculators</b> may perform basic calculations or be suitable for statistical, scientific, or financial calculations. Scientific <b>calculators</b> compute logarithms, sine, cosine, tangent, pi, square root, and exponents. Algebraic <b>calculators</b> and graphing <b>calculators</b> can simplify algebraic expressions; differentiate, integrate, and plot functions; solve equations; and manipulate matrices. Statistical <b>calculators</b> compute statistical equations, including means, variances, covariance, and correlation and regression coefficients. Financial <b>calculators</b> compute present value and internal-rate-of-return, depreciation, and schedules such as amortization and future value. Use requirements vary from simple direct keystroke calculation to complex multi-keystroke combinations. <b>Calculators</b> are available with features that range from simple to complex, and which are offered in a variety of combinations. Features include adjustable angle display, large numbers, large buttons, printing capability in black or color and speech output in a range of voices. The products described in this article are only a few of the many <b>calculators</b> available on the market today. The companies listed may also make or distribute other <b>calculators</b> that could not be included due to space limitations. Contact individual companies for more information...|$|R
50|$|Most notable {{is a line}} of <b>calculators,</b> {{which started}} {{production}} in 1968. The Electronika <b>calculators</b> were produced {{in a variety of}} sizes and function sets, ranging from large, bulky four-function <b>calculators</b> to smaller models designed for use in schools operating on a special, safer 42V standard (like the MK-SCH-2). As time progressed, Electronika <b>calculators</b> were produced that supported more advanced calculations, {{with some of the most}} recent models even offering full programmability and functionality similar to today's American-designed graphing <b>calculators.</b>|$|R
5|$|As well as addition, subtraction, {{multiplication}} and division, it had reciprocal and square-root functions, and {{the ability}} to multiply by a fixed constant. With an eight-digit display, the <b>calculator</b> could display positive numbers between 0.0000001 and 99,999,999, and negative numbers between -0.000001 and -9,999,999. Calculators of the time tended to have displays of between 3 and 12 digits, as reducing the number of digits was an effective way of reducing the cost of the <b>calculator.</b> A number outside that range leads to an overflow, and the screen flashes and all keys except the clear key are rendered inoperable to inform the user of the error. A independent memory register could read information from the screen, and information could only be taken from the memory onto the screen. Five keys were used for memory operations.|$|E
5|$|However, {{included}} with the <b>calculator</b> was a library of over 120 programs that performed common operations in mathematics, geometry, statistics, finance, physics, electronics, engineering, as well as fluid mechanics and materials science. The full library of standard programs contained over 400 programs in the Sinclair Program Library.|$|E
5|$|Satoru Iwata {{was born}} on December6, 1959, and raised in Sapporo, Japan, where his father served as a prefectural official. Throughout middle and high school, Iwata {{displayed}} leadership skills through service as class president, student council president, and club president at various times. His first experience with computers was in middle school with a demo computer that used telephone lines. Iwata would frequent the Sapporo subway and play a simple numeric game, called Game 31, until he mastered it. With money saved up from a dish-washing job and some additional allowance from his father, Iwata purchased an HP-65, the first programmable <b>calculator,</b> in 1974. After entering Hokkaido Sapporo South High School in April1975, he began developing his own games during his junior year. The several simple number games Iwata produced, such as Volleyball and Missile Attack, made use of an electronic <b>calculator</b> he shared with his schoolmates.|$|E

40|$|Developers of {{mathematics}} curricula make choices regarding {{the kinds of}} technology {{that are to be}} used by students, which in turn influences the work of both students and teachers to learn and teach mathematics. This paper analyses the potential relationships between <b>calculators</b> and the mathematics curriculum, drawing implications for what can be learned through student access to different levels of <b>calculators.</b> Three different levels of <b>calculators</b> are considered in detail in the paper: scientific <b>calculators,</b> advanced scientific <b>calculators</b> and graphics <b>calculators.</b> Significant consequences of these choices are described and exemplified through a consideration of a number of mathematical topics that are commonly taught in many curricula in Asian countries...|$|R
5|$|The monthly sales reached $100,000 in March 1973 and MITS {{moved to}} larger {{building}} with 10,000 square feet (930 square meters) of space.
