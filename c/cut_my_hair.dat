500|$|Rihanna {{explained}} {{that she wanted to}} keep the audience dancing and be soulful at the same time. She sought to make an album that people would listen to without skipping tracks. She cited Afrodisiac (2004), the fourth studio album by American singer Brandy Norwood, as her main inspiration for the album. In May 2007, Rihanna revealed that she called the album Good Girl Gone Bad because it represents her bolder and more independent image: [...] "I'm not the innocent Rihanna anymore. I'm taking a lot more risks and chances. I felt when I <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> it shows people I'm not trying to look or be anybody else. The album is very edgy." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hair" [...] was {{recorded}} mostly while Gaga was on tour in Europe, but the mixing {{was done by}} Gene Grimaldi at Oasis Mastering in [...] Burbank, California. It is a Hi-NRG song and begins with Gaga singing the line [...] "Whenever I dress cool, my parents put up a fight/ And if I'm a hot shot, Mom will <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> at night/ And in the morning I'm short of my identity/ I scream, 'Mom and Dad, why can't I be who I want to be?" [...] As the music grows louder, Gaga sings the sing along chorus of the song, gradually moving towards the breakdown—which is inspired by retro music—talking about the different hairstyles she has had. Jocelyn Vena from MTV described the track as a [...] "fist-pumping, defiant disco track all about having a good time." [...] Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone called it a mixture of yearning romantic melodrama of [...] "We Belong" [...] with the hard industrial metal edge of Broken-era Nine Inch Nails. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune felt that Gaga's vocals are Auto-Tuned throughout the song. The lyrics of [...] "Hair" [...] talk about embracing one's hairstyle as the ultimate expression of their identity, hence it ends with Gaga triumphantly declaring [...] "I am my hair!" [...] {{at the end of}} the final chorus.|$|E

2500|$|Muhammad Ali and James Brown {{acknowledged}} {{that their own}} approach to flamboyant self-promotion was influenced by George. A 19-year-old Ali met a 46-year-old George at a Las Vegas radio station. During George's radio interview, the wrestler's promo {{caught the attention of}} the future heavyweight champion. If George lost to Classy Freddie Blassie, George exclaimed, [...] "I'll crawl across the ring and <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> off! But that's not gonna happen because I'm the greatest wrestler in the world!" [...] Ali, who later echoed that very promo when taunting opponent Sonny Liston, recalled, [...] "I saw 15,000 people comin' to see this man get beat. And his talking did it. I said, 'This is a gooood idea!'" [...] In the locker room afterward, the seasoned wrestler gave the future legend some invaluable advice: [...] "A lot of people will pay to see someone shut your mouth. So keep on bragging, keep on sassing and always be outrageous." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1620, Tarabotti {{took her}} first vows and, in 1623, {{she took her}} final vows {{rendering}} her monastic status permanent. At least during her earlier years in the cloister, Tarabotti {{was said to have}} been rebellious and outspoken; Tarabotti refused to wear the religious habits or cut her hair until directly ordered to do so by Catholic Cardinal and Patriarch of Venice, Federico Baldissera Bartolomeo Cornaro. Her beliefs, however, remained unchanged; Tarabotti wrote of Cardinal Cornaro, explaining that “He made me amend <b>my</b> vanities. I <b>cut</b> off <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> but I did not uproot my emotions. I reformed my life, but my thoughts flourish rampantly, and just like <b>my</b> shorn <b>hair,</b> grow all the more.” [...] Indeed, though Tarabotti remained less outwardly rebellious after this time, she wrote that, by living as a nun, she was “living a lie.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now I have a {{very strange}} {{experience}} to tell you. I had, as you know, <b>cut</b> off <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> in London, and I had placed it in a great coil {{at the bottom of}} my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was <b>my</b> coil of <b>hair.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{never liked}} me," [...] the girl said, simply. [...] "She and father never got on well together, and I think her dislike began by his taking to me, and my liking {{to be with}} him and getting to talk English. There was a terrible quarrel between them once because she accused him of {{teaching}} me to be a Protestant, although he never did so. He did give me a Bible, and I used to ask him questions and he answered them, that was all; but as it did seem to me that he was much wiser in all things than she was, I thought that he might be wiser in religion too. I would have given up the property directly they wanted me to, if they would have let me go away to England; but when they took me to the convent and <b>cut</b> off <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> and forced me to become a nun, I would not give way to them. I never took the vows, Terence; I would not open my lips, but they went on with the service just the same. I was determined that I would not yield. I thought that the English would come some day, and that I might be freed then." ...|$|R

"I left it behind, in pieces, on the thorns {{and rocks}} along {{a good many}} leagues of trail; but it wasn't extensive--when you travel in this country you have often to choose between food and clothes.

60|$|Also we felt, {{all three}} of us, that we were {{extremely}} shabby-looking objects, and though none of us said so, each {{did his best to}} improve his personal appearance. First of all Bickley <b>cut</b> Bastin's and <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> after which I did him the same service. Then Bickley who was normally clean shaven, set to work to remove a beard of about a week's growth, and I who wore one of the pointed variety, trimmed up mine as best I could {{with the help of a}} hand-glass. Bastin, too, performed on his which was of the square and rather ragged type, wisely rejecting Bickley's advice to shave it off altogether, offered, I felt convinced, because he felt that the result on Bastin would be too hideous for words. After this we cut our nails, cleaned our teeth and bathed; I even caught Bickley applying hair tonic from his dressing case in secret, behind a projecting rock, and borrowed some myself. He gave it me on condition that I did not mention its existence to Bastin who, he remarked, would certainly use the lot and make himself smell horrible.|$|R

The British cyclist Len Levesley said he was astonished to find Coppi giving him a haircut.Levesley, who was on a stretcher with polio, said:"I should think it took me all of a full second to realise who it was. He looked fine, he looked slim, and having been in the desert, he looked tanned. I'd only seen him in cycling magazines but I knew instantly who he was. So he <b>cut</b> away at <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> and I tried to have a conversation with him, but he didn't speak English and I don't speak Italian.
