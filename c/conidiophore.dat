5000|$|The diverse conidia and <b>conidiophores</b> {{sometimes}} {{develop in}} asexual sporocarps with different characteristics (e.g. aecervulus, pycnidium, sporodochium).

5000|$|Acrophialophora fusispora {{is similar}} to Paecilomyces, but differ in the {{presence}} of pigmented, warted <b>conidiophores,</b> verticillate phialides in limited numbers with narrowing tip, and frequent sympodial proliferation. A. fusispora is distinguished by its pigmented [...] conidia, which are covered by spiral bands, measuring 5-12 x 3-6μm. The conidia arises in long single-cell basipetal chains, ranging from colorless to pale-brown and broadly ellipsoidal to lemon-shaped. The <b>conidiophores</b> arise singly, terminally, and laterally from the hyphae, and are erect or ascending, straight or flexuous, smooth or rough, and septate. Moreover, the <b>conidiophores</b> are thick-walled with brown at the base and pale towards the apex. The <b>conidiophores</b> are up to 1.5μm long and 2-5μm wide, with whorls of phialides at the end. The phialides are flask-shaped and swollen near the base, with a long, narrow neck, and hyaline, smooth or spiny wall. The phialides are borne on <b>conidiophores,</b> or sometimes, on vegetative hyphae, with the broadest part measuring 9-15μm x 3-4.5μm.|$|R

50|$|Asexual {{reproduction}} in ascomycetes (the phylum Ascomycota) is by {{the formation}} of conidia, which are borne on specialized stalks called <b>conidiophores.</b> The morphology of these specialized <b>conidiophores</b> is often distinctive of a specific species and can therefore be used in identification of the species.|$|R
50|$|The holotype of Mycetophagites {{consists}} of mycelium in a lone, partly decomposed fruiting body without any associated structures. The fungi are preserved in a rectangular piece of yellow amber approximately 3.25 cm by 1.25 cm by 1.0 cm.

The hyphae sport septate dark <b>conidiophores</b> that are simple or sparsely branched. Each of the <b>conidiophores</b> are born singly or as sparse clusters and are upright or almost upright.

50|$|Conidiophores of T. roseum {{are usually}} erect and are 200-300μm in length. They arise singly or in loose groups. Conidiophores are simple hyphae, which are septate in their lower half, and bear {{clusters}} of conidia at the tip. These conidiophores are indistinguishable from vegetative hyphae until {{production of the}} first conidium. Conidium development is distinctive and was first described by Ingold in 1956. Conidia arise as blowouts {{from the side of}} the <b>conidiophore</b> apex which is thus incorporated into the base of each spore. After the first conidium is blown out, before it matures, the apex of the <b>conidiophore</b> directly below blows out a second conidium from the opposite side. Conidia are pinched out from the <b>conidiophore</b> one after another in alternating directions in order to form the characteristic zigzag patterned chain. Conidia of T.roseum (15-20 × 7.5-10 μm) are smooth and clavate. Each conidium is two celled with the apical cell being larger than the curved basal cell. Conidia are light pink and appear translucent under the microscope. They appear a more saturated pink colour when grown in masses in culture or on the host surface.|$|E
50|$|Under the microscope, {{the mold}} phase {{will look like}} a typical Penicillium, with hyaline, septate and {{branched}} hyphae; the conidiophores are located both laterally and terminally.

5000|$|The phialide ( [...] phialis, {{diminutive}} of phiale, a broad, flat vessel) is a flask-shaped projection {{from the}} vesicle (dilated {{part of the}} top of <b>conidiophore)</b> of certain fungi.

50|$|P. teres (teleomorph Drechslera teres) {{makes up}} to 3 conidia per <b>conidiophore.</b> It infects plants with an appressorium.

50|$|Most {{species of}} the Entomophthorales produce {{ballistic}} asexual spores that are forcibly discharged. When not landing on a suitable host, these spores can germinate to make one of several alternate spore forms, including a smaller version of the original spore, or (in some species) an adhesive spore elevated on a very slender <b>conidiophore</b> called a capilliconidiophore.|$|E
50|$|Botrytis cinerea is {{characterized}} by abundant hyaline conida (asexual spores) borne on grey, branching tree-like <b>conidiophores.</b> The fungus also produces highly resistant sclerotia as survival structures in older cultures. It overwinters as sclerotia or intact mycelia, both of which germinate in spring to produce <b>conidiophores.</b> The conidia, dispersed by wind and by rain-water, cause new infections.|$|R
50|$|Conidia (singular: conidium) are spores {{produced}} {{at the tip}} of special branches called <b>conidiophores.</b>|$|R
50|$|Belonging to the Stenella genus, {{this species}} is a Cercospora-like fungus with a {{superficial}} secondary mycelium, solitary <b>conidiophores,</b> conidiogenous cells with thickened and darkened conidiogenous loci and catenate or single conidia with dark, slightly thickened hila. This species is characterised {{by the absence}} of stromata, its long <b>conidiophores</b> developing from the external mycelium and conidia mostly with 1 to 2 septa.|$|R
50|$|Conidiophores {{are highly}} {{branched}} and thus {{difficult to define}} or measure, loosely or compactly tufted, often formed in distinct concentric rings or borne along the scant aerial hyphae. Main branches of the conidiophores produce lateral side branches that may be paired or not, the longest branches distant from the tip and often phialides arising directly from the main axis near the tip. The branches may rebranch, with the secondary branches often paired and longest secondary branches being closest to the main axis. All primary and secondary branches arise at or near 90° {{with respect to the}} main axis. The typical Trichoderma <b>conidiophore,</b> with paired branches assumes a pyramidal aspect. Typically the <b>conidiophore</b> terminates in one or a few phialides. In some species (e.g. T. polysporum) the main branches are terminated by long, simple or branched, hooked, straight or sinuous, septate, thin-walled, sterile or terminally fertile elongations. The main axis may be the same width as the base of the phialide or it may be much wider.|$|E
50|$|When {{grown in}} pure culture {{conditions}} on {{a petri dish}} at a temperature of 25 C, Rhopalomyces elegans produces hyaline (translucent), partially submerged colonies that fill the plate in about six days. The fungus produces large, dark brown conidiospores borne on a swollen vesicle {{at the end of}} a <b>conidiophore.</b> The vesicles measure 40-63 μm in diameter. The hyphae are very thin, measuring only 2 μm in diameter.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mycelium}} of B.sorokiniana {{is usually}} deep olive-brown. New cultures produce abundant simple conidiophores, {{which may be}} single or clustered and measure 6-10 x 110-220 μm with septations. Conidia develop laterally from pores beneath each <b>conidiophore</b> setpum. Conidia are olive-brown and ovate to oblong, with rounded ends and a prominent basal scar. They measure 15-28 x 40-120 μm and are 3- to 10- septate. Some may be slightly curved. Their walls are smooth and noticeably thickened at the septa.|$|E

Mature aerial hyphae and spores showed no immunofluorescence at all. Sporulating <b>conidiophores</b> revealed only weak activity in A. fumigatus and A. flavus.

5000|$|The genus {{was first}} {{described}} in the scientific literature by Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link in his 1809 work Observationes in ordines plantarum naturales, writing [...] "Penicillium.

50|$|Colonies of Exserohilum {{range from}} the color grey to blackish-brown. The texture varies from suede-like to floccose in texture. The species also have an olivaceous to black reverse.

50|$|In vitro {{studies of}} E. rostratum growth show {{sporulation}} {{to be completely}} inhibited by light at 34 C but not at lower temperatures.
