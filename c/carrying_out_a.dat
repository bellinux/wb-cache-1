5|$|In 1947, Đujić {{was tried}} and sentenced in {{absentia}} {{for war crimes}} by Yugoslavia.

5|$|Spoilt Rotten {{received}} a mostly favourable reception in the media. Dalrymple was praised for <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> thought-provoking and convincing {{analysis of a}} newly emerged cultural phenomenon which sees emotion substituted for reason.

5|$|The key {{geographical}} {{features that}} had influenced the landings also influenced {{the next phase}} of the battle: the draws, the natural exits off the beaches, were the main targets in the initial assault plan. The strongly concentrated defenses around these draws meant that the troops landing near them quickly became incapable of <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> further assault. In the areas between the draws, at the bluffs, units were able to land in greater strength. Defenses were also weaker away from the draws, thus most advances were made there.|$|E

5|$|Atlantis finally docked to Mir's Kristall module {{using the}} docking module's top {{androgynous}} unit on flight day 4. The tension was high aboard Atlantis as Cameron maneuvered the shuttle towards Mir using the orbiter's thrusters. Atlantis docked with Mir at 06:27:38UTC following a faultless set of orbital maneuvers. After all the required checks {{had been completed}} and the hatches had been opened, the five shuttle astronauts moved into Mir, ready to carry out three days of combined operations with Mirs resident crew, Russian cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Avdeyev (carrying out the Mir EO-20 expedition) and ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter (flying on the Euromir 95 expedition).

5|$|Baker {{proceeded}} {{overseas to}} France on 15 June 1918 and, on arrival the following day, was posted to No.4 Squadron AFC piloting Sopwith Camels. On 23 June, he flew his first operational sortie over the German lines; {{he was promoted}} to lieutenant four days later. On 31 July, Baker was among a formation of seven Camels tasked with <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> patrol over German-held territory. The group crossed over into German lines near Nieppe Forrest, and flew towards Estaires. The Camels soon intercepted a formation of seven Fokker D.VIIs, and the entire patrol immediately dived at the German aircraft. In the ensuing melee, Baker managed to force one of the aircraft down to the ground, thus scoring his first aerial victory.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, {{the castle}} was {{suffering}} badly {{from the effects}} of coastal erosion but remained in military use until 1863. The War Office then demolished the upper levels with explosives, <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> second wave of demolition work in 1882 and destroying most of the surviving stonework in 1893. The remains of Sandown were purchased by the town of Deal for £35 to form part of the local sea defences. The remaining masonry was encased in concrete in the late 1980s to form a sea wall but remains vulnerable to further erosion by the sea.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} two weeks, the outnumbered Berryforce {{attempted}} to retake the strategically important town in the Battle of Merdjayoun. His first attempt was a failure. After <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> personal reconnaissance on 18 June, Berryman tried again. This time his attack was halted by staunch defence by the French Foreign Legion and tanks. Berryman then tried a different approach. Instead of attempting to capture the town, he seized high ground overlooking the French supply lines. Faced with being cut off, the French withdrew from the town. Berryforce was then dissolved and Berryman returned to his role as commander of the 7th Division artillery.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the {{two couples}} {{discovered}} that Red House {{was up for}} sale, and as architects {{with an interest in}} Morris, they recognised its historic value. By this point, the Red House had been empty for 18 months, after Thomas Hills and his family had left in 1951, and had fallen into a state of dilapidation. Deciding to share the property between themselves, they were able to afford a mortgage {{with the aid of a}} loan from Toms' father-in-law; he only agreed to provide the loan if the house was owned in Toms' name, and thus the Hollambys became Toms' tenants. The two families then moved in with their six children, and a seventh was born soon after. They camped in the house's grounds while <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> project of renovation.|$|E

5|$|In a 2011 {{article for}} the International Journal of Otolaryngology, Jeremy Hornibrook {{discussed}} the inner ear disorder Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV {{is the most common}} cause of vertigo, a problem attributed to a detached otoconia in one of the semicircular canals. Hornibrook recommended a repositioning treatment for patients with BPPV from the posterior canal location. He wrote that the procedure most often performed for this purpose was a slightly transformed version of the Epley maneuver, and afterwards recommended <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> Dix–Hallpike test to assess the status of BPPV. If such a test was positive, Hornibrook recommended using a Magic Wand to deliver vibrations to the area of the mastoid process.|$|E
5|$|On 12 January 2009, {{at least}} three people, {{including}} two Mexicans and one American, entered the Parque-Museo La Venta in Villahermosa and damaged just under 30 archaeological pieces, including the four La Venta colossal heads. The vandals were all members of an evangelical church and {{appeared to have been}} <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> supposed pre-Columbian ritual, during which salts, grape juice, and oil were thrown on the heads. It was estimated that 300,000 pesos (US$21,900) would be needed to repair the damage, and the restoration process would last four months. The three vandals were released soon after their arrest after paying 330,000 pesos each.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Soviet war in Afghanistan, Su-25s {{launched}} a total of 139 guided missiles of all types against Mujahideen positions.

The Office of Works took control of the castle in 1913, <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> programme of repairs, and it was used by the military in both the First and Second World Wars.

Of the eighteen people on board, five survived. Koch was wounded by gunfire in the left leg and left arm, and broke his right leg in the subsequent crash landing. Despite the injuries, he swam about five miles to the shore where he was looked after by local people, until the Dutch Navy found the survivors some days later, and rescued them with a Dornier flying boat. Some three weeks later, he was in Darwin hospital {{on the day of}} the first Japanese raid on Darwin.
