He looks up and sees the house's occupants with slit throats in pools of blood. Abruptly, two police officers burst into the house and apprehend Fassl. One of the officers who goes to check out the kitchen turns to reveal he is John Doggett (Robert Patrick) as a young NYPD officer.|$|E
5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} {{to get under way}} when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar was forced to cut her <b>cable.</b> <b>As</b> she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, mainsail, main topmast staysail, and mizzen staysail tore. Having already lost her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was out of danger and able to ride out the storm, and the next day at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E

25|$|The fiber {{is used in}} woven {{rope and}} in cable, where the fibers are kept {{parallel}} within a polyethylene sleeve. The cables {{have been used in}} suspension bridges such as the bridge at Aberfeldy in Scotland. They have also been used to stabilize cracking concrete cooling towers by circumferential application followed by tensioning to close the cracks. Kevlar is widely used as a protective outer sheath for optical fiber <b>cable,</b> <b>as</b> its strength protects the cable from damage and kinking. When used in this application it is commonly known by the trademarked name Parafil.|$|E

25|$|The {{clock in}} the {{building}} tower was originally mechanical in nature, and kept accurate time via gravity. A cable was wrapped around a drum, and a large weight attached {{to the end of}} the <b>cable.</b> <b>As</b> the cable unwound due to the force of gravity, the clock hands turned. The cable was rewound once or twice a day. On October 10, 1956, the weight came loose from the cable and plunged through two floors (narrowly avoiding killing a man, who had just gotten up from his desk). The mechanical clock was later replaced with an electric one.|$|E
25|$|Drum brakes provide {{consistent}} braking in wet or dirty conditions {{since the}} mechanism is fully enclosed. They are usually heavier, more complicated, and often weaker than rim brakes, but they require less maintenance. Drum brakes do not adapt well to quick release axle fastening, and removing a drum brake wheel requires the operator to disconnect the brake <b>cable</b> <b>as</b> {{well as the}} axle. They also require a torque arm which must be anchored to the frame or fork of the bicycle, and not all bicycles are constructed to accommodate such fastenings or tolerate their applied forces.|$|E
25|$|Cable needles are a {{specific}} design, {{and are used}} to create the twisting motif of a knitted cable. They are made in different sizes, which produces cables of different widths. When in use, the cable needle is used {{at the same time}} as two regular needles. It functions by holding together the stitches creating the <b>cable</b> <b>as</b> the other needles create the rest of the stitches for the knitted piece. At specific points indicated by the knitting pattern, the cable needle is moved, the stitches on it are worked by the other needles, then the cable needle is turned around to a different position to create the cable twist.|$|E

25|$|The {{next major}} {{stepping}} stone for ESPN {{came over the}} course of a couple of months in 1984. During this time period, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) purchased 100% of ESPN from the Rasmussens and Getty Oil. Under Getty ownership, the channel was unable to compete for the television rights to major sports events contracts as its majority corporate parent would not provide the funding, leading ESPN to lose out for broadcast deals with the National Hockey League (to USA Network) and NCAA Division I college football (to TBS). For years, the NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball refused to consider <b>cable</b> <b>as</b> a means of broadcasting some of their games. However, with the backing of ABC, ESPN's ability to compete for major sports contracts greatly increased, and gave it credibility within the sports broadcasting industry.|$|E
25|$|The bell is {{deployed}} {{over the}} side of the vessel or platform using a gantry or A-frame or through a moon pool. Deployment usually starts by lowering the clump weight, which is a large ballast weight suspended from a cable which runs down one side from the gantry, through a set of sheaves on the weight, and up the other side back to the gantry, where it is fastened. The weight hangs freely between the two parts of the cable, and due to its weight, hangs horizontally and keeps the cable under tension. The bell hangs between the parts of the cable, and has a fairlead on each side which slides along the <b>cable</b> <b>as</b> it is lowered or lifted. The bell hangs from a cable attached to the top. As the bell is lowered, the fairleads guide it down the clump weight cables to the workplace.|$|E
