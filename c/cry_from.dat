5|$|McCabe totalled 385 runs at 42.78 for {{the series}} and was the only Australian batsman other than Bradman to score a century, as the English decisively won the series 41. He took three wickets at 71.66, and opened the bowling {{in some of the}} matches due to Australia's lack of fast bowling. It was a far <b>cry</b> <b>from</b> the {{intimidation}} that Bodyline provided.|$|E
5|$|The match started amid clear weather, a far <b>cry</b> <b>from</b> the {{previous}} Ashes Test {{at the ground}} in 1938, which was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to continuous rain for several days. The outfield was also smooth and green, a contrast to its state during World War II, when it was left cratered by German bombing raids. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.|$|E
5|$|Affected by her {{association}} with Cheng Shuyao, Shangguan {{did not play}} any major role for several years. This changed in 1955, when she starred in the film Storm on the Southern Island. Director Bai Chen (白沉) chose her to play the leading role as a heroic nurse, a far <b>cry</b> <b>from</b> her traditional roles of socialites and rich wives. She adjusted to her new role well, and portrayed {{a wide variety of}} characters in many films including It's My Day Off (1959), Spring Comes to the Withered Tree (1961, director Zheng Junli), Early Spring in February (1963, director Xie Tieli), and Stage Sisters (1965, director Xie Jin). She was {{recognized as one of the}} most talented and versatile actresses in China.|$|E
40|$|Can adults {{attribute}} {{different meanings}} to the cries {{produced by the}} newborns {{on the basis of}} physical-acoustic cues in different communication conditions? In order to test this hypothesis, 20 females were asked to evaluate (according to four scales: anguish, anger, annoyance, care-seeking) 24 <b>cries</b> <b>from</b> 12 healthy full-term newborns (4 - 7 h old) : 6 newborns previously exposed to tactile communication (Group 1); 6 newborns without communication (Group 2). Annoyance category was not reliable and it was excluded from analyses. The 20 females attributed a higher rate of anger and anguish to the <b>cries</b> <b>from</b> Group 2, and a higher rate of care-seeking to the <b>cries</b> <b>from</b> Group 1. They attributed different meanings to the <b>cries</b> <b>from</b> Group 1, and undifferentiated meanings to the <b>cries</b> <b>from</b> Group 2. Consistent with bivariate analyses, Dysphonic Cry was the strongest predictor of anger/anguish. Although the Hyperphonic Cry was quantitatively not relevant, its absence was the first predictor for care-seeking...|$|R

5|$|An art {{exhibition}} of Little Busters! {{was held in}} Osaka, Japan between May 3 and May 4, 2007, and in Tokyo, Japan between May 24 and May 25, 2007. A large amount of the character and background art featured in the game was showcased, along with original art used to promote the character artwork, and other production sketches drawn when the game was still in development. Flowcharts outlining the story for the game were on display, along with the flowcharts for Clannad. Also at the exhibition was a life-size mannequin of Rin Natsume with a baseball glove in one hand, though instead of a baseball, a cat was in the glove. This mannequin was later put onto the Japanese Yahoo! Auction website in late September 2007 and sold for 764,000 yen, a far <b>cry</b> <b>from</b> the original wish of selling the figure for 5,000,000 yen.|$|E
5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq to hunt for Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It was a far <b>cry</b> <b>from</b> the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But {{it would not be a}} replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces.|$|E
5|$|His 1964–65 tour of {{the subcontinent}} {{on the way back}} to Australia was even worse, a far <b>cry</b> <b>from</b> his leading role in the {{previous}} tour to the subcontinent. After making 40 and 0 in the First Test win in Madras, he was unable to bat either innings in the Second Test in Bombay after being hospitalised due to persistent vomiting, injury as Australia ceded their series lead. He missed the remainder of the series, the Third Test in Calcutta and a one-off Test in Pakistan. Upon his return home, he has a shortened domestic season before Australia left for the West Indies. In five domestic matches, he scored 357 runs at 59.50, including a 133 not against South Australia.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1960–61 NBA season, Robertson {{made himself}} {{eligible}} for the 1960 NBA draft. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals as a territorial pick. The Royals gave Robertson a $33,000 signing bonus, a far <b>cry</b> <b>from</b> his childhood days when he was too poor to afford a basketball. In his rookie season, Robertson averaged 30.5 points, 10.1 rebounds and 9.7 assists (leading the league), almost averaging a triple-double for the entire season. He was named NBA Rookie of the Year, was elected into the All-NBA First Team – which would happen in each of Robertson's first nine seasons – and made the first of 12 consecutive All-Star Game appearances. In addition, he was named the 1961 NBA All-Star Game MVP following his 23-point, 14-assist, 9-rebound performance in a West victory. However, the Royals finished with a 33–46 record and stayed in the cellar of the Western Division.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{continued}} to prosper through the 1920s and 1930s with a toll of one quarter {{to cross the}} bridge, with drivers of State Highway Route 6 coming along the bridge from the junction with State Highway Route 8 coming across the bridge since 1927. During the 1920s and 1930s, the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to buy out bridges along the Delaware River under the Joint Commission for the Elimination of Toll Bridges. The reconstructed bridge at Belvidere was bought by the commission for $60,000 (1920s USD) and the covered bridge at Columbia for only $50,000. Although the commission tried to buy the second-hand railroad bridge for a lower, unspecified amount, Darlington used his strong bargaining skills to raise the amount to $275,000, a far <b>cry</b> <b>from</b> the other local bridges. Residents of Knowlton Township, New Jersey rejoiced at the fact of when the bridge was bought, tolls were eliminated from the crossing. The new generation of people prospered {{at the thought that}} the crossing the Delaware would be forever free.|$|E
5|$|The site {{only allowed}} for the {{building}} to be one room deep, as a workhouse and a barracks lay immediately behind. To exacerbate matters, there was a public right of way through the site to these buildings, which accounts for the access porticoes on the eastern and western sides of the façade. These had to incorporate columns from the demolished Carlton House and their relative shortness result in an elevation that was deemed excessively low, and a far <b>cry</b> <b>from</b> the commanding focal point that was desired for {{the northern end of}} the Square. Also recycled are the sculptures on the façade, originally intended for Nash's Marble Arch but abandoned due to his financial problems. The eastern half of the building housed the Royal Academy until 1868, which further diminished the space afforded to the Gallery.|$|E

5|$|Nefarious covers human {{trafficking}} in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Interviews are interspersed with re-enactments. The film {{opens with a}} re-enactment of a girl being kidnapped by organized criminals. She is confined with other girls in a dark room, lit by a flickering lightbulb. Men order the girls to remove their clothes, and then examine them and shout commands and threats at them, causing them to <b>cry</b> <b>from</b> fear. One girl is dragged into another room. A victim of ordeals such as these, speaking in voiceover, explains that, in this situation, girls are often taken into a separate room to have their sexual performance tested. Identifying these events as taking place near Belgrade, Serbia, the film then tracks the fictional girls through Croatia to Amsterdam's red-light district De Wallen, and to sex markets in Berlin and Las Vegas. The film states that this slavery goes unnoticed in cities where prostitution is legal. Slaves are depicted in confinement, at their places of work, and as they are sold. Many of the girls are orphans, and all are either kidnapped or tricked into forced prostitution. Traffickers in the film use hard drugs, brainwashing and sexual and physical abuse to keep the girls under control.|$|E
5|$|The Darlington's Bridge at Delaware Station was {{a highway}} {{bridge over the}} Delaware River in the {{community}} of Delaware, New Jersey (known locally as Delaware Station). Formerly a railroad bridge constructed by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1871 to replace an earlier 1855 timber span, the bridge was sold off when the new one upstream was constructed. Henry V. Darlington, an Episcopal minister in Delaware and nearby Belvidere offered to buy the second-hand bridge for $5,000 (1914 USD, equal to $ today). Darlington converted it into a highway bridge, using two fired members of the nearby Meyer's Ferry to be toll collectors. The bridge prospered, becoming a part of State Highway Route6 in 1927 and U.S. Route46 in 1936. In 1932, during the massive state takeover of bridges by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, Darlington refused offers, bargaining his way up to $275,000 (1932 USD, equal to $ today) before accepting the sale. This amount was a far <b>cry</b> <b>from</b> the nearby Belvidere-Riverton and Portland-Columbia Covered Bridge, which were accepted for $60,000 (equal to $ today) and $50,000 (equal to $ today) respectively. On that moment, tolls along the bridge and Route6 were eliminated. The bridge prospered toll-free for another 21 years, until the construction of the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge upstream at Columbia. Although Reverend Darlington was still alive to see all this transpire, the Commission ceased operations on the Darlington Bridge on April3, 1954, and the bridge was immediately demolished.|$|E

25|$|The {{school was}} named after St Crispin, {{the patron saint of}} cobblers, tanners and leather workers.
