We aimed to (i) Describe the number of approved centres per year in which we observed comments about the presence of security personnel in published reports <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> conducted from 2008 to 2012 (ii) Report the main themes of all text relating to security personnel published in these inspection reports. Method We conducted a <b>content</b> analysis <b>of</b> all 349 <b>inspection</b> reports published between 2008 and 2012. Results The number of approved centres in which security personnel were noted increased from 3 % to 8 % between the years 2008 and 2012. This increase was not statistically significant when the same unique centres were compared between years (p= 0. 684). Employment details such as contracted employment relationship, location relative to the approved centre and hours of work appeared inconsistent across centres. Role functions of security personnel differed across centres and ranged from monitoring the entrance of a unit to observing, restraining and secluding patients. Contrasting perceptions of suitability were evident in the inspection reports. The extent to which the training needs of security personnel were met was unclear from the reports.

This paper describes how dying and death in care homes for older people is regulated and inspected. A documentary analysis was undertaken of the standard that addresses dying and death in the 2001 Care Homes for Older People: National Minimum Standards. Present in the standard is a ‘good death’ template drawn from constructions of best practice in palliative care. The way in which this national standard is enacted in the inspection process is described using a <b>content</b> analysis <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> reports from 226 care homes for older people. These present a narrow focus on dying and death, one that emphasises the older person's wishes {{and the degree of}} adherence to policies and procedures concerned with the dying and death event. A regulated death attenuates the ‘good death’ template and reflects both the inspection process and capabilities of the residents of care homes. If the regulation and inspection process is to integrate dying with living, a broader conception and regime <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> is required. Only then will end-of-life care be provided that meets the diverse needs of older people who live in care homes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—High-speed <b>content</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> {{network traffic}} is an {{important}} new application area for programmable networking systems, and has recently led to several proposals for high-performance regular expression matching. At the same time, the number {{and complexity of the}} patterns present in well-known network intrusion detection systems has been rapidly increasing. This increase is important since both the practicality and the performance of specific pattern matching designs are strictly dependent upon characteristics of the underlying regular expression set. However, a commonly agreed upon workload for the evaluation <b>of</b> deep packet <b>inspection</b> architectures is still missing, leading to frequent unfair comparisons, and to designs lacking in generality or scalability. In this paper, we propose a workload for the evaluation of regular expression matching architectures. The workload includes a regular expression model and a traffic generator, with the former characterizing different levels of expressiveness within rule-sets and the latter characterizing varying degrees of malicious network activity. The proposed workload is used here to evaluate designs (e. g., different memory layouts and hardware organizations) where the matching algorithm is based on compressed deterministic and non deterministic finite automata (DFAs and NFAs).

40|$|Background Coercive {{psychiatric}} treatment {{is one of}} the most controversial practices in medicine with some arguing that it is unfortunately necessary and others arguing that it is unjustified torture. Further research is required to inform clinical decision-making and service development. Objectives In study one, I aim to determine predictors and associations of coercion during admission. In study two, I aim to determine the impact of coercion during admission on outcomes one year after discharge. In study three, I aim to illuminate patient perspectives on coercion. In study four, I aim to determine the number of psychiatric hospitals in which security personnel were noted in inspection reports and describe the main themes of those notes. Methods This thesis comprised of four studies which emerged from a mix of three methods: observational cohort design (study one and two), thematic analysis of qualitative interviews (study three) and <b>content</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> reports (study four). Results Lower functioning predicted more accumulated coercive events during admission. Higher levels of accumulated coercive events and male gender during admission predicted more inpatient days between discharge and one year follow up. Patients conceptualised pressure primarily as an affective state characterised by intense feelings of stress. Patients experienced this stress across a broad range of contexts throughout their mental health treatment including administration of medication and involuntary admission. The number of psychiatric hospitals in which security personnel were noted increased from 3 % - 8 % between the years 2008 – 2012. Inconsistent employment details, differing role functions, contrasting perceptions of suitability and unmet training needs in relation to security personnel was evident across inspection reports. Conclusions Coercion is unfortunately common in clinical mental health practice but it remains unclear if it leads to clinical or social improvements.

40|$|It {{is vital}} to develop systems of {{preventing}} risk-associated pathology due to constantly high levels of endocrine diseases in children exposed to chemicals with trophic effects on endocrine system (lead, cadmium, manganese, chromium, nickel, benzene, phenol, formaldehyde, benzpyrene, chlorine-organic compounds, and nitrates). Applying risk management techniques {{is one of the}} most promising trends in prevention of diseases related to environmental impacts. We offer methodical approaches based on system combination of activities at various management levels aimed at improving risk-oriented model of surveillance and control. These approaches enable allowing for detected thropic risk factors in regional social-hygienic monitoring programs, implementing algorithms of case monitoring over exposed children population, and applying contemporary prevention technologies. Social-hygienic monitoring improvement at territorial level implies stricter control and more comprehensive lists of monitored components. This can be achieved by studying compounds which form risks for endocrine system, by working out scientific-methodological grounds for accounting chemical compounds which are trophic for endocrine system, as well as by refining volumes and <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> scheduled <b>inspections</b> performed at high risks objects together with laboratory examination of chemical compounds including those thropic for endocrine system.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{offers a}} scalable, low-cost, and resilient platform for critical applications. Securing these applications against attacks targeting unknown vulnerabilities is an unsolved challenge. Network anomaly detection addresses such zero-day attacks by modeling attributes of attack-free application traffic and raising alerts when new traffic deviates from this model. Content anomaly detection (CAD) is {{a variant of}} this approach that models the payloads of such traffic instead of higher level attributes. Zero-day attacks then appear as outliers to properly trained CAD sensors. In the past, CAD was unsuited to cloud environments due to the relative overhead <b>of</b> <b>content</b> <b>inspection</b> and the dynamic routing <b>of</b> <b>content</b> paths to geographically diverse sites. We challenge this notion and introduce new methods for efficiently aggregating content models to enable scalable CAD in dynamically-pathed environments such as the cloud. These methods eliminate the need to exchange raw content, drastically reduce network and CPU overhead, and offer varying levels <b>of</b> <b>content</b> privacy. We perform a comparative analysis of our methods using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Bloom Filter-based classifiers for operation in the cloud or other distributed settings such as wireless sensor networks. We find that content model aggregation offers statistically significant improvements over non-aggregate models with minimal overhead, and that distributed and non-distributed CAD have statistically indistinguishable performance. Thus, these methods enable the practical deployment of accurate CAD sensors in a distributed attack detection infrastructure...|$|R
