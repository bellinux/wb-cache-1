It documents a shameful catalogue of cruelty: neglect, physical, sexual and emotional abuse, perpetrated against children." [...] He declared that anyone responsible for abusing children in Catholic-run institutions should be held to account.

After this incident Russian Children's Ombudsman Pavel Astakhov said: [...] "We must, as much as possible, keep our <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> country" [...] and urged for more restrictions on the international adoptions in Russia. The Chairwoman of the Russian parliamentary committee on family and children Yelena Mizulina meanwhile pointed out that 30,000 children were sent back to institutions by their Russian adoptive, foster or guardianship families {{in the last three}} years. “Specialists call such a boom in returns a humanitarian catastrophe,” she added.|$|E

One of the most interesting sessions was with Asaya Fujita and Sue Giles. Moderated by Sarah Zahid the discussion among panelists was remarkable. The session held at Alhamra Arts Council - Hall 1, highlighted the importance of theatre and arts for children. Director of Polyglot Theatre, Sue Giles said that through theatre, we achieve an opportunity to present space and time to subjective experience and nourish the child’s brain power. “The idea of ‘value for money’ is another issue how people perceive the place and power of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> midst. We neglect our children’s physical freedoms we once had,” Sue added. While the session ‘Society and Drama’ highlighted the issues of theatre industry in both countries Pakistan and Korea.

60|$|Productive {{work for}} {{children}} {{has the advantage}} that its discipline is the discipline of impersonal necessity, not that of wanton personal coercion. The eagerness of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> industrial districts to escape from school to the factory is not caused by lighter tasks or shorter hours in the factory, nor altogether by the temptation of wages, nor even by the desire for novelty, but by the dignity of adult work, the exchange of the factitious personal tyranny of the schoolmaster, from which the grown-ups are free, for the stern but entirely dignified Laws of Life to which all flesh is subject.|$|E

Therefore I must spend many hours in searching for straw, since I have no means wherewith to pay others to do this for me." ...|$|E

60|$|Physical want or {{hardship}} is not {{the great}} thing which a mother need dread for her <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> country. There is scarce any situation in America where a child would not receive, {{as a matter of}} course, good food and shelter; nor is he often overworked.

60|$|We {{went along}} paths that led from one {{vineyard}} to another, and {{which might have}} led us for miles across the country. The grapes had been partly gathered, but still there were many purple or white clusters hanging heavily on the vines. We passed cottage doors, and saw groups of contadini and contadine in their festal attire, and they saluted us graciously; but it was observable {{that one of the}} men generally lingered on our track to see that no grapes were stolen, for there were a good many young people and <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> train, not only our own, but some from a neighboring villa. These Italian peasants are a kindly race, but, I doubt, not very hospitable of grape or fig.|$|E
60|$|How {{do things}} stand? Each {{year in this}} country about 100,000 babies die before they have come into the world; {{and out of the}} 800,000 born, about 90,000 die. Many mothers become {{permanently}} damaged in health by evil birth conditions. Many children grow up mentally or physically defective. One in four of the <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> elementary schools are not in a condition to benefit properly by their schooling. What sublime waste! Ten in a hundred of them suffer from malnutrition; thirty in the hundred have defective eyes; eighty in the hundred need dental treatment; twenty odd in the hundred have enlarged tonsils or adenoids. Many, perhaps most, of these deaths and defects are due to the avoidable ignorance, ill-health, mitigable poverty, and other handicaps which dog poor mothers before and after a baby's birth. One doesn't know which to pity most--the mothers or the babies. Fortunately, to help the one is to help the other. In passing I would like to record two sentiments: my strong impression that we ought to follow the example of America and establish Mothers' Pensions; and my strong hope that those who visit the sins of the fathers upon illegitimate children will receive increasingly the contempt they deserve from every decent-minded citizen.|$|E
