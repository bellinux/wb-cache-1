25|$|On April 17, a Surratt {{neighbor}} told US {{military authorities}} that he overheard {{one of the}} Surratt's servants saying that three men had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{on the night of}} Lincoln's assassination and that one of the men had mentioned Booth in a theater. (The servant was mistaken about the date, as John Surratt, Jr. had indeed been in Elmira, New York, on a mission for a Confederate general). Other pieces of information also mentioned the boarding house as a key meeting place of the possible conspirators. Either Colonel Henry H. Wells, Provost Marshal (head of the military police) of the District of Columbia, or General Christopher C. Augur told Colonel Henry Steel Olcott to arrest everyone in the house. Federal soldiers visited the Surratt boarding house again late on the evening of April 17. John, Jr., could not be found, but after a search of the house, the agents found in Mary's room a picture of Booth, hidden behind another photograph, pictures of Confederate leaders including Jefferson Davis, a pistol, a mold for making bullets, and percussion caps. As Mary was being arrested for conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln, Powell appeared at her door in disguise. Although Surratt denied knowing him, Powell claimed that he was a laborer hired by Surratt to dig a ditch the next morning. The discrepancy and Powell's unusually well-groomed appearance, quite unlike a ditch-digger, prompted his arrest. He was later identified as the man who had attempted to assassinate Secretary of State William Seward.|$|E
2500|$|The father pays an {{employee}} of his factory, Christina, to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and have sex with the son. Frustrated by the son's refusal to give her cunnilingus, Christina trades her headband with the elder daughter in exchange for cunnilingus from her. The elder daughter convinces the younger daughter to lick her shoulder by bartering the headband. Later, the younger daughter volunteers to lick the elder again. The elder has nothing to offer in exchange, but the younger does not mind and experiments by licking other body parts.|$|E
2500|$|When Pintarić {{exited the}} house in the morning, he was called to surrender, but he opened fire instead. There was a brief {{exchange}} in which Pintarić was wounded and he ran back into the house. He still refused to surrender, and asked for his attorney. When the attorney came, Pintarić asked him to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> which the police did not allow. By noon of the same day, it was apparent that voluntary surrender is very unlikely, and the police fired tear gas into the compound. Pintarić then shot Buhiniček in the stomach, accusing her of [...] "ratting" [...] him, and fired on the police. One of the policemen then entered the house and killed Pintarić by a single gunshot to the head. The woman survived the shooting.|$|E
