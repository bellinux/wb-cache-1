Payments for these aircraft together with a downturn in transatlantic traffic, increased competition on the transatlantic route by additional carriers equipped with jet aircraft, and {{a whole host of}} additional <b>costs</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Vickers VC10 and Bristol Britannia purchase would result in BOAC becoming extremely unprofitable from late 1961 onwards.|$|E

In the end, the Max Moon character was given to Paul Diamond, who appeared as the character on the first episode of Monday Night Raw on January 11, 1993. After a brief run, the character was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{during the}} Ford and Carter administrations to force {{metrication}} were seized on by many newspaper editorialists as being dictatorial. Public response included resistance, apathy, and sometimes ridicule. The underlying {{reasons for this}} response include a relative uniformity of weights and measures (though, notably, US liquid measure differed by about 20% from British Imperial measure, which was adopted throughout the British Empire in 1824) inherited from the United Kingdom in 1776, a homogeneous economy {{and the influence of}} business groups and populists in Congress caused the country to look at the short-term <b>costs</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> change-over, particularly those that would be borne by the consumer rather than long-term benefits of efficiency and international trade.

5|$|The Western {{industrial}} {{revolution of the}} 18th to 19th centuries tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease.

5|$|In 1859 {{a further}} {{edition of the}} Statutes was issued; the changes related mainly to the <b>costs</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Order. Prior to this date {{it had been the}} policy that the {{insignia}} (which were provided by the Crown) were to be returned on the death of the holder; the exception had been foreigners who had been awarded honorary membership. In addition foreigners had usually been provided with stars made of silver and diamonds, whereas ordinary members had only embroidered stars. The decision was made to award silver stars to all members, and only require the return of the Collar. The Crown had also been paying the fees due to the officers of the Order for members who had been appointed for the services in the recent war. The fees were abolished and replaced with a salary of approximately the same average value. The offices of Genealogist and Messenger were abolished, and those of Registrar and Secretary combined.|$|E
5|$|The {{financing}} plan involved {{public and private}} funding. At the time, the city planned to pay $75million for the acquisition {{of the land and}} construction of the stadium project. However, a 2017 audit revealed that it had actually paid $91million after accounting for additional <b>costs</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> expedited schedule and infrastructure work around the project site. The stadium is owned by the city and is leased to the team for 30years, until 2045. The Sounds ownership group spent $50million on a new, mixed-use and retail development next to the facility. The construction of two apartment buildings with retail space beyond the left field wall is scheduled to be completed in early 2018. North of the site, Embrey Development Corp. built a privately funded apartment complex called The Carillon. The city's original $75million planned expenditure resulted in taking on $4.3million in annual debt, paid for by five city revenue streams: an annual $700,000 Sounds' lease payment, $650,000 in stadium-generated sales tax revenue, $750,000 in property taxes from the Sounds development, $675,000 in property taxes from the Embrey development, and $520,000 in tax increment financing. The additional overage was paid with existing Metro capital funds. The city pays $345,000 for annual maintenance of the stadium.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} began purchasing church run boarding {{schools in the}} 1920s. During this period capital <b>costs</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> schools were assumed by the government, leaving administrative and instructional duties to church officials. The hope was that minimizing facility expenditures would allow church administrators to provide higher quality instruction and support to the students in their care. Although the government was willing to, and did, purchase schools from the churches, many were acquired for free given that the rampant disrepair present in the buildings resulted in their having no economic value. Schools continued to be maintained by churches in instances where they failed {{to reach an agreement}} with government officials with the understanding that the government would provide support for capital costs. The understanding ultimately proved complicated {{due to the lack of}} written agreements outlining the extent and nature of that support or the approvals required to undertake expensive renovations and repairs.|$|E
