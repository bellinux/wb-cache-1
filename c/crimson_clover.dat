40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Oregon is the world’s leading {{producer}} of <b>crimson</b> <b>clover</b> (Trifolium incarnatum L.) seed. Recent research {{has reported that}} seed yield has been increased in cool-season grass and red clover (T. pratense L.) seed crops with the application of trinexapac-ethyl, a gibberellic acid biosynthesis inhibiting plant growth regulator (PGR) and lodging-control agent. There is very little readily accessible information on the management of <b>crimson</b> <b>clover</b> seed crops, and no {{work has been done}} that determines the effect of trinexapac-ethyl on seed production in <b>crimson</b> <b>clover.</b> The objectives of this study were: (i) to create a resource document for production of <b>crimson</b> <b>clover</b> seed crops, (ii) to determine the effect of trinexapac-ethyl on seed yield and seed yield components in <b>crimson</b> <b>clover,</b> and (iii) establish a recommendation for usage of trinexapac-ethyl in <b>crimson</b> <b>clover</b> to maximize yield for seed growers in the Willamette Valley. Field trials were conducted at OSU’s Hyslop Experimental Farm, Corvallis, Oregon, in two growing seasons (2014 - 15 and 2015 - 16). Trinexapac-ethyl PGR application rates (140, 280, 420, and 560 g a. i. ha- 1) and timing [Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und CHemische Industrie (BBCH) stages 32 and 50] treatments and an untreated control were investigated. Seed yield was not significantly affected by PGR treatments, while seed weight was reduced in both growing seasons. Seed number m- 2 was significantly increased in the second growing season when mowing occurred. Both seed number and seed weight contributed to the stability in seed yield over years. Seed crops in both years were produced under extreme weather conditions where the first growing season was dry, while parts of the field in the second growing season were flooded. The number of inflorescence and florets m- 2 was higher in the second growing season, while the seed set was lower, thus, seed yields in the second year were lower. Under the extreme conditions of this study, trinexapac-ethyl was not beneficial for <b>crimson</b> <b>clover</b> seed yields but was effective as a lodging control agent...|$|E
40|$|Information on {{improved}} forages for goat grazing {{is lacking}} {{for the southern}} USA. Two cafeteria-style grazing trials were completed to determine preference of meat-type goats for cool-season annual clovers in Georgia. In both experiments, 8 replicates of 6 plots of clover cultivars were established, individually fenced, and grazed by Spanish goats for 48 hours during two grazing periods. Forage preference was determined by weighing strips of forage cut from plots pre- and post-grazing (Experiment 1) and by ocular scoring (1 = no grazing to 10 = completely grazed) after 4, 24 and 48 hours grazing (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, ‘Dixie’ and ‘AU Robin ’ <b>crimson</b> <b>clover</b> (Trifolium incarnatum L.) were most preferred, ‘AU Sunrise ’ <b>crimson</b> <b>clover</b> and ‘Yuchi ’ arrowleaf clover (Trifolium vesiculosum Savi) were intermediate, and ‘Segrest ’ ball clover (Trifolium nigrescens Viv.) and ‘R 18 ' rose clover (Trifolium hirtum All.) were least preferred. Forage preference was not influenced by dry matter yield, fibre content or protein concentration. In Experiment 2, Dixie and AU Sunrise <b>crimson</b> <b>clover</b> were most preferred in the first cutting, 3 arrowleaf clover types and ‘Americus ’ hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) were intermediate and R 18 rose clover was least preferred. When the <b>crimson</b> <b>clover</b> plots were not available for the second grazing period, the goats most preferred Yuchi arrowleaf clover, with ‘BYMV’ arrowleaf clover and hairy vetch intermediate, and rose clover least preferred. <b>Crimson</b> <b>clover</b> {{appears to be a}} useful forage for winter-spring grazing of goats in the southern USA...|$|E

5000|$|Some of {{the most}} famous {{electric}} guitarists of the day were keen to adopt the wah-wah pedal soon after its release. Among the very first recordings released featuring wah-wah pedal were [...] "Tales of Brave Ulysses" [...] by Cream with Eric Clapton on guitar and [...] "Burning of the Midnight Lamp" [...] by the Jimi Hendrix Experience, both released in 1967. Clapton, in particular, used the device on many of the Cream songs included on their second and third albums, Disraeli Gears (1967) and Wheels of Fire (1968) respectively. In fact, Clapton himself would subsequently employ it again on [...] "Wah-Wah", from his good friend George Harrison's solo album All Things Must Pass, upon the dissolution of The Beatles in 1970. Another prominent use occurred in the recording of <b>Crimson</b> and <b>Clover</b> by Tommy James and the Shondells in late 1968, with the single version eventually reaching number one in early 1969. Terry Kath, lead guitarist for the band Chicago, used it on many of their early recordings as well. Martin Barre, lead guitarist for the fledgling Jethro Tull, also employed it to great effect on their second album Stand Up, particularly on [...] "We Used to Know" [...] and [...] "Look into the Sun". Yet another famous guitarist, Jimmy Page, featured the wah-wah pedal on several songs from the final Yardbirds album Little Games, as well as the solo on the Led Zeppelin song [...] "Custard Pie", and throughout [...] "Trampled Underfoot", both from Physical Graffiti.

40|$|A {{three year}} field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the role of soil inversion, cover crops and spring tillage methods for Palmer amaranth between-row (BR) and within-row (WR) management in glufosinate-resistant cotton. Main plots were two soil inversion treatments: fall inversion tillage (IT) and non-inversion tillage (NIT). Subplots were three cover treatments: <b>crimson</b> <b>clover,</b> cereal rye or none (i. e., winter fallow); and the sub subplots were four secondary spring tillage methods: disking followed by (fb) cultivator (DCU), disking fb chisel plow (DCH), disking fb disking (DD) and no tillage (NT). Averaged over years and soil inversion, the <b>crimson</b> <b>clover</b> produced maximum cover biomass (4390 kg ha&# 8722; 1) fb cereal rye (3698 kg ha&# 8722; 1) and winter fallow (777 kg ha&# 8722; 1). Two weeks after planting (WAP) and before the postemergence (POST) application, Palmer amaranth WR and BR density were two- and four-times less, respectively, in IT than NIT. Further, Palmer amaranth WR and BR density were reduced two-fold following <b>crimson</b> <b>clover</b> and cereal rye than following winter fallow at 2 WAP. Without IT, early season Palmer amaranth densities were 40 % less following DCU, DCH and DD, when compared with IT. Following IT, no spring tillage method improved Palmer amaranth control. The timely application of glufosinate + S-metolachlor POST tank mixture greatly improved Palmer amaranth control in both IT and NIT systems. The highest cotton yields were obtained with DD following cereal rye (2251 kg ha&# 8722; 1), DD following <b>crimson</b> <b>clover</b> (2213 kg ha&# 8722; 1) and DD following winter fallow (2153 kg ha&# 8722; 1). On average, IT cotton yields (2133 kg ha&# 8722; 1) were 21 % higher than NIT (1766 kg ha&# 8722; 1). Therefore, from an integrated weed management standpoint, an occasional fall IT could greatly reduce Palmer amaranth emergence on farms highly infested with glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth. In addition, a cereal rye or <b>crimson</b> <b>clover</b> cover crop can effectively reduce early season Palmer amaranth emergence in both IT and NIT systems. For effective and season-long control of Palmer amaranth, one or more POST applications of glufosinate + residual herbicide as tank mixture may be needed in a glufosinate-based cotton production system...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Annual {{cover crops}} {{are widely used}} in the Willamette Valley of Oregon on hill land, in {{orchards}} and on overflow river bottom land. Cover crops are grown to prevent soil erosion and to increase soil organic matter. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the crops that would be most suitable as cover crops in the Willamette Valley as measured by their green and dry matter production at different times during the early spring. Twelve crop species including winter wheat, oats, barley, rye, annual brome and ryegrass, vetches, turnips, <b>crimson</b> and subterranean <b>clover</b> were seeded alone and in certain combinations on two different soil types near Corvallis, Oregon. The winter cereal grains produced the greatest amount of ground cover and green and dry matter at both locations. The cereal grain-legume mixtures were not significantly different from the pure stands of grain. During the season that this trial was conducted the Austrian winter peas were damaged by freezing, suggesting that this crop might have limited usefulness as a cover crop. Based on total production, Abruzzi rye, and the combination of Abruzzi rye and legumes were the most favorable crops to be used as cover crops at both locations. Annual ryegrass was comparable to Abruzzi rye and would certainly be useful under certain conditions...|$|R
60|$|Looking back at {{the great}} round hill from the village it is {{impossible}} not to notice the intense red colour of the road that winds over its green slope. One sometimes sees on a hillside a ploughed field of red earth which at a distance might easily be taken for a field of blossoming trifolium. Viewed nearer the <b>crimson</b> of the <b>clover</b> and red of the earth are very dissimilar; distance appears to intensify the red of the soil and to soften that of the flower until they are very nearly of the same hue. The road at Abbotsbury was near and looked to me more intensely red than any ordinary red earth, and the sight was strangely pleasing. These two complementary colours, red and green, delight us most when seen thus--a little red to {{a good deal of}} green, and the more luminous the red and vivid the green the better they please us. We see this in flowers--in the red geranium, for example--where there is no brown soil below, but green of turf or herbage. I sometimes think the red campions and ragged-robins are our most beautiful wild flowers when the sun shines level on the meadow and they are like crimson flowers among the tall translucent grasses. I remember the joy it was in boyhood in early spring when the flowers were beginning to bloom, when in our gallops over the level grass pampas we came upon a patch of scarlet verbenas. The first sight of the intense blooms scattered all about the turf would make us wild with delight, and throwing ourselves from our ponies we would go down among the flowers to feast on the sight.|$|R
30|$|The {{result of}} the present study on the fate of wild sorghum seed after 18 and 24  months of burial was in {{agreement}} with the results of Jacques et al. (1974) who did similar study in Kansas. They found that only few seeds of cultivated sorghum remained viable after four months of burial regardless of the burial depth, but some shatter cane seeds were able to survive for three years mostly from deeper burial depths (30  cm to 38  cm). The result was also intermediate between the results of Burnside et al. (1996) and Teo-Sherrell and Mortensen (2000). Burnside et al. (1996) found little viability in weedy sorghum seed after five years of burial, but they also observed 1 % germinated after 17  years of burial in eastern Nebraska. Teo-Sherrell and Mortensen (2000) reported more than 80 % mortality in weedy sorghum seed within three months after burial (between November and March) in Nebraska because of winter cold. However, such kind of winter environment of the temperate regions does not exist in most sorghum growing regions of Sub-Sahara Africa including Ethiopia. The observation that an increase in depth of burial increases longevity was in agreement with the previous reports in sorghum (Jacques et al. 1974), <b>crimson</b> and red <b>clovers</b> (Rampton and Ching 1970), in jointed goat grass (Donald and Zimdahl 1987), in wild oat (Miller and Nalewaja 1990), and in Amaranthus retroflexus seeds (Omami et al. 1999), to mention a few. This may be due mainly to the unavailability of suitable conditions for germination such as a decrease in oxygen content with increase in depth. In addition, seeds near the surface of the soil are more liable to natural predators and greater fluctuation in environmental conditions, which may contribute to faster rate of decay (Chantre et al. 2008).|$|R
