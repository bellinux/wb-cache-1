40|$|The {{canonical}} structural motif for co-ordination of non-haem {{ferrous iron}} in metal-dependent oxygenases is a facial triad of two histidine residues and one aspartate or glutamate residue. This so-called 2 -His- 1 -carboxylate metallocentre is often accommodated in a double-stranded Î²-helix fold with the iron-co-ordinating residues {{located in the}} rigid core structure of the protein. At the sequence level, the metal ligands are arranged in a HXD/E [...] . H motif (where {{the distance between the}} conserved histidine residues is variable). Interestingly, cysteine dioxygenase, among a growing number of other iron(II) oxygenases, has the carboxylate residue replaced by another histidine. In the present review, we compare the properties of 3 -His and 2 -His- 1 -carboxylate sites based on current evidence from high-resolution crystal structures, spectroscopic characterization of the metal centres and results from mutagenesis studies. Although the overall conformation of the two metal sites is quite similar, the carboxylate residue seems to accommodate a slightly closer <b>co-ordination</b> <b>distance</b> than the counterpart histidine. The ability of the 2 -His- 1 -carboxylate site to fit a site-directed substitution by an alternatively co-ordinating or non-co-ordinating residue with retention of metal-binding capacity and catalytic function varies among different enzymes. However, replacement by histidine disrupted the activity in the three iron(II) oxygenases examined so far...|$|E
40|$|The title {{compound}} {{has been}} synthesised and its structure determined by X-ray diffraction. The structure comprises a single strand polymer, with five independent Gd {{units in the}} crystallographic asymmetric unit. Each gadolinium atom has eight-coordinate bicapped trigonal prismatic geometry, co-ordinated by one terminal chlorine atom, four bridging chlorine atoms, two water molecules and one acetonitrile. Linkage to neighbouring metal centres is by double halogen bridges. The mean <b>co-ordination</b> <b>distances</b> are: Gd-Cl 2. 822 (bridging) and 2. 676 Angstrom (terminal), Gd-O, 2. 362 and Gd-N, 2. 538 Angstrom. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I will discuss {{interactivity}} and spatiality, including {{the relationships between}} technology-in-use, design and everyday practices. The paper reports some initial experiences from a field study at a technologyintensive control room and of using work-oriented approaches for collaborative design. In several studies a group of multidisciplinary researchers has carried out experiments of collaborative design in full-scale as well as virtual environments. The aim was to investigate how well these methods could support participatory design of work environments. Some important concerns I believe we need to face are how the characteristics of technology-enhanced environments may influence {{the development of new}} work practices when emergent technologies give entirely new possibilities for communication and <b>co-ordination</b> over extended <b>distances.</b> Hence, an urgent matter is to create a holistic view on design of future IT-enhanced work places that takes into account the u [...] ...|$|R
