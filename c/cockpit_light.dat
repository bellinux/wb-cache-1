50|$|The {{cargo door}} design flaw, and the {{consequences}} of a resulting in-flight decompression, had been noted by Convair engineer Dan Applegate in a 1972 memo. The memo was written after American Airlines Flight 96, another DC-10 experienced a rear cargo door failure identical to the one that occurred on Flight 981, also causing an explosive decompression. Fortunately, even though the pilot's ability to control Flight 96 was compromised by some severed underfloor cables in the blown-out section of the plane, they were able to land in Detroit without further injuries. The NTSB's investigation into Flight 96 determined that baggage handlers forced the locking handle closed, and the latches did not engaged fully because of an electrical problem. The incident investigators discovered that the rod connecting the pins to the handle was weak enough that it could be bent with repeated operation and force, allowing the baggage handler to close the handle with his knee even when the pins interfered with the torque tube flanges. The vent plug and <b>cockpit</b> <b>light</b> were operated by the handle or the locking pins, not the latches, so when the handle was stowed, both of these warning devices indicated that the door was properly closed. In the case of Flight 96, the plane was able to make a safe emergency landing because not all of the underfloor cables were severed, thus allowing the pilots limited control. This greatly contrasted with Flight 981, where all of the underfloor cables were severed in the decompression and the pilots lost complete control of the plane.|$|E
40|$|The F/A- 18 Night Vision Capability project {{consisted}} of the modification of F/A- 18 displays and <b>cockpit</b> <b>lighting</b> to be compatible with acquired AN/AVS- 9 G Night Vision Goggles (NVG). Aircraft lighting compatibility {{has been identified as}} a significant factor in a number of military aircraft accidents involving the use of NVG. As a result, careful consideration of the interaction of lighting system design, visual perception and human error is essential to assure safe and effective NVG operations. This paper describes the <b>cockpit</b> <b>lighting</b> modification and the design process used to develop an optimally integrated system...|$|R

5000|$|On February 25, 2014, a US Airways {{flight from}} New England to Philadelphia was {{diverted}} Tuesday morning, when <b>cockpit</b> <b>lights</b> indicated a mechanical issue. 42 passengers and three crew members were onboard, and no injury were reported during the emergency landing.|$|R
40|$|Aircraft <b>cockpit</b> <b>lighting</b> can {{interfere}} with the proper operation of night vision goggles (NVGs). Methods to verify compatibility between <b>cockpit</b> <b>lighting</b> and NVGs involve expensive equipment. An inexpensive alternative method to assess compatibility, that provides the same quality of results, is needed. Since {{the quality of the}} existing lighting compatibility methods has not been studied, it was necessary to determine the quality of existing methods and compare them to alternative methods using a night lighting simulator. The visual acuity-based evaluation method is relatively imprecise, but it can be implemented using alternative, inexpensive equipment and techniques. An alternative evaluation method, that makes use of the light output of the NVGs, looks promising. It provides a more precise acceptance/rejection criteria than the visual acuity method...|$|R
5000|$|Proper <b>cockpit</b> <b>lighting</b> is {{paramount}} in reducing fatigue since it inhibits {{the production of}} melatonin. Studies have shown that simply increasing lighting level to 100-200 lux improves alertness in the cockpit. 100 lux level {{is the same as}} room lighting and, therefore, would not affect pilot’s night vision.|$|R
5000|$|All {{cars were}} fitted with red, {{blue and yellow}} <b>cockpit</b> <b>lights.</b> The purpose was to give drivers {{information}} concerning track signals or conditions.

5|$|In January 2016 the Bild {{newspaper}} {{revealed that}} the newsest upgrade of the ASSTA suite to version 3.1, which includes color multifunctional LCD screens in place of monochrome CRT displays, is interferring with helmet-mounted nigh-vision optical displays worn by pilots, rendering German Tornado bombers deployed to Syria useless for night missions. The defense ministry admitted that bright <b>cockpit</b> <b>lights</b> could be a distraction for pilots, and disclosed that the solution will be implemented in a few weeks, but denied the need to fly night missions in Syria.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was also {{equipped with a}} larger instrument panel, roughly a third bigger than the OH-58A panel, which held larger flight instruments. The panel was also equipped with Night Vision Goggle (NVG) compatible <b>cockpit</b> <b>lighting.</b> The lights inside the aircraft are modified {{to prevent them from}} interfering with the aircrews' use of NVGs. OH-58C aircraft were also the first U.S. Army scout helicopter to be equipped with the AN/APR-39 radar detector, a system which allowed the crew to know when there were anti-aircraft radar systems in proximity to the aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|... 1972 May 10 : T-38 jet, {{electrical}} malfunction, out of fuel, ejected : Astronaut Charles [...] "Pete" [...] Conrad ejected safely {{from his}} NASA T-38 jet near Bergstrom AFB, Austin, TX. He landed about 90 {{meters from the}} base operations building. An electrical malfunction that caused loss of instruments during severe weather was listed by the review board as {{a major factor in}} the accident. Conrad was on a flight from Dover, DE via Dobbins AFB, GA to Ellington AFB, Houston, TX. Due to bad weather, he was diverted first to Hobby Airport, Houston because Ellington AFB was below minimums for landing. While on final approach to Hobby Airport, in darkness, heavy rain and lightning, the T-38 generator failed, causing a loss of <b>cockpit</b> <b>lighting</b> and partial loss of navigation instruments. Conrad broke off the approach and tried to climb above the bad weather. The generator was brought back online along with <b>cockpit</b> <b>lighting.</b> Because of the electrical problems, he requested a diversion to an airport that was under visual flight rules. Controllers sent him toward Randolph AFB, San Antonio, TX. It soon became apparent the T-38 did not have enough fuel to reach Randolph AFB. Controllers then diverted him to Bergstrom AFB. The T-38 ran out of fuel as it reached Bergstron AFB. Conrad ejected at 1100 meters. The aircraft was destroyed. He was taken to the base hospital for a routine examination and returned to Houston later that night.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} extend the {{effective}} operational lifespan of the type, some operators have carried out extensive upgrade programs of the G.222. In the aftermath of Italian humanitarian missions in Bosnia and Somalia, in 1996 the AMI began undertaking a major update program on their G.222 fleet; modifications include <b>cockpit</b> <b>lighting</b> changes for compatibility with Night Vision Goggles to enable night operations, increasing the aircraft's self-defense capabilities, new communications and navigation systems, {{and the removal of}} obsolete equipment. In July 2005, the Nigerian Air Force signed a $74.5 million contract with Alenia Aeronautica for the refurbishment of a total of five G.222s, as well as the purchase of a retired AMI G.222.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of the Chipmunk makes heavy use of metal, {{the majority of the}} airframe being composed of a stress-skinned alloy; this allowed the adoption of thinner wings and consequently provided for increased performance as well as a greater degree of durability. Numerous features were incorporated in order for the type to better perform in its trainer role, including hand-operated single-slotted wing flaps, anti-spin strakes, disc brakes on the wheeled undercarriage, a thin propeller composed of a solid lightweight alloy, the adoption of an engine-driven vacuum pump in place of external venture tubes to power cockpit instrumentation, electric and Coffman cartridge engine starters as alternative options, <b>cockpit</b> <b>lighting,</b> onboard radio system, and an external identification light underneath the starboard wing.|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} the accident, a two engine turboprop, was known to have a right engine that ran hotter and used more fuel in flight than the left engine. In addition to the high fuel flow and oil temperature in the right engine, the aircraft had poor <b>cockpit</b> <b>lighting</b> at night. Observation flights by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators found that errors in flap settings due to poor lighting were common on Twin Otters during night flights. The area around the flap control overhead was not illuminated; and the flap position indicator on the windscreen center post was poorly illuminated {{to the point of}} being barely visible. Some of the lights in the engine gauges had been incorrectly replaced with red, instead of white bulbs, making the gauges hard to see. Pilots had requested the maintenance crew standardize on one color of light bulb, but this had not been done at the time of the accident. Among Downeast pilots, there was discussion of the first officer's altimeter sticking and indicating as much as a 100 ft (30m) difference in altitude compared to the pilot's altimeter during descent and ascent. There was no formal record of the altimeter problem in the aircraft's logbooks, but investigators were told that it had been checked during an inspection in the past with no defects found.|$|R
