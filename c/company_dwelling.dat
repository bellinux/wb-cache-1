50|$|The slow take-up of {{available}} homes in Noel Park, particularly {{due to the}} Great Eastern Railway's refusal to offer third-class rail fares from the nearby Noel Park and Wood Green station, led the Company to begin building centrally located tenement blocks more {{similar to those of}} other model <b>dwellings</b> <b>companies.</b> Between 1885 and 1892, the Artizans <b>Company</b> built 1,467 <b>dwellings</b> in Central London and the West End, the first being the Portman Buildings in Lisson Grove, Marylebone, opened in 1888.|$|R

The movement picked up pace again after the Act, which granted local authorities the right to clear slum dwellings, however the entrepreneurial focus of the companies was restricted by an inability to make a competitive return and the intervention of large-scale municipal housing. The most successful builders post-1875 were those making a smaller return, such as the Four Per Cent Industrial <b>Dwellings</b> <b>Company,</b> and the East End <b>Dwellings</b> <b>Company,</b> often founded on religious principles as much as commercial.|$|R

50|$|The largest MDC {{working in}} central London was the Improved Industrial <b>Dwellings</b> <b>Company</b> (IIDC), founded by Sir Sydney Waterlow in 1863, which housed around 30,000 {{individuals}} by 1900.

5|$|The philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts {{was active}} in the East End, {{alleviating}} poverty by founding a sewing school for ex-weavers in Spitalfields and building the ornate Columbia Market in Bethnal Green. She helped to inaugurate the London Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, was a keen supporter of the 'Ragged School Union', and operated housing schemes {{similar to those of the}} Model <b>Dwellings</b> <b>Companies</b> such as the East End <b>Dwellings</b> <b>Company</b> and the Four Per Cent Industrial <b>Dwellings</b> <b>Company,</b> where investors received a financial return on their philanthropy. Between the 1890s and 1903, when the work was published, the social campaigner Charles Booth instigated an investigation into the life of London poor (based at Toynbee Hall), much of which was centred on the poverty and conditions in the East End. Further investigations were instigated by the 'Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09', the Commission found it difficult to agree, beyond that change was necessary and produced separate minority and majority reports. The minority report was the work of Booth with the founders of the London School of Economics Sidney and Beatrice Webb. They advocated focusing on the causes of poverty and the radical notion of poverty being involuntary, rather than the result of innate indolence. At the time their work was rejected but was gradually adopted as policy by successive governments.|$|R
