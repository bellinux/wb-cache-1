To describe the optical radiation field a model based on microwave theory was developed, and the optical waveguide-modes were determined.

The results reveal extensive structural re-arrangements in the internal wall of the tail tube.

Case reportA patient with sick sinus syndrome underwent implantation of a 5 mm unipolar atrial lead, mated to a 5 / 6 mm connector port Medtronic Spectrax Sx 5985 pacemaker.

She was admitted in 2010 for atrial lead non capture from blood leak and corrosion of the header-connector pin apparatus. Discussion 5 / 6 mm pacemaker header ports have a 5 mm flexible sealing ring at the port entrance to seal 5 mm or 6 mm <b>lead</b> <b>connector</b> pins. The inner barrel diameter of the connector port is 6 mm and insertion of a 5 mm lead results in a 0. 5 mm tolerance circumferentially. Should the seal be compromised, blood can corrode the apparatus. To minimize this, we can employ (a) a cinching tie to further seal the silicone ring (b) universal adaptor sleeves (c) splice kits (d) lead adaptor kits. Aging leads, adaptor kits or sleeves themselves can result in lead failure. It may be safer to re-implant the entire system.

40|$|BIP is a {{component}} framework for constructing systems by superposing three layers of modeling: Behavior, Interaction, and Priority. Behavior {{is represented by}} labeled transition systems communicating through ports. Interactions are sets of ports. A synchronization between components is possible through the interactions specified {{by a set of}} connectors. When several interactions are possible, priorities allow to restrict the non-determinism by choosing an interaction, which is maximal according to some given strict partial order. The BIP component framework has been implemented in a language and a tool-set. The execution of a BIP program is driven by a dedicated engine, which has access to the set of connectors and priority model of the program. A key performance issue is the computation of the set of possible interactions of the BIP program from a given state. Currently, the choice of the interaction to be executed involves a costly exploration of enumerative representations for <b>connectors.</b> This <b>leads</b> to a considerable overhead in execution times. In this paper, we propose a symbolic implementation of the execution model of BIP, which drastically reduces this overhead. The symbolic implementation is based on computing boolean representation for components, connectors, and priorities with an existing BDD package. ...|$|R
40|$|Sandwich constructions made of thin metal {{sheets and}} {{structural}} concrete have been reliable and economic composite {{structures in the}} past decades. The application of thin-walled facings made of Textile Reinforced Concrete (TRC) combines the advantages of these constructions and allows for slender construction thicknesses despite the progressing demands on thermal insulation. However, the design principles of the common structures {{as well as the}} connecting devices of structural concrete panels are not applicable offhand for TRC. The experimental investigations examine the load-bearing behaviour of the components e. g. TRC-facings, core foams and connecting devices made of FRP as well as the load-bearing behaviour of assembled sandwich sections subjected to tensile, shear and bending forces. The load-bearing behaviour of sandwich members without connectors is determined by stiffness and strength of the core material and the bond strength between concrete and core which is depending on the applied production method. The application of <b>connectors</b> <b>leads</b> to higher load-bearing capacities and ductility. While pin-connectors with a low bending rigidity predominantly add tensile capacity and stiffness, the shear grids made of carbon fibres contribute to the capacity, stiffness and ductility under tensile, shear and flexural loading in equal sense. Non-linear numerical simulations are conducted to investigate methodically the influences of decisive parameters. Material models including the damage formulation for the components core, connectors, textile reinforcement, concrete as well as the bond between foam and concrete have been developed and calibrated on the basis of material tests and own experiments. Based on the contact models for the bond, an extended model is derived to consider both the shear cracking and the debonding of the core allowing for an appropriate description of the failure of the shear grid. The parameter calculations reveal that shear grid and core establish a truss action under shear loading depending on the stiffness of the core. Based on the theory of STAMM/WITTE an extended model for sandwich construction made of TRC is developed which appropriately describes the load-bearing behaviour under tensile, shear and flexural loading. The contributions of core and connecting devices are formulated by elastic spring models and also the influence of the cracking of the faces on the deformation of the panel is considered. Experimental and numerical results are in good accordance with the derived model. For the practical application constant and linear strain changes of the facings (temperature and shrinkage) as well as distributed loads {{have been added to the}} model and a design concept is proposed. The applicability of these models is proven by prototype applications of a sandwich façade and a modular building made of structural TRC sandwich panels...|$|R

The issue of connector ductility becomes especially important when partial shear connection is adopted, as premature failure of the shear <b>connectors</b> would <b>lead</b> to sudden failure of the composite beam. This chapter presents its findings on the effect of transverse reinforcement on connector ductility and proposes design equations. Transverse reinforcement is used to provide ties for the slabs and confined concrete from splitting. The ductility of the shear connector, that is, slip capacity is directly affected by the amount of transverse reinforcement. Design equations presented in this chapter for estimating the shear capacity of the headed shear stud show a good correlation with the push-off test results. For full shear connection design, pre-splitting shear capacity of the headed stud can be used for the composite design, while for partial shear connection design, post-splitting shear capacity of the headed stud should be used.
