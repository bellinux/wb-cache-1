6000|$|One morning--four days ago--I {{went to see}} Tengga. I {{found him}} by the shore {{trimming}} a plank with a small hatchet while a slave held an umbrella over his head. He is amusing himself in building a boat just now. He threw his hatchet down to meet me and led me by the hand to a shady spot. He told me frankly he had sent out two good swimmers to observe the stranded vessel. These men stole down the creek in a canoe and when on the sea coast swam from sandbank to sandbank until they approached unobserved--I think--to about fifty yards from that schooner What can that craft be? I can't make it out. The men reported there were three chiefs on board. One with a glittering eye, one a lean man in white, and another without any hair on the face and dressed in a different style. Could it be a woman? I don't know what to think. I wish you were here. After a lot of chatter Tengga said: [...] "Six years ago I was ruler of a country and the Dutch drove me out. The country was small but nothing is too small for them to take. They pretended {{to give it back}} to my nephew--may he burn! I ran away or they would have killed me. I am nothing here--but I remember. These white people out there <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>run</b> away and they are very few. There is perhaps a little to loot. I would give it to my men who followed me in my calamity because I am their chief and my father was the chief of their fathers." [...] I pointed out the imprudence of this. He said: [...] "The dead do not show the way." [...] To this I remarked that the ignorant do not give information. Tengga kept quiet for a while, then said: [...] "We must not touch them because their skin is like yours and to kill them would be wrong, but at the bidding of you whites we may go and fight with people of our own skin and our own faith--and that is good. I have promised to Tuan Lingard twenty men and a prau to make war in Wajo. The men are good and look at the prau; it is swift and strong." [...] I must say, Tom, the prau is the best craft of the kind I have ever seen. I said you paid him well for the help. [...] "And I also would pay," [...] says he, [...] "if you let me have a few guns and a little powder for my men. You and I shall share the loot of that ship outside, and Tuan Lingard will not know. It is only a little game. You have plenty of guns and powder under your care." [...] He meant in the Emma. On that I spoke out pretty straight and we got rather warm until at last he gave me to understand that as he had about forty followers of his own and I had only nine of Hassim's chaps to defend the Emma with, he could very well go for me and get the lot. [...] "And then," [...] says he, [...] "I would be so strong that everybody would be on my side." [...] I discovered in the course of further talk that there is a notion amongst many people that you have come to grief in some way and won't show up here any more. After this I saw the position was serious and I was {{in a hurry to get}} back to the Emma, but pretending I did not care I smiled and thanked Tengga for giving me warning of his intentions about me and the Emma. At this he nearly choked himself with his betel quid and fixing me with his little eyes, muttered: [...] "Even a lizard will give a fly the time to say its prayers." [...] I turned my back on him and was very thankful to get beyond the throw of a spear. I haven't been out of the Emma since.|$|E

Having FPGA fabric tiles in such MPSoC platform increases performance and flexibility of the platform. Such FPGA tiles <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>run</b> tasks in hardware but also instantiate a soft IP core that executes the task functionality. Thus fully exploiting the available FPGA fabric resources must include exploiting such a hierarchical configuration. This paper details the benefits of using a hierarchical configuration and illustrates how to incorporate it within a generic run-time task assignment heuristic. We show that adding a hierarchical configuration significantly improves task assignment performance (i. e. success rate and assignment quality). In several cases, the performance of a heuristic with a hierarchical configuration extends beyond the capabilities of a full solution space exploration without hierarchical configuration, at {{only a fraction of the}} computation time. 1...|$|R

It was found that ovality increases linearly with tubular expansion ratio. With increase in expansion ratio, the tubular contact length with formation and developed contact pressure increases. Tubular ovality, if not considered in well design, may lead to premature tubular failure due to lower collapse rating and higher stresses...|$|R
