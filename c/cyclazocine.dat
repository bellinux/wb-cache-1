5000|$|... 8-Carboxamidocyclazocine (8-CAC) is an opioid {{analgesic}} drug related to <b>cyclazocine,</b> invented by medicinal chemist Mark P. Wentland and co-workers in Cogswell Laboratory at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Similarly to <b>cyclazocine,</b> 8-CAC {{acts as an}} agonist at both the μ and κ opioid receptors, but has a much longer duration of action than <b>cyclazocine,</b> and does not have μ antagonist activity. Unexpectedly {{it was discovered that}} the phenolic hydroxyl group of <b>cyclazocine</b> could be replaced by a carboxamido group with only slight loss of potency at opioid receptors, and this discovery has subsequently been used to develop a large number of novel opioid derivatives where the phenolic hydroxy group has been replaced by either carboxamide or a variety of larger groups. Due to their strong κ-opioid agonist activity, these drugs are not suited for use as analgesics in humans, but have instead been researched as potential drugs for the treatment of cocaine addiction.|$|E

50|$|Research {{into the}} use of <b>cyclazocine</b> for the {{treatment}} of bipolar patients with depression was undertaken by Fink and colleagues (1970). It showed that 8 out of 10 patients experienced moderate improvement.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyclazocine</b> {{is a mixed}} opioid agonist/antagonist {{related to}} dezocine, {{pentazocine}} and phenazocine. This family of opioid drugs is called the benzomorphans or benzazocines. It is a KOR agonist and MOR partial agonist, and also has high affinity for the DOR.|$|E
50|$|In testing {{narcotic}} antagonists (naloxone, <b>cyclazocine)</b> and opioid substitutes (methadone, levomethadyl) in {{the treatment}} of opioid dependence, the quantitative EEG experiments showed the efficiency of antagonistic and replacement activity of different dosing schedules. Dose finding trials of naloxone showed no specific CNS effect when administered alone but very effective antagonistic action in opioid dose and overdose.|$|E
50|$|Ciprefadol is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{that is an}} isoquinoline derivative most closely related to <b>cyclazocine</b> and picenadol, {{with a number of}} other related compounds known. Ciprefadol is a mixed agonist-antagonist at μ-opioid receptors and can partly block the effects of morphine at low doses, though at higher doses it acts more like a full agonist. It is also a potent κ-opioid agonist, unlike the corresponding N-methyl and N-phenethyl derivatives which are reasonably μ-selective agonists.|$|E
50|$|Research {{during the}} 1960s and 1970s into the {{possible}} use of <b>cyclazocine</b> for management of pain, and later for assisting treatment of narcotic addiction was severely {{hampered by the}} drug's psychotomimetic, dysphoric, and hallucinatory effects. The dysphoric/anxiety inducing effects the drug correlate with increasing dosage and would likely {{reduce the risk of}} abuse {{in the same manner as}} other opioids which preferentially act on the KOR versus the DOR. and MOR, although the side-effect threshold is often lower than the lowest effective dose.|$|E
50|$|Pentazocine is a synthetically-prepared prototypical mixed agonist-antagonist {{narcotic}} (opioid analgesic) drug of the benzomorphan {{class of}} opioids {{used to treat}} moderate to moderately severe pain. Pentazocine is sold under several brand names, such as Fortral, Sosegon, Talwin NX (with the μ-antagonist naloxone, will cause withdrawal in opioid dependent persons on injection), Talwin, Talwin PX (without naloxone), Fortwin (Lactate injectable form) and Talacen (with acetaminophen). This compound may exist as one of two enantiomers, named (+)-pentazocine and (−)-pentazocine. (−)-pentazocine is a κ-opioid receptor agonist, while (+)-pentazocine is not, instead displaying a ten-fold greater affinity for the σ receptor. Usually, in its oral formulations, it is combined with naloxone so as to prevent people from crushing the tablets, dissolving them in a solvent (like water) and injecting them for a high (as naloxone is not orally bioavailable it produces no effect when the formulation is used orally, but it blocks the opioid effects of pentazocine if injected intravenously for a high). Related drugs include phenazocine, dezocine, <b>cyclazocine</b> and several chemicals used in research on the central nervous system.|$|E
40|$|Separate {{groups of}} rats {{were trained to}} {{discriminate}} the narcotic agonist-antagonist, <b>cyclazocine</b> (1. 25 mg/kg), from saline or the pure narcotic agonist, morphine (10 mg/kg), from saline. In the <b>cyclazocine</b> discriminating animals, the interoceptive stimuli produced by <b>cyclazocine</b> {{were found to be}} dose related and largely based on central opiate systems in that these effects were reversed by the narcotic antagonist, naloxone. The discriminative stimulus produced by <b>cyclazocine</b> was found to be completely generalized to nalorphine, ethylketocyclazocine, pentazocine and morphine while a lesser degree of generalization was seen to the experimental compounds, U- 49, 274 A and U- 50, 788 E. The <b>cyclazocine</b> discriminative stimulus did not generalize to apomorphine, d-amphetamine, haloperidol, d-butaclamol, 1 -butaclamol, clonidine, desipramine, amitriptyline, aceperone and butorphanol. <b>Cyclazocine</b> generalization to morphine was completely antagonized by naloxone at a dose one-twentieth that required to antagonize the <b>cyclazocine</b> discriminative stimulus itself. At no dose tested did naloxone completely antagonize <b>cyclazocine</b> generalization to nalorphine. A possible dopaminergic component of the <b>cyclazocine</b> discriminative stimulus was demonstrated by attenuation of stimulus strength with the neuroleptics haloperidol, benperidol and d-butaclamol. The discriminative stimulus produced by morphine was also found to be a dose related effect based upon central opiate mechanisms as demonstrated by naloxone reversibility. The discriminative stimulus produced by morphine only partially generalized to <b>cyclazocine</b> and ethylketocyclazocine. Naloxone antagonized the generalization of morphine to <b>cyclazocine</b> but at a dose four times that required to antagonize the morphine discriminative stimulus itself. A possible dopaminergic component of the morphine discriminative stimulus was demonstrated by haloperidol attenuation of stimulus strength. <b>Cyclazocine</b> analgesia, demonstrated using the mouse tail flick procedure, was found to be maximal approximately five minutes following <b>cyclazocine</b> administration. Some analgesic potency was also ~easurable 35 minutes post <b>cyclazocine.</b> The analgesic effects of <b>cyclazocine</b> were found to be reversed by naloxone.

The generalization gradient of <b>cyclazocine</b> and of l-NANM, but not that of ketamine, was less steep than the gradient of morphine. <b>Cyclazocine</b> and l-NANM, but not U 50, 488 and ketamine, antagonized partially the discriminative stimulus (DS) effects of morphine. Naltrexone antagonized the DS effects of morphine, <b>cyclazocine,</b> and l-NANM, but not ketamine. Increasing the training dose of morphine shifted the morphine gradient to the right, increased the antagonist effects of <b>cyclazocine</b> and of l-NANM, and decreased their agonist effects, but did not alter the effects of ketamine.

40|$|Results {{of studies}} on the discriminative {{stimulus}} effects of narcotics {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that multiple receptors mediate the effects of these compounds. In the rat, at least three subsets of discriminative effects exist, although some drugs appear to have effects that transcend more than one subset. The discriminative effects of morphine-like narcotics ([mu] agonists), for example, are often clearly distinguishable from the discriminative effects produced by [kappa] agonists, such as ketazocine, and from those produced by phencyclidine-like agonists, such as SKF- 10, 047 and <b>cyclazocine.</b> <b>Cyclazocine,</b> however, has been reported to have discriminative effects in common with morphine (45) and fentanyl (17) and appears to have [kappa]-like, in addition to phencyclidine-like, discriminative effects. The relative ability of pure narcotic antagonists to block the discriminative effects of these compounds also provides evidence for distinct pharmacologic actions of these drugs. In the rat, the discriminative effects of morphine are blocked by doses of naloxone that are considerably smaller than those that are needed to block the discriminative effects of <b>cyclazocine</b> (44).

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{describe}} the activity of a set of opioid drugs, including partial agonists, in a cell system expressing only mu opioid receptors. Receptor activation was assessed by measuring the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic adenosine mono phosphate (cAMP) production. Efficacies and potencies of these ligands were determined relative to the endogenous ligand β-endorphin and the common mu agonist, morphine. Results Among the ligands studied naltrexone, WIN 44, 441 and SKF 10047, were classified as antagonists, while the remaining ligands were agonists. Agonist efficacy was assessed by determining the extent of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. The rank order of efficacy of the agonists was fentanyl = hydromorphone = β-endorphin > etorphine = lofentanil = butorphanol = morphine = nalbuphine = nalorphine > <b>cyclazocine</b> = dezocine = metazocine ≥ xorphanol. The rank order of potency of these ligands was different from that of their efficacies; etorphine > hydromorphone > dezocine > xorphanol = nalorphine = butorphanol = lofentanil > metazocine > nalbuphine > <b>cyclazocine</b> > fentanyl > morphine >>>> β-endorphin. Conclusion These results elucidate the relative activities of a set of opioid ligands at mu opioid receptor and can serve as the initial step in a systematic study leading to understanding of the mode of action of opioid ligands at this receptor. Furthermore, these results can assist in understanding the physiological effect of many opioid ligands acting through mu opioid receptors. </p...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{the optical}} isomers of {{pentazocine}} and <b>cyclazocine</b> upon responding maintained by second-order schedules of intravenous morphine reinforcement in squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus). Monkeys were trained under schedules in which either every 10 th (FR 10) or 30 th (FR 30) response during a fixed-interval of 50 min (FI 50 min) produced a brief {{presentation of an}} external signal (S), unaccompanied by an injection;. the first ratio-requirement completed after expiry of the FI produced the signal (S) accompanied by an i. v. infusion of morphine. Morphine pretreatment (1 - 5. 6 mg/kg i. m.) suppressed drug-seeking behaviour in a dose-dependent manner. Naloxone pretreatment (0. 1 mg/kg) when given alone exerted no effect on response-rate; when given in combination with graded doses of morphine, morphine-induced suppression of drug-seeking behaviour was antagonized. 1 -Pentazocine (0. 1 - 10 mg/kg i. m.) pretreatment suppressed responding more effectively than d-pentazocine at equivalent doses. 1 -Cyclazocine (0. 01 - 1. 0 mg/kg i. m.) suppressed responding whereas d-cyclazocine at equivalent doses did not.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was {{to examine the effects of}} mu (μ), kappa (κ) and sigma (o) agents namely, morphine (μ), ethylketocyclazocine (κ), SKF 10, 047 (σ), pentazocine (κ, o), <b>cyclazocine</b> (κ, σ) and the mu antagonists, naloxone and naltrexone on dopamine mediated behaviors and the development of haloperidol-induced dopaminergic supersensitivity (DA-SS) in the mouse. Three behavioral paradigms were utilized which are predictive of mesolimbic and/or striatal dopaminergic effects: locomotor activity (mesolimbic); apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior (striatal) and apomorphineinduced climbing behavior (mesolimbic/striatal). Morphine, SKF 10, 047, pentazocine and <b>cyclazocine</b> produced increases in locomotor activity suggesting increased dopaminergic activity, while naloxone and naltrexone had no effect on locomotion. Ethylketocyclazocine (EKC) induced a biphasic effect of sedation followed by an increase in locomotor activity at three hours post administration. EKC and SKF 10, 047 antagonized apomorphine-induced climbing because of motor deficits, sedation and ataxia, respectively, while the other opiates had no effect. Only EKC inhibited apomorphine-induced stereotypy, due to initial motor deficits and sedation. Thus, these compounds were not dopamine antagonists, insofar as apomorphine-induced behaviors were only antagonized at debilitating doses which incapacitated mice. Furthermore, both EKC and SKF 10, 047 increased locomotion, unlike neuroleptics which generally cause motor depression. The stimulant properties of the κ and α opiates warranted further investigation. EKC at 5 mg/kg sc produced a biphasic effect over time with a peak effect from 180 to 210 minutes. EKC (5 mg/kg) hyperactivity was dependent upon catecholamine synthesis and transmission since a -MPT (300 mg/kg), reserpine (5 mg/kg), tetrabenazine (5, 40 mg/kg), haloperidol (1 mg/kg), apomorphine (0. 1 mg/kg), muscimol (1 mg/kg) and prazosin (2. 5 mg/kg) blocked EKC-induced locomotor activity. SKF 10, 047 at 40 mg/kg sc not only increased locomotor activity but also induced stereotypy and climbing behavior with an ED 50 for climbing at 90 minutes equal to 14. 6 mg/kg sc. SKF 10, 047 (40 mg/kg) -induced climbing was dependent on catecholamine transmission and a direct serotonin receptor interaction since α -MPT (300 mg/kg), tetrabenazine (5, 40 mg/kg), haloperidol (1 mg/kg), apomorphine (0. 1 mg/kg), muscimol (1 mg/kg), prazosin (2. 5 mg/kg) and methysergide (10 mg/kg) antagonized this behavior. Both EKC-induced hyperactivity and SKF 10, 047 -induced climbing were not antagonized by naloxone (10, 100 mg/kg). Furthermore, naloxone, EKC and SKF 10, 047 potentiated apomorphine-induced climbing. The μ, κ, σ and mixed K, σ agents all produced effects suggesting dopaminergic activity, i. e., locomotion, stereotypy, climbing and potentiation of apomorphine effects. Therefore, each was tested for its ability to attenuate haloperidol-induced DA-SS in the climbing and stereotyped behavior paradigms. In the acute climbing paradigm, haloperidol-induced DA-SS was dose-dependently attenuated by SKF 10, 047, EKC, <b>cyclazocine,</b> pentazocine, naloxone and naltrexone, with morphine inactive. In the chronic (5 -day) climbing and stereotypy models, only the concomitant administration of either SKF 10, 047 or <b>cyclazocine</b> and haloperidol inhibited the development of DA-SS, while morphine alone produced DA-SS. These results suggest differential opiate modulation of DA-SS in the acute vs. chronic paradigms. Furthermore, sigma agonists were most effective in attenuating haloperidol-induced DA-SS, presumably through dopamine agonist properties...|$|E

In mice or rats, an injection of morphine one minute prior to testing antagonized some of the agonistic activity of a dose of morphine given 19 minutes earlier in the tail-flick test. A second injection of morphine or meperidine, but not of levorphanol, antagonized some of the agonistic effects of a previous injection of the same drug in the mouse hot-plate test. Initial reports suggested that although the narcotic antagonist analgesics acted similarly to the narcotic analgesics in man (Lasagna and Beecher, 1954; Keats and Telford, 1956, 1964), they had different pharmacological profiles in laboratory animals (Harris and Pierson, 1964...|$|E
40|$|A specific, {{sensitive}} and aide procedure for the extraction from plasma and determination by gas chromatography of benzomorphan derivatives is presented. Be~omorphana (BM) derivatives are compounds with strong analgesic proper-ties (1). In recent years pentazocine (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexahydro- 6, 11 -dimnthyl- 3 -(3 -m~thyl- 2 -butenyl) - 2, 6 -methano- 3 -benzazocin- 8 -ol), a BM derivative is being increasingly used therapeutically. The estimation of thin drug was achieved using apectrophotofluorootetry (2) and gas chromatography (3). This communica-tion describes an analytical procedure for {{the determination of}} several BM derivatives: pentasocine, <b>cyclazocine</b> (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexahydro- 6, 11 -dimethyl- 3 -cyclopropylmethyl- 2, 6 -methano- 3 -benzasocin- 8 -ol), phenazocine (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...|$|E
40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that acute morphine administration markedly enhances naloxone-induced increases in serum lutein-izing hormone (LH) {{levels in the}} male rat. The purposes of the present studies were to determine whether this effect was opiate-specific and, if so, whether it was mediated by mu, kappa or sigma opiate receptors. In agreement with our previous re-ports, we found that naloxone-induced increases in serum LH levels were markedly enhanced (> 400 %) in morphine-pretreated rats, relative to controls, 6 to 8 hr after a single injection; furthermore, similar effects were observed with all mu agonists assessed with the order of potency being etorphine> levor-phanol> morphine> methadone> codeine. In contrast, {{we were unable to}} demonstrate any enhancement of the effects of naloxone on serum LH levels by ketocyclazocine, <b>cyclazocine</b> o...|$|E

Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) {{was used as}} a nociceptive stimulus intradermally in the guinea pig. The responses evoked by EDTA included vocalization, biting and scratching at the site of injection and escape behavior. Nociception by EDTA was shown {{to be the result of}} its cation chelating activity. The suppression of EDTA-induced responses proved to be a rapid and effective antinociceptive test. The narcotic analgesics morphine, codeine, meperidine and methadone and the narcotic antagonist analgesics <b>cyclazocine,</b> cycborphan, naborphine and pentazocine were active. The slopes of the dose-response curves of the narcotic antagonist analgesics were significantly shallower than those of the narcotic analgesics. The test was highly analgesics and various nonanalgesic drug...|$|E
40|$|The present studies {{characterized}} the receptor mechanisms of morphine-induced states of memory. Morphine (5 mg/kg) produced {{a state in}} which rats could learn and retrieve an operant response; retrieval was impaired, however, when the rats were tested in the normal state. Conversely, rats that were trained in the normal state failed to retrieve the response in the morphine state. In either case the mnesic state was dose dependent, commencing at morphine doses as low as 0. 8 mg/kg. In rats trained with 5 mg/kg of morphine, retrieval was fully adequate when tested with this same dose but not when tested with either lower or higher doses. Naloxone, but not naltrindole, antagonized the morphine-induced state; heroin and (�) <b>cyclazocine,</b> but not U 50, 488 H, (�) -cyclazocine and SNC 80, produced a state in which retrieval occurred at least partially. Time-effect studies in which injections were made from 0 to 24...|$|E

Ther. 195 : 271 - 278, 1975. A pattern of lever pressing and schedule-induced polydipsia was maintained in rats by a fixed-interval 90 -second schedule of food presentation. The effects of acute morphine, methadone, nalorphine, naloxone, pentazocine and <b>cyclazocine</b> were studied in control rats (morphine-free rats) and in rats maintained on 200 mg/kg daily oral injections of morphine (morphine-maintained rats). The effects of morphine, nalorphine and naloxone also were studied in rats that were drinking a 0. 5 mg/ml of morphine solution (morphine-drinking rats) {{in the experimental}} apparatus. All six drugs decreased drinking in the morphine-free rats. Pentazocine and naloxone increased lever-pressing rates in the morphine-free rats, while morphine, methadone, nalorphine and cyclazo-cine only decreased lever-pressing rates. In the morphine-maintained rats, the dose-effect curves for both lever-pressing and drinking measures were shifted to the lef...|$|E
40|$|Several psychotomimetic {{phencyclidine}} (PCP) analogs [...] N-ethyl-l-phenylcyclohexylamine (PCE), N-[1 -(2 -thienyl) cyclohexyl]piperidine (TCP), N-[1 -(thienyl) cyclohexyl)) pyrrolidine (THP), ketamine, and N,N-dimethyl-l-phenyl-cyclohexylamine (PCDEA) [...] {{were tested}} on basilar and middle cerebral arteries {{of the dog}} in vitro and found to induce contraction in these blood vessels with a maximal contractile activity (i. e., intrinsic activity) {{similar to that of}} PCP. The concentration-effect curves of these compounds were found to be parallel to the curve of PCP (P less than 0. 01). The relative potency was PCE greater than TCP greater than PCP greater than THP greater than PCDEA greater than ketamine. A PCP analog with no psychotomimetic activity, 1 -piperidinocyclohexanecarbonitrile (PCC), did not induce the blood vessels to contract, nor did the opiate morphine. Three psychotomimetic benzomorphans [...] pentazocine, <b>cyclazocine,</b> and N-allylnorcyclazocine [...] were found to: (i) also produce contraction; and (ii) have concentration [...] effect curves parallel to the curve of PCP, but with reduced intrinsic activities (i. e., maximal tensions were lowered) compared to PCP. A kappa opiate, ethylketocyclazocine, relaxed the blood vessels in a dose-dependent manner. This study provides direct evidence for a distinct PCP receptor on cerebral blood vessels and suggests that certain benzomorphans may produce cerebral vasospasm via PCP-receptor interactions...|$|E
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{addition of}} [D-Ala 2, D-Leu 5]-enkephalin and morphiceptin at concentrations at which 98 % of enkephalin (delta) and morphine (mu) receptors are occupied only partially inhibits the binding of [3 H]diprenorphine to rat brain membranes. These conditions, furthermore, do {{not affect the}} curves for displacement of [3 H]diprenorphine binding by unlabeled diprenorphine. These data suggest that [3 H]diprenorphine binds to a third subtype of opiate binding site, which has high affinity for diprenorphine but very low affinity for mu and delta agonists. The [3 H]-diprenorphine binding observed {{in the presence of}} morphiceptin and [D-Ala 2, D-Leu 5]enkephalin exhibits high affinity for several benzomorphan drugs in the chemical family of 6, 7 -benzomorphan (e. g., <b>cyclazocine,</b> ethylketocyclazocine, SKF 10047, UM 1072, oxilorphan, etc). Because of its selectivity for most benzomorphan drugs, this putative receptor site is tentatively referred to as a benzomorphan binding site. Its regional distribution in rat brain {{is similar to that of}} morphine (mu) receptors but differs from that for enkephalin (delta) receptors. The content of benzomorphan binding sites in rat brain is only one-half to one-third that of morphine receptors. The relative affinities of various opioids to morphine enkephalin, and benzomorphan binding sites are also described...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} of morphine to suppress natural and precipitated withdrawal was compared in morphine-dependent rhesus monkeys. A similar severity of withdrawal was induced by 14 -hr deprivation or precipitated by naloxone, naltrexone, <b>cyclazocine,</b> Win 44, 441 or MR 2266. Regardless {{of the procedure}} used to induce withdrawal, behavioral signs were completely suppressed by a cumulative dose of 17. 5 mg/kg morphine. Thus, an equivalent level of withdrawal induced by reversible antagonists is as sensitive to subsequent morphine administration as is deprivation-induced abstinence. This is {{in accordance with the}} theory that vacancy of opiate receptors normally occupied by morphine is related to the level of abstinence observed. In contrast to Win 44, 441, however, an equivalent level of withdrawal precipitated by buprenorphine required 175 mg/kg morphine for complete suppression. This is more informative than comparing duration of action; when given as 24 -h pretreatments, a high dose of Win 44, 441 (10 mg/kg) was only slightly less effective than buprenorphine (3. 2 mg/kg) in antagonizing morphine-induced stupor in normal monkeys. Comparison of the ability of morphine to suppress precipitated withdrawal provides evidence of the relative reversibility of antagonists and demonstrates the extraordinarily stable nature by which buprenorphine acts at opiate receptors...|$|E
