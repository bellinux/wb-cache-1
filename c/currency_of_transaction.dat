50|$|The {{commercial}} {{aspect of}} the game is constantly changing, following an in-game market. Goods are transacted at extremely variable prices depending on their availability and the stability of the kingdom. All the goods in the Bicolline world are in the form of cards. These cards have a certain worth depending on the days market and are often traded among players in order to fortify their guild or to complete certain tasks. There is also the population cards that each member of Bicolline receives upon entry. These are seen {{as one of the most}} precious cards in the game as each guild must accumulate a certain amount of cards in order to stay in existence. Many players try to exchange and gather as many population cards as they can in order to help their guild, and are also some of the most expensive cards on the market. Bicolline also mints its own coins, called the Solar, that are another <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> <b>transaction.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{read-only}} transaction (ROT) {{does not}} modify any data. The main issues regarding processing ROTs are correctness, data currency and perform-ance. Two-phase Locking (2 PL) protocol {{is widely used}} for concurrency con-trol with serializabilty as correctness criteria. Even though 2 PL processes ROTs correctly with no data currency related issues, the performance deteriorates as data contention increases. To improve the performance over 2 PL, snapshot iso-lation (SI) -based protocols have been proposed. SI-based protocols process ROTs by reading from {{a snapshot of the}} committed data and ignoring the modi-fications produced by the concurrent active transactions. Even though SI-based algorithms improve the performance of ROTs, both data <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> ROTs and correctness (serializability) are compromised. In this paper, we propose an ap-proach to improve the performance of ROTs using speculation without compromising data <b>currency</b> <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> and correctness. The proposed approach improves the performance of ROTs by trading extra computing re-sources without violating serializability as correctness criteria. The simulation results show that with the proposed protocol the throughput performance is im-proved significantly over 2 PL and SI-based approaches with manageable extra resources...|$|R

25|$|A {{currency}} transaction tax {{is a tax}} {{placed on}} a specific type <b>of</b> <b>currency</b> <b>transaction</b> for a specific purpose.

To this end, additional control information is broadcast. A suite of methods is proposed that vary in the complexity and volume of the control information transmitted and subsequently differ in response times, degrees of concurrency, and space and processing overheads. The proposed methods are combined with caching to improve query latency. The relative advantages of each method are demonstrated through both simulation results and qualitative arguments.

40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper {{introduces}} a new P 2 P Electronic Cash system called Netcoin. The purpose of Netcoin is to facilitate inexpensive peer-to-peer monetary transactions on the Web. Its salient features {{are that it}} is a traceable system with an efficient mechanism for verifying transactions. Netcoins are reusable and can be easily passed from one user to another. The issuing <b>of</b> virtual <b>currency</b> and verification <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> are performed by trusted mints, which act as the gateway between the fiat and virtual currency worlds. There is no need to maintain a public ledger, which would inhibit use on a global scale because of rapidly increasing memory and bandwidth requirements. The system is neither inflationary nor deflationary in nature and does not purport a new economic model. As a fiat-backed currency it should not suffer the volatility issues associated with Bitcoin. In this paper the two most prominent electronic payment systems of the last forty years, namely Ecash and Bitcoin, are examined. Netcoin is then introduced in detail and is designed to address the shortcomings of these payment systems. Keywordsâ€”Bitcoin, Ecash, Block Chain, Proof-of-Work I...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the {{non-monetary}} effects of the euro accession of Poland.

We employ a dynamic general equilibrium model with perfect foresight multiple households, adjustment cost of capital, disaggregated labor market. We directly model trade-driven productivity spillovers. Our simulations show a long run GDP gain from the euro accession at the level of 7. 5 % of benchmark GDP of which 90 % is realized in first 10 years. The main factor behind growth is investment that leads to an extra 12. 6 percent of extra capital accumulated in the long run. The welfare gains amount to roughly 2 % of the value of GDP each year.

The second result is, the tax harms short-term speculation in favor or long-term investments, while it also harms trading rules based on economic fundamentals in favor to trend-extrapolating trading rules.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the Spanish Monarchy found out some {{problems}} in its monetary system. So far, almost all the studies have been concentrated in the billon problem and inflation. However, small and large silver coins had also problems to circulate together in Castile. Without small change, among other consequences, it was more difficult to carry out small transactions and without large denominations the credit borrowed by the king to foreign bankers was more expensive. These problems were endogenous to the Castilian monetary system based on precious metals. Those problems were aggravated with the inflation <b>of</b> copper <b>currency</b> and the new war scenario in Flanders during the seventeenth century. The Monarchy took decisions against the market in order to avoid those problems. These measures did not solve the problems, but they affected the fineness <b>of</b> the <b>currency,</b> the price <b>of</b> <b>transactions</b> and the relationship between the Council of Finance and its foreign bankers.
