40|$|In this study, a {{practical}} method to establish effluent limitations for priority water pollutants (PWPs) from industrial facilities was developed. As a case study, we collected influent and effluent wastewater samples from a terminal <b>disposal</b> <b>plant</b> for wastewater in Ulsan, Korea. Five water quality parameters and 17 PWPs were analyzed, and their discharge loads {{to the terminal}} <b>disposal</b> <b>plant</b> were calculated. In addition, the treatment efficiencies of PWPs were estimated by measuring concentrations and flow rates using the direct calculation method and the Monte Carlo simulation. If treatment efficiencies of PWPs are higher than 20 %, the effluent limitations for industrial facilities can be maintained or relaxed {{in comparison with the}} Ministry of Environment (MOE) limitations for terminal <b>disposal</b> <b>plants.</b> Furthermore, a range of effluent limitations for the industrial facilities with various operating conditions of the terminal <b>disposal</b> <b>plant</b> (0 - 100 %) were suggested. The method for establishing PWP limitations developed in this study can be applied to any terminal <b>disposal</b> <b>plants.</b> clos...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} few years, several episodes of {{atmospheric}} pollution {{have been reported in}} a limited area near Guidonia, Rome. The area contains a <b>disposal</b> <b>plant,</b> Inviolata, for the collection of municipal solid waste (MSW) and a famous thermal water resort, the Acque Albule spring, which is a source of water rich in H 2 S. We conducted a multiparametric study in the areas surrounding the solid waste <b>disposal</b> <b>plant</b> and the Acque Albule spring. The concentration of main gaseous effluent was continuously monitored over a period of 4 months and the data relating to the meteorologic conditions in the area during {{the last few}} decades were examined. Our results suggest that most of the atmospheric pollution is due to the interaction of different gaseous effluents. Specifically, the presence of relatively high levels of hydrogen sulfide in the atmosphere, constantly released in large amounts by the Acque Albule springs, and of biogases (mainly hydrocarbons) from the organic matter present in the solid waste continuously unloaded and stored at the <b>disposal</b> <b>plant,</b> lead to mixing and photochemical interactions between these chemical compounds, which in turn are responsible for most of the polluting effects. Such interactions are promoted by the strong solar irradiation in the area that is enhanced by the peculiar local meteorological features that do not allow the pollutants to disperse...|$|R
