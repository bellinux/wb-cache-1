The following measurements were taken during September and October for the parameters: - Survival percent for seedlings of seeds origin, seedlings and natural regeneration. - Coppicing power (number of coppice per stump). - Coppicing percent number of coppicing stumps out of the ten stumps for each age class. - Diameter at root collar for seedlings of seeds origin, seedlings and natural regeneration and at the <b>coppice</b> <b>shoot</b> bas for <b>coppice</b> using a small caliber. - Height for seedlings of seeds origin, seedlings, natural regeneration and <b>coppice</b> <b>shoot</b> using steal tape. The result indicated the superiority of seedlings giving 100 % survival 0. 54 cm diameter and 56. 5 cm height, while regeneration by seeds gave 4 % survival 0. 18 cm diameter and 15. 6 cm mean height. Also the result indicated that the best coppicing power (11 <b>coppice</b> <b>shoot</b> per stump) and best coppicing percent (80 - 90 %) was given by age class (5 - 10) (10 - 15 years), while coppicing power of (1 - 2) <b>coppice</b> <b>shoot</b> per stump and coppicing percent of (10 – 20 %) was given by age class (15 – 20 years) viii Acacia seyal variety seyal is recommended to be regenerated by seedlings in rain-fed areas on dark cracking clays in Gedarif state as the best methods of regeneration in small scale programs.

40|$|Chestnut (Castanea sativa L.) coppice stands {{currently}} cover about 195. 000 ha of Piedmont (North-Western Italy) surface, {{corresponding to}} 22. 4 % {{of the overall}} forested area in the region. Most of these forest stands are usually older than the typical rotation period. As a consequence from these stands timber assortments with a higher value could be obtained. The {{purpose of this study}} is to assess the amount of timber assortments and to propose a sorting methodology based on measurements on standing trees within these chestnut stands. Five study areas were selected in the Susa Valley, where forest measurements were realized within sampling plots.

The data elaboration allowed to assess the timber assortment production of the investigated stands. The proposed methodology makes it possible to better exploit timber assortments. In fact, while usually the whole production from chestnut coppices is directly destined to secondary products, the subdivision into assortments could result in a 20 % of products with higher commercial value. It is important to notice that within these stands no tending operation is currently realized.

40|$|Parkid higlohosa, an {{important}} indigenous fruit tree of West Affican Sudanian woodland, was studied {{with respect to}} natural population distribution and structure, regeneration, reproductive biology and phytosociology in Nigeria. As relevant background, a comprehensive range-wide monographic account of the species was assembled. An ecological survey covering the range of Parkia in Nigeria was undertaken between 1994 - 1995. The survey involved four ecological zones ranging from derived to Sudan/Sahel zone transition. In each ecological zone there were two sample sites within each of which there were two land use types. The survey showed that nearest mature con-specific neighbour distance and corresponding stocking for all individuals ý: 10 cm dbh ranged from 25. 5 m and 15 tree ha-I in the north down to 91. 5 m and I tree ha-I in the south. A gradual increase in stocking from the lowland forest zone boundary to the Sudan savanna was observed. Parkia populations are significantly more concentrated in cultivated fields than in less intensively used areas of the bush fallow. Natural regeneration in Parkia in Nigeria was sparse overall - 9. 80 individuals ha-I and <b>coppice</b> <b>shoot</b> regeneration was the main form. Bush fallow conditions favour more regeneration than intense cultivation, and to the south there is more regeneration than in the north. Tree morphological appraisal showed that there tended to be taller trees {{in the south of}} the Nigerian range (with a moister climate) but with smaller diameter than in the north. A broader crown diameter typified populations {{in the northern part of}} Nigeria range compared with the south. Branching height ranged from 1. 7 m in the north to 3. 9 m in the south. The tree rarely branched below Im anywhere. Two was the most frequent number of primary branches. Individuals with more than two primary branches per tree occur more frequently in the north of the range. For all morphological parameters except the number of primary branches a significant land use effect was detected. In the survey 136 associated woody species were recorded.

40|$|This study {{describes}} the above ground biomass production of 17 poplar (Populus spp.) clones after a 4 -year rotation in a short-rotation coppice culture. In addition, the link with soil characteristics was studied. In April 1996, an experimental field plantation with 10, 000 cuttings ha- 1 {{was established in}} Boom (province of Antwerp, Belgium) on a former waste disposal site. A randomised block design was used with three replicate plots (9 m x 11. 5 m). At {{the end of the}} establishment year, all plants were cut back to a height of 5 cm to create a coppice culture. At the end of the fourth year after <b>coppicing,</b> <b>shoot</b> diameters of all living and dead shoots were measured, and biomass production was estimated with an allometric power equation. A composite soil sample was taken for all plots, and pH, organic matter, water content, bulk density, content of nutrients, minerals and heavy metals were determined. Highest production was found for P. trichocarpa x P. deltoides hybrids Hazendans and Hoogvorst, P. trichocarpa clones Fritzi Pauley, Columbia River and Trichobel, and native P. nigra clone Wolterson with mean annual biomass production ranging between 8. 0 and 11. 4 Mg ha- 1 per year. Lowest performance was observed for P. trichocarpa x P. deltoides hybrid Boelare, P. deltoides x P. trichocarpa hybrids IBW 1, IBW 2 and IBW 3, and P. deltoides x P. nigra hybrids Gaver and Gibecq with a mean annual biomass production ranging between 2. 8 and 4. 7 Mg ha- 1. Mean dead biomass accounted for less than 2 % of total standing biomass for all clones. Some clones exhibited a uniform production across replicates, implying low susceptibility to soil heterogeneity; other clones showed a high inter-replicate variation. However, no cause for this interreplicate variation was identified. A cluster analysis enabled identification of two groups of plots with significant differences in soil characteristics and in biomass production. But a Spearman's rank correlation test showed only a negative correlation between biomass production and plant available magnesium and potassium in the soil. A principal component analysis and multiple regression could not reveal an unambiguous impact of soil either, caused by the low variance in soil characteristics, the high genotypic variation and/or the impact of non-identified (environmental) factors. © 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|PosterBioenergy was {{the second}} most {{important}} source of renewable energy - after wind-energy - in Germany to provide electricity during 2012. As the German government fixed an objective of 35 % of renewable resources in the final energy consumption by 2020, biomass production will continue to increase (Böhme and Musiol, 2013). Wood, as a source of renewable bioenergy can contribute to combined or separate heat and/or power production. It can be produced on farm land in short rotation coppices (SRC), mostly with poplars and willows. Such plantations have a high tree number and short harvest cycles (3 to 6 years), reaching a total of 6000 ha in Germany. Agroforestry systems combine tree and crop exploitation on one field, offering the possibility to simultaneously produce energy wood and food products. Many authors report of the benefits of such combination, especially of the increase in productivity of both, the annual and perennial plants compared to a conventional cropping system with only trees or annual crops (Dupraz and Liagre, 2011). Other positive effects of such a system can be the prevention of wind erosion, the introduction of valuable landscape structures and raising biodiversity (Nair, 1993). However, little information {{can be found on the}} productivity of short rotation coppice in alley cropping systems. In 2008, such a system has been established with poplars near Brunswick in Lower Saxony. The border rows among the six rows of the SRC-strips are showing a faster growth than the middle rows, profiting possibly from a higher light availability. They have bigger stem diameters and after <b>coppicing</b> more <b>shoots</b> resprouting from the stool. Leeward rows can produce even more biomass than the windward rows, while no increase in ash content could be observed. Thus, short rotation coppice in agroforestry can be more productive than extensive plantations of SRC, especially due to the higher proportion of side rows contributing to sustainable energy wood production...|$|R

Here are explained the results of clear cutting without the release of standards trials conducted in stands of E. occidentalis and E. x trabutii of the ionian area of Crotone (Calabria) {{at the end of}} the first four cultivation cycles: gamic (April 1974) and agamic (April 1984, 1993, 2001). The plantations, even if partially expressing their productive potentialities for the environment, objectively difficult where there have been plantings, have guaranteed, in the first three agamic cycles, a low mortality of the stumps, a discrete ability of regeneration, a good shooting faculty. The mortality in the E. x trabutii is higher than the one in the E. occidentalis, both in the gamic phase and in the group of the agamic cycles. The ability of agamic regeneration and the shooting faculty in the E. occidentalis are higher than in the E. x trabutii. As regards the bearing of the <b>coppice</b> <b>shoots,</b> the first class (vertical) stems are a prerogative of the E. x trabutii. The average diameter and height in the E. x trabutii <b>coppice</b> <b>shoots</b> are higher than in the E. occidentalis ones. The ipsodiametrical ratio of the <b>coppice</b> <b>shoots</b> is high both in the E. x trabutii and in the E. occidentalis, so the agamic stems, in comparison with seed plants, are at greater risk of weather damage. In the last two agamic cycles the regeneration of the radical <b>coppice</b> <b>shoots</b> with an invasive feature and short and worn out crowns, appeared in some areas of both species. The cormometrical volume per hectare produced by the two species in the agamic cycles is sensibly higher than the one found in the gamic phase and, in the last cycle, still slightly growing. In the coppices the eight-year-old wood stands vary from 42 - 49 m 3 ha- 1 for the E. occidentalis, to 59 - 83 m 3 ha- 1 for the E. x trabutii.

The treatments reduced AGB significantly in 1999 (partially cut: 37. 6 %, clear-cut: 94. 4 %) and after 10 years, AGB did not recover overall, nor did it recover in the clear-cut plots. Partially cut plots, however, recovered the lost AGB in 10 years via growth of uncut trees, which contributed significantly to biomass recovery, with only minor contributions from recruited trees and <b>coppice</b> <b>shoots.</b> For clear-cut plots, <b>coppice</b> <b>shoots</b> {{contributed significantly to the}} recovered AGB when compared with recruited biomass.

The magnitude of biomass reduction varied among the species assessed and this had a differential effect on their ability to recover AGB. We estimate that it will take approximately 45. 4 years for the clear-cut plots to recover pre-treatment AGB; this is significantly longer than AGB recovery time for some successional rainforests on abandoned pastures/farmland.

However, using basic equations for gas diffusion through stomata of different sizes, we show that a negative correlation between S and D offers several advantages, including plasticity in gwmax and gcmax with minimal change in epidermal area allocation to stomata. Examination of the relationship between S and D in Eucalyptus globulus seedlings and <b>coppice</b> <b>shoots</b> growing in the field under high and low rainfall revealed a strong negative relationship between S and D, whereby S decreased with increasing D according to a negative power function. The results provide evidence that plasticity in maximum stomatal conductance may be constrained by a negative S versus D relationship, with higher maximum stomatal conductance characterized by smaller S and higher D, and a tendency to minimize change in epidermal space allocation to stomata as S and D vary...|$|E
40|$|Techniques of clonal selection, {{establishment}} of hedged stool-beds, and cutting propagation {{have been developed}} for Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook. (Chinese fir) in Zhejiang Province, China, and clonal forestry has been implemented in a local programme based at Kaihua County Forest Farm. Cutting propagation and the maintenance of juvenility, and plantation performance of 102 clones in single-row plots and multi-tree blocks, have been studied over different years and sites. Hedged stool-beds with a density of 6. 3 stools/m 2 can provide 40 - 50 shoots per stool in the third year, when techniques for stimulating shoots have been used. Cuttings taken in the spring have an average rooting success of 90 %, height at age 1 year of 35 cm, and basal diameter of 6 mm at a density of 52. 5 plants/m 2, at which point they are ready for transplanting to field sites. Needle cuttings were developed to increase multiplication rates of superior clones. This involves cutting off needles (with a little xylem) from <b>coppice</b> <b>shoots</b> near the root collar, and setting during the period from January to March. Rooting was 85 %, the heigh...|$|E
30|$|The {{impacts of}} fires {{are not always}} {{negative}} as fires can also improve the growth of green grass which provides grazing for animals in the dry season, removal of old and normally less palatable dry plant material, the control and reduction of bush encroachment, the stimulation of germination of some useful species of grass, and trees and also the limitation of animal parasites (e.g., ticks), (WWF 2001; Nkomo & Sassi 2009). Surviving seeds may be stimulated to germinate after a fire (Sabiiti & Wein 1987), and many woody plants in savannas produce multiple <b>coppice</b> <b>shoots</b> to replace those lost or damaged through fire (Shackleton & Scholes 2000). However, the impact of fires on tropical forest biodiversity, especially in Zimbabwe has received little attention. There are still very few studies {{on the effects of}} fires on forest biodiversity in Zimbabwe. An exception is a study by Gandiwa & Kativu (2009), which investigated the effects of fire frequency on Colophospermum mopane and Combretum apiculatum woodland structure and composition in Gonarezhou National Park. The findings showed that low fire frequency was characterized by a significantly low density of woody plants (P< 0.001), and high mean basal area (P< 0.001), but fire frequency had no significant effect on species diversity (P> 0.05) (Gandiwa & Kativu 2009).|$|E
40|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the last century, chestnut played an important role as a staple food and primary wood source. However, with the abandonment of rural activities, the management of chestnut forests was progressively left behind. Following the suspension of the traditional coppice management system (rotation periods of 10 - 25 years), natural intra- and inter-specific competition dynamics have become the driving force in stand evolution. This may lead to dramatic chances in both structure and species composition of the stands. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the post-cultural evolution of an abandoned chestnut coppice in the Pesio Valley (Piedmont, Italy) in order to highlight the competitive fitness of the different “basic silvicultural elements” of the forest using a dendroecological approach. The “basic silvicultural components” are elements defined as groups of trees of the stand that have similar silviculturally relevant attributes: (species (chestnut, beech, fir), origin (seed, sprout), cultural age and function (standard/reserve, maiden, shoot, regeneration, dead tree). The mean growth curves of the components have shown the different fitness of each defined category. Beech and fir components show a better competitive potential in comparision with chestnut. Among the chestnut components, maiden originating from seeds reveal a better growth trend compared to <b>coppice</b> <b>shoots</b> and standards...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFallow with Psiadia altissima {{is one of}} {{the most}} common post-'slash and burn' {{vegetation}} successions described in the evergreen forests of eastern Madagascar. Some fallows consist of almost pure stands of this species, of which the leaves produce an essential oil offering international commercial interest. The present research aims to evaluate the production potential of essential oil derived from different fallows rich in P. altissima. The study has revealed that fallows aged 4 and 6 years since the last crop abandonment produce the most essential oil (around 20 l ha− 1), but relative to fallow duration, the youngest fallows (1 - or 2 -year-old) are the most productive, respectively producing 12 and 6 l ha− 1 year− 1. Additionally, the trees from the youngest fallows have a substantial capacity for regeneration from <b>coppice</b> <b>shoots,</b> on condition that the cut is performed well above the root collar. Although farmers earn five times less from harvesting leaves than from cultivating rice from tavy, the possibility is there for them to complement their income and diversify their production. The overall results show that sustainable exploitation of fallows of P. altissima is a conceivable option. However, this can only be achieved through an integrated approach that takes into account the environmental and social constraints associated with the development of this new activity...|$|E
