25|$|One-off engine test bed, {{converted}} from former No. 616 Squadron RAF operational F.1 serial number EE227, for the Rolls-Royce Trent turboprop engine {{making it the}} world's first turboprop-powered aircraft. The undercarriage was lengthened to give ground clearance for the initial 7 ft 7 inch Rotol airscrews. First flying in September 1945, it was not shown publicly until June 1946. It was found that separate controls for thrust and constant speed units required a lot of skill to manage. It was then flown with higher engine thrust and smaller propellers to enable development of a <b>combined</b> <b>control</b> system. The development programme was complete by 1948.|$|E
2500|$|Both Widerøe and Norving {{applied to}} operate the Finnmark route, which would connect the {{airports}} together and to the primary airports in Finnmark and Tromsø Airport. Norving planned to operate with their Britten-Norman Islanders and Britten-Norman Trislanders. The government opted to selected Widerøe and their Twin Otters, citing {{the need for a}} single operator for all subsidized regional routes in the country. Vadsø Airport opened on 1 August 1974 {{at the same time as}} Sørkjosen Airport, Hammerfest Airport, Mehamn Airport and Berlevåg Airport. The airport featured a <b>combined</b> <b>control</b> tower and terminal, which had a capacity for 30 people. Twin Otters landed at Vadsø four times daily. Norving started a service from Kirkenes via Vadsø to Båtsfjord Airport in January 1975. However, they did not have permission to fly passengers between Vadsø and Kirkenes. Widerøe introduced the de Havilland Canada Dash 7 in 1984, which required an upgrade to the airport. Specifically a new [...] terminal building was built along with a [...] hangar. For a short period the airport had a cafe. Widerøe took over Norving's Båtsfjord service in 1990.|$|E
