50|$|Amaranthus retroflexus is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the Amaranthaceae family with several common names, including red-root amaranth, redroot pigweed, red-rooted pigweed, <b>common</b> <b>amaranth,</b> pigweed amaranth, and common tumbleweed.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} four solarizing plastic {{materials}} on weed suppression and yield response of two lettuce cultivars (‘Bacio’ and ‘Moringa’) grown during two consecutive seasons was investigated at Metaponto (40 ° 23 ′N; 16 ° 47 ′E; 10 ma. s. l.), southern Italy. All solarization treatments suppressed winter and summer weeds with {{no significant difference}} among the plastic materials, although biodegradable film was less efficient in controlling common purslane and <b>common</b> <b>amaranth.</b> Weed infestation at the harvest of both lettuce cultivars was not affected by the solarizing material, whereas fewer weeds {{were found in the}} plots grown with ‘Bacio’ than with ‘Moringa’. Lettuce yield in two successive growing seasons was always significantly higher in solarized plots than in nontreated control, without any statistical difference among the plastic materials. Yield and head quality of cv. ‘Bacio’ were higher than ‘Moringa’ in the first growing season, but the opposite occurred in the second crop. Soil solarization was confirmed to be effective for weed management in field lettuce crops in the Mediterranean areas, although weed suppression may be affected also by the lettuce cultivar...|$|E
5000|$|Amaranthus deflexus is {{also known}} by the <b>common</b> names large-fruit <b>amaranth,</b> low amaranth, Argentina amaranth, and {{perennial}} pigweed, is native to Korea and South America. It is a short-lived perennial or annual plant. The plant can grow up to 1.5 ft (0.5 m) in height.|$|R
50|$|Amaranthus californicus is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the amaranth family known by the <b>common</b> name California <b>amaranth.</b> It is a glabrous monoecious annual that is native {{to most of the}} western United States and Canada. The plant grows from 10 to 50 centimeters tall. It is found in moist flats or near bodies of water, and blooms from summer to fall.|$|R
50|$|Species like <b>common</b> heather or <b>amaranths</b> {{are able}} to {{concentrate}} cesium-137, the most abundant radionuclide in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. In this region of Ukraine, mustard greens could remove up to 22% of average levels of cesium activity in a single growing season. In the same way, bok choy and mustard greens can concentrate 100 times more uranium than other species.|$|R
40|$|Sufficient {{fertility}} {{is important}} for crop yield but supplying a balanced amount of each nutrient with compost is challenging and nutrient imbalances can benefit weeds more than crops. This work's goal was to partition out effects of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) from composted poultry manure on growth of corn, lettuce, kale, and <b>common</b> weeds Powell <b>amaranth,</b> <b>common</b> lambsquarters, giant foxtail, and velvetleaf. Plants were grown {{in the field in}} soil amended with compost or organic single-nutrient N, P, and K amendments. P amendment as bone char did not mimic P supply from compost. Weeds responded more strongly than corn to compost. Velvetleaf response to compost appeared driven by N. Responses of other weeds and lettuce to compost were not due to N or K, and may have been driven by P or another nutrient. These results support fertility management based on soil testing and anticipated crop needs. 2018 - 08 - 2...|$|R
50|$|Amaranthus powellii is {{a species}} of {{amaranth}} known by the <b>common</b> names Powell's <b>amaranth</b> and green amaranth. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, but it is common {{throughout most of the}} rest of the temperate Americas as a naturalized species. It has also been introduced to other continents, including Australia and Europe. This is an erect annual herb growing to a maximum height near two meters. It has leaves up to 9 centimeters long, those on the upper part of the plant lance-shaped and lower on the stem diamond or roughly oval in shape. The inflorescence holds several long, narrow clusters of both male and female flowers interspersed with spiny green bracts. The fruit is a smooth dehiscent capsule about 3 millimeters long containing shiny reddish black seeds.|$|R
50|$|Amaranthus watsonii is {{a species}} of {{amaranth}} known by the <b>common</b> name Watson's <b>amaranth.</b> It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it grows in sandy places such as deserts and beaches, and disturbed areas. It {{is also known as}} a rare introduced species in parts of Europe. This is an erect annual herb producing a glandular hairy stem to a maximum height of about a meter. The leaves are generally oval-shaped and up to 8 centimeters long, with a petiole of up to 9 centimeters. The species is dioecious, with male and female individuals producing different types of flowers. The inflorescence is a long spike cluster of flowers interspersed with spiny green glandular bracts. The fruit is a smooth capsule about 2 millimeters long that snaps in half to reveal a small shiny reddish black seed.|$|R
40|$|Bacterial canker of kiwifruit is {{the most}} {{destructive}} disease of cultivated Actinidia spp. The causal agent is the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae. Several surveys {{have been carried out}} in kiwi orchards in Romagna (northern Italy) and proved that Psa may have a significant epiphytic life, mainly on flowers, pollen and leaves. On the fruits of affected orchards Psa was detectable until early August. In Romagna, kiwifruit is cultivated in areas where also other fruit crops are grown, often side by side. A two-year survey confirmed that Psa is present as a leaf epiphyte in neighbouring stone fruit orchards (apricot and plum), when an affected kiwi orchard is nearby. Several other spontaneous plants and weeds present in kiwifruit orchards have been checked for the epiphytic presence of Psa. Stinging nettle was constantly associated with the epiphytic presence of Psa, thus providing good conditions for bacterial growth and survival. Psa was also detected on, or isolated from other weeds, like <b>amaranth,</b> <b>common</b> mallow, purslane, dandelion and smartweed. The time range during which Psa was detected/isolated on other plants was the same as Psa could be traced on kiwi plants. These results suggest that Psa, like other pathogenic and non pathogenic pseudomonads, might spend a significant lapse of time on non-host plants. The role in the epidemiology of the bacterial canker of kiwifruit of such epiphytic population is not known. As a good practice for kiwifruit orchards, control of weeds, especially in case of Psa presence, is particularly advised...|$|R
