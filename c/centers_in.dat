5|$|Ethylene glycol {{poisoning}} is {{a relatively}} common occurrence worldwide. Human poisoning often occurs in isolated cases, but may also occur in epidemics. Many cases of poisoning {{are the result of}} using ethylene glycol as a cheap substitute for alcohol or intentional ingestions in suicide attempts. Less commonly it {{has been used as a}} means of homicide. Children or animals may be exposed by accidental ingestion; children and animals often consume large amounts due to ethylene glycol having a sweet taste. In the United States there were 5816 cases reported to poison <b>centers</b> <b>in</b> 2002. Additionally, ethylene glycol was the most common chemical responsible for deaths reported by US poison <b>centers</b> <b>in</b> 2003.

Most deaths from ethylene glycol are intentional suicides; deaths in children due to unintentional ingestion are extremely rare.|$|E
