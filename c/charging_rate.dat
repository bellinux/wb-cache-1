5|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles offer users {{the opportunity to}} sell electricity stored in their batteries back to the power grid, thereby helping utilities to operate more efficiently {{in the management of}} their demand peaks. A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system would take advantage of the fact that most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time. During such idle times the electricity stored in the batteries could be transferred from the PEV to the power lines and back to the grid. In the U.S this transfer back to the grid have an estimated value to the utilities of up to $4,000 per year per car. In a V2G system it would also be expected that battery electric (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would have the capability to communicate automatically with the power grid to sell demand response services by either delivering electricity into the grid or by throttling their <b>charging</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

In a best case scenario using a 240 V charger on a 90 A circuit breaker, Tesla documents a recharging rate of -of-range for each hour charging; a complete recharge from empty would require just under 4 hours. The slowest <b>charging</b> <b>rate</b> using a 120V outlet on a 15 A circuit breaker would add -of-range for each hour charging; a complete recharge from empty would require 48 hours.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{changes in}} the {{economic}} regulation of the for-hire trucking industry in Ontario (Truck Transportation Act, 1988) have provided a new opportunity to investigate the associated impacts of deregulation or regulatory reform. Two main areas of concern are the overall <b>charge</b> <b>rate</b> levels for trucking service and the <b>charge</b> <b>rate</b> levels for shipments involving small remote communities. To investigate these areas of concern, the makeup of shipment revenues {{before and after the}} initiation of regulatory reform is analyzed. Emphasis is placed on the variation in intraregional shipment <b>charge</b> <b>rates</b> with respect to commodity type as well as the size and remoteness of the communities involved. The results of the multivariate analysis indicate that the overall <b>charge</b> <b>rate</b> levels have not declined in the majority of industry sectors examined. With respect to <b>charge</b> <b>rate</b> levels for small communities, the basic question concerns the existence of cross-subsidization. This can occur when carriers, 'obliged' to serve remote communities under regulation, subsidize shipments to such areas from revenues earned in busier markets. The analysis of data in this paper provides evidence that cross-subsidization was present in some sectors of the industry but not in others. ...|$|R

2500|$|To {{provide a}} system {{able to make}} such an {{accurate}} measurement, and do so continually, Pollard developed a system that used the entire CRT display to provide a measurement showing only ranges a short distance {{on either side of}} a pre-selected range setting. The system worked by charging a capacitor at a known rate until it reached a threshold that triggered the time base. The time base was set to move across the screen in the time that represented less than a kilometre. A large potentiometer was used to control the <b>charging</b> <b>rate,</b> which provided a range offset.

40|$|Increased <b>charging</b> <b>rates</b> {{negatively}} affect {{the lifetime of}} lithium-ion cells by increasing cell resistance and reducing capacity. This work is a post-mortem study of 18650 -type cells subjected to <b>charge</b> <b>rates</b> of 0. 7 -, 2 -, 4 -, and 6 -C. For cells charged at 0. 7 -C to 4 -C, this performance degradation is primarily related to surface film thickness with no observable change in surface film chemical composition. However, at <b>charge</b> <b>rates</b> of 6 -C, the chemical composition of the surface film changes significantly, suggesting that this change {{is the reason for}} the sharper increase in cell resistance compared to the lower <b>charge</b> <b>rates.</b> In addition, we found that surface film formation was not uniform across the electrode. Surface film was thicker and chemically different along the central band of the electrode “jelly roll”. This result is most likely attributable to an increase in temperature that results from non-uniform electrode wetting during manufacture. This non-uniform change further resulted in active material delamination from the current collector owing to chemical changes to the binder for the cell charged at 6 -C...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{investigate}} distributed thermal-electrochemical modeling of a Lithium-Ion battery cell {{to include the}} effect of temperature distribution across {{the thickness of the}} cell as a first step to study the module level temperature distribution at high <b>charging</b> <b>rates.</b> Most recent works have focused on lumped thermal models for a Li-Ion cell which ignore any temperature differential across cell thickness. However, even a small temperature differential across cell thickness at the cell level can contribute to significant temperature differential in the thickness direction of stacked-up Li-Ion cells at the module level. Such temperature differential can potentially impact the battery charging control system, especially at high <b>charging</b> <b>rates.</b> Here, the thermal-electrochemical partial differential and algebraic equations for a Li-ion cell are solved via a spatial finite difference method. Simulation results show that the temperature differentials over the cell thickness at the cell level are not insignificant, particularly at high <b>charging</b> <b>rates.</b> 1...|$|R

With this method, a much higher <b>charging</b> <b>rate</b> can be used than with a trickle charge, up to 1 C. At this charge rate, Panasonic recommends to terminate charging when the voltage drops 5-10 mV per cell from the peak voltage.
