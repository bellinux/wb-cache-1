500|$|Dodd {{argues for}} a date between 96–110 A.D., {{concluding}} from the absence of references to persecution in the letters that they were probably written after the harsh reign of the Roman emperor Domitian, whose persecution of Christians seems to have prompted {{the writing of the}} Book of Revelation. [...] Dodd notes, however, that they could have been written in the pre-Domitian era, which is likely if the author was a personal disciple of Jesus. Marshall suggests a date of between the 60s and 90s. Rensberger suggests a dating of around 100, assuming that the Gospel of John was written in the 90s and the letters must have followed after. Brown argues {{for a date}} of between 100 and 110, with all three letters composed in <b>close</b> <b>time</b> proximity. A date past 110–115 is unlikely, as parts of 1 John and 2 John are quoted by Polycarp and Papias.|$|E
500|$|Jacob Araptany was the {{youngest}} competitor to represent Uganda in the athletics discipline at the London Olympics, aged 18. He had not participated in any previous Olympic Games. Araptany had intended {{to take part in}} the men's 1500 metres and the 3000 metres steeplechase, but after consultation with the Ugandan coach, he elected to participate in the latter event because of the <b>close</b> <b>time</b> frame between the two events. He qualified for the Games because his fastest time of eight minutes and 14.48 seconds, set at the 2011 Golden Gala, exceeded the required [...] "A" [...] standard entry time. He was drawn in the event's second heat on 3 August, finishing seventh out of twelve runners, with a time of eight minutes and 35.85 seconds. He finished ahead of France's Vincent Zouaoui-Dandrieaux (eight minutes and 36.96 seconds) and Kyle Alcorn of the United States (eight minutes and 37.11 seconds) in a heat led by Brimin Kipruto of Kenya (eight minutes and 28.62 seconds). Araptany finished 25th out of 37 competitors overall, and did not progress into the final because his time was 6.73 slower than the slowest runner in his heat who made the later stages.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Closed</b> <b>time</b> is {{possible}} in several senses of ‘possible’. One might like to know, therefore, whether <b>closed</b> <b>time</b> {{is possible}} {{in the sense that}} it is compatible with standard metaphysical theories of time. In this paper I am concerned with whether <b>closed</b> <b>time</b> is compatible with A and/or B theories of time. A common enough view amongst philosophers is that B theories do but A theories do not allow <b>closed</b> <b>time.</b> However, I show that prima-facie neither approach allows <b>closed</b> <b>time,</b> but that with a little work standard versions of both approaches do. This shows that there’s no special problem with the notion of eternal return...|$|R

60|$|These latter had {{now become}} an {{important}} and remarkably noisy element in the colony. They and time together did much to efface the saddening effects of the gloomy epoch which had just come to a <b>close.</b> <b>Time,</b> however, did more than merely relieve {{the feelings of the}} surviving mutineers and widows.

There also came a Jane Quintal and an Arthur Quintal, who were closely followed by a Rebecca Adams and a James Young. So that the self-imposed cares and burdens of that pretty, active, and self-denying little creature, Otaheitan Sally, increased with her years and stature.|$|E
60|$|When Fergus and Waverley met, {{the latter}} was struck with the {{peculiar}} grace and dignity of the Chieftain's figure. Above the middle size and finely proportioned, the Highland dress, which he wore in its simplest mode, set off his person to great advantage. He wore the trews, or close trowsers, made of tartan, chequed scarlet and white; in other particulars his dress strictly resembled Evan's, excepting {{that he had no}} weapon save a dirk, very richly mounted with silver. His page, as we have said, carried his claymore; and the fowling-piece, which he held in his hand, seemed only designed for sport. He had shot {{in the course of his}} walk some young wild-ducks, as, though <b>CLOSE</b> <b>TIME</b> was then unknown, the broods of grouse were yet too young for the sportsman. His countenance was decidedly Scottish, with all the peculiarities of the northern physiognomy, but yet had so little of its harshness and exaggeration that it would have been pronounced in any country extremely handsome. The martial air of the bonnet, with a single eagle's feather as a distinction, added much to the manly appearance of his head, which was besides ornamented with a far more natural and graceful cluster of close black curls than ever were exposed to sale in Bond Street.|$|E
6000|$|What {{concerned}} us most, however, was {{the discovery}} of oysters, which, adhering to the reefs projected under water from the rocky northern cliff, formed a live conglomerate; and from the present time forwards we found the succulent molluscs in almost every bay. Those to the south, where the shallows overlie sand and mud, are not so good. At this season the Ustrída is flat, fleshy, and full sized; the shell has a purple border, and the hinge muscle of the savage, far stronger {{than that of the}} civilized animal, together with its exceeding irregularity of shape, giving no purchase to the knife, makes oyster-opening a sore trouble. We tried fire, but the thick-skinned things resisted it for a long time; and, when they did gape, the liquor had disappeared, thereby spoiling the flavour. The [...] "beard" [...] was neither black, like that of the Irish, nor colourless, as in the English oyster. The Bedawin, who ignore the delicacy, could not answer any questions about the [...] "spatting season"--probably it is earlier than ours, which extends through June; whether also a <b>close</b> <b>time</b> is required, as in England to August 4th, we could not guess. The young probably find a natural [...] "culch" [...] in the many shells, cockle and others, that strew the rock, sand, and clay.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To use hourly {{building}} occupancy data {{over the}} period of 2012 - 2014 {{to determine the effect}} of changes to library hours of operation on building occupancy near and in the hours leading up to <b>closing</b> <b>time.</b> Methods: Data were collected using an automated gate count system at the primary entrance to the library. The system tracked the occupancy of the building by comparing the number of entrances and exits hourly each day. Incremental changes to the library’s hours of operation occurred in the same time period for the years 2012 - 2014. This time period will be compared year-to-year. We will test whether changes in <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> {{have a significant effect on}} mean occupancy rates during each of the three hours leading up to closing. Based on a previous study which examined a smaller, six-week period between 2012 - 2014, we expect to find that as <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> is extended, building occupancy in the hours preceding <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> increases despite a decrease in occupancy at closing. Results: Mean occupancy during the hour before <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> did not change when <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> was extended from 9 PM to 10 PM. When <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> was extended to 12 AM, mean occupancy during the hour before closing decreased. Mean occupancy during the hour ending at 9 PM increased when <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> was extended from 9 PM to 10 PM. Mean occupancy during the hour ending at 10 PM increased when <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> was extended from 10 PM to 12 AM. We plan to also include data from the ongoing Spring semester in the final results. Conclusions: Occupancy near closing decreased as <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> became later. While occupancy near closing decreased somewhat, occupancy earlier in the evening increased as library hours were extended. The benefits of increased library occupancy appear to justify sustaining extended operating hours...|$|R

Blanche Boveal retired early, leaving the room in a series of laboured leaps that she hoped might be recognised as a tolerable imitation of Pavlova. Vera Durmot, the sixteen-year-old flapper, expressed her confident opinion that the performance was intended to typify Mark Twain’s famous jumping frog, and her diagnosis of the case found general acceptance. Another guest to set an example of early bed-going was Waldo Plubley, who conducted his life on a minutely regulated system of time-tables and hygienic routine. Waldo was a plump, indolent young man of seven-and-twenty, whose mother had early in his life decided for him that he was unusually delicate, and by dint of much coddling and home-keeping had succeeded in making him physically soft and mentally peevish. Nine hours’ unbroken sleep, preceded by elaborate breathing exercises and other hygienic ritual, was among the indispensable regulations which Waldo imposed on himself, and there were innumerable small observances which he exacted from those who were in any way obliged to minister to his requirements; a special teapot for the decoction of his early tea was always solemnly handed over to the bedroom staff of any house in which he happened to be staying. No one had ever quite mastered the mechanism of this precious vessel, but Bertie van Tahn was responsible for the legend that its spout had to be kept facing north during the process of infusion.|$|E
60|$|Charteris and Welch were conversing in {{the study}} of which they were the joint proprietors. That is to say, Charteris was talking and playing the banjo alternately, while Welch was deep in a book and refused to be drawn out of it under any pretext. Charteris' banjo was the joy of his fellows and the bane of his House-master. Being of a musical turn and owning a good deal of pocket-money, he had, {{at the end of the}} summer holidays, {{introduced}} the delights of a phonograph into the House. This being vetoed by the House-master, he had returned at the beginning of the following term with a penny whistle, which had suffered a similar fate. Upon this he had invested in a banjo, and the dazed Merevale, feeling that matters were getting beyond his grip, had effected a compromise with him. Having ascertained that there was no specific rule at St Austin's against the use of musical instruments, he had informed Charteris that if he saw fit to play the banjo before prep, only, and regarded the hours between seven and eleven as a <b>close</b> <b>time,</b> all should be forgiven, and he might play, if so disposed, till the crack of doom. To this reasonable request Charteris had promptly acceded, and peace had been restored. Charteris and Welch were a curious pair. Welch spoke very little. Charteris was seldom silent. They were both in the Sixth--Welch high up, Charteris rather low down. In games, Welch was one of those fortunate individuals who are good at everything. He was captain of cricket, and not only captain, but also the best all-round man in the team, which is often a very different matter. He was the best wing three-quarter the School possessed; played fives and racquets like a professor, and only the day before had shared Tony's glory by winning the silver medal for fencing in the Aldershot competition.|$|E

This nonlinearity of valves {{may lead to}} the inaccuracy of the opening and <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> constants calculated based on the whole segment fully open and fully close experimental test curves of the valve. An improved mathematical model of the turbine governor actuator is proposed to reflect the nonlinearity of the valve, in which the main and auxiliary piecewise opening and <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> constants instead of the fixed oil motive opening and <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> constants are adopted to describe the characteristics of the actuator. The main opening and <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> constants are obtained from the linear segments of the whole fully open and close curves. The parameters of proportional integral derivative (PID) controller are identified based on the small disturbance experimental tests of the valve. Then the auxiliary opening and <b>closing</b> <b>time</b> constants and the piecewise opening and closing valve points are determined by the fully open/close experimental tests. Several testing functions are selected to compare genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm (GA-PSO) with other basic intelligence algorithms. The effectiveness of the piecewise linear model and its parameters are validated by practical power plant case studies...|$|R
