500|$|Alfa-Romeo’s sportscar-derived flat-12 engine had a {{capacity}} of 2995cc and employed fuel injection and electronic ignition. The engine featured a <b>cast</b> <b>magnesium</b> alloy engine block with aluminium alloy crankcase and magnesium or aluminium cylinder heads. There were four gear-driven valves per cylinder. In Formula One form by 1978 it delivered about 520bhp at 12,000rpm, about 50bhp more than the Cosworth DFV engines used by most teams, {{as well as a}} peak 324lb-ft of torque (439 N·m). [...] However the power came at the expense of greater size, increased fuel and oil consumption and about 40kg more weight. The engine was also difficult to work with, with significant variations in dimensions between units.|$|E
500|$|Against {{the trend}} {{set by the}} Lotus 21 in 1961, the BT19's suspension, which {{controls}} the relative motion of the chassis and the wheels, is outboard all round. That is, the bulky springs and dampers are mounted {{in the space between}} the wheels and the bodywork, where they interfere with the airflow and increase unwanted aerodynamic drag. Tauranac persisted with this apparently conservative approach based on wind tunnel tests he had carried out in the early 1960s, which indicated that a more complicated inboard design, with the springs and dampers concealed under the bodywork, would provide only a 2% improvement in drag. He judged the extra time needed to set up an inboard design at the racetrack to outweigh this small improvement. At the front the suspension consists of unequal length, non-parallel double wishbones. The front uprights, the solid components upon which the wheels and brakes are mounted, were modified from the Alford & Alder units used on the British Triumph Herald saloon. The rear suspension is formed by a single top link, a reversed lower wishbone and two radius rods locating <b>cast</b> <b>magnesium</b> alloy uprights. Wheels were initially 13inches (330mm) in diameter, but soon upgraded to [...] at the rear, and later still 15in at the front as well. These increases enabled the use of larger, more powerful brakes. Steel disc brakes are used on all four wheels and were of [...] diameter for the smaller wheels and [...] for the larger ones. The car ran on treaded Goodyear tyres throughout its racing career.|$|E

Findings: The outcarried researches pointed out very high potential and attractiveness of the given technologies in the background environment and the promising improvement of mechanical properties of examined materials. Research limitations/implications: Described materials science and foresight research concerning the cladding and remelting of carbides and oxides in the surface of <b>casting</b> <b>magnesium</b> alloys are a part of a wider research project aiming to define, examine and characterise innovative technology of surface engineering of engineering materials.

The JIM operator received air through an oral/nasal mask that attached to a lung-powered scrubber that had a life-support duration of approximately 72 hours, although actual survival for this time would have been unlikely due to thermal transfer through the magnesium body.|$|E

The stainless steel exhaust manifolds and computer control system introduced on the [...] California engines the previous year were now standard, as was an auxiliary electric engine cooling fan. This, the last C3 available with a manual transmission, so equipped, had a published 0-60mph in 8.1seconds. This model year was the first corvette to use a fiberglass rear leaf spring, now a Corvette trademark. The spring saved thirty-six pounds, but was limited to base suspensions with automatic transmission. When equipped with Delco's brand new optional ETR (Electronically Tuned Receiver) radio with a digital clock, the quartz analog instrument panel clock was replaced with an oil temperature gauge. The cast aluminum wheels, optional since ’76, were now ordered on 90 percent of the cars at a cost of $428. New options included a power adjustable driver’s seat and power remote outside mirrors.

[...] The engine is controlled by two Bosch DI-Motronic MED9.1 electronic engine control units (working as 'master' and 'slave', because of the high-revving nature of the engine), and uses Bosch 'E-Gas' electronic throttle control (also known as drive by wire), comprising throttle device, accelerator-pedal module, and ECU. [...] The ignition system uses eight individual single-spark coils, using mapped direct ignition, with Bosch single iridium electrode or NGK triple-electrode long-life spark plugs. Ignition timing is monitored with the aid of four knock sensors. The engine complies with the Euro4 European emission standards.

40|$|Abstract: Conventional {{production}} process of magnesium alloy strips involves many steps, including multi-hot rolling and multi-heat treatment, which is time-consuming and needs high energy cost. By use of thin strip <b>casting,</b> <b>magnesium</b> alloy <b>cast</b> strip with a thickness {{of less than}} 8 mm can be produced and then rolled to the strip of the needed thickness, which is a short, energy saving and high effective process.
