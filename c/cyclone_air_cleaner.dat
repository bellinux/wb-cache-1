This paper focuses on experiments to measure the removal of decane with two different gaseous <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> in a test house. Due to the lack of gaseous <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> field testing protocols, a field test method was developed using semi-real-time measurements and mass balance analysis. To date, 24 experiments have been completed with single-pass removal efficiencies ranging from 30 % to 44 %. A full factorial analysis revealed that factors such as <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> location, status of the heating and air conditioning system, relative humidity and temperature significantly affect <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> performance.

40|$|Dust {{pollution}} {{is a serious}} indoor health problem in domestic premises. Many households are using portable home <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> to remove indoor air pollutants. Ionizer type <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> {{are the most popular}} in the market and dust is one of the common airborne pollutants in indoors. The performance of dust removal efficiency of ionizer type <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> is an important domestic indoor air quality (IAQ) issue. There are various kinds of household dust produced. They have different impacts on occupants' health. This study focuses on the effect of different dust aerodynamic diameters (PM 10 and PM 2. 5) and critically reviews the methods and parameters influencing the performance of an ionizer type domestic <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> for removing dust. The performance test was conducted in an airtight test chamber. The study was performed to develop a mathematical model to assess effectiveness of <b>air</b> <b>cleaners.</b> Experimental results were analyzed to determine whether the use of the <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> could significantly reduce dust pollution and the CADR of each <b>air</b> <b>cleaner.</b> Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{with the}} {{increased}} concern of Indoor Air Quality, portable <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> is commonly utilized to treat air in indoor environments. Testing standards for <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> in evaluating their performances are also in response to their rapid development. However, {{all of them are}} chamber test where the air change rate, deposition rate inside are under controlled and minimized. There is a great discrepancy compared with the practical use in real scenario so {{that it is necessary to}} determine the difference of the removal performance obtained under the conditions in control room and in residences. In this study, five <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> with different operation principles were tested in both control test and field tests. There were no combustion related activities inside the six residences visited in the field tests and atmospheric dust was used as the test dust. The revised Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) of each <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> was evaluated by performing a simplified indoor particulate analysis. The performance of the electronic <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> was more dependent on the surface area of the testing venue and higher CADR was obtained in residences than in the control room which could be as large as 6. 9 times in maximum for small particles. The removal efficiency of the <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> was also dependent on their flow characteristics and the degree of mixing of air delivered from the <b>air</b> <b>cleaner.</b> A 10 - 20 % reduction on average was found for the CADRs obtained in the six residences compared with the results measured in the control test. In the perspective of the running cost, the initial cost of purchasing the <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> contributed 76 % on average reflected in the cost analysis and this would be the decisive factor compared with the operation and the maintenance costs. The selection of <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> by <b>air</b> cleaning effectiveness (fCADR) is suggested in this study.

40|$|The {{formaldehyde}} (HCHO) in {{indoor air}} is mainly emitted from interior decoration materials, adhesives and paints. Due to the excessive interior decoration {{and the lack}} of appropriate regulation and control strategy, sometimes the cancer risk caused by formaldehyde is 100 to 1, 000 times greater than the acceptable level in many office buildings. This research studied the removal efficiency and the removal mechanism of indoor formaldehyde by various types of <b>air</b> <b>cleaners.</b> Four types of <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> were studied, including photo-catalytic, activated carbon, negative ion, and ozone <b>air</b> <b>cleaners,</b> at various relative humidity, temperatures, and formaldehyde concentrations. Batch experiments were conducted in an air-tight test chamber revised from standard method AHAM AC- 1. The formaldehyde removal efficiencies were determined from three experiments: (1) the natural decay of formaldehyde, (2) formaldehyde with cleaner turn-off, and (3) formaldehyde with cleaner turn-on. Formaldehyde concentrations were sampled and recorded every 10 to 30 minutes to study the removal efficiency. The results indicated that formaldehyde removal efficiency was affected by formaldehyde concentration, temperature, and relative humidity. Low removal efficiencies of formaldehyde were observed by the activated-carbon <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> (3. 3 ~ 28. 6 %) and the negative-ion <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> (18. 5 ~ 30. 8 %). The removal efficiencies of formaldehyde by photo-catalytic <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> were ranged 18. 7 ~ 56. 0 %.

Most polarized-media electronic <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> convert 24-volt current to safe DC voltage to establish the polarized electric field. Airborne particles become polarized as they pass through the electric field and adhere to a disposable fiber media pad. Ultra-fine particles (UFPs) that are not collected on their initial pass through the media pad are polarized and agglomerate to other particles, odor and VOC molecules and are collected on subsequent passes. The efficiency of polarized-media electronic <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> increases as they load, providing high-efficiency filtration, with air resistance typically equal to or less than passive filters. Polarized-media technology is non-ionizing, which means no ozone is produced.|$|R

We evaluated the effectiveness of an <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> in reducing droplet and aerosol contamination by positioning the device in four different locations in an actual dental clinic. We applied computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods to solve the governing equations of airflow, energy and dispersion of different-sized airborne droplets/aerosol particles. In a dental clinic, we measured the supply air velocity and temperature of the ventilation system, the airflow rate and the particle removal efficiency of the <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> to determine the boundary conditions for the CFD simulations. Our results indicate that use of an <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> in a dental clinic may be an effective method for reducing DHCWs' exposure to airborne droplets and aerosol particles. Further, we found that the probability of droplet/aerosol particle removal and the direction of airflow from the cleaner are both important control measures for droplet and aerosol contamination in a dental clinic. Thus, the distance between the <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> and droplet/aerosol particle source as well as the relative location of the <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> to both the source and the DHCW are important considerations for reducing DHCWs' exposure to droplets/aerosol particles emitted from the patient's mouth during treatments...|$|R

The effect of using <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> on indoor PM 2. 5 was investi-gated, as well as the effect of keeping windows closed. Appropriately sized <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> were provided to one of each pair of residences; occupants of all of the residences were asked to keep windows shut and minimize opening of exterior doors. Additionally, residents were asked to record all of the activities that may be a source of partic-ulate matter, such as cooking and cleaning.
