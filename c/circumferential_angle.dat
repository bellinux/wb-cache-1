40|$|For partial {{discharge}} (PD) diagnostics in gas insulated switchgears (GISs) {{based on the}} ultra-high-frequency (UHF) method, {{it is essential to}} study the attenuation characteristics of UHF signals so as to improve the application of the UHF technique. Currently, the performance of UHF has not been adequately considered in most experimental research, while the constructive conclusions about the installation and position of UHF sensors are relatively rare. In this research, by using a previously-designed broadband sensor, the output signal is detected and analyzed experimentally in a 252 kV GIS with L-shaped structure and disconnecting switch. Since the relative position of the sensor and the defect is usually fixed by prior research, three <b>circumferential</b> <b>angle</b> positions of the defect in cross section are performed. The results are studied by time, statistics and frequency analyses. This identifies that the discontinuity conductor of DS will lead to a rise of both the peak to peak value (Vpp) and the transmission rate of the UHF signal. Then, the frequency analysis indicates that the reason for the distinction of signal amplitude and transmission rate is that the mode components of the PD signal are distinctively affected by the special structure of GIS. Finally, the optimal <b>circumferential</b> <b>angle</b> position of the UHF Sensor is given based on the comparison of transmission rates...|$|E

40|$|Sonic boom {{attenuation}} is {{a considerable}} design challenge to enable civilian aircraft to operate at supersonic flight conditions. One technology proposed by Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation {{for the production of}} low-noise supersonic aircraft is the high-flow nacelle bypass concept in which an outer nacelle surface is used to encircle the asymmetric external engine protuberances of a traditional turbine engine. Although this bypass flow may reduce the overall sonic boom signature of the vehicle, the engine gearbox and protuberances create a highly complex 3 -D flow in the annular bypass region. To better understand the 3 -D flow features, an approximately 1 / 6 th engine model was tested in a newly constructed 11. 1 inch diameter axisymmetric test section of a subsonic wind tunnel at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. By rotating the test section, pressure measurements were obtained over a range of <b>circumferential</b> <b>angles</b> and radial positions.

Wind tunnel testing was performed on the empty axisymmetric wind tunnel followed by model configurations of increasing complexity until a full test configuration of the engine model with the gearbox fairing and crane beam mounts was achieved. Results show significant pressure loss behind the gearbox fairing further characterized using surface flow visualization.

In the analysis, the cylinder is divided into a number of layers while for each layer the material can be isotropic or orthotropic. A Rayleigh-Ritz type formulation is used, a displacement field being assumed in the form Σ Σ φ(θ) ψ(z) Ξ(x), in which φ(θ) is a trigonometric function of the <b>circumferential</b> <b>angle,</b> ψ(z) is a polynomial in the radial direction and the functions Ξ(x) are eigenfunctions which satisfy various boundary conditions.

We investigated {{the distribution of}} carotid atherosclerosis as determined by maximum carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), to assess if we could confirm this atherosclerotic configuration across various populations with different cardiovascular risk. Methods and results: We used the individual baseline CIMT data from 3364 subjects from four recent international multicentre randomized controlled trials in which the carotid artery was systematically examined using the same ultrasound protocol and method to quantify CIMT. For each subject, circumferential information on the maximum CIMT of {{the left and right}} carotid arteries was obtained for the common carotid, bifurcation, and internal carotid artery segments. In each segment (common, bifurcation, internal), mixed modelling was used to study the differences in CIMT between angles, sides, gender, age, race, and studies. Each segment showed a different circumferential CIMT pattern. In all segments there were statistically significant differences between maximum CIMT across <b>circumferential</b> <b>angles</b> (p < 0. 001); on average CIMT was highest in the posteromedial wall of the bifurcation and internal carotid segments and in the anterolateral wall of the common carotid segment. This asymmetric circumferential pattern was found to be identical in men and women, in young and old age, in different race groups, and across the studies. Conclusions: We confirmed the asymmetrical helix-like distribution of atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries and expand the evidence by showing that the atherosclerotic configuration is similar across populations with different vascular risks and across gender, age, and race. This has implications for future design of carotid ultrasound studies, as the angle of insonation is an important predictor of maximum CIM...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} computational {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) predictions of flow and heat transfer for an over-swirled low-radius preswirl system and comparison with experimental data. The rotor-stator CFD model comprises a stationary domain with the preswirl nozzles and a rotating domain with the receiver holes. The fluid-dynamic conditions feature an over-swirled system with a swirl ratio at the nozzle radius β p 1. 4 - 1. 5 and rotational Reynolds number Re Φ 0. 8 × 10 6 and 1. 2 10 6. Three different treatments for the rotating and stationary domain interface are {{used to evaluate the}} influence on the flow and heat transfer behavior: a stationary approach (including Coriolis forces in the rotating domain) with direct connection and fixed angle between preswirl nozzle and receiver holes; a stationary approach with circumferential averaging of the velocity at radial bands; and a full transient simulation with the rotating domain capturing the unsteady flow due to the rotating receiver holes. Results at different <b>circumferential</b> <b>angles</b> show high variability in pressure and velocity distributions at the preswirl inlet nozzle radius. Circumferential averaging of these flow parameters lead to an alignment of the pressures and velocities between the three different interface approaches. Comparison with experimental pressure and swirl-ratio data show a quantitative agreement but the CFD results feature a systematic overestimation outward of the preswirl nozzle radius. Heat transfer coefficient distributions at the rotor surface show the effect of the different interface approaches and dependence on the flow structure (for example the impinging jet and vortex structures). The three different interface approaches result in significant differences in the computed heat transfer coefficients between pairs of receiver holes. Circumferentially averaged heat transfer coefficients inward of the receiver holes radius show good agreement between the transient and stationary direct connection interfaces, whereas those for the circumferential averaging interface differ, contrary to the flow parameters, due to smoothing of local effects from the preswirl jets...|$|R

In this numerical study the influence of the <b>circumferential</b> <b>angle</b> spans of non-uniform heat flux distributions are considered on the secondary buoyancy-driven flow, internal fluid heat transfer coefficients, and friction factors in horizontal absorber tubes in parabolic trough solar collector applications for water heating in the laminar flow regime. Inlet Reynolds numbers ranging from 130 to 2200 for 10 m long tubes with different inner diameters were considered. Sinusoidal type incident heat flux distributions, tube-wall heat conduction and heat losses were taken into account. It was found that due to buoyancy-driven secondary flow, overall and local internal heat transfer coefficients were increased significantly due to the non-uniformity of the incident heat flux. Average internal heat transfer coefficient increased with the heat flux intensity, the incident heat flux angle span and the inlet fluid temperature. The effective friction factor decreased with an increase in the absorber tube inlet fluid temperature. It was found that improved thermal efficiencies can be achieved for low mass flow rate water heating applications by employing parabolic trough collector systems compared to flat plate systems.

40|$|Summary: The {{measurement}} of vibroacoustical energy flow through straight pipes has been investigated. At frequencies below the cut-on of n= 3 shell waves the energy propagates {{in a limited}} number of waves. The stnicture-borne energy in these waves can be determined from acceleration measurements on the pipe surface, provided that appropriate accelerometer configurations are chosen to separate the different waves. The energy flow in each wave can then be determined using a two-channel cross-spectral density method. It appears to be impossible to determine the fluid-borne energy flow from acceleration measurements, due to the transverse axis sensitivity of the accelerometers. Experiments on a cooling water pipe of a shipboard diesel engine indicate that energy flow measurements are feasible, although further investigations are necessary to achieve a practicable and reliable method.

As compared with findings in the control subjects, thallium washout in the anterior view (41. 9 versus 48. 6 %, p = 0. 02) and left anterior oblique projection (40. 5 versus 48. 2 %, p = 0. 007) was significantly diminished. Although the postoperative coarctation group had a lower thallium redistribution rate in the lateral view (41. 4 versus 46. 3 %, p = 0. 09) this difference did not reach statistical significance because of the intrinsic variability of this projection. Plots of the median percent thallium washout revealed independence from <b>circumferential</b> profile <b>angle,</b> indicating global abnormalities in perfusion. No correlation between clinical variables and thallium kinetics could be established, suggesting marked individual variability in the development of this vascular lesion. The observation of abnormal thallium kinetics in patients with coarctation repair may have consequences for long-term follow-up and therapy...|$|R
40|$|An oxidizer-swirled coaxial element {{injector}} {{is being}} investigated for application in the Space Transportation Main Engine (STME). Single element cold flow experiments were conducted to provide characterization of the STME injector element for future analysis, design, and optimization. All tests were conducted to quiescent, ambient backpressure conditions. Spray <b>angle,</b> <b>circumferential</b> spray uniformity, dropsize, and dropsize distribution were measured in water-only and water/nitrogen flows. Rupe mixing efficiency was measured using water/sucrose solution flows with a large grid patternator for simple comparative evaluation of mixing. Factorial designs of experiment were used for statistical evaluation of injector geometrical design features and propellant flow conditions on mixing and atomization. Increasing the free swirl angle of the liquid oxidizer had the greatest influence on increasing the mixing efficiency. The addition of gas assistance had the most significant effect on reducing oxidizer droplet size parameters and increasing droplet size distribution. Increasing the oxidizer injection velocity had the greatest influence for reducing oxidizer droplet size parameters and increasing size distribution for non-gas assisted flows. Single element and multi-element subscale hot fire testing are recommended to verify optimized designs before committing to the STME design...|$|R
40|$|The useful {{operating}} {{range of the}} multistage, axial-flow compressor component of a gas turbine engine limits the extent of operation of that engine. Generally, the compressor stalls or surges at low flow rates and chokes at high flow rates. Thus, any improvement in the range between these compressor aerodynamic limits is normally of benefit to the engine also. An idea for delaying the onset of rotating stall in a multistage, axial-flow compressor which involved circumferentially varying the blade setting angles of stationary blades upstream of the compressor rotors was investigated. Tests involving two low-speed, multistage, axial-flow compressors and an intermediate-speed, three-stage, axial-flow compressor were completed. Comparisons between baseline compressor (circumferentially uniform setting angles) and modified compressor (circumferentially varying setting angles) performance data were made. A variety of blade setting <b>angle</b> <b>circumferential</b> variation patterns were tested. Test results suggest that rotating stall onset in the low-speed compressors could be delayed slightly but consistently with circumferentially varying setting angles. The low-speed compressor results indicated that a small improvement in stall recovery was also possible. The intermediate-speed compressor data {{indicated that there was}} a slight stall margin improvement at low compressor rotational speeds only. At higher rotational speeds no improvement was noticed...|$|R
