5|$|Imagining the {{creation}} of an artistic community at Upton, Morris helped develop plans for a second house to be constructed adjacent to Red House in which Burne-Jones <b>could</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> his family; the plans were abandoned when Burne-Jones' son Philip died from scarlet fever. By 1864, Morris had become increasingly tired of life at Red House, being particularly unhappy with the 3 to 4 hours spent commuting to his London workplace on a daily basis. He sold Red House, and in autumn 1865 moved with his family to No. 26 Queen Square in Bloomsbury, the same building to which the Firm had moved its base of operations earlier in the summer.|$|E

At {{the time of}} their foundation the goal of the nationalist movements, such as the Patani United Liberation Organisation (PULO) established in 1968, was secession. The emphasis was laid in pursuing an armed struggle towards an independent state where Patani people <b>could</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> dignity without having alien cultural values imposed on them.|$|E
25|$|The {{same year}} (1931), Muriel {{told us that}} Mahatma Gandhi (at whose ashram she had stayed in India) was coming over for the Round Table Conference.

25|$|Many elite Protestants {{were now}} {{alarmed by the}} forces unleashed, {{and some of the}} nobility began to shift towards support of the government. Implementing the {{somewhat}} vague terms of the agreement led to further tensions, and William of Orange, appointed by Margaret to resolve the situation in Antwerp, tried and failed to produce a wider settlement that all parties <b>could</b> <b>live</b> <b>with.</b> Instead unrest continued and the episode fed into the causes of the Dutch Revolt which was to erupt two years later.|$|E
25|$|Attorney General Janet Reno {{ordered the}} return of Elián González to his father and set a {{deadline}} of April 13, 2000, but the Miami relatives defied the order. Negotiations continued for several days as the house was surrounded by protesters as well as police. The relatives insisted on guarantees that they <b>could</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> the child for several months and retain custody, and that González would not be returned to Cuba. Negotiations carried on throughout the night, but Reno claimed that the relatives rejected all workable solutions.|$|E
25|$|A host family {{volunteers to}} house {{a student from}} a {{different}} place during their exchange program visit. The family often doesn't receive any payment for hosting. Students are {{responsible for their own}} spending, including school fees, uniform, text books, internet, and phone calls. Host families could be family units with or without children or retired couples; most programs require one host to be at least 25 years of age. The host families are well prepared to experience a new culture and give a new cultural experience to the student. A student <b>could</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> more than one family in an exchange program to expand their knowledge and experience more of the new culture. Host families are responsible for providing a room, meals, and a stable family environment for the student. Most exchange programs allow for a switch of hosts if problems arise.|$|E

25|$|Chinese {{reaction}} against the MCP was {{shown by the}} formation of the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) in 1949 as a vehicle for moderate Chinese political opinion. Its leader Tan Cheng Lock favoured a policy of collaboration with UMNO to win Malayan independence on a policy of equal citizenship, but with sufficient concessions to Malay sensitivities to ease nationalist fears. Tan formed a close collaboration with Tunku (Prince) Abdul Rahman, the Chief Minister of Kedah and from 1951 successor to Datuk Onn as leader of UMNO. Since the British had announced in 1949 that Malaya would soon become independent whether the Malayans liked it or not, both leaders were determined to forge an agreement their communities <b>could</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> as a basis for a stable independent state. The UMNO-MCA Alliance, which was later joined by the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC), won convincing victories in local and state elections in both Malay and Chinese areas between 1952 and 1955.|$|E

500|$|According to Stewart O'Nan of The Atlantic, Cal's {{narration}} {{evokes the}} style of the picaresque novel, retelling events that have already occurred and foreshadowing the future through [...] "portentous glimpses". Francisco Collado-Rodríguez, a professor of American literature, classified the beginning of Middlesex as a historiographical and metafictional chronicle for its discussion of events such as the Greco-Turkish war and the Great Fire of Smyrna. He also considered the first section of the novel as a tragicomedy about the Stephanides' migration from Greece and assimilation into America. Soar posited Desdemona and Lefty's passage as a romantic comedy: the lovers, brother and sister, pretend to be strangers who meet for the first time, attempting [...] "to unknow themselves, to remythologise themselves by developing a past they <b>could</b> <b>live</b> <b>with,</b> unfamiliar and therefore permissible". As the story progresses, Middlesex becomes a social novel about Detroit, discussing the seclusion of living in a 1970s suburb. At the end of the novel, the story adopts the tone of the detective genre.|$|E

Michael C. Hall called the ending a [...] "really bold stroke" [...] that would reset the stage of the series just as the Dexter Morgan character began to feel he <b>could</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> an emotional connection to his wife and family.

[...] Indeed, the NORC reported that 73% of subjects in the study said that they <b>could</b> <b>live</b> indefinitely <b>with</b> eight sonic booms per day, while 25% said that they couldn't.

Sarmiento likewise refuse to recant his editorials. He wrote to his father, [...] "To back off now would be an abandonment of principles I believe in and a tarnish on my integrity as an individual.

Lowell asked Tate if he <b>could</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> him and his wife, and Tate joked that if Lowell wanted to, Lowell could pitch a tent on Tate's lawn; then Lowell went to Sears, Roebuck to purchase a tent that he set up on Tate's lawn and lived in for two months.
