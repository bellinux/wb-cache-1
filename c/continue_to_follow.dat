5|$|In {{the knot}} of {{highways}} that is the Genesee County seat, NY33 crosses and briefly overlaps with not only NY5, the other east–west route in town, but both north–south routes, NY63 and NY98. While concurrent with NY98 on Oak Street Extension, NY33 passes over Tonawanda Creek, which travels through Batavia on a roughly northwest–southeast alignment. The brief overlap with NY98 ends at Main Street, which carries NY5 and NY63 through the western portion of the city. NY33 turns east here, overlapping with NY5 and NY63 for five blocks along the four-lane, mostly commercial Main Street. NY63 leaves in downtown Batavia at Ellicott Street; however, NY5 and NY33 <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> Main Street {{through much of the}} city's eastern half.|$|E

NY434 bends northeastward as a result, running past several scattered businesses on the outskirts of Apalachin before finally leaving the community. Occasional stretches of homes <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the route to the county line, where the road widens from two to four lanes and becomes a divided highway.|$|E
25|$|Grant’s gazelles {{sexually mature}} at 18 months. Territory-holding bucks mate more than ones in {{bachelor}} groups. The courting ritual {{begins with a}} buck following a doe, {{waiting for her to}} urinate. When she does, the male does the Flehmen response to determine if she is in estrus. If she is, he will <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> her. The female will lift her tail, signaling she is ready to mate, and the male will mount her. The gestation period for the gazelle lasts for 198 days. Births peak in January and February. A doe will leave her herd and find a well-hidden place to give birth. Afterwards, the female eats the afterbirth and other fluids to keep the fawn clean and scentless. Females that have recently given birth will stay together for protection. The does nurse their fawns four times a day. Fawns are immobile for the first few days, so the mother stays close by. When the fawn can walk, it leaves with its mother to find a herd. Around this time, fawns will associate with one another in peer groups. A gazelle is weaned at six months, but will continue to associate with its mother until adolescence.|$|E
