2500|$|The {{newspaper}} {{report on}} 2 March 1960 described how a tsunami {{was reported to}} have come ashore shortly after the earthquake, stating [...] "A tidal wave <b>curled</b> <b>in</b> across the white beaches and lanced [...] into the town. The city dock was cut in two, a Spanish shipmaster radioed." [...] A tsunami disaster was later refuted by a report from the American Iron and Steel Institute after a team of earthquake engineers, including Ray W. Clough from the University of California, Berkeley, surveyed the damage and building failures throughout the Agadir area in March 1960. The report of their findings stated that the port facilities suffered damage due to fairly uniform subsidence in the harbor area that was responsible for knocking over five large cranes, but no evidence of nor any reliable witness to large waves was found, {{with the exception of a}} Dutch freighter crew who stated that large swells in the harbor did cause the separation of their mooring lines at the time of the earthquake. A report in a 1964 issue of the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America also denied the existence of a destructive tsunami because of a lack of evidence from a nearby tide gauge.|$|E
