Methodology. The research is carried out using the train traffic safety theory and mathematical modelling of hump processes. Findings. The current technical standard documents regulating the operational performance of humps do not contain direct instructions on how to proceed in the event of brake power loss by <b>car</b> <b>retarders,</b> thus creating threats to the traffic safety. This problem is quite acute for the Ukrainian railways in connection with a chronic shortage of funds for the repair and renewal of technical equipment, including the humps. At the same time, a significant drop in the volume of work leads {{to the fact that the}} hump required processing capacity can be provided in case of partial failure of retarders as well. Herewith the most important task is to ensure the breaking-up safety in conditions of parametric failures of retarders. The analysis of dangerous situations, the occurrence of which is possible at humps, as well as the modelling of cut rolling, allowed establishing the connection between the value of retarder tire pressing force on the car wheels and the breaking-up modes, providing the safety of marshalling process. The paper sets the application areas of such measures as the breaking-up speed reduction, breaking-up termination, the use of additional braking by block hangers. Originality. The originality of the work lies in the fact that it first obtained the complex of dependencies that determine the performance requirements for the power of hump retarders and allow the staff to enter the appropriate limits for breaking-up modes to ensure the marshalling process safety. Practical value. The results of the research can be used to supplement the «Instruction on the maintenance of facilities of mechanized and automated humps» in order to determine the limits of breaking-up modes when detecting the reduction of retarder power below the nominal one...|$|R

These systems regulate the process of car rolling from the hump, and for this purpose, determine the necessary exit speed from each retarder positions. To solve this problem, a significant number of various sensors are included in the automation system. They make it possible to specify the weight of cars, their running resistance, velocity and direction of wind, and other parameters necessary to control the retarders. Problems in controlling the process of cut rolling from the hump arise because of the errors in measuring these parameters, as well as because of random errors in controlling of <b>cars,</b> in the <b>retarders,</b> to the desired exit speed. We do not mean to lessen the importance of this approach, but {{it should be noted that}} there is an alternative approach for solving the problem. It is based on the improvement of the control algorithm of retarder positions and makes it possible to ensure a reliable separation of cuts at the switches even in the conditions of uncertainty.|$|R
