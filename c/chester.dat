5|$|<b>Chester</b> {{had planned}} to retire in June 2009, and the {{congregation}} embarked on {{a search for a}} new senior rabbi in 2008. Twenty-three candidates were narrowed down to one finalist, but in early December that individual informed the search committee that he was withdrawing his name from consideration. While the search was progressing, <b>Chester</b> had realized that, due to the 2008 financial crisis, he would have to keep working. After the main candidate withdrew, the synagogue's president approached <b>Chester,</b> asking if he would stay on for another term, which <b>Chester</b> agreed to do. <b>Chester</b> retired in June 2011, becoming (along with Broude) Rabbi Emeritus.|$|E

5|$|In 1804, the Ellesmere company {{offered to}} buy out the <b>Chester</b> Canal for 1,000 of their shares, and to take over debts up to £4,000. The <b>Chester</b> Canal held out for more, and the {{negotiations}} failed. Three years later, the financial position of the <b>Chester</b> Canal was better, and they began paying off their debts. Finally in 1813, they agreed to amalgamate, and the action was authorised by a further Act of Parliament. The Ellesmere company paid just half of their 1804 offer, and the 500 Ellesmere shares were distributed between the various <b>Chester</b> shareholders. The Ellesmere and <b>Chester</b> Canal Company took over on 1 July 1813. A new section of canal and an iron lock were built at Beeston in 1827, to resolve continual problems with leakage there.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Chester</b> Archaeological Society, {{founded in}} 1849, {{acquired}} artefacts discovered in <b>Chester</b> and undertook excavations where possible; the Grosvenor Museum was opened in 1886 {{to allow the}} public to view the society's collection. The society continued to work in <b>Chester,</b> recording information on the fortress and its surrounding settlement, often as building works destroyed the sites. Between 1962 and 1999, about 50excavations were carried out {{in and around the}} fortress, revealing new information about Deva Victrix. Between 2007 and 2009, excavations were carried out at the amphitheatre on behalf of <b>Chester</b> City Council and in association with English Heritage.|$|E

5|$|A {{civilian}} settlement, or canabae, grew {{around the}} fortress. <b>Chester</b> Roman Amphitheatre south-west of the fortress {{is the largest}} known military amphitheatre in Britain. The civilian settlement remained after the Romans departed, eventually becoming the present-day city of <b>Chester.</b> There were peripheral settlements around Roman Deva, including Boughton, {{the source of the}} garrison's water supply, and Handbridge, the site of a sandstone quarry and the Minerva Shrine.

5|$|Although the <b>Chester</b> Canal was not {{a success}} as traffic was sparse, this changed once it was {{connected}} to the Ellesmere Canal. The Ellesmere company expected to carry limestone from the quarries at Llanymynech and Trevor, iron from the ironworks at Ruabon and Bersham, and coal from mines at Chirk, Ruabon and Wrexham to <b>Chester,</b> Liverpool and Shrewsbury. The canal to Bersham and Wrexham was not built, and that to Shrewsbury was built much later on, but trade in coal, limestone, lime and building materials developed within the network of canals, and traffic between the canals and Liverpool increased steadily, much of it passing along the former <b>Chester</b> Canal. Receipts for the Ellesmere Canal were £12,568 in 1807 and £15,707 just two years later.|$|E
50|$|As well as {{his work}} in the city, Clayton was an antiquarian. Four years after his birth in 1792, his father {{purchased}} the <b>Chesters</b> Estate, through which Hadrian's Wall runs, and which contained the site of <b>Chesters</b> fort. Landscaping a parkland setting for his home, The <b>Chesters,</b> Nathaniel Clayton levelled out and grassed over much of the Roman fort. While doing so he collected antiquities. From an early age John Clayton took a serious interest not only in the fort of <b>Chesters</b> and its immediate surroundings, but also in Roman remains in the nearby countryside.|$|R

5|$|Another major {{influence}} {{in his work}} was the rise of interest in vernacular architecture. By the time Douglas moved to <b>Chester,</b> the black-and-white revival using half-timbering was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in <b>Chester</b> and elsewhere. The black-and-white revival did not start in <b>Chester,</b> but it did become Chester's speciality. The first <b>Chester</b> architect involved in the revival had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early <b>Chester</b> architects involved in the revival were T.A.Richardson and James Harrison and {{it came to be}} developed mainly by T. M. Lockwood and by Douglas. Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white. Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the Tudor style. These include tile-hanging, pargetting and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries.|$|E

5|$|By {{the latter}} part of the 16th-century Reformation, the Church had grown less {{tolerant}} of mystery plays.

This production was received enthusiastically, and was repeated the following year; thereafter it became a regular feature and tourist attraction.|$|E

His first-team return came on 22 November 2008 after entering Barnsley's 2–1 defeat away to Preston North End as an 90th-minute substitute.

On 16 October 2009, Coulson signed a one-month loan deal with Conference Premier club <b>Chester</b> City, making his debut on 17 October 2009 against Gateshead in a 1–0 home victory.
