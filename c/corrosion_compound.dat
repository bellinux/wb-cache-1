Effluent gases emitted to the environment during combustion operations can lead to degradation of high temperature materials with deleterious effects on mechanical integrity and the corrosion of alloys. This paper focuses on sulphidation of one quaternary, and four ternary, Pt-based superalloys of various chemical compositions. Pt-based superalloys were exposed at 900 °C in a reducing environment. The alloys were compared to coated and uncoated Ni-based superalloys (NBSAs). X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize corrosion products that formed. The Pt-based superalloys exhibited higher corrosion resistance than NBSAs {{as a result of the}} formation of a protective Al 2 O 3 scale, whereas NBSAs suffered internal sulphidation and formed Cr and Ni sulphide <b>corrosion</b> <b>compounds.</b> The formation of brittle needle-like phases and the transformation of the NiAl phase to Ni 3 Al, led to early failure of the coated alloy.

Several Roman and Phoenician-Punic gold, silver and copper-based, gold and silver-plated artefacts characterised by a wide compositional range and different metallurgical nature have been studied to identify the microchemical surface structure and the metallurgical features. Four case studies are reported. The investigation was carried out by means of the combined use of surface and microanalytical techniques, such as XPS, X-ray diffraction and SEM equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The results revealed that the artefacts surface is characterised by a thin layer of insoluble corrosion products like AgCl, Ag 2 S or AgCuS, CuS, Cu 2 O, Pb or Cu-carbonates mixed to form a complex composite structure. The presence and the concentrations of these <b>corrosion</b> <b>compounds</b> is strongly related to the archaeological context.
