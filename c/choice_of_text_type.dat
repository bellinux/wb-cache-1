40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{research}} into micro-interactions within the reading literacy event Reading on the Mat in three Grade One classrooms. This event {{is the core}} of literacy learning in Foundation Phase classrooms in formerly ‘white’, government-funded primary schools in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, and takes place daily for every child. It is literacy practice resembling Group Guided Reading. The research focused on teachers’ identity-forming decisions, actions and discourses as a way of examining micro-interactions within the literacy event. Hymes’s work on the ethnography of communication provided categories for the investigation. Using an ethnographic approach, I entered the sites of the study as a participant observer. There I focused on the central literacy event, in which a group of children and the teacher sit in close proximity. I made field notes, video recordings and audio recordings in three sets of visits spanning the full school year. These were supplemented by teacher interviews, consideration of reports and assessments, and an analysis <b>of</b> the <b>text</b> <b>types</b> used on the Mat, for example, graded readers, flash cards and phonics primers. Beginning with Hymes’ S. P. E. A. K. I. N. G. mnemonic, cycles of analysis using multiple instruments foregrounded the data. The central finding of this research is that in Reading on the Mat children are offered identities through strong normative work and embedded practices. Teachers promote positive identities for children as successful readers and create positive affect for reading activities. This positive positioning work is however undercut by three factors: first, the fact that activities on the Mat focus on decoding text fragments rather than interrogating whole texts. The resultant identity offered to children is one of code breakers alone. A finding subsidiary to this, but important for pedagogic practice, is that teachers’ <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> <b>types</b> is the most powerful determinant of children’s code breaker identity. A second factor that undercuts children’s identity as successful readers is that, although they are active, they have little agency. This derives from the strong assessment focus of teachers on the Mat and their questioning practices. A third factor which undercuts the positive identity children are offered in this literacy event is that, by focusing primarily on decoding fragmented text and on assessment opportunities, teachers avoid engaging with issues of differentiation and disregard cultural and linguistic differences. Teachers’ choices, therefore, while creating a positive climate in the classroom and developing emergent readers who are effective decoders, construct children as limited literate subjects. The same choices enable teachers to ignore learner diversity. Adobe Acrobat 9. 54 Paper Capture Plug-i...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the nature of talk that surrounds the literacy events of read aloud, guided reading, and literature discussion in an early childhood literacy program. This research describes how teachers promote and sustain talk, and describes the characteristics of student talk in each event. Examining the broad themes of talk that emerged provided a window into students' thinking and meaning making in these pedagogical strategies. This naturalistic, qualitative inquiry borrowed from two research traditions: case study and grounded theory. Five kindergarten students were audio-taped for three months as they participated in whole class read aloud, small group guided reading, and small group literature discussion. Transcriptions of talk, interviews, and field notes were analyzed to uncover the interactions between students and teachers, the content of talk, and the meanings students created. Analys{{is included}} open and selective coding and constant comparative analysis to reach data saturation. Data were further scrutinized through the lenses of conversation and discourse analysis. Research findings suggest that each literacy event helped nurture behaviors and knowledge necessary for developing readers. In guided reading the teacher dominated the talk, focusing on reading skills and strategies. In the read aloud and literature discussion group, the students had more influence over the direction of the conversation, and generated comments and questions, expressing their understanding <b>of</b> the <b>text,</b> ideas, and opinions. During the course of the three month study, students in the literature discussion group demonstrated they were capable of sophisticated conversations, at times edging into critical literacy. The teacher played a crucial role in fostering student's thinking in all events through her <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>text,</b> the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> questions she asked, and how long she paused for student talk. The overarching implication of this study is that the literacy task, as defined by the teacher, determines the kind of language she uses. This in turn, impacts the language and learning of her students. Further discussion addresses implications about the role <b>of</b> talk about <b>text</b> in emergent literacy programs...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the use <b>of</b> conjunctions in <b>texts,</b> {{and in particular}} their function as a marker <b>of</b> <b>text</b> <b>type.</b> Children's acquisition <b>of</b> this aspect of conjunction usage is the main focus. An examination of the characteristics <b>of</b> various <b>text</b> <b>types</b> {{and the nature of}} coordinate and subordinate conjunctions in English serves as a framework within which the experimental evidence from adults and children (aged three to five) is considered. Three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> [...] conversation, narratives, and game explanations [...] were collected. It was found that both the types of conjunctions used and the frequency of conjunctions as a class vary according to text type; conjunctions are much more frequent in narratives and explanations than in conversation. It is shown here that pragmatic or cognitive factors cannot account for these findings; they can only be explained as a function <b>of</b> <b>text</b> <b>type.</b> The data from the children provide evidence that their conjunction usage is also constrained by <b>text</b> <b>type,</b> although their patterns of use are not exactly the same as the adults'.

40|$|The {{control theory}} of driving {{suggests}} that driver distraction {{can be analyzed}} as a breakdown of control at three levels. Common approach for analyzing distraction experimentally is to utilize capacity-based measures to assess distraction {{at the level of}} operational control. Three driving simulation experiments with 61 participants were organized to evaluate which kind of measures could be used to analyze drivers' tactical visual sampling models and the related effects of distraction while searching textual information on in-car display. The effects <b>of</b> two different <b>text</b> <b>types</b> were evaluated. The utilized capacity-based measures seemed to be insufficient for revealing participants' tactical behaviors or effects <b>of</b> <b>text</b> <b>type.</b> The measures <b>of</b> workload or performance did not indicate reliably the differences found between participants' visual sampling strategies or which <b>text</b> <b>type</b> is better for enabling safer task timing behaviors. Visual sampling measures did indicate effects <b>of</b> <b>text</b> <b>type</b> on participants' tactical abilities. Differences in participants' visual sampling strategies leading to different levels of systematicity in visual behaviors can explain the variances in visual sampling efficiency. Displays encouraging unsystematic glance allocation behaviors were found potentially the most distracting in relation to safe visual sampling of in-vehicle displays...|$|R

30|$|The ‘over-all {{structural}} shape’ {{presented in}} Hasan ([1978]) is better {{treated as a}} generalised formula. It consists of a configuration of functional elements whose mutual relations are calibrated {{in such a way}} as to allow its use to describe the structure of not only a specific <b>text</b> <b>type</b> but also a range <b>of</b> other related <b>text</b> <b>types.</b> Each member <b>of</b> that range <b>of</b> <b>text</b> <b>types</b> will have some structural properties in common with other members: no individual <b>text</b> <b>type</b> will have the same structural shape as any other, and none will be entirely different. The entire range <b>of</b> such <b>text</b> <b>types</b> will constitute a single register family. The variations across <b>text</b> <b>types</b> are clearly not accidental. They are based on the text-context relations: underlying these similarities and differences in the structural shapes of the members of a register family there will be specifiable similarities and differences in the selection of features from the dimension of field and/or tenor and/or mode of discourse. The actual structural shape <b>of</b> a <b>text</b> is not the achievement of that particular text: despite its uniqueness, it is recognised by its regularities which arise from the speaker’s meaning-wording as a response to the context <b>of</b> situation: the <b>text</b> is realising in a specific type of CC. The study of register is a study of the regularities between the features of CC and their realisation as text.|$|R
