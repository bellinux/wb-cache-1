5|$|It's about obsession, {{and that}} can be scary because you're not in control and you don't know where it's going to stop.

And it's not just a pleasurable feeling that <b>comes</b> <b>back,</b> it's the complete terror and loss of control that <b>comes</b> <b>back.</b> And I think that's ultimately a great weapon.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the novel, the narrator, and by extension McGregor, treats disorganized workers with scorn; from the miners of Coal Creek, to the downtrodden laborers of Chicago who are shown mastered by their bosses (unlike McGregor, who does not follow this trend).

Indeed, this realization is foreshadowed in Chapter 3 of Book I when as a young man he sees a troupe of marching soldiers disperse a rowdy mob of miner's (and, as a consequence, save his family's bakery) during a strike.|$|E

5|$|The multifidus muscles run up {{and down}} along the back of the spine, and are {{important}} for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and lifting. A problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain, because the back pain causes the person to use the back muscles improperly in trying to avoid the pain. The problem with the multifidus muscles continues even after the pain goes away, and is probably an important reason why the pain <b>comes</b> <b>back.</b> Teaching people with chronic low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.|$|E
