40|$|We {{examine the}} first order Fermi {{acceleration}} on the presumption that supernova remnant shocks cross ambient magnetic fields with various angles. These oblique shocks accelerate particles more efficiently than the parallel shocks and elevate the maximum energies achievable by the particles. The primary cosmic ray spectrum is strongly dependent upon these energies. We also consider the dependence of the injection efficiency and of spectral indices on obliquity. When indices and absolute fluxes at $ 10 ^{ 12 }$ eV are given for six nuclear groups from balloon-borne data, each energy spectrum develops a smooth rigidity dependent knee structure. The resultant total spectrum also behaves similarly and fits well with ground-based experimental data up to several $ 10 ^{ 17 }$ eV. It is shown as well that the chemical composition changes significantly from lighter to heavier nuclei as the energies of particles exceed the knee region. Other predicted curves are compared with the experimental data which they reproduce rather well.

The characteristics of the sharp-nosed airfoils are compared with those of the normal Gott. 398 airfoil. Both of the sharp-nosed airfoils, which differ in the angle between the upper and lower surfaces at the leading edge, have about the same characteristics. As compared with the normal airfoil, the maximum lift is reduced by approximately 26 per cent, but the objectionable rapidly decreasing lift with angle of attack beyond the stall is eliminated; the profile drag of the section is slightly reduced in the range of the lift coefficient between 0. 2 and 0. 85, but at higher and lower lift coefficients the drag is increased...|$|E

40|$|The {{micro-electro-mechanical system}} (MEMS) {{resonator}} developed based on surface processing technology usually changes the section shape either due to excessive etching or insufficient etching. In this paper, a section parameter is proposed {{to describe the}} microbeam changes in {{the upper and lower}} sections. The effect of section change on the mechanical properties is studied analytically and verified through numerical and finite element solutions. A doubly-clamped microbeam-based resonator, which is actuated by an electrode on one side, is investigated. The higher-order model is derived without neglecting the effects of neutral plane stretching and electrostatic nonlinearity. Further, the Galerkin method and Newton–Cotes method are used to reduce the complexity and order of the derived model. First of all, the influence of microbeam shape and gap variation on the static pull-in are studied. Then, the dynamic analysis of the system is investigated. The method of multiple scales (MMS) is applied to determine the response of the system for small amplitude vibrations. The relationship between the microbeam shape and the frequency response is discussed. Results show that the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>section</b> and gap distance can make the vibration soften, harden, and so on. Furthermore, when the amplitude of vibration is large, the frequency response softening effect is weakened by the MMS. If the nonlinearity shows hardening-type behavior at the beginning, with the increase of the amplitude, the frequency response will shift from hardening to softening behavior. The large amplitude in-well motions are studied to investigate the transitions between hardening and softening behaviors.

For the opportunity to sit and talk with Ian Callinan AC who, in compliance with that amendment, retired from the High Court in September 2007, I needed to wait until he returned from The Hague where he was sitting as a Judge ad hoc on the International Court of Justice. Although a native of Casino, New South Wales, Mr Callinan is regarded as a Queenslander. Indeed, he grew up in Brisbane, finished high school at Brisbane Grammar and graduated in law at The University of Queensland. Appointed in 1978 as a Queen’s Counsel, Mr Callinan enjoyed this period of his legal career and we discussed an aspect of the Christopher Skase case, which reinforced my belief that Mr Callinan is an incredibly skilful advocate. On 14 September 1998, ABC Four Corners broadcasted the views of some prominent Australians on the appointment of Mr Callinan to the High Court. In assessing the type of person Mr Callinan is, Tony Morris QC said: “Ian Callinan isn't a coward”, while former Commonwealth Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, said: “He was regarded as an absolutely outstanding criminal lawyer within the Queensland legal profession, I mean really a top-notch advocate”. I was not interested in raising any of the controversial issues that Mr Callinan has encountered as an advocate in high profile matters. I wanted to know how he felt about his time on the High Court, what his thoughts are on the operation of the High Court, the IP cases he decided, the real life issues that he feels impact on counsel who are appearing before the High Court and the people he regarded as role models. During our conversation, Mr Callinan laughed often and when he did his eyes lit up, revealing his passion for life. He is an incredibly genuine Australian who loved his time as a barrister, enjoyed his role on the High Court, enjoys his current job as mediator, loves writing novels, has a great desire for continual improvement in the quality of legal education and legal advocacy and sees a need for change in IP law.

40|$|This {{research}} project {{was carried out}} at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics (VKI), in Belgium, in collaboration and with the funding of Centre Technique des Industries Mécaniques (CETIM) in France. The flow of a mixture of two fluids in pipes can be frequently encountered in nuclear, chemical or mechanical engineering, where gas-liquid eactors, boilers, condensers, evaporators and combustion systems can be used. The presence of section changes or more generally geometrical singularities in pipes may affect significantly the behavior of twophase flow and subsequently the resulting pressure drop and mass flow rate. Therefore, {{it is an important}} subject of investigation in particular when the application concerns industrial safety valves. This thesis is intended to provide a thorough research on two-phase (air-water) flow phenomena under various circumstances. The project is split in the following steps. At first, experiments are carried out in simple geometries such as smooth and sudden divergence and convergence singularities. Two experimental facilities are built; one in smaller scale in von Karman Institute and one in larger scale in CETIM. During {{the first part of the}} study, relatively simple geometrical discontinuities are investigated. The characterization and modeling of contraction and expansion nozzles (sudden and smooth <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>section)</b> is carried out. The pressure evolution is measured and pressure drop correlations are deduced. Flow visualization is also performed with a high-speed camera; the different flow patterns are identified and flow regime maps are established for a specific configuration. A dual optical probe is used to determine the void fraction, bubble size and velocity upstream and downstream the singularities. In the second part of the project, a more complex device, i. e. a Safety Relief Valve (SRV), mainly used in nuclear and chemistry industry, is thoroughly studied. A transparent model of a specific type of safety valve (1 1 / 2 " G 3 ") is built and investigated in terms of pressure evolution. Additionally, flow rate measurements for several volumetric qualities and valve openings are carried out for air, water and two-phase mixtures. Full optical access allowed identification of the structure of the flow. The results are compared with measurements performed at the original industrial valve. Flowforce analysis is performed revealing that compressible and incompressible flowforces in SRV are inversed above a certain value of valve lift. This value varies with critical pressure ratio, therefore is directly linked to the position at which chocked flow occurs during air valve operation. In two-phase flow, for volumetric quality of air= 20 %, pure compressible flow behavior, in terms of flowforce, is remarked at full lift. Numerical simulations with commercial CFD code are carried out for air and water in axisymmetric 2 D model of the valve in order to verify experimental findings. The subject of modeling the discharge through a throttling device in two-phase flow is an important industrial problem. The proper design and sizing of this apparatus is a crucial issue which would prevent its wrong function or accidental operation failure that could cause a hazardous situation. So far reliability of existing models predicting the pressure drop and flow discharge in two-phase flow through the valve for various flow conditions is questionable. Nowadays, a common practice is widely adopted (standard ISO 4126 - 10 (2010), API RP 520 (2000)); the Homogeneous Equilibrium Method with the so-called !-method, although it still needs further validation. Additionally, based on !-methodology, Homogeneous Non-Equilibrium model has been proposed by Diener and Schmidt (2004) (HNE-DS), introducing a boiling delay coefficient. The accuracy of the aforementioned models is checked against experimental data both for transparent model and industrial SRV. The HNE-DS methodology is proved to be the most precise among the others. Finally, after application of HNE-DS method for air-water flow with cavitation, it is concluded that the behavior of flashing liquid is simulated in such case. Hence, for the specific tested conditions, this type of flow can be modeled with modified method of Diener and Schmidt (CF-HNE-DS) although further validation of this observation is required.

These solutions constitute an infinite set of modes, in addition to the plane wave usually treated in the literature. In section 3 the analogy between propagation of sound and an electrical transmission line is established, and it is shown that each mode requires a separate transmission line. In section 4 it is shown that the effect of the higher modes excited by a plane discontinuity may be represented by a lumped capacitance, and this capacitance is given by a variational expression which gives a systematic method of calculation yielding an upper bound to the true answer. For the case of a window, a variational principle is produced inihich gives a lower bound to the true answer.
