2500|$|What part of 'Japanese Army sex slaves' does Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, have so {{much trouble}} {{understanding}} and apologizing for? ... These were not commercial brothels. Force, explicit and implicit, was used in recruiting these women. What went on in them was serial rape, not prostitution. The Japanese Army's involvement is documented in the government's own defense files. A senior Tokyo official more or less apologized for this horrific crime in 1993...Yesterday, [...] grudgingly acknowledged the 1993 quasi-apology, but only {{as part of a}} pre-emptive declaration that his government would reject the <b>call,</b> <b>now</b> pending in the United States Congress, for an official apology.

2500|$|The book {{opens with}} former Ranger Captain Woodrow F. <b>Call</b> (<b>now</b> a bounty hunter) and Ned Brookshire, the [...] "salaried man" [...] of the title. [...] Brookshire {{has been sent}} to Texas from New York City by his boss, {{railroad}} tycoon Colonel Terry, to contract Call's services in apprehending a bandit. The bandit in question is a young Mexican named Joey Garza, who has cost Terry significant business and money through his deadly train robberies. Brookshire is surprised {{that the old man}} he encounters has such a reputation, though he notes that Call does have a rather dangerous and respect-demanding aura about him. Brookshire himself does not strike a particularly imposing figure, and soon proves not to be cut out for train or horse travel, inexperienced in the ways of the west or violence, and very homesick for his bossy but loving wife, Katie. Call, on the other hand, is the very picture of experience. Though he is old and seems almost to have trouble lifting his foot into the stirrups, his reputation speaks for him. He has spent forty years on the border and the frontier, many of those with his more talkative but equally respected late partner, Gus McCrae. Protecting settlers in innumerable skirmishes with hostile Indians, rustlers, and dangerous gangs has earned him {{a great deal of respect}} and a reputation that generally strikes fear into the hearts of criminals.|$|E
