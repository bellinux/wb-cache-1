40|$|Abstract Background There {{remains a}} lack of {{research}} on co-variation of multiple health outcomes and their socio-economic co-patterning, especially among the elderly. This papers aims to 1) {{examine the effects of}} different socio-economic factors on physical functioning and psychological well-being among older adults in a rural community in northern Vietnam; and 2) investigate {{the extent to which the}} two outcomes variables co-vary within individuals. Methods We analyzed the data from the WHO/INDEPTH study on global ageing and adult health conducted on 8535 people aged 50 years old and over in Bavi district of Vietnam in 2006. A multivariate response model was constructed to answer our research questions. The model treats the individual as a level two unit and the multiple measurements observed within an individual as a level one unit. Results Lower physical functioning and psychological well-being were found in 1) women; 2) older people; 3) people with lower education level; 4) people who were currently single; 5) respondents from poorer household; and 6) mountainous dwellers compared to that in those <b>of</b> other <b>category(ies)</b> <b>of</b> the same variable. Socioeconomic factors accounted for about 24 % and 7 % of variation in physical functioning and psychological well-being scores, respectively. The adjusted correlation coefficient (0. 35) indicates that physical functioning and psychological well-being did not strongly co-vary. Conclusions The present study shows that there exist problems of inequality in health among older adults in the study setting. This finding highlights the importance of analyzing multiple dimensions of health status simultaneously in inequality investigations. </p...|$|R

40|$|Virtual {{teaching}} and learning spaces (VTLS) are a type of e-learning based on information and communication technology (ICT) with wide possibilities of application. The objective is to evaluate the degree of students’ adherence to the virtual space (Moodle) used as a complementary pedagogical tool {{in the teaching of}} Anatomy. The Moodle system was used from March to July 2010. A standardized and regulated survey was implemented for students attending courses in Anatomy (Medicine - UBA) during July 2010 for 3 chairs. Usefulness of the pedagogical resource was assessed taking into account the number of enrolled students, time, and entry time range, frequency of access, benefit for the teaching process of discussion forums and available materials. Statistical tests were applied to results. We worked with 292 <b>users.</b> 128 <b>of</b> them correspond to the obligatory use and 164 to the optional use. 121 surveys were obtained (obligatory 69 %; optional 31 %). 98 % <b>of</b> <b>users</b> were between 19 and 28 years old. 70 % <b>of</b> <b>users</b> don´t work. 85 % <b>of</b> <b>users</b> didn’t have previous experience on e-learning. 94 % <b>of</b> <b>users</b> considered it practical and easy technologically speaking. 89 % <b>of</b> <b>users</b> considered that the material as a complement for the test turned out to be useful. 75 % <b>of</b> <b>users</b> incorporated it as a pedagogical tool. 87 % <b>of</b> <b>users</b> recommended it to their partners. 89 % <b>of</b> <b>users</b> considered that the complementary material for the theoretical classes was beneficial. 76 % <b>of</b> <b>users</b> considered that clinical cases were useful as integration. 78 % <b>of</b> <b>users</b> believed that the imaging tests were useful. 91 % <b>of</b> <b>users</b> used the material given by the associate professor. The professor-student feedback was beneficial for 70 % <b>of</b> <b>users,</b> and for 32 % <b>of</b> <b>users</b> among students. Anatomy doubts were responded in the forum for 50 % <b>of</b> <b>users,</b> and technological doubts were responded for 67 %.

In this work, we develop a formal theory <b>of</b> <b>user</b> behavior prediction based on specialized hidden Markov models. This approach learns the user model through time-series action analysis and abstraction.

40|$|Multi-user {{diversity}} is considered {{when the number}} <b>of</b> <b>users</b> in the system is random. The complete monotonicity of the error rate {{as a function of}} the (deterministic) number <b>of</b> <b>users</b> is established and it is proved that randomization of the number <b>of</b> <b>users</b> always leads to deterioration of average system performance at any average SNR. Further, using stochastic ordering theory, a framework for comparison of system performance for different user distributions is provided. For Poisson distributed users, the difference in error rate of the random and deterministic number <b>of</b> <b>users</b> cases is shown to asymptotically approach zero as the average number <b>of</b> <b>users</b> goes to infinity for any fixed average SNR. In contrast, for a finite average number <b>of</b> <b>users</b> and high SNR, it is found that randomization of the number <b>of</b> <b>users</b> deteriorates performance significantly, and the diversity order under fading is dominated by the smallest possible number <b>of</b> <b>users.</b> For Poisson distributed users communicating over Rayleigh faded channels, further closed-form results are provided for average error rate, and the asymptotic scaling law for ergodic capacity is also provided.
