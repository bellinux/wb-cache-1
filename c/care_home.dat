40|$|Amanda Phelan School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems, University College Dublin, Ireland Abstract: With {{a rising}} older person {{population}} with increasing life expectancies, {{the demand for}} <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> will increase in the future. Older people in <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> are particularly vulnerable due to their dependencies related to cognitive and/or functional self-care challenges. Although many <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> provide good <b>care,</b> maltreatment and abuse of older people can and does occur. One major step in preventing and addressing maltreatment in <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> is having comprehensive and responsive policy, which delineates national expectations that are locally implemented. This paper examines the literature related to maltreatment in <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> and argues for policy based on a multisystems approach. Policy needs to firstly acknowledge and address general societal issues which tacitly impact on older person care delivery, underpin how <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> and related systems should be operationalized, and finally delineate expected standards and outcomes for individual experience of care. Such a policy demands attention {{at every level of}} the health care and societal system. Furthermore, contemporary issues central to policy evolution in <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> are discussed, such as safeguarding education and training and fostering organization whistle-blowing protection.
