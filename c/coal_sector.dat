50|$|The livery {{of these}} wagons was of {{unpainted}} metal hoppers and black underframes. The hopper support framework was originally brown, then red {{with the introduction}} of the new Railfreight image in the late 1970s. When Railfreight re-invented itself in 1987, a new livery with yellow framework and a large <b>coal</b> <b>sector</b> logo on the hopper side was introduced. Under EWS the framework is now painted maroon. Merry-go-round hoppers were worked hard however, and the typical livery included a coating of coal dust. Some of the terminals served used stationary shunters to move the wagons forward at low speed. These often featured tyred wheels that gripped the wagon sides, resulting in horizontal streaks on the hopper sides.|$|E

50|$|Along with Greenpeace, WWF, Spanish energy {{companies}} and the regional authority of Galicia, ClientEarth has intervened regarding the European Commission's decision to approve subsidies to the Spanish coal industry. The approved plan gives preferential access to the wholesale electricity market in Spain for power plants that run on domestic coal. Spanish electricity utilities, including Gas Natural, Iberdrola and Endesa have claimed that this will force them to withdraw from contracts for cheaper imported coal and buy more expensive, lower-quality domestic coal, while the parties have also argued that the decision breaches European laws on state aid and the environment, and that the Spanish government aid will unfairly skew the European energy market. ClientEarth also expressed concern that, if the decision was allowed to stand, other countries {{may be tempted to}} use similar tactics to bolster their <b>coal</b> <b>sectors.</b> They and the other environmental groups rejected Spain's position that it was attempting to protect the nation's energy security, arguing that the country has an oversupply of natural gas and, at times, renewable energy.|$|R

40|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of economic transition, several countries in Eastern Europe have undertaken far-reaching programs to restructure their <b>coal</b> <b>sectors,</b> which in the 1990 s were {{in a state of}} deep crisis. One aspect of restructuring has been the closure of loss-making mines, which are often located in communities where the coal industry is the dominant employer, and the significant downsizing of the workforce. Mitigation efforts that are implemented at the time of mine closure (such as severance payments) are usually intended only for the laid-off workers. The authors examine the impact of mine closure on the entire community five years after mine closure in Romania, Russia, and Ukraine. Using quantitative and qualitative research methods and based on interviews with national, regional, and local experts, and members of the affected population, the authors describe the effect of mine closure and evaluate the various mitigation efforts that have been used by governments in such cases. They conclude with policy recommendations of broad relevance to programs of industrial restructuring in communities dominated by a single industry.

40|$|For a {{transitional}} economy such as China, some energy subsidies are reasonable, {{and sometimes even}} necessary for achieving social goals. However, with rising energy prices and environmental concerns, we see conflicts emerging between energy subsidies, energy demand/supply fundamentals and climate change considerations. Energy subsidies {{have important implications for}} sustainable development through their effects on energy use, efficiency and the choice of fuel source. This paper applies the price-gap approach to estimate China's energy subsidies. Results indicate that China's energy subsidies amounted to CNY 356. 73  billion in 2007, equivalent to 1. 43 % of GDP. Subsidies for oil products consumption are the largest, followed by subsidies for the electricity and <b>coal</b> <b>sectors.</b> Furthermore, a CGE model is used to analyze the economic impacts of energy subsidy reforms. Our findings show that removing energy subsidies will result in a significant fall in energy demand and emissions, but will have negative impacts on macroeconomic variables. We conclude that offsetting policies could be adopted such that certain shares of these subsidies are reallocated to support other sustainable development measures, which could lead to reducing energy intensity and favoring the environment.

At this production rate, the reserves will be used up in 61 years, i.e. around the year 2075. Not all of the productions can be exported due to there are Domestic Market Obligation (DMO) regulation which should fulfill the domestic market. In 2012, the DMO is 24.72%.

50|$|During the 1970s and 1980s Ceaușescu {{determined}} that Romania should be completely debt-free {{and sought to}} repay its foreign debt ahead of the repayment schedule agreed to by the country’s creditors.
