5|$|Barnes took {{advantage}} of his reprieve to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122, as Yardley made frequent bowling changes {{in an attempt to}} disrupt their progress. Wright <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> bowled a no ball, which Morris lofted into the crowd for six. Morris stopped shuffling, while Barnes decided to adopt a strategy of pre-emptively moving down the pitch to Laker. Earlier in the tour, Barnes had often been bowled or trapped lbw trying to force off breaks into the leg side. He drove Laker into the pavilion and Australia were 73/0 at lunch with Morris on 40 and Barnes 25, an overall lead of 208.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{came in to}} join Harvey at 189/4, who {{continued}} attacking, unperturbed by Miller's departure. Cranston <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> Harvey square drove and then hooked to deep square leg for two consecutive boundaries. Yardley moved a man from fine leg to the location where the previous hook had gone; Harvey responded by glancing a ball to where the fine leg fielder had been, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 204/4, with Harvey on 70.|$|E

5|$|The {{weather was}} fine as Australia started their second innings {{on the third}} morning. The Australian openers took a {{cautious}} approach to begin with, avoiding the hook shot and not playing at balls that {{were not going to}} hit the stumps, looking for a solid start. Both openers were given early reprieves. Barnes survived a stumping opportunity when he was 18. Laker <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> induced Morris into hitting an airborne ball back down the pitch, but he was slow to react to the possibility of a caught and bowled. According to O'Reilly, most other bowlers {{would have been able to}} reach the ball and attempt a catch. The openers took advantage to combine for an opening stand of 122. Wright <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> again bowled a no ball at the start of his spell, which Morris lofted into the crowd for six. After shuffling around with uncertainty at the start of his innings, Morris began to play more fluently. He was eventually bowled for 62, knocking a ball from Wright onto his stumps. The opening partnership laid the platform for Australia's 7/460 declared, which allowed them to set an imposing target of 596 and win by 409 runs to take a 20 series lead.|$|E

5|$|Astorias bridge crew called general {{quarters}} upon sighting the flares {{south of}} Savo, around 01:49. At 01:52, {{shortly after the}} Japanese searchlights <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> shells began falling around the ship, Astorias main gun director crews spotted the Japanese cruisers and opened fire. Astorias captain, awakened to find his ship in action, rushed to the bridge and ordered a ceasefire, fearful that his ship might be firing on friendly forces. As shells continued to cascade around his ship, the captain ordered firing resumed {{less than a minute}} later. Chōkai, however, had found the range, and Astoria was quickly hit by numerous shells and set afire. Between 02:00 and 02:15, Aoba, Kinugasa, and Kako joined Chōkai in pounding Astoria, destroying the cruiser's engine room and bringing the flaming ship to a halt. At 02:16, one of Astorias remaining operational main gun turrets fired at Kinugasas searchlight, but missed and hit Chōkais forward turret, putting the turret out of action and causing moderate damage to the ship.|$|E

5|$|Edrich <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> bowled a bouncer, which Bradman {{tried to}} swing to the leg side, but instead the edge {{went in the}} air and landed behind point. On 13, Bradman played a Bedser ball from his legs, {{narrowly}} evading Hutton in the trap at short fine leg. After one hour he was on 14. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Doug Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. At the lunch break, Australia were 1/82 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. Shortly afterwards, in the third over after the resumption of play, with the score at 87, Bradman was caught for 38 for the third consecutive time in Tests by Hutton off Bedser at short fine leg, just two days after falling the same way in the second innings against Yorkshire. According to O'Reilly, this was evidence that Bradman was no longer the player he was before World War II, as he had been unable to disperse the close-catching fielders by counter-attacking, before eventually being dismissed. O'Reilly said that {{this was the first time}} that Bradman had fallen to the same trap three times in succession. Australia reached 7/258 at the end of day one, before a lower order burst took them to 350 on the second morning.|$|E
5|$|Emmett's {{departure}} brought Lindwall's tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised his speedster not to bowl any bouncers at Edrich, fearing {{such actions}} would {{be interpreted as}} retaliation and provoke a negative media and crowd reaction. After not bowling in the first innings, Miller <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> immediately broke through Washbrook's defences, only to see the ball graze the stumps without dislodging the bails. Washbrook then drove Lindwall for four before Miller bounced him in the next over. After two Miller outswingers had evaded the outside edge of Washbrook, the batsman appeared unsettled. One bouncer was hit over square leg in an uncontrolled manner for a four, and another flew in the air, narrowly evading Loxton at fine leg. Lindwall followed Miller's lead towards Washbrook and was no balled by umpire Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line. Following a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the matter faded away and the bowler was not no balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} debut as a second-half {{substitute}} in Valencia's Champions League group-stage defeat {{at home to}} Chelsea, and started the next league match, another home defeat against Espanyol, but was selected only infrequently either by Quique Flores, who had signed him, or by successor Ronald Koeman. With the transfer window approaching, Koeman had given Žigić two weeks to convince him he was worth keeping. Prior to the Copa del Rey on 19 December, Valencia had not scored for six matches, and they were soon 1–0 down to third-tier opponents Real Union. Žigić <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> scored twice to turn the match around, and followed up with another goal three days later as Valencia came from behind to secure a 2–2 draw at Real Zaragoza. A mooted loan to English club Portsmouth fell through when Koeman {{changed his mind about}} the player leaving, but he made only nine league appearances (two starts) in what remained of the season, and was sent off in the first of those.|$|E

5|$|May {{brought on}} the {{part-time}} spin of Brian Close and 15 runs came in two overs, helping Davidson {{to feel more}} at ease. At the time, Allen had bowled 25 maidens in 37 overs. Davidson responded to the situation by hitting Allen out of the attack. In Allen's 10th over for the day, Davidson took 20 runs. He lofted an off drive over the boundary for six, and drove through the covers for four from both {{the front and back}} foot. Davidson then hit the bowler out of the stadium onto the adjacent railway lines. Fred Trueman <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> struck Davidson on the foot with a yorker. Davidson responded with a three and a cut for four that brought up Australia's 400. He ended with a hard-hitting 77 not out, after a final wicket partnership of 98 in 102 minutes. This extended Australia's lead to 256 on the last day and gave them hope of stopping England from winning the match. England looked to be heading towards victory with seven wickets in hand and less than 100 runs required, but a Benaud-inspired collapse saw Australia home by 54 runs. Davidson knocked Brian Statham's off stump out of the ground to end the match and ended with 2/50. It was Australia's first victory at Old Trafford since 1902 and sealed the series.|$|E

The first of his wickets was that of Brian Lara which gave him impressive maiden scalps in both formats of the game.

25|$|Loch Vennachar was {{considered}} an unlucky ship narrowly surviving a cyclone in the Indian Ocean in June 1892. Around 8pm on 3 June, the barometer began to fall ominously and the sail was promptly shortened. At approximately 5.00am as darkness lifted it showed terrific head seas that swept down upon the vessel, lashed by the North-East gale. Two large waves approached the ship. Loch Vennachar rode the first wave and sank into the trough at the other side. While in this position, the second wave <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> broke on deck {{with such force that}} it broke the foremast, mainmast and the mizzen topmast. Without her masts to steady her, the Loch Vennachar rolled dangerously in heavy seas. After 9 days, the weather eased and the crew were able to rig a spar forward and sail on the damaged mizzen. After 5 weeks of sailing, she arrived at Port Louis, Mauritius. Although her stay lasted 5 months while new spars were sent from England, repairs only took 10 days to complete. Captain Bennett was awarded the Lloyd's Medal for his leadership and bravery at sea.|$|E
25|$|Ray Lindwall {{returned}} to Test bowling by dismissing Len Hutton {{with a beautiful}} swinging ball which moved from middle stump to flick {{the edge of his}} bat and was caught by Colin McCool at first slip. Bill Edrich joined Cyril Washbrook and together they took the score to 147/1 {{by the end of the}} second day, Edrich hit 10 fours in his 85 while Washbrook struck only 1 four in his 54. Resuming in the morning Lindwall (2/62) had Erich lbw for 89, much to his disappointment as like McCool he had been promised £1 a run if he made a century. Edrich had now made the highest score in the last three England innings (71, 119 and 89) and had returned the best figures in the last two Australian innings (3/79 and 3/50) and looked good for a big score. When he {{returned to}} the England dressing room he complained that he had hit the ball into his pads and should not have been out. This was overheard by an English pressman and was widely reported, becoming a major point of contention, especially as Denis Compton out lbw to Ernie Toshack when padding up of a ball that landed outside the stumps, causing the Middlesex player to stare at Umpire Scott in disbelief before his walked off. Wally Hammond <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>and,</b> annoyed at the two dismissals, gave a simple caught-and-bowled to Bruce Dooland, who then caught and bowled Cyril Washbrook for 62 and England had collapsed from 155/1 to 179/5. Jack Ikin (48) and Norman Yardley (61) dug in for two over hours and restored the innings with a stand of 113 until McCool (2/53) bowled the vice-captain and Dooland (4/69) removed Ikin and Voce with successive balls. With England 298/8 there was still a chance that they could overtake Australia for the first time in the series. Godfrey Evans made 17 and added 26 with Alec Bedser who swung the bat for 27 not out making 27 runs for the last wicket with Wright until the spinner was bowled by Johnson and England were out for 351, 14 runs behind.|$|E
500|$|January saw Arsenal's title {{challenge}} falter; {{the team}} {{went on a}} four-match winless run. At home, they only merited draws to Wimbledon, Aston Villa and QPR – the latter two were scoreless. Arsenal were beaten 2–0 by Liverpool on 29 January 1992; journalist Derek Hodgson said this was in spite of playing [...] "crisper" [...] and more confident football. A draw against Manchester United on 1 February 1992 came before a win away to Notts County. A crowd of 22,352 witnessed Arsenal draw once more at home, this time against Norwich City. Rockets were launched on the pitch during the match by Arsenal supporters, in protest of the club's bond scheme. Arsenal recorded their biggest win of the season, scoring seven past Sheffield Wednesday, on 15 February 1992. Campbell, who began the match as a substitute, <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> scored two goals; six of Arsenal's goals came in the second half. Arsenal ended February with a 1–1 draw away to Tottenham. After 30 games, the team were in sixth position, 18 points behind Manchester United in first.|$|E

500|$|Eighteen-year-old McLean {{made his}} debut on 17 October 2010, coming on as a {{substitute}} in a 2–2 draw against Hamilton. St Mirren were 2–0 down when he <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> their manager, Danny Lennon, {{thought that they were}} going to lose anyway so he would bring a youngster on. However, The Herald noted that McLean's [...] "drive and energy" [...] lifted St Mirren and helped them to turn the game around and get a draw. Three days after his debut, McLean made his first start for St Mirren, in a 3–0 loss to Hearts. Later in the week he signed a three-year contract extension, tying him to the club until 2014. He then made his first home start, in a 1–0 loss to Celtic on 16 November. After this match he thanked his manager for having faith in him and also said that he was amazed by the fact that only six months before he was playing in the Second Division relegation play-off, but was now playing against some of the best players in the country. He went on to make a total of 23 appearances during the 2010–11 season.|$|E
500|$|The New Directions closing {{number at}} Sectionals, [...] "Valerie", {{received}} the most commentary, with Santana's solo given enthusiastic praise, though Brittany and Mike's dancing was also lauded. Hankinson, who had tepidly called songs [...] "nice" [...] up to this point, shifted gears and said, [...] "Then Santana burns the roof down with a rendition of Amy Winehouse's 'Valerie'. It was awesome." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal echoed that fervor: [...] "But then Santana <b>came</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> killed. With an on-spot rendition of Mark Ronson/Amy Winehouse's 'Valerie,' and wearing a Snooki bun, Santana was electrifying behind the mic, in an energizing display that revved up the audience", and added, [...] "Brittany and Mike's pas de deux rocked". Benigno opined that [...] "Brittany and Mike Chang handle the moves (extraordinarily well), but the vocals here are what steal it. Naya Rivera (Santana) is completely outstanding on lead vocals, and I can't understand why she hasn't gotten a solo before this"; he gave it an [...] "A". Stack was slightly less generous with an [...] "A-", and wrote {{that it was a}} [...] "great song choice for Santana"; he gave [...] "bonus points for the phenomenal Mike/Brittany choreography", while Harper said that their dancing [...] "totally made the song". Nguyen liked the dancing, but she was critical of how the song sounded, as she felt [...] "it lacked something and didn't really feel worthy of the standing O", while Futterman said [...] "Santana's sassy vocals are a perfect echo of Winehouse's, {{but the rest of the}} song feels a bit like a circus". Reiter felt the entire song [...] "seemed kind of tacked on", both the dancing and Santana's solo.|$|E
500|$|Edrich and Bedser {{continued}} to amass runs after the break, and Lindwall appealed for lbw {{for the fourth}} time while Saggers remained silent. The pair brought up their century partnership as England scored 22 runs in the 30 minutes after lunch. Johnson <b>came</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> Edrich lofted him for six to reach 96. Edrich then hit a long hop from the part-time wrist spin of Arthur Morris for four to reach his century. Bedser joined the attack and lifted Morris high over square leg for six, and Bradman replaced him with Toshack, who bowled a maiden. O'Reilly said that during the partnership, only Lindwall appeared capable of threatening the batsmen. He said Lindwall [...] "kept slogging away, tirelessly retaining his pace and enthusiasm long after {{the other members of the}} attack had lost all signs of hostility…Bradman could not afford to spare him from doing much more than his share of the galley-slave work." [...] O'Reilly decried Lindwall's workload as excessive and potentially harmful to his longevity. However, against the run of play, Bedser was out caught and bowled by Johnson after almost three hours of batting, ending a 155-run stand for the third wicket. His on-drive was intercepted by the bowler, who dived across the pitch to his right-hand side to complete the catch. Bedser had struck eight fours and two sixes in a Test best of 79. He appeared upset by his dismissal, patting the ball back to the bowler when he could have hit it decisively. Edrich attempted to pull a Johnson long hop to the leg side, targeting the large gap between square leg and mid-on, but only ballooned the ball to Morris, who completed the catch diving forwards at wide mid-on. This came after only three runs after Bedser's dismissal and left the score at 426/4. Edrich had batted for 314 minutes in compiling 111, with 13 fours and a six.|$|E
