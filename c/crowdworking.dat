40|$|Whereas {{crowdsourcing}} as a topic {{has often}} been addressed in recent literature, web-based <b>crowdworking</b> platforms that manage the interface between crowdsourcers and crowdworkers have not received much attention so far. Furthermore, most of these platforms focus on either the management of external or internal crowds; platforms that handle both groups are rare. This paper investigates such a provider: the German company Across Systems. It uses a hybrid model, offering an individual “mini <b>crowdworking</b> platform” that enables the simultaneous government of external and internal crowds {{as well as a}} more traditional marketplace <b>crowdworking</b> platform (crossMarket) where supply and demand meet. Using a single-case study approach, the main contribution {{of this paper is to}} shed light on a model that has the potential to change the current <b>crowdworking</b> platform market. We show that managing both external and internal crowds on one platform can increase the acceptance, quality and speed of task completion...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{crowdsourcing}} {{has emerged as}} a new form of work organization. <b>Crowdworking</b> platforms as intermediaries between crowdsourcing companies and crowd workers have gained importance in this process. Currently, many of these platforms manage rather simple work systems. Using the case of the German Hamburger Hochbahn AG and the innovation platform Phantominds, this paper investigates measures necessary for <b>crowdworking</b> platforms to be able to manage also more complex work systems. To derive such measures, we analyze the work system of Hamburger Hochbahn and Phantominds, explore the interplay between the crowd and the platform provider and subsequently provide recommendations for companies that would like to use <b>crowdworking</b> platforms for the processing of work and for platform operators. With this paper, we extend current knowledge in the realms of IS, organizational theory, and platform ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Crowdsourcing {{has evolved}} into a {{powerful}} new instrument for companies. In the last years, <b>crowdworking</b> platforms that manage work systems as intermediaries between crowdsourcers and crowd workers have increasingly been used. Nevertheless, they currently often manage rather simple work systems. Although they have the potential for managing more complex ones, there is still little knowledge how this can be done and what measures are necessary to do so. To explore this question in more detail, we investigate three seminal projects that Deutsche Bank completed with the <b>crowdworking</b> platform Jovoto and that aimed at exploring AI trends and developing concepts for the future of banking. We derive measures necessary for the successful management of complex work systems and provide a model as guidance for both companies and <b>crowdworking</b> platform operators. With our findings, we extend current knowledge in the realm of IS, organizational theory, and platform ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|The {{new forms}} of {{provision}} of professional services made possible by scientific innovation and technological-digital advances are currently provoking, in contexts of collaborative economy, new labor relations that require a novel legal and political regulation within the discipline of Labor Law and Social Security. Or, where appropriate, to rethink the labor legal system and its central institutions {{for the sake of}} adaptation or modification for them. Disjunction to which the <b>crowdworking</b> has been paradigmatically. In this sense, taking into account their immediate causes and antecedents, the meaning and scope of the current model of the same and its protagonists -crowdworkers- that is being implemented in the most developed contemporary societies are identified, as well as a series of questions way of critical-constructive reflections on whether, with this new working relationship, what is really happening is a covert flight of labor law...|$|E
40|$|Designing {{effective}} incentives is {{a challenge}} across many social computing contexts, from attracting crowdworkers to sustaining online contributions. However, one aspect of incentivizing that has been understudied is its impact on participation bias, as different incentives may attract different subsets of the population to participate. In this paper, we present two empirical studies in the <b>crowdworking</b> context that show that the incentive offered influence who participates in the task. Using the Basic Human Values, we found that a lottery reward attracted participants who held stronger openness-to-change values while a charity reward attracted those with stronger self-transcendence orientation. Further, we found that participation self-selection resulted in differences in the task outcomes. Through attracting more self-directed individuals, the lottery reward resulted in more ideas generated in a brainstorming task. Design implications include utilizing rewards to target desired participants and using diverse incentives to improve participation diversity.

40|$|The paper {{highlights}} {{the development of}} IT and crowd working integrated in the lean enterprise. The aim {{of this paper is}} to identify the role of IT in “Lean” production systems and define crowd working evolution in order to advance an organizational model, focusing on digital crowd work in firms, which we define here as the performance of tasks online by distributed crowd workers who can have a work contract with the firm or not. This study reflects on some questions. What could be the definition of "working" or the activity on work of an individual? Can it be said that the approach to Lean Enterprise flexibility of organizational boundaries of enterprise also involves the entity that performs active action on the job? The research is carried out by analyzing the literature in depth and conducting exploratory investigation following a qualitative methodology. The literature analyzed and the forward-thinking of the authors reveals an integration model that highlights Lean Enterprise and <b>Crowdworking</b> innovative concept. Analyzing the crowd work where the interactions involve workers and voluntary workers, we can trace a new perspective in coherence with e-Lean Enterprise...|$|E
40|$|Digitalization, {{automation}} {{and increasing}} robotisation in health care, industry and beyond, {{coupled with the}} advent of platform-based competitive mediation of work (<b>crowdworking)</b> – all impact on the future of work and labour. The associated challenges to the labour market, working conditions, wages, and the blurring boundary between private and professional life are the topic of intensive political and societal debate in many countries. Just take the conflicts surrounding Uber and AirBnB and their entry to traditional markets, as well as the vision of the so-called Internet of Things or cyber-physical systems, as the most prominent issues. Technology assessment (TA) always tries to be at the forefront of such debates. It is therefore not surprising that the member institutions of the European Parliamentary Technology Assessment (EPTA) network have already devoted a number of projects on labour issues related to digitalisation. The Annual EPTA Conference 2016 “The future of labour in the digital era: Ubiquitous computing, virtual platforms and real-time production” was thus devoted to this timely and exciting topic. This report continues a series of similar reports compiled by the respective presidency of the EPTA network. As in previous years, it is a collection of contributions written from the perspectives of all full and associate members of EPTA. This report also includes a general introduction and a synthesis that gives the reader a compact summary of the state-of-the-art in the EPTA countries. The report was originally intended to inform the participants of the Annual EPTA Conference held in the Austrian Parliament in Vienna on 21 st October 2016. After the conference it has been amended to reflect the lively debates and to include the preliminary results of the conference debates.   Publisher: EPTA – European Parliamentary Technology Assessment Published: Vienna; November 2016 Editor: Michael Nentwich Authors of country report "Austria": Tanja Sinozic, Michael Nentwich, Walter Peissl, Georg Aichholzer & Johann Ča...|$|E
