5|$|In the United States, all Season One DVDs were encoded using NTSC. Since {{this is not}} {{compatible}} in {{most countries}} outside North America, Nickelodeon released separate DVDs in regions where the video would be encoded using PAL instead. These releases began on February 19, 2007; each DVD was released months after the original release. As with the original DVDs, each set contained five episodes on one disc, {{with the exception of}} The Complete Book One Collection Box Set, which contained all of the twenty episodes in the season on five discs. In the Netherlands, all episodes <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> box.|$|E
5|$|She then {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with Michelle McCool, later called LayCool. They began a feud with Mickie James in October, making a mockery of her weight and vowing to make her leave SmackDown. At the Survivor Series, McCool's team lost to James' team. At , Layla interfered in the WWE Women's Championship match between McCool and James by helping McCool retain the title. In January 2010, at Royal Rumble, Layla <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fatsuit, mocking James prior to the title match between McCool and James; however, the mockery backfired, as James attacked Layla and used that as a distraction to quickly defeat McCool to win the title. On the 12 February episode of SmackDown, Layla and McCool defeated James in a handicap match made by Official SmackDown Consultant Vickie Guerrero, who had been accidentally humiliated by James backstage. Guerrero then began managing LayCool, accompanying them to the ring and regularly interfering in their matches. At the Elimination Chamber, Layla and McCool defeated Raw's Gail Kim and Maryse in an inter-brand tag team match. At WrestleMania XXVI, Layla was on the winning team in an inter-brand tag team match.|$|E
5|$|The director's {{original}} cut of Sholay has {{a different}} ending in which Thakur kills Gabbar, along with some additional violent scenes. Gabbar's death scene, and the scene in which the imam's son is killed, were cut from the film by India's Censor Board, as was the scene in which Thakur's family is massacred. The Censor Board {{was concerned about the}} violence, and that viewers may be influenced to violate the law by punishing people severely. Although Sippy fought to keep the scenes, eventually he had to re-shoot the ending of the film, and as directed by the Censor Board, have the police arrive just before Thakur can kill Gabbar. The censored theatrical version was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years. The original, unedited cut of the film finally <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> British release on VHS in 1990. Since then, Eros International has released two versions on DVD. The director's cut of the film preserves the original full frame and is 204minutes in length; the censored widescreen version is 198minutes long.|$|E

25|$|A {{proposed}} third species, D. breedorum, {{was coined}} by Samuel Welles through Welles and Pickering (1999) for the specimen UCMP 77270 collected in 1964. Tykoski (2005) performed an ontogenetic analysis in his thesis {{and concluded that}} D. breedorum is an adult Dilophosaurus wetherilli. This was the first specimen of the genus to preserve a nearly complete cranial crest. Welles concluded that differences between the original specimens and UCMP 77270 justified the naming of separate species. He was unable to complete a manuscript describing this during his lifetime, and the name eventually <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> private publication distributed by Pickering. This species has not been accepted as valid in other reviews of the genus, which {{see it as a}} nomen nudum and/or a junior subjective synonym.|$|E
25|$|Already in Autumn 1948, {{criticism}} <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{joint statement}} by AB Atomenergi and Atom Commission. The FOA reports predicted a military monopoly over Swedish uranium {{resources to the}} detriment of civilian research, and that much larger resources were being assigned to plutonium production. The feasibility of the plutonium project was under question. That was the first sign of antagonism of interests between military and civilian nuclear proponents. The plans had been predicated on the idea that each nuclear device required 50kg rather than 6kg of plutonium. None of those involved in the project realized that this was, in fact, an overestimation. Although the program was scaled to produce 5-10 weapons per year, given the estimated production of 1kg of Pu-239 per day, it was actually scaled to produce sixty.|$|E

25|$|In 1790, William Kelly of Glasgow used a {{new method}} {{to assist the}} draw stroke. First animals, and then water, {{was used as the}} prime mover. Wright of Manchester moved the head stock to the centre of the machine, {{allowing}} twice as many spindles; a squaring band was added to ensure the spindles <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> straight line. He was in conversation with John Kennedy {{about the possibility of a}} self-acting mule. Kennedy, a partner in McConnell & Kennedy machine makers in Ancoats, was concerned with building ever larger mules. McConnell & Kennedy ventured into spinning when they were left with two unpaid-for mules; their firm prospered and eventually merged into the Fine Spinners & Doublers Association. In 1793, John Kennedy was addressing the problem of fine counts. With these counts, the spindles on the return traverse needed to rotate faster than on the outward traverse. He attached gears and a clutch to implement this motion.|$|E
500|$|Penn did {{not have}} a first down in the first half, as the Tech defense played well. Hill scored a {{touchdown}} in the third quarter on a 27-yard run through the line. Penn's only scoring opportunity was in the third quarter. After another Al Hill touchdown and the kickoff return, Penn worked five complete forward passes in quick succession (one 23 yards) to reach Tech's 6-yard line. The Tech defense responded, and Penn turned the ball over on downs. On first down, Carpenter threw Penn back for a 6-yard loss and a pass was incomplete on second down. On third down, Penn's quarterback dropped back to pass Carpenter and William Higgins tackled him on the 25-yard line. On fourth down, Penn <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> [...] "freak formation" [...] and its pass was incomplete. In the fourth quarter, Judy Harlan had a 65-yard interception return for a touchdown.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the book What Mad Universe (1949), Paul Di Filippo of Sci Fi Weekly posited that the book's author Fredric Brown may have been {{influenced}} by Hubbard's story. Umberto Rossi wrote in The Twisted Worlds of Philip K. Dick (2011) that writer Philip K. Dick was likely influenced by Typewriter in the Sky. Rossi noted Typewriter in the Sky <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> paperback format in 1951, and a year later Dick succeeded in getting his first short story, the tale [...] "Beyond Lies the Wub" [...] published. Rossi said Typewriter in the Sky was [...] "the text that admittedly inspired" [...] The Cosmic Puppets (1957) by Philip K. Dick. In the book Harlan Ellison's Watching (1989), by Harlan Ellison, Typewriter in the Sky is compared to Purple Rose of Cairo, [...] "I bet if L. Ron Hubbard had written Purple Rose of Cairo they'd have given it a Hugo ... I mean, it is sort of a hip, updated version of Typewriter in the Sky." [...] Gary Westfahl quoted Hubbard's work in a book of noteworthy science fiction quotations, Science Fiction Quotations: From the Inner Mind to the Outer Limits (2005).|$|E

Each dancer threw one chair up to the top, with Usher already in hand with his own chair, with everyone following a set dance routine. Following this, Usher performed [...] "U Remind Me", where he danced by himself during a breakdown of the track. He then sang [...] "That's What It's Made For", following on with the song [...] "Bad Girl", where Usher was dressed up in a lavender suit and <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chrome chair.

It <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 1959 French edition, as Les Visages de France, with a preface by Roger Garaudy. Ralea {{was also one}} of the select few Romanians, most of them trusted figures of the regime, who could reissue selections from their interwar literary contributions, at the specialized state company Editura de Stat pentru Literatură și Artă. Ralea was one of the first in this series, with the 1957 Scrieri din trecut ("Writings from the Past). Under a similar understanding with the regime, Ralea and other dignitaries could publish accounts of their travels in capitalist countries—in Ralea's case, the 1959 În extremul occident ("Into the Far West"). It had comments on the [...] "iron fisted rule" [...] of the United Fruit, and gibes at [...] "the putrefied lazy specimens" [...] of [...] "exploiters" [...] in pre-communist Cuba. Ralea was nevertheless active in reintegrating culturally some intellectuals who had been imprisoned and rehabilitated: together with one such figure, Constantin I. Botez, he wrote the 1958 Istoria psihologiei ("History of Psychology").|$|E
