40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to find rubber compound adhesive formula for preparing leather shoes of direct vulcanizing process. Leather shoes manufactured by vulcanizing process need a suitable rubber compound adhesive for joining the leather uppers and unvulcanized rubber compound soles. The amount of tackifier in rubber compound adhesive influence the adhesive bonding strength. In preparing the adhesive formula, the effect of <b>coumarone</b> <b>resin</b> addition as tackifier were varies in the mount of 5, 10 and 15 phr respectively. Rubber compound adhesive was produced by two roll mill machine, after that compound were dissolved in wash benzene with ratio 1 : 10. The prepared adhesive then was applied to manufacture leather shoes using vulcanization moulding at temperature 1700 C and 150 kg/cm 2 pressure for 8 minutes. The best adhesive formula could be as the following : natural rubber 100 phr, calcium silicate 5 phr, <b>coumarone</b> <b>resin</b> 10 phr, zinc oxide 10 phr, stearic acid 2 phr, AOSP 2 phr, MBTS 0, 8 phr; TMTD 0, 2 phr and sulphur 2 phr. The best formula had the peeling strength of the outsole 65, 25 kg, peeling strength of the insole 1553 g/cm, and could meet the requirements of JIS 5050, 1984 for Leather shoes. Viscosity of the formula was 2250 cp. ...|$|E

It makes from natural rubber (pale crepe) and synthetic rubber (SBR 1502) as material with addition ingredients are china clay, stearic, guanidine, naphthenic oil, paraffin wax, <b>coumarone</b> <b>resin,</b> zink okside, stearic acid, guanidine, sulfonamide, ASOP, titan diokside, brown factice and sulphur. Rubber compound for refrigerator gasket, formed to slab by hydraulic press at 150 C and 150 kg/cm 2. Than tasted hardness and tear resistant. The result of {{this research}} indicated naphthenic oil and filler china clay variation are high significant to hardness and tear resistant properties of rubber compound for refrigerator gasket...|$|E
