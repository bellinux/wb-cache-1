5|$|<b>Cnidaria</b> {{that carry}} {{photosynthetic}} symbionts {{may have the}} opposite problem, an excess of oxygen, which may prove toxic. The animals produce large quantities of antioxidants to neutralize the excess oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic infestations, stings, and bites {{in humans}} {{are caused by}} several groups of organisms {{belonging}} to the following phyla: Annelida, Arthropoda, Bryozoa, Chordata, <b>Cnidaria,</b> Cyanobacteria, Echinodermata, Nemathelminthes, Platyhelminthes, and Protozoa.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones, order Actiniaria, are {{classified}} in the phylum <b>Cnidaria,</b> class Anthozoa, subclass Hexacorallia. Rodriguez et al. proposed a new classification for the Actiniaria based on extensive DNA results.|$|E
5|$|Corals are marine {{invertebrates}} {{in the class}} Anthozoa of phylum <b>Cnidaria.</b> They typically live in compact colonies of many identical individual polyps. The group includes the important reef builders that inhabit tropical oceans and secrete calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton.|$|E
5|$|All known <b>cnidaria</b> can {{reproduce}} asexually {{by various}} means, {{in addition to}} regenerating after being fragmented. Hydrozoan polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. Scyphozoan polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition to both of these methods, Anthozoa can split horizontally just above the base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter cnidarian a clone of the adult.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians feed {{in several}} ways: predation, {{absorbing}} dissolved organic chemicals, filtering food particles {{out of the}} water, obtaining nutrients from symbiotic algae within their cells, and parasitism. Most obtain {{the majority of their}} food from predation but some, including the corals Hetroxenia and Leptogorgia, depend almost completely on their endosymbionts and on absorbing dissolved nutrients. <b>Cnidaria</b> give their symbiotic algae carbon dioxide, some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.|$|E
5|$|Le Règne Animal (The Animal Kingdom) is {{the most}} famous work of the French naturalist Georges Cuvier. It sets out to {{describe}} the natural structure of {{the whole of the}} animal kingdom based on comparative anatomy, and its natural history. Cuvier divided the animals into four embranchements ("Branches", roughly corresponding to phyla), namely vertebrates, molluscs, articulated animals (arthropods and annelids), and zoophytes (<b>cnidaria</b> and other phyla).|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa is {{included}} within the phylum <b>Cnidaria,</b> {{which also includes}} the jellyfish, box jellies and parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa. The two main subclasses of Anthozoa are the Hexacorallia, members of which have six-fold symmetry and includes the stony corals, sea anemones, tube anemones and zoanthids; and the Octocorallia, which have eight-fold symmetry and includes the soft corals and gorgonians (sea pens, sea fans and sea whips), and sea pansies. The smaller subclass, Ceriantharia, consists of the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E
5|$|Corals are {{classified}} in the class Anthozoa of the phylum <b>Cnidaria.</b> They are divided into three subclasses, Hexacorallia, Octocorallia, and Ceriantharia. The Hexacorallia include the stony corals, the sea anemones and the zoanthids. These groups have polyps that generally have 6-fold symmetry. The Octocorallia include blue coral, soft corals, sea pens, and gorgonians (sea fans and sea whips). These groups have polyps with 8-fold symmetry, each polyp having eight tentacles and eight mesenteries. Ceriantharia are the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E
5|$|Discs : Circular fossils, such as Ediacaria, Cyclomedusa and Rugoconites led to {{the initial}} {{identification}} of Ediacaran fossils as <b>cnidaria,</b> which include jellyfish and corals. Further examination has provided alternative interpretations of all disc-shaped fossils: not one is now confidently recognised as a jellyfish. Alternate explanations include holdfasts and protists; the patterns displayed where two meet have led to many 'individuals' being identified as microbial colonies, and yet others may represent scratch marks formed as stalked organisms spun around their holdfasts. Useful diagnostic characters are often lacking because only {{the underside of the}} organism is preserved by fossilisation.|$|E
5|$|In evolution, luciferins {{generally}} vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is {{the light}} emitting pigment for nine ancient phyla (groups of very different organisms), including polycystine radiolaria, Cercozoa (Phaeodaria), protozoa, comb jellies, <b>cnidaria</b> including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and vertebrates (ray-finned fish). Not all these organisms synthesize coelenterazine: {{some of them}} obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferase enzymes vary widely and tend to be different in each species. Overall, bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} of ctenophores {{to the rest}} of Metazoa is very important {{to our understanding of the}} early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity. It has been the focus of debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the <b>Cnidaria,</b> sister to <b>Cnidaria,</b> Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animals. A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to <b>Cnidaria,</b> Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera and Placozoa) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal taxon instead. As such, the Ctenophora appear to be a basal diploblast clade. In agreement with the latter point, the analysis of a very large sequence alignment at the metazoan taxonomic scale (1,719 proteins totalizing ca. 400,000 amino acid positions) showed that ctenophores emerge as the second-earliest branching animal lineage, and sponges are sister-group to all other multicellular animals. Another study strongly rejects the hypothesis that sponges are the sister group to all other extant animals and establishes the placement of Ctenophora as the sister group to all other animals, and disagreement with the last-mentioned paper is explained by methodological problems in analyses in that work.|$|E
5|$|Spawning is {{generally}} driven by environmental {{factors such as}} changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the phase of the moon. Many species of <b>Cnidaria</b> may spawn simultaneously in the same location, {{so that there are}} too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage— one famous example is the Great Barrier Reef, where at least 110 corals and a few non-cnidarian invertebrates produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce hybrids, some of which can settle and form polyps, but it is not known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cnidaria,</b> {{which are}} an outgroup to the taxa {{mentioned}} above, express c-opsins – but r-opsins {{are yet to}} be found in this group. Incidentally, the melanin produced in the <b>cnidaria</b> is produced in the same fashion as that in vertebrates, suggesting the common descent of this pigment.|$|E
25|$|Some colonial <b>Cnidaria</b> {{develop as}} stolons with {{interconnected}} medusoid structures that later separate.|$|E
25|$|The Myxozoa, {{microscopic}} parasites {{that were}} originally considered Protozoa, are now {{believed to have}} evolved within <b>Cnidaria.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ctenophores (comb jellies) are a {{separate}} phylum from <b>Cnidaria.</b> Their method of propulsion is coordinated movement {{of thousands of}} cilia used as paddles, rather than a pulsating bell, although a few species of ctenophores swim by flapping large lobes.|$|E
25|$|Corals are {{animals in}} the Phylum <b>Cnidaria</b> and the class Anthozoa. Anthozoa is broken down into two subclasses Octocorals (Alcyonaria) and Hexacorals (Zoantharia). Octocorals are soft corals such as sea pens. Hexacorals include sea anemones and hard bodied corals. Octocorals contain eight body {{extensions}} while Hexacorals have six. Most deep-water corals are stony corals.|$|E
25|$|Hydra is a genus of {{freshwater}} polyp in the phylum <b>Cnidaria</b> with highly proliferative stem cells {{that gives them}} the ability to regenerate their entire body. Any fragment larger than a few hundred epithelial cells that is isolated from the body {{has the ability to}} regenerate into a smaller version of itself. The high proportion of stem cells in the hydra supports its efficient regenerative ability.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of nervous systems {{dates back to}} the first development of nervous systems in animals (or metazoans). Neurons developed as specialized electrical signaling cells in multicellular animals, adapting the mechanism of action potentials present in motile single-celled and colonial eukaryotes. Simple nerve nets seen in animals like <b>cnidaria</b> evolved first, followed by nerve cords in bilateral animals – ventral nerve cords in invertebrates and dorsal nerve cords supported by a notochord in chordates. Bilateralization led to the {{evolution of}} brains, a process called cephalization.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the other}} phyla, the Ctenophora and the <b>Cnidaria,</b> which {{includes}} sea anemones, corals, and jellyfish, are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers {{with a single}} opening, which serves as both the mouth and the anus. Both have distinct tissues, {{but they are not}} organized into organs. There are only two main germ layers, the ectoderm and endoderm, with only scattered cells between them. As such, these animals are sometimes called diploblastic. The tiny placozoans are similar, but {{they do not have a}} permanent digestive chamber.|$|E
25|$|The marine {{invertebrate}} collection {{is composed of}} specimens from taxa other than crustaceans and molluscs. It includes Annelida, Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Cestoda, Cephalochordata, Hemichordata, <b>Cnidaria,</b> Ctenophora, Echinodermata, Echiura, Entoprocta, Nematoda, Foraminifera, Phoronida, Rotifera, Turbellaria, Trematoda, Urochordata, Porifera, Priapulida and Sipuncula. Specimens are mostly marine (Western Atlantic and Antarctic Ocean), but some are neotropical freshwater and terrestrial. Containing nearly 200,000 lots and 200 type specimens, the collection was built with the efforts of late-19th-century researchers including Ernst and Eveline Marcus, Gilberto Righi, Luis Roberto Tommasi, Antonio Sérgio Ferreira Ditadi, Jeanete Maron Ramos, Gertrude Rita Kloss and Sérgio de Almeida Rodrigues.|$|E
25|$|The polyp is {{generally}} a small stalk with a mouth that is ringed by upward-facing tentacles. The polyps resemble the closely related <b>Cnidaria</b> anthozoan (sea anemones and corals) polyps. The jellyfish polyp may be sessile, {{living on the}} bottom or on another substrate such as floats or boat hulls, {{or it may be}} free-floating or attached to tiny bits of free-living plankton or rarely, fish or other invertebrates. Polyps may be solitary or colonial. Polyp colonies form by strobilation, in which multiple polyps share a common stomach cavity. Most polyps are only millimeters in size. They feed continuously. The polyp stage may last for years.|$|E
25|$|Hydras are a genus of the <b>Cnidaria</b> phylum. All cnidarians can regenerate, {{allowing}} them to recover from injury and to reproduce asexually. Hydras are simple, freshwater animals possessing radial symmetry and no post-mitotic cells. All hydra cells continually divide. It {{has been suggested that}} hydras do not undergo senescence, and, as such, are biologically immortal. In a four-year study, 3 cohorts of hydra did not show an increase in mortality with age. It is possible that these animals live much longer, considering that they reach maturity in 5 to 10 days. However, this does not explain how hydras are consequently able to maintain telomere lengths.|$|E
25|$|Several other {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} domesticated, both terrestrial and aquatic, including {{some such as}} Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies and the freshwater cnidarian Hydra for research into genetics and physiology. Few {{have a long history}} of domestication. Most are used for food or other products such as shellac and cochineal. The phyla involved are <b>Cnidaria,</b> Platyhelminthes (for biological control), Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda (marine crustaceans as well as insects and spiders), and Echinodermata. While many marine molluscs are used for food, only a few have been domesticated, including squid, cuttlefish and octopus, all used in research on behaviour and neurology. Terrestrial snails in the genera Helix and Murex are raised for food. Several parasitic or parasitoidal insects including the fly Eucelatoria, the beetle Chrysolina, and the wasp Aphytis are raised for biological control. Conscious or unconscious artificial selection has many effects on species under domestication; variability can readily be lost by inbreeding, selection against undesired traits, or genetic drift, while in Drosophila, variability in eclosion time (when adults emerge) has increased.|$|E
25|$|A huge {{variety of}} marine {{invertebrates}} {{are found in}} Australian waters, with the Great Barrier Reef {{an important source of}} this diversity. Families include the Porifera or sea sponges, the <b>Cnidaria</b> (includes the jellyfish, corals and sea anemones, comb jellies), the Echinodermata (includes the sea urchins, sea stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, the lamp shells) and the Mollusca (includes snails, slugs, limpets, squid, octopus, cockles, oysters, clams, and chitons). Venomous invertebrates include the box jellyfish, the blue-ringed octopus, and ten species of cone snail, which can cause respiratory failure and death in humans. The crown-of-thorns starfish usually inhabits the Reef at low densities. However, under conditions that are not yet well understood, they can reproduce to reach an unsustainable population density when coral is devoured at a rate faster than it can regenerate. This presents a serious reef management issue. Other problematic marine invertebrates include the native species purple sea urchin and the white urchin, which have been able to take over marine habitats and form urchin barrens due to the over harvesting of their natural predators which include abalone and rock lobster. Introduced invertebrate pests include the Asian mussel, New Zealand green-lipped mussel, black-striped mussel and the Northern Pacific seastar, all of which displace native shellfish.|$|E
500|$|It is now {{generally}} {{thought that}} the Calcarea (sponges with calcium carbonate spicules) are {{more closely related to}} <b>Cnidaria,</b> Ctenophora (comb jellies) and Bilateria (all the more complex animals) than they are to the other groups of sponges. In 1866 it was proposed that <b>Cnidaria</b> and Ctenophora were more closely related to each other than to Bilateria and formed a group called Coelenterata ("hollow guts"), because <b>Cnidaria</b> and Ctenophora both rely on the flow of water {{in and out of a}} single cavity for feeding, excretion and respiration. In 1881, it was proposed that Ctenophora and Bilateria were more closely related to each other, since they shared features that <b>Cnidaria</b> lack, for example muscles in the middle layer (mesoglea in Ctenophora, mesoderm in Bilateria). However more recent analyses indicate that these similarities are rather vague, and the current view, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that <b>Cnidaria</b> and Bilateria are more closely related to each other than either is to Ctenophora. This grouping of <b>Cnidaria</b> and Bilateria has been labelled [...] "Planulozoa" [...] because it suggests that the earliest Bilateria were similar to the planula larvae of <b>Cnidaria.</b>|$|E

500|$|Today, the myxozoans, {{previously}} {{thought to be}} multicellular protozoans, are considered animals by most scientists, though their status has not officially changed. [...] Recent molecular studies suggest they are related to Bilateria or <b>Cnidaria,</b> with <b>Cnidaria</b> being closer morphologically because both groups have extrusive filaments,.

500|$|Sea anemones are a {{group of}} marine, predatory animals of the order Actiniaria. They are named after the anemone, a {{terrestrial}} flowering plant, because of the colourful appearance of many. Sea anemones are classified in the phylum <b>Cnidaria,</b> class Anthozoa, subclass Hexacorallia. [...] As cnidarians, sea anemones are related to corals, jellyfish, tube-dwelling anemones, and Hydra. Unlike jellyfish, sea anemones {{do not have a}} medusa stage in their life cycle.|$|E
500|$|It is {{difficult}} to reconstruct the early stages in the evolutionary [...] "family tree" [...] of animals using only morphology (their shapes and structures), because the large differences between Porifera (sponges), <b>Cnidaria</b> plus Ctenophora (comb jellies), Placozoa and Bilateria (all the more complex animals) make comparisons difficult. Hence reconstructions now rely largely or entirely on molecular phylogenetics, which groups organisms according to similarities and differences in their biochemistry, usually in their DNA or RNA.|$|E
500|$|<b>Cnidaria</b> are diploblastic animals; {{in other}} words, {{they have two}} main cell layers, while more complex animals are triploblasts having three main layers.
