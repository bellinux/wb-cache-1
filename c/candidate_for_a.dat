5|$|For {{reasons that}} remain obscure, the planet's {{thermosphere}} {{is at an}} anomalously high temperature of about 750K. The planet is {{too far from the}} Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} certain mallards appear {{to be closer to}} their Indo-Pacific relatives while others are related to their American relatives. Mitochondrial DNA data for the D-loop sequence suggests that mallards may have evolved in the general area of Siberia. Mallard bones rather abruptly appear in food remains of ancient humans and other deposits of fossil bones in Europe, without a good <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> local predecessor species. The large ice age palaeosubspecies that made up at least the European and west Asian populations during the Pleistocene has been named Anas platyrhynchos palaeoboschas.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} of 1796 {{was the first}} contested American presidential election. Twice, George Washington had been elected to office unanimously; however, during his presidency, deep philosophical {{differences between the two}} leading figures in the administration – Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson – regarding domestic economic policy and U.S. foreign policy caused a rift between them, and led to the founding of the Federalist Party and the Democratic-Republican Party. Thus, when Washington announced {{that he would not be}} a <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> third term, an intense partisan struggle for control of Congress and the presidency began.|$|E
5|$|The {{move was}} panned in the state's newspapers, and by {{prominent}} citizens such as future governor James Turner Morehead. Yet Slaughter {{followed up with}} another unpopular decision, appointing Martin D. Hardin, {{a member of the}} hated Federalist Party, to fill the Senate seat of William T. Barry. Despite this, the General Assembly made the appointment permanent when it convened in December 1816. However, the administration <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> full senatorial term, John Adair was defeated in the General Assembly, which opted for John J. Crittenden.|$|E
5|$|These {{features}} make Archaeopteryx a clear <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> transitional fossil between non-avian {{dinosaurs and}} birds. Thus, Archaeopteryx {{plays an important}} role, {{not only in the}} study of the origin of birds, but in the study of dinosaurs. It was named from a single feather in 1861. That same year, the first complete specimen of Archaeopteryx was announced. Over the years, ten more fossils of Archaeopteryx have surfaced. Despite variation among these fossils, most experts regard all the remains that have been discovered as belonging to a single species, although this is still debated.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin {{became a}} monk in about 1170, and then abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Forde. He {{was well known}} as a canonist, and often acted as a judge-delegate for the papacy, hearing cases that had reached the Roman Curia and been remanded to local experts for decision. In 1166, Baldwin was the {{addressee}} of a work by John of Salisbury, Expectiatione longa, {{which was one of}} the tracts written during the Becket controversy. It was probably at this time that Baldwin wrote De sacramento altaris. In 1175 he served with his old bishop, Bartholomew, as joint papal judge in a dispute between Malmesbury Abbey and Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury. In 1178 he was recommended to Pope Alexander as a possible <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cardinalship, but this never occurred.|$|E
5|$|Blythburgh, a {{mile from}} Bulcamp and {{situated}} near the fordable headwaters of the Blyth estuary, was afterwards {{believed to be the}} location of the tombs of Anna and Jurmin. It is a <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> monastic site or a royal regio (estate). According to Peter Warner, the Latin derivation of part of the nearby place-name 'Bulcamp' indicates its ancient origins, and mediaeval sources which claim continuous Christian worship at Blythburgh throughout the Anglo-Saxon period provide circumstantial evidence of its connections with East Anglian royalty and Christianity. Part of an 8th-century whalebone diptych or writing-tablet, used for liturgical purposes, has been found near the site.|$|E

Among other accolades include two Satellite Awards nominations in two categories, two TCA Award nominations in two categories, and one Empire Award nomination. At the 6th Critics' Choice Television Awards, Fargo won four awards from eight nominations, the majority of which acknowledged the performance work of the show's cast.|$|E
5|$|First {{observed}} in September 2006, the supernova SN 2006gy, which {{occurred in a}} galaxy called NGC 1260 (240 million light-years away), is the largest and, until confirmation of luminosity of SN 2005ap in October 2007, the most luminous supernova ever observed. The explosion was at least 100 times more luminous than any previously observed supernova, with the progenitor star being estimated 150 times more massive than the Sun. Although this had some characteristics of a Type Ia supernova, Hydrogen {{was found in the}} spectrum. It is thought that SN 2006gy is a likely <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pair-instability supernova. SN 2005ap, which was discovered by Robert Quimby who also discovered SN 2006gy, was about twice as bright as SN 2006gy and about 300 times as bright as a normal type II supernova.|$|E

In 1890, he served as {{the vice president of the}} West Virginia Bar Association from West Virginia's 2nd congressional district. By 1907, he was president of the Mineral County Bar Association, and in 1909 he served on the bar association's Committee on Legal Education.

5|$|In 1902, James Baker {{died at the}} age of 41, {{leaving an}} opening in the GCC. On this {{occasion}} Watts Morgan was permitted to advance as a Labour candidate and was returned unopposed. By 1903 he was being talked of as a possible <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> south Wales parliamentary constituency. He joined the South Wales Miners' Federation at its inception and by 1902 he was pushing for a greater political role for the organisation. By 1908 the Federation was making great headway in the Rhondda and was substantially improving conditions for the miners. At this time Watts Morgan was Agent and District Secretary at No.1 Rhondda District under William Abraham.|$|E
5|$|In public, Hand {{discussed}} {{issues of}} democracy, free speech, and toleration only in general terms. This discretion, plus {{a series of}} impressive speaking engagements, won him the respect of legal scholars and journalists, and by 1930 he {{was viewed as a}} serious <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> seat on the Supreme Court. His friend Felix Frankfurter, then a Harvard Law School professor, was among those lobbying hard for Hand's appointment. President Herbert Hoover chose to bypass him, possibly for political reasons, and appointed Charles Evans Hughes, who had previously served on the Court for six years before resigning to become the Republican candidate for President in 1916, as Chief Justice. With Hughes and another New Yorker, Harlan Fiske Stone, on the Court, the promotion of a third New Yorker was then seen as impossible.|$|E
5|$|It {{lived in}} what is now {{southern}} Germany in the Late Jurassic period around 150million years ago, when Europe was an archipelago in a shallow warm tropical sea, much closer to the equator than it is now. Similar in shape to a European magpie, with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a raven, Archaeopteryx could grow to about 0.5metres (1.6ft) in length. Despite its small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, Archaeopteryx has more in common with other small Mesozoic dinosaurs than it does with modern birds. In particular, it shares the following features with the deinonychosaurs (dromaeosaurs and troodontids): jaws with sharp teeth, three fingers with claws, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes ("killing claw"), feathers (which suggest homeothermy), and various skeletal features. These features make Archaeopteryx a clear <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> transitional fossil between dinosaurs and birds, making it important in the study both of dinosaurs and of the origin of birds.|$|E
