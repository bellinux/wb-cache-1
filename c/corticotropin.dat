25|$|A {{new model}} has {{recently}} {{surfaced in the}} literature regarding the HPA axis (structures in the brain that get activated in response to stress) and its involvement with dysthymia (e.g. phenotypic variations of <b>corticotropin</b> releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), and down-regulation of adrenal functioning) as well as forebrain serotonergic mechanisms. Since this model is highly provisional, further research is still needed.|$|E
25|$|Addison’s {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{that affects the}} adrenal cortex such that it is unable to efficiently secrete hormones. The immune system specifically targets {{the cells of the}} adrenal cortex and destroys them, but Addison’s disease can also be caused by a severe infection such as tuberculosis. Some symptoms include hypoglycemia and decreased blood sodium levels and increased blood potassium levels caused by a deficiency of aldosterone. These electrolyte imbalances induce nerve and muscle issues. Other symptoms include fatigue, salt cravings, weight loss, and increased skin pigmentation. Increased skin pigmentation is caused by a deficiency of the adrenocortical hormone hydrocortisone. Its normal behavior would be as negative feedback at the pituitary gland, stimulating the pituitary gland to decrease secretion of <b>corticotropin.</b> Because hydrocortisone is not able to be produced in Addison’s disease, the pituitary gland continues to secrete <b>corticotropin</b> which binds to the receptor for melanocyte-stimulating hormone. It then causes melanocytes to produce more pigment, thus darkening the skin tone.|$|E
25|$|Cushing's disease refers only to hypercortisolism {{secondary}} to excess production of ACTH from a corticotroph pituitary adenoma (secondary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism) or due to excess production of hypothalamus CRH (<b>Corticotropin</b> releasing hormone) (tertiary hypercortisolism/hypercorticism). This causes the blood ACTH levels {{to be elevated}} along with cortisol from the adrenal gland. The ACTH levels remain high because the tumor is unresponsive to negative feedback from high cortisol levels.|$|E
25|$|Classic 21-hydroxylase {{deficiency}} typically causes 17α-hydroxyprogesterone {{blood levels}} >242 nmol/L. (For comparison, a full-term infant at {{three days of}} age should have <3 nmol/L. Many neonatal screening programs have specific reference ranges by weight and gestational age because high levels {{may be seen in}} premature infants without CAH.) Salt-wasting patients tend to have higher 17α-hydroxyprogesterone levels than non-salt-wasting patients. In mild cases, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone may not be elevated in a particular random blood sample, but it will rise during a <b>corticotropin</b> stimulation test.|$|E
500|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{consists of two}} parts, the anterior (front) and posterior (back) pituitary. Both parts release hormones that control numerous other organs. In pituitary apoplexy, the main initial problem {{is a lack of}} secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, <b>corticotropin),</b> which stimulates the secretion of cortisol by the adrenal gland. This occurs in 70% of those with pituitary apoplexy. A sudden lack of cortisol in the body leads to a constellation of symptoms called [...] "adrenal crisis" [...] or [...] "Addisonian crisis" [...] (after a complication of Addison's disease, the main cause of adrenal dysfunction and low cortisol levels). The main problems are low blood pressure (particularly on standing), low blood sugars (which can lead to coma) and abdominal pain; the low blood pressure can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention.|$|E

50|$|Emicerfont (GW-876,008) {{is a drug}} {{developed}} by GlaxoSmithKline which acts as a CRF-1 antagonist. <b>Corticotropin</b> releasing factor (CRF), also known as <b>Corticotropin</b> releasing hormone, is an endogenous peptide hormone which is released in response to various triggers such as chronic stress, and activates the two corticotropin-releasing hormone receptors: CRF1 and CRF2. This then triggers the release of <b>corticotropin</b> (ACTH), another hormone which {{is involved in the}} physiological response to stress.|$|E
50|$|Both <b>corticotropin</b> and {{tetracosactide}} {{have been}} used for diagnostic purposes to determine adrenocortical insufficiency, particularly in Addison's disease, via the ACTH stimulation test.

50|$|Once Cushing's {{syndrome}} {{has been}} diagnosed, {{the first step}} towards finding the cause is measuring plasma <b>corticotropin</b> concentrations. A concentration consistently below 1.1 pmol/L is classified as corticotropin-independent and {{does not lead to}} a diagnosis of Cushing's disease. In such cases, the next step is adrenal imaging with CT. If plasma <b>corticotropin</b> concentrations are consistently above 3.3 pmol/L, then corticotropin-dependent Cushing's syndrome is most likely. Any intermediate values need to be cautiously interpreted and a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) test is advised in order to confirm <b>corticotropin</b> dependency. If corticotropin-dependent Cushing's syndrome is determined then {{the next step is to}} distinguish between Cushing's disease and ectopic <b>corticotropin</b> syndrome. This is done via a combination of techniques including CRH, high-dose DST, BIPSS, and pituitary MRI.|$|E

50|$|Administration of <b>corticotropin</b> {{releasing}} hormone (CRH) can differentiate this condition from ectopic ACTH secretion. In {{a patient with}} Cushing's disease, the tumor cells will be stimulated to release <b>corticotropin</b> and elevated plasma <b>corticotropin</b> levels will be detected. This rarely occurs with ectopic <b>corticotropin</b> syndrome and thus is quite useful for distinguishing between the two conditions. If ectopic, the plasma ACTH and cortisol levels should remain unchanged; if this is pituitary related, levels of both would rise. The CRH test uses recombinant human or bovine-sequence CRH, which is administered via a 100μg intravenous bolus dose. The sensitivity of the CRH test for detecting Cushing's disease is 93% when plasma levels are measured after fifteen and thirty minutes. However, this test is used {{only as a last}} resort due to its high cost and complexity.|$|E
