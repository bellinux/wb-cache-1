2500|$|The {{book has}} been {{classified}} as a postmodern, metafictional novel. The first chapter of Slaughterhouse-Five is written {{in the style of}} an author's preface about how he came to write the novel. The Narrator begins the novel by telling of his connection to the Dresden bombing, and why he is recording it. He gives a description of himself, and the book, saying that it is a desperate attempt at scholarly work. He segues to the story of Billy Pilgrim: [...] "Listen: Billy Pilgrim has <b>come</b> <b>unstuck</b> in time," [...] thus the transition from the writer's perspective to that of the third-person, omniscient Narrator. (The use of [...] "Listen" [...] as an opening interjection mimics the epic poem Beowulf.) The Narrator introduces Slaughterhouse-Five with the novel's genesis and ends the first chapter by discussing {{the beginning and the end}} of the novel. The fictional [...] "story" [...] appears to begin in chapter two, although there is no reason to presume that the first chapter is not fiction. This technique is common to postmodern meta-fiction. The story purports to be a disjointed narrative, from Billy Pilgrim's point of view, of being unstuck in time. Vonnegut's writing usually contains such disorder. He apologizes for the novel being [...] "so short and jumbled and jangled," [...] but says [...] "there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre." ...|$|E

And more importantly, will she divorce him to enable him to marry again?" [...] Despite his connection with the church, in September 2009 Lucas attempts to cover up his involvement in Trina's death.

When the show's executive producer Diederick Santer was asked by Digital Spy what was lined up for Lucas in 2010, he said [...] "He's got right on his side, hasn't he? Is the world a better place without Trina? Probably, yes. Is the world a better place without Owen? Well, I don't know about that, but he's not a particularly nice person...
