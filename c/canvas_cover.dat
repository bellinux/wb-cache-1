5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{refitted}} in early 1940 {{and a number}} of minor changes were made. The necessary improvements identified for the main armament during their sea trials a year earlier were finally implemented, the <b>canvas</b> <b>cover</b> for the back of the turrets was replaced by a rolling door, new radios were installed, and shields were fitted to the anti-aircraft machine guns and the searchlights. A SS-6 sonar was fitted in June 1940, but proved to be ineffectual.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes {{sent the}} first {{shipments}} of rifles up to Bechuanaland in January and February 1889, sending 250 each month, and instructed Jameson, Dr Frederick Rutherfoord Harris and a Shoshong trader, George Musson, to convey them to Bulawayo. Lobengula {{had so far}} accepted the financial payments described in the Rudd Concession (and continued {{to do so for}} years afterwards), but when the guns arrived in early April, he refused to take them. Jameson placed the weapons under a <b>canvas</b> <b>cover</b> in Maguire's camp, stayed at the kraal for ten days, and then went back south with Maguire in tow, leaving the rifles behind. A few weeks later, Lobengula dictated a letter for Fairbairn to write to the Queen—he said he had never intended to sign away mineral rights and that he and his izinDuna revoked their recognition of the document.|$|E
25|$|The Prairie Schooner was {{a second}} motor home built by Weston. It had a {{removable}} living area with a <b>canvas</b> <b>cover</b> and was water-proofed for river crossings. In 1931 - 1932, Weston travelled from Cape Agulhas, the southernmost point of Africa, to Belgrade, Bulgaria (and to England and back). Weston used the Prairie Schooner {{for the remainder of}} his life. In 1975, the Prairie Schooner featured in the International Veteran and Vintage Car Rally from Durban to Cape Town. It was later donated to the Winterton Museum, KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, by Weston’s son in law, Carl Rein Weston.|$|E

25|$|Skiffs {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being able to carry loads and are stable enough to allow occupants to stand up and move about while on the water. Skiffing is therefore an ideal introduction to rowing and river sports. Skiffing provides an opportunity for both short and extended recreational outings on the Thames and other waterways in Britain. The Thames meander {{is an example of a}} long distance skiff journey. For more leisurely progress, a camping skiff has an easily erectable <b>canvas</b> <b>cover</b> and is used for outdoor recreational activity holidays. The Thames Traditional Boat Society is particularly active in supporting recreational use of traditional boats like skiffs. Skiffs regularly take part in traditional boat events, in particular the Great River Race in London.|$|E
500|$|The {{fuselage}} had an oval cross-section and {{housed a}} water-cooled inverted V-12 engine. The cockpit was {{protected from the}} engine by a firewall ahead of the wing center section where the fuel tanks were located. At {{the rear of the}} cockpit, the bulkhead was covered by a <b>canvas</b> <b>cover</b> which could be breached by the crew in an emergency, enabling them to escape into the main fuselage. The canopy was split into two sections and joined by a strong welded steel frame. The canopy itself was made of Plexiglas and each compartment had its own [...] "sliding hood" [...] for the two crew members.|$|E
2500|$|B-26F—Angle-of-incidence {{of wings}} {{increased}} by 3.5º; fixed [...]50 caliber machine gun in nose removed; tail turret and associated armor improved. The first B-26F {{was produced in}} February 1944. One hundred of these were B-26F-1-MAs. Starting with 42-96231, a revised oil cooler was added, along with wing bottom panels redesigned for easier removal. A total of 200 of the 300 aircraft were B-26F-2s and F-6s, {{all of which were}} used by the RAF and SAAF as the Marauder Mk III. [...] The F-2 had the Bell M-6 power turret replaced by an M-6A with a flexible <b>canvas</b> <b>cover</b> over the guns. The T-1 bombsight was installed instead of the M-series sight. British bomb fusing and radio equipment were provided. (300 built) ...|$|E

The tail was of steel construction, <b>canvas</b> <b>covered.</b> It had a conventional fixed landing gear, with a rear skid, base 2.68 m. in The closed cabin had {{a capacity of}} six: a pilot, a mechanic and 4 passengers (R-XVIa) or four: a pilot, a doctor, and two lying on stretchers (R-XVIb).|$|R
60|$|Off {{came the}} pillows—blankets—sheets—finally the mattress. This last, a thin cotton affair, left {{a trail of}} fuzzy, lint-like debris behind it and {{disclosed}} on removal a <b>canvas</b> <b>cover</b> that had been spread underneath. The canvas, which was about on a level with the boxed-in bed frame, was as full of holes as a Swiss cheese and especially toward the center the weave had become disintegrated and given away to a dusty pulp.|$|E

To hear and see the fight the whole night through, and never to pull a lanyard or take the tompions out of my guns. Twice I opened my pistol-case to blow out my brains, and it was but the thought that Nelson might have a use for me that held me back." ...|$|E
60|$|As I lingered a light {{began to}} tremble in the heavens. A cock crew in the distance. I {{sat down on a}} fallen log to rest. But presently, as the light grew, I heard shouts which drew nearer and deeper and brought me to my feet in an {{uncertainty}} of expectation. Next came the rattling of chains, the scramble of hoofs in the mire, and here was a wagon with a big <b>canvas</b> <b>cover.</b> Beside the straining horses was a great, burly man with a red beard, cracking his long whip, and calling to the horses in a strange tongue. He stopped still beside his panting animals when he saw me, his high boots sunk in the mud.|$|E

60|$|I {{flung the}} <b>canvas</b> <b>cover</b> over the bay packhorse.... Something took place. I heard a bang, a clatter, a {{rattling}} of hoofs. I peered around {{the bay and}} saw the blue pony performing {{some of the most}} finished, vigorous, and varied bucking it has ever been given me to witness. He all but threw somersaults. He stood on his upper lip. He humped up his back till he looked like a lean cat on a graveyard fence. He stood on his toe calks and spun like a weather-vane on a livery stable, and when the pack exploded and the saddle slipped under his belly, he kicked it to pieces by using both hind hoofs as featly as a man would stroke his beard.|$|E

Mame is waiting for a freight wagon that is going to take her to Oklahoma, but I condemns the freight wagon with promptness and scorn, and offers to deliver the goods myself. Ma Dugan sees no reason why not, as Mr. Freighter wants pay for the job; so, thirty minutes later Mame and I pull out in my light spring wagon with white <b>canvas</b> <b>cover,</b> and head due south.|$|E
60|$|In the English boats two tubs {{are used}} instead of one; the same line being {{continuously}} coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one-half inch in thickness; for {{the bottom of the}} whale-boat is like critical ice, which will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated one. When the painted <b>canvas</b> <b>cover</b> is clapped on the american line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.|$|E

6000|$|A week later, a {{train of}} seven waggons stood with the oxen [...] "inspanned," [...] or yoked, {{ready to leave}} the camp, from which many similar trains had {{previously}} set out. The length of such a train may be conceived when it is told that each waggon was drawn by twelve or sixteen oxen. These were fastened in pairs to a single trace or [...] "trektow" [...] of twisted thongs of bullock or buffalo hide, strong enough for a ship's cable. Each waggon had a <b>canvas</b> <b>cover</b> or [...] "till" [...] to protect its goods and occupants {{from the sun and}} rain, and each was driven by a tall Dutchman, who carried a bamboo whip like a salmon fishing-rod with a lash of thirty feet or more. A slave, Hottentot or Bushman, led the two front oxen of each span.|$|E
60|$|This {{was their}} home. The tent that had {{sheltered}} Marjorie {{on the way}} up was erected close to this hut to serve as a rude scullery and outhouse, and they also made a long, roughly thatched roof with a <b>canvas</b> <b>cover,</b> supported on stakes, to shelter the rest of the stores. The stuff in tins and cases and jars they left on the ground under this; the rest--the flour, candles, bacon, dried caribou beef, and so forth, they hung, as they hoped, {{out of the reach of}} any prowling beast. And finally and most important was the wood pile. This they accumulated to the north and east of the hut, and all day long with a sort of ant-like perseverance Trafford added to it from the thickets below. Once or twice, however, tempted by the appearance of birds, he went shooting, and one day he got five geese that they spent a day upon, plucking, cleaning, boiling and putting up in all their store of empty cans, letting the fat float and solidify on the top to preserve this addition to their provision until the advent of the frost rendered all other preservatives unnecessary. They also tried to catch trout down in the river below, but though they saw many fish the catch was less than a dozen.|$|E
60|$|When {{the chest}} or box {{was placed on}} the surface, and the lid forced up by a pickaxe, there was {{displayed}} first a coarse <b>canvas</b> <b>cover,</b> then a quantity of oakum, and beneath that a number of ingots of silver. A general exclamation hailed a discovery so surprising and unexpected. The Baronet threw his hands and eyes up to heaven, with the silent rapture of one who is delivered from inexpressible distress of mind. Oldbuck, almost unable to credit his eyes, lifted one piece of silver after another. There was neither inscription nor stamp upon them, excepting one, which seemed to be Spanish. He could have no doubt of the purity and great value of the treasure before him. Still, however, removing piece by piece, he examined row by row, expecting to discover that the lower layers were of inferior value; but he could perceive no difference in this respect, and found himself compelled to admit, that Sir Arthur had possessed himself of bullion to the value, perhaps of a thousand pounds sterling. Sir Arthur now promised the assistants a handsome recompense for their trouble, and began to busy himself about the mode of conveying this rich windfall to the Castle of Knockwinnock, when the adept, recovering from his surprise, which had equalled that exhibited by any other individual of the party, twitched his sleeve, and having offered his humble congratulations, turned next to Oldbuck with an air of triumph.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was designed by}} Willy Sabersky-Müssigbrodt and developed by Luft-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (LVG) in 1917. The C.VI was a further development of the C.V, which Sabersky-Müssigbrodt had made for his former employer DFW. It was lighter, smaller and aerodynamically refined, although its fuselage seemed more bulky. It was a biplane of mixed, mostly wooden construction. It featured a semi-monocoque fuselage, plywood covered. Rectangular wings of wooden and metal construction, <b>canvas</b> <b>covered.</b> Upper wing of slightly greater span, shifted some 25 cm (10 in) towards front. Vertical fin plywood covered, rudder and elevators of metal frame <b>canvas</b> <b>covered,</b> stabilizers (tailplanes) of wooden frame <b>canvas</b> <b>covered.</b> Straight uncovered engine in the fuselage nose, with a chimney-like exhaust pipe. Two-blade Benz wooden propeller, 2.88 m (9.45 ft) diameter. Flat water radiator in central section of upper wing. Fixed conventional landing gear, with a straight common axle and a rear skid.Aircraft were equipped with a radio (morse;send only); transmissions were {{by means of an}} antenna which could be lowered below the aircraft when needed. The crew had parachutes and heated flying suits.A total of 1,100 aircraft of the type were manufactured.|$|R

50|$|An {{atmometer}} {{consists of}} a porous, ceramic plate connected to a water reservoir by a glass or plastic tube. The device stands around 1.5 - 2 ft tall with a diameter of 3 - 4 in. Water is drawn from the water reservoir through the tube to wet the plate. As the water on the plate evaporates, more water is drawn from the reservoir to re-wet the plate. A <b>canvas</b> <b>cover</b> made of Gore-Tex is placed over the plate to prevent anything from getting in. The <b>canvas</b> <b>cover</b> {{is important because it}} simulates the amount of solar radiation a plant absorbs under certain weather conditions and controls the rate of evaporation. Different types of canvas covers simulate different amounts of evapotranspiration rates that various plant surfaces would undergo. For example, alfalfa ET rates are estimated using the No. 54 green <b>canvas</b> <b>cover,</b> while grass ET rates are estimated using the No. 30 green <b>canvas</b> <b>cover.</b> A membrane between the plate and <b>canvas</b> <b>cover</b> prevents rain water from wetting the gauge yet allows water vapor to escape. A gauge that runs {{up the side of the}} atmometer measures the level of water (in inches) in the reservoir, which shows how much water has evaporated.|$|E
