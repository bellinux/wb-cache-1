25|$|A {{tourniquet}} can {{be defined}} as a constricting or compressing device used to control arterial and venous blood flow to a portion of an extremity for a period of time. Pressure is applied <b>circumferentially</b> around a portion of a limb at a desired location; this pressure is transferred to the walls of blood vessels, causing them to become temporarily occluded or restricted. In surgical settings, a tourniquet is used to occlude arterial blood flow following exsanguination to produce a relatively bloodless operative field and to minimize blood loss. In emergency settings, a tourniquet is used stop traumatic bleeding such that medical care can be provided in time before the injured person bleeds out. In rehabilitation settings, a tourniquet is used to restrict arterial blood flow at a consistent and safe pressure for short periods of time during low intensity exercise to more rapidly increase muscle size and strength.|$|E
25|$|Kliper's {{design was}} {{another attempt to}} solve the {{geometric}} problems of spacecraft. Soyuz has an Orbital Module, a hollow sphere, {{to be used for}} eating and hygiene, and an airlock located above the Reentry module (the capsule), with the docking mechanism at the top. In the event of an emergency, it would be lifted away from the rocket along with the reentry module, and the fairing over the spacecraft was designed to successfully split apart either <b>circumferentially</b> just below the reentry module in such an emergency or longitudinally if the flight should be successful. Kliper was designed with the Orbital Module below its reentry module, and the docking mechanism below that. This was made possible by constructing a reentry module broader than the orbital module, so that a pair of rocket nozzles for orbital maneuvering could have been fitted alongside it, as the later Salyut space stations had.|$|E
25|$|Follow-up imaging {{in women}} of {{reproductive}} age for incidentally discovered simple cysts on ultrasound {{is not needed}} until 5cm, as these are usually normal ovarian follicles. Simple cysts 5to 7cm in premenopausal females should be followed yearly. Simple cysts larger than 7cm require further imaging with MRI or surgical assessment. Because they are large, they cannot be reliably assessed by ultrasound alone because {{it may be difficult}} to see the soft tissue nodularity or thickened septation at their posterior wall due to limited penetrance of the ultrasound beam. For the corpus luteum, a dominant ovulating follicle that typically appears as a cyst with <b>circumferentially</b> thickened walls and crenulated inner margins, follow up is not needed if the cyst is less than 3cm in diameter. In postmenopausal patients, any simple cyst greater than 1cm but less than 7cm needs yearly follow-up, while those greater than 7cm need MRI or surgical evaluation, similar to reproductive age females.|$|E
2500|$|For {{uncomplicated}} silicosis, {{chest x-ray}} will confirm {{the presence of}} small (< 10nbsp&mm) nodules in the lungs, especially in the upper lung zones. [...] Using the ILO classification system, these are of profusion 1/0 or greater and shape/size [...] "p", [...] "q", or [...] "r". Lung zone involvement and profusion increases with disease progression. In advanced cases of silicosis, large opacity (> 1nbsp&cm) occurs from coalescence of small opacities, particularly in the upper lung zones. With retraction of the lung tissue, there is compensatory emphysema. Enlargement of the hilum is common with chronic and accelerated silicosis. In about 5–10% of cases, the nodes will calcify <b>circumferentially,</b> producing so-called [...] "eggshell" [...] calcification. [...] This finding is not pathognomonic (diagnostic) of silicosis. In some cases, the pulmonary nodules may also become calcified.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trampoline}} effect, {{which is}} common terminology for baseball players, is the phenomenon when the baseball [...] "jumps" [...] {{off the bat}} at contact. The bat-ball collision can be demonstrated from the physics of elastic collisions. The stiffer {{the barrel of the}} bat, the slower the baseball comes off the bat because it loses energy in the collision. The softer the barrel of the bat, the faster the baseball comes off the bat because it retains its energy applied by the pitcher. The trampoline effect has been experimentally tested, and results show that composite bats outperform all-aluminum bats. The reason why composite bats outperform other aluminum bats is that the trampoline effect can essentially be [...] "tuned." [...] Composite materials have properties that are different in all directions, or anisotropy, which allows the bat manufacturer to design the bat stiff longitudinally (along the handle) and softer <b>circumferentially</b> (around the barrel). This softer barrel allows the ball to come off with less energy loss while maintaining the stiffness of the bat in the handle.|$|E
2500|$|The next type of {{combustor}} is the cannular combustor; {{the term}} is a portmanteau of [...] "can annular". Like the can type combustor, can annular combustors have discrete combustion zones contained in separate liners with their own fuel injectors. Unlike the can combustor, all the combustion zones share a common ring (annulus) casing. Each combustion zone no longer has {{to serve as a}} pressure vessel. The combustion zones can also [...] "communicate" [...] with each other via liner holes or connecting tubes that allow some air to flow <b>circumferentially.</b> The exit flow from the cannular combustor generally has a more uniform temperature profile, which is better for the turbine section. It also eliminates the need for each chamber to have its own igniter. Once the fire is lit in one or two cans, it can easily spread to and ignite the others. This type of combustor is [...] also lighter than the can type, and has a lower pressure drop (on the order of 6%). However, a cannular combustor can be more difficult to maintain than a can combustor. An example of a gas turbine engine utilizing a cannular combustor is the General Electric J79 The Pratt & Whitney JT8D and the Rolls-Royce Tay turbofans use this type of combustor as well.|$|E

6000|$|Outside {{the circle}} of piles there was, at a {{distance}} of 12 to 14 feet, [...] another wooden structure {{in the shape of a}} broad ring of horizontal [...] beams and piles which surrounded the central area. The breadth of [...] this outer ring was 7 feet, and it consisted of some nine rows of [...] beams running <b>circumferentially.</b> Beyond this lay scattered about some [...] rough cobble stones, as if they had fallen down from a stone structure [...] which had been raised over the woodwork. The space intervening [...] between these wooden structures was filled up in its eastern third [...] with a refuse heap, consisting of broken and partially burnt bones of [...] various animals, the shells of edible molluscs, and a quantity of [...] ashes and charcoal, evidently the debris of human occupancy. On the [...] north, or landward side, the outer and inner basements of woodwork [...] appeared to coalesce for 5 or 6 yards, leaving an open space having [...] stones embedded in the mud and decayed wood, a condition of things [...] which suggested a rude causeway. When Mr. Donnelly drew my attention [...] to this, I demurred to its being so characterised owing to its [...] indefiniteness. At the outer limit of this so-called causeway, and [...] about 25 feet north-east of {{the circle of}} piles, a canoe was [...] discovered lying in a kind of dock, rudely constructed of side stones [...] and wooden piling. The canoe measures 35.5 feet long, 4 feet broad, [...] and 1.5 foot deep. It has a square stern with a movable board, two [...] grasping holes near the stem, and three round perforations (2 inches [...] in diameter) in its bottom. On the north-west border of the [...] log-pavement a massive ladder of oak was found, one end resting on the [...] margin of the log-pavement and the other projecting obliquely into the [...] timberless zone between the former and the outer woodwork.

5000|$|The tread is {{the part}} of the tire that comes in contact with the road surface. The portion that is in contact with the road at a given instant in time is the contact patch. The tread is a thick rubber, or rubber/composite {{compound}} formulated to provide an appropriate level of traction that does not wear away too quickly. The tread pattern is characterized by the geometrical shape of the grooves, lugs, [...] and sipes. Grooves run <b>circumferentially</b> around the tire, and are needed to channel away water. Lugs are that portion of the tread design that contacts the road surface. Voids are spaces between lugs that allow the lugs to flex and evacuate water. Tread patterns feature non-symmetrical (or non-uniform) lug sizes <b>circumferentially</b> to minimize noise levels at discrete frequencies. Sipes are slits cut across the tire, usually perpendicular to the grooves, which allow the water from the grooves to escape to the sides in an effort to prevent hydroplaning.|$|E
50|$|Tread lugs {{provide the}} contact surface {{necessary}} to provide traction. As the tread lug enters the road contact area, or footprint, it is compressed. As it rotates through the footprint it is deformed <b>circumferentially.</b> As it exits the footprint, it recovers to its original shape. During the deformation and recovery cycle the tire exerts variable forces into the vehicle. These forces are described as Force Variation.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} installations use single tappings upstream and downstream, but in {{some circumstances}} these may be unreliable; they might be blocked by solids or gas-bubbles, or the flow profile might be uneven so that the pressures at the tappings are higher or lower than the average in those planes.
