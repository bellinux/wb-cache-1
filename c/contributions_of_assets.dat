40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to ascertain which of the two models (i) a model based on earnings variables alone and (ii) a model based on both net asset and earnings variables proves to be better than the other in valuing private enterprises in Nigeria using three sample firms. It is true assets are very important in a firm but it is not easy to adjust the value of the assets in the balance sheet to get the net asset because of the obvious differences between the historical cost of the assets and their current market value. To incorporate asset variables in model (ii), equity value was ascertained by subtracting long-term debt (balance sheet item) from firm value. Model (ii) therefore which recognizes the <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> in earning potentials of a firm appears to be better than the model that recognizes earnings alone. The theoretical formulations, and empirical support of the valuation approaches are evidence of the model`s reliability and validity...|$|E
40|$|So far, {{regulatory}} capital requirements for credit risk portfolios are calculated in a bottom up approach by determining the requirements at asset level and then adding up them. In contrast, economic capital for a credit risk portfolio is {{calculated for the}} portfolio {{as a whole and}} then decomposed into risk <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> or subportfolios for, e. g., diagnostic purposes like identifying risk concentrations. In the “Asymptotic Single Risk Factor ” model that underlies {{the most important part of}} the “Basel II Accord”, bottomup and topdown approach yield identical results. However, the model fails in detecting exposure concentra tions and recognizing diversification effects. We investigate multifactor extensions of the ASRF model and derive exact formulae for the risk contributions to ValueatRisk and Ex pected Shortfall. As an application of the risk contribution formulae we introduce a new concept for a diversification index. The use of this new index is illustrated with an example calculated with a twofactor model. The results with this model indicate that there can be a substantial reduction of risk contributions by diversification effects...|$|E

40|$|The private pension {{structure}} in the United States was once dominated by defined benefit (DB) plans, but it is currently divided between DB and defined contribution (DC) plans. Wealth accumulation in DC plans depends on financial market returns, while accumulation in a DB pension is very sensitive to an individual’s labor market experience. This paper examines how the expansion of DC plans affects the average level of private retirement wealth and the variation in retirement wealth across households. It considers the stochastic <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> returns, earnings histories, and retirement plan characteristics {{using data from the}} Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The analysis simulates retirement wealth accumulation under DC and DB plans. For DC plans, the analysis matches individuals to randomly-selected DC plans and draws asset returns from historical distributions. It allows for various asset allocation strategies and expense ratios. For DB plans, the analysis draws earnings histories from the HRS, and randomly assigns a pension plan to each job the individual holds. These procedures generate a distribution of potential DC and potential DB accruals that reflect the structure of DB and DC plans, the stochastic structure of earnings over the lifecycle, and the random <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> returns to retirement wealth.

40|$|Risk Parity (RP), {{also called}} equally {{weighted}} risk contribution, {{is a recent}} approach to risk diversication in portfolio selection. RP {{is based on the}} principle that the fractions of the capital invested in each asset should be chosen so as to make the total risk <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> all <b>assets</b> equal among them. We show here that the Risk Parity approach is theoretically dominated by an alternative similar approach that does not actually require equally weighted risk <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> all <b>assets</b> but only an equal upper bound on all such risks. We call it the Equal Risk Bounding (ERB) approach. This alternative approach might, and actually does in some cases, select portfolios that do not contain all assets and where the risk <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> all <b>assets</b> is strictly smaller than in the RP portfolio. We prove some relations between the solutions of the ERB and of the RP models and we use such relations to provide a finite method for finding an ERB portfolio. In the case of equal correlation, a closed form solution to the ERB model is also provided. Some numerical examples illustrate the advantages of the ERB approach over the RP approach...|$|R

50|$|We {{also know}} that, at least amongst the Gaulish {{and the early}} medieval Irish nobility, {{polygyny}} was a widespread practice.

RP {{is based on the}} principle that the fractions of the capital invested in each asset should be chosen so as to make the total risk <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> all <b>assets</b> equal among them. We show here that the Risk Parity approach is theoretically dominated by an alternative similar approach that does not actually require equally weighted risk <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> all <b>assets</b> but only an equal upper bound on all such risks. This alternative approach, called Equal Risk Bounding (ERB), requires the solution of a nonconvex quadratically constrained optimization problem. The ERB approach, while starting from different requirements, turns out to be strictly linked to the RP approach. Indeed, when short selling is allowed, we prove that an ERB portfolio is actually an RP portfolio with minimum variance. When short selling is not allowed, there is a unique RP portfolio and it contains all assets in the market. In this case, the ERB approach might lead to the RP portfolio or it might lead to portfolios with smaller variance that do not contain all assets, and where the risk <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> each <b>asset</b> included in the portfolio is strictly smaller than in the RP portfolio. We define a new riskiness index for assets that allows to identify those assets that {{are more likely to be}} excluded from the ERB portfolio. With these tools we then provide an exact method for small size nonconvex ERB models and a very efficient and accurate heuristic for larger problems of this type. In the case of a common constant pairwise correlation among all assets, a closed form solution to the ERB model is obtained and used to perform a parametric analysis when varying the level of correlation. The practical advantages of the ERB approach over the RP strategy are illustrated with some numerical examples. Computational experience on real-world and on simulated data confirms accuracy and efficiency of our heuristic approach to the ERB model also in comparison with some state-of-the-art local and global optimization codes...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to focus on small and medium {{enterprises}} (SMEs) in an attempt to cover the gap in research on intellectual capital (IC) applied to SMEs. The paper informs the debate on the importance of IC by providing empirical evidence of SME managers’ perceptions about the importance and <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> intangible <b>assets</b> to their businesses. Design/methodology/approach – Questionnaires were sent to New Zealand SMEs investigating managers’ perceptions about the importance <b>of</b> and the <b>contributions</b> that intangible asset components make to their businesses, and to assess their familiarity with the term intellectual capital (IC) and their preferences in using the term IC versus intangible assets. The results pertaining to the importance <b>of</b> intangible <b>assets</b> were statistically analysed. Findings – This paper informs that the broad assumption that intangible assets are important and are value drivers of business’ success is valid for small and medium enterprises. The majority of respondents perceive intangible asset components to be essential, very important and important to the success of their business and that these components collectively make several contributions to their businesses. Based on average rating, customer satisfaction ranked as the most important and thereafter customer loyalty, corporate reputation, product reputation and employee know-how. A minority of respondents indicated that only a few components are not very important and not important at all, the least important component being distribution agreements, followed by employee education and relationships with investors. The majority of respondents are familiar with the term IC, and the same number prefer to use the term “intangible assets” as those preferring to use the term IC. Practical implications – Providing evidence of SME managers’ perceptions of the importance and <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> intangible <b>assets</b> is essential to raise awareness among SME managers in understanding, identifying and managing intangible assets that are important value drivers for their businesses. Such awareness is essential in particular in countries where SMEs make up a significant proportion of business and employment.

Originality/value – This paper is the first providing empirical evidence as to SME managers’ perceptions about the importance <b>of</b> and the <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> intangible <b>assets</b> to their businesses, as well as about their familiarity with the IC concept and preference in using IC terminology...|$|R

40|$|The {{classical}} {{approach to}} portfolio selection calls for finding a feasible portfolio that optimizes {{one of the}} several proposed risk measures, or (expected) utility functions, or performance indexes. However, the optimization approach might be misleading due {{to the difficulty of}} obtaining good estimates for the parameters involved in thefunction to be optimized and to the high sensitivity of the optimal solutions to the input data. This observation has led some researchers to claim that a straightforward capital diversification, i. e., the Equally Weighted portfolio can hardly be beaten by an optimized portfolio [3]. However, if the market contains assets with very different intrinsic risks, then this leads to a portfolio with limited total risk diversification. Therefore, alternative risk diversification approaches to portfolio selection have been proposed, such as the practitioners’ approach of taking weights proportional to 1 /σi, where σi is the volatility <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> i. A more thorough approach to risk diversification requires to formalize the notion <b>of</b> risk <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> each <b>asset,</b> and then to manage it by a model. For example the Risk Parity approach (see [5], and references therein) aims at a portfolio where the total risk <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> all <b>assets</b> are equal among them [4]. The original risk parity approach was applied to volatility. However alternative risk measures can also be considered (see, e. g., [1]). It can also be shown that the Risk Parity approach is actually dominated by Equal Risk Bounding [2], where the total risk <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> all <b>assets</b> are bounded by a common threshold which is then minimized. Furthermore, several alternative approaches to diversify risk have recently appeared in the literature. We propose here a new approach that tries to reduce the impact of data estimation errors and to join the benefits of the optimization and of the diversification approaches by choosing the portfolio that is best diversified (e. g., Equally Weighted or Risk Parity) on a subset <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> the market, and that optimizes an appropriate risk, or utility, or performance measure among all portfolios of this type. We show that this approach yields portfolios that are only slightly suboptimal in-sample, and generally show improved out-of-sample performance with respect to their purely diversified or purely optimized counterparts.
