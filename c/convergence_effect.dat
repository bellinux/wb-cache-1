40|$|In {{the course}} of a conversation, {{imitation}} between speakers tends to occur at multiple levels, which include posture, head movements, facial expression and speech (see Pardo, 2006, for a recent survey). One of the functions of this imitative behavior is thought to be the facilitation of mutual comprehension. Concerning speech, <b>convergence</b> <b>effects</b> have been observed in mean vocal intensity, speech rate, utterance duration, and pitch contour. However, despite the apparently systematic character of imitation and its multiple levels of occurrence, {{there is a great deal}} of inter‐speaker variability in the observed patterns of phonetic convergence, which remains to be explained. The objective of this work is twofold. First, we seek to characterize the way in which two speakers engaged in a face‐to‐face conversation may influence each other at the phonetic and phonological levels. Second, we ask whether <b>convergence</b> <b>effects</b> can be related to measures of the speakers' social competence. Our experiment focuses on conversational interaction between native speakers of two different varieties of French, namely standard French and southern French, which show well‐established differences at both the phonological and phonetic levels.

Optimization {{problems}} in discrete {{time can be}} modeled more flexibly by extended linearquadratic programming than by traditional linear or quadratic programming, because penalties and other expressions that may substitute for constraints can readily be incorporated and dualized. At the same time, dynamics can be written with state vectors as in dynamic programming and optimal control. This suggests new primal-dual approaches to solving multistage problems. The special setting for such numerical methods is described.

40|$|International audiencePhonetic imitation, {{also called}} phonetic convergence, is {{currently}} {{at the heart}} of numerous investigations since it can inform us on both the nature of lexical representations and the link between production and perception processes in spoken language communication. A task that has been largely used to study phonetic imitation is the shadowing task, in which participants merely listen to and repeat isolated words. In this study, we examined {{the extent to which the}} phonetic <b>convergence</b> <b>effect</b> found when participants shadow auditory tokens, is an imitation of the speaker. We thus compared the phonetic <b>convergence</b> <b>effect</b> observed in a shadowing task to that observed when participants were explicitly instructed to imitate the productions they were exposed to. Although the phonetic <b>convergence</b> <b>effect</b> was greater when participants intentionally imitated the speaker's productions, shadowing and imitation instructions led to the same degree of convergence in a post-exposure task. Hence, the <b>convergence</b> <b>effect</b> found in a shadowing task and that found in an imitation task seem to share a general mechanism which is automatic and which taps into the long-term representations of the words in memory. At a more theoretical level, our results reinforce the claim that detailed auditory traces associated with perceived words are stored in memory and are later used for production...|$|E

We build a model of technology diffusion in which follower economies achieve productivity growth {{by taking advantage of}} technology spillovers from the world technology frontier. We hypothesize that China's regional productivity growth is a positive function of regional openness and a negative function of the current level of regional productivity. Empirical analysis in this paper focuses on how openness affects productivity growth in the Chinese provinces. We examine two effects of openness on regional productivity growth in China: the direct growth effect and the <b>convergence</b> <b>effect.</b> By using a variety of panel data regression techniques, we show that the direct growth effect of openness is the main effect while the <b>convergence</b> <b>effect</b> is insignificant.

Except in narrow circumstances, the traditional distinction between industry specialization and regional diversity is misplaced, failing to capture the linkages among related industries or the importance of spillovers from proximate regions. Building on Porter’s (1990, 2001) concept of clusters, we offer a systematic evaluation {{of the relationship between}} regional cluster composition and the employment and patent growth of regional economic areas, clusters and industries. Our approach allows us to separately disentangle the impact of convergence from agglomeration. The cluster framework suggests three key spillovers influencing economic performance: within cluster, across linked clusters, and across common clusters in neighboring regions. Using newly available data from the US Cluster Mapping Project, the empirical analysis exploits a rich panel dataset at the industry-cluster-region level between 1990 and 2003.

40|$|As {{economic}} internationalization advances, {{the question}} of how firms cope with increasing pressure for competitiveness gains momentum. While scholars agree that firms need a competitive advantage, they debate whether firms exploit the comparative advantage of their economy and converge on that strategy facilitated by national institutions. `No', argue strategic management proponents of the resource-based view. `Yes', claim contributors to the competitiveness literature. The author's micro-level studies of these opposing views do not find evidence for a strong, widespread convergence by the firms in one economy to the same institutionally supported strategy. The discrepancies between these findings and the analyses of the competitiveness literature are attributed to differences in the indicators employed to measure corporate strategies.

Similar AC/A ratios were found after 45 minutes of monocular occlusion. Our results clearly demonstrate relatively normal response AC/A ratios in these subjects.

Yet, between 2002 and 2009, China experienced a 3 % increase in carbon intensity, though trends differed greatly among its 30 provinces. Decomposition analysis shows that sectoral efficiency gains in nearly all provinces were offset by movement towards a more carbon-intensive economic structure. Such a sectoral shift seemed to be heavily affected by the growing role of investments and capital accumulation in China's growth process which has favoured sectors with high carbon intensity.
