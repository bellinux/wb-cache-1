40|$|AbstractThe <b>coal</b> sample <b>preparation</b> is an {{important}} part for the study of coal's character, and therefore, the man-made secondary carbonization method of <b>coal</b> sample <b>preparation</b> was explored in the text. Firstly, the scheme of secondary carbonization was designed, and then, according to it, the heat transmission and the temperature field evolvement rule were analyzed in the process of carbonization. Finally, the secondary carbonization experiment of <b>coal</b> sample <b>preparation</b> was conducted, and the coal sample was obtained successfully. The results show that the temperature rise velocity in the center of coal sample is from fast to slow in the process of secondary carbonization, and the reasonable calefaction time is about 15000 seconds...|$|R

25|$|A coal breaker is a coal {{processing}} plant which breaks coal into various useful sizes. Coal breakers also remove impurities from the coal (typically slate) and deposit {{them into a}} culm dump. The coal breaker is a forerunner of the modern <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> plant.|$|E
25|$|The most {{economical}} {{method of}} coal extraction from coal seams {{depends on the}} depth {{and quality of the}} seams, and the geology and environmental factors. Coal mining processes are differentiated by whether they operate on the surface or underground. Many coals extracted from both surface and underground mines require washing in a <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> plant. Technical and economic feasibility are evaluated based on the following: regional geological conditions; overburden characteristics; coal seam continuity, thickness, structure, quality, and depth; strength of materials above and below the seam for roof and floor conditions; topography (especially altitude and slope); climate; land ownership as it affects the availability of land for mining and access; surface drainage patterns; ground water conditions; availability of labor and materials; coal purchaser requirements in terms of tonnage, quality, and destination; and capital investment requirements.|$|E
25|$|When coal seams {{are near}} the surface, it may be {{economical}} to extract the coal using open cut (also referred to as open cast, open pit, mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Open cast coal mining recovers {{a greater proportion of}} the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which operate by removing the overburden, power shovels, large trucks in which transport overburden and coal, bucket wheel excavators, and conveyors. In this mining method, explosives are first used in order to break through the surface or overburden, of the mining area. The overburden is then removed by draglines or by shovel and truck. Once the coal seam is exposed, it is drilled, fractured and thoroughly mined in strips. The coal is then loaded onto large trucks or conveyors for transport to either the <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> plant or directly to where it will be used.|$|E

5000|$|The {{mine was}} {{established}} by the Utah Development Company in 1967. Mining operations at South Blackwater mine were incorporated into Blackwater coal mine in late 2000. [...] In 2007, a new <b>coal</b> handling <b>preparation</b> allowed for {{a significant increase in}} production.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2012, it was {{announced}} that production at the mine was to cease on 10 October 2012. [...] Due to falling coal prices the mine had become uneconomic. The Crinum underground mine was not closed and the <b>coal</b> handling <b>preparation</b> plant at Gregory would continue to be used.|$|R
25|$|Along {{with the}} property, Hokutan also bought the rights for prison labor, so the miners mostly {{consisted}} of prisoners. It continued until 1894, when the Meiji government {{under the pressure}} of the public opinion led by Protestant prison director Ōinoue Terusaki (1848-1912), decided on the abolition of prison labour. The prisoners were substituted by other forms of recruitment as that of subcontractors (飯場制度, hanbaseidō) and direct recruitment as well as a thorough mechanization. In 1938, the Tokiwakō (常磐坑), two inclined shafts were mined. Along these the coal was transported towards the <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> plant. In 1952, these shafts were equipped with conveyor belts. When in 1967, the Horonai mine merged with the Shin-Horonai mine (新幌内炭鉱, shin Horonai tankō), these belts transported coal from a depth of 520 meters, over a distance of 2.720 meters towards the plant. The merged Hokutan Horonai mine was equipped with two modern deep shafts and used drum cutters since 1968, which made {{it one of the most}} modern mines of Japan.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{cultural}} investments {{were carried out}} in 1958: the newspaper Det nye Kingsbay was published, a public library was established and the school {{moved to a new}} building. By 1959 Ester I was depleted and the railway was closed—transport having been taken over by trucks. That year only 8,000 tonnes were exported. A new shaft was opened the following year, allowing mining to start in Vestre Senterfelt. Production in 1960 hit a record 79,000 tonnes of raw coal, which after being processed through the new <b>coal</b> <b>preparation</b> plant resulted in 51,000 tonnes. Start of a coke plant in Mo i Rana helped stimulate the domestic coal demand. Washed coal production hit 54,000 tonnes in 1961. By then NOK21 million had been invested in the past years, although the coal prices had continued to fall, and especially in Norway the demand had diminished. Norway was retiring its last steam locomotives, but unlike in most of Europe it was not replicating the coal demand through construction of coal-fueled thermal power plants. By 1962 Ny-Ålesund had 25 family apartments and barracks for 210 male employees. Production hit 75,000 tonnes of washed coal in 1962.|$|E

But he argued that revolutionary propaganda was a delicate work of high conscience. It was the education of the masters of the world. It should be as careful as the education given to kings. He would have it advance its tenets cautiously, even timidly, in our ignorance of the effect that may be produced by any given economic change upon the happiness, the morals, the intellect, the history of mankind.
