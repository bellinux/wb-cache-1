50|$|In {{telecommunication}} and horology, a slave <b>clock</b> is a <b>clock</b> {{that depends}} for its accuracy on another <b>clock,</b> a master <b>clock.</b> Many modern <b>clocks</b> are synchronized, either through the Internet or by radio time signals, to a worldwide time standard called Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) {{based on a}} network of master atomic <b>clocks</b> in many countries. For scientific purposes, precision <b>clocks</b> can be synchronized to within a few nanoseconds by dedicated satellite channels. Slave <b>clock</b> synchronization is usually achieved by phase-locking the slave <b>clock</b> signal to a signal received from the master <b>clock.</b> To adjust for the transit time of the signal from the master <b>clock</b> to the slave <b>clock,</b> the phase of the slave <b>clock</b> may be adjusted {{with respect to the}} signal from the master <b>clock</b> so that both <b>clocks</b> are in phase. Thus, the time markers of both <b>clocks,</b> at the output of the <b>clocks,</b> occur simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|A <b>clock</b> {{that employs}} {{electricity}} {{in some form}} to power a conventional <b>clock</b> mechanism is an electromechanical <b>clock.</b> Any spring or weight driven <b>clock</b> that uses electricity (either AC or DC) to rewind the spring or raise {{the weight of a}} mechanical <b>clock</b> then is an electromechanical <b>clock.</b> In electromechanical <b>clocks</b> the electricity serves no time keeping function. The timekeeping function is regulated by the pendulum. Near {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, the availability of the dry cell battery made it practical to use electric power in <b>clocks.</b> The use of electricity then led to many variations of <b>clock</b> and motor designs. Electromechanical <b>clocks</b> were made as individual timepieces but most commonly were used as integral parts of synchronized time installations. Experience in telegraphy led to connecting remote <b>clocks</b> (slave <b>clocks)</b> via wires to a controlling (master <b>clock)</b> <b>clock.</b> The goal was to create a <b>clock</b> system where each <b>clock</b> displayed exactly the same time. The master and the slaves are electromechanical <b>clocks.</b> The master <b>clock</b> has a conventional self-winding <b>clock</b> mechanism that is rewound electrically. The slave <b>clock</b> mechanism is not a conventional <b>clock</b> mechanism as it consists only of a ratchet wheel and time train. Slave <b>clocks</b> rely upon electrical impulses from the master <b>clock</b> to mechanically move the <b>clock</b> hands one unit of time. Synchronized time systems are made up of one master <b>clock</b> and any number of slave <b>clocks.</b> The slave <b>clocks</b> are connected by wires to the master <b>clock.</b> These systems are found in locations where multiple <b>clocks</b> would be used such as learning institutions, businesses, factories, transportation networks, banks, offices and government facilities. A notable example of this type of system is the Shortt-Synchronome <b>clock,</b> which is an example of an electromechanical gravity remontoire. These self-winding <b>clock</b> systems were usually low voltage DC. They were installed thru the 1950s and by then systems with synchronous motor <b>clocks</b> were becoming the <b>clock</b> system of choice.|$|R
