50|$|MI8, or Military Intelligence, Section 8 was a British Military Intelligence group {{responsible}} for signals intelligence and {{was created in}} 1914. It originally consisted of four sections: MI8(a), which dealt with wireless policy; MI8(b), based at the General Post Office, dealt with commercial and trade cables; MI8(c) dealt with the distribution of intelligence derived from censorship; and MI8(d), which liaised with the cable companies. During World War I MI8 officers were posted to the <b>cable</b> <b>terminals</b> at Poldhu Point and Mullion in Cornwall and Clifden in County Galway, continued until 1917 when the work {{was taken over by}} the Admiralty. In WW2, MI8 was {{responsible for}} the extensive War Office Y Group and briefly, for the Radio Security Service.|$|E
50|$|To {{address the}} {{vaulting}} and rollover crashes, energy-absorbing terminals were developed. The {{first generation of}} these terminals in the 1970s were breakaway <b>cable</b> <b>terminals,</b> in which the rail curves back on itself and is connected to a cable that runs {{between the first and}} second posts (which are often breakaway posts). The second generation, in the 1990s and 2000s, feature a large steel impact head that engages the frame or bumper of the vehicle. The impact head is driven back along the guide rail, dissipating the vehicle's kinetic energy by bending or tearing the steel in the guide rail sections. A guide rail may also be terminated by curving it back to the point that the terminal is unlikely to be hit end-on, or, if possible, by embedding the end in a hillside or cut slope.|$|E

As a result, VESDA smoke detection systems were installed in all equipment control cubicles. In 1996, another fire occurred, but was quickly detected and extinguished by control room operators. Only three <b>cable</b> <b>terminals</b> and one wire were burned, with minimal disruption (Anderson, 1996).|$|E
40|$|On-line partial {{discharge}} (PD) detection of three-phase belted medium voltage cable connections {{results in a}} number of interpretation differences as compared to off-line measurements where only one phase is energized. The induced currents and charges in the phase conductors and earth screen upon a PD not only depend on the discharge site, but also become phase angle dependent. Furthermore, simulations show that the PD distribution itself varies with the amount of eccentricity of the rotating electric field and may differ from the off-line distributions obtained with a linear field. Finally, the PD propagation in a multi-conductor cable also alters the signals measured at the <b>cable</b> <b>terminals.</b> In this paper, induced charges and PD distributions are studied by means of computer simulation. The cable propagation characteristics are verified by measurements...|$|E
40|$|A jet {{aircraft}} noise and sonic boom measuring device which converts sound pressure into electric current is described. An electric current {{proportional to the}} sound pressure level at a condenser microphone is produced and transmitted over a cable, amplified by a zero drive amplifier and recorded on magnetic tape. The converter is comprised of a local oscillator, a dual-gate field-effect transistor (FET) mixer and a voltage regulator/impedance translator. A carrier voltage that is applied {{to one of the}} gates of the FET mixer is generated by the local oscillator. The microphone signal is mixed with the carrier to produce an electrical current at the frequency of vibration of the microphone diaphragm by the FET mixer. The voltage of the local oscillator and mixer stages is regulated, the carrier at the output is eliminated, and a low output impedance at the <b>cable</b> <b>terminals</b> is provided by the voltage regulator/impedance translator...|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of failure mechanisms in electrical systems due to electrical connector in a vibrating media often relies {{on only one}} type of electrical environment, i. e. resistive load. However, these are not capable of digging out the behavior of connectors when the electrical system includes other electrical environments, for instance inductive load. The aim of the thesis is to fill this gap, by studying how the damages of electrical contacts in a vibrating environment depend on the electrical environments, in heavy vehicles. The purpose is to investigate, what effects current and voltage have in each electrical environment related to connector’s lifespan and reliability. The main failure mechanism in the connector with tin coated <b>cable</b> <b>terminals</b> are fretting corrosion which is induced by micro oscillatory motion due to vibration and thermal fluctuation. To do so a serie of experimental studies has been conducted for different samples of electrical connectors...|$|E
40|$|Partial {{discharge}} is a main factor {{which causes}} cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cable damaged. In order {{to research the}} Partial Discharge detecting methods of 10 kV XLPE power cable, the electrostatic field is firstly simulated in order to analysis the electric filed at the distortion of the cable. According to the simulation mode, portable thermal infrared imager and ultraviolet imaging instrument is utilized to detect partial discharge of power <b>cable</b> <b>terminals.</b> The experimental results demonstrate {{that the use of}} ultraviolet imaging instrument to detect the location of defects is efficient and can observe corona photons; and thermal infrared imager can detect the temperature rising caused by Partial discharge. And this result also verified the simulation result that electric field concentration resulted in partial discharge. Test results also show that in short period of time partial discharge changes not much. This is mainly because the energy caused by PD does not accumulate so much in short time. That is contributing to the discovery of potential defects.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Coupling of {{carrier wave}} {{frequencies}} up to 95 kHz (within the European CENELEC A-band) for online diagnostic data transfer in medium voltage cables is studied. Inductive and capacitive signal coupling is considered {{not only on}} basis of technical performance, but also on basis of practical aspects. The effectiveness of coupling schemes depends on the impedances of substation equipment at the <b>cable</b> <b>terminals.</b> The frequency response of a 10 -kV, 400 -kVA three-phase cast resin distribution transformer is investigated. In the frequency range of interest, the behavior is well described by a capacitance of typically 1 nF. The signal transfer over a 4 -km paper cable, terminated by various load impedances to mimic real equipment is studied. From the results it is concluded that for inductive coupling performance within the CENELEC A-band may be sufficient, except for substations {{at the end of}} a grid. Transferring signals containing frequencies up to several megahertz, which is already required for synchronization of partial discharge detection and location equipment, is feasible under all conditions. Measurements on life substations indicate that up to these frequencies substation components can still be accurately modeled as lumped circuit impedances...|$|E
40|$|Cable {{guardrail}} {{systems have}} been increasing in popularity in recent years due to several perceived benefits over the commonly used W-beam guardrail. A non-proprietary design was desired {{as an alternative to}} the many proprietary designs available. A non-proprietary, high-tension <b>cable</b> end <b>terminal</b> was necessary to accompany the non-proprietary, high-tension cable guardrail system under development. The objective of this research project was to develop design recommendations for a non-proprietary, high-tension <b>cable</b> end <b>terminal.</b> An analysis of several <b>cable</b> guardrail end <b>terminals</b> was undertaken to identify any common features that may prove to be beneficial or detrimental to end terminal designs. Next, a study of the non-proprietary low-tension system was conducted to determine the cause of vehicle instabilities in full-scale testing. Since the high-tension and low-tension <b>cable</b> end <b>terminal</b> designs are similar, it is likely that any issues with the low-tension design will also be evident in testing of the high-tension design. LS-DYNA modeling of current <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> anchor hardware was then accomplished and compared to bogie testing results. The anchor model proved to be sufficiently accurate to preliminarily analyze alternative cable anchor designs. A final, optimized, high-tension cable anchor design was produced along with alternative terminal post recommendations for continuing development of the non-proprietary, high-tension <b>cable</b> end <b>terminal.</b> Advisor: John D.

50|$|The crux of {{the matter}} is here, like in the <b>cable</b> <b>terminal,</b> that the inner bore of this bi-manchet is chosen smaller than the {{diameter}} over the cable-insulation.

40|$|In this study, the {{propagation}} of an action potential in a network of excitable elements is studied numerically. The network we consider consists of excitable elements arranged {{in the shape of}} a trifurcated structure having three cables. The system has a branch point, a Y junction, at which the three cables are joined. Two types of external stimulations are considered: a single impulsive stimulation at one of the <b>cable</b> <b>terminals,</b> and a pair of stimuli applied to two different terminals. We have found three basic phases depending on the excitability of the elements for a single external stimulus as follows: (1) signal distributor-as the excitability gets higher, the pulse generated by a stimulus splits into two at the branch point, and two pulses are transmitted to the opposite terminals, (2) propagation block-the pulse in the lower excitable chain is blocked at the branch point, and (3) transient propagation-as the excitability is decreased further, we see that the pulse vanishes before reaching the branch point. By the interaction between the pulses that originate from different sources, signal transmission is recovered if the pulses arrive at the branch point nearly synchronously or after a specific delay time. The effects of the repetition of these two types of stimulation are also investigated. Complex spatiotemporal patterns occur due to pulse-pulse interaction and collisions at the branch point. The input-output relationship, which depends crucially on the repetition period and the time lag between the pair of stimuli, is characterized by the stimulus-response ratio and the interspike interval. We also show the effects of noise on the distribution of the interspike interval...|$|E
30|$|This {{paper is}} {{the first part of}} the {{above-mentioned}} study into wheeled tensegrity robotics. It focuses on the transitional region from tensegrity to a standard fixed mobile frame for wheeled locomotion. To the authors’ knowledge, there is no formal research work done on this area. It firstly introduces criteria of evaluation for a transitional region. Secondly, it reviews some of the available regular configurations of tensegrity structures as a preliminary study. Thirdly, it proposes new conceptual transitional regions to be validated later in the paper. Fourthly, it shows the design and prototype of a novel wheeled tensegrity robot. Finally, it presents discussion and conclusions. As a representative problem that can be solved by a tensegrity-based wheeled robot, we have chosen the mechanical traversal and navigation of ducting networks. Ducting networks in buildings and industrial facilities can span and branch out in any direction in space. Most mobile robots are designed to travel only in a horizontal plane and have difficulty turning in arbitrary directions in three dimensions. Robotic duct climbers are only able to travel in one line and maybe follow the duct mainstream through wide bends. They currently do not have the ability to turn out of the duct into a branch. A robot able to transit through air ducts in houses and buildings will reduce time and number of personnel required as well as increasing flexibility and scope of work done. Due to the geometry and structural integrity of air ducts, flexibility and light weight are required key features. A hybrid wheeled tensegrity design would add speed and efficiency to the features of the robot. Basic work currently carried out in air ducts includes inspection and maintenance. However, in the near future, home automation, pioneered by companies like Apple, Google, and Amazon, will require the installation of <b>cable</b> <b>terminals</b> to power automated air vents. Being able to access areas through complex duct networks will continue to become more relevant.|$|E
40|$|The {{extension}} of the Dutch 380 kV high voltage grid is {{necessary in order to}} guarantee security of electricity supply to the consumers. To achieve this extension, there are two new 380 kV connections under construction in the Randstad area, a densely populated area {{in the western part of}} the Netherlands. In these 380 kV connections, underground cables are applied. The work described in this thesis forms a part of a monitoring program that is managed by the Dutch transmission grid operator TenneT. In this program, the behavior of the two new underground cable connections in the Dutch 380 kV grid is being investigated and the work described in this thesis contributes to this program. Unlike the common overhead transmission line, which has an inductive behavior, a cable acts as a capacitance when it is in operation. This difference in electrical behavior makes research on the grid behavior necessary. One of the research goals is to evaluate whether the power flows and voltage levels in the 380 kV grid stay within the prescribed limits. Another goal of this work is investigating whether the peak of the transient voltages at the <b>cable</b> <b>terminals</b> after lightning currents will stay below the Basic Insulation Level. The research is divided into two parts: steady state behavior and transient behavior. For the steady state part, PI sections are used to model the underground cable and overhead line to perform load flow studies in order to investigate the power flows and voltage levels in the 380 kV grid. For the transient part, the widely applied Frequency Dependent Phase Model (FDPM), which is a transmission line model that takes into account the frequency dependency of cable and line parameters, is used to model the cable and overhead line sections. For the transient part, the focus is on the modeling work of the complete underground cable system. Field measurements are performed for both the 380 kV cross-bonded cable and the overhead line sections and the results are used for transient cable model verification. The scientific contribution of this work is the determination of the parameters for the 380 kV cross bonding system by using reflection measurements and the validation of the FDPM transmission line model by using field measurements on the actual cross bonded 380 kV cable system. Finally, based on the studies described in this thesis, one can conclude that no remarkable overvoltages occur during the studied steady state and transient situations for the given dimensions of the observed 380 kV system.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  6 b, H_ 0 (s), the {{resulting}} current transfer function at the faulted <b>cable</b> <b>terminal,</b> has the {{characteristic of a}} band-pass filter. Since H_ 0 (s) is defined {{with respect to the}} incident voltage wave, it can be considered as an admittance which describes the relationship between the resulting current at the faulted <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> and the incident voltage. This admittance is highly inductive due to the presence of the series inductor and the converter arm inductors. Consequently, high-frequency components of the incident voltage are largely attenuated. In the low frequency region, this admittance is highly capacitive, mainly due to the equivalent converter capacitor. As a result, low-frequency components of the incident voltage are also largely attenuated. The bandwidth and gain of the frequency response of H_ 0 (s) increase as the series inductors decrease.|$|R

50|$|On the Danish side, the {{converter}} station used as well by Konti-Skan 1 and 2 {{is close to}} Vester Hassing near Aalborg. From Vester Hassing a 34 km long overhead line with two conductors runs to the <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> at the Danish coast near Staesnaes. This line, which {{is only in the}} proximity of {{the converter}} station and the <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> equipped with a ground conductor, was originally used by the high voltage pole of Konti-Skan 1 and from Vester Hassing until a point a few kilometres south of the <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> by the electrode line, which turned there eastwards to the ground electrode at Soera. At implementation of Konti-Skan 2 the whole overhead electrode line was replaced by two 27 km long underground cables and the second conductor of the overhead line got the high-voltage pole of Konti-Skan 2. The 23 km long submarine cable to the Danish island of Laeso starts at Stensnaes and consists of 3 parallel cables. Each of these cables has two copper conductors with a copper cross section of 310 square millimeters. One of these cables was used by Kontiskan 1 and one is used by Kontiskan 2. From the third cable, one conductor was used by Kontiskan 1 and the other is used by Kontiskan 2. Konti-Skan crosses Laeso-Island on a 17 km long overhead line with two conductors. Before the implementation of Konti-Skan 2 both conductors were switched parallel, today one conductor is used for the high voltage pole of Konti-Skan 1, while the other is used by that of Konti-Skan 2. Between Laeso and Sweden each high voltage pole of Konti-Skan uses a monopolar copper cable with a cross section of 1200 square millimetres.|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} methodology is used {{to analyse}} the travelling waves in a bipolar configuration with metallic return. First, the mutual coupling, in terms of very fast transient between the two poles is shown to be insignificant. Second, {{the influence of the}} number of the parallel branches in the same pole, is shown to be more pronounced in the low-frequency region, which implies that very fast transients are less influenced by the number of the parallel branches. Third, the series inductor at the <b>cable</b> <b>terminal</b> plays vital role in primary protection algorithms based on local measurements. Large series inductors give large margin in both voltage detection level and the time to identify the faulted cable. Fourth, the grounding impedances in a bipolar system have insignificant influences on the first travelling wave.|$|R
