In 1999 Geva released a film containing testimonies of 13 survivors {{that she and her husband}} Dan had managed to track down from the list in Sefer Hebron ("The Book of Hebron"). Originally intended to document the story of the Arab who had saved Geva's mother from other Arabs, it became also an account of the atrocities of the massacre itself. These survivors, most of whom no longer live in Israel, are mixed as to whether they <b>can</b> <b>forgive.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} context there is {{mention of the}} {{practice}} of indulgences. An indulgence is a remission before God, through the mediation of the Church, of the temporal punishment due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven. Indulgences may be obtained for oneself, or on behalf of the dead. Despite popular perception, the Catholic Church has never taught that indulgences forgive any sins, for this is God's jurisdiction alone. Any persons who have taught that acts of charity such as indulgences <b>can</b> <b>forgive</b> sins have been condemned as heretics by the Catholic Church. It is also a heretical position to suggest that indulgences are applied no matter how weak a Christian may be in his faith. An indulgence (or any act of charity for that matter) is dependent on the present faith of the individual Christian (see Johann Tetzel).|$|E

He and Eleanor {{remained}} married, and he pledged never to see Mercer again. The Roosevelts' son James later described the state of the marriage after the incident as [...] "an armed truce that endured until the day he died". Eleanor later wrote, [...] "I have the memory of an elephant. I <b>can</b> <b>forgive,</b> but never forget." [...] The incident marked a turning point in her life; disillusioned with her marriage, she became active in public life, and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife.|$|E

500|$|Rock 'n' Roll Circus {{received}} mixed to favorable {{reviews from}} most music critics. [...] A staff reviewer from CD Journal praised the album's rock influences, and commended the album's production. Greg from Selective Hearing was positive towards the album. He commented, [...] "This {{was an excellent}} album and I couldn’t think of a single thing that could be wrong. It proves that Ayu is still {{at the top of}} her game." [...] However, he felt that [...] "Last Links", [...] "Lady Dynamite", [...] "Sexy Little Things", [...] "The Meaning Of Love", and [...] "Red Line -for TA-" [...] were the album's, [...] "standard cookie cutter fillers". Asian Junkie editor Random J reviewed the album on his personal blog, and awarded it seven stars. He stated, [...] "Rock 'n Roll Circus feels more accessible and easier to connect with than the likes of Guilty." [...] He later commented, [...] "I think this is one of the few albums where Ayumi Hamasaki sounds comfortable and locked into its sound...

500|$|Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded - The Re-Up {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on eight reviews. David Jeffries of Allmusic opined that [...] "the too-pop [...] now feels more balanced once this eight-track EP worth of material tips the scales", {{adding that the}} additional tracks and DVD is [...] "the better deal and bigger picture" [...] than the original. Dan Weiss of the Boston Phoenix complimented Minaj's rapping, commenting that [...] "the rapper who rhymes [...] "fri-vo-lous" [...] with [...] "po-ly-ga-mist" [...] is X-Acto sharp as ever". The Los Angeles Times Gerrick D. Kennedy noted the variety of genres incorporated in the reissue, stating [...] "Sure, she flirts with dance pop and R balladry, but you <b>can</b> <b>forgive</b> her for wanting to satisfy different tastes. Here, it actually works". Andy Gill of The Independent provided a mixed review, feeling that the material was generic and [...] "does not add much to the Minaj experience". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani criticized the lyrical content and featured guests, adding that [...] "as long as [...] keeps comparing herself to Jesus, we probably shouldn't hold our breath". Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly placed the album at number two on his list of The Worst Albums Of The Year, writing that the album was [...] "soul-less, lazy, and totally unnecessary." ...|$|E

Ranking it as the 77th top SNES game in 2011, IGN commented that while Shadowrun [...] "didn't quite get away from all the common RPG stereotypes" [...] it was still [...] "a milestone for the introduction of film noir style into the gaming industry, though, so we <b>can</b> <b>forgive</b> the game for only being 90% groundbreaking." [...] The game was also cited as an important milestone in the use of film noir style in video games by Game Informer, according to which [...] "Shadowruns moody music and dark streets set the somber tone for this RPG's prying conversations and self-reflective narrative." [...] Game Informer also ranked Shadowrun as 125th place on their list of best video games of all time in 2009. IGN Australia listed Shadowrun among their favourite Australian video games in 2010, writing it was [...] "without question, one of the best underexposed classics of the SNES era" [...] because it presented players with [...] "a mature narrative, strong characters and a dystopian backdrop" [...] blended with traditional RPG elements in an [...] "irresistible" [...] way. That same year, 1UP.com included Shadowrun on their list of 15 games [...] "ahead of their time" [...] for its use of a keyword dialogue system, common to PC games but foreign to console games of the time.|$|E
