50|$|As {{part of the}} International Cooperative Alliance, Cooperatives Europe {{maintains}} the internationally recognised definition of a cooperative in the Statement on the Cooperative Identity which also defines seven cooperative principles. Over time, the international cooperative movement has made small readjustments to this first set of principles of the Rochdale cooperative. The most recent adjustment was made in 1995 at the Centennial Congress of the International Cooperative Alliance, when the seven cooperative principles were approved: voluntary and open membership, democratic member <b>control,</b> <b>member</b> economic participation, autonomy and independence, education, training and information, cooperation among cooperatives, and concern for the community. The new principles, while building on and refining the previously accepted ones, firmly positioned cooperatives as jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprises based on the values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality and solidarity.|$|E
5000|$|Female {{gang members}} can {{function}} {{in one of}} three capacities, as theorized and defined by Walter Miller: independently functioning units, coed gangs, and female auxiliaries to male gangs. [...] Independently functioning units are all-female gangs that operate under their own gang colors and name, without oversight from existing male gangs. Coed gangs possess both male and female members. Most leadership positions are held by males, although Taylor notes that positions and power held by female members varies from gang to gang, and are often dependent on the gang’s structure, most notably whether or not it operates for profit. [...] Female auxiliary gangs adopt the symbols of and modify the name of an existing male gang, but operate semi-autonomously. They act {{in the interests of the}} male gang, but <b>control</b> <b>member</b> initiation and internal affairs of the group.|$|E
