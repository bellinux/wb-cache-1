40|$|Abstract Background <b>Contracting</b> <b>in</b> {{private sector}} is {{promoted}} in developing countries facing human resources shortages {{as a challenge to}} reduce maternal mortality. This study explored provision, practice, performance, barriers to execution and views about <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> specialists for emergency obstetric care (EmOC) in rural India. Methods Facility survey was conducted in all secondary and tertiary public health facilities (44) in three heterogeneous districts in Maharashtra state of India. Interviews (42) were conducted with programme managers and district and block level officials and with public and private EmOC specialists. Locations of private obstetricians in the study districts were identified and mapped. Results Two schemes, namely Janani Suraksha Yojana and Indian Public Health standards (IPHS) provided for <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> EmOC specialists. The IPHS provision was chosen for use mainly due to greater sum for <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> (US $ 30 /service episode vs. 300 US$/month). The positions of EmOC specialists were vacant in 83 % of all facilities that hence had a potential for <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> EmOC specialists. Private specialists were <b>contracted</b> <b>in</b> at 20 % such facilities. The <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> of specialists did not greatly increase EmOC service outputs at facilities, except in facilities with determined leadership. <b>Contracting</b> <b>in</b> specialists was useful for non emergency conditions, but not for obstetric emergencies. The contracts were more of a relational nature with poor monitoring structures. Inadequate infrastructure, longer distance to private specialists, insufficient financial provision for <b>contracting</b> <b>in,</b> and poor management capacities were barriers to effective implementation of <b>contracting</b> <b>in.</b> Dependency on the private sector was a concern among public partners while the private partners viewed <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> as an opportunity to gain experience and credibility. Conclusions Density and geographic distribution of private specialists are important influencing factors in determining feasibility and use of <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> for EmOC. Local circumstances dictate balance between introduction or expansion of contracts with private sector and strengthening public provisions and that neither of these disregard the need to strengthen public systems. Sustainability of <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> arrangements, their effect on increasing coverage of EmOC services in rural areas and overlapping provisions for <b>contracting</b> <b>in</b> EmOC specialists are issues for future consideration. </p...|$|R
50|$|Every {{ordinary}} material will <b>contract</b> <b>in</b> volume when {{put under}} isotropic compression, <b>contract</b> <b>in</b> cross-section area when put under uniform biaxial compression, and <b>contract</b> <b>in</b> length when put into uniaxial compression.
