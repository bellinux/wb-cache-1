5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, the <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E
5|$|The only goal of {{the game}} {{followed}} shortly thereafter. Curtis went on a run for Cardiff, who passed it forward near the box to Ferguson. He shot the ball towards the goal, but it had little power and was easily picked up by Lewis. However, as he did so, the ball squirmed out of Lewis' hands and slipped in between the <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left elbow and body. With a couple of Cardiff City forwards closing in, Lewis tried to reclaim the ball but only succeeded in knocking it into the net with his elbow. Arsenal sought to attack immediately after the kick off, but despite it looking promising, Brain was caught offside. Cardiff countered, and possibly {{could have had a}} second goal, but Curtis chose to shoot himself rather than pass to Davies, who would have been presented with an open goal had he received the ball as Lewis was out of position. The match ended with a victory for Cardiff City by one goal to nil. The King presented the trophy to Cardiff's captain Keenor, and medals to each of the players from both teams.|$|E

5000|$|The {{background}} to Koestler’s collaboration {{in the writing}} of these books is set out in detail in his autobiography The Invisible Writing, Chapter XIX. ‘Introducing Dr. Coster’. As noted there, The Encyclopœdia was highly successful and became a best-seller in several languages, but Koestler himself had little benefit of it, being shamelessly exploited by the publisher [...] - [...] a <b>crooked</b> cousin <b>of</b> <b>his.</b> Koestler received a flat payment of sixty pounds and no royalties from the sales, which amounted to tens of thousands.|$|R

50|$|The sept-et-le-va (seven and the go): {{the first}} great chance that showed the {{advantages}} of the game, namely, if the player had won the couch, and then made a paroli by <b>crooking</b> the corner <b>of</b> <b>his</b> card, and going on to a second chance, if his winning card turned up again, it became a sept-et-le-va, which was seven times as much as he had laid upon his card.|$|R

60|$|A gasp of relief, {{followed}} by an angry cry from Valentina, went up when they recognised those that came. First stepped the Count of Aquila in full armour, sword at side and dagger on hip, carrying his head-piece on the <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left arm. Behind him towered the bulk of Fortemani, his great face flushed with a strange excitement, a leather hacketon over his steel cuirass, girt, too, with sword and dagger, and carrying his shining morion in his hand. Last came Lanciotto and Zaccaria, both fully equipped and armed at all points.|$|E
50|$|St Matthias Old Church {{is located}} on Poplar High Street, {{opposite}} Tower Hamlets College.

60|$|From these Indians he {{received}} information that several white men {{had gone down}} the river, some one side, and a good many on the other; these last he concluded to be Mr. Crooks and his party.

60|$|And {{already the}} last sea-fight of Carthage was coming swiftly {{to an end}} before them. Under their very eyes the two Roman galleys had shot in, one {{on either side of}} the vessel of Black Magro. They had grappled with him, and he, desperate in his despair, had cast the <b>crooked</b> flukes <b>of</b> <b>his</b> anchors over their gunwales, and bound them to him in an iron grip, whilst with hammer and crowbar he burst great holes in his own sheathing. The last Punic galley should never be rowed into Ostia, a sight for the holiday-makers of Rome. She would lie in her own waters. And the fierce, dark soul of her rover captain glowed as he thought that not alone should she sink into the depths of the mother sea.|$|R
60|$|The clerk {{wrote the}} number of a room against Lemuel's name in the register, and then glanced at the bag. It was a large bag of oil- cloth, a kind of bag which is by nature lank and hollow, and must be made almost insupportably heavy before it shows any signs of repletion. The shirt and pair of {{everyday}} pantaloons which Lemuel had dropped that morning into its voracious maw made no apparent effect there, as the clerk held it up and twirled it on the <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> thumb.|$|E
6000|$|The {{three men}} {{in command of}} the machine were set apart as [...] "the threshers."--William and David {{alternately}} [...] "fed" [...] or [...] "tended," [...] that is, one of them [...] "fed" [...] the grain into the howling cylinder while the other, oil-can in hand, watched the sieves, felt of the pinions and so kept the machine in good order. The feeder's position was the high place to which all boys aspired, and on this day I stood in silent admiration of Uncle David's easy powerful attitudes as he caught each bundle in the <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arm and spread it out into a broad, smooth band of yellow straw on which the whirling teeth caught and tore with monstrous fury. He was the ideal man in my eyes, grander in some ways than my father, {{and to be able to}} stand where he stood was the highest honor in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{a really}} good fellow," [...] went on Marlow. [...] "And his {{capacity}} for astonishment is quickly exhausted, it seems. It was in the most matter-of-fact manner that he said, `Come on board of me, then; I have here enough supper for two.' He was holding a bulky parcel in the <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arm. I did not wait to be asked twice, as you may guess. His cutter has a very neat little cabin, quite big enough for two men not only to sleep but to sit and smoke in. We left the scuttle wide open, of course. As to his provisions for supper, they were not of a luxurious kind. He complained that the shops in the village were miserable. There was a big village within a mile and a half. It struck me he had been very long doing his shopping; but naturally I made no remark. I didn't want to talk at all except for the purpose of setting him going." ...|$|E
60|$|Not less natural was the presence, in Ramsgate, of Billy Towler. We {{have already}} {{mentioned}} that, for peculiarly <b>crooked</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own, Morley Jones {{had changed his}} abode to Ramsgate--his country abode, that is. His headquarters and town department continued as before to flourish in Gravesend, {{in the form of}} a public-house, which had once caught fire at a time, strange to say, when the spirit and beer casks were all nearly empty, a curious fact which the proprietor alone was aware of, but thought it advisable not to mention when he went to receive the 200 pounds of insurance which had been effected on the premises a few weeks before! It will thus be seen that Mr Jones's assurance, in the matter of dealing with insurance, was considerable.|$|R
60|$|Much mighty speech-making {{there has}} been, {{both in and}} out of Parliament, {{concerning}} Tom, and much wrathful disputation how Tom shall be got right.

In the midst of which dust and noise there is but one thing perfectly clear, to wit, that Tom only may and can, or shall and will, be reclaimed according to somebody's theory but nobody's practice. And in the hopeful meantime, Tom goes to perdition head foremost in his old determined spirit.|$|R
