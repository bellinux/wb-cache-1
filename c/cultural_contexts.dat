Brown’s position on tourism in Hawaii, made public at the 1984 Governor’s Tourism Conference, represents a key statement for the role of tourism in the state.|$|E

25|$|Late in the 1930s, Codreanu's {{supporters}} began publishing books praising his virtues, {{among which}} are Vasile Marin's Crez de Generație ("Generation Credo") and Nicolae Roșu's Orientări în Veac ("Orientations in the Century"), both published in 1937. After the National Legionary State officially hailed Corneliu Zelea Codreanu as a martyr to the cause, his image {{came to be}} used as a propaganda tool in <b>cultural</b> <b>contexts.</b> Codreanu was integrated into the Legionary cult of death: usually at Iron Guard rallies, Codreanu and other fallen members were mentioned and greeted with the shout Prezent! ("Present!"). His personality cult was reflected into Legionary art, and a stylized image of him was displayed at major rallies, including the notorious and large-scale Bucharest ceremony of October 6, 1940. Although Codreanu was officially condemned by the communist regime a generation later, it is possible that, in its final stage under Nicolae Ceaușescu, it came to use the Captain's personality cult as a source of inspiration. The post-communist Noua Dreaptă, which publicizes portraits of Codreanu in the form of Orthodox icons, often makes use of such representation in its public rallies, usually associating it with its own symbol, the Celtic cross.|$|E

His scholarly books on schizophrenia also highlighted the human costs of the disorder. In Schizophrenia Genesis: The Origins of Madness, he provided chapters in which patients describe their experiences of the disease, and those of their families. Gottesman emphasized that genetics influences patients' behavior {{in concert with the}} family, social, economic, and <b>cultural</b> <b>contexts.</b> Gottesman also highlighted random events as an important [...] "third element" [...] determining behavior and what unfolds as apparent destiny.

500|$|Cultural theorist Mark Fisher {{characterized}} {{a variety}} of musical developments in the late 1970s, including post-punk, industrial music, synthpop, and particularly the work of German electronic band Kraftwerk, as situated within art pop traditions. He states that Bowie and Roxy Music's English style of art pop [...] "culminated" [...] with {{the music of the}} British group Japan. The Quietus characterized Japan's 1979 album Quiet Life as defining [...] "a very European form of detached, sexually-ambiguous and thoughtful art-pop" [...] similar to that explored by Bowie on 1977's Low. Brian Eno and John Cale would serve a crucial part in the careers of Bowie, Talking Heads, and many key punk and post-punk records. [...] Following the amateurism of the punk movement, post-punk era saw a return to the art school tradition previously embodied by the work of Bowie and Roxy Music, with artists drawing ideas from literature, art, cinema, and critical theory into musical and pop <b>cultural</b> <b>contexts</b> while refusing the common distinction between high art and low culture. An emphasis on multimedia performance and visual art became common.|$|E
