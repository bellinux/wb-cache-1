The Guam Memorial Hospital sustained about $1million in damage from storm-related flooding. High winds left about 40% of Guam without power, mostly {{in the north and}} central portions of the island, although the outages were fixed within a few days. The power outages also disrupted generators for water wells, leaving 3,300people without access to clean water; residents in some areas were under a boil-water advisory. Utility damage was estimated at $3million. Businesses sustained $1.9million in damage. Dolphin also caused $1.2million worth of crop damage. The typhoon damaged over 7,000banana trees as well as 39 of the endangered ironwood trees. Rough waves sank a boat at Apra Harbor, requiring workers to <b>clean</b> <b>oil</b> that escaped from the damaged vessel. Dolphin damaged 390houses across Guam, of which 9 were destroyed and another 55 were severely damaged. This left 1,055people homeless, mostly in the towns of Yigo or Dededo. Overall damage was estimated at nearly $10million, prompting Governor Eddie Calvo to declare a state of emergency. On June5, President Barack Obama signed a major disaster declaration for the territory, allowing for federal aid to be used. Ultimately, the government provided about $4.7million in aid, mostly in public assistance. A federal grant provided 220temporary jobs toward cleaning and repairing damage.|$|E

50|$|Hydraulic tappets are tappets {{that contain}} a small {{hydraulic}} piston, pressurised by the engine's lubricating oil supply. Although the piston {{does not move}} appreciably or frequently, it acts as a hydraulic spring that automatically adjusts the tappet clearance according to the oil pressure. This makes the valve actuation self-adjusting {{and there is no}} need to adjust the rockers. Hydraulic tappets depend on a supply of <b>clean</b> <b>oil</b> at the appropriate pressure. When starting a cold engine, with low oil pressure, hydraulic tappets are often noisy for a few seconds, until they position themselves correctly.|$|E

Haldor Topsøe’s catalysts and technologies are used to <b>clean</b> <b>oil</b> and ensure more environmentally friendly fuels, for cleaning power industry flue gasses, for converting hydrocarbon feedstocks such as natural gas and LPG into ammonia, hydrogen and methanol, and for reducing emission from heavy duty vehicles.

50|$|The T20 solves {{this problem}} by {{incorporating}} a once-through oil injection system known as Posi-Force, which consists of an engine-driven oil pump coupled to the throttle, {{which is designed to}} provide the proper amount of oil needed at the current RPM and throttle opening. The pump draws <b>clean</b> <b>oil</b> from a separate oil tank, and pumps it through hoses into the crankcase, where it is injected into the engine from a nozzle located between the intake manifold and the cylinder. A separate oil injection point is also provided for the main bearing(s) and big end rod bearings of the crankshaft. This dual-point injection made the Posi-Force system far superior to the competitions' single point per cylinder systems. Suzuki would continue to use this system on many of their two-stroke motorcycle designs for many years.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the first}} commercially {{available}} cat litters in the United States of America was Kitty Litter, available in 1947 and marketed by Ed Lowe. This was the first large-scale use of clay (in the form of Fuller's earth) in litter boxes; previously sand was used. Clay litter is much more absorbent than sand and is manufactured into large grains or clumps of clay to make it {{less likely to be}} tracked from the litter box. The brand name Kitty Litter has become a genericized trademark, used by many to denote any type of cat litter. Today, cat litter can be obtained quite economically at a variety of retail stores.Conventional clay litter is indistinguishable from clay-based oil absorbent (used to <b>clean</b> <b>oil</b> spills); as the latter is far less expensive, it is often used as a substitute. Non-clumping cat litter is often made of zeolite, diatomite and sepiolite.|$|E
5000|$|Aside from {{publicly}} humiliating Hickok {{and taking}} his property, Tutt's demand for collateral on a debt from a fellow professional card player implied he thought Hickok was an insolvent gambler {{trying to avoid}} his debts. To ignore such an insult from Tutt would have ruined Hickok's career as a gambler in Springfield, which was reportedly his only source of income. Further, groups of Tutt's friends reportedly continued to mock Hickok after the initial confrontation, baiting him with talk of the pocket watch {{to see if he}} could be goaded into drawing in anger so he could be shot down by the whole group. After several days of this, Hickok's patience was at its breaking point. When a group of Tutt's supporters at the Lyon House mocked Hickok and announced that they had heard Tutt was planning to wear the watch [...] "in the middle of the town square" [...] the next day, Hickok reportedly replied, [...] "He shouldn't come across that square unless dead men can walk." [...] Having apparently made up his mind, Hickok returned to his room to <b>clean,</b> <b>oil</b> and reload his pistols in anticipation of a confrontation with Tutt the next morning.|$|E

50|$|Biomining is a {{technique}} of extracting metals from ores and other solid materials typically using prokaryotes or fungi. These organisms secrete different organic compounds that chelate metals from the environment {{and bring it back}} to the cell where they are typically used to coordinate electrons. It was discovered in the mid 1900's that microorganisms use metals in the cell. Some microbes can use stable metals such as iron, copper, zinc, and gold as well as unstable atoms such as uranium and thorium. Companies can now grow large chemostats of microbes that are leaching metals from their media, these vats of culture can then be transformed into many marketable metal compounds. Biomining is an environmentally friendly technique compared to typical mining. Mining releases many pollutants while the only chemicals released from biomining is any metabolites or gasses that the bacteria secrete. The same concept can be used for bioremediation models. Bacteria can be inoculated into environments contaminated with metals, oils, or other toxic compounds. The bacteria can clean the environment by absorbing these toxic compounds to create energy in the cell. Microbes can achieve things at a chemical level that could never be done by humans. Bacteria can mine for metals, <b>clean</b> <b>oil</b> spills, purify gold, and use radioactive elements for energy.|$|E
