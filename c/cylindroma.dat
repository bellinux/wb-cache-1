40|$|BACKGROUND: Familial cylindromatosis {{is a rare}} genetic disorder, {{giving rise}} to {{neoplasms}} of the skin appendages. We have recently shown that loss of the cylindromatosis tumour suppressor gene leads to activation of NF-kappaB, a transcription factor having antiapoptotic activity.

40|$|Hereditary cylindromatosis {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} dominant disease characterised {{by the development of}} multiple benign neoplasms of the skin. We recently localised the gene responsible for this disease (cyld 1) to chromosome 16 q 12 -q 13 and provided evidence that it is a tumour suppressor gene. We have now examined polymorphic markers on every chromosome, some of which are close to known tumour suppressor genes, in 25 tumours from 4 individuals with familial cylindromatosis. No loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was detected other than at loci on chromosome 16 q. This observation suggests that the cyld 1 gene may be the only tumour suppressor gene implicated in the development of <b>cylindromas.</b> We have also demonstrated LOH using markers on chromosome 16 q in 8 / 14 (57 %) sporadic <b>cylindromas,</b> indicating that the cyld 1 gene is likely {{to be involved in the}} genesis of both familial and sporadic <b>cylindromas...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Cylindroma</b> of {{the breast}} is a very rare lesion which is {{morphological}} and immunophenotypically identical to benign dermal <b>cylindroma.</b> We report a breast <b>cylindroma</b> in a previously healthy 62 year old female detected through a national breast screening program.

The tumor consisted of well circumscribed islands of epithelial cells surrounded by a dense membrane material, and focally containing hyaline globules. At low power the islands of tumour cells formed a "jig-saw" pattern, which is typical of <b>cylindroma,</b> but was present within normal breast parenchyma and no had direct connection with the overlying skin. Two distinct cell populations, smaller peripheral basaloid cells and larger central cells with vesicular chromatin, were highlighted by immunohistochemistry for p 63 and cytokeratin- 7 respectively.

40|$|Aim-The {{gene for}} {{familial}} cylindromatosis (CYLD) has been localised to chromosome 16 q, and {{has recently been}} cloned. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 16 q has also been demonstrated in sporadic <b>cylindromas.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether CYLD plays a role in the development of other skin appendage tumours. Methods-A total of 55 cases of skin adnexal tumours, comprising 12 different types, and a control group of 14 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) were studied. Three microsatellites (D 16 S 407 (16 p), D 16 S 304 (16 q), and D 16 S 308 (16 q)) were analysed for LOH after microdissection from paraffin wax embedded sections using laser capture microdissection. Results-In keeping with previous data, a proportion of <b>cylindromas</b> exhibited LOH at markers on 16 q, but not at 16 p. The skin adnexal tumours showing a similar pattern included apocrine hydrocystomas, eccrine spiradenomas, and sebaceous adenoma. One case of syringoma showed LOH at 16 q, and a further case at 16 p, but not 16 q. One case of eccrine hydrocystoma showed loss at 16 p, but not 16 q. The remaining tumours were either negative or non-informative. All tumours in the control group were either negative or non-informative, except for a single case of BCC showing LOH at 16 q.

40|$|Background: Germ-line {{mutations}} in CYLD {{are found in}} patients with familial skin appendage tumours. The protein product functions as a deubiquitinase enzyme, which negatively regulates NF-kappa B and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signalling. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome (BSS) is characterised by <b>cylindromas,</b> trichoepitheliomas and spiradenomas, whereas in familial cylindromatosis (FC) patients present with <b>cylindromas</b> and in multiple familial trichoepitheliomas (MFT) with trichoepitheliomas as the only skin tumour type. Although described as distinct entities, recent studies suggest that they are within the spectrum of a single entity. Objective: To investigate the mutation spectrum of CYLD and possible genotype-phenotype correlations. Methods: 25 families including 13 BSS, 3 FC, and 9 MFT families were examined and evaluated for {{mutations in}} the CYLD gene. Results: In total, 18 mutations in CYLD, including 6 novel mutations, were identified in 25 probands (72 %). The mutation frequencies among distinct phenotypes were 85 % for BSS, 100 % for FC, and 44 % for MFT. The majority of the mutations were insertions, deletions or nonsense mutations leading to formation of truncated proteins. All mutations were located between exons 9 to 20, encoding the NEMO binding site and the catalytic domain. Genotype-phenotype analysis failed to reveal a correlation between the types of mutations and their location within the gene and the patients` phenotypes and disease severity. Conclusions: This study provides further evidence {{on the role of}} CYLD in the pathogenesis of skin appendage tumours characterised by <b>cylindromas,</b> trichoepitheliomas and/or spiradenomas, but the molecular mechanisms of CYLD in skin tumorigenesis and the reasons for phenotypic variability remain to be explored...|$|R
40|$|CYLD is a {{tumor-suppressor gene}} mutated {{in the skin}} {{appendage}} tumors <b>cylindromas,</b> trichoepitheliomas, and spiradenomas. We have performed in vivo metastasis assays in nude mice {{and found that the}} loss of the deubiquitinase function of CYLD in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells greatly enhances the lung metastatic capability of these cells. These metastases showed several characteristics that make them distinguishable from those carrying a functional CYLD, such as robust angiogenesis, increased expression of tumor malignancy markers of SCCs, and a decrease in the expression of the suppressor of metastasis Maspin. Restoration of Maspin expression in the epidermal SCC cells defective in CYLD deubiquitination function significantly reduces their ability to form metastases, thereby suggesting that the decrease in the levels of Maspin expression {{plays an important role in}} the acquisition of metastatic potential of these cells. In addition, we have characterized Maspin downregulation in <b>cylindromas,</b> trichoepitheliomas, and spiradenomas carrying functional inactivating mutations of CYLD, also providing an evidence of the correlation between impaired CYLD function and Maspin decreased expression in vivo in human tumors...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{germline}} {{mutations in}} the {{tumour suppressor gene}} CYLD develop multiple cutaneous tumours {{on the head and}} neck; historically this has been termed “turban tumour” syndrome. <b>Cylindromas</b> and spiradenomas, hair follicle related tumours seen in this syndrome, cause significant clinical morbidity. Here we characterise the clinical phenotype of these patients, utilising tumour mapping to determine the location of tumours in mutation carriers from two large pedigrees. We demonstrate the disease often affects sites outwith the head and neck, and that androgen stimulated hair follicles are particularly vulnerable to tumour formation. The impact of this disease is severe, with 1 in 4 carriers of this gene undergoing complete scalp removal. To improve this outcome, we performed whole genome profiling of CYLD defective tumours, characterising genomic and transcriptomic changes to determine targetable signalling pathways. High resolution analysis using whole genome array based comparative genomic hybridisation and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis suggest that loss of heterozygosity at the CYLD locus may be the only change required for tumour phenotype. Gene expression profiling highlighted transcriptomic similarity between <b>cylindromas</b> and spiradenomas. Threedimensional reconstruction in silico from serial sections of tumours demonstrated contiguous growth between <b>cylindromas</b> and spiradenomas, in support of this finding. In both tumour types, dysregulated tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) signalling was found. Consistent with this, was the finding that TRKB and TRKC protein was overexpressed selectively in the tumour samples, demonstrated on a tissue microarray. Therapeutic utility of targeting this pathway was demonstrated by reduced viability of CYLD defective primary cell cultures in the presence of TRK inhibitors. These preliminary data support the use of TRK inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy in severely affected CYLD mutation carriers.
