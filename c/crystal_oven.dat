50|$|A common {{temperature}} for a <b>crystal</b> <b>oven</b> is 75 °C. but may vary between 30 - 80 °C depending on setup.|$|E
5000|$|Quartz {{chronometers}} {{designed as}} time standards often include a <b>crystal</b> <b>oven,</b> {{to keep the}} crystal at a constant temperature. Some self-rate and include [...] "crystal farms," [...] so that the clock can take the average {{of a set of}} time measurements.|$|E
50|$|Transmitters use highly stable <b>crystal</b> <b>ovens</b> {{as their}} primary {{oscillator}} and frequency synthesisers to generate multiple channels from this.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Crystal</b> <b>Ovens.</b> Ovens {{accommodate}} temperature-sensitive nonlinear crystals. They {{are used}} for precise temperature stabilization of laser harmonic crystals of various sizes, and for heating of both bulk and thin periodically poled crystals.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Some of the {{earliest}} <b>crystal</b> <b>ovens.</b> These precision 100 kHz <b>oven</b> controlled <b>crystal</b> oscillators at the US Bureau of Standards (now NIST) served as the frequency standard for the United States in 1929.|$|R
50|$|In 1764 King Louis XV of France gave {{permission}} {{to found a}} glassworks {{in the town of}} Baccarat in the Lorraine region in eastern France to Prince Bishop Cardinal Louis-Joseph de Laval-Montmorency (1710-1802). Production consisted of window panes, mirrors and stemware until 1816 when the first <b>crystal</b> <b>oven</b> went into operation. By that time over 3000 workers were employed at the site.|$|E
50|$|Quartz watch {{manufacturers}} use {{a simplified}} {{version of the}} Oven-Controlled Crystal Oscillator method by recommending that their watches be worn regularly to ensure best performance. Regular wearing of a quartz watch significantly reduces the magnitude of environmental temperature swings, since a correctly designed watch case forms an expedient <b>crystal</b> <b>oven</b> that uses the stable temperature {{of the human body}} to keep the crystal in its most accurate temperature range.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>crystal</b> <b>oven</b> is a {{temperature-controlled}} chamber used {{to maintain}} the quartz crystal in electronic crystal oscillators at a constant temperature, {{in order to prevent}} changes in the frequency due to variations in ambient temperature. An oscillator of this type is known as an oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO, where [...] "XO" [...] is an old abbreviation for [...] "crystal oscillator".) This type of oscillator achieves the highest frequency stability possible with a crystal. They are typically used to control the frequency of radio transmitters, cellular base stations, military communications equipment, and for precision frequency measurement.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the thermal}} {{stability}} characterization of <b>crystal</b> <b>ovens</b> {{used in a}} phase noise measurement system of ultra-low noise crystal resonators is proposed. This bench is dedicated to test 5 MHz and 10 MHz crystal devices packaged in HC 40 enclosures. New double ovens {{have been designed to}} improve the ultimate noise floor of our carrier suppression bench. A brief description of the temperature environment and processing are given. In addition, experiments to measure the thermal stability of the oven control are given. These new <b>crystal</b> <b>ovens</b> present an Allan standard deviation of about 2 ⋅ 10 - 15 at 1 s in terms of relative frequency fluctuations...|$|R
50|$|<b>Crystal</b> <b>ovens</b> {{are also}} used in optics. In {{crystals}} used for nonlinear optics, the frequency is also sensitive to temperature and thus they require temperature stabilization, especially as the laser beam heats up the crystal. Additionally fast retuning of the crystal is often employed. For this application, the crystal and the thermistor {{need to be in}} very close contact and both must have as low a heat capacity as possible. To avoid breaking the crystal, large temperature variations in short times must be avoided.|$|R
30|$|The Sr-TBC was {{synthesized}} by solvothermal method. Eighty-millilitre DMF {{was transferred}} into a round bottom flask. Subsequently, Sr(NO 3) 2 (0.012  mol) and 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrabenzenecarboxylic acid (0.012  mol) were dissolved in DMF by mild stirring. The solution was refluxed for 2  h at 120  °C while stirring. White crystals were obtained and isolated by centrifuge and washed with methanol to remove excess DMF. The obtained <b>crystals</b> were <b>oven</b> dried at 40  °C for 30  min {{and used for}} further experiments.|$|R
5000|$|The {{accuracy}} of a frequency counter is strongly {{dependent on the}} stability of its timebase. A timebase is very delicate like the hands of a watch, and can be changed by movement, interference, or even drift due to age, meaning it might not [...] "tick" [...] correctly. This can make a frequency reading, when referenced to the timebase, seem higher or lower than the actual value. Highly accurate circuits are used to generate timebases for instrumentation purposes, usually using a quartz crystal oscillator within a sealed temperature-controlled chamber, known as an oven controlled crystal oscillator or <b>crystal</b> <b>oven.</b>|$|E
50|$|Quartz has {{the further}} {{advantage}} that its elastic constants and its size change {{in such a}} way that the frequency dependence on temperature can be very low. The specific characteristics depend on the mode of vibration and the angle at which the quartz is cut (relative to its crystallographic axes). Therefore, the resonant frequency of the plate, which depends on its size, does not change much. This means that a quartz clock, filter or oscillator remains accurate. For critical applications the quartz oscillator is mounted in a temperature-controlled container, called a <b>crystal</b> <b>oven,</b> and can also be mounted on shock absorbers to prevent perturbation by external mechanical vibrations.|$|E
50|$|The {{modulated}} signal {{is applied to}} a mixer (also known as frequency converter). Another input to the mixer which is usually produced in a <b>crystal</b> <b>oven</b> oscillator is known as subcarrier. The two outputs of the mixer are the sum and difference of two signals. Unwanted signal (usually the sum) is filtered out and the remaining signal is the radio frequency (RF) signal. Then the signal {{is applied to the}} amplifier stages. The number of series amplifiers depends on the required output power. The final stage is usually an amplifier consisting of many parallel power transistors. But in older transmitters tetrodes or klystrons are also utilized.|$|E
30|$|The La-TBC was {{synthesized}} by solvothermal method. Eighty-millilitre DMF {{was transferred}} into a round bottom flask. Subsequently, (0.012  mol) La(NO 3) 3 · 6 H 2 O and (0.012  mol) 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrabenzenecarboxylic acid were dissolved in DMF by mild stirring. The solution was refluxed for 2  h at 120  °C while stirring. White crystals were obtained and isolated by centrifuge and washed with methanol to remove excess DMF. The obtained <b>crystals</b> were <b>oven</b> dried at 40  °C for 30  min {{and used for}} further experiments.|$|R
30|$|The Sb-TBC was {{synthesized}} by solvothermal method. Eighty-millilitre DMF {{was transferred}} into a round bottom flask. Subsequently, K 2 Sb 2 (C 4 H 2 O 6) 2 · 3 H 2 O (0.012  mol) and 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrabenzenecarboxylic acid (0.012  mol) were dissolved in DMF by mild stirring. The solution was refluxed for 2  h at 120  °C while stirring. White crystals were obtained and isolated by centrifuge and washed with methanol to remove excess DMF, the obtained <b>crystals</b> were <b>oven</b> dried at 40  °C for 30  min {{and used for}} further experiments.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} concerns {{an amendment}} to a partner project agreement with the ISTC, namely the Partner Project Agreement 1718 p for "Technology Reliability Demonstration and Precise CMS Electromagnetic Calorimetry Performance at LHC on a Base of Specified Tungstate (PbWO 4) Scintillation Crystals". This Partner Project was approved by Council on 17 December 1999 (cf. CERN/ 2312). For reasons set out in this document the Finance Committee is invited to authorise CERN to negotiate {{an amendment to}} the Partner Project Agreement 1718 p. The purpose of the amendment is to increase the production rate of crystals through the acquisition, installation and commissioning of 33 additional <b>crystal</b> growth <b>ovens</b> for a total amount of 1 500 000 US dollars...|$|R
50|$|Temperature {{influences}} the operating frequency; {{various forms of}} compensation are used, from analog compensation (TCXO) and microcontroller compensation (MCXO) to stabilization of the temperature with a <b>crystal</b> <b>oven</b> (OCXO). The crystals possess temperature hysteresis; the frequency at a given temperature achieved by increasing the temperature is not equal to the frequency on the same temperature achieved by decreasing the temperature. The temperature sensitivity depends primarily on the cut; the temperature compensated cuts are chosen as to minimize frequency/temperature dependence. Special cuts {{can be made with}} linear temperature characteristics; the LC cut is used in quartz thermometers. Other influencing factors are the overtone used, the mounting and electrodes, impurities in the crystal, mechanical strain, crystal geometry, rate of temperature change, thermal history (due to hysteresis), ionizing radiation, and drive level.|$|E
50|$|Crystals undergo slow gradual {{change of}} {{frequency}} with time, known as aging. There are many mechanisms involved. The mounting and contacts may undergo relief of the built-in stresses. Molecules of contamination either from the residual atmosphere, outgassed from the crystal, electrodes or packaging materials, or introduced during sealing the housing can be adsorbed on the crystal surface, changing its mass; this effect is exploited in quartz crystal microbalances. The composition of the crystal can be gradually altered by outgassing, diffusion of atoms of impurities or migrating from the electrodes, or the lattice can be damaged by radiation. Slow chemical reactions may occur on or in the crystal, or on the inner surfaces of the enclosure. Electrode material, e.g. chromium or aluminium, can react with the crystal, creating layers of metal oxide and silicon; these interface layers can undergo changes in time. The pressure in the enclosure can change due to varying atmospheric pressure, temperature, leaks, or outgassing of the materials inside. Factors outside of the crystal itself are e.g. aging of the oscillator circuitry (and e.g. change of capacitances), and drift of parameters of the <b>crystal</b> <b>oven.</b> External atmosphere composition can also influence the aging; hydrogen can diffuse through nickel housing. Helium can cause similar issues when it diffuses through glass enclosures of rubidium standards.|$|E
50|$|Rakon Limited is a {{technology}} company founded in 1967 that designs and manufactures frequency control products, primarily quartz crystals and temperature-compensated <b>crystal</b> oscillators (TCXO), <b>oven</b> controlled <b>crystal</b> oscillators (OCXO) and voltage controlled crystal oscillators (VCXO). Its head office is in Auckland, New Zealand with wholly owned subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and France with joint venture operations in India and China. The company specialises in supplying frequency-control {{products to the}} GPS industry.|$|R
5000|$|Placing the {{oscillator}} in a temperature-controlled [...] "oven" [...] at {{a constant}} but higher-than-ambient temperature {{is another way to}} stabilize oscillator frequency. High stability crystal oscillator references often place the <b>crystal</b> in an <b>oven</b> and use a voltage input for fine control. The temperature is selected to be the turnover temperature: the temperature where small changes do not affect the resonance. The control voltage can be used to occasionally adjust the reference frequency to a NIST source. Sophisticated designs may also adjust the control voltage over time to compensate for crystal aging.|$|R
