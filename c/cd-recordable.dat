25|$|The CD {{was planned}} to be the {{successor}} of the vinyl record for playing music, rather than primarily as a data storage medium. From its origins as a musical format, CDs have grown to encompass other applications. In 1983, following the CD's introduction, Immink and Braat presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd AES Convention. In June 1985, the computer-readable CD-ROM (read-only memory) and, in 1990, <b>CD-Recordable</b> were introduced, also developed by both Sony and Philips. Recordable CDs were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without defects introduced in compression used in other digital recording methods. Other newer video formats such as DVD and Blu-ray use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are backward compatible with audio CD.|$|E
5000|$|Optical device speeds {{are often}} quoted as a {{multiple}} of a [...] "basic speed" [...] for that type of device. Thus for CD, the basic speed is 150 kB/s, so a <b>CD-recordable</b> device may be quoted as [...] "4x" [...] or [...] "6x" [...] to indicate a speed of 600 kB/s and 900 kB/s respectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>CD-Recordable</b> drives {{are often}} sold with three {{different}} speed ratings, one speed for write-once operations, one for re-write operations, and one for read-only operations. The speeds are typically listed in that order; i.e. a 12×/10×/32× CD drive can, CPU and media permitting, write to CD-R discs at 12× speed (1.76 MiB/s), write to CD-RW discs at 10× speed (1.46 MiB/s), and read from CDs at 32× speed (4.69 MiB/s).|$|E

He was the world's first CD-ROM producer, launched the first <b>CD-Recordable</b> system which began the [...] "user generated content" [...] revolution, and has developed new technologies in other areas including live webcasting, use of audio and video on the internet, and intellectual property.|$|E

5000|$|Error {{correction}} allows digital formats {{to tolerate}} {{quite a bit}} more media deterioration than analog formats. That is not to say poorly produced digital media are immune to data loss. Laser rot was most troublesome to the Laserdisc format, but also occurs to some pressed commercial CDs, and was caused in both cases by inadequate disc manufacture. [...] There can occasionally be difficulties related to the use of consumer recordable/rewritable compact discs. This may be due to poor-quality CD recorder drives, low-quality discs, or incorrect storage, as the information-bearing dye layer of most <b>CD-recordable</b> discs is at least slightly sensitive to UV light and will be slowly bleached out if exposed to any amount of it. Most digital recordings rely at least to some extent on computational encoding and decoding and so may become completely unplayable if not enough consecutive good data is available for the decoder to synchronize to the digital data stream, whereas any intact segment of any size of an analog recording is playable.|$|E
40|$|When {{faith is}} {{all they have to}} go on when entrusting {{important}} data to optical storage and archival systems, users are not well served. Is the information being recorded correctly? Can it be read? Will it last? By shining some light into the elements of the special writing technique known as Running Optimum Power Control (Running OPC), I hope to establish increased faith in <b>CD-Recordable</b> (CD-R) and well founded confidence that recordings will live up to the legitimate expectations of the user. If you have any suggestions that might improve the usefulness or accuracy of this whit...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1995 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaThe Telemetry Data Distribution System (TDDS) {{solves the}} need to record, archive, and {{distribute}} sounding rocket and satellite data on a compact, user-friendly medium, such as <b>CD-Recordable</b> discs. The TDDS also archives telemetry data on floppy disks, nine-track tapes, and magneto-optical disc cartridges. The PC-based, semi-automated, TDDS digitizes, time stamps, formats, and archives frequency modulated (FM) or pulse code modulated (PCM) telemetry data. An analog tape or a real-time signal may provide the telemetry data source. The TDDS accepts IRIG A, B, G, H, and NASA 36 analog code sources for time stamp data. The output time tag includes time, frame, and subframe status information. Telemetry data may be time stamped based upon a user-specified number of frames, subframes, or words. Once recorded, the TDDS performs data quality testing, formatting, and validation and logs the results automatically. Telemetry data is quality checked to ensure a good analog source track was selected. Raw telemetry data is formatted by dividing the data into records and appending header information. The formatted telemetry data is validated by checking consecutive time tags and subframe identification counter values (if applicable) to identify data drop-outs. After validation, the TDDS archives the formatted data {{to any of the}} following media types: <b>CD-Recordable</b> (CD-R) Disc (650 megabytes capacity); nine track tape (180 megabytes capacity); and erasable optical disc (499 megabytes capacity). Additionally, previously archived science data may be re-formatted and archived to a different output media...|$|E
40|$|The bulk of {{the work}} leading to this ECMA Standard {{was done by the}} Frankfurt Group, which was formed in 1990 by many CD-ROM and CD-WO {{hardware}} and media manufacturers, CD-ROM data publishers, users of CD-ROMs, and major computer companies, to exploit the CD-ROM and <b>CD-Recordable</b> technology. This ECMA Standard can be used for both CD-ROM and CD-WO media for interchanging files. This ECMA Standard is seen as a revision and extension of ECMA- 119 for CD-ROM applications because it has eliminated several restrictions and performance problems of ECMA- 119. During the work in ECMA/TC 15, a lot of effort was spent in order to harmonize this ECMA Standard with ECMA- 167. This ECMA Standard follows the ECMA- 167 volume and file structure framework, and has common definitions with ECMA- 167 regarding file attributes and record structure...|$|E
