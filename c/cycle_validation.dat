40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 The {{design of}} a liquid {{nitrogen}} vaporization and pressure building device that has zero product waste while recovering some of its stored energy is of interest for the cost reduction of nitrogen for use in industrial processes. Current devices may waste up to 30 % of the gaseous nitrogen product by venting it to atmosphere.

A seven step cycle with changing volumes and ambient heat addition is proposed, eliminating all product waste and providing the means of energy recovery from the nitrogen.

40|$|Soil dust aerosol is an {{important}} factor of the climatic system. In order to evaluate the different aspects of the climatic effects of dust, estimates of its highly variable atmospheric distribution need to be computed by transport models. Such models also provide important means of evaluating the processes that govern changes in dustiness during different climatic periods. While models of the modern dust cycle are currently capable of simulating first-order patterns of its global distribution, the parameterization of dust emission in these models is still crude, since input information about soil properties and wind events cannot be resolved at a global scale. Regional models could be useful for evaluating emission parameterizations, as well as dust transport and depositional processes close to source regions. No single existing data set fully describes all aspects of the dust <b>cycle.</b> <b>Validation</b> of modeled dust distributions must therefore include comparisons with different types of observational data. While the compilation of such observational data sets is crucial for model development, model results can, in turn, provide guidance for new measurements of dust properties, which will be useful for future investigation of the dust cycle and its climatic effects.

There are three ways the femoral component can move relative to the tibial component; sliding, rolling and gliding and these are defined by the slide to roll ratio. Previous wear tester research has investigated the effects of multidirectional motion and slide to roll ratio, individually but not combined. The project aim was to design a machine that combined multidirectional motion with variable slide to roll ratio. A three station wear testing machine was designed and built featuring flexion extension, variable anterior posterior translation, variable internal external rotation and a 2 KN load per station. The TKR was simplified to a cylinder on flat. Lubrication was 25 % bovine serum and each station had its own recirculation system. A million <b>cycle</b> <b>validation</b> test was successfully carried out on non-irradiated UHMWPE samples using a slide to roll ratio of 1 : 0. 5 and the mean wear rate was 14. 7 mg/ 10 ^ 6 cycles. Polished areas and scratches from 3 rd body abrasion were observed. Magnification revealed a fine ripple pattern with a 1 - 2 micron periodicity. Ripples were randomly oriented, perpendicular to the primary direction of motion and a small number were running parallel to the primary direction of motion, indicative of rolling motion.

40|$|The {{sea level}} {{response}} to fluctuations in barometric pressure is currently modelled by the inverted barometer (IB) approximation which implies {{a change of}} approximately 1 cm in sea level for 1 mb change in atmospheric pressure (isostatic assumption). Therefore, sea level gradients perfectly compensate the horizontal gradients in atmospheric pressure fields {{and there is no}} pressure gradient at the sea surface. As a consequence, pressure-induced sea level slopes are not dynamically significant and are usually subtracted from altimetric records of sea surface height. The validity of the IB assumption and the character of the sea level response to barometric forcing is dependant on the time and space scales considered. In this work the magnitude of the Atlantic Ocean response to pressure variations will be quantified, in order to verify the validity of the isostatic assumption. To do that, we will calculate the correlation coefficients () between the sea level anomaly (SLA) and pressure variations (P), which should be approximately- 1 cm/mb if the oceanic response is isostatic. The altimeter data used cover a time period from May 1995 to June 1996 during which ERS- 1 and ERS- 2 satellites were put in the same ground track (the so-called Tandem Mission) with a time lag of approximately one day.

40|$|The {{abuse of}} {{anabolic}} androgenic steroids (AAS) {{has been considered}} a major public health problem during decades. Supraphysiological doses of AAS {{may lead to a}} variety of neuroendocrine problems. Precisely, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is one of the body systems that is mainly influenced by steroidal hormones. Fluctuations of the hormonal milieu result in alterations of reproductive function, which are made through changes in hypothalamic neurons expressing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). In fact, previous studies have shown that AAS modulate the activity of these neurons through steroid-sensitive afferents. To increase knowledge about the cellular mechanisms induced by AAS in GnRH neurons, we performed proteomic analyses of the murine hypothalamic GT 1 - 7 cell line after exposure to 17 α-methyltestosterone (17 α-meT; 1 μM). These cells represent a good model for studying regulatory processes because they exhibit the typical characteristics of GnRH neurons, and respond to compounds that modulate GnRH in vivo. Two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry analyses identified a total of 17 different proteins that were significantly affected by supraphysiological levels of AAS. Furthermore, pathway analyses showed that modulated proteins were mainly associated to glucose metabolism, drug detoxification, stress response and cell <b>cycle.</b> <b>Validation</b> of many of these proteins, such as GSTM 1, ERH, GAPDH, PEBP 1 and PDIA 6, were confirmed by western blotting. We further demonstrated that AAS exposure decreased expression of estrogen receptors and GnRH, while two important signaling pathway proteins p-ERK, and p-p 38, were modulated. Our results suggest that steroids have the capacity to directly affect the neuroendocrine system by modulating key cellular processes for the control of reproductive function...|$|E

In vitro experiments on human coronary and femoral arteries have demonstrated that different plaque types were detectable with intravascular ultrasound elastography. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the feasibility of applying intravascular elastography during interventional catheterization procedures. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were acquired in patients (n= 12) during PTCA procedures with an EndoSonics InVision echoapparatus equipped with radiofrequency output. The systemic pressure was used to strain the tissue, and the strain was determined using cross-correlation analysis of sequential frames. A likelihood function was determined to obtain the frames with minimal motion of the catheter in the lumen, since motion of the catheter prevents reliable strain estimation. Minimal motion was observed near end-diastole.

The final facet cluster is a table that ranks these facets from least to most problematic, documenting the student facets of thought across the content objective MUL. Over 500 student and teacher participants were used in the design and development of Fraction Diagnoser. All participants were affiliated with college developmental mathematics in Texas, representing four colleges and universities. Forty-eight student participants were individually interviewed to ascertain facets of understanding on the topic of MUL. Seven teacher participants were individually interviewed as to the effectiveness of Fraction Diagnoser in the classroom after the final step of the R&D cycle. Content experts were used to design the questions assessing skills and facets. Fraction Diagnoser was built using the Borg and Gall R&D cycle as its blueprint.
