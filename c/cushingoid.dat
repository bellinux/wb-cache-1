When dexamethasone is administered and a blood sample is tested, cortisol levels >50 nmol/l (1.81µg/dl) would be indicative of Cushing's syndrome because an ectopic source of cortisol or ACTH (such as adrenal adenoma) exists which is not inhibited by the dexamethasone.

40|$|Objective: Prolonged {{exogenous}} {{administration of}} ACTH or hydrocortisone or its analogs {{results in a}} clinical pattern identical to the spontaneous disorder and is frequently referred to as <b>Cushingoid</b> syndrome. This syndrome is generally reported {{as a result of}} oral or parenteral steroids administration. Case Report: Our report presents a five-month old baby with typical <b>Cushingoid</b> changes following local steroid application due to diaper rash. Clobetasol was used for diaper rash, but had not used systemic corticosteroid. Serum Cortical and ACTH was very low and no detectable. After discontinuation of local steroid, Skin complication recovered gradually and after 5 months, completely.

40|$|Osteonecrosis {{is related}} to the use of steroids in {{patients}} with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); its association with the use of ’pulses ’ of methylprednisolone (PMP) is not clear at present. In a retrospective analysis of 190 patients with SLE we found that 19 % of 36 patients treated with PMP had osteonecrosis compared with 6 % of 154 patients without that treatment (P < 0. 04). Risk factors associated with osteonecrosis were PMP treatment, <b>cushingoid</b> appearance, steroid doses &ge; 40 mg/day during the first month of treatment, a ratio of steroid dose in grams/year &ge; 12, hematuria and proteinuria.

40|$|The authors {{measured}} {{cerebral glucose}} metabolism (CMRglu) using [18 F]fluoro- 2 -deoxyglucose (FDG) {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) in patients with brain tumors to evaluate the effect of exogenous corticosteroids (in this instance, dexamethasone) on glucose metabolism. Fifty-six FDG-PET studies obtained in 45 patients with unilateral supratentorial brain tumors were analyzed. Patients with brain tumors were divided into three groups: 1) patients with <b>cushingoid</b> symptoms, who had been treated with combinations of radiotherapy and chemotherapy taking oral dexamethasone; 2) patients not taking dexamethasone but treated with radiotherapy; and 3) patients not taking dexamethasone {{who had not been}} treated with radiotherapy. Serial FDG-PET scans were obtained in eight of the <b>cushingoid</b> patients. Glucose metabolism was measured in the contralateral cerebral and ipsilateral cerebellar hemispheres in patients and compared to measurements taken from 19 normal volunteers. The authors found that in the <b>cushingoid</b> brain tumor patients there was a marked reduction in CMRglu compared to normal volunteers and other brain tumor patients (Kruskal-Wallis test; p 0. 001). In the majority of patients who had serial FDG-PET scans, there was a decline in glucose metabolism over time and in one patient, in whom dexamethasone was reduced in dosage, there was a subsequent increase in CMRglu.

40|$|Iatrogenic Cushing’s {{syndrome}} is an undesirable outcome of glucocorticoids treatment. It {{can be increased}} by pharmacologic interactions. Glucocorticoid therapy, given in association with ritonavir, and some azole treatments are causes of iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome. We present a patient with common-variable immunodeficiency who received 7 years of itraconazole ther-apy for bronchial colonization with Aspergillus in combination with inhaled fluticasone without any <b>Cushingoid</b> symptoms. Af-ter a switch to posaconazole, the patient developed <b>Cushingoid</b> symptoms.

It is well documented in asthmatic, human immunodefi-ciency virus (HIV) -infected patients receiving inhaled steroids in combination with a ritonavir-containing antiretroviral regimen (1, 2). Steroids, whether inhaled or injected by intranasal or epi-dural routes, have usually minimal systemic effects at recom-mended dosages. They are metabolized mainly by CYP 3 A 4.
