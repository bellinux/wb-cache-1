A common design for a swivel is a cylindrical rod that can turn freely within a support structure. The rod is usually prevented from slipping out by a nut, washer or thickening of the rod. The device can {{be attached to the}} ends of the rod or the center. Another common design is a sphere that is able to rotate within a support structure. The device is attached to the sphere. A third design is a hollow cylindrical rod that has a rod that is slightly smaller than its inside diameter inside of it. They are prevented from coming apart by flanges. The device may be attached to either end.|$|E

40|$|Four-month-old infants {{sometimes}} can perceive {{the unity of}} a partly hidden object. In each {{of a series of}} experiments, infants were habituated to one object whose top and bottom were visible but whose center was occluded by a nearer object. They were then tested with a fully visible continuous object and with two fully visible object pieces with a gap where the occluder had been. Patterns of dishabituation suggested that infants perceive the boundaries of a partly hidden object by analyzing the movements of its surfaces: infants perceived a <b>connected</b> <b>object</b> when its ends moved in a common translation behind the occluder. Infants do not appear to perceive a <b>connected</b> <b>object</b> by analyzing the colors and forms of surfaces: they did not perceive a <b>connected</b> <b>object</b> when its visible parts were stationary, its color was homogeneous, its edges were aligned, and its shape was simple and regular. These findings do not support the thesis, from gestalt psychology, that object perception first arises as a consequence of a tendency to perceive the simplest, most regular configuration, or the Piagetian thesis that object perception depends on the prior coordination of action.

40|$|An object–based analysis–synthesis coder for coding moving images at low {{data rates}} is investigated. The coder {{is based on}} the source model of {{articulated}} three–dimensional objects. This model describes the real objects by means of model objects defined by shape, motion and color parameters. The model objects may be articulated, i. e. they consist of several rigid object components linked to each other by joints. In this contribution a new algorithm for joint position estimation is presented. First the motion parameters of the <b>connected</b> <b>object</b> components are estimated at different times. For motion estimation a Maximum–Likelihood estimator is applied. Then the position of the joints is determined by evaluating the estimated motion parameters in the equations representing the constraints imposed by the joints on the relative motion of the <b>connected</b> <b>object</b> components. The algorithm was applied to a synthetic test sequence (CIF, 10 Hz). At a camera noise figure of 40 dB a joint position estimation average error of 0. 94 pel can be achieved...|$|E

We propose {{the use of}} WiFi management probes as a data transport mechanism for physical objects that are tagged with WiFi-enabled accelerometers and are capable of determining their state-of-use based on motion signatures. A local WiFi gateway captures these probes emit-ted from the <b>connected</b> <b>objects</b> and stores them locally after annotating them with a coarse grained location estimate using a proximity ranging algorithm. External applications can query the aggregated views of state-of-use and location traces of <b>connected</b> <b>objects</b> through a cloud-based query server.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study the Bousfield-Kan {{spectral}} sequence (BKSS) in the Quillen model category sCom of simplicial commutative FF₂ -algebras. We develop {{a theory of}} unstable operations for this BKSS and relate these operations with the known unstable operations on the homotopy of the target. We also prove a completeness theorem and a vanishing line theorem which, together, show that the BKSS for a <b>connected</b> <b>object</b> of sCom converges strongly to the homotopy of that object. We approach the computation of the BKSS by deriving a composite functor spectral sequence (CFSS) which converges to the BKSS E 2 -page. In fact, we generalize the construction of this CFSS to yield an infinite sequence of CFSSs, with each converging to the E 2 -page of the previous. We equip each of these CFSSs with a theory of unstable spectral sequence operations, after establishing the necessary chain-level structure on the resolutions defining the CFSSs. This technique may also yield operations on Blanc and Stover's generalized Grothendieck spectral sequences in other settings. We are able to compute the Bousfield-Kan E 2 -page in the most fundamental case, that of a connected sphere in sCom, using the structure defined on the CFSSs. We use this computation to describe the Ei-page of a May-Koszul spectral sequence which converges to the BKSS E 2 -page for any <b>connected</b> <b>object</b> of sCom. We conclude by making two conjectures which would, together, allow for a full computation of the BKSS for a connected sphere in sCom. by Michael Jack Donovan. Thesis: Ph.
