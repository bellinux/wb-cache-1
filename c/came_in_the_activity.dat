In {{a case study of}} a not-for-profit, membership-based Australian professional football club, 1647 respondents reported their perceptions of team support, sponsor integrity and purchase intentions for the sponsor&# 039;s products. Results revealed that the key pathway to purchase intention is associated with fan passion and a perception of sponsor integrity. This implies that the best mechanism for sponsor return on investment <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of <b>activities</b> to bolster both passion for the team and perceptions of sponsor integrity...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The article aims {{to review}} a {{university}} course, offered to students in both Australia and Germany, {{to encourage them to}} learn about designing, implementing, marketing and evaluating information programs and services in order to build active and engaged communities. The concepts and processes of Web 2. 0 technologies <b>come</b> together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> learning <b>activities,</b> with students establishing their own personal learning networks (PLNs). Design/methodology/approach – The case study examines the principles of learning and teaching that underpin the course and presents the students' own experiences of the challenges they faced as they explored the interactive, participative and collaborative dimensions of the web. Findings – The online format of the course and the philosophy of learning through play provided students with a safe and supportive environment for them to move outside of their comfort zones, to be creative, to experiment and to develop their professional personas. Reflection on learning was a key component that stressed the value of reflective practice in assisting library and information science (LIS) professionals to adapt confidently to the rapidly changing work environment. Originality/value – This study provides insights into the opportunities for LIS courses to work across geographical boundaries, to allow students to critically appraise library practice in different contexts and to become active participants in wider professional networks. ...|$|R

40|$|At {{first sight}} {{it is easy}} to {{understand}} that “ethics in business ” is a field which aims at explaining problems of moral aspect which <b>come</b> up currently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of economic agents from a market economy. Considering the cultural variety of moral values and principles lengthwise and crosswise the planet and, since the adopted policies led to many unacceptable effects, the idea of drawing up international ethic codes appeared more and more substantial through the explicit agreement of some governmental and non-governmental associations <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> big transnational corporations have the main role. <b>The</b> company system <b>in</b> Japan is so strict that it is quite hard, sometimes even impossible for a company to do business with another company with which it does not have personal, tight and previously established relations. The Japanese philosophy is that only <b>the</b> company <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> human relations are good will succeed <b>in</b> while <b>the</b> one with bad human relations will go bankrupt. In order to understand a Japanese company {{and to be able to}} cooperate with it, it is really useful for one to see it as an exclusive club, a cooperating union and a business enterprise because it incorporates features of these three aspects. To put it in a nutshell, it is all about the great ambition and diligence of the Japanese, which are well-know around the world and also the basis of ethics in business in Japan. Still, what it is not exactly known is why the Japanese are so keen upon success: it is a mixture of historical factors and self-image according to which they have been superior and ambitious from ancient times...|$|R
40|$|Jacksonville has a {{population}} of more than sixty thousand Negroes. As a general rule these Negroes are hardworking, and self-supporting to an extent even greater than in many cities where industries are many. It is inevitable, however, that out of {{a population}} of this size there would be hundreds of needy people; children whose parents have not sufficient means to properly care for them, children who have no parents, widows left destitute by death or desertion, aged people whose children cannot defray the expenses of feeding and caring for them, invalids and sick people whose maladies cannot be cured or alleviated through their own efforts. It is these people who were uppermost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minds of Eartha M. M. White, and her mother Clara before her, when they began the series of charitable activities that have finally come to a head <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Clara White Mission, {{probably one of the most}} diversified and far-reaching charitable organizations for Negroes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entire south. The Mission had its birth in an effort to establish an Old Folks Home. This was accomplished, and still stands today as the initial charitable effort of the head of the Mission. The care of orphaned children came later; still later, the distribution of food-sometimes humble, it is true, but frequently plentiful and always welcome-to <b>the</b> needy. This <b>activity</b> ranged from soup lunches at <b>the</b> home and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garage of Miss White to the elaborate dinners for the needy children, the blind and the aged at Christmas time at <b>the</b> Mission. Tuberculosis <b>came</b> <b>in</b> among <b>the</b> later <b>activities</b> of <b>the</b> Mission and its heads• From a beginning on absolutely nothing a persistent drive was made for a rest and cure home for the growing number of lung sufferers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city. Today there stands a comfortable, adequate home for tubercular prevention and cure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, which will probably be open and in full operation by the time this volume is off the press. Nearly a quarter of a century of careful planning and farsightedness have at last brought the Mission to the point that had been visualized for it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very beginning: a point where self-help, rather than bare charity, could be the keynote of many of its <b>activities.</b> Evidences of <b>the</b> success of this idea are to be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newel 2 ̆ 7 Mission activities; there are WPA classes where adult women are taught sewing, cooking and homemaking, under Mission care and guidance; a WPA sewing room <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mission building, where more than a hundred women are given steady employment; an employment service, that place dozens of men and women <b>in</b> jobs about <b>the</b> homes and stores of the city; an Art class, a Writers 2 ̆ 7 project, a class in nursing and home hygiene, and other similar projects to aid <b>the</b> dependent Negro <b>in</b> earning for himself some of those benefits that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past could <b>come</b> only through direct charity. Perhaps the most optimistic of the symptoms of this new day in Mission <b>activities,</b> however, is <b>the</b> commendable class of instruction for the blind. Even though gravely handicapped, these unfortunates are being taught to cane chairs, do beadwork, make belts, read Braille writing, and in many ways earn honest pennies for themselves in activities of a plane far above that of the street-corner mendicant. No volume this size can attempt to relate the past and present work of the Clara White Mission. It can only be hoped that <b>the</b> pictures <b>in</b> these pages can give a graphic summary <b>in</b> brief of <b>the</b> scope of the work, and more important, an idea of the work that still needs to be done. This work can only be accomplished through the interest and support of the public spirited citizens of Jacksonville. In an effort to solicit that interest and support this volume is dedicated.
