50|$|Intramuscular <b>cefodizime</b> {{bioavailability}} {{ranges from}} 90% to 100%. It distributes into many tissues and is approximately 81% bound to plasma proteins, chiefly albumin. The drug reaches minimum inhibitory concentrations approximately 2-3 hours after administration, maintaining it {{for several hours}} afterwards. Clearance of <b>cefodizime</b> from the body is predominantly renal, {{with the majority of}} the drug excreted unchanged within the first 12 hours. More specifically, <b>cefodizime</b> is mainly cleared via glomerular filtration in the kidney, in addition to some tubular secretion.

50|$|<b>Cefodizime</b> {{demonstrated}} superior clinical efficacy {{that what}} could be predicted from its in vitro experimental results. Certain immunomodulatory properties of the drug might account for its increased in vivo activity against specific bacterial species. These immunomodulatory properties stimulate some phagocyte and lymphocyte cellular functions when they have been impaired. It was shown in a 2004 study that <b>cefodizime</b> increased expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) in neutrophils stimulated by Klebsiella pneumoniae infection which then affected the production of cytokines in the stimulated cells.A 1992 study conducted in vitro susceptibility studies for <b>cefodizime</b> and found that gram negative bacteria with consistent susceptibility include: Enterobacteriaceae including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Neisseria meningitidis. In vitro susceptible gram positive bacteria include: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. <b>Cefodizime</b> was shown to be ineffective in vitro against Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia. Gram positive bacteria it was inactive against include Staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin-resistant Streptococcus aureus.

Thirty regi-mens comprising 21 antimicrobial drugs {{have been shown to}} be highly effective for rectal and urogenital infections; the agents involved are cefixime, <b>cefodizime,</b> cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefti-zoxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cefuroxime axetil, ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, norfloxacin, oflox-acin, pefloxacin, temafloxacin, azithromycin, aztreonam, netilmicin, rifampin plus erythromy-cin stearate, sisomicin, and spectinomycin. Few regimens {{have been shown to be}} highly effective against pharyngeal infections. Among those {{antimicrobial agents}} available for the treatment of uncomplicated gonococcal infections in the United States, ceftriaxone (125 mg), cefixime (400 mg), ciprofloxacin (500 mg), and ofloxacin (400 mg) appear to offer the best balance of proven efficacy and safety.

40|$|Contraluminal organic anion and cation {{transport}} in {{the proximal}} renal tubule: V. Interaction with sulfamoyl- and phenoxy diuretics, and with β-lactam antibiotics. In order {{to study the}} interaction of sulfamoyl- and phenoxy diuretics {{as well as of}} β-lactam antibiotics with the contraluminal anion and cation transport systems the inhibitory potency of these substances against the influx of 3 H-para-aminohippurate, 14 C-succinate, 35 S-sulfate and 3 H-Nl-methylnicotinamide into cortical tubular cells have been determined. 1.) 2 -, 3 - and 4 -sulfamoylbenzoate inhibit contraluminal PAH influx. N-dipropyl substitution to yield probenecid or ring-substitution to yield furosemide and piretanide augment the inhibitory potency. However, hydrochlorothiazide and acetazolamide exert only a moderate inhibitory potency. Succinate transport was inhibited by furosemide only. Sulfate transport was inhibited by furosemide and 3 -sulfamoyl- 4 -phenoxybenzoate as well as by probenecid, piretanide, hydrochlorothiazide and acetazolamide. 2.) Phenoxy acetate, -propionate, and -butyrate exert increasing inhibition against PAH transport. The weed-killers 2, 4 -dichloro-, and 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxyacetate (2, 4 D and 2, 4, 5 T) had a similar inhibitory potency, while ethacrynic acid showed a lower and the uricosuric tienilic acid a higher inhibitory potency. None of the compounds of this group interact with contraluminal succinate transport, and only the multiring-substituted compounds 2, 4 D, 2, 4, 5 T, ethacrynic and tienilic acid interact slightly with the sulfate transporter. 3.) The monocarboxy-lic penicillins benzylpenicillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin as well as the dicarboxylic ticarcillin interact with the contraluminal PAH transport. The aminopenicillin ampicillin had a lower, and apalcillin a higher inhibitory potency than monocarboxylic penicillin. Benzylpenicillin showed small inhibition against succinate transport and ticarcillin against sulfate transport. 4.) The monocarboxylic cephalosporine, 6315 S Shionogi, and the aminocephalosporines, cephalexin and cefadroxil, showed an app. Ki PAH aS the comparable penicillins. The zwitterions cephaloridine and cefpirome did not interact with the PAH transporter, but with the organic cation (NMN) transporter. Amongst the amino-thiazol-containing compounds cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and <b>cefodizime,</b> increasing interaction with the PAH transporter was seen dependent of a second ionizable anionic group. Compounds with two ionizable anionic groups (cefsulodin, ceftriaxone, <b>cefodizime)</b> exert also a small inhibitory potency against sulfate transport. None of the cephalosporins interacted with the dicarboxylate transporter. The interaction pattern of the tested compounds is in accordance with the specificity requirements for the contraluminal transporters depending on electrical charge and hydrophobicity...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{recombinant}} human {{granulocyte colony-stimulating factor}} (rhG-CSF) against severe infections in cyclophosphamide (CY) -induced neutropenic mice were investigated by its single use or by its combination with cephem antibiotics. Treatment with rhG-CSF {{increased the number of}} peripheral blood leucocytes and strikingly shortened the duration of the neutropenic state. Most of the regained population in the peripheral blood leucocytes were neutrophils. Functions of neutrophils, such as phagocytic activity, superoxide release, and expression of Mac- 1 molecules, were remarkably enhanced by administration of rhG-CSF. When rhG-CSF was administered to CY-induced neutropenic mice before infection, protective effects against various kinds of bacteria were remarkable. On the other hand, such remarkable effects were not observed when rhG-CSF was administered after infections. However, even in the case of post-infectious treatment, a combination therapy of rhG-CSF with cephem antibiotics, particularly with <b>Cefodizime</b> (CDZM), showed a significant improvement in the survival rate and a {{decrease in the number of}} viable bacteria in the liver. These results suggest that a combination therapy of rhG-CSF with cephem antibiotics, especially with CDZM, is an efficient regime against severe infections in patients with neutropenia induced by a heavy anti-tumour chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|Diarrhea {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality in humans in developed and developing countries. Furthermore, increased resistance to antibiotics has resulted in serious challenges in the treatment of this infectious disease worldwide. Therefore, there exists a need to develop alternative natural or combination drug therapies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the synergistic effect of curcumin- 1 in combination with three antibiotics against five diarrhea causing bacteria. The antibacterial activity of curcumin- 1 and antibiotics was assessed by the broth microdilution method, checkerboard dilution test, and time-kill assay. Antimicrobial activity of curcumin- 1 was observed against all tested strains. The MICs of curcumin- 1 against test bacteria ranged from 125 to 1000 [*]μg/mL. In the checkerboard test, curcumin- 1 markedly reduced the MICs of the antibiotics cefaclor, <b>cefodizime,</b> and cefotaxime. Significant synergistic effect was recorded by curcumin- 1 in combination with cefotaxime. The toxicity of curcumin- 1 with and without antibiotics was tested against foreskin (FS) normal fibroblast and no significant cytotoxicity was observed. From our result it is evident that curcumin- 1 enhances the antibiotic potentials against diarrhea causing bacteria in in vitro condition. This study suggested that curcumin- 1 in combination with antibiotics could lead to the development of new combination of antibiotics against diarrhea causing bacteria...|$|E
40|$|It has {{recently}} become apparent that overwhelming inflammatory reactions {{contribute to the}} high mortality rate associated with pneumococcal infection in immunocompetent hosts. <b>Cefodizime</b> (CEF) is an antibiotic {{that seems to be}} endowed with immunomodulating properties. To investigate the influence of CEF on the pulmonary inflammatory response induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae, we infected mice with repeated intranasal inoculations of 107 CFU of heat-killed fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bacteria, which are insensitive to the killing properties of the drug. CEF downregulated but did not abolish the strong polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) recruitment induced by S. pneumoniae. PMN recruitment was not primarily mediated by leukotriene B 4 in this model. The drug did not interfere with intrinsic mechanisms of phagocytosis by PMNs and alveolar macrophages. CEF totally abrogated the pneumococcus-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) secretion in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The drug also prevented IL- 6 release in lung homogenates and partly inhibited TNF-α, but it did not interfere with IL- 1 α secretion in the lungs of infected mice. The fractional and selective downregulation of inflammatory cells and cytokines by CEF suggests cell-specific and intracellular specific mechanisms of interaction of the drug. The immunomodulatory properties of CEF may help restrain excessive inflammatory reactions, thus contributing to the reported good clinical efficacy of the drug against lower respiratory tract infections...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies {{regarding}} the cross-reactivity and tolerability of alternative cephalosporins in large samples of subjects with an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to cephalosporins are lacking. OBJECTIVE: We sought {{to evaluate the}} possibility of using alternative cephalosporins in subjects with cephalosporin allergy who especially require them. METHODS: One hundred two subjects with immediate reactions to cephalosporins and positive skin test results to the responsible drugs underwent serum specific IgE assays with cefaclor and skin tests with different cephalosporins. Subjects were classified in 4 groups: group A, positive responses to 1 or more of ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefepime, <b>cefodizime,</b> and ceftazidime; group B, positive responses to aminocephalosporins; group C, positive responses to cephalosporins other than those belonging to the aforementioned groups; and group D, positive responses to cephalosporins belonging to 2 different groups. Group A subjects underwent challenges with cefaclor, cefazolin, and ceftibuten; group B participants underwent challenges with cefuroxime axetil, ceftriaxone, cefazolin, and ceftibuten; and group C and D subjects underwent challenges with some of the aforementioned cephalosporins {{selected on the basis of}} their patterns of positivity. RESULTS: There were 73 subjects in group A, 13 in group B, 7 in group C, and 9 in group D. Challenges with alternative cephalosporins (ceftibuten in 101, cefazolin in 96, cefaclor in 82, and cefuroxime axetil and ceftriaxone in 22 subjects) were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Cephalosporin hypersensitivity does not seem to be a class hypersensitivity. Subjects with cephalosporin allergy who especially require alternative cephalosporins might be treated with compounds that have side-chain determinants different from those of the responsible cephalosporins and have negative pretreatment skin test responses...|$|E
40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) is {{a recently}} developed technique {{that allows for}} {{the investigation of the}} surface morphology of a biological specimen at an unprecedented level of resolution. The aim {{of the present study was}} to explore some of the new opportunities offered by AFM by studying the morphological and surface alterations induced in Escherichia coli by supra-MICs and sub-MICs of a beta-lactam antibiotic (<b>cefodizime).</b> The underlying principle of AFM is the scanning and sensing of the topography of a sample by means of nearfield microscopy that makes it possible to obtain simultaneous digital measurements of the x, y, and z coordinates of any point on the bacterial surface with great resolution (x and y, � 20 Å; z, � 1 Å). Unlike scanning electron microscopy, performance of AFM does not require a vacuum, drying to the critical point, or the coating of the bacterial surface with a metal layer. The digital storage of the information makes it easy to rotate the image, observe the bacterial surface and induced structural alterations from different points of view, and obtain a cross-section at any desired point with precise, automatic measurement of the heights and sizes of normal versus damaged bacteria. Use of the new and outstanding technique of AFM will make it possible for researchers to investigate biological samples immersed in biological fluids and will also make it possible for them to study the morphological alterations of living bacteria exposed to antibiotics as they are taking place. �-Lactam antibiotics exert their antimicrobial activity by interferin...|$|E
40|$|Israa AJ Ibrahim, Rana M Al-Shwaikh, Mahmoud I IsmaeilDepartment of Biology, College of Education for Pure Science, Ibn Al-Haitham, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, IraqObjective: To {{investigate}} the virulence factors including hemolysin production, β-lactamase production, and biofilm formation. Antimicrobial resistance and plasmid content of 20 Escherichia coli isolates obtained from feces and Tigris water were screened. Methods: Ten clinical and ten environmental E. coli isolates {{were collected from}} children diarrhea and swim areas on Tigris River in Baghdad city, Iraq, respectively. The bacterial isolates were identified by cultural characteristics, Gram stain, biochemical tests, and screened {{for the presence of}} E. coli O 157 :H 7 serotype. Bacterial E. coli isolates were investigated for hemolysin production, biofilm formation, and β-lactamase production. Antibiotics susceptibility and plasmid content were determined. Results: A total of ten clinical and ten water E. coli isolates were studied. Results showed that all E. coli isolates give negative results for latex O 157 :H 7. Virulence factors analysis showed that 6 / 10 water isolates and 2 / 10 clinical isolates were hemolytic, 5 / 10 water isolates and 3 / 10 clinical isolates were biofilm formation, and 7 / 10 water isolates and 4 / 10 clinical isolates were β-lactamase producer. Antibiotics profile showed that all bacterial isolates were multidrug resistant. All E. coli isolates (100 %) were resistant to carbenicillin, <b>cefodizime,</b> imipenem, and piperacillin. The plasmid DNA analysis showed that all E. coli isolates contained plasmid with molecular weight range between 4. 507 kbp and 5. 07 kbp, but clinical isolates contained multiple small and mega plasmids. Conclusion: Our study revealed that E. coli isolates from river water exhibit a higher level of hemolysin production, β-lactamase production, and biofilm formation than feces isolates may be due to long adaptation. On the other hand, clinical E. coli isolates from feces showed higher level of antibiotic resistance and have multiple plasmids.
