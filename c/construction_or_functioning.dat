40|$|Abstract Background Yersinia pestis, the causative {{agent of}} plague, is a {{pathogen}} {{with a tremendous}} ability to cause harm and panic in populations. Due to the severity of plague and its potential {{for use as a}} bioweapon, better preventatives and therapeutics for plague are desirable. Subunit vaccines directed against the F 1 capsular antigen and the V antigen (also known as LcrV) of Y. pestis are under development. However, these new vaccine formulations have some possible limitations. The F 1 antigen is not required for full virulence of Y. pestis and LcrV has a demonstrated immunosuppressive effect. These limitations could damper the ability of F 1 /LcrV based vaccines to protect against F 1 -minus Y. pestis strains and could lead to a high rate of undesired side effects in vaccinated populations. For these reasons, the use of other antigens in a plague vaccine formulation may be advantageous. Results Desired features in vaccine candidates would be antigens that are conserved, essential for virulence and accessible to circulating antibody. Several of the proteins required for the <b>construction</b> <b>or</b> <b>function</b> of the type III secretion system (TTSS) complex could be ideal contenders to meet the desired features of a vaccine candidate. Accordingly, the TTSS needle complex protein, YscF, was selected to investigate its potential as a protective antigen. In this study we describe the overexpression, purification and use of YscF as a protective antigen. YscF immunization triggers a robust antibody response to YscF and that antibody response is able to afford significant protection to immunized mice following challenge with Y. pestis. Additionally, evidence is presented that suggests antibody to YscF is likely not protective by blocking the activity of the TTSS. Conclusion In this study we investigated YscF, a surface-expressed protein of the Yersinia pestis type III secretion complex, as a protective antigen against experimental plague infection. Immunization of mice with YscF resulted in a high anti-YscF titer and provided protection against i. v. challenge with Y. pestis. This is the first report to our knowledge utilizing a conserved protein from the type III secretion complex of a gram-negative pathogen as a candidate for vaccine development. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCilia and flagella perform diverse {{roles in}} {{motility}} and sensory perception, and defects in their <b>construction</b> <b>or</b> their <b>function</b> {{are responsible for}} human genetic diseases termed ciliopathies. Cilia and flagella construction relies on intraflagellar transport (IFT), the bi-directional movement of 'trains' composed of protein complexes found between axoneme microtubules and the flagellum membrane. Although extensive information about IFT components and their mode of action were discovered in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, other model organisms have revealed further insights about IFT. This {{is the case of}} Trypanosoma brucei, a flagellated protist responsible for sleeping sickness that {{is turning out to be}} an emerging model for studying IFT. In this article, we review different aspects of IFT, based on studies of Chlamydomonas and Trypanosoma. Data available from both models are examined to ask challenging questions about IFT such as the initiation of flagellum construction, the setting-up of IFT and the mode of formation of IFT trains, and their remodeling at the tip as well as their recycling at the base. Another outstanding question is the individual role played by the multiple IFT proteins. The use of different models, bringing their specific biological and experimental advantages, will be invaluable in order to obtain a global understanding of IFT...|$|R
40|$|Joint image filters {{leverage}} {{the guidance}} {{image as a}} prior and transfer the structural details from the guidance image to the target image for suppressing noise or enhancing spatial resolution. Existing methods either rely on various explicit filter <b>constructions</b> <b>or</b> hand-designed objective <b>functions,</b> thereby {{making it difficult to}} understand, improve, and accelerate these filters in a coherent framework. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach for constructing joint filters based on Convolutional Neural Networks. In contrast to existing methods that consider only the guidance image, the proposed algorithm can selectively transfer salient structures that are consistent with both guidance and target images. We show that the model trained on a certain type of data, e. g., RGB and depth images, generalizes well to other modalities, e. g., flash/non-Flash and RGB/NIR images. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed joint filter through extensive experimental evaluations with state-of-the-art methods...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary Cuban artist Carlos Garaicoa juxtaposes {{photographic}} {{images of}} Havana’s architectural ruins with timidly articulated drawings that trace {{the outlines of}} the dilapidated buildings in empty urbanscapes. Each of these fragile drawings, often composed of delicate threads adhered to a photograph of a site after demolition, serves as a vestige of the sagging structure that the artist photographed prior to destruction. The dialogue that emerges from these photograph/drawing diptychs implies the unmooring of the radical utopian underpinnings of revolutionary ideology that persisted in the policies of Cuba’s Período especial (Special Period) of the 1990 s, and suggests a more complicated narrative of Cuba’s modernity, in which the ambiguous drawings—which could indicate <b>construction</b> plans <b>or</b> <b>function</b> as mnemonic images—represent empty promises of economic growth that must negotiate the real socio-economic crises of the present. This article proposes that Garaicoa’s critique of the goals and outcomes of the Special Period through Havana’s ruins suggests a new articulation of the baroque expression— one that calls to mind the anti-authoritative strategies of twentieth-century Neo-Baroque literature and criticism. The artist historically grounds the legacy of the Cuban Revolution’s modernizing project in the country’s real economic decline in the post-Soviet era, but he also takes this approach to representing cities beyond Cuba’s borders, thereby posing broader questions about the architectural symbolism of the 21 st-century city in the ideological construction of modern globalizing society...|$|R
