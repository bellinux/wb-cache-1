40|$|Concept, {{design and}} results of {{hydrological}} experiments in two tilt-gutters (10 m and 1 m long) {{to test the}} performance of capillary barriers on landfill slopes are presented. Test variables were texture, vertical and lateral infiltration rate as well as inclination. Capillary barriers are formed by a capillary layer with a relatively high unsaturated water conductivity above a <b>capillary</b> <b>block</b> with a very low unsaturated conductivity. Capillary barriers perform very well {{as long as the}} total vertical and lateral infiltration rate does not exceed the lateral drainage capacity (LDC) of the system. Infiltration rates above LDC however generate vertical percolation into the <b>capillary</b> <b>block</b> while the lateral flow rate within the capillary layer remains more or less constant. Material properties exert a strong influence on the performance of capillary barriers. Well sorted sand and gravel are suitable for capillary layers and blocks respectively. Only very small amounts of silt and clay are tolerable. Both materials of a capillary barrier should meet the criteria for filter stability. The highest LDC (450 l/m/d on 1 m wide slope segment with an inclination of 1 : 5 or 11. 3) was measured with a combination of coarse sand as capillary layer and medium gravel as <b>capillary</b> <b>block.</b> Inclination influences the LDC of a capillary barrier, the following data were measured (medium sand above fine gravel) : 50, 75 and 115 l/m/d on a 1 m wide slope segment with inclinations of 1 : 25, 1 : 10 and 1 : 5 respectively. The experimental data were used to test the applicability of the finite element model SWMS_ 2 D to describe water transport in capillary barriers. The attempt to validate the model for this application was not successful, probably due to an inappropriate approach in estimating the unsaturated conductivity functions of the very well sorted and highly permeable materials. Capillary barriers can also be used in composite liners, e. g. beneath geomembranes, as a secondary liner as well as a control drainage layer for the upper, primary liner. (orig.)

40|$|The EU Landfill Directive (Council Directive 99 / 31 /EC) {{established}} that by June 1 st 2005 landfills may only accept waste of low biological activity. Such low calorific materials contribute significantly {{less to the}} production of landfill gas. Nevertheless, to minimize the emission of greenhouse gases, there is a need of further reducing landfill emissions, specifically methane emission. One of the cost-effective and attractive ways to reduce the methane emission is the use of landfill cover layers containing methane oxidation bacteria, reducing methane to CO 2 in the presence of O 2 (CH 4 + 2 O 2 ⇒ CO 2 + 2 H 2 O + 883 kJ/mol). In 2007 the project “MiMethox- Microbial Methane Oxidation“ sponsored by the BMBF (Federal Ministry for Education and Research) started. One of the work packages attend to a field study on a MBT-landfill (mechanically-biologically pre-treated waste) to monitor and characterize methane oxidation at low gas production landfills. Two test cells with a capillary barrier and different recultivation layers were constructed: a top soil, rich in humus, locally available and a mixture of loamy soil and compost (3 : 1 Vol-%). For the ongoing measurement campaign continuous logging of temperatures, soil humidity, soil parameters and seepage is done to characterize the methane reduction potential.

30|$|The CO 2 -induced <b>capillary</b> <b>blocking</b> in anode {{flow field}} {{is one of}} the key adverse factors to reduce the {{performance}} of a micro-direct methanol fuel cell (μDMFC). In order to solve this problem, new polycarbonate (PC) flow field plates with nested arrangement of hydrophilic fuel channels and superhydrophobic gas channels were designed, fabricated, and tested in this work. The gas channels were treated with solvent-induced crystallization using acetone solution. The superhydrophobicity with 160 ° water contact angle and 2 ° tilting angle was obtained on the PC substrates. A dummy cell using hydrogen peroxide decomposition reaction and a test loop were separately set up to evaluate the flow fields’ performance. It was found that a 37  % pressure drop decrease can be obtained in the new serpentine flow field compared with that of the conventional one. The benefit of the new flow field to remove gas bubbles was also confirmed by an in situ visualization study on the dummy cell. Results show that the auxiliary superhydrophobic gas channels can speed up the discharge of the gas bubbles from the flow field, which will in turn improve the μDMFC performance.|$|R

A comparison between the bent and the straight heat pipes was performed at different inclination angle. Experimental results {{show that there is}} a small temperature difference between the condenser of the straight and that of the bent at the vertical orientation. The temperature difference increases as an inclination angle increases. Furthermore, the response time increases as the inclination angle increases. The thermal response of the straight to a sudden heat load is slightly faster than that of the bent. However, as the inclination angle increases to after the horizontal, the heat flux at the condensers decreases nonlinearly and the response time increases nonlinearly. A two-phase flow map has been proposed to explain the nonlinear performance of the thermal response and the heat flux, based on force balance among gravity, capillary, friction and buoyancy force acting on the working fluids. The nonlinear performance of the thermal response and the heat flux results from the <b>capillary</b> <b>blocking</b> due to formation of liquid bridge of two-phase flow.

40|$|GPIHBP 1, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of {{capillary}} endothelial cells, shuttles {{lipoprotein lipase}} (LPL) from subendothelial spaces to the capillary lumen. An absence of GPIHBP 1 prevents {{the entry of}} LPL into <b>capillaries,</b> <b>blocking</b> LPL-mediated triglyceride hydrolysis and leading to markedly elevated triglyceride levels in the plasma (i. e., chylomicronemia). Earlier studies have established that chylomicronemia {{can be caused by}} LPL mutations that interfere with catalytic activity. We hypothesized that some cases of chylomicronemia might be caused by LPL mutations that interfere with LPL's ability to bind to GPIHBP 1. Any such mutation would provide insights into LPL sequences required for GPIHBP 1 binding. Here, we report that two LPL missense mutations initially identified in patients with chylomicronemia, C 418 Y and E 421 K, abolish LPL's ability to bind to GPIHBP 1 without interfering with LPL catalytic activity or binding to heparin. Both mutations abolish LPL transport across endothelial cells by GPIHBP 1. These findings suggest that sequences downstream from LPL's principal heparin-binding domain (amino acids 403 – 407) are important for GPIHBP 1 binding. In support of this idea, a chicken LPL (cLPL) –specific monoclonal antibody, xCAL 1 – 11 (epitope, cLPL amino acids 416 – 435), blocks cLPL binding to GPIHBP 1 but not to heparin. Also, changing cLPL residues 421 to 425, 426 to 430, and 431 to 435 to alanine blocks cLPL binding to GPIHBP 1 without inhibiting catalytic activity.

METHODS: The microcirculation in the rectal mucosa of adult patients with severe malaria was assessed by use of OPS imaging, at admission and then daily. Comparison groups comprised patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, patients with bacterial sepsis, and healthy individuals. RESULTS: Erythrocyte velocities were measured directly in 43 adult patients with severe falciparum malaria, of whom 20 died. Microcirculatory blood flow was markedly disturbed, with heterogeneous obstruction that was proportional to severity of disease. <b>Blocked</b> <b>capillaries</b> were found in 29 patients (67 %) and were associated with concurrent hyperdynamic blood flow (erythrocyte velocity, > 750 mm/s) in adjacent vessels in 27 patients (93 %).

A blockage of the capillary pores (pore discontinuity) as well as a blockage of the ITZs contribute to an increased depercolation of the cementitious microstructure and improve the microstructural performance. The surface durability of freeze/thaw resistance of pavements and chloride ingress is evaluated in view of the pore continuity modelling approach.
