This chapter draws on a continuing research project which contributes to the operationalization of the capabilities approach by devising over sixty <b>capability</b> <b>indicators</b> which can be used to extend coverage of indices such as HDI, illustrating different ways in which such indicators may be analysed, and discussing some of the associated methodological issues that have emerged in the process. Based on usable observations from a national UK sample of 1, 000 adults, this chapter uses latent class analysis to identify an impoverished group of respondents with low capabilities across the board, builds models of experienced violence and subjective wellbeing as a function of experienced and anticipated violence, and explores the relationship between <b>capability</b> <b>indicators</b> and subjective wellbeing. Substantive findings include: the identification of a group with low all round capabilities associated with low health and low income; evidence that fear of future violence can be a more significant determinant of subjective wellbeing than past experience of violence; and evidence which supports the view that a large diverse set of non-financial dimensions of capability have a detectable impact on subjective wellbeing.

The discretization of remotely sensed data is an important data preprocessing approach in classical RS-based remote-sensing classification. Appropriate discretization methods can improve the adaptability of the classification rules and increase {{the accuracy of the}} remote-sensing classification. To assess the performance of discretization methods this article adopts three indicators, which are the compression <b>capability</b> <b>indicator</b> (CCI), consistency indicator (CI), and number of the cut points (NCP). An appropriate discretization method for the RS-based classification of a given remotely sensed image can be found by comparing the values of the three indicators and the classification accuracies of the discretized remotely sensed images obtained with the different discretization methods. To investigate the effectiveness of our method, this article applies three discretization methods of the Entropy/MDL, Naive, and SemiNaive to a TM image and three indicators for these discretization methods are then calculated.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades there has been {{increasing}} interest in the role of forests and wetlands as flood mitigating tools due to growing concerns regarding the sustainability of many traditional engineering flood defences such as dykes, sea walls and dams. In forests, the role is facilitated by the interaction between trees, soil and water. Specifically trees reduce surface runoff and prevent flooding through increased evapotranspiration and canopy interception and enhance physical and hydraulic properties of soil that are critical for the absorption and retention of flood waters by the soil. It is increasingly realised that the answer to flood mitigation is not a blanket recommendation to “plant trees”. This is because the role of trees varies spatially and temporally as a function of climate, topography, rainfall properties, soil type and condition, catchment scale and geology, among others. For example, where trees are present in wetlands, particularly forested wetlands, the mechanisms by which trees interact with soil and water are similar to that in forests but because of a high water table, the impact of trees may be reduced. Therefore, the mere presence of forests and forested wetlands will not necessarily deliver flood risk management. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the effectiveness of trees as flood mitigating tools under various bio-geo climatic factors in forests and forested wetland environments. Three forms of investigation were followed to fulfil this purpose. A detailed literature review was carried out to assess the role of trees and forests as flood mitigation tools under changing climate, topography, species type, rainfall properties, soil type and condition, catchment scale and geology. A field experiment was carried out to collect data and analyse the effect of trees on soil physical and hydraulic properties that include bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil organic carbon, soil moisture content, matric potential and soil moisture retention in a previously forested wetland undergoing restoration in New Zealand. A spatially explicit decision support tool, the Land Use <b>Capability</b> <b>Indicator</b> (LUCI) was then used to determine appropriate areas where intervention can be targeted to optimise the role of trees as flood mitigating tools in previously forested wetlands undergoing restoration. The detailed review identified a major data gap in the role of trees under hydric conditions (high water table), along with uncertainties on their effectiveness in large catchments (>˜ 40 km²) and in extreme rainfall events. The field experiment provided the first set of soil hydrology data from an ephemeral wetland in New Zealand showing the benefits of newly established trees in improving hydraulic conductivity of soils. The soil hydrology data is a useful baseline for continuous monitoring of the forested wetlands undergoing restoration. The use of the Land Use <b>Capability</b> <b>Indicator</b> was its first application for the optimisation of flood mitigation in a forested wetland. Its suggested target areas are not necessarily conducive for survival of some tree species, although if suitable species are established, flood risk mitigation could be maximised. Further research on what native species are best for what conditions and in what combinations is recommended, to increase survival in the proposed target areas...|$|E

As the variety and complexity of these tools increases, {{there is a need}} for comparative studies across a range of settings, allowing users to make an informed choice. Using examples of provisioning and regulating services (water supply, carbon storage and nutrient retention), we compare three spatially explicit tools – LUCI (Land Utilisation and <b>Capability</b> <b>Indicator),</b> ARIES (Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services) and InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs). Models were parameterised for the UK and applied to a temperate catchment with widely varying land use in North Wales. Although each tool provides quantitative mapped output, can be applied in different contexts, and can work at local or national scale, they differ in the approaches taken and underlying assumptions made. In this study, we focus on the wide range of outputs produced for each service and discuss the differences between each modelling tool. Model outputs were validated using empirical data for river flow, carbon and nutrient levels within the catchment. The sensitivity of the models to land-use change was tested using four scenarios of varying severity, evaluating the conversion of grassland habitat to woodland (0 – 30 % of the landscape). We show that, while the modelling tools provide broadly comparable quantitative outputs, each has its own unique features and strengths. Therefore the choice of tool depends on the study question...|$|E
40|$|Increasing global {{populations are}} placing {{increasing}} pressure on our natural systems, reducing {{their capacity to}} produce the ecosystem services that we rely upon for human wellbeing (World Bank, 2004). Clarifying the implications of land-use decisions across the range of ecosystem services is fundamental to understanding the trade-offs inherent in land-use options. LUCI (the Land Utilization and <b>Capability</b> <b>Indicator)</b> is an emergent Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based framework developed to enable the mapping of several ecosystem services in a spatially explicit manner. This process enables {{a clearer understanding of}} the inter-dependencies between ecosystems and potential implications and trade-offs of management interventions across a range of services. There is however, limited understanding of the impact, utility and credibility of such tools for land-use decision-makers, or of how they perceive the information conveyed. This Thesis considered the impact that presenting information on land-use trade-offs through LUCI had on land-owners at the farm scale. This research supports previous findings that information alone does not drive behaviour (or decision-making) (Kollmuss, 2002, Fisk, 2011; Kennedy, 2010; Mackenzie-Mohr, 2000; Stern, 2000). Similarly, perceived credibility was not the main driver of decision-making nor is it necessarily rationally based. However without it, voluntary adoption of a new technology or tool is unlikely. Therefore, in seeking to diffuse tools, such as LUCI within a community, process design should take into account the social structures and the characteristics of targeted individuals within that community. The influence of temporal and context specific factors on decision-making provides both barriers and opportunities for technology diffusion. The research findings propose that when integrating new tools and technologies within communities, consideration is given to using a suite of tools, mechanisms and theories in concert such as Community-Based Social Marketing (Mackenzie-Mohr, 2011) and Diffusion Theory (Rogers, 2003) to facilitate improved diffusion and uptake by communities...|$|E

40|$|Due to its {{location}} within the typhoon belt, the Philippines {{is vulnerable to}} tropical cyclones that can cause destructive floods. Climate change is likely to exacerbate these risks through increases in tropical cyclone frequency and intensity. To protect populations and infrastructure, disaster risk management in the Philippines focuses on real-time flood forecasting and structural measures such as dikes and retaining walls. Real-time flood forecasting in the Philippines mostly utilises two models from the Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC) : the Hydrologic Modeling System (HMS) for watershed modelling, and the River Analysis System (RAS) for inundation modelling. This research focuses on using non-structural measures for flood mitigation, such as changing land use management or watershed rehabilitation. This is being done by parameterising and applying the Land Utilisation and <b>Capability</b> <b>Indicator</b> (LUCI) model to the Cagayan de Oro watershed (1400  km 2) in southern Philippines. The LUCI model is capable of identifying areas providing ecosystem services such as flood mitigation and agricultural productivity, and analysing trade-offs between services. It can also assess whether management interventions could enhance or degrade ecosystem services at fine spatial scales. The LUCI model was used to identify areas within the watershed that are providing flood mitigating services and areas that would benefit from management interventions. For the preliminary comparison, LUCI and HEC-HMS were run under the same scenario: baseline land use and the extreme rainfall event of Typhoon Bopha. The hydrographs from both models were then input to HEC-RAS to produce inundation maps. The novelty {{of this research is}} two-fold: (1)  this type of ecosystem service modelling has not been carried out in the Cagayan de Oro watershed; and (2)  this is the first application of the LUCI model in the Philippines. Since this research is still ongoing, the results presented in this paper are preliminary. As the land use and soil parameterisation for this watershed are refined and more scenarios are run through the model, more robust comparisons can be made between the hydrographs produced by LUCI and HEC-HMS and how those differences affect the inundation map produced by HEC-RAS...|$|E
40|$|Poor {{water quality}} is {{currently}} a major environmental issue worldwide and in New Zealand, where reactive Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorous (P) lost from agricultural fields are significant drivers of water quality degradation in rural catchments. Irrigation application to crops is essential to agricultural production however irrigation inputs can increase N and P losses to waterways via drainage and/or overland flow directly {{and as a result}} of reduced soil capacity to buffer rainfall events. Indirect nutrient losses are also increased following irrigation implementation due to amplified farming intensity. Furthermore, irrigation applications represent the world’s greatest consumptive use of water. Improving irrigation efficiency with regard to water use represents a synergistic opportunity for the improvement of a number of different ecosystem services including water quality, water supply, and food production. Spatially explicit modelling of irrigation is needed to determine inefficiencies in water delivery and target these inefficiencies for management or mitigation at sub-field scales. A complimentary need exists for irrigation modelling within ecosystem service decision support tools so that nutrient and water movement can be accurately quantified in irrigated environments. This thesis describes the development and implementation of SLIM – the Spatially-explicit LUCI Irrigation Model. SLIM adapts existing lumped hydrological and irrigation modelling techniques and practices to a fully distributed, spatially explicit framework, so that sub-field variations in water flows resulting from variable soil properties are accounted for. SLIM is generally applicable across New Zealand, using readily available national scale datasets and literature derived parameters. SLIM is capable of predicting irrigation depth and timing based on common management strategies and irrigation system characteristics, or can replicate irrigation applications where information is available. Outputs from SLIM are designed to assist irrigation management decisions at the field level, and to inform the hydrology component of the Land Utilisation and <b>Capability</b> <b>Indicator</b> (LUCI) ecosystem service assessment framework. Standalone SLIM outputs include time-series files, water balance plots, and raster maps describing the efficiency and efficacy of the modelled irrigation system. SLIM has been applied in three different agroecosystems in New Zealand under surface, micro, and spray irrigation systems, each characterised by different levels of data availability. Results show that SLIM is able to accurately predict the timing of irrigation applications and provide usable information to inform irrigation application decisions. SLIM outputs emphasise the importance of soil variability with regard to water loss and risk of nutrient leaching. Opportunity exists for irrigation water use efficiency to be improved through targeted management at sub-field scales in New Zealand farming systems...|$|E

Therefore, the early prediction of product quality, as affected by manufacturing system configuration decisions, {{can enhance the}} manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s competitiveness through achieving higher quality levels at lower costs in a responsive manner. In this research, a conceptual framework is proposed for the proactive assessment of product quality {{in terms of the}} manufacturing system configuration parameters. A new comprehensive model {{that can be used in}} comparing different system configurations based on quality is developed using Analytic Hierarchy Process. In addition, a hierarchical fuzzy inference system is developed to model the ill-defined relation between manufacturing system design parameters and the resulting product quality. This model is capable of mapping the considered manufacturing system configuration parameters into a Configuration <b>Capability</b> <b>Indicator</b> (CCI), expressed in terms of sigma capability level, which can be compared to the benchmark Six Sigma capability. The developed models have been applied to several case studies (Test Parts ANC- 90 and ANC- 101, Cylinder Head Part Family, Gearbox Housing, Rack Bar Machining, and Siemens Jeep Intake Manifold) with different configuration scenarios for illustration and verification. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the CCI in comparing different system configurations from quality point of view and in supporting the decision-making during the early stages of manufacturing system development. The included application of the developed models emphasized that high quality levels can be achieved by investigating all the improvement opportunities and it is recommended that efforts should be directed in the first place to design the system with high defect prevention capability. This can be achieved by using highly capable processes, implementation of mistake proofing techniques, as well as minimizing variability due to parallel processing and variation stack up. Considering the relationship between quality and complexity, it has been concluded that the CCI represents the time-independent real complexity of a system configuration. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the product complexity adversely affects the resulting product quality. Therefore, it is recommended that high product quality levels can be achieved not only by using highly capable system configurations, but also by minimizing the product complexity during the design stage.

This paper presents a matrix-based model, defined in terms of service components, user perceptions, agent <b>capabilities,</b> performance <b>indicators</b> and evaluation functions, which allows to estimate the overall quality of a set of convergent services, as perceived by the users, from a set of performance and/or Quality of Service (QoS) parameters of the convergent IP transport networ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to address}} a central {{question}} in strategy: how do internal resources firms mediate {{the effect of the}} external resources on the firms' performance? Design/methodology/approach – The research was conducted in a sample of 173 Spanish innovative firms located in the Valencia region. Following the literature, the growth of the firm has been used as the main performance indicator. The paper considers the application in this context of the particular and new analysis techniques to combine mediator and moderator effects. Findings – The research shows firms with higher internal resources exploit better external resources. The results confirm that knowledge intensive business services providers, as a form of external resources, exercise a positive influence on innovative firms' performance through the mediating effect of firms' internal assets. Research limitations/implications – First, the study uses only two well-known internal resources and <b>capabilities</b> <b>indicators.</b> Second, the paper applies a strict and simple measure to the growth of innovative firms. Third, another limitation of this research relates to the sample and population of companies. Practical implications – The study shows that the partial mediating effect exercised by internal resources and capabilities on growth, becomes more intense when new firms benefit from cluster location. Originality/value – This study represents a new step toward closing the analytical gap in the existing literature on the potential interactions between external resources and new firm's internal attributes, and their combined effects on performance...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{sets out}} to analyse the mismatch between the national primary education curriculum and the classroom reality in rural government primary schools in Uganda. I. e., {{the impact of the}} introduction of the Thematic Curriculum in Uganda in 2007 as a quality improvement intervention is examined. For this purpose, a Capability Approach School Development Index is explored in a rural area in the north of Uganda to gain insight in the teachers´ and students´ capabilities that affect the quality of education. These capabilities are important because the traditional understanding of the quality of education does not include the context and process of education. This holds that the possible additional factors that hinder the quality of education in rural areas are not considered. The data has been collected in a three-month period in Uganda, including a 10 -day fieldwork in the selected area in Northern Uganda, and consists of 35 semi-structured in-depth expert interviews, five group discussions and eight observation reports. The results show that the constructs of implementation are insufficiently fulfilled to achieve the intended quality improvement. Additionally, the <b>capability</b> <b>indicators</b> show that teachers’ and students’ performance is hindered {{to such an extent that}} the curriculum implementation and education quality are not on the agenda in Namasale Sub-County: e. g., even basic survival capabilities – clean water and food - are not sufficiently fulfilled for teachers and students. This hinders the well-being and agency freedoms of the teachers and students and, thus, the quality of education...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study re-examines the {{catching-up}} hypothesis at {{the industry}} level across the main OECD countries, using panel data econometric models involving technological gap indicators calculated with a nonparametric distance function suggested by Färe et al. [Färe, R. S., Grosskopf, M. N., Norris, M., Xhang, Z., 1994. Productivity growth, technical progress, and efficiency change in industrialized countries. American Economic Review 84, 66 – 83]. The {{results show that}} there is statistical evidence of a catching-up process at the industry level. Moreover, both tradables and nontradables sectors exhibit catching-up effects and technology adoption from abroad. This result complements the findings by Bernard and Jones [Bernard, A. B., Jones, C. I., 1996 a. Comparing apples to oranges: productivity convergence and measurement across industries and countries. American Economic Review 86 (5), 1216 – 1238., Bernard, A. B., Jones, C. I., 1996 b.

Bergström, eds, Government and Growth, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 61 – 126] that there is no (or even a slow) catching-up effect in the manufacturing sector. Moreover, social <b>capability</b> <b>indicators</b> evaluated for each country show that “Non-European” and “Central European” tradables sectors have a rather similar degree of inefficiency while “North European” countries are less efficient for both tradables and non-tradables. Lastly, both the cross country and the cross sectors dispersions of inefficiency levels are smaller for tradables sectors than for non-tradables...|$|R
40|$|In Burkina Faso, the {{analysis}} of the consequences of the urbanization in terms of poverty, based on a spatio-time-series approach, organized in function, on the one hand, information of the household surveys – 1994 - 95 and 1998 –, and the demographic and health surveys – 1992 - 93 and 1998 - 99 – and, on the other hand, the administrative division according to 30 provinces, allows to formulate three conclusions. Firstly, the study shows that the growth rate of the incidence of relative regional urban poverty is higher 14 percent than that of the rate of urbanization. Although the values of elasticities decrease with the rise in the coefficient of aversion for poverty, they remain higher than the unit. In this respect, the increasing difficulty of the labour market access, the increased precariousness of urban employment and the progressive weakening of the mobilization of the social capital, could explain the absolute and relative increase of monetary deprivations in the cities. Secondly, by using the child mortality as example of households <b>capabilities</b> <b>indicator,</b> research highlights, correlatively with the urbanization, {{at the same time a}} progression of the level of the child survival, and a rise in the inequality of the infant and child mortality. This evolution, coherent with the increase in the inegality of the monetary expenditure in urban environment, illustrates, indirectly, the incapacity of the authorities to counterbalance the insufficient mobilization of the assets by the market or the social institutions, by the development of the access to the social infrastructures and the introduction of safety social nets. Thirdly, although Burkina Faso remains a largely rural country – in 2030, a third of the population is likely to be urbanized –, the preceding tendencies, if they were confirmed –. including in other developing countries –, could mean that, in the long run, sectoral reallocation of poverty, inherent in the structural changes and with the shifts in population which accompany it, constitutes new challenges of the strategies of development.
