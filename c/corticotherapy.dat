40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the consequences of}} the chronic use of systemic corticosteroids in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis by means of evaluating osteochondral effects depicted by magnetic resonance imaging. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed clinical and magnetic resonance imaging findings in 69 children (72 knees) with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Two groups were studied. Group I: 34 (49. 3 %) children had previous or current use of systemic <b>corticotherapy</b> (22 girls; 12 boys; mean age: 11. 3 years; mean disease duration: 5. 9 years; mean <b>corticotherapy</b> duration: 2. 9 years; mean cumulative dose of previous corticosteroids: 5000 mg); Group II: 35 (50. 7 %) children had no previous use of corticosteroids (27 girls; 8 boys; mean age: 11. 7 years; mean disease duration: 5. 3 years). The groups were compared statistically. RESULTS: In the group that had received <b>corticotherapy</b> (Group I), osteochondral abnormalities were significantly correlated to long-standing disease (> 3. 5 years; p< 0. 001). This correlation was not found in the group that had no previous history of <b>corticotherapy</b> (Group II). No correlations were established between median dose of corticosteroids and magnetic resonance imaging findings. CONCLUSION: It is important to further investigate the long-term intra-articular effects of systemic <b>corticotherapy</b> to ensure that the side effects of the aggressive therapy will not be more harmful for the joints than the symptoms suffered over the natural course of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Community-acquired {{pneumonia}} (CAP) induces {{lung and}} systemic inflammation, leading to high morbidity and mortality. We systematically reviewed {{the risks and}} benefits of adjunctive <b>corticotherapy</b> in the management of patients with CAP. We systematically searched Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials comparing adjunctive <b>corticotherapy</b> and antimicrobial therapy with antimicrobial therapy alone in patients with CAP. The primary outcome was 30 -day mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay, time to clinical stability and severe complications. 14 trials (2077 patients) were included. The reported 30 -day mortality was 7. 9 % (80 / 1018) among patients treated with adjunctive <b>corticotherapy</b> versus 8. 3 % (85 / 1028) among patients treated with antimicrobial therapy alone (RR 0. 84; 95 %CI 0. 55 to 1. 29). Adjunctive <b>corticotherapy</b> was associated with a reduction of severe complications (RR 0. 36; 95 %CI 0. 23 to 0. 56), a shorter length of stay (9. 0 days; 95 %CI 7. 6 to 10. 7 vs 10. 6 days; 95 %CI 7. 4 to 15. 3) and a shorter time to clinical stability (3. 3 days; 95 % CI 2. 8 to 4. 1 vs 4. 3 days; 95 %CI 3. 6 to 5. 1). The risk of hyperglycemia was higher among patients treated with adjunctive <b>corticotherapy</b> (RR 1. 59; 95 %CI 1. 06 to 2. 38), whereas the risk of gastro-intestinal bleeding was similar (RR 0. 83; 95 %CI 0. 35 to 1. 93). In the subgroup analysis based on CAP severity, a survival benefit was found among patients with severe CAP (RR 0. 47; 95 %CI 0. 23 to 0. 96). Adjunctive <b>corticotherapy</b> is associated with a reduction of length of stay, time to clinical stability, and severe complications among patients with CAP, but the effect on mortality remains uncertain...|$|E
40|$|It is {{acknowledged}} that high-dose <b>corticotherapy,</b> radiotherapy, or surgical decompression of the orbit are often efficient in dysthyroid optic neuropathy. <b>Corticotherapy</b> and radiotherapy are also given {{to patients with}} dysfunction of eye-muscle motility and/or proptosis {{in the absence of}} visual loss. The latter indication has been retrospectively evaluated in 13 patients. The limited character of our series is partially explainable by strict inclusion criteria (objective evaluation of muscle dysfunction and proptosis). We failed to demonstrate any significant functional improvement after oral <b>corticotherapy</b> and/or radiotherapy. It thus appears that our study sheds doubt on the actual efficacy of these treatments in patients presenting with not very evolutive involvement of eye-muscle motility. A larger study aimed at comparing the benefits and drawbacks of these treatments is consequently to be encouraged.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} effects of <b>corticotherapy,</b> in the presence and absence of uterine inflammation, on proteomics of endometrial fluid from mares susceptible to endometritis. In 11 mares, estrus was induced seven times with 5 mg PGF 2 α given at 14 -day intervals. The first estrus was a control (no treatment). During the third estrus, mares received glucocorticoid (GC) treatment (20 mg isoflupredone acetate) every 12 h, for three consecutive days. The fifth estrus was the Infected treatment (intrauterine infusion of 1 × 109 colony-forming unit/mL Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus). Finally, the seventh was a combination of GC + Infected treatment (infusion of bacteria 24 h after the first GC treatment). At 12 h after the end of each treatment, uterine samples were collected and submitted to two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 D-PAGE) for protein separation and mass spectrometry. Both GC treatment and uterine lumen infection induced proteomic alterations in the endometrial fluid of susceptible mares, characterized by an increase, decrease, or both in the relative optic density and/or frequency of inflammatory acute phase proteins (APP), with major alterations occurring when <b>corticotherapy</b> was applied in the presence of an infectious process. <b>Corticotherapy</b> in the presence of infection increased α 1 -antitrypsin (AAT), transthyretin (TT), and actin, but reduced immunoglobulin G, whereas intrauterine infection increased haptoglobin (Hp) and apolipoprotein A- 1 (ApoA- 1) and decreased transferrin (TF). Infection reduced levels of α 1 -antitrypsin and transthyretin, whereas <b>corticotherapy</b> in the presence of infection increased their frequency. We concluded that GC influenced the immune response, not only as suppressors, but also as enhancers of local defense mechanisms, through an immunomodulatory action.

Hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) add to the morbidity and mortality of traumatic brain-injured patients. In one study, hydrocortisone for treatment of traumatic-induced corticosteroid insufficiency (CI) in multiple injured patients has prevented HAP, particularly in the sub-group of patients with severe TBI.

Whether an association of hydrocortisone with fludrocortisone protects from HAP and improves neurological recovery is uncertain. The aim {{of the current study}} is to compare <b>corticotherapy</b> to placebo for TBI patients with CI. Methods: The CORTI-TC (<b>Corticotherapy</b> in traumatic brain-injured patients) trial is a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, two-arms study. Three hundred and seventy six patients hospitalized in Intensive Care Unit with a severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8) are randomized in the first 24 hours following trauma to hydrocortisone (200 mg. day- 1 for 7 days, 100 mg on days 8 - 9 and 50 mg on day- 10) with fludrocortisone (50 μg for 10 days) or double placebo.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundIrreversible pulpitis is {{a highly}} painful {{inflammatory}} condition of the dental pulp which represents a common dental emergency. Recommended care is partial endodontic treatment. The dental literature reports major difficulties in achieving adequate analgesia to perform this emergency treatment, {{especially in the case}} of mandibular molars. In current practice, short-course, orally administered <b>corticotherapy</b> is used for the management of oral pain of inflammatory origin. The efficacy of intraosseous local steroid injections for irreversible pulpitis in mandibular molars has already been demonstrated but resulted in local comorbidities. Oral administration of short-course prednisolone is simple and safe but its efficacy to manage pain caused by irreversible pulpitis has not yet been demonstrated. This trial aims to evaluate the noninferiority of short-course, orally administered <b>corticotherapy</b> versus partial endodontic treatment for the emergency care of irreversible pulpitis in mandibular molars. Methods/designThis study is a noninferiority, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial conducted at the Bordeaux University Hospital. One hundred and twenty subjects will be randomized in two 1 : 1 parallel arms: the intervention arm will receive one oral dose of prednisolone (1  mg/kg) during the emergency visit, followed by one morning dose each day for 3  days and the reference arm will receive partial endodontic treatment. Both groups will receive planned complete endodontic treatment 72  h after enrollment. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with pain intensity below 5 on a Numeric Scale 24  h after the emergency visit. Secondary outcomes include comfort during care, the number of injected anesthetic cartridges when performing complete endodontic treatment, the number of antalgic drugs and the number of patients coming back for consultation after 72  h. DiscussionThis randomized trial will assess the ability of short-term <b>corticotherapy</b> to reduce pain in irreversible pulpitis as a simple and rapid alternative to partial endodontic treatment and to enable planning of endodontic treatment in optimal analgesic conditions.
