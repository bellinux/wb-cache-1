More screenshots came around May 2000. These screenshots showed the new interface of the game, which looked like the human interface in the eventual final release, however had small cannons above the minimap and the <b>command</b> <b>button</b> space. The gold display was still eye-shaped, but the last screenshot before E3 2000 shows a rectangle-shaped gold display. Most models, icons, textures and abilities that you can find on these screenshots never appeared in the retail version. Then from E3 2000 around May 12, 2000 to ECTS 2000 the game didn't change very much.

50|$|The {{first step}} in {{developing}} an event-driven program is to write a series of subroutines, or methods, called event-handler routines.

Many modern-day programming environments provide the programmer with event templates, allowing the programmer to focus on writing the event code.|$|E

50|$|A {{common and}} {{easy way to}} {{generate}} VBA code is by using the Macro Recorder.The Macro Recorder records actions of the user and generates VBA code {{in the form of}} a macro. These actions can then be repeated automatically by running the macro. The macros can also be linked to different trigger types like keyboard shortcuts, a <b>command</b> <b>button</b> or a graphic. The actions in the macro can be executed from these trigger types or from the generic toolbar options. The VBA code of the macro can also be edited in the VBE. Certain features such as loop functions and screen prompts by their own properties, and some graphical display items, cannot be recorded, but must be entered into the VBA module directly by the programmer. Advanced users can employ user prompts to create an interactive program, or react to events such as sheets being loaded or changed.|$|E
50|$|After Musashi was {{effectively}} taken away {{and all of}} the hostages were set in a single group, the leader of the terrorists effectively saw through the false cover of a secret agent who had posed as a captured coach. After the leader then ordered the death of this undercover agent as to avoid a sudden unwanted conclusion, they set fire to their weapons to destroy this nuisance. Suddenly, these blows would be effectively evaded and Musashi would show her true self—a feared member of Ultimate Blue. By secretly replacing the terrorist's weapons with fakes, Musashi gains the upperhand and wins. The terrorist leader, however, presses the <b>command</b> <b>button</b> to release the set missiles atop their ship. To the immense surprise of the leader and everyone around Musashi, the ship is destroyed by an Ultimate Blue space satellite as it releases its destructive beam when the missiles are activated. Thus, the leader's plan was brought to its true conclusion and Ultimate Blue elaborated its hidden prowess once again.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{this flight}} would {{prove that the}} Atlas was still far from a reliable, man-rated booster. The launch {{proceeded}} normally until about T+20 seconds when the pitch and roll sequence failed to initiate and the vehicle instead just continued flying straight upward. As Mercury Flight Director Gene Kranz recalled, [...] "Seconds after the launch, a note of anxiety crept into the Welsh accent of Tec Roberts, the flight dynamics officer (FIDO) responsible for launch and orbital trajectory control, as he reported, 'Flight, negative roll-and-pitch program.' A collective shudder went through everyone {{in the control room}} as the controllers absorbed the chilling significance of Roberts’s terse report. The roll-and-pitch program normally changed the initial vertical trajectory of the launch into a more horizontal one that would take the Atlas out over the Atlantic. This Atlas was still inexplicably flying straight up, threatening the Cape and the surrounding communities. The worst-case scenario would be for it to pitch back toward land or explode. The higher it flew before it exploded, the wider the 'footprint' of debris scattered all over the Cape and surrounding area would be. The RSO (range safety officer) monitoring the launch confirmed the lack of a roll-and-pitch program, then continued to give the Atlas an opportunity to recover and start its track across the Atlantic. The RSO lifted the cover on the <b>command</b> <b>button</b> and watched as the Atlas raced to a fatal convergence with the limits on his plot board. At forty-three seconds after liftoff, Roberts reported, 'The range safety officer has transmitted the destruct command.' We waited, not speaking, counting the seconds, listening for the telltale, muffled krump that would signal the mission was over. Carl Huss, the retro controller (RETRO), responsible for reentry trajectory planning and operations, reported, 'Radar tracking multiple targets.' Roberts’s response echoed all our feelings: 'Chris, I’m sorry.' We sat by the consoles, not talking for several seconds. Then, one by one, the controllers closed their countdown books and started to pack their documents." ...|$|E

Opened in portrait mode, a standard numerical dialing pad along with two soft keys, send and end keys, a camera button, a voice <b>command</b> <b>button,</b> and four-directional buttons with an OK key in the center are all available. When in portrait, a user could input text using T9 (predictive text) or flip the phone horizontally for its full keyboard. The phone's 2.0 megapixel camera {{can take up to}} 1200 x 1600, and can record video at 176 x 144 at 15fps for the maximum of 10 minutes. The user could also use features in the camera like Night Shot, multi-shot, panorama, self-timer, and various filters. The smaller 128 x 128 1.3 inch display would also display what the camera would be showing when taking pictures of yourself. Opened horizontally, the full QWERTY keypad is usable and a simple button press allows switching between the various alphanumeric functions. Stereo speakers are mounted {{on either side of the}} 2.6-inch TFT display, with a resolution of 240 x 320 (QVGA). The battery is an 880 mAh which will give you 5 hours of talk time and 14 days stand-by. It had basic features, such as a tip calculator, alarm, calendar, voice memos, and a music player, which supported the MP3, WMA, ACC, and ACC+ formats, and could be controlled by the three touch sensitive buttons on the front of the display when the phone is closed. However, it lacked standard hardware that other manufactures were using at the time, such as micro USB and a 3.5mm headphone jack.

It makes use of constraints to position and shape objects. Simple primitive objects can be created and there is full support for Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG), which allows for the definition of complex objects using set operations on simpler objects. Objects can be positioned in the scene, scaled, rotated, copied, moved etc. The current view of the scene can be dynamically changed in all its parameters. There is support for lighting and a camera in the scene. Objects may be previewed using a chosen raytracer.
