40|$|There {{are three}} {{branches}} to this thesis: chromospheric resonator, forward modelling, and magnetic reconnection at different atmospheric heights. The first branch investigates the behaviour of resonant {{waves in the}} chromosphere above sunspot umbrae. The steep temperature gradients at the solar photosphere and transition region allow waves to be partially transmitted and partially reflected creating the boundaries of a resonating cavity. These resonant waves {{can be used to}} explain the existence of three-minute oscillations frequently observed above sunspot umbrae. 1 D numerical simulations have been performed of wave propagation along a magnetic field line perpendicular to the umbra to analyse the behaviour of this resonating cavity driven by <b>continuous</b> <b>random</b> <b>noise.</b> It was found that the gradient of the velocity spectra present in the corona is directly correlated with the size of the chromospheric cavity. This provides a potentially useful diagnostic for indirectly measuring chromospheric cavity size. The second branch uses line-of-sight integration to compare simulation data with observations. LOS integration has been performed on two cases: 1 D resonances above sunspot umbrae, and a 3 D simulation of a coronal kink instability. The LOS integration of resonant waves is an extension to the first branch of this thesis. The intensity was calculated using several coronal lines. It was found that the broadband of excited frequencies is correlated with chromospheric cavity size, providing a potentially useful diagnostic for chromospheric cavity size. For the kink-unstable loop, several Hinode/EIS lines were used to investigate the observational intensity and Doppler velocities. It was found that the intensity maps overestimate the loop width due to temporal and spatial degradation. Synthetic intensity maps were also generated using spectral lines from the DKIST/DL-NIRSP instrument. The final branch consists of a numerical investigation into the onset of 2 D magnetic reconnection in the solar photosphere, chromosphere and corona. The initial state is an equilibrium Harris current sheet. A reconnection event is triggered by applying a velocity driver perpendicular to the magnetic field. This external velocity driver allows us to study the early behaviour of reconnection in a naturalistic manner. The heating manifests differently across the different atmospheric layers. The photospheric heating is guided by the slow-mode shocks. The chromospheric heating is confined to the reconnection region. The ambipolar diffusion in the chromospheric case alters the distribution of the current on the inflow region in line with theoretical models...|$|E

Results on different kinds of stability are obtained. Computer simulations of the motion of a robot hand for an actual robot-manipulator are presented. 1 Introduction In this paper we continue the investigation from [1] and [6] of the motion of a single-link manipulatorrobot hand in the vertical plane. We consider a control circuit constructed on a proportionaldifferential controller and suppose that in the process of its realization several discontinuous and <b>continuous</b> <b>random</b> <b>noises</b> may appear. From the practical point of view the appearance of discontinuous noise is conditioned by the presence of jump type disturbances acting upon robot control systems in industry (for example in press section).

Sufficient conditions of asymptotic uniqueness of the least squares estimator of regression function parameters are obtained. This result {{is applied to the}} least squares estimator of amplitude and angular frequencies of harmonic oscillations sum observed on the background of given <b>random</b> <b>noise.</b> To obtain the main result limit theorems of random processes, weak convergence of a family of measures to the spectral measure of a regression function, etc. were used. The novelty, compared with the known results in the theory of periodogram estimator in observation models on weakly dependent noise, is assuming that the <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> is a local functional of Gaussian strongly dependent stationary process. The result can be used in the proof of the asymptotic normality of the least squares estimator of nonlinear regression model parameters with the help of Brower fixed point theorem. ??????????? ?????????? ?????? ????????? ? ??????????? ???????? ? ????????? ?????, ??????? ???????? ????????? ???????????? ?? ???????????? ????????????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????? ????????. ???????? ??????????? ??????? ??????????????? ?????????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????????. ???? ????????? ???????? ? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ???????? ? ??????? ?????? ????? ????????????? ?????????, ??????????? ?? ???? ?????????? ?????????? ????. ??? ????????? ????? ?????????? ??? ??????????? ?????????????? ??????? ?????????? ?????? ?????? ????????? ?????????, ?????? ?????????? ????????? ????? ??? ? ???????????? ???? ??????? ????????? ? ??. ?????, ?? ????????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ? ?????? ??????????????? ?????? ? ??????? ?????????? ?? ????? ????????? ?????, ???????? ???????????? ? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ????, ??????? ?????? ????? ????????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ?????????? ???????????? ????????????? ????????. ?????????? ????? ????? ????????? ? ?????????????? ??????????????? ???????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????? ????????? ? ?????????????? ??????? ??????? ? ??????????? ?????...|$|R

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an investigation of}} radar penetration imaging using ultra wideband (UWB) <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> waveforms from both theoretical and signal processing points of view. The principles governing the operation of a UWB <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> radar are discussed, including the analytical description of a UWB Gaussian process, the mathematical model and {{the implementation of a}} correlation receiver, and the range-Doppler resolution in <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> radar imaging. To address the problem of foliage penetration (FOPEN) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, a statistical-physical model for foliage transmission is developed and validated. Foliage obscuration impact on SAR images is analyzed by means of the paired-echo method. A comparative study between step-frequency and <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> SAR imaging is made to demonstrate the suitability of a <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> radar to be deployed as a FOPEN SAR. An experimental UWB <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> radar system is developed and field tested. In the signal processing aspect; a range sidelobe suppression technique called apodization filtering is developed to adopt the uncharacteristic point spread function (PSF) of a UWB <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> radar. The unique features for UWB radar penetration imaging are discussed and a 2 -D FOPEN <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> SAR imaging model is established. Based on this model, FOPEN <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> SAR image formation and processing techniques are developed. The impact of frequency and aspect dependent target signatures on the SAR images are studied. More dedicated image processing techniques in terms of better target detection, discrimination and identification, are also investigated.

A novel polarimetric <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> Ground Penetration Radar (GPR) system has been designed, fabricated and tested at UNL. Stokes vector-based polarimetric techniques are applied for data processing. This dissertation presents {{a review of the}} existing GPR systems, their salient features and limitations, fundamentals of electromagnetic theory for GPR applications, the <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> radar technique and its theoretical considerations, and the system test results using <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> polarimetry. ^ This novel polarimetric <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> radar system transmits the wide bandwidth <b>random</b> <b>noise</b> signal in the 1 - 2 GHz frequency range. Detection and localization of buried objects is accomplished by correlating the reflected waveform with a time-delayed replica of the transmitted waveform. Broadband dual-polarized log-periodic antennas are used for transmission and reception. A unique signal processing scheme is used to inject coherence into the system by frequency translation of the ultra-wideband signal by a coherent 160 MHz phase-locked source prior to performing heterodyne correlation. System coherence allows the extraction of the polarimetric amplitude and phase characteristics of a target. The raw data images and Stokes matrix and polarimetric factor images are presented to demonstrate results of the experimental study. ...|$|R
