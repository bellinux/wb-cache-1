5|$|After World War II, {{the world}} {{split into two}} large geopolitical blocs, {{separating}} into spheres of communism and capitalism. This led to the Cold War, during which the term First World was often used because of its political, social, and economic relevance. The term itself was first introduced in the late 1940s by the United Nations. Today, the First World is slightly outdated and has no official definition, however, it is generally {{thought of as the}} capitalist, industrial, wealthy and developed countries. This definition includes Australia & New Zealand, the developed <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> Asia (South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore) and the wealthy <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> North America and Europe, particularly Western Europe. In contemporary society, the First World is viewed as countries that have the most advanced economies, the greatest influence, the highest standards of living, and the greatest technology. After the Cold War, these <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> the First World included member states of NATO, U.S.-aligned states, neutral countries that were developed and industrialized, and the former British Colonies that were considered developed. It can be defined succinctly as Europe, plus the richer <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> the former British Empire (USA, Canada, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand), Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.|$|E

40|$|Research in {{the area}} of {{international}} marketing has shown that consumers’ assessments of product quality may change (positively/negatively) according to <b>country</b> <b>of</b> manufacture, <b>country</b> <b>of</b> design and/or <b>country</b> <b>of</b> parts of the products. While this notion has been established in the product context, no research has attempted to isolate similar effects <b>of</b> the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin construct in relation to service offerings. This research deconstructs the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin (COO) construct for international services along <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin of the brand (COB), <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin of where the service is delivered (COSD), and <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin of the person providing the service (CPI). A total of 143 respondents participated in the online survey undertaken in Australia. The service to be evaluated in the experiment was education service. Results of conjoint analysis in education service confirmed the effects and the importance of the proposed COO dimensions on consumers’ expectations of service quality. More specifically, the experiment revealed that CPI is more important than COB and COSD on consumers’ expectation of service quality. Daniel Aruan and Roberta Crouc...|$|R

Nowadays, people often discuss about <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin, {{the place where}} the product is produced, where the product comes from, where the product is assembled and designed.

Consumer tend to use <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin more as a decision tool when they make decision to purchase or when they purchase a product. The purpose of this research is to determine the influence <b>of</b> the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin to consumer attitude, the influence of attitude to purchase intention, and the influence <b>of</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin to purchase intention.
