5|$|Art {{director}} Jeremy Cook {{stated that}} maintaining readability and <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> the units and combat space was highest {{priority of the}} game's art direction.

The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with a greater emphasis on the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers such as David Morrison {{argue that}} the galactic equator is an entirely {{arbitrary}} line and can never be precisely drawn, because {{it is impossible to}} determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above , an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to. Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.|$|E

Cuarón uses the character, Stone, to illustrate <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> mind, persistence, training, and improvisation in the face of isolation and the consequences of a relentless Murphy's law. The film incorporates spiritual or existential themes, in the facts of Stone's daughter's accidental and meaningless death, and in the necessity of summoning the will to survive in the face of overwhelming odds, without future certainties, and with the impossibility of rescue from personal dissolution without finding this willpower. Calamities occur but only the surviving astronauts see them.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conceptual}} <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> this Feynman approach to QED, almost no early textbooks follow {{him in their}} presentation. When performing calculations {{it is much easier}} to work with the Fourier transforms of the propagators. Experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics are typically scattering experiments. In scattering theory, particles' momenta rather than their positions are considered, and it is convenient to think of particles as being created or annihilated when they interact. Feynman diagrams then look the same, but the lines have different interpretations. The electron line represents an electron with a given energy and momentum, with a similar interpretation of the photon line. A vertex diagram represents the annihilation of one electron and the creation of another together with the absorption or creation of a photon, each having specified energies and momenta.|$|E
5|$|For <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> presentation, the {{diagrams}} in {{this article}} are drawn with the components implemented in stripline format. This does not imply an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established printed circuit board manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E
40|$|When {{listening}} {{test subjects}} {{are required to}} rate changes in a single attribute, but also hear changes in other attributes, their ratings can become skewed by “dumping bias. ” To assess the influence of dumping bias on timbral “clarity” ratings, listeners {{were asked to rate}} stimuli: (i) in terms <b>of</b> <b>clarity</b> only; and (ii) in terms <b>of</b> <b>clarity,</b> warmth, fullness, and brightness. <b>Clarity</b> ratings <b>of</b> type (i) showed (up to 20 %) larger interquartile ranges than those of type (ii). It is concluded that in single-attribute timbral rating experiments, statistical noise—potentially resulting from dumping bias—can be reduced by allowing listeners to rate additional attributes either simultaneously or beforehand...|$|R

The Kruskal-Wallis test and a subsequent Mann-Whitney U test were used for multiple comparison analysis <b>of</b> the <b>clarity</b> levels. The χ-square test was used to compare the rate <b>of</b> assignment to <b>clarity</b> level 3 and combined (2 [*]+[*] 3) clarity levels for the four calculation methods and the two CT units as well as the <b>clarity</b> rates <b>of</b> the five-line sign among six locations on axial or oblique positions.

Inter-observer agreement for <b>clarity</b> levels <b>of</b> the five-line sign from different CT scanners and different algorithms was estimated by using weighted κ statistics [7].|$|R

5|$|Riesling is {{the second}} leading white grape varietal after the {{indigenous}} Grüner Veltliner. Austrian Riesling is generally thick bodied, coating the palate and producing a strong <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> flavour coupled with a mouthwatering aroma. A particular Austrian Riesling trademark is a long finish that includes hints of white pepper. It flourishes in the cool climate and free-draining granite and mica soil of the Wachau region where Austrian wine laws allow for irrigation. With levels normally around 13% it has a relatively high alcohol content for Riesling and is generally at its peak after 5 years. Austrian Riesling is not known for its sweetness and is mostly dry with very few grapes affected by botrytis.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, Garza's {{half-brother}} Moya {{testified against}} him and said Garza admitted he had received US$3,000 for Fischer's murder {{while he was in}} Brownsville. Garza's defense tried to discredit Moya's statements by saying he was facing drug offenses in Dallas, and was cooperating with prosecutors by testifying against Garza to receive a reduced sentence. Moya denied such arrangements were in place. He said the gun used at the murder scene was bought in Dallas while he was there, and he remembered seeing it in Garza's home in San Antonio. Records from the gun shop in Dallas showed Garza bought the same type of gun on February 1, 1993. In addition, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigator testified he helped record the suspect's conversations, while a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) technician helped improve the <b>clarity</b> <b>of</b> the tapes. The defense attorneys brought in experts to discredit the recordings, and to prove they had been tampered with.|$|E
