40|$|The {{purchasing}} function plays a strategic {{role in a}} company’s ability to compete. As globalization continues to increase, what becomes interesting is the effect that national culture may have on <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> and, ultimately, manufacturing competitiveness. This study examines the effects of <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> and the <b>purchasing</b> function’s involvement with corporate strategy on manufacturing competitiveness as it is affected by national differences. In particular, {{we are interested in}} the research question: Do purchasing theories built on samples from mainly North American and Western European countries apply in other countries with different cultural contexts? The statistical results provide evidence that the engagement and efficacy of <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> and strategic involvement within companies vary by national culture. Moreover, a particular cultural dimension, Long-term orientation, is significantly related to the efficacy of <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> and strategic involvement. This finding has important implications from the perspective of purchasing decision-making in global operations. Specifically, top managers from different nations could adopt and implement similar <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities,</b> but those activities could lead to different outcomes depending on the culture. The paper concludes by reviewing research limitations and suggests further examination of operations management theories...|$|R
40|$|<b>Purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> {{are defined}} as the {{essential}} activities associated with the acquisition of the materials, services and equipment used in a business organisation. They are significant functions because they help organisations to realise many benefits such as cost reduction, improved material delivery, a shorter cycle time, access to product and process technology and quality improvement. This can only be achieved if an organisation performs its <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> effectively and efficiently. There are four purchasing development frameworks, or models, that are helpful in evaluating the <b>purchasing</b> <b>activity</b> in an organization. These are: Stannack, P. and Jones, M. (1988) Model, Reck and Long, (1988) Model, Jones, D. M., (1999) Model and Arjan V. (2000), Model. However, {{it was concluded that}} these models were nonoperational and merely indicate the stage of development of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>activity.</b> The shortfall of these approaches is that they have no "standard" development criteria that organizations can follow to evaluate their <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities.</b> These models also have a limited number of development measurement variables. In an attempt to overcome these shortfalls and identify factors that affect purchasing improvements, a purchasing development model was developed. The aim of this research is to produce a new purchasing maturity model (PurchMM) based {{on a wide variety of}} purchasing parameters that have been discovered during the literature review. The Readiness PurchMM describes an evolutionary improvement path for purchasing function from an ad hoc, immature process to a mature, well-organized one. Five levels of maturity encompass this path. The Readiness PurchMM guides purchasing functions that wants to gain control of their <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> for improving, developing the performance of the purchasing functions, maintainin...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} Multi-Agent {{simulation}} model to investigate <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> in an organizational environment. Starting point is the observation {{that the majority of}} <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> in organizations is usually performed without any involvement of the organization's purchasing department. The purpose of the experiments is to investigate if and how certain factors determine the degree to which Purchasing professionals become involved in the purchasing of Non-Product Related (NPR) items and services. Among the factors investigated are: corporate purchasing policies, available information, {{and the nature of the}} various <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities.</b> Preliminary results show that the behavior of the multi-agent simulation model is an acceptable representation of reality. Furthermore, the results show the limits of a Purchasing department's added value and the important role of organizational learning in that respect.

40|$|It is {{reported}} that all items concerning a product, such as brand name, commercial, price, package design and others, which {{are described in}} Part 1, give a remarkable effect on forecasting of consumers' purchasing activitiy. Therefore, in case of forecasting of consumers' <b>purchasing</b> <b>activity,</b> it will be demanded to formulate forecasting problem, considering quantitatively {{the effects of these}} all items. This paper presents a probabilistic method to assess the <b>purchasing</b> <b>activity</b> of a new product which is designed by developer with some specified image level of selected items within all items, developing Bayes theory with the likelihood function obtained by the statistical analysis of the selling results of products or the questionnaire surveys. Besides, a probabilistic approach using fuzzy logic as a means to define numerically each image level of all items is formulated and discussed with numerical examples. It is hoped that such a tentative study will help to forecast consumers' <b>purchasing</b> <b>activity</b> for new product with some specified image level of selected items...|$|R
40|$|Today {{the retail}} sector {{distribution}} channels for fruits and vegetables, heading towards Swedish consumers, often involve large channel members as producer organisations, distributors and retailers working with cost efficient {{economies of scale}} and <b>centralised</b> <b>purchasing</b> organisations. These circumstances {{make it difficult for}} growers operating on a small scale. In their wish to expand market shares small producers need to get a deeper understanding about the possible channels of distribution and their members, structure, strategies, relationships, purchasing organisation, demands and requirements. This case study presents an analysis on how these issues affect small farmers and how these factors differ between studied channels and their members in order to help small suppliers to be more competitive so that they can obtain new market shares. Based on the result of analysis, a set of recommendations has been proposed. Keywords Purchasing, requirements, supplier selection...|$|R

40|$|Adoption {{of global}} key account {{management}} systems typically represents a response by selling companies to two inter-related structural {{changes in their}} business environment: first, the growing internationalisation of their industry and unprecedented levels of foreign competition; and second, the urgent need to retain customers of strategic importance (i. e. key accounts) {{against a background of}} <b>centralised</b> <b>purchasing</b> and supply base rationalisation. Global key account management is central to the ongoing, and often acrimonious debate captured in the slogan, "Think Global, Act Local", suggesting serious implications for organisation structure, co-ordination/control and relationship management. Yet global key account management is under-researched and its efficacy, therefore, only partially understood.

30|$|First, Complicated Dependency on Context (CDC) Game props are {{not only}} {{dependent}} on the <b>purchase</b> <b>activities</b> of players but also heavily relevant to the elaborated game contexts, e.g., the prop “yellow scarves armor” {{can be obtained by}} all players from “traitors” team on location “D”, and only can be equipped as a major prop for the character “Jiao” in the game of “Three Kingdoms”. That is, props can be dependent on lots of features, and even worse, player intentions for buying certain props may depend on the game events which are not directly related to the <b>purchase</b> <b>activities.</b> These kinds of complicated contexts can be neither well captured by CF nor easily measured in CBR with ordinary similarity functions.|$|R

40|$|Increased {{demand from}} the market to carry out rapid {{business}} transactions has led many companies to seek to improve their regular business transactions. The progressive development of the internet in establishing a variety of electronic marketplaces has facilitated companies to move towards applying e-procurement technologies. This indirectly increases the competitiveness of companies due to well managed <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> using e-procurement technologies. The strategic decision by the top management in implementing e-procurement technologies is mainly concentrated on managing the supply of external resources and preferred {{to focus on the}} implementation of green supply chain activities to increase the environmental performance with e-procurement technologies. With the spread of internet technologies, which led to changes in business strategy and its uses, companies will be provided with a digital platform for online business transactions. Therefore, business through electronic media (e-media) have the potential and power to transform business transactions and business relationships. E-procurement became the most important strategy for the business to purchase or procure goods or materials from global suppliers. Despite the claims on usability of e-procurement technologies, some companies however show little interest in applying e-procurement technologies because of the difficulty the companies to perform <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> and other key aspects that influence the companies to exploit the technologies. As a major contributor to the growth of the agriculture sector, the Malaysia Palm Oil Industry (MPOI) should explore the potential of e-procurement and other relevant technologies to be exploited in the industry and enhance its competitiveness. The information on the applicability of e-procurement technologies for different types of materials at different stages of the industry supply chain will assist the industry players to achieve efficient <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities.</b> Hence, in this chapter the case study discussed will provide relevant e-procurement solutions with respect to the MPOI and will provide comprehensive <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> of different types of products along the supply chain through e-procurement technologies...|$|R

First, it is still very unclear how global <b>purchasing</b> <b>activities</b> in global sourcing organizations are integrated and academic articles on integration are extremely scarce (Matthyssens & Faes 1997). Secondly, despite a clear trend towards hybrid global sourcing organizations (Johnson & Leenders 2004), many companies are struggling with the implementation of it (Narasimhan & Carter 1989; Trent & Monczka 2003). We explain how well-established concepts and theoretical ideas from organization theory literature could increase the understanding of integration needs and mechanisms in the global sourcing context. 1...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{claim that}} the <b>purchase</b> <b>activities</b> can be {{triggered}} {{by a set of}} hidden events and the player information should be organized into multi-instance bags. In multi-instance representation, we treat each event record, like “ID: 187759, Player ID: 16749, Time 11 : 20 p.m., Date 12 - 04 - 2014, Location coordinate (12, 14), Type attack, etc”, as an instance, and all instances from one player are in one bag. For facilitating the description, an illustration is shown in Fig.  2. As shown in Fig.  2, each player is represented as a bag which contains large number of instances. Each instance in a bag describes an event, either hidden event or user <b>purchase</b> <b>activity.</b> The events are with feature ID, Player ID, Timestamp, etc. An example of the complicated dependency and long-distance intervention is also shown in Fig.  2, which is marked with red right-arrows. The example indicates that the <b>purchase</b> <b>activity</b> of prop p is related to two hidden events i and j which occur with different timestamp. It is obvious that we can treat the props which were (or would be potentially) bought as the labels. One player could buy more than one prop to improve the game characters abilities; therefore, one bag can map to multiple labels, i.e., Fig.  2 essentially offers a multi-instance multi-label representation. Then, the game props recommendation task can be cast into an MIML prediction problem.|$|R
30|$|It {{is notable}} that the {{mentioned}} event {{is not directly}} related to the <b>purchase</b> <b>activity,</b> and is, therefore, denoted as a hidden event.
