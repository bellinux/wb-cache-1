The yields and product distribution obtained from the HTL of Chlorella vulgaris have been investigated. High conversion of algae to biocrude as well as near <b>complete</b> <b>gasification</b> of the remaining organic components in the aqueous phase was achieved.

The amount of hydrogen produced was compared to the amounts needed for complete hydrotreating of the biocrude. A maximum of 0. 29 g H 2 was produced through HTG per gram of biocrude produced by HTL.

The work aims at comparing, for different fuels, the second principle theoretical efficiencies of air gasification and oxygen-steam gasification.

According to the results obtained, air gasification operated on biomass fuels shows higher exergetic efficiency values compared to oxygen gasification for the Carbon Deposition Boundary and 1200 K conditions tested; this demonstrates the suitability of using air as oxidizer. To provide a complete discussion, a modified equilibrium model able to account for the main non-equilibrium effects was applied to evaluate the exergetic efficiency of biomass fuels under real gasification conditions...|$|R

40|$|A {{new model}} {{proposed}} for the gasification of chars and carbons incorporates features of the turbostratic nanoscale structure that exists in such materials. The model also considers the effect of initial surface chemistry and different reactivities perpendicular to the edges and to {{the faces of the}} underlying crystallite planes comprising the turbostratic structure. It may be more realistic than earlier models based on pore or grain structure idealizations when the carbon contains large amounts of crystallite matter. Shrinkage of the carbon particles in the chemically controlled regime is also possible due to the random <b>complete</b> <b>gasification</b> of crystallitic planes. This mechanism can explain observations in the literature of particle size reduction. Based on the model predictions, both initial surface chemistry and the number of stacked planes in the crystallites strongly influence the reactivity and particle shrinkage.

Model parameters are determined entirely from rate measurements...|$|E
30|$|At the {{chemical}} equilibrium state, the yields of H 2 and CO 2 increase {{with the increasing}} residence time, but the yield of CH 4 and CO decreases sharply, which is shown in Fig.  2 b. Initially H 2 and CO 2 were 49 and 23  % of the yield which is slow; and after 30  min they gradually increased and at 60  min, they reached up to 88.8 and 50  %. But {{in the case of}} CH 4 and CO it decreased from 27 and 16  % to 10 − 3  mol/kg. Longer residence time can improve gasification thoroughness, but there is also an inverse relationship between temperature and reaction completeness, dropping from a few minutes below 600  °C to a few seconds above 600  °C. The optimal temperature threshold for SCWG (i.e., 600  °C) has been shown on the lower side of the conversion range for higher concentration biomass {{in the absence of a}} catalyst [23, 24, 25, 26]. From the viewpoint of thermodynamics, biomass can be gasified completely in SCW with a product formation of H 2 and CO 2, but adequate reaction time was required to <b>complete</b> the <b>gasification</b> process. Short residence times and high organics destruction efficiencies occur during gasification and oxidative reactions at supercritical operating conditions above 600  °C [27].|$|R
40|$|Biomass {{gasification}} is {{a developing}} reality in Europe. This technology allows exploiting residual biomass {{as well as}} promoting the decentralized production of electricity and heat (CHP). However, despite {{the simplicity of the}} gasification reaction, the installation and conduction of a gasification process require an accurate planning, involving economic, environmental, social, safety and process management issues. As a consequence demo facilities and case studies are required to enhance the development and diffusion of this technology. This work aims at analyzing a <b>complete</b> biomass <b>gasification</b> chain for CHP purposes. Four steps can be identified in the conversion chain: biomass production, biomass conditioning, syngas production and cleaning, syngas utilization. Fuel, electricity, materials and utilities consumption, as well as major airborne emissions, wastewater and solid residues are determined for each step of the chain, providing a comprehensive approach to the problem in order to indentify global index for the technical and environmental performances of the chain. The biomass production step is developed on the basis of an existing scenario (the S. Rossore natural reserve in Pisa.) which provides in field data and information. The performances of the conditioning and gasification plant are obtained from literature sources and data sheets of commercial equipments. Special attention is devoted to the gas clean-up providing a survey of problems and technologies associated with syngas cleaning. Two different gas cleaning systems are taken into account, a “traditional” wet gas clean-up line (based on water scrubbing and filters) and an “advanced” hot gas clean-up line (based on a dolomite bed with air injection for tar cracking and syngas sensible heat recovery with an air heat exchanger). The performance of wet gas clean-up and the hot gas clean up are derived from the work of Sharan et al. (1997) and Van de Beld et al. (1997), respectively. The syngas utilization section includes an IC-Engine for CHP applications, data about efficiency and emissions are obtained both from literature sources as well as data sheets of commercial equipments. First an inventory of the energy and mass fluxes is made; subsequently energy and mass balances are carried out for the two systems. The energy flow analysis shows that for the wet gas clean-up the most significant energy loss is due to syngas cooling to other energy losses. Notably in the case of hot tar abatement part of the syngas sensible heat is recovered thus allowing to reduce the fuel demand of the plant, if a suitable heat demand is available in the plant (for instance additional chips drying). However since part of the syngas chemical energy is lost in the partial oxidation in the dolomite bed, the overall energy efficiency of this chain is lower compared to the wet gas clean-up. The hot clean-up flow-sheet is more complex and expensive than the wet clean-up because it is specifically designed to meet tight IC-Engine specifications (in order to improve the engine lifetime and reduce emissions) which cannot be safely met with the wet clean-up. Although this work cannot clearly state which one is the best syngas cleaning system, it highlights the energy and material fluxes of a <b>complete</b> biomass <b>gasification</b> to CHP chain and can be a useful basis for a more comprehensive LCIA study...|$|R
40|$|Char, {{the major}} {{co-product}} of mild coal gasification, represents about 70 {{percent of the}} total product yield. The only viable use for the char is in the production of formed coke. Early work to develop formed coke used char from a pilot plant sized mild gasification unit (MGU), which was based on commercial units of the COALITE plant in England. Formed coke was made at a bench-scale production level using MGU chars from different coals. An evolutionary formed coke development process over a two-year period resulted in formed coke production at bench-scale levels that met metallurgical industries` specifications. In an ASTM D 5341 reactivity test by a certified lab, the coke tested CRI 30. 4 and CSR 67. 0 which is excellent. The standard is CRI 55. In 1991, a continuous 1000 pounds per hour coal feed mild coal gasification pilot plant (CMGU) was <b>completed.</b> The <b>gasification</b> unit is a heated unique screw conveyor designed to continuously process plastic coal, vent volatiles generated by pyrolysis of coal, and convert the plastic coal to free flowing char. The screw reactor auxiliary components are basic solids materials handling equipment. The screw reactor will convert coal to char and volatile co-products at a rate greater than 1000 pounds per hour of coal feed. Formed coke from CMGU char is comparable to that from the MGU char. In pilot-plant test runs, up to 20 tons of foundry coke were produced. Three formed coke tests at commercial foundries were successful. In all of the cupola tests, the iron temperature and composition data indicated that the formed coke performed satisfactorily. No negative change in the way the cupola performed was noticed. The last 20 -ton test was 100 percent CTC/DOE coke. With conventional coke in this cupola charging rates were 10 charges per hour. The formed coke charges were 11 to 12 charges per hour. This equates to a higher melt rate. A 10 percent increase in cupola production would be a major advantage. 13 figs., 13 tabs...|$|R

However, {{in spite of its}} potential, the use of bagasse as a source of energy is not so common. Bagasse, in fact, is considered a difficult fuel due to its fibrous nature, low bulk density and high moisture content, and the use of conventional stoker-fired combustors does not clearly show the economic feasibility of the process. Moreover, the high efficiency fluidized-bed technology cannot be directly applied to bagasse due to the difficulties associated with its fluidization. In this work, a two-stage gasification reactor is proposed for bagasse gasification. Bench scale gasification tests indicate that this reactor allows a <b>complete</b> <b>gasification</b> of biomass avoiding the formation of carbon and tar.

40|$|Energy is {{necessary}} for human beings existence, which supports for the modernization of the community. Biomass {{has been one of}} the main energy sources of mankind ever since the dawn of civilization, though its significance subsided after the Second World War due to the cheaper and easily useable fossil fuels (oil and gas). In developing countries, biomass is a main source of energy in rural areas. Mostly the biomass is burned open to the atmosphere to get heat energy, which lost a huge amount of energy and also increases the air pollution. Due to the depletion and excessive use of fossil fuel resources, the prices of petroleum products are increasing day by day. In Pakistan, agriculture sector is suffer very badly due to unavailability and high cost of energy as the major source of farm power are diesel engines and tractors, which increases the cost of production. Gasification is the most reliable and best alternate to get the energy from the biomass. Gasifiers are the reactors which converts the solid fuels into the gaseous fuels. The biomass can easily be converted into useful gas which can be used to run engines comprehensively. Keeping these points in mind, a research study was carried out at the workshop, Department of Farm Machinery and Power, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan. In this study, <b>complete</b> small scale <b>gasification</b> system was designed and fabricated to run 15 to 18. 64 kW (20 - 25 hp) diesel engine for tube well to reduce the cost of operation. Downdraft and updraft type gasifiers were designed and fabricated for the production of producer gas. A conditioning unit (cooling and cleaning units) was also fabricated for upgrading producer gas to internal combustion engine quality fuel. The whole system was then evaluated for its performance with different aspects. Completely randomized design (CRD) was used to statistically analyze the collected data. The average gas produced in the downdraft gasifier was found to be 74. 26 m 3 and in updraft gasifier was 69. 72 m 3 with same (30 kg) quantity of different biomass fuel. The data revealed that in downdraft gasifier, 2. 64 m 3 /kg, 2. 21 m 3 /kg and 2. 58 m 3 /kg of producer gas was produced from charcoal, corncobs and coal respectively.

Perform gasification modeling in support of INEL and commercial customers. The major accomplishments of this project corresponding to these objectives are as follows: 1. Original data for black liquor and biomass data demonstrate dependencies of particle reactions on particle size, liquor type, gas temperature, and gas composition. A comprehensive particle submodel and corresponding data developed during this project predicts particle drying (including both free and chemisorbed moisture), devolatilization, heterogeneous char oxidation, char-smelt reactions, and smelt oxidation. Data and model predictions agree, without adjustment of parameters, within their respective errors. The work performed under these tasks substantially exceeded the original objectives. 2. A separate model for sulfur scavenging and fume formation in a recovery boiler demonstrated strong dependence on both in-boiler mixing and chemistry. In particular, accurate fume particle size predictions, as determined from both laboratory and field measurements, depend on gas mixing effects in the boilers that lead to substantial particle agglomeration. Sulfur scavenging was quantitatively predicted while particle size required one empirical mixing factor to match data. 3. Condensed-phase thermochemistry algorithms were developed for salt mixtures and compared with sodium-based binary and higher order systems. Predictions and measurements were demonstrated for both salt systems and for some more complex silicate-bearing systems, substantially exceeding the original scope of this work. 4. A multi-dimensional model of char bed reactivity developed under this project demonstrated that essentially all reactions in char beds occur on or near the surface, with the internal portions of the bed being essentially inert. The model predicted composition, temperature, and velocity profiles in the bed and showed that air jet penetration is limited to the immediate vicinity of the char bed, with minimal impact on most of the bed. The modeling efforts substantially exceeded the original scope of this project. 5.

This paper focuses {{on the process of}} biomass gasification, where the synthesis gas may subsequently be used for the production of electricity, fuels and chemicals.

40|$|Due to the irreversibilities {{that occur}} during biomass gasification, gasifiers {{are usually the}} least {{efficient}} units in the systems for production of heat, electricity, or other biofuels. Internal thermal energy exchange is responsible for a part of these irreversibilities and can be reduced {{by the use of}} preheated air as a gasifying medium. The focus of the paper is biomass gasification in the whole range of gasification temperatures by the use of air preheated with product gas sensible heat. The energetic and exergetic analyses are carried with a typical ash-free biomass feed represented by CH 1. 4 O 0. 59 N 0. 0017 at 1 and 10 bar pressure. The tool for the analyses is already validated model extended with a heat exchanger model. For every 200 K of air preheating, the average decrease of the amount of air required for complete biomass gasification is 1. 3 % of the amount required for its stoichiometric combustion. The air preheated to the gasification temperature on the average increases the lower heating value of the product gas by 13. 6 %, as well as energetic and exergetic efficiencies of the process. The optimal air preheating temperature is the one that causes gasification to take place at the point where all carbon is consumed. It exists only if the amount of preheated air is less than the amount of air at ambient temperature required for <b>complete</b> <b>gasification</b> at a given pressure.

Preliminary tests of algae gasification {{were done with}} quartz capillaries at varying operating conditions such as temperature (400 − 700 °C), reaction time (1 − 15 min), {{and the addition of}} catalysts. The dry gas composition of uncatalyzed gasification of algae in SCW mainly comprised of CO 2, CO, CH 4, H 2, and some C 2 −C 3 compounds. Higher temperatures, low algae concentrations, and longer residence times favored the algae gasification efficiency (GE). The addition of catalysts to the capillaries resulted in higher yields of hydrogen and lower CO yields via enhanced water−gas shift activity. The addition of catalysts accelerated the gasification efficiency up to a maximum of 84 % at 600 °C and 2 min reaction time with nickel-based catalysts. <b>Complete</b> <b>gasification</b> is achieved at higher temperatures (700 °C) and with excess amounts of (Ru/TiO 2) catalyst.

The amino acids l-alanine and glycine have a minor effect on the gasification process of glycerol, and a significant reduction of the gasification efficiency was observed in the presence of l-proline. Coke formation and colorization of the reactor effluent were more noticeable with glycerol−amino acid mixtures. In the absence of amino acids, the glycerol solution gasified without any coke formation and colorization of the reactor effluent. Again this effect was more pronounced in the presence of l-proline.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to experimentally investigate the performance of steam gasification of chars of pure coal (lignite, sub-bituminous), pure biomass (radiata pine, eucalyptus nitens) and their blends. The influences of gasification temperature, types of coal and biomass, coal-biomass blending ratio, alkali and alkaline earth metal (AAEM) in lignite, on specific gasification characteristics (producer gas composition and yield, char reactivity) were studied. In addition, synergistic effects in co-gasification of coal-biomass blend char were also investigated. This project is in accordance with objectives of the BISGAS Consortium. In this study, experiments were performed in a bench-scale gasifier at gasification temperatures of 850 °C, 900 °C and 950 °C, respectively. Two types of coals (lignite and sub-bituminous) and two kinds of biomass (radiata pine and eucalyptus nitens) from New Zealand were selected as sample fuels. From these raw materials, the chars with coal-to-biomass blending ratios of 0 : 100 (pure coal), 20 : 80, 50 : 50, 80 : 20 and 100 : 0 (pure biomass), which were derived through the devolatilization at temperature of 900 °C for 7 minutes, were gasified with steam as gasification agent. During the gasification tests, the producer gas composition and gas production were continuously analysed using a Micro gas chromatograph. When the gas production was undetectable, the gasification process {{was assumed to be}} <b>completed</b> and the <b>gasification</b> time was recorded. The gasification producer gas consisted of three main gas components: hydrogen (H 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). The results from gasification of chars of individual solid fuels (coal or biomass) confirmed that biomass char gasification was faster than coal char gasification. The influences of gasification temperatures were shown as: when gasification temperature increased, the H 2 yield increased in coal char gasification but decreased in biomass char gasification. In the meantime, CO yields increased while CO 2 yields decreased in both coal char and biomass char gasification. In addition, the char reactivity of all the pure fuel samples increased with elevated gasification temperatures. The results from co-gasification of coal-biomass blend char exhibited that the syngas production rate, which is defined as the total gas production divided by the gasification completion time, was enhanced by an increase in gasification temperatures as well as an increase in the biomass proportion in the blend. The AAEM species played a significant catalytic role in both gasification of pure coal chars and co-gasification of coal-biomass blend chars. The presence of AAEM increased the producer gas yield and enhanced the char reactivity. The positive synergistic effects of the coal-biomass blending char on syngas production rate only existed in the co-gasification of lignite-eucalyptus nitens blend chars.

Coal gasification is one of these processes, which is nowadays considered as a promising technology for the chemical industry. This study is devoted to the coal char physical structure, {{which is one of the}} most important parameters influencing coal gasification reaction. First, this study presents the extensive literature review of the char physical structure role during its conversion. Collection of the char structural properties as well as their changes during char conversion are shown and discussed. Literature review is followed by the experimental investigations. Chars prepared from two brown coals (Lusatian and Rhenish) were gasified in a laboratory scale fluidized bed reactor in CO 2 at temperatures of 800, 850, 900, and 950 °C and atmospheric pressure. Char samples were gasified completely as well as partially in order to evaluate the reaction kinetics and char structural changes during the reaction, respectively. <b>Complete</b> <b>gasification</b> curves were evaluated by different methods, including application of three gasification models (the Random Pore Model, the Volume Reaction Model, and the Shrinking Reaction Model), instantaneous reaction rate approach as well as the self-developed surface-related reaction rate approach. The results of different approaches were compared. This study also presents a comprehensive methodology to analyze coal char physical structure. The variety of measurement techniques (gas physical adsorption, mercury porosimetry, helium pycnometry, SEM, etc.) were applied to assess structural properties of the char, such as specific surface area, particle density, porosity, pore size and shape, structure morphology, etc. Problems associated with the choice of a proper measurement technique and the comparability of the data delivered by different techniques were discussed. The main objective of the study was to link char structural changes to the char gasification kinetics. The specific task of this thesis was to investigate pore size in relation to their availability for the reaction. As such, specific surface areas of pores of different sizes (from sub-micro to mesopores) were correlated to the instantaneous reaction rates. Both chars exhibit similar trends in their structural changes during gasification, although the absolute values differ, especially with respect to the pores of microscale. Furthermore, structural changes were caused not only by the reaction but also by the influence of the heat treatment, especially at the earlier stages of the reaction. The most reasonable correlation has been achieved between the instantaneous reaction rate and the specific surface area of mesopores. Sub-micro- and micropores did not govern the gasification reaction under given conditions. Finally, kinetic parameters derived from different evaluation methods were reapplied in order to test their ability to predict the experimental data. Each of the method has its advantages and disadvantages as used for the kinetic evaluation. The results of this study represent a substantive base of the experimentally derived data concerning physical structure and morphology of coal char. The findings can be used in numerical and simulation studies for development, validation, and improvement of the models which consider coal particle as a reactive porous solid...|$|E
40|$|Injection of coal-water {{slurries}} (CWS) {{made with}} both waste coal and bituminous coal was tested for enhanced reduction of NO{sub x} and Hg emissions at the AES Beaver Valley plant near Monaca, PA. Under this project, Breen Energy Solutions (BES) conducted field experiments on the these emission reduction technologies by mixing coal fines and/or pulverized coal, urea {{and water to}} form slurry, then injecting the slurry in the upper furnace region of a coal-fired boiler. The main focus of this project was use of waste coal fines as the carbon source; however, testing was also conducted using pulverized coal in conjunction with or instead of waste coal fines for conversion efficiency and economic comparisons. The host site for this research and development project was Unit No. 2 at AES Beaver Valley cogeneration station. Unit No. 2 is a 35 MW Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) front-wall fired boiler that burns eastern bituminous coal. It has low NO{sub x} burners, overfire air ports and a urea-based selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) system for NO{sub x} control. The back-end clean-up system includes a rotating mechanical ash particulate removal and electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) scrubber. Coal slurry injection was expected to help reduce NOx emissions in two ways: (1) Via fuel-lean reburning when the slurry is injected above the combustion zone. (2) Via enhanced SNCR reduction when urea is incorporated into the slurry. The mercury control process under research uses carbon/water slurry injection to produce reactive carbon in-situ in the upper furnace, promoting the oxidation of elemental mercury in flue gas from coal-fired power boilers. By controlling the water content of the slurry below the stoichiometric requirement for <b>complete</b> <b>gasification,</b> water activated carbon (WAC) can be generated in-situ in the upper furnace. As little as 1 - 2 % coal/water slurry (heat input basis) can be injected and generate sufficient WAC for mercury capture. During July, August, and September 2007, BES designed, procured, installed, and tested the slurry injection system at Beaver Valley. Slurry production was performed by Penn State University using equipment that was moved from campus to the Beaver Valley site. Waste coal fines were procured from Headwaters Inc. and transported to the site in Super Sacks. In addition, bituminous coal was pulverized at Penn State and trucked to the site in 55 -gallon drums. This system was operated for three weeks during August and September 2007. NO{sub x} emission data were obtained using the plant CEM system. Hg measurements were taken using EPA Method 30 B (Sorbent Trap method) both downstream of the electrostatic precipitator and in the stack. Ohio Lumex Company was on site to provide rapid Hg analysis on the sorbent traps during the tests. Key results from these tests are: (1) Coal Fines reburn alone reduced NO{sub x} emissions by 0 - 10 % with up to 4 % heat input from the CWS. However, the NO{sub x} reduction was accompanied by higher CO emissions. The higher CO limited our ability to try higher reburn rates for further NO{sub x} reduction. (2) Coal Fines reburn with Urea (Carbon enhanced SNCR) decreased NO{sub x} emissions by an additional 30 % compared to Urea injection only. (3) Coal slurry injection did not change Hg capture across the ESP at full load with an inlet temperature of 400 - 430 F. The Hg capture in the ESP averaged 40 %, with or without slurry injection; low mercury particulate capture is normally expected across a higher temperature ESP because any oxidized mercury is thought to desorb from the particulate at ESP temperatures above 250 F. (4) Coal slurry injection with halogen salts added to the mixing tank increased the Hg capture in the ESP to 60 %. This significant incremental mercury reduction is important to improved mercury capture with hot-side ESP operation and wherever hindrance from sulfur oxides limit mercury reduction, because the higher temperature is above sulfur oxide dew point interference...|$|E
