50|$|All group 4 {{subjects}} (except {{computer science}} and environmental systems and societies; see below) follow {{roughly the same}} format. Each subject has its Subject Specific Core (SSC), i.e., material taught at both the standard and higher levels. Students sitting the Higher Level examination study the Additional Higher Level (AHL) material. Lastly, there {{is a list of}} options for each subject from which two are chosen. Higher Level students are sometimes unable to choose certain options that are available to Standard Level students because the AHL already covers it. Ideally, students <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>options</b> based on their own abilities and preferences, but in practice the options are usually chosen by the school (based on the school's scientific facilities as well as the discretion of the instructor). Students spend one-quarter of the 150 hours of SL instruction (240 hours for HL; however, both numbers are merely recommendations and are not enforced) doing practical work in the laboratory. Group 4 subjects at the Standard Level are tailored for students who do not see themselves in further science instruction after leaving the programme.|$|E
50|$|The {{integrated}} reasoning section {{includes four}} question types: table analysis, graphics interpretation, multi-source reasoning, and two-part analysis. In the table analysis section, test takers {{are presented with}} a sortable table of information, similar to a spreadsheet, which has to be analyzed. Each question will have several statements with opposite-answer options (e.g., true/false, yes/no), and test takers click on the correct option. Graphics interpretation questions ask test takers to interpret a graph or graphical image. Each question has fill-in-the-blank statements with pull-down menus; test takers must <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>options</b> that make the statements accurate. Multi-source reasoning questions are accompanied by two to three sources of information presented on tabbed pages. Test takers click on the tabs and examine all the relevant information, which may {{be a combination of}} text, charts, and tables to answer either traditional multiple-choice or opposite-answer (e.g., yes/no, true/false) questions. Two-part analysis questions involve two components for a solution. Possible answers are given in a table format with a column for each component and rows with possible options. Test takers have to choose one response per column.|$|E

40|$|Energy policy analysts (Hausman [1979], Hartman [1984], Houston [1983], Hutton [1980], and Olsen [1984]) {{increasingly}} rely on some {{notion of}} life-cycle costing for predicting how consumers will choose among alternative energy-using durable-good investments. These techniques {{have been important}} for understanding and analyzing the household purchase of new, relatively-untested appliance technologies (such as solar water heaters and more efficient refrigerators), new energy sources (such as solar photovoltaics), and capital-intensive conservation investments (such as increased home insulation, storm windows, and water heat wraps). In all of these cases, consumers face options in which a higher capital cost will purchase lower operating costs {{over the life of}} the particular pieces of equipment. We assume consumers evaluate these energy-using durables as they would any other investment. They compare and discount, {{over the life of the}} investments, the costs and financial benefits of alternatives and <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>option(s)</b> offering the largest expected benefit. ...|$|E

The average price of a new car is over $ 9, 000, and that's for a basic model with no options. In addition, there are over 500 different models on the market. No wonder many consumers find shopping for a car so frustrating. In fact, some consumers are willing to pay a Maryland "auto psychologist " $ 200 to analyze their needs, help them choose the right car, and negotiate the deal. While buying a car is not a simple process, you can make it easier by following these basic steps: Step 1. Decide what type and style car you need.

40|$|In the {{psychology}} of consumption, with joy as well as pride, with delight as well as hope, {{it is critical to}} understand the role of positive emotions in shaping consumers' experiences, judgments and choices. A common assumption is that it is good to feel good, that consumers always <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>options</b> that elicit more positive feelings, and that the ability to generate positive emotions is unvaryingly rewarded with favorable behaviors such as loyalty. This dissertation goes beyond the pleasure principle of human motivation and argues that, rather than uniformly pursuing pleasure or invariably reiterating the choices that have produced pleasure in the past, consumers do not always follow and sometimes even avoid positive emotions in the service of other consumption goals. People do not always return to the places they like or buy the products they love, no matter how strong their feelings. This dissertation explores how consumers adapt their emotional responses and their affect-laden behaviors to meet the motivational and situational demands of the task at hand. In attempting to understand the contingencies of emotional responding, affect is viewed as a highly versatile system that provides consumers with a rich repertoire of affective response options that can be flexibly employed. In this way, it shows that the path to good consumption decisions often entails leaving pleasure. ...|$|E

40|$|How {{often have}} you walked {{around in the}} {{supermarket}} {{trying to decide what}} product by which brand to <b>choose?</b> <b>The</b> <b>options</b> are many. Some people look for the price tag while others are more influenced by the esthetic appeals of the packaging design. Some people might look for ethical or environmental aspects of the brand. The area of corporate social responsibility (CSR) interests many people today and is a growing concern. We found that consumers consider companies acting ethically while also new jobs among the most important responsibilities by firms today. These factors are making the purchase decision process even harder for consumers. Sweden {{is one of the most}} socially responsible countries in the world, making it important for Swedish companies to integrate CSR into the core of their businesses. One example of such integration is Fairtrade, a concept that has grown tremendously during the last decade, while the attention focused on socially responsible behavior by firms has increased. The purpose of this research is to investigate the relationship between Fairtrade and the purchase decision of consumers living in Sweden, to investigate the awareness and perception of Fairtrade and how that ultimately translates into making a purchasing decision. From this we developed the research question: “What factors influences Swedish consumers purchase decision in buying products from Fairtrade Sweden?” The target group of our research is young adults ages 18 - 30. The nature of our degree project is quantitative with a deductive approach. The research philosophy is objectivism since we do not intervene in any way as we observe the data collected from our survey. Furthermore a positivistic approach is used since we rely heavy on numbers and data rather than words. We received 158 participants in our survey. The theoretical framework consists of theories within the areas of CSR, branding, consumer attitudes-behavior and finally previous empirical studies about Fairtrade. From the theories we have developed a series of hypotheses, which we test statistically using independent-samples t-test and bivariate correlation tests. Statistical support for gender differences between men and women were found and also positive correlations between willingness to pay for Fairtrade products and how often participants purchase Fairtrade products were found. The findings from our research show that the 18 - 30 year old Swedish consumers find Fairtrade important and the general attitude towards Fairtrade is positive. Most consumers chose Fairtrade to help people and because it makes them feel good. The most common reasons why not to choice Fairtrade is because of the price or that the products simply cannot be found. Women are keener on purchasing and caring about Fairtrade products compared to men...|$|E

40|$|Mainstream {{theories}} about decision-making under risk suggest that risky {{decisions are made}} by <b>choosing</b> <b>the</b> <b>option</b> that offers <b>the</b> highest mathematical expectation. The present event-related potentials (ERPs) study investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying risky choice by contrasting a preferential choice task with an expected value choice task. The ERP data revealed that (1) the computational difficulty, which {{would be expected to}} influence a compensatory process, affected the slow wave only when participants were forced to <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> <b>option</b> with <b>the</b> highest expectation; and that (2) the difference in the minimum outcome dimension between two options, which would be expected to be influential in a heuristic process, affected the P 300 and slow wave when participants were asked to <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> preferred <b>option.</b> Our findings provide neural evidence that preferential choice is not based on an expectation computation and thus raised the question of whether expectation theories can provide an adequate description of individual risky decisions.
