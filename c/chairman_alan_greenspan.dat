25|$|Facing {{opposition}} in Congress for an initially proposed $1.6 trillion tax cut (over ten years), Bush held town hall-style public meetings {{across the nation}} in 2001 to increase public support for it. Bush {{and some of his}} economic advisers argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers. With reports of the threat of recession, Federal Reserve <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> said tax cuts could work but must be offset with spending cuts.|$|E
25|$|John Linder {{asserts that}} an {{estimated}} 11 trillion dollars is {{currently held in}} foreign accounts, largely for tax purposes, and is growing by $800 billion per year. Former Federal Reserve <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> predicts that enactment of the FairTax {{would result in a}} large portion of those funds being transferred to U.S. banks, where they would become available to U.S. capital markets, bringing down interest rates, and otherwise promoting economic growth in the United States instead of the countries where those funds are currently held.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the changed approach within the emerging economies, US policy makers and economists remained relatively unconcerned about BOP imbalances. In the early to mid-1990s, many free market economists and policy makers such as U.S. Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill and Fed <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> went on record suggesting the growing US deficit was not a major concern. While several emerging economies had intervening to boost their reserves and assist their exporters from the late 1980s, they only began running a net current account surplus after 1999. This was mirrored in the faster growth for the US current account deficit from the same year, with surpluses, deficits and the associated buildup of reserves by the surplus countries reaching record levels by the early 2000s and growing year by year. Some economists such as Kenneth Rogoff and Maurice Obstfeld began warning that the record imbalances would soon {{need to be addressed}} from as early as 2001, joined by Nouriel Roubini in 2004, {{but it was not until}} about 2007 that their concerns began to be accepted by the majority of economists.|$|E
500|$|The {{possibility}} of the euro becoming the first international reserve currency is now widely debated among economists. Former US Federal Reserve <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> gave his opinion in September 2007 that it was [...] "absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the US dollar as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency". In contrast to Greenspan's 2007 assessment, the euro's increase in {{the share of the}} worldwide currency reserve basket has slowed considerably since 2007 and {{since the beginning of the}} worldwide credit crunch related recession and European sovereign-debt crisis.|$|E
500|$|Many {{economists and}} world governments {{determined}} that the situation became the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal Reserve <b>chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan.</b> Bush, meanwhile, proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back {{a large portion of}} the U.S. mortgage market. Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said [...] "it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely", and additionally, that it would have helped [...] "for Congress to have held hearings".|$|E

500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the publication of The Fountainhead, Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom the book profoundly influenced. In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated [...] "The Collective") included future Federal Reserve <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan,</b> a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later Nathaniel Branden) and his wife Barbara, and Barbara's cousin Leonard Peikoff. At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. Later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, Atlas Shrugged, as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954 Rand's {{close relationship with the}} younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.|$|E
500|$|The {{surplus in}} fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion—the third {{consecutive}} surplus and the largest surplus ever. In 2001, Bush's budget estimated {{that there would be}} a $5.6trillion surplus over the next ten years. Facing congressional opposition, Bush held townhall style meetings across the U.S. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35trillion tax cut program—one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history. Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying [...] "the surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money." [...] Federal Reserve <b>chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security. O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts. By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant. Another tax cut program was passed that year.|$|E

On April 6, 2005, Greenspan called for a substantial increase in the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: [...] "Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee, the Fed <b>chairman,</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan,</b> said the enormous portfolios of the companies—nearly a quarter of the home-mortgage market—posed significant risks to the nation's financial system should either company face significant problems."
