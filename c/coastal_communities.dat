5|$|Although a {{powerful}} cyclone over water, {{the storm had}} relatively little impact over land. In the Valsad district, two <b>coastal</b> <b>communities</b> lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by the storm. However, the losses were more extensive offshore. Between 120 and 900 fishermen were listed as missing after contact was lost with their vessels during the storm.|$|E

5|$|Officials in Delaware and Maryland {{declared}} a state of emergency before the storm struck, and thousands of people from <b>coastal</b> <b>communities</b> evacuated to shelters. Schools closed in Delaware, and non-emergency workers were sent home. Along Long Island in New York, hundreds of thousands of people evacuated their homes, and a state of emergency was declared for several counties. In Connecticut, about 20,000 people evacuated along the coast, and 7,300 evacuated from neighboring Rhode Island. Residents also evacuated portions of Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|Over 3 million {{vessels are}} {{employed}} in sea fishing. Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to <b>coastal</b> <b>communities</b> and help alleviate poverty.|$|E
5|$|Ringed seals {{were once}} the main food staple for the Inuit. They are still an {{important}} food {{source for the}} people of Nunavut and are also hunted and eaten in Alaska. Seal meat is an important source of food for residents of small <b>coastal</b> <b>communities.</b> The seal blubber is used to make seal oil, which is marketed as a fish oil supplement.

5|$|After much delay, the new Massachusetts Constitution {{finally went}} into effect in October 1780. To no one's surprise, Hancock was elected Governor of Massachusetts in a landslide, garnering over 90% of the vote. In the absence of formal party politics, the contest was one of personality, popularity, and patriotism. Hancock was immensely popular and unquestionably {{patriotic}} given his personal sacrifices and his leadership of the Second Continental Congress. James Bowdoin, his principal opponent, was cast by Hancock's supporters as unpatriotic, citing among other things his refusal (which was due to poor health) to serve in the First Continental Congress. Bowdoin's supporters, who were principally well-off commercial interests from Massachusetts <b>coastal</b> <b>communities,</b> cast Hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to the populace.|$|E
5|$|Before Hurricane Patricia arrived, the Government of Mexico issued {{multiple}} {{watches and}} warnings for <b>coastal</b> <b>communities.</b> A hurricane watch was first raised at 09:00UTC on October21, encompassing areas of Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco. A tropical storm watch also covered portions of Guerrero. As Patricia intensified, the government issued a hurricane warning for areas between Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, and Punta San Telmo, Michoacán; {{a tropical storm}} warning supplemented this for areas farther north and east. The hurricane warning was extended northward to include areas south of San Blas, Nayarit, on October23. Once the storm moved inland {{and the threat of}} damaging winds diminished, these warnings were gradually discontinued on October24.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for the arrival of}} Marty, classes were suspended in Acapulco and the Costa Grande region. The Mexican Navy was put on standby to deal with incidents occurring within the zones of Chiapas, Guerrero, Michoacan and Jalisco. The Government of Mexico issued multiple watches and warnings for <b>coastal</b> <b>communities</b> across Guerrero; by 21:00UTC (4p.m.CDT) on September28, a tropical storm watch was in effect for west of Lázaro Cárdenas to Punta San Telmo, a tropical storm warning for Acapulco to east of Tecpán de Galeana, and a hurricane warning for Tecpán de Galeana to Lázaro Cárdenas. These were discontinued as Marty weakened and moved away from the region; all had been cancelled by early on September30.|$|E

5|$|In {{reaction}} to {{the founding of the}} MDRM, which many non-Merina feared would revive Merina political hegemony, the Party for the Disinherited of Madagascar (Parti des déshérités de Madagascar, PADESM) was formed in June 1946 by members of <b>coastal</b> <b>communities</b> formerly subjugated by the Merina empire, as well as highland-based descendents of former Merina slaves. Militant leader Mahasampo Raveloson was key {{in the creation of the}} party. Other founding members included Philibert Tsiranana (who became Madagascar's first president after independence), Albert Sylla (who became Minister of Foreign Affairs under Tsiranana, and whose son, Jacques Sylla, would go on to become Prime Minister of Madagascar under Marc Ravalomanana), and Pascale Velonjara, father-in-law of future president Didier Ratsiraka.|$|E
5|$|Islam is also practiced on the island. Islam {{was first}} brought to Madagascar in the Middle Ages by Arab and Somali Muslim traders, who {{established}} several Islamic schools {{along the eastern}} coast. While the use of Arabic script and loan words and the adoption of Islamic astrology would spread across the island, the Islamic religion failed to take hold in {{all but a handful}} of southeastern <b>coastal</b> <b>communities.</b> Today, Muslims constitute 7–3percent of the population of Madagascar and are largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of Mahajanga and Antsiranana. The vast majority of Muslims are Sunni. Muslims are divided between those of Malagasy ethnicity, Indians, Pakistanis and Comorians. More recently, Hinduism was introduced to Madagascar through Gujarati people immigrating from the Saurashtra region of India in the late 19th century. Most Hindus in Madagascar speak Gujarati or Hindi at home.|$|E
5|$|One of the Millennium Projects in the UK was the Scottish Seabird Centre, {{near the}} {{important}} bird sanctuaries on Bass Rock, Fidra {{and the surrounding}} islands. The area is home to huge colonies of gannets, puffins, skuas and other seabirds. The centre allows visitors to watch live video from the islands as well as learn about the threats the birds face {{and how we can}} protect them, and has helped to significantly raise the profile of seabird conservation in the UK. Seabird tourism can provide income for <b>coastal</b> <b>communities</b> as well as raise the profile of seabird conservation. For example, the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in New Zealand attracts 40,000 visitors a year.|$|E

5|$|Puffins {{have been}} hunted by man since time immemorial. <b>Coastal</b> <b>communities</b> and island dwellers with few natural {{resources}} at their disposal, made {{good use of}} the seafoods that they found on their cliffs and shores. Puffins were caught and eaten fresh, salted in brine or smoked and dried. Their feathers were used in bedding and their eggs were eaten, {{but not to the}} same extent as those of some other seabirds, being more difficult to extract from the nest. In most countries, Atlantic puffins are now protected by legislation, and in the countries where hunting is still permitted, strict laws prevent over-exploitation. They are still caught and eaten in Iceland and the Faroe Islands, but there have been calls for an outright ban on hunting them in Iceland because of concern over the dwindling number of birds successfully raising chicks.|$|E
5|$|Several relief {{agencies}} were already positioned {{in the region}} {{in response to a}} magnitude 6.9 earthquake in January of that year that killed over 20,000 people. Additional disaster relief teams were deployed to the region to further prepare residents for the cyclone. Food, water and other necessities were stored and ready to be provided to victims of the storm. Large swells produced by the storm affected {{a large portion of the}} western Indian coastline, especially in the city of Bombay. In the Valsad district, two <b>coastal</b> <b>communities</b> lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by the storm. Offshore, between 1,500 and 2,000 fishing vessels had lost contact with the mainland. Later reports indicated that between 120 and 900 fishermen had gone missing as a result of the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Sheet Harbour is a {{small rural}} {{community}} located on the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia, in the eastern area of the Halifax Regional Municipality. The catchment area around the community includes approximately 5,500 people. Sheet Harbour is located slightly more northward compared to other <b>coastal</b> <b>communities</b> in the area, due {{to the shape of}} the harbour. The population of Census Tract 2050154.00, which includes Sheet Harbour and a large amount of land around Sheet Harbour's land borders, is 3,478 as of the 2011 Canadian Census. Census tracts are small subdivisions of land that are used for statistics gathering by Statistics Canada that usually have a population of 2,500 to 8,000. Each census tract has a numerical designation. The population of the community of Sheet Harbour is about 800. Immediately west of Sheet Harbour is Sheet Harbour 36, a small Mi'kmaq reserve.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} tropical cyclone of the season, {{known as the}} Matagorda hurricane, developed on August23. After striking the Yucatán Peninsula, the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico and intensified into a Category3 hurricane on Saffir–Simpson scale, becoming the only major hurricane of the season. The hurricane devastated southern Texas, with damage as far inland as San Antonio. Eight fatalities and about $26.5million in damage were reported. Several of the proceeding tropical systems left little impact on land, though {{the remnants of the}} ninth tropical storm contributed to severe flooding in Virginia. In November, a hurricane caused extensive impact in several <b>coastal</b> <b>communities</b> of Belize (then known as British Honduras). The hurricane left nine deaths and about $4million in damage.|$|E
5|$|Henry Raeburn, {{most famous}} for his {{intimate}} portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, was the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. His pupils included the brothers William, Archibald and Andrew Robertson. The next generation of portrait painters included David Watson and John Watson Gordon. Significant Glasgow artists included John Graham-Gilbert and Daniel Macnee. David Wilkie emerged as {{of one of the}} most influential British artists of the century in a variety of forms. Alexander Nasmyth helped formulate the tradition of Scottish landscape painting, which focused in the mid-nineteenth century on the Highlands. It was taken into the late nineteenth century by artists including Horatio McCulloch, Joseph Farquharson and William McTaggart. Towards the end of the century a number of artist colonies were founded, particularly in <b>coastal</b> <b>communities</b> such as Pittenweem and Kirkudbright. Wilkie was instrumental in the development of genre painting, which was pursued by artists including John Burnet, Alexander George Fraser and Walter Geikie. He also helped inspire the interest in Spanish and oriental painting, continued by William Allan, David Roberts and John Phillip.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, an {{existing}} tropical storm watch was extended northward to the Merrimack River in Massachusetts. The next day, {{a tropical storm}} warning was extended northward to Plymouth, Massachusetts, but was soon replaced by a hurricane warning. The watch stretching to the Merrimack River was then replaced by a warning. By 0900 UTC on September 17, all tropical cyclone advisories were lifted. In Connecticut, utility companies readied supplies and emergency crews {{in advance of the}} hurricane. In Massachusetts and Rhode Island, with the anticipation of heavy rains, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) prepared to send eight teams into the field to take measurements along 30 rivers. Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond advised residents to prepare for the storm's onslaught. The storm disrupted many residents' travel plans in the state, while people evacuated from certain <b>coastal</b> <b>communities.</b> The threat of Hurricane Floyd forced schools, malls, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst to close.|$|E
