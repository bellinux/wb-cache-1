5|$|On 4 February 1908, Jupiter was recommissioned for reserve {{service in}} the Portsmouth Division of the new Home Fleet with a nucleus crew. She was {{flagship}} of the division from February to June 1909 and later second flagship of the 3rd Division, Home Fleet. During this service, she underwent refits at Portsmouth in 1909–1910, during which she received fire <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> for her main battery, and 1911–1912. From June 1912 to January 1913 she served as a seagoing gunnery training ship at the Nore. In January 1913 she {{was transferred to the}} 3rd Fleet, and was based at Pembroke Dock and Devonport.|$|E
5|$|The forces {{allocated}} to the defence of Singapore were not strong. In early 1945, Japanese air defences for the island included only two Army companies equipped with automatic cannon, some IJN anti-aircraft units, and {{a small number of}} fighter aircraft. Some of the anti-aircraft guns were crewed by Malay auxiliaries. The effectiveness of what was already an inadequate air defence force was hindered by a lack of coordination between the Army and Navy, shortages of fire <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> for the guns, and no fire-control radar or barrage balloons being available. Defence against night raids was particularly weak as no night fighters were stationed near Singapore and coordination between the anti-aircraft guns and searchlight units was poor.|$|E

On 11 July 1947, Wyoming put into Norfolk and was decommissioned there on 1 August. Her crew was transferred to the ex-battleship , which was also serving in the gunnery training unit. Wyoming was stricken from the Naval Vessel Registry on 16 September, and she was sold for scrapping on 30 October. She arrived on 5 December in New York, where she was dismantled by Lipsett, Incorporated.|$|E

Radio beacon is {{required}} for dynamic self-test of vessel carrier's radio measuring and <b>controlling</b> <b>equipment.</b> Also it {{is required}} to process angle-adjusting of the equipment. The paper proposes a kind of method to design beacon based on quadrature frequency-conversion technology. The parameters of the beacon can been set flexibly through MCU control.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis paper describes a digital {{automatic frequency control}} (AFC) system designed for use with almost any conventionally-tuned, high-frequency communications equipment. When connected to a high-quality equipment, such as an R- 390 receiver, frequency accuracy and stability approaching that of frequency synthesizers can be obtained. The AFC system digitally counts the frequency of all frequency-determining oscillators in the <b>controlled</b> <b>equipment,</b> computes and displays the operating frequency to the nearest Hertz. When the AFC is engaged, any deviation of the computed operating frequency from the desired frequency causes an error correction voltage to be generated. Use of this system requires that the <b>controlled</b> <b>equipment</b> be modified for voltage trimming of the tuning oscillator. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
5|$|As war approached, it {{was decided}} to retain her as a {{minelayer}} and most of the extra fire <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> was removed. She was transferred to Brest as part of the reorganization of the 5e Escadre. She sailed for Casablanca, French Morocco on 2 September with 125 Bréguet mines embarked. She was ordered to lay a defensive minefield there on 4 September, but this order was rescinded the next day, after the mines had already been fuzed, and the ship was ordered to disembark the mines. While landing the mines on 13 September one of them exploded, destroying the ship and killing 186 people. A further 73 crewmen and 47 others were injured and significant damage was caused by flying debris. One gun and some armor was salvaged during the war, but demolition work did not begin until October 1952 and was completed by July 1953.|$|E
5|$|In January 1944, workers {{laid the}} {{foundations}} for the first chemical separation building, T Plant located in 200-West. Both the T Plant and its sister facility in 200-West, the U Plant, were completed by October. (U Plant was used only for training during the Manhattan Project.) The separation building in 200-East, B Plant, was completed in February 1945. The second facility planned for 200-East was canceled. Nicknamed Queen Marys by the workers who built them, the separation buildings were awesome canyon-like structures 800 feet long, 65 feet wide, and 80 feet high containing forty process pools. The interior had an eerie quality as operators behind seven feet of concrete shielding manipulated remote <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> by looking through television monitors and periscopes from an upper gallery. Even with massive concrete lids on the process pools, precautions against radiation exposure were necessary and influenced all aspects of plant design.|$|E
5|$|Statistics on {{injuries}} {{related to}} commercial diving are normally collected by national regulators. In the UK the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) {{is responsible for}} the overview of about 5,000 commercial divers; in Norway the corresponding authority is the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (PSA), which has maintained the DSYS database since 1985, gathering statistics on over 50,000 diver-hours of commercial activity per year. The risks of dying during recreational, scientific or commercial diving are small, and for scuba diving, deaths are usually associated with poor gas management, poor buoyancy <b>control,</b> <b>equipment</b> misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error {{on the part of the}} victim. According to a North American 1972 analysis of calendar year 1970 data, diving was, based on man hours, 96 times more dangerous than driving a car. According to a 2000 Japanese study, every hour of recreational diving is 36 to 62 times riskier than driving.|$|E

40|$|Function of most {{electronic}} devices {{is based on}} the microprocessor control.

Microprocessors in a digital exchange are the typical example of that. It can be said the microprocessors are in a discrete dialogue with the controlled parts. They ascertain in regular time intervals whether the status of the <b>controlled</b> <b>equipment</b> has changed. 1 or more "busy" statuses may exist in the same time. As the changes from "free" to "busy" and from "busy" to "free" occur randomly, the state of i busy statuses lasts for a random period too.

She visited numerous East Asian ports, including Kobe, Yokohama, Nagasaki in Japan and Amoy, Shanghai, Chefoo, Nanking, and Taku in China. The ship left the Asiatic Fleet on 20 September 1906 when she departed Yokohama, bound for Honolulu. After coaling there from 3 to 8 October, she proceeded to San Francisco, arriving on 18 October. Wisconsin spent a week there before steaming north to Puget Sound, where she was decommissioned on 16 November for a lengthy overhaul that lasted until the end of April 1908. She then steamed south to San Francisco, where she arrived on 6 May {{to take part in a}} naval review there.

5|$|The United States {{remained}} neutral {{when war}} in Europe {{broke out in}} August 1914; in the Americas, political disturbances in Mexico during that country's revolution kept the US Navy occupied that year. North Dakota steamed off Veracruz, where she arrived on 26 April 1914, five days after American sailors had occupied the city. She cruised the coast of Mexico to protect Americans in the country until October, {{when she returned to}} Norfolk, Virginia, arriving on 16 October. As war loomed, the Atlantic Fleet began intensive training to prepare for a possible American entrance into the conflict. North Dakota was conducting gunnery training in Chesapeake Bay when the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917. Unlike her sister , North Dakota remained in American waters {{for the duration of the}} war, and did not see action. She was based out of York River, Virginia and New York City, and was tasked with training gunners and engine room personnel for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. Admiral Hugh Rodman requested that North Dakota remain behind because he did not trust the reliability of her engines. In 1917, her engines were replaced with new geared turbines, and new fire <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> was installed.|$|E
