Shortly after they introduced a paperless recharge system, Smart Pit, developed by NTT <b>Comware.</b> The Smart Pit system utilises a barcode printed {{on the back of}} the card allowing payments without coupons.|$|E

We instituted group learning using an interactive video conference system in the course Health Sciences Ⅲ in 2004. The video conference system is based on digital video（DV）using internet protocol（IP）technologies, and was developed by NTT <b>Comware</b> Corporation, Hokkaido. It consisted of personal computers, DV cameras, projectors, microphones and speakers. We used the video conference system in whole-group learning of Health Sciences Ⅲ for students to conduct discussions {{with each other in}} 2 classrooms and to deepen their understanding in whole-group learning. Because the quality of DV images was high, the faces of students were identified clearly. They shared slides of Microsoft Powerpoint in 2 classrooms and conducted discussions using the video conference system. Although the sound system was not appropriate in the 2 classrooms, we achieved most of the goals of the teaching program. The video conference system is thus thought to be a useful method for wholegroup learning of Health Sciences Ⅲ...|$|E
