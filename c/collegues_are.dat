40|$|There {{are several}} interpretations and {{approaches}} to relativity. All {{of them are}} characterized {{by the fact that}} none of them is accepted by physicists without doubts, even the Einsteinian General Relativity! Only those theories can get into the spotlight that predicts something that is different from predictions of other concurrent theories. From this point of view the theory of Janossy [1] is not an excellent idea, as he tried to show that his materialistic approach also corresponds to the general principles and equations of relativity. As his program was basically successful there was not any additional result, except the philosophical part. " Since the death of Janossy, his work has almost been forgotten. Both what he achieved and what he was not succeeded in. He was {{one of the founders of}} KFKI (Central Physics Research Institute of the Hungarian Scientific Academy) but his effort has not been carried over even there, however his <b>collegues</b> <b>are</b> still remember his name and his work. Luckily his books are still available in the Hungarian libraries. Additionally the most informed etherists in the world who are lucky enough to know his work are consider his work as a No 1 reference. This paper is designated to refresh the idea of the ether based gravitation theory of Janossy and introduce a well founded way to adjust it to be equivalent with the experiences and General Relativity.

40|$|Teaching {{profession}} is a strategic occupation {{in that it}} conributes to educating the adults of the future. However,depending on some stress sources related with the occupation teachers have a special risk for menthal health. Depending on literature, negative life events,loss of energy and formation of some physical discomfort is defined as?burnout sendrom?. With the belief that this group of teachers were closer {{to the risk of}} burnout because of the responsibilities they carry in relation with the needs of the special education children the aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the burnout syndrome of special education teachers in relation with their sex, age, socio-economic status, perceived support from collegues, beliefs on status of their occupation, and appreciation from their administors. The sample of this study consists of 48 special education teachers teaching at different special education institutes at Izmir. Maslach Burnout Inventory-Teacher Form and Personal Information Survey were used for gathering the data. The analysis of the data demonstrated that sex is positively related with special education teachers emotional burnout and insensitiveness level. Men have higher scores in these subdimensions. Participants from middle socio-economic status are seen to have the lowest scores in all dimensions. Participants that perceive support from <b>collegues</b> <b>are</b> seen to have significantly lower scores on emotional burnout and insensitiveness dimensions. Special education teachers who think that the status of their occupation is low in society are seen to have higher scores in emotional burnout. Beliefs about appreciation from their administors are seen to be related with burnout level of special education teachers. Participants that believed that they were not appreciated by their administrators have significantly higher scores on emotional burnout and insensitiveness subdimensions.

40|$|Processes {{take place}} at various levels within an organization. Values thus form a part of {{organizational}} culture. They are usually developed artificially, whereby employees with {{a higher level of}} education more often assume internal values and those with lower levels of education assume external values. This study focuses on establishing differences in identifying these values among managers and entrepreneurs. As part of the GLOBE project, the organizational value scale developed by Robert House and <b>collegues</b> (1997) <b>was</b> used. Fifty-nine leaders and 565 of their employees were included in the study.

40|$|John Sievenpiper {{and colleagues}} re-cently {{reported}} significantly higher blood glucose levels at 30, 45 and 60 minutes after a 900 -mL meal than after a 600 -mL or 300 -mL meal of 75 g of glu-cose. 1 Any increase in volume or decrease in osmolarity {{leading to an}} increase in the rate of gastric emptying during the first hour of the test with no effect on the result at 2 hours is intriguing. There is also evidence that blood glucose levels might be affected by the ambient temperature. In Brazil, a 75 -g load of glucose given to 1030 pregnant women resulted in a glucose concentra-tion that was 0. 2 mmol/L higher at 25 – 31 °C than at 20 – 24 °C. The corre-sponding value at 5 – 14 °C was 1. 03 mmol/L lower than at 25 – 30 °C. 2 This variable might affect test results in Canada given that ambient room tem-perature fluctuates. For the findings of Sievenpiper and <b>collegues</b> to <b>be</b> benefi-cial globally, comprehensive investiga-tions should be carried out at high and low ambient temperatures...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a chapter}} from PhD Thesis by Stefano Biagi (advisor: prof. A. Bonfiglioli). We {{overview}} existing results showing {{that it is}} possible to generalize the classical Hardy's Inequality to more general linear partial differential operators (PDOs, in the sequel), possibly degenerate-elliptic, of the following quasi-divergence form L = 1 /w(x) ∑_i = 1 ^N∂/∂ x_i(∑_j = 1 ^Nw(x) a_ij(x) ∂/∂ x_j), x ∈R^N, where w ∈ C^∞(R^N,R) is a (smooth and) strictly positive function on the whole of R^N and A(x) := is a symmetric and positive semi-definite N× N matrix with real C^∞ entries. From such a inequality, it has been derived a result of unique continuation for the solutions of the equation -L u + Vu = 0, where L is a left-invariant homogeneous PDO on a homogeneous Lie group G and V is real-valued function defined on G and continuous on G∖{ 0 }.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{organized}} into two main parts: {{the first part}} is a theoretical discussion {{on the topic of}} my choice („Translation of Non-finite Clauses in Translating from English into Croatian“); the second part is made up of five translations given by teachers, some are written in the English language which we translated into Croatian, and some in Croatian which we translated into English. Each translation is from a different text and covers a different topic. My translations include just a few pages of every text, and my <b>collegues</b> <b>were</b> given other parts of the same five texts, so that together our translations make a complete translation. Because of that, it was necessary {{for all of us to}} cooperate in order to unify the terminology and style of the translations. The texts we translated are books and one is a collection of Wikipedia articles. The first text is a self-help book by Ljubica Uvodić-Vranić called Avantura osobne promjene: Priručnik za odrasle koji žele još rasti (our translation: The Adventure of Personal Change 1 : A Manual for Grown-ups who Want to Continue Growing) which covers many themes such as interpersonal relationships, outlook on life, romantic advice etc. The second book is a literary theory book in the English language about children's literature by Carrie Hintz and Eric L. Tribunella called Reading Children's Literature: A Critical Introduction (our translation: Čitanje dječje književnosti: Kritički uvod) in which the authors explain types of children’s literature and various approaches of analysing it. The third text is a collection of Wikipedia articles in Croatian on the topic of art history. The fourth is a book in English by Madeleine Bunting called Willing Slaves: How the overwork culture is ruling our lives (our translation: Dobrovoljni robovi: kako kultura prekomjernog rada upravlja našim životima) and deals with the topic of overwork in the UK and how it affects people’s lives. The fifth book in the English language and is written by Louis Heyse-Moore, called Speaking of Dying. A Practical Guide to Using Counselling Skills in Palliative Care (our translation: Kako razgovarati o smrti), a handbook about palliative care aimed at carers of the terminally ill or dying patients. In endnotes I explained why I chose to translate a word or part of the text the way I did.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{instrument}} to measure the school administrators' assessment scale of teacher performance. First, organizational psychological research on performance appraisal and the factors that affect the rating was reviewed. Next, organizational research on the school administrators' assessment scale of teacher performance was reviewed. It was noted that performance appraisal must be accurate because it is used the decisions about promotion, salary, assignments, and education. After problems were described, a new version of the school administrators' assessment scale of teacher performance was developed. In the Study 1, an inventory of the principals' assessment scale of teacher performance was conducted by 98 primary school principals. Factor Analysisof scale of the principals' assessment resulted in 6 factors (Treatment of school business, Classroom management and Pupils' Guidance, Educational guidance, INterpersonal skills with children, School-based training of teachers, Educational guidance, Organizational activity). In the Study 2, an inventory of the assistant principals' assessment scale of teacher performance was conducted by 104 primary school assistant principals. Factor analysis of scales of the assistant principals' assessment resulted in 5 factors (Interpersonal skills with children, Organizational activity, Classroom management and Pupils' Guidance, School-based training of teachers, Intersonal skills with parents and <b>collegue).</b> Results <b>were</b> discussed from multi-dimentional assessment scales of teacher performance including of contextual performance...|$|R
40|$|CDATA[Background: Body weight plays a main {{role for}} the Indian {{adolescent}} college students for their physical look. Body mass index reflects health status of individual. Body mass index is associated with self esteem of students. Methodology: A cross section study was conducted on 96 students of 17 - 19 years of age group. Nutritional status of participants was assessed by Omron HBF- 362 body fat analyzer. The body weight, body mass index, resting metabolism, metabolic age, body fat percentage and visceral fat were assessed by this instrument. Dietary questionnaire {{was taken from the}} students. Results: Body mass index (P < 0. 01), resting metabolism (P < 0. 0001) and visceral fat (P < 0. 0001) of Indian adolescent girls were found to be significantly lower than their <b>collegue</b> boys. Girls <b>are</b> not satisfied with their body image and Indian adolescent girls are skipping their meal rather than doing physical exercise. Conclusion: We may conclude that nutritional status and awareness about nutrition play a main role for individual’s body image. ]]...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study within econophysics, a {{research}} field where financial problems are investigated using methods from statistical physics. An artificial stock market was implemented in Java and used to assess some assertions made in empirical studies by J. -P. Bouchaud and <b>collegues.</b> The model <b>was</b> able to reproduce several characteristics of high-fequency data from financial markets, e. g. a leptocurtic return distribution and a nearly constant return function. Much of the emphasis of this report is made on the methodol-ogy itself, since many modelling issues remain to be solved in the agent-based computational economics field. However, the market was also used to simlulate trading scenarios, where the impact of different trading strategies was analysed. More specifically, it was shown in simulation that an overall diffusive price development can result from a competition between two populations of traders: one of liquidity providers, who create persistence in the prices, and another of liquidity takers, who create anti-persistence. It was also shown that a slowly decaying trade sign autocorrelation function could result from similar trading criteria, but not in any obvious way from liquidity provider’s division of large market orders into several smaller ones...|$|R
40|$|The {{conference was}} {{stimulating}} {{and a wonderful}} opportunity for international networking with colleagues from Canada, the United States and around the world. In particular I connected with a <b>collegue</b> who <b>is</b> an ethnoecologist from Hungary, with whom I had previously corresponded, and a colleague from the US whose work I have previously cited. I spoke with {{the editor of the}} Ethnobiology textbook I have a co-authored chapter in while at the meeting. My new books were very well received and I was able to sell several copies for the publishers at the book sale. I also shared accommodations with my recent MAIS student Sheila Grieves, and spent time meeting with a graduate student from the University of Washington. I received very positive comments on the paper I presented, and one colleague asked if I had a copy available to share. I intend to work up the paper and submit it to the Journal of Ethnobiology for publication. The discussions were good in our session, and I made the acquaintance of colleagues from India and New Zealand who are also working on ethno-ornithology. Birds are salient actors in human environments around the world, and are carriers of meaning, their actions invested with a range of significance. This paper will present thoughts on the significance of birds in several cultures in Northwest North America based on long term research with Gitksan, Witsuwit’en, Kaska and Gwich’in. The observations I share were made by spending time on the land with people and in conversation —that is in everyday circumstances and through commonly repeated traditional stories. Accordingly what I present is a series of examples of certain salient birds and their meanings across the range of localities where I’ve worked. As such they are common birds, frequently observed. Relationships with these birds include: commensalism and sharing; power; birds as food; symbolic and metaphoric associations; and ecological relationships. Birds often appear as art motifs, and have strong roles in traditional narratives. Birds also enrich human experience...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I collected {{some of my}} {{works in}} connection with veterinary spatial, spatiotemporal epidemiology. With our <b>collegues</b> we have <b>been</b> working on the epidemiology of rabies of red foxes in Hungary. From this work one paper was published until now, {{in which we have}} analysed the temporal patterns of disease occurence. In spatial epidemiology of rabies we had a few conference presentations, from these some interesting results are included in this dissertation. We had some interesting experiences using Moran’s I method in analyses of spatial clustering of rabies cases. These prompted us to deal with the null distribution of the test statistic. In spatial epidemiology the usage of the Bayesian methods is increasing. In rabies epidemiology we used Bayesian models as well. To make easier the spatial Bayesian modelling I am developing a tool for preparation of data and maps to help the user of GeoBUGS. At the end of the nineties by dIstván Medveczky I was invited into the analysis of the results of countrywide Aujeszky’s disease eradication program. At county level we published an evironmental association paper from this disease. Since 2007 I have been working on studying the possible associations of animal health and climate change. In this work we are working on the heat stress modelling of cattle based on observed meteorological data and climate scenarios. Based on climate and other environmental (e. g. landcover) datasets researchers can model environmental associations and/or predict spatial distribution of diseases. Due to climate change expectedly new vectorborne diseases may appear in temperate zone. For modelling the spatial pattern changes in disease distributions due to global changes we are studying the environmental similarity of different sites of Earth. In this work we try to find sites on the Globe where the climate in the past is close to the future climate in Hungary. Identifying similar areas we could predict for which pathogens will be suitable the climate of Hungary. For this modelling we need climate datasets. Some of that kind of datasets are available, but sometimes {{it is very difficult to}} use them. As a first step of this work I have developed a tool to make easier the usage of one of climate datasets (Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research produced one) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{contributes}} {{to our understanding}} of differences in work motivation between executives in the military, public and private sectors in Norway. I have found scattered empirical studies that deals with leadership and leaderbehaviour in the Norwegian Defence, and especially studies that compare military leadership and leadership in the civilian society. As far as I know there are no empirical coparisons between military and civilian leadership in Norway. The problem I have addressed in this masterstudy is: To what extent are executives in the Norwegian Defence more motivated by intrinsic factors compared to executives in civilian (public and private) sectors? My theoretical basis for the study are the sociological theories of Samuel P. Huntington and Morris Janowitz regarding military officers and the military profession. Huntington speaks of three essential elements in military profesionalism: expertise, responsibility and corporateness (Huntington, 1985). Janowitz (1971), on the other hand, argues among other things that there are increased integration between the military and the society. This lead to officers with more equal attitudes and values like we can see in the society. I have had data from a survey of 2181 private sector and 790 public sector executives in Norway. This data is regarded as representative for all leaders in Norway (Colbjørnsen, 2004). In addition, I have performed a similar survey among executives in the Norwegian Defence which include 1018 military and 179 civilian respondents. I can summarize my findings in the following five mainpoints: 1. It is surprisingly minor differences what executives place emphasis on between military and civilian sector. I find few traces of a peculiar “military culture” in my findings. 2. Topexecutives place more emphasis on intrinsic motivation than middle managers in all sectors. The Topexecutive officers put similliar emphasis than other public topexecutives on the oppurtunity to make “contributions to important decisions” that can “benefit the society”. The Topexecutives in private sector place more emphasis on the personal benefits, and less on contributions that can “benefit the society”. 3. Officers who are middlemanagers put foremost emphasis on the possibility to combine the work with their personal life, have professional challeging collegues, attractive place of work, large freedom to decide themselves how to work, and a superior who can encourage, inspire and support. Jo Inge H. Aambakk Side 4 av 85 Masteroppgave 4. Military executives are different from executives in civilian sector in the importance of emphasis on collegues both professional and in a friendly spirit. The strong “espirit de corps” with close social ties to their <b>collegues</b> seems to <b>be</b> values which are institutional among executives in the Norwegian Defence. 5. Intrinsic motivation might reduse turnover. Initiative which can contribute to strengthen the intrinsic motivation can have positive impact for the organizations, and make them more competitive in keeping their employees...|$|R
