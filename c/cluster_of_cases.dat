Data was analyzed to determine if similar <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> IDDM occurred after immunization with the hepatitis B vaccine. Methods: Data on the inci-dence of IDDM from hepatitis B immunized and unimmunized cohorts of children was analyzed {{for the presence of}} clus-ters occurring after hepatitis B immunization. Results: Data from Italy, France, and New Zealand indicated rises in the in-cidence of IDDM occurred between 24 to 48 months after the introduction of the hepatitis B immunization in young chil-dren. Conclusion: Several different vaccines as well as infections with natural mumps virus are followed by <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> IDDM that occur about 24 to 48 months after immunization. This suggests a similar mechanism of action, possi-bly the triggering of a progressive autoimmune phenomenon...|$|R

2500|$|In the United States, initial {{reports of}} {{atypical}} flu in two individuals in southern California {{led to the}} discovery of the virus by the Center for Disease Control in mid-April. More than a hundred cases were confirmed in the following two weeks, across a dozen states. Outside of California and Texas, initial cases were all tied to recent travel to Mexico or close contact with those who had. St. Francis Preparatory School, a private school in New York, was the center of a large <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> after a spring break trip by several students. It {{was one of the first}} US schools to be closed during the early outbreak. Most of the cases in California and Texas were not linked and may have reflected localized outbreaks. The disease was not as virulent outside of Mexico, for reasons not fully understood. The US declared a state of Public Health Emergency, but this was said to be standard procedure in cases as divergent as the recent inauguration and flooding. On 29 April, the US suffered its first confirmed death, and on 5 May the first US citizen died from swine flu. As of 6 June, there were 17 confirmed deaths from swine flu in the US. As of mid-May 2009 many states had abandoned testing unless serious illness and/or hospitalization were present. Because reported numbers represented only confirmed cases, they were a [...] "very great understatement" [...] of the total number of cases of infection, according to the CDC. The real number of cases in the United States could be 「upwards of 100,000,」 a top public health official estimated on Friday – far higher than the official count of 7,415 cases confirmed by laboratories.|$|E

40|$|Background In case control studies {{disease risk}} not {{explained}} by the significant risk factors is the unex-plained risk. Considering unexplained risk for specific populations, places and times can re-veal the signature of unidentified risk factors and risk factors not fully accounted for in the case-control study.

Methods Global, local and focused Q-statistics are applied to data from a population-based case-control study of 11 southeast Michigan counties. Analyses were conducted using both year-and age-based measures of time. The analyses were adjusted for arsenic exposure, educa-tion, smoking, family history of bladder cancer, occupational exposure to bladder cancer carcinogens, age, gender, and race.
