5|$|The {{piezoelectric}} {{properties of}} crystalline quartz were discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. The first quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> {{was built by}} Walter G. Cady in 1921, and in 1927 the first quartz clock was built by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Canada. The following decades saw the development of quartz clocks as precision time measurement devices in laboratory settingsâ€”the bulky and delicate counting electronics, built with vacuum tubes, limited their practical use elsewhere. In 1932, a quartz clock able to measure small weekly variations in the rotation rate of the Earth was developed. The National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the time standard of the United States on quartz clocks from late 1929 until the 1960s, when it changed to atomic clocks. In 1969, Seiko produced the world's first quartz wristwatch, the Astron. Their inherent accuracy and low cost of production {{has resulted in the}} subsequent proliferation of quartz clocks and watches.|$|E

25|$|Some {{types of}} quartz {{crystals}} have piezoelectric properties; they develop an electric potential upon {{the application of}} mechanical stress. An early use of this property of quartz crystals was in phonograph pickups. One {{of the most common}} piezoelectric uses of quartz today is as a <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator.</b> The quartz clock is a familiar device using the mineral. The resonant frequency of a quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> is changed by mechanically loading it, and this principle is used for very accurate measurements of very small mass changes in the quartz crystal microbalance and in thin-film thickness monitors.|$|E

25|$|A <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> is an {{electronic}} circuit {{that uses the}} mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a very precise frequency. This frequency is commonly used {{to keep track of}} time as used in quartz wristwatches, to provide a stable clock signal for digital integrated circuits, and to stabilize frequencies for radio transmitters and receivers. The first crystal-controlled oscillator, using a crystal of Rochelle Salt, was invented by Alexander M. Nicholson. However, it is generally accepted that Dr. Walter Guyton Cady was the first to use a quartz to control the frequency of an oscillator circuit. Nevertheless, Nicholson is still regarded as the inventor of the <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Radio Science Experiment (REX) used an ultrastable <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> (essentially a {{calibrated}} crystal in {{a miniature}} oven) and some additional electronics to conduct radio science investigations using the communications channels. These are {{small enough to}} fit on a single card. Because there are two redundant communications subsystems, there are two, identical REX circuit boards.|$|E
25|$|Coherent {{techniques}} generate frequencies {{derived from}} a single, stable master oscillator. In most applications, a <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> is common, but other resonators and frequency sources can be used. Incoherent techniques derive frequencies from a set of several stable oscillators. The vast majority of synthesizers in commercial applications use coherent techniques due to simplicity and low cost.|$|E

25|$|These {{are used}} as voltage-controlled capacitors. These are {{important}} in PLL (phase-locked loop) and FLL (frequency-locked loop) circuits, allowing tuning circuits, {{such as those in}} television receivers, to lock quickly on to the frequency. They also enabled tunable oscillators in early discrete tuning of radios, where a cheap and stable, but fixed-frequency, <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> provided the reference frequency for a voltage-controlled oscillator.|$|E
25|$|Quartz clocks {{employ a}} <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> {{made from a}} quartz crystal that uses a {{combination}} of both direct and converse piezoelectricity to generate a regularly timed series of electrical pulses that is used to mark time. The quartz crystal (like any elastic material) has a precisely defined natural frequency (caused by its shape and size) at which it prefers to oscillate, and this is used to stabilize the frequency of a periodic voltage applied to the crystal.|$|E
25|$|Modifications to each {{operating}} {{radar station}} {{occurred during the}} construction phase of the DEW Line system. This {{was due to the}} extreme winds, frigid temperatures, and the ground conditions due to permafrost and ice. There were two significant electronic modifications that were also crucial to the functioning of these radar stations in an arctic environment. One reduced the effects of vibration in correlation to temperature change, the other increased the pulse duration from two to six microseconds. It also began using a <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> for more stable readings and accurate accounts of movement within the air.|$|E
40|$|At {{the present}} time, {{there is a}} need by the {{military}} for small, low-power, fast-warmup, and low g-sensitivity <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillators</b> for use in GPS receivers and transmitters in handheld survival radios and smart munitions. These units require a stable frequency source (<b>crystal</b> <b>oscillators</b> or small rubidium atomic clocks) for their operation. A variety of <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillators</b> are now on the market, and {{there is a need}} to evaluate the latest technology so that performance can be compared and evaluated. Insight into the characteristics of the various classes of <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillators</b> used by the contractors enables The Aerospace Corporation to identify the performance risks early in program development, which helps avoid schedule delays and later cost impacts. This paper describes a modernized clock-oscillator measurement facility that has been established at Aerospace to characterize these frequency sources in support of the military programs.

25|$|A {{phase locked}} loop is a {{feedback}} control system. It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an error signal that {{is proportional to the}} difference between their phases. The error signal is then low pass filtered and used to drive a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a frequency divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output frequency drifts, the phase error signal will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator,</b> which is very stable in frequency. The block diagram below shows the basic elements and arrangement of a PLL based frequency synthesizer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{solution}} to this was the development of circuits which could generate multiple frequencies from a [...] "reference frequency" [...] produced by a <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator.</b> This is called a frequency synthesizer.

2500|$|The {{timekeeping}} {{accuracy of}} the pendulum was exceeded by the quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator,</b> invented in 1921, and quartz clocks, invented in 1927, replaced pendulum clocks as the world's best timekeepers. [...] Pendulum clocks were used as time standards until World War 2, although the French Time Service continued using them in their official time standard ensemble until 1954. [...] Pendulum gravimeters were superseded by [...] "free fall" [...] gravimeters in the 1950s, but pendulum instruments continued to be used into the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|Gulf gravimeter: One of {{the last}} and most {{accurate}} pendulum gravimeters was the apparatus developed in 1929 by the Gulf Research and Development Co. [...] It used two pendulums made of fused quartz, each [...] in length with a period of 0.89 second, swinging on pyrex knife edge pivots, 180Â° out of phase. They were mounted in a permanently sealed temperature and humidity controlled vacuum chamber. Stray electrostatic charges on the quartz pendulums had to be discharged by exposing them to a radioactive salt before use. The period was detected by reflecting a light beam from a mirror {{at the top of}} the pendulum, recorded by a chart recorder and compared to a precision <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> calibrated against the WWV radio time signal.
