40|$|In {{order to}} assess the quality of soil from natural and/or anthropogenically {{affected}} sites, {{there is a need}} for ecologically based characteristics. In the reported project this aim was attempted internationally. Under methodical co-ordination from Germany, research groups from Russia (D. G. Zvyagintsev, M. M. Umarov), Slovakia (P. Bielek), <b>Czech</b> <b>Republik</b> (M. Tesarova, J. Kubat) and Hungary (T. Szili-Kovacs, A. Anton) used a number of biological methods to establish their capacity in differentiating (a) the community of soil organisms, (b) mineralization activity, and (c) synthesizing activity in undisturbed and anthropogenically affected soils. In two years, sampling was made repeatedly from 43 soil sites. The results indicate the microbial biomass and population densities (colony counts) of oligotrophic and N_ 2 fixing bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi as suitable characteristics of the microbial community. For the assessment of mineralization activity, soil respiration, nitrification and the dehydrogenase activity appear valuable measures. The estimation of the balance of humic substances serves as an ecologically valuable measure of synthesizing activities in soil. (orig.)
