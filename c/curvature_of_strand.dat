40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{relations}} between network structure and rheological properties of soy protein gels {{as a function of}} pH and ionic strength. Network structure has been characterized independently by permeability measurements and confocal scanning laser microscopy in terms of coarseness. Results showed that gels at pH 3. 8 and 5. 2 were coarser than at pH 7. 6, except for pH 3. 8 – 0 M NaCl. Rheological properties determined were dynamic moduli, Young's modulus, fracture stress and fracture strain. Gels at pH 3. 8 had lower fracture strains and higher moduli than gels at pH 5. 2 and 7. 6, while fracture stresses were about the same. To relate the rheological properties to network structure in a self-consistent way, an additional structural parameter was required: <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>strands...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{the paper}} is to propose a new {{approach}} for {{the determination of the}} so termed self-damping, or internal damping, of metallic cables. The formulation is developed starting from a recent mechanical model <b>of</b> a <b>strand,</b> from which the hysteretic bending behavior <b>of</b> <b>stranded</b> cables is derived. Each wire of the cable is individually modeled as an elastic curved thin rod. A kinematic model is defined to relate the axial strain and bending <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>strand</b> to the generalized strains of the wire. The interaction among the wires belonging to adjacent layers is then studied by neglecting deformations of the contact surfaces and assuming a classic Amontons–Coulomb friction law. In the adopted strand mechanical model a function is derived, which defines the domain of admissible values of the wire axial force to prevent sliding. A simplified model of the cable hysteretic bending behavior is then derived from the cyclic response predicted with the adopted mechanical formulation <b>of</b> the <b>strand,</b> leading to a closed-form upper-bound estimate of the energy dissipated when the cable cross section is subjected to alternate bending. This expression is used as the starting block for the definition of an analytical equation giving an upper-bound estimate of the cable self-damping. The predictions of the proposed model are compared to available data resulting from experiments and empirical literature equations: the comparison is extended to a wide range <b>of</b> <b>strands</b> and parameters that characterize practically most of the configuration commonly used in overhead electrical lines...|$|R

40|$|A {{sculpture}} and the mould {{in which it}} was formed are typical examples of objects with an identical, but opponent, surface shape: each convex (ie outward pointing) surface part of a sculpture has a concave counterpart in the mould. The question arises whether the object features of opponent shapes can be compared by touch. Therefore, we investigated whether human observers were able to discriminate the <b>curvatures</b> <b>of</b> convex and concave shapes, irrespective of whether the shape was convex or concave. Using a 2 AFC procedure, subjects had to compare the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> a convex shape to the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> a concave shape. In addition, results were also obtained for congruent shapes, when the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> either only convex shapes or only concave shapes had to be compared. Psychometric curves were fitted to the data to obtain threshold and bias results. When subjects explored the stimuli with a single index finger, significantly higher thresholds were obtained for the opponent shapes than for the congruent shapes. However, when the stimuli were touched by two index fingers, one finger per surface, we found similar thresholds. Systematic biases were found when the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> opponent shapes was compared: the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> a more curved convex surface was judged equal to the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> a less curved concave surface. We conclude that human observers had the ability to compare the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> shapes with an opposite direction, but that their performance decreased when they sensed the opponent surfaces with the same finger. Moreover, they systematically underestimated the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> convex shapes compared to the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> concave shapes...|$|R
