50|$|Alone on the Kreuzberg 20 cannons {{were put}} up {{directing}} towards the approaching French Armée de Berlin under Oudinot. However, with the Allied Northern Army under Crown Prince Charles XIV John of Sweden defeating the French {{already in the}} Battle of Großbeeren on August 23, the sconce was never used for defence and was later called Lärmkanonenschanze (<b>noise</b> <b>cannon</b> sconce). Already in September 1813 the sloppily constructed huts of the citadel collapsed.|$|R
5000|$|A {{complaint}} was {{filed against the}} club due to the <b>noise</b> of the <b>cannon</b> firing. [...] The New York City Environmental Control Board ruled that {{the sound of the}} <b>cannon</b> violated city <b>noise</b> ordinances. The club argued that the firing of the cannon was a patriotic expression and thus constitutionally protected free speech. In 2007, an appellate court ruled that the noise levels produced did indeed violate the Administrative Code of City of NY, but that the club could still fire the canon, but only at reduced sound levels.|$|R
50|$|In late 2007 {{the band}} {{embarked}} on headlining {{tours of the}} United Kingdom, Japan, Europe and the United States. During this tour, Phil Petrocelli of Seattle band, Black <b>Noise</b> <b>Cannon,</b> took over as the band's touring drummer. Jesu released their second split release, this time with Japanese post-rock band, Envy, exclusively in Japan through Daymare Records on 11 July 2008. On 12 August 2008, a third split 12", this time with Battle of Mice, was engineered by Joel Hamilton and released by Robotic Empire. The album had originally been announced in 2006 but was delayed while awaiting cover art.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1820s the Geri(c)ke {{brothers}} bought the triangular {{site on the}} eastern slope of Kreuzberg, an exploited sand pit, between the former road to Teltow, the Halle highway and Colonnenweg (today's Dudenstraße) preparing a colony of villas there, later called Wilhelmshöhe. In 1829 the Gericke brothers further opened the amusement park named Tivoli, after the Parisian example, {{on the site of}} the levelled <b>noise</b> <b>cannon</b> sconce on the southern slope of the Kreuzberg, offering among others the so-called Russische Rutschbahn, a circular roller coaster running over hill and dale. By 1834 a new sand pit had opened further west at the site of today's waterfall in the Victoria Park.|$|R
6000|$|The Highlanders of {{an early}} period were afraid of <b>cannon,</b> with the <b>noise</b> and effect of which they were totally unacquainted. It was by means {{of three or four}} small pieces of {{artillery}} that the Earls of Huntly and Errol, in James VI's time, gained a great victory at Glenlivat, over a numerous Highland army, commanded by the Earl of Argyle. At the battle of the Bridge of Dee, General Middleton obtained by his artillery a similar success, the Highlanders not being able to stand the discharge of Musket's Mother, which was the name they bestowed on great guns. In an old ballad on the battle of the Bridge of Dee these verses occur:-- ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} an hour I {{went back}} to the Refreshment-room, within the outer gate of the Tower, where the rest of us shortly appeared. We now {{returned}} westward by way of Great Tower Street, Eastcheap, and Cannon Street, and, entering St. Paul's, sat down beneath the misty dome to rest ourselves. The muffled roar of the city, as we heard it there, is very soothing, and keeps one listening to it, somewhat as the flow of a river keeps us looking at it. It is a grand and quiet sound; and, ever and anon, a distant door slammed somewhere in the cathedral, and reverberated long and heavily, like the roll of thunder or the boom of <b>cannon.</b> Every <b>noise</b> that is loud enough to be heard in so vast an edifice melts into the great quietude. The interior looked very sombre, and the dome hung over us like a cloudy sky. I wish it were possible to pass directly from St. Paul's into York Minster, or from the latter into the former; that is, if one's mind could manage to stagger under both in the same day. There is no other way of judging of their comparative effect.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} also freely {{available}} online at: [URL] paper {{presents the results}} of the theoretical calculations of sound radiation from tunnel portals by air shock waves generated by high-speed trains travelling in underground tunnels. This phenomenon, also known as 'tunnel boom', is associated with very loud and sharp noise, similar to that of <b>cannon</b> shots. This <b>noise</b> may be very disturbing for local residents and wildlife. A simple analytical model has been developed to calculate the generated sound. The model takes into account the ground effect outside the tunnel and uses Rayleigh integral to calculate the sound pressure. The model can predict the acoustic frequency spectra and the waveforms generated at arbitrary distances and directions outside the exit tunnel portal. Numerical results have been produced for several selected tunnels in the UK located along the planned high speed railway route HS 2 and identified as being capable of generating tunnel boom. Potential implications of these results are discussed, as well as possible mitigation measures...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{following}} issue we see Victor as Cyborg. As the issue opens Victor cannot feel his hands or legs. He sees {{himself for the}} first time with his robotic parts and is panicked by his new body. Suddenly, Parademons burst into the red room and leap toward Sarah Charles. However, Cyborg's defense system's reacts automatically weaponizing his arm into a sound cannon from which he fires his powerful white <b>noise</b> <b>cannon,</b> disintegrating the two Parademons and blasting a gigantic hole in the Star Labs building. After saving Sarah's life Victor asks his father what has happened to him, his father tells him that he couldn't let him die. Cyborg obviously distraught exclaims, [...] "You did this to me." [...] and flees, despite Silas' plea for him to wait. Later in the street Cyborg sees a woman being set upon by a group of Parademons. He leaps to the woman's aid, punching the parademon. However, in ensuing scuffle Cyborg inadvertently absorbs some of the Parademon's components giving him access to Boom Tube technology. This new ability automatically transports or teleports Victor to where Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Green Lantern, and Aquaman are fighting the Parademons, moments before Darkseid arrives. Cyborg fights alongside the other heroes against Darkseid and his Parademons, but despite their best efforts Darkseid proves to be too strong. Fortunately, Cyborg is able to reverse engineer the alien boom tube technology and with a considerable amount of stress on his systems he is able to teleport all the invading aliens including Darkseid off the planet, saving the Earth. After sending Darkseid back where he came from, Cyborg helps to found the Justice League.|$|R
