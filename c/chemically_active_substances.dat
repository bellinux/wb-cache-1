50|$|Commissioned around 1766 by the {{pharmacist}} Franz Huber Hoefer for the apothecary's shop of the Grand Duke of Florence, this large table of chemical substances {{was designed to}} guide the preparer of pharmaceutical remedies in identifying the compounds most likely to combine with one another. The table is modeled on Étienne-François Geoffroy's Table des differents Rapports observés entre differentes substances (Paris, 1718), from which it differs by adding a seventeenth column. The substances are identified by traditional alchemical symbols and the symbolic language in use in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. The Florentine table does not, however, include the symbol of air. This means that it was compiled in a period when there was not yet a full awareness of the function of air as a <b>chemically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substance,</b> hence capable of combining with solids and liquids.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Coupling {{agents are}} used in wood plastic {{composites}} to improve interfacial adhesion between natural fibers and polymers. However, improvement in interfacial adhesion leads to increased melt viscosity, thereby affecting the processing rate. To overcome this limitation, viscosity modifiers are added. Since interface modifiers and viscosity modifiers are <b>chemically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances,</b> {{there is a high}} possibility of interactions between them. To investigate this point, the effect of interactions between viscosity modifiers and an interface modifier on melt flow viscosity and mechanical properties of the composite were analyzed. The results showed that the acrylated maleated polyethylene based interface modifier interacts synergistically with the partially halogenated viscosity modifier, whereas its interaction is antagonistic with the carboxylic acid amide based viscosity modifier.

40|$|The {{development}} of novel electrochemical sensors and solid phase on-line derivatisation devices using conducting polymeric materials {{has been investigated}} in this work. Polypyrrole was the material of choice due to its merits over other conducting polymers, particularly the ease of synthesis {{and the ability to}} incorporate a wide range of counterions. Polypyrroles containing a range of <b>chemically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> have been electrochemically synthesised and their properties characterised using various techniques. Incorporation of the desired substances was verified using elemental analysis, amino acid analysis, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FABMS) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The electroactivity and conductivity of these polymers were evaluated using chronopotentiometry, cyclic voltammetry and cyclic resistometry. The electrochemical release of counterions, such as anthraquinone- 2, 6 -sulphonic acid (AQSA), dichromate, human serum albumin (HSA) and pyridine- 2, 6 -dicarboxylic acid (PDCA), from polypyrrole polymers has been investigated. It was found that the rate of release of the counterion {{is a function of the}} counterion size, charge and hydrophobicity. The applied potential and the solution conditions (ionic strength, pH, supporting electrolyte and solvent) also affected the rate of release. Polypyrrole was coated onto platinum and thin mercury film electrodes, and the capability of preconcentrating metal ions by complexation and/or precipitation using these electrodes have been investigated. Experimental results demonstrated that polypyrrole modified electrodes were able to chemically preconcentrate silver ions and subsequently generate voltammetric signals. Polypyrrole modified electrodes were also found to enhance selectivity for the detection of dichloramine over other chloramine species. Polypyrroles containing diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC) and aryl sulfatase (AS) have been investigated for use as polymeric reagents in a reactor for on-line derivatisation. The DTC ligands were electrochemically released from the polymer into the eluent to form copper-DTC and nickel-DTC complexes for subsequent detection. Polymer immobilised AS catalysed the derivatisation of p-nitrocatecholsulfate (PNCS) to p-nitrocatechol which enhanced the sensitivity of PNCS detection. This study has indicated that it is possible for polypyrroles containing <b>chemically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> to be used as electrochemical sensors and solid phase on-line derivatisation devices...|$|E

40|$|Self-organizing {{patterns}} {{arise in}} a variety of ways in nature, the complex patterning observed on animal coats is such an example. It is already known that the mechanisms responsible for pattern formation starts at the developmental stage of an embryo. However, the actual process determining cell fate has been, and still is, unknown. The mathematical interest for pattern formation emerged from the theories formulated by the mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing in 1952. He attempted to explain the mechanisms behind morphogenesis and how the process of spatial cell differentiation from homogeneous cells lead to organisms with different complexities and shapes. Turing formulated a mathematical theory and proposed a reaction-diffusion system where morphogens, a postulated <b>chemically</b> <b>active</b> <b>substance,</b> moderated the whole mechanism. He concluded that this process was stable as long as diffusion was neglected; otherwise this would lead to a diffusion-driven instability, which is the fundamental part of pattern formation. The mathematical theory describing this process consists of solving partial differential equations and Turing considered deterministic reaction-diffusion systems.   This thesis will start with introducing the reader to the problem and then gradually build up the mathematical theory needed to get an understanding of the stochastic reaction-diffusion systems that is the focus of the thesis. This study will to a large extent simulate stochastic systems using numerical computations and in order to be computationally feasible a compartment-based model will be used. Noise is an inherent part of such systems, so the study will also discuss the effects of noise and morphogen kinetics on different geometries with boundaries of different complexities from one-dimensional cases up to three-dimensions...|$|R
30|$|Chemical PPPs {{are used}} {{because of their}} {{biological}} efficacy in key areas: bactericides and fungicides are used to combat plant diseases caused by bacteria and fungi; insecticides kill insects such as aphids or caterpillars that damage plants; and herbicides are used to control “weeds”. To achieve these effects, the PPPs—which can consist of mixtures of up to 20 different chemicals—typically contain one or more <b>chemically</b> synthesised <b>active</b> <b>substance.</b> However, their effects are not usually very specific, i.e., not restricted to the target organisms in question. The description of the potential side effects is, therefore, {{an important element of}} the testing and approval procedure for PPPs. The direct effects of a PPP are described mainly on the basis of laboratory experiments in which indicator organisms such as algae, water fleas, fish, earthworms, bees, birds, and rats are exposed to the <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> or the PPP. These studies are used to determine the acute and/or chronic toxicity of PPPs for the so-called “non-target organisms”. Generally speaking, all PPPs can be expected to have more or less severe side effects—if the non-target organisms are exposed to relevant quantities. In other words: No effect (plant protection) without side effects (on organisms in the environment). The side effect profile of the PPP usually corresponds to the intended pesticidal effect: herbicides are particularly toxic for algae and non-target plants that are phylogenetic and biochemical relatives of “weeds”; similarly, insecticides are often just as toxic for beneficial insect species (honey bees, wild bees, butterflies, etc.) and other arthropods (spiders, woodlice, etc.) as they are for pest insects. With regard to bactericides and fungicides, the profile of the side effects is usually less clear. At the level of natural biocoenoses and ecosystems, it is known that direct PPP effects on certain organisms can lead in turn to indirect PPP effects on other organisms that are not directly affected by the toxicity (see further below).|$|R

In Australia, essential oils are classified and regulated under the same policies as conventional medicines such as the National Medicines Policy and the Quality Use of Medicines (QUM) framework applies.

Clients are placed at the centre of a QUM medication management process, which is consistent with holistic care. Applying a QUM approach to essential oil use, Quality Use of Essential Oils (QUEO), involves developing effective systems for managing essential oils from an holistic perspective that includes structured assessment and diagnostic processes to enable effective essential oil prescribing and outcome monitoring. In a QUEO approach, essential oils are integrated into the client 2 ̆ 7 s overall medication regimen and care plan rather than being used as ‘add-ons’.

50|$|Bone cement {{has proven}} {{particularly}} useful because specific <b>active</b> <b>substances,</b> e.g. antibiotics, {{can be added}} to the powder component. The <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> are released locally after implant placement of the new joint, i.e. in the immediate vicinity of the new prosthesis and have been confirmed to reduce the danger of infection.
