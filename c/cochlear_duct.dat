5|$|As the {{cochlear}} duct’s mesenchyme begins to differentiate, three cavities are formed: the scala vestibuli, the scala tympani and the scala media. Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani contain an extracellular fluid called perilymph. The scala media contains endolymph. A set of membranes called the vestibular membrane and the basilar membrane develop {{to separate the}} <b>cochlear</b> <b>duct</b> from the vestibular duct and the tympanic duct, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Around the 33rd day of development, the vesicles {{begin to}} {{differentiate}}. Closer {{to the back}} of the embryo, they form what will become the utricle and semicircular canals. Closer to the front of the embryo, the vesicles differentiate into a rudimentary saccule, which will eventually become the saccule and cochlea. Part of the saccule will eventually give rise and connect to the <b>cochlear</b> <b>duct.</b> This duct appears approximately during the sixth week and connects to the saccule through the ductus reuniens.|$|E
5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the <b>cochlear</b> <b>duct,</b> and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this article, a {{nonlinear}} {{mathematical model}} is developed {{based on the}} physiology of the cochlea of the guinea pig. The three-dimensional intracochlear fluid dynamics are coupled to a micromechanical model of the organ of Corti and to electrical potentials in the <b>cochlear</b> <b>ducts</b> and outer hair cells (OHC). OHC somatic electromotility is modeled by linearized piezoelectric relations whereas the OHC hair-bundle mechanoelectrical transduction current is modeled as a nonlinear function of the hair-bundle deflection. The steady-state response of the cochlea to a single tone is simulated in the frequency domain using an alternating frequency time scheme. Compressive nonlinearity, harmonic distortion, and DC shift on the basilar membrane (BM), tectorial membrane (TM), and OHC potentials are predicted using a single set of parameters. The predictions of the model are verified by comparing simulations to available in vivo experimental data for basal cochlear mechanics. In particular, the model predicts more amplification on the reticular lamina (RL) side of the cochlear partition than on the BM, which replicates recent measurements. Moreover, small harmonic distortion and DC shifts are predicted on the BM, whereas more significant harmonic distortion and DC shifts are predicted in the RL and TM displacements and in the OHC potentials...|$|R
25|$|Beginning in {{the fifth}} week of development, the {{auditory}} vesicle also {{gives rise to the}} <b>cochlear</b> <b>duct,</b> which contains the spiral organ of Corti and the endolymph that accumulates in the membranous labyrinth.

25|$|The {{lengthwise}} partition {{that divides}} {{most of the}} cochlea is itself a fluid-filled tube, the third duct. This central column is called the <b>cochlear</b> <b>duct.</b> Its fluid, endolymph, also contains electrolytes and proteins, but is chemically quite different from perilymph. Whereas the perilymph is rich in sodium ions, the endolymph is rich in potassium ions, which produces an ionic, electrical potential.|$|E
40|$|The {{mammalian}} {{inner ear}} is a sensory system with high sensitivity and sharp tuning {{in response to}} low intensity sounds. These important characteristics are due to the active feedback by outer hair cells (OHCs) that amplify the vibrations of the fluid-loaded cochlear partition. In order to simulate {{the dynamics of the}} cochlea in response to sounds, many cochlear models are formulated in the frequency domain or using a one-dimensional formulation to reduce the computational cost. However, some aspects of nonlinear cochlear mechanics can only investigated using a three-dimensional time-domain model. We present here the development of a novel time-domain model of the mammalian cochlea formulated using a state-space approach. A three-dimensional model of the intracochlear fluids is coupled to a structural model of the cochlear partition using a finite element framework. Moreover, electrical degrees of freedom represent the electrical degrees of freedom in the <b>cochlear</b> <b>ducts</b> and in the OHCs. The active feedback by OHCs is modeled by linearized piezoelectric relationships, whereas the nonlinearity of the OHC mechanoelectrical transduction channels introduces nonlinearity in the model. This computational framework is used to simulate the nonlinear response of the mammalian ear to sounds. After calibration using measurements using in vivo measurements of the response of the cochlea to sounds, the model can be used to test hypotheses regarding hearing mechanics to help us to improve our understanding of the biophysics and biomechanics of the mammalian ear...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPreparation of the {{temporal}} bone for light microscopy is an important step in histological studies of the inner ear. Due to the complexity of structures of the inner ear, it is difficult to measure or compare structures of interest without a commonly accepted standardized measure of temporal bone sections. Therefore, standardization of temporal bone sections is very important for histological assessment of sensory hair cells and peripheral ganglion neurons in the cochlear and vestibular systems. The standardized temporal bone sectioning is oriented to a plane parallel to the outer and internal auditory canals. Sections are collected from the epitympanum to the hypotympanum to reveal layers in the order of the crista ampullaris of the superior and lateral semicircular canals, macula utriculi and macula sacculi, superior vestibular ganglion neurons, macula of saccule and inferior vestibular ganglion neurons, <b>cochlear</b> modiolus, endolymphatic <b>duct</b> and endolymphatic sac, and finally the crista ampullaris of the posterior semicircular canal. Moreover, technical details of preparing for temporal bone sectioning including fixation, decalcification, whole temporal bone staining, embedding penetration, and embedding orientation are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} bionics is rapidly {{realising}} {{the potential to}} restore sensory and motor function lost through genetics, aging, the environment, or misadventure. The cochlear implant (CI) is the most advanced and widely utilised bionic prosthesis. Hundreds of thousands of severely hearing impaired individuals have taken the opportunity to perceive sound and improve their speech capability through implantation of the CI electrode array. The performance of the modern CI, or &# 145;bionic ear&# 146;, is largely constrained by the neural interface itself. The broad monopolar stimulation that CIs employ to stimulate the auditory nerve, using up to 22 electrodes, vastly reduces the potential for pitch discrimination that is tonotopically mapped by thousands of hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) {{along the length of}} the cochlea. We show in a deafened guinea pig model that neurotrophin gene therapy integrated into the cochlear implantation procedure can significantly improve neural recruitment. We utilised the CI array for novel &# 145;close-field&# 146; electroporation (CFE) to efficiently transduce mesenchymal cells lining the <b>cochlear</b> perilymphatic <b>ducts</b> with naked plasmid DNA driving brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. BDNF transgene expression caused regeneration of the SGN peripheral neurites to close apposition with the CI microarray, with localised ectopic branching. This neural remodelling lowered activation thresholds and expanded the dynamic range of the cochlear nerve using bipolar stimulation between internal electrodes of the CI to electrically evoke auditory brainstem responses. Electric field mapping of the CI-based gene electrotransfer pulses using an HEK 293 cell monolayer model showed that a parallel multi-nodal (tandem) configuration of the electrodes generated comparatively high electric fields close to the array, resulting in surprisingly efficient and directed transfection of cells in a spherical shape. An &# 145;alternating&# 146; CI array configuration produced a linear shaped field of transduced cells; demonstrating the potential for this focal gene delivery platform to control the size and shape of transduced cell fields. These proof of principal studies showing enhanced bionic interface performance with CFE BDNF gene delivery and the &# 145;dial-up&# 146; control of the gene electrotransfer highlights the broad potential of this platform for local gene therapy applications within molecular medicine...|$|R
25|$|In {{theory of}} hearing physiology, the {{traveling}} wave (TW) of Von Bekesy, resulted from an acoustic surface {{wave of the}} basilar membrane into the <b>cochlear</b> <b>duct.</b> His theory pretended to explain every feature of the auditory sensation owing to these passive mechanical phenomena.

25|$|The {{vibrations}} of the endolymph in the <b>cochlear</b> <b>duct</b> {{displace the}} basilar membrane {{in a pattern}} that peaks {{a distance from the}} oval window depending upon the soundwave frequency. The organ of Corti vibrates due to outer hair cells further amplifying these vibrations. Inner hair cells are then displaced by the vibrations in the fluid, and depolarise by an influx of K+ via their tip-link-connected channels, and send their signals via neurotransmitter to the primary auditory neurons of the spiral ganglion.|$|E
25|$|In most {{reptiles}} the perilymphatic duct and lagena {{are relatively}} short, and the sensory cells {{are confined to}} a small basilar papilla lying between them. However, in birds, mammals, and crocodilians, these structures become much larger and somewhat more complicated. In birds, crocodilians, and monotremes, the ducts are simply extended, together forming an elongated, more or less straight, tube. The endolymphatic duct is wrapped in a simple loop around the lagena, with the basilar membrane lying along one side. The {{first half of the}} duct is now referred to as the scala vestibuli, while the second half, which includes the basilar membrane, is called the scala tympani. As a result of this increase in length, the basilar membrane and papilla are both extended, with the latter developing into the organ of Corti, while the lagena is now called the <b>cochlear</b> <b>duct.</b> All of these structures together constitute the cochlea.|$|E

2500|$|The coiled form of cochlea {{is unique}} to mammals. In birds and in other non-mammalian vertebrates, the {{compartment}} containing the sensory cells for hearing is occasionally also called [...] "cochlea," [...] despite not being coiled up. Instead, it forms a blind-ended tube, also called the <b>cochlear</b> <b>duct.</b> This difference apparently evolved in parallel with the differences in frequency range of hearing between mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates. The superior frequency range in mammals {{is partly due to}} their unique mechanism of pre-amplification of sound by active cell-body vibrations of outer hair cells. Frequency resolution is, however, not better in mammals than in most lizards and birds, but the upper frequency limit is – sometimes much – higher. Most bird species do not hear above 45kHz, the currently known maximum being ~ 11kHz in the barn owl. Some marine mammals hear up to 200kHz. A long coiled compartment, rather than a short and straight one, provides more space for additional octaves of hearing range, and has made possible some of the highly derived behaviors involving mammalian hearing.|$|E
