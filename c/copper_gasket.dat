5000|$|Several vacuum flange {{standards}} exist, and {{the same}} flange types are called by different names by different manufacturers and standards organizations.CF (ConFlat) flanges use a <b>copper</b> <b>gasket</b> and knife-edge flange to achieve an ultrahigh vacuum seal. The term [...] "ConFlat" [...] is a registered trademark of Varian, Inc., so [...] "CF" [...] is commonly used by other flange manufacturers. Each face of the two mating CF flanges has a knife edge, which cuts into the softer metal gasket, providing an extremely leak-tight, metal-to-metal seal. Deformation of the metal gasket fills small defects in the flange, allowing Conflat flanges operate down to 10−13 Torr (10−11 Pa) pressure. The knife edge is recessed in a groove in each flange. In addition to protecting the knife edge, the groove helps hold the gasket in place, which aligns the two flanges and also reduces gasket expansion during bake-out. For stainless-steel conflat flanges, baking temperatures of 450 °C can be achieved; the temperature {{is limited by the}} choice of gasket material. CF flanges are sexless and interchangeable. In North America, flange sizes are given by flange outer diameter in inches, while in Europe and Asia, sizes are given by tube inner diameter in millimeters. Despite the different naming conventions, the actual flanges are the same.|$|E

40|$|All-metal joints {{are widely}} used in the vacuum systems of {{particle}} accelerators. The most common ConFlat® design consists of a flat soft <b>copper</b> <b>gasket</b> captured between two stainless steel flanges with sharp edges (knives). The gasket is plastically deformed and a high contact pressure develops around knives to obtain leak tightness. For large accelerators, a high reliability and a cost-optimized design are required. A smooth internal transition between flanges is needed for the RF waveguides of the compact linear collider (CLIC), with limited deformation of the inner part of the gasket. We present the study of a flange meeting these requirements. First the finite element analysis (FEA) of the Stanford linear accelerator center (SLAC) X-band all-metal joint, which has a similar specification, is shown. Some drawbacks, such as non-homogeneous sealing properties, are highlighted. Then, a new joint design is described. FEA results are presented and are compared with experimental measurements carried out on prototypes...|$|E
40|$|Vacuum seals {{are very}} {{important}} to ensure that the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Linac has an optimum vacuum system. The vacuum joints between flanges must have reliable seals to minimize the leak rate and meet vacuum and electrical requirements. In addition, it is desirable to simplify the installation and thereby also simplify the maintenance required. This report summarizes an investigation of the metal vacuum seals that include the metal C-seal, Energized Spring seal, Helcoflex Copper Delta seal, Aluminum Delta seal, delta seal with limiting ring, and the prototype of the copper diamond seals. The report also contains the material certifications, design, finite element analysis, and testing for all of these seals. It is a valuable reference for any vacuum system design. To evaluate the suitability of several types of metal seals for use in the SNS Linac and to determine the torque applied on the bolts, a series of vacuum leak rate tests on the metal seals have been completed at Los Alamos Laboratory. A copper plated flange, using the same type of delta seal that was used for testing with the stainless steel flange, has also been studied and tested. A vacuum seal is desired that requires significantly less loading than a standard ConFlat flange with a <b>copper</b> <b>gasket</b> for the coupling cavity assembly. To save the intersegment space the authors use thinner flanges in the design. The leak rate of the thin ConFlat flange with a <b>copper</b> <b>gasket</b> is a baseline for the vacuum test on all seals and thin flanges. A finite element analysis of a long coupling cavity flange with a copper delta seal has been performed in order to confirm the design of the long coupling cavity flange and the welded area of a cavity body with the flange. This analysis is also necessary to predict a potential deformation of the cavity under the combined force of atmospheric pressure and the seating load of the seal. Modeling of this assembly has been achieved using both HKS/Abaqus and COSMOS/M, which are finite element packages for analysis of coupled, nonlinear problems. From these studies, the appropriate seals that are reliable for SNS long coupling cavities and beamline joints were determined...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStandard {{circular}} ConFlat® (CF) flanges {{are widely}} used in industry due to their high sealing reliability after being subjected to a bakeout process.

50|$|The Lancia Flavia was {{developed}} by Professor Antonio Fessia in the late 1950s, and introduced {{for sale in the}} UK in 1961. Initially available only as a four-door saloon, it featured a 1.5 L aluminium boxer engine, Dunlop disc brakes on all four wheels, front-wheel drive and front suspension by unequal-length wishbones. This model was soon joined by a two-door coupé, designed by Pininfarina on a shortened platform. Vignale built 1,601 two-door convertibles, while Zagato designed an outlandish-looking light weight two-door sport version. The sport version has twin carburetors for extra power (just over 100 hp/75 kW); however, this version of the engine was notoriously difficult to keep in tune. Even the single-carburettor engine suffered from the problem of timing chain stretch. Sprockets with vernier adjusters were fitted to allow for chain wear, and the cam timing was supposed to be checked every 6000 miles. Early cars also suffered from corrosion of the cylinder heads caused by using <b>copper</b> <b>gaskets</b> on aluminium heads; nevertheless, the car was quite lively for its day, considering the cubic capacity. When leaving the factory Flavias originally fitted either Pirelli Cinturato 165HR14 tyres (CA67) or Pirelli Cinturato 155HR15 tyres (CA67).|$|R
40|$|Nowadays helium {{permeation}} leaks are {{the most}} diffused leaks in the lowest flow range, but its flow rate is temperature dependent. On the contrary, orifice leaks has a low coefficient temperature, {{but they have a}} size (about 1 µm) that limits their applicability in the lowest flow range. The Focused Ion Beam is used in widespread fields, both technological and scientific, from nano-technology to semiconductor and material science applications. In the last years a class of Dual Beam workstations, combining a FIB column with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), appeared on the market making easier to treat materials at nano-scale with precise metrology. By means of FIB it is now possible to produce orifices with a diameter on the nanoscale that allow to have flow rates, with 1 atm of pressure differential, comparable to the ranges obtained with permeation leaks. In this work we present a method to produce orifices having a diameter at nanometer scale. The orifices can be used for any gas, including mixtures, and can change continuously the flow rate simply varying the inlet pressure.

40|$|A {{multifaceted}} {{program to}} study high gradient structures and properties of RF breakdown {{is under way}} at SLAC. This program includes testing of simplified versions of traveling wave and standing wave structures at 11. 4 GHz. [Dolgashev] RF power is fed into these structures using a TE 01 mode-launcher. An RF flange is used to connect the mode-launcher to the test-structure. The rf currents flow through either the stainless steel lip on the flange or, in an alternate assembly, through a <b>copper</b> <b>gasket</b> pressed between the same stainless steel lips. In a recent experiment with a single cell traveling wave structure, a flange with stainless steel lips was irreversibly damaged at RF power about 90 MW and {approx} 100 ns pulse length. We suggest an alternative flange that does not rely on metal-to-metal contact in the rf power transfer region. The idea is to use an asymmetric choke flange, where the choke grove is cut into a conflate flange on the mode-launcher. The structures themselves will have a simpler, flat conflate flange with rounded corners on the vacuum side. The Vacuum seal is achieved with a Cu gasket between these two flanges above the RF region. We have designed a flange with a choke which is almost field free in the vacuum gasket region, whose technical specifications and RF properties are presented below. Design simulations were conducted using HFSS, a 3 D finite element code that solves electromagnetic fields in complex structures. Figure 1 demonstrates the projected physical look of the choke flange, while {{the table next to}} it lists the critical parameters.

30|$|The entire {{setup is}} housed in a four-fold {{differentially}} pumped vacuum chamber. The four chambers, {{described in more detail}} in the next sections, are a source chamber, a chamber housing the guides, a chamber where the collisions are detected, and a chamber to characterise the two molecular beams. Source and guide chamber are constructed using ISO-F and ISO-K type flanges with Viton or other rubber gaskets. The last two use CF flanges with <b>copper</b> <b>gaskets.</b> The adapter tube to make the transition between these standards is also the one that provides the kink, which is necessary because of the bend in the guides. A commercial half-nipple with an ISO-F flange was welded to a CF flange with a 10 -degree tilt between the flange faces. This separation in two standards was chosen for simplicity (and cost), and because other than continuity {{there is no reason to}} use the CF standard on a source chamber where the pressure during operation usually lies above 10 − 5 mbar. Our target pressure for the guide and collision chambers was in the range of 10 − 8 mbar. Even in that range no significant losses are to be expected from collisions of guided molecules with background gas. Bake-out of the apparatus is not only not required, it also is not possible because the permanent magnets must be expected to start demagnetising at temperatures above ≈ 60 °C.|$|R

These cars were meant only as prototypes. Broadspeed {{came up with a}} somewhat special solution, and used a combination of a Holset 3LDG turbocharger, and a carburettor mounted inside a big plenum chamber. The engine itself was fitted with a thicker <b>copper</b> head <b>gasket,</b> and as such the compression ratio was lowered to 7.6:1. The outcome was a 1.9-litre engine which generated , with acceleration of 0-60 in 7.6 seconds.

The turbocharger had halved the economy of the car, and building it was also costly. Therefore Opel closed the project, leaving the five cars as the total production number. However a British engineer at the Dealer Opel Team (D.O.T.), which was the British importer and builder of Opel cars in Britain, was so enthusiastic about the cars that he had D.O.T. build an additional 28 cars. The cars were all based on the 1974 luxury Berlinetta model, with full gauge packs, automatic transmissions, and alloy wheels. All 28 cars were black with vinyl roofing. The only thing identifying that the car was indeed a Turbo Manta was a small sign at the rear quarter of the rear wings saying [...] "turbo". Very few of these cars still remain today.|$|R
40|$|The Project Management and Engineering Branch (SF 4) {{supports}} the Human Health and Performance Directorate (HH&P) and {{is responsible for}} developing and supporting human systems hardware for the International Space Station (ISS). When a principal investigator's (PI) medical research project on the ISS is accepted, SF 4 develops the necessary hardware and software to transport to the ISS. The two projects I primarily worked on were the centrifuge and ultrasound projects. Centrifuge: One concern with spacecraft such as the ISS is electromagnetic interference (EMI) from onboard equipment, typically from radio waves (frequencies of ~ 3 kHz to ~ 300 GHz), which can negatively affect nearby circuitry. Standard commercial centrifuges produce EMI above safety limits, so my task was to help reduce EMI production from this equipment. Two centrifuges were tested: one unmodified as a control and one modified. To reduce EMI below safety limits, one centrifuge was modified to become a Faraday shield, in which significant electrical contact was made between all regions of the centrifuge housing. This included removing non-conductive paint, applying conductive fabric to the lid and foam sealer, adding a 10, 000 F decoupling capacitor across the power supply, and adding <b>copper</b> adhesive-mount <b>gaskets</b> to the housing interior. EMI testing of both centrifuges was performed in the EMI/EMC Control Test and Measurement Facility. EMI for both centrifuges was below safety limits for frequencies between 10 MHz and 15 GHz (pass); however, between 14 kHz and 10 MHz, EMI for the unmodified centrifuge exceeded safety limits (fail) as expected. Alternatively, for the modified centrifuge with the Faraday shield, EMI was below the safely limit of 55 dBV/m for electromagnetic frequencies between 14 kHz and 10 MHz. This result indicates our modifications were successful. The successful EMI test allowed us {{to communicate with the}} vendor what modifications they needed to make to their commercial unit to meet our specifications and to understand {{what needs to be done}} in lab to the new centrifuge. Our modifications will provide a standard for readying centrifuges for future missions. Once the new modified centrifuge arrives by the vendor, it will need to undergo EMI testing again for validation. The centrifuge is also in the process of compatibility testing with a custom stowage drawer, which is an ongoing project in SF 4. Both of these items will be payloads on future missions to the ISS for various research purposes. Ultrasound: ISS currently has an onboard ultrasound (Ultrasound 2 system) for research and medical purposes. Every piece of medical flight hardware has an equivalent ground-unit so instrumentation can be routinely evaluated and transported to the ISS if necessary. The ground-unit ultrasound equipment must be evaluated every six months using a task performance sheet (TPS). A TPS is a document, written by the appropriate scientists and engineers, which describes how to run equipment and is written in such a way that astronauts with unspecialized training can follow the tasks. I was responsible for performing six TPSs on a combination of three ultrasounds and two video power converters (VPCs). Performing a TPS involves checking out and computationally documenting each piece of equipment removed from storage locations, setting up hardware and software, performing tasks to verify functionality, returning equipment, and logging items back into the computerized system. My work revealed all ground-unit ultrasounds were functioning properly. Because of proper function, a discrepancy report (DR) did not have to be opened. The TPS was then passed along to the Quality Engineering (QE) for review and ultimately given to Quality Assurance (QA). Other projects: In addition to my main projects, I participated in other tasks including troubleshooting an EEG headband, volunteering for an ultrasound training research study, and conformal coating printed circuit boards.
