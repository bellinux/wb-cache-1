50|$|Once INM:chromatin {{interactions}} {{have been}} established following formation of the nuclear envelope, soluble nuclear proteins may bind to exposed chromosomal segments. Such proteins could include enzymes that modify histones—such as methylases and acetylases—which act to alter the three-dimensional conformation of chromatin, as well as DNA binding proteins—such as helicases, gyrases, and transcription factors—that are involved in unwinding/looping DNA and/or recruiting RNAP holoenzyme. This will promote the transcription of some genes and down-regulate or prevent transcription of others. Thus, the nuclear scaffold places limits on what genes <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be expressed within a given cell and, hence, may serve a basis for cell identity.|$|E

Manson was the leader of the Manson Family cult that resided in California in the late 1960s. In 1969, the Manson Family committed nine murders across a five-week span. One of the more notable people murdered was actress Sharon Tate. Charles Manson did not commit any of the murders himself, but instructed the members of the Manson Family to do it instead. In 1971, Manson was convicted on the charge of conspiracy. The court ruled that Manson had as much guilt tied to him with that of his followers. Manson is currently serving 9 concurrent life sentences at the Corcoran State prison in California.|$|E
5000|$|Food-storing ravens cache (hoard) {{their food}} and pilfer (steal) from other ravens' caches. They protect their caches from being pilfered by conspeciﬁcs using aggression, {{dominance}} and re-caching. Potential pilferers rarely approach caches until the storing birds {{have left the}} cache vicinity. When storers are experimentally prevented from leaving {{the vicinity of the}} cache, pilferers ﬁrst search at places other than the cache sites. When ravens (Corvus corax) witness a conspeciﬁc making caches, to pilfer those caches they (1) delay approaching the cache only when {{in the presence of the}} storer, and (2) quickly engage in searching away from the caches when together with dominant storers. These behaviours raise the possibility that ravens are capable of withholding their intentions, and also providing false information to avoid provoking the storer's aggression to protect its cache. Ravens adjust their pilfering behaviour according to when the storers are likely to defend the caches. This supports the suggestion that they are deceptively manipulating the other's behaviour. [...] Other studies indicate that ravens recall whom was watching them during caching, but also know the effects of visual barriers on what competitors <b>can</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> see, and how this affects their pilfering.|$|E
50|$|Secrecy and {{censorship}} {{can involve}} norms about {{the control of}} information. This idea was integrated by saying that Censorship of communication in the modern sense is associated with large, complex urban societies {{with a degree of}} centralized control and technical means of effectively reaching a mass audience. It involves a determination of what <b>can,</b> <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> (or in the case of non-governmental efforts should and should not) be expressed in light of given political, religious, cultural, and artistic standards. The appearance of new communications (e.g., the printing press or the Internet) technologies invariably create demands from conflicting groups for greater openness and freedom of communication and demands for greater control. Authorities try (often in vain) to control new techniques of mass communication. Three major means of direct censorship (pre-publication review, licensing and registration, and government monopolization) are preventive in nature. Among democracies there is considerable variation in censorship by content, media of communication, place, time period and across societies. There are degrees of censorship and individual interests are balanced against those of the community, however hard the latter is to define. More common than outright prohibition, is the segmentation of material involving time, place and person restrictions. Direct government means of censorship must be considered separately from the availability of resources to create and distribute information, the activities of private groups and from informal censorship, including exclusion from sources of information and self-censorship. In a democratic society secrecy and openness exist in a continual dynamic tension.|$|E

40|$|Physical {{processes}} are often modeled as input-output systems. Many such systems obey passivity, {{which means that}} power is dissipated in the process. This thesis deals with the inevitable constraints imposed on physical systems due to passivity. A general approach to derive sum rules and physical limitations on passive systems is presented. The sum rules relate the dynamical behaviour of a system to its static and/or high-frequency properties. This is beneficial, since static properties are in general easier to determine. The physical limitations indicate what <b>can,</b> <b>and</b> what <b>can</b> <b>not,</b> be expected from certain passive systems. At {{the core of the}} general approach is a set of integral identities for Herglotz functions, a function class intimately related to the transfer functions of passive systems. In this thesis, the general approach is also applied to a specific problem: the scattering and absorption of electromagnetic vector spherical waves by various objects. Physical limitations are derived, which limit the absorption of power from each individual spherical wave. They are particularly useful for electrically small scatterers. The results can be used in many fields where an understanding of the interaction between electromagnetic waves and matter is vital. One interesting application is within antenna theory, where the limitations are helpful from a designer's viewpoint; they can give an understanding as to what factors limit performance, and also indicate if there is room for improvement or not...|$|R

40|$|According to {{observational}} {{and theoretical}} data the solar flare radiation and coronal mass ejection(CME) are {{manifestations of the}} same explosive process, which takes place high in the solar corona. In some solar flares one of these manifestations <b>can</b> be weak <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be observed, in other flares both of these manifestations are present.

For solar flare and CME predictions, it is need to have information about main processes of these explosive phenomena and to estimate the possibility of their occurrences. The energy for solar flare can be accumulated in a current sheet. For MHD simulation of this process the program PERESVET is developed that uses observed distributions of magnetic field on the photosphere as the boundary conditions. The MHD simulation showed, that the current sheet can be vertical, horizontal, or inclined to some angles to the photosphere depending on the magnetic field distribution on the photosphere and its evolution. The vertical current sheet can produce the CME, because the magnetic tension force accelerates plasma from the Sun. The CME prognosis is based on information about the position of current sheet in the solar corona...|$|R

The dynamics of m species in n gradostat vessels is described by a system of mn ordinary differential equations. Using the results on the coexistence of two species, with the aid of the method of lower and upper solutions for systems with quasimonotone reaction terms, we are able to give general sufficient conditions for the persistence of n species in m vessels. For the case of 3 species, we are able to improve these conditions and construct a positively invariant region corresponding to each species concentration remaining strictly positive. For this we first look for conditions a species would need to fulfill in order to survive when introduced into a gradostat already containing two species at two-species persistent equilibrium concentration levels. Moreover, through a bifurcation analysis we can partially describe the region in the parameter space corresponding to persistence, and give numerous numerical examples of coexistence when our sufficient persistence conditions are fulfilled...|$|R

40|$|After a brief {{introduction}} to some core {{questions in the}} history of the book, such as the relationship between form and content, this article investigates the concept of facsimile and its use, and discusses a range of documents that go by the name of “facsimile”. The prevailing definitions of the term “facsimile” focus on the technical means of reproduction and the “exactness” of the copy. However, these definitions do not manage to distinguish the concept of facsimile, from that of a “copy” or “reproduction”. In spite of this and notwithstanding the rich diversity of products within the genre of facsimile, there seems to be a considerable consensus as to what <b>can,</b> <b>and</b> what <b>can</b> <b>not,</b> be called a facsimile. The common denominator – be it a digitized letter, a printed page reproduced in low resolution and presented in PDF-format, or a costly recreation of an entire manuscript complete with gold decoration and worm-holes – is the idea that the form of the original document produces meaning. But what is the nature of the meaning produced? Special attention is given to the so called, "art facsimiles", and the use of facsimiles within edition philology. As to the former, the facsimile is often presented as a re-creation of the original document. Its precious materials and meticulous workmanship appeal to the sensual experience of the facsimile as a physical object. As for the latter, facsimiles are used as tools for analysis, and are perceived as reproductions of texts as images bringing into focus, understanding as opposed to sensing. With Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht’s theoretical concept of “presence” and “presence production”, the comparison sheds light on the diverse effects and functions of facsimiles...|$|R

They all agreed that the unfortunate Captain Martin must have been unacquainted with the truth as to what <b>can</b> <b>and</b> what <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be done with a Steamship having rigging and canvas; and that no sailor would dream of turning a ship's stern to such a gale--unless his vessel could run faster than the sea. ---- said (and the other two confirmed) that the London was the better for everything that she lost aloft in such a gale, and that with her head kept to the wind by means of a storm topsail--which is hoisted from the deck and requires no man to be sent aloft, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> be set under the worst circumstances--the disaster could not have occurred. If he had no such sail, he could have improvised it, even of hammocks and the like.
