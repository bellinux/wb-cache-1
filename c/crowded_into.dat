At one talk in Lyon, France, 1000 people <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> the auditorium and 700 were turned away. In 1905 Fanny became the second woman {{to address the}} Royal Geographical Society.

5|$|In July 1995, {{forces of}} the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) {{captured}} the town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia, which had been cut off and surrounded {{despite the presence of}} soldiers from the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Thousands of refugees had <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> the town to escape the Serb advance. Following the Serb takeover of Srebrenica, an estimated 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were systematically massacred by Serb forces between 11–15 July and another 25,000–30,000 were subjected to ethnic cleansing. It was the largest act of mass murder in Europe since World War II.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, {{agitation}} grew in Alaska for {{the territory}} {{to become a}} state. Alaskans could not vote in presidential elections and had a territorial legislature with limited powers. Efforts to lobby federal legislators for an Alaska statehood bill met with limited success, so prominent territorial officials decided to draft a state constitution to prove Alaska's readiness to become a state. On November 8, 1955, 55 elected delegates gathered at the University of Alaska to begin drafting a state constitution. The resulting debates lasted {{more than two months}} and caused a sensation in Fairbanks. Debates of the constitutional convention were broadcast on Fairbanks radio, and the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner dedicated daily reports to the progress of the convention. On February 5, 1956, the delegates signed the constitution in front of 1,000 people who <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> the University of Alaska gymnasium. The building where deliberations took place was subsequently named Constitution Hall.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} improbability of landfall {{in the days}} preceding the storm's passage, the West Palm Beach chapter of the American Red Cross began preparing for the storm. Dr. William J. Buck, likely the only doctor between Pahokee and Moore Haven and also president of the Belle Glade town council {{and the founder of}} the town's American Legion post, was skeptical of the Weather Bureau's predictions of the storm missing South Florida. He and his legionnaires warned residents in the Lake Okeechobee region of the approaching cyclone. At South Bay, Frank Schuster made several car trips to save 211 people by transporting them to higher ground. The Seminoles at the Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation in Glades County evacuated to higher ground after observing retreating wildlife. Hours before the storm made landfall, many in the communities surrounding Lake Okeechobee either <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> a house or evacuated to the building they believed was securest, such as the Belle Glade Hotel, the Glades Hotel, and Henry Martin's store in Belle Glade, with the Glades Hotel sheltering 20 people and the Belle Glade Hotel having nearly 150 refugees. About 500 people in Lake Worth were sheltered inside the Gulf Stream Hotel during the storm. In West Palm Beach, food and thousands of candles, kerosene lamps, and boards were sold on September 16. A number of residents boarded up their homes and then secured their ornamental trees and plants. At the building then being used as the Palm Beach County Courthouse, approximately 500 people sought shelter inside. In Jupiter, 20 people sought refuge in a grocery store, while 25 others stayed at a newly constructed elementary school. A number of African Americans took shelter in a school building in West Jupiter.|$|E

25|$|Between 1850 and 1900, sweatshops {{attracted}} {{the rural poor}} to rapidly growing cities, and attracted immigrants to places such as London and New York City's garment district, located near the tenements of New York's Lower East Side. These sweatshops incurred criticism: labour leaders cited them as crowded, poorly ventilated, and prone to fires and rat infestations: in many cases, there were many workers <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> small tenement rooms.|$|E

25|$|During a 1944 Red Cross visit, {{and in a}} {{propaganda}} film, the Nazis presented Theresienstadt to outsiders as a model Jewish settlement, {{but it was a}} concentration camp.

Whereas some survivors claimed the prison population reached 75,000 at one time, according to official records, the highest figure reached (on September 18, 1942) was 58,491. They were <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> barracks designed to accommodate 7,000 combat troops.|$|E
25|$|Throughout June and July, as Turkish and Russian forces battled to {{the north}} of the Van region, {{thousands}} of Armenians from Mush and other neighbouring provinces started flooding into the city of Van. There were as many as 250,000 Armenians <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> the city. This included people who broke away from the deportation columns as they passed the vicinity of the province on their way to Mosul. Before the crisis, the city of Van had housed and fed no more than 50,000 people.|$|E

He reached there with 16,000 soldiers on 12 September 1796, but was defeated and driven into the fortress by the French on the 15th. With Wurmser's Austrians and the original garrison <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> the encircled city, disease and hunger began exacting a serious toll on the garrison.|$|E
