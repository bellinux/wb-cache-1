Analyses data to determine nematode log egg counts in different seasons (i. e. long rainy season from June to September, dry season - from October to February and short rainy season from March to May) in the chiefly natural-grazing (Debre Berhan and Tulu Meko) and stubble-grazing (Deneba, Dejen and Wereilu) groups of sheep separately.

For this purpose, herbage {{samples were collected}} from a posture near Faisalabad at fortnightly intervals over a 12 month period from July 2000 to June 2001. The larvae of Haemonchus (H) contortus, Trichostrongylus species, Ostertagia species and Cooperia (C) curticei were recorded from the pasture throughout the year.

The number of larvae on pasture was {{directly related to the}} rainfall pattern which was found {{to be the most important}} factor for the development of eggs and free-living stages. Haemonchus was the predominant genus, followed in decreasing order by Trichostrongylus, Cooperia, Oesophagostomum and Bunostomum. The mean total adult worm burdens of tracer calves released at monthly intervals were related to the levels of herbage larvae and there was a positive correlation between faecal worm egg counts and worm burdens (r= 0. 58) during the study period.

Epidemiological data generated from an on-station experiment involving the use of tracer lambs and monitoring <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>contamination</b> levels in the central Ethiopian highlands clearly showed a distinct seasonal pattern of nematode infection in sheep. Investigations into the occurrence and implications of periparturient rise in tricho-strongylid egg output in breeding ewes over the lambing and lactation period are discussed. A trial to determine the seasonal pattern of egg development and larval survival on pasture was carried out over a period of 12 months. Preliminary findings from this study suggest that the relatively short larval survival times (6 to 8 weeks) present an opportunity for manipulation of the parasite population dynamics in the cool tropics. Results from the combination of these different studies serve as a basis for medium-term control strategies in this environment and others with similar climatic conditions. Because these strategies will depend heavily upon the use of anthelmintics, it is lkely that, if understood by extension workers and accepted by farmers, they will form a basis for development of programmes for preventing production losses due to parasitism in young stock by reducing the number of treatments and therefore the risk of development of anthelmintic resistance.

At early times following an accident, the direct <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> and food stuffs, particularly leafy vegetation and grain, can be of great importance. This situation has been modeled extensively. However, models employed then to predict the deposition, retention and transport of radionuclides in terrestrial environments employed concepts and data bases that {{were more than a}} decade old. The extent to which these models have been tested with independent data sets was limited. The data gathered in the former-USSR (and elsewhere throughout the Northern Hemisphere) offered a unique opportunity to test model predictions of wet and dry deposition, agricultural foodchain bioaccumulation, and short- and long-term retention, redistribution, and resuspension of radionuclides from a variety of natural and artificial surfaces.

40|$|Prion {{proteins}} (PrP) are {{the main}} responsible for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE). The TSE etiological agent is a misfolded form of the normal cellular prion protein. The amyloidal aggregates accumulated in the brain of infected animals and mainly composed of PrPSc exhibit resistance to protease attack and many conventional inactivating procedures. The prion protein diseases cause an environmental issue because the environment {{and in particular the}} soil compartment can be contaminated and then become a potential reservoir and diffuser of TSEs infectivity as a consequence of (i) accidental dispersion from storage plants of meat and bone meal, (ii) incorporation of contaminated material in fertilizers, (iii) possible natural <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> soils by grazing herds, and (v) burial of carcasses. The environmental problem can be even more relevant because very low amounts of PrPSc are able to propagate the disease. Several studies evidenced that infectious prion protein remains active in soils for years. Contaminated soils result, thus, a possible critical route of TSE transmission in wild animals. Soil can also protect prion protein toward degradation processes due to the presence of humic substances and inorganic components such as clays. Mineral and organic colloids and the more common association between clay minerals and humic substances can contribute to the adsorption/entrapment of molecules and macromolecules. The polymerization of organic monomeric humic precursors occurring in soil in the presence of oxidative enzymes or manganese and iron oxides, {{is considered one of the}} most important processes contributing to the formation of humic substances. The process is very fast and produces a population of polymeric products of different molecular structures, sizes, shapes and complexity. Other molecules and possibly biomacromolecules such as proteins may be involved. The aim of the present work was to study by CPMAS 13 C-NMR the interactions between a non pathogenic ovine recombinant prion protein and a model soil system represented by a manganese oxide in the form of birnessite (-MnO 2), coated with a polymerized catechol. To better understand the effect of the polymerization process, PrP was added to the birnessite-cathecol system either before or after the polymerization processes. The NMR spectra of the prion protein interacting directly with birnessite revealed disappearance of the signals due to the paramagnetic nature of manganese oxide or abiotic degradation. Conversely, the signal pattern of the protein re-appeared as it is mixed to the soil-like system either during or after the catechol polymerization process. Results suggested that the possible interactions of the prion protein on soil systems can be mediated by natural organic matter. However, deeper studies on more complex real soil systems are needed to definitely confirm such hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|Research into {{transmissible}} {{spongiform encephalopathy}} (TSE) diseases has become a high priority worldwide in recent years yet remarkably {{little is known about}} the behaviour of TSE infectivity in the environment. The resilience and stability of prion proteins could lead to soils becoming a potential reservoir of TSE infectivity as a result <b>of</b> <b>contamination</b> from activities such as infected carcass burial or the dispersion of effluents from slaughter houses, or by <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>pastures</b> by infected animals, (e. g. scrapie in sheep). Knowledge of the fate of prion proteins in soils, and associated physico-chemical conditions which favour migration, can be used to help prevent re-infection of animals through grazing, to protect watercourses and develop good management practices. In two consecutive experiments of 9 and 6 months, the migration of recombinant ovine PrP (recPrP) in soil columns was followed under contrasting levels of microbial activity (normal versus reduced), under varying regimes of soil water content and redox potential, and in two different soil types (loamy sand and clay loam). At each analysis time (1, 3, 6 or 9 months), in both soil types, full-length recPrP was detected in the original contaminated layer, indicating the resilience and stability of recPrP under varied soil conditions, even in the presence of active soil microbial populations. Evidence of protein migration was found in every soil column at the earliest analysis time (1 or 3 months), but was restricted to a maximum distance of 1 cm, indicative of limited initial mobility in soils followed by strong adsorption over the following days to weeks. The survival of recPrP in the soil over a period of at least 9 months was demonstrated. In this study, recPrP was used as an indicator for potential TSE infectivity, although infectivity tests should be carried out before conclusions can be drawn regarding the infection risk posed by prions in soil. However, it has been demonstrated that soil is likely to act as a significant barrier to the dispersion of contaminated material at storage or burial sites. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The disease exhibited marked spatial and temporal clustering and was continuously present in the population for the whole period. The disease had a relatively long duration of up to 22 months and four distinct stages were demonstrated in cross-sectional studies. Among tuberculous possums, prevalences of up to 0. 15 (± 0. 11) were recorded {{in the first stage}} prior to development of gross lesions. After dissemination started, the disease showed rapid generalisation to multiple sites by haematogenous and/or lymphatic spread to the next stage when gross lesions were evident, particularly in lung, axillary and inguinal lymphocentres. In the third stage, lesions were disseminated through almost all lung lobes, discharging fistulae were common and kidney, intestine and mammary gland were commonly affected by both gross and microscopic lesions. Behaviour and outward signs of health were unaffected prior to the terminally-ill stage, lasting for up to 2 months. In common with other marsupials studied to date and in contrast with most eutherians, there are no popliteal lymph nodes and efferent drainage from the inguinal lymphocentre passes directly to the deep axillary group of lymph nodes via an inguinoaxillary trunk. All subcutaneous lymph drainage passes through either the superficial cervical or the axillary lymphocentres before entering the venous system. Studies of survival of Mycobacterium bovis organisms in different natural habitats showed {{a relatively short period of}} survival of M. bovis outside hosts and support a conclusion that environmental <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>pasture,</b> particularly in summer months, may be relatively unimportant in the epidemiology of tuberculosis in cattle, deer and possums. The weight of evidence favours transmission of infection by the respiratory route and it would seem that transmission of tuberculosis between possums occurs through two major and one minor pathway. The first major pathway is pseudo-vertical transmission from mother to joey during the rearing process. The second major transmission mechanism is direct horizontal transmission among adult possums with available evidence suggesting that this takes place around the locality where a possum dens, probably during competition and threat/agonistic behaviour and during courting and mating activity. The third and probably least important pathway is indirect transmission among mature possums. None of three ELISA assays reliably detected possums infected with tuberculosis and poor test performance was exacerbated by inconsistency between results from serially collected samples from known tuberculous possums...|$|E

Results from the grazing trial on semi-natural pastures showed that nematode egg <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> <b>pastures</b> by lightly infected animals {{during the first half}} of the season was sufficient to induce PGE the following spring. The rotation group suffered a weight gain penalty of the same magnitude as the untreated cattle (30 kg), compared with the bolus treated animals.

These programs have evolved considerably over the past 10 to 15 years in North America. In the past only a few animals, other than those suffering from clinical parasitism, were treated.

Lamb weight gain from March until mid-July was 0. 48 lb/head/day. From mid-July until September when the study terminated, lamb weight gain declined (- 0. 03 to 0. 28 lb/head/day). Parasite burdens were low to moderate early in the grazing period, but increased markedly during the mid-July to September period, despite monthly deworming of the flock. It appeared that parasite burdens, high summer temperatures and the lack of shade, and possibly low cobalt and selenium levels were responsible for the late summer decline in weight gain. Evaluation of control measures indicated that intensive deworming prior to parturition eliminated arrested or inhibited larvae in the ewes. The periparturient relaxation of resistance, however, permitted development of infective larvae acquired from the pre- and post-lambing <b>pastures.</b> Maturation <b>of</b> these larvae caused a marked rise in post-parturient egg per gram counts of the ewes with subsequent relatively high rates <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> <b>contamination.</b> Monthly deworming <b>of</b> the flock was moderately effective in reducing parasite burdens and <b>pasture</b> <b>contamination.</b> Alternate grazing <b>of</b> <b>pastures</b> by cattle and sheep, and ad lib. feeding of phenothiazine in salt were not effective as control measures...|$|R
40|$|Parasite {{control in}} wild {{ruminants}} is based mainly on anthelmintics. The {{objective of the}} present study was to evaluate three parasite control programs in seven herds of captive wild ruminants in 3 consecutive years. In the first year, a biannual spring-summer treatment regime with fenbendazole at 7. 5 mg/kg body weight p. o. for 3 days was applied. The next year, an early-season treatment program with three administrations of fenbendazole at the same dosage at 3 -wk intervals was used. In the third year, an early-season treatment program with ivermectin (0. 2 mg/kg p. o. for 3 days), applied three times at 5 -wk intervals, was evaluated. Effectiveness of these control programs was assessed by fecal egg counts and by scores of body condition and fecal consistency at weekly intervals. Involved animal species were Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx), scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), slender-horned gazelle (Gazella leptoceros), Soay sheep (Ovis aries soay), ibex (Capra ibex), red deer (Cervus elaphus hippelaphus), and Nelson's elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni). With the spring-summer regime, fecal egg counts remained low during the first 5 mo, but from September onward, they slowly increased to significant levels in all seven herds. The early-season program with fenbendazole resulted in fecal egg counts near zero during the entire year in four herds but a significant egg shedding from August onward was noted in Arabian oryx, scimitar-horned oryx, and Soay sheep. The early-season program with ivermectin resulted in very low to zero egg shedding in gazelle, adult Soay sheep, ibex, red deer, and Nelson's elk during the entire grazing season, but failed to prevent high shedding in October in Arabian oryx and scimitar-horned oryx.

40|$|Populations of European {{starlings}} {{have declined}} over {{large parts of}} northern and western Europe during the last 20 years. It {{has been suggested that}} reduced availability <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> in the agricultural landscape was one reason for this decline. To investigate this, breeding colonies for starlings were established in southern Sweden, in agricultural landscapes with different availabilities <b>of</b> <b>pasture.</b> Agricultural land-use was classified in a circular area of 500 m around each colony. Production of young per nest was positively related to the availability <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> close to the breeding colony, not because the availability <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> affected clutch size or hatchability of eggs, but because nestling survival was higher in colonies surrounded by pasture. The growth rate of an offspring feather character, but not offspring final mass or tarsus length, tended {{to be related to the}} availability <b>of</b> <b>pasture.</b> When availability <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> was low, the variability of breeding success between years was high. Breeding density was also positively related to the availability <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> near colonies. The combined trends in reproductive success and breeding density in this study support the contention that the reduction <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> in modern agricultural landscape may be one reason why starling population size has declined...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} analysis of input parameters for a dynamic food chain model DYNACON was performed {{as a function}} of deposition time for the long-lived radionuclides (137 Cs, 90 Sr) and the selected foodstuffs (cereals, milk). The influence of input parameters for short and long-term <b>contaminations</b> <b>of</b> the foodstuffs after a deposition was also investigated. The input parameters were sampled using a Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) technique, and their sensitivity indices were quantified as partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC). PRCCs were strongly dependent on the <b>contamination</b> period <b>of</b> foodstuffs as well as the deposition time of radionuclides. In case of deposition during growing stage of agricultural plants, the input parameters associated with contamination by foliar absorption were relatively influential in long-term contamination as well as short-term contamination. They were also influential in short-term <b>contamination</b> in case <b>of</b> deposition during non-growing stage. As the contamination period is longer, the influence of parameters associated with contamination by root uptake was increased. This phenomenon was more remarkable in case of the deposition during non-growing stage than growing stage, and in case of 90 Sr deposition than 137 Cs deposition. In case of deposition during growing stage <b>of</b> <b>pasture,</b> the characteristic parameters of cattle such as feed-milk transfer factor and daily intake rate were relatively influential in the <b>contamination</b> <b>of</b> milk...|$|R

40|$|The {{sustainable}} use <b>of</b> <b>pastures</b> is <b>of</b> fundamental importance, given that a considerable part <b>of</b> the Brazilian <b>pastures</b> {{may be in}} process of degradation or degraded (Andrade et al., 2016). In general, the use <b>of</b> <b>pastures</b> is characterized by extractivism, with few producers who invest in {{the recovery of the}} productive potential <b>of</b> <b>pastures</b> and adopting less impactful technologies to the environment. Thus, the intensification of pastoral production systems can be adopted as a viable option to minimize the pressure on opening new areas of agricultural production and reduce the emission of gases causing the greenhouse effect (Barcellos et al., 2008).
