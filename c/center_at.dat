30|$|We {{have already}} {{investigated}} kinetics of hydrothermally induced reorganization of J-aggregate in the mixed MS-C 20 LB system and {{have pointed out}} that the UV-visible absorption spectra can be deconvoluted to three components: Band I (<b>centered</b> <b>at</b> 500 to 515 nm), Band II (<b>centered</b> <b>at</b> 545 to 555 nm), and Band III (<b>centered</b> <b>at</b> 590 to 598 nm) [17, 19, 22, 26]. Band I, Band II, and Band III are assigned as the blue-shifted dimer, monomer, and red-shifted J-aggregate, respectively. Furthermore, the HTT process consists of following two stages. The first stage is characterized by the decrease in the Band III component associated with the increase in the Band I component, which is hypothesized as a dissociation process of the original J-aggregate (Band III <b>centered</b> <b>at</b> 590 nm) to the blue-shifted dimer (<b>centered</b> <b>at</b> 500 to 515 nm). The second stage is characterized as the reorganization of Band III (<b>centered</b> <b>at</b> 597 to 599 nm) from Band I (500 to 515 nm). Since the component of Band II (<b>centered</b> <b>at</b> 545 to 555 nm) is almost unchanged throughout the whole HTT process, we have described that the growth and decay processes in the second stage are assumed to be a first-order reaction between Band I and Band III components [22, 26].|$|R
