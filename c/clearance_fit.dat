40|$|Polygonal shafts {{are a major}} {{competitor}} {{to spline}} and keyed shafts for power transmission due to features as self-centering, lack of stress concentration area, and ease of assembly and disassembly. Past studies on polygonal profiles have focused on a single profile and comparisons based on nominal sizes of three and four lobe profiles. This research explores the loading strength of the standardized three and four lobe polygonal shafts and hubs manufactured from the same stock size, subjected to pure torsional and torsional bending load from a spur gear of 20 ° pressure angle at various fits. In absence of analytical solution, Finite element method has been used after verifying the results experimentally, theoretically, and DIN standard. From the finite element analysis, the hub was found to experience greater stress than the shaft in all cases. The <b>clearance</b> <b>fit</b> {{was found to be}} the most critical connection and interference fit to be the most suitable for larger power transmission. The P 4 C connection had greater stress, especially in the hub, than the P 3 G connection. The difference between the P 4 C shaft and the P 3 G shaft was 4. 05 % in the interference fit and 60. 6 % in the <b>clearance</b> <b>fit,</b> suggesting P 4 C <b>clearance</b> <b>fit</b> to be less favorable for larger power transmission. Owing to its small normal axial stress, the P 4 C <b>clearance</b> <b>fit</b> has its use in low power transmission where sliding fit is a requirement. The reason for greater stress in P 4 C shaft and hub connection is due to the large pressure angle at the point of contact, which leads to a smaller contact area and greater contact pressure.

The P 3 G and P 4 C shaft and hub have been compared for interference, line to line and <b>clearance</b> <b>fit.</b> The conformal contact between the shaft and the hub in polygonal profile makes it difficult to design them analytically. With the advancement of numerical analysis as Finite Element Analysis, these issues can be addressed, making polygonal shafts a viable competitor to keyed and splined shafts.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{tangential}} friction at pin—hole interfaces are appropriately modelled {{for the analysis}} of fasteners in large composite (orthotropic) plate loaded along its edges. The pin—hole contact could be of interference, <b>clearance</b> or neat <b>fit.</b> When the plate load is monotonically increased, interference fits give rise to receding contact, whereas <b>clearance</b> <b>fits</b> result in advancing contact. In either case, the changing contact situations lead to non-linear moving boundary value problems. The neat fit comes out as a special case in which the contact and separation regions are invariant with the applied load level and so the problem remains linear. The description of boundary conditions in the presence of tangential friction, will depend on whether the problem is one of advancing or receding contact, advancing contact presenting a special problem. A model is developed for the limiting case of a rigid pin and an ideally rough interface (infinitely large friction coefficient). The non-linearity resulting from the continuously varying proportions of contact and separation at the interface, is handled by an “Inverse Formulation” which was successfully applied earlier by the authors for smooth (zero friction) interfacial conditions. The additional difficulty introduced by advancing contact is handled by adopting a “Marching Solution”. The modelling and the procedure are illustrated in respect of symmetric plate load cases. Numerical results are presented bringing out the effects of interfacial friction and plate orthotropy on load-contact relations and plate stresses...|$|R
40|$|The plane {{problem of}} load {{transfer}} from an elastic interference or <b>clearance</b> <b>fit</b> pin {{to a large}} elastic sheet with a perfectly smooth interface is solved. As the load on the pin is monotonically increased, the pin-hole interface is in partial contact above certain critical load in interference fit and throughout the loading range in <b>clearance</b> <b>fit.</b> Such situations result in mixed boundary-value problems with moving boundaries and the arc of contact varies nonlinearly with applied load. These problems are analyzed by an inverse technique in which the arcs of contact/separation are prescribed and the causative loads are evaluated. A direct method of analysis is adopted using biharmonic polar trigonometric stress functions and a simple collocation method for satisfying the boundary conditions. A unified analytical formulation is achieved for interference and clearance fits. The solutions for the linear problem of push fits are inherent in the unified analysis.

40|$|Effects of {{fastener}} <b>clearance</b> <b>fit,</b> friction coefficient, and corrosion pillowing on {{the stress}} state in triple-row riveted lap joints were studied numerically using three-dimensional finite element methods. The material elastoplastic constitutive relationship and geometric nonlinear properties, {{as well as}} nonlinear contact boundary conditions, {{were included in the}} numerical simulations. The numerical modeling was validated using experimental measurements of the rivet driven head deformation and in-situ strains. The lap joints were loaded in tension after riveting. Three different clearance fits, three different friction coefficients, and four corrosion pillowing conditions were analyzed. The stress variation along prescribed paths during the tensile loading stage is discussed for each of these conditions. Full-field contours of the friction and maximum principal stresses during the tensile loading stage were investigated. Numerical results showed that a small increase in the <b>clearance</b> <b>fit</b> considerably increased the joint stress magnitude. The <b>clearance</b> <b>fit</b> magnitude also affected the maximum stress location in the vicinity at the top fastener hole. A large friction coefficient increased the contact and friction stresses in the hole vicinity. These results could explain the scatter degree of the fatigue data and could be used to improve the manufacture quality for high fatigue-rated riveted lap joints. Serious corrosion pillowing significantly increased the stress magnitude at both the middle and top hole regions, and led to the co-existence of the two highly-stressed areas in the outer sheet, which greatly decreased the integrity of the aged riveted lap joint due to the occurrence of the multiple-sited damages during cyclic loading.

40|$|BS 1916 {{limits and}} fits for {{engineering}} {{is based on}} ISA bulletin 25 which was first issued in 1921 and designed for use with the metric system. It provides {{a wide range of}} tolerances for holes and shafts from which it is possible by suitable selection to satisfy a wide range of engineering requirements. The basic principle underlying the system is the allocation of letters to signify the magnitude of the displacement of that part of the tolerance zone which is nearest to the basic size and a number to indicate the magnitude of the tolerance. Capital letters are used for holes, small letters for shafts. The numbers referred to as fundamental tolerances are common to holes and shafts. In applying the system to inch sizes care was taken to ensure that fit combinations (H 6 /k 4) would provide the same type of fit in the inch system as was established in the metric system throughout the whole of the Size range. It was also recommended that a unilateral hole basis be adopted in which the hole is the standard member and the tolerance specified as a value from nominal to plus an amount determined. by the number signifying the magnitude of the tolerance. Different types of fit are obtained by selecting from the standard shafts available the one whose fundamental deviation from basic size is considered to be the most suitable and :allocating to it a suitable standard tolerance When ISA bulletin 25 was issued great care was taken in selecting the disposition of the sizes allocated to standard shafts so that when one standard shaft was used with one standard hole it would provide a fit which -mould be functionally similar throughout the complete range of sizes. The decision of I. S. O. and B. S. I. to extend the size range from 20 inches to 200 inches caused reasonable doubts to exist about the reliability of this simple rule that one fit combination would be functionally similar throughout the whole of the extended size range.
