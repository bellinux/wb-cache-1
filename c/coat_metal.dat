50|$|Recent {{advances}} {{have been made}} in ceramics which include bioceramics, such as dental implants and synthetic bones. Hydroxyapatite, the natural mineral component of bone, has been made synthetically from a number of biological and chemical sources and can be formed into ceramic materials. Orthopedic implants coated with these materials bond readily to bone and other tissues in the body without rejection or inflammatory reactions so are of great interest for gene delivery and tissue engineering scaffolds. Most hydroxyapatite ceramics are very porous and lack mechanical strength, and are used to <b>coat</b> <b>metal</b> orthopedic devices to aid in forming a bond to bone or as bone fillers. They are also used as fillers for orthopedic plastic screws to aid in reducing the inflammation and increase absorption of these plastic materials. Work is being done to make strong, fully dense nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite ceramic materials for orthopedic weight bearing devices, replacing foreign metal and plastic orthopedic materials with a synthetic, but naturally occurring, bone mineral. Ultimately, these ceramic materials may be used as bone replacements or with the incorporation of protein collagens, synthetic bones.|$|E
50|$|Another {{expression}} of Chicano identity through their art is their depictions {{of life in}} the barrio - Spanish-speaking, Latino neighborhoods in a city or town. Often the barrios, as ethnic enclaves, have long histories of dislocation, marginalization, poverty, and inequity in access social services. In the United States, barrios can also refer to the geographical “turf” claimed by Latino gangs, most commonly limited to Chicano gangs in California. However, it was in these barrios that the most interesting forms of art were made by the Chicano community, particularly lowrider cars and bicycles, and graffiti.A very popular style of car, even to this day, emerged from Chicano barrios, known as a “Lowrider.” A lowrider is a style of car that sits lower to the ground than most other cars. Many lowriders have their suspension systems modified with hydraulic suspension so that the car can change height at the flip of a switch. Lowriding originated in the 1930s and blossomed in Southwestern Chicano communities during the post-war prosperity of the ‘50s. Initially, youth who were dressed in the “pachuco” style would place sandbags in the trunk of their customized cars {{in order to create a}} lowered effect. However, this method was quickly replaced by lowering blocks, cut spring coils, z’ed frames and drop spindles. The go al was to cruise as slowly as possible so that people could see what types of customizations were done to your car. Lowrider customizations consist of sun visors, fender skirts, bug deflectors, and swamp coolers. Expensive custom paint jobs are also common such as metal oxide flake or pearl flake, clear <b>coat,</b> <b>metal</b> leaf, airbrushed murals or script, pinstripes, and flames. Gold or chrome spoke wheels or rims such as Astro Supremes, Cragers, Tru spokes, Crowns, Daytons and Zeniths are also common. Many cars have the modification of having suicide doors, or doors which open in the opposite direction to a standard car door, scissor doors that open vertically, or gull-wing doors that open towards the roof, swinging up. Since the early 1990s, lowriders have become common in urban youth culture in general, primarily in West Coast hip hop. The lowriding scene is diverse including many different cultures, vehicle makes and visual styles, however it remains an important part of the Chicano community and identity.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{imidazole}} ring is {{ubiquitous in}} nature and imidazole functionality plays {{a critical role in}} many structures within the human body, notably as histamine and histadine. Imidazoles offer many biophysical interactions including their ability to hydrogen bond with drugs and proteins. In contrast, imidazolium salts have lost their strong hydrogen-bonding ability through alkylation of both nitrogens, but they are able to aggregate electrostatically. Imidazolium salts are used to extract metal ions from aqueous solutions, dissolve carbohydrates, create polyelectrolyte brushes on surfaces, <b>coat</b> <b>metal</b> nanoparticles, provide antimicrobial action, and create oriented liquid crystals. Bioactive applications include imidazolium hydrogels, antiarrhythmics, and anti-metastic agents. This review will describe the synthesis and design of imidazole derivatives and imidazolium-containing polymers as bioactive materials. Imidazole-based polymers readily associate with biological molecules through hydrogen-bonding, and imidazolium analogs offer electrostatic interactions, aggregation, and self-assembly.

Analysis of {{retrieved}} tissues associated with failed implants, suggest that phagocytosis of HA wear debris by monocytes/macrophages might provide a potent stimulus for the release of a variety of cytokines. Phagocytosis involved a large variety of cellular receptors like toll-like receptors that results in activation of the transcriptional nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) via a cell-signalling pathway. In the present paper, we aimed to evaluate the role of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) in the production of inflammatory cytokines induced by HA particles using TLR 4 (+) and TLR 4 (-) peritoneal macrophages. We investigated the production of TNF-alpha and the activation of the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB.

The hydrophilic graft copolymer Soluplus® {{was used as a}} drug carrier and the coating formulations consisted of drug–polymer solutions at various ratios. A piezoelectric dispenser jetted microdroplets on the microneedle surface to develop uniform, accurate and reproducible coating layers without any material losses. Inkjet printing was found to depend on the nozzle size, the applied voltage (mV) and the duration of the pulse (μs). The drug release rates were determined in vitro using Franz type diffusion cells with dermatomed porcine skin. The drug release rates depended on the drug–polymer ratio, the drug lipophilicity and the skin thickness. All drugs presented increased release profiles (750 μm skin thickness), which were retarded for 900 μm skin thickness. Soluplus assisted the drug release especially for the water insoluble curcumin and cisplatin due to its solubilizing capacity.

Moreover, recent advances in stem cell technologyand especially {{in the field of}} diabetes call for non-invasive approaches in quality testing of the large quantities ofsurrogate pancreatic islets to be generated. Electrical activity of such a micro-organ results in single cell actionpotentials (APs) of high frequency and in low frequency changes in local field potentials (slow potentials or SPs),reflecting coupled cell activity and overall organ physiology. Each of them is indicative of different physiologicalstages in islet activation. Action potentials in islets are of small amplitude and very difficult to detect.

At last, the capability of fluidized bed processing was tested upon built ‘ad hoc’ fatigue samples. The way to rupture of fluidized bed treated and untreated samples was also discussed. At any rate, the fatigue behaviour of processed components was found significantly improved.

Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly allows for the incorporation {{of a wide range of}} functional materials into structured thin films based on the alternate adsorption of cationic and anionic species. Biomolecules, and in particular viruses, show great potential as components of functional materials due to their capacity for molecular recognition and self-assembly. Here we report that by substituting a negatively charged variant of M 13 bacteriophage for the negatively charged polymer during the dip LbL assembly process, phage can be incorporated into a hybrid material with characteristics of both its biological and polymeric components. The resulting mesoporous polymer films can be used as a template for the construction of the titania photoanode of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with a novel nanowire architecture to enhance electron transport. The biotemplated nanowires are shown to significantly increase device electron diffusion length and increase device efficiency as compared to LbL-templated titania photoanodes made without bacteriophage. Spray LbL is also investigated as an assembly method for the construction porous templates for titania photoanodes. The necessary porous transition is shown to occur on flat substrates, like those normally utilized for DSSCs, and on porous metal meshes, substrates that have been proposed as lower-cost DSSC current collectors.

40|$|The {{interactions}} of microparticles, particularly those possessing nano- and microstructured asperities, {{play a critical}} role in many industrial applications. As a result, control over particle-particle and particle-surface interactions can be accomplished by designing microparticles with well-defined surface morphologies. Nature provides remarkable examples of evolutionary-optimized microscale biological particles with structures and/or chemistries tailored for effective adhesion to a variety of surfaces under different dynamic and environmental conditions. Prominent among these are pollen, which possess a range of ornamentations consisting of combinations of various morphologies and feature sizes. These surface structures, provided by a highly chemically and mechanically stable outer shell, make pollen a model bioparticle for evaluating geometric effects on adhesion. This research aims to take advantage of pollen's unique architecture by utilizing it as a biotemplate for designing pollen-derived particles with tailorable microparticle adhesion. In this work, the adhesion behavior of pollen and pollen-derived particles is characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Cleaned natural pollen particles were found to exhibit short-range van der Waals (VDW) adhesion strengths that were independent of surface chemistry and scaled with the tip radius of pollen's ornamentations. Employing pollen as a core material, electrostatic interactions were utilized to controllably <b>coat</b> <b>metal</b> nanoparticles onto pollen's surface. Metal nanoparticle-coated pollen particles displayed enhanced adhesion facilitated by multiple nanoparticle contacts with probe surfaces, while also showing potential for use as surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates. Using pollen as a template, a layer-by-layer (LbL) surface sol-gel (SSG) technique allowed for the preparation of high-fidelity ferro- and ferrimagnetic replicas exhibiting short-range VDW-based adhesion governed by the contact of nanocrystals present, and long-range magnetic attraction governed by the magnetic properties of ferrimagnetic pollen replicas.
