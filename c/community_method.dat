25|$|EU as a {{security}} provider: Management of post Soviet-er{{a security}} tensions in bordering States (Ukraine, Georgia and Balkan States) has exposed deep-rooted structural weaknesses of European Union institutions. European Union's collective response on matters ranging from {{the management of the}} exodus of refugees from war-torn Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, participation in NATO-led interventions, action against non-State entities (Islamic State & Al-Qaeda), etc. suffers from differing priorities of 28 European Union member States. The paucity of strategic vision within the European Council, nationality-quota based allotment of senior bureaucratic positions within the Institutions of the European Union, and the capacity of minor European countries to unduly influence policy choices of the European Union is problematic. Decision taking by Brussels-based European stake-holders is cumbersome and severely limited due to intra-EU politics and the obsession with Byzantine <b>Community</b> <b>method</b> consensus-based decision making procedures. The Ukrainian crisis exposed the shortcomings of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and outlined the limits of German military clout. Public disenchantment with the political outcomes of recent military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya has emptied political support for accrued European Union involvement in the Syrian and Ukrainian crisis. Further strengthening of European Union sanctions regime against Russia faces internal dissent from several EU member States (Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Finland) besides being largely ignored by European multinationals (German and Italian companies have most investment exposure in Russia) who bypass the sanctions regime by trading with Russia via third-countries (Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel). A 2015 Pew Research survey indicated that Europeans are by and large not favourable to a military deployment by their country under the terms of NATO Article 5 to protect a fellow member country which comes under attack.|$|E

In the post-de Gaulle period, rather than holding pan-European elections under a single statute as specified in all the treaties, governments held and continue to hold separate national elections for the European Parliament. These often favour the major parties and discriminate against smaller, regional parties. Rather than granting elections to organised civil society in the consultative committees, governments created a three-pillar system under the Amsterdam Treaty and Maastricht Treaty, mixing intergovernmental and supranational systems.

5000|$|The OMC is more {{intergovernmental}} {{in nature}} {{than the traditional}} means of policy-making in the EU, the so-called <b>community</b> <b>method.</b> Because it is a decentralised approach through which agreed policies are largely implemented by the member states and supervised by the Council of the European Union, {{the involvement of the}} European Parliament and the European Court of Justice is very weak indeed. Formally, at least, the European Commission has primarily a monitoring role; in practice, however, there is considerable scope for it to help set the policy agenda and persuade reluctant Member States to implement agreed policies. Although the OMC was devised as a tool in policy areas which remain the responsibility of national governments (and where the EU itself has no, or few, legislative powers) it is sometimes seen as a way for the Commission to [...] "get a foot in the door" [...] of a national policy area.|$|E

Democracy, which he defined as [...] "in the service of the people and acting in agreement with it", was a fundamental part of a supranational community. However, governments only began to hold direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979, and then not according to the treaties. A single electoral statute was specified in the treaty for Europe's first community of coal and steel in 1951. Civil society (largely non-political) was to have its own elected chamber in the Consultative Committees specific to each Community as democratically agreed, but the process was frozen (as were Europe's parliamentary elections) by Charles de Gaulle and other politicians who opposed the <b>Community</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E

The European Council met in Stockholm on 23 and 24 March 2001, and {{in the light of the}} Council's document, asked the Council and Commiussion to report back to the Spring European Council 2002, a year later, giving [...] "a detailed work programme on the follow-up of the objectives of education and training systems, including an assessment of their achievement in the framework of the open method of coordination and in a worldwide perspective; special attention must be given to ways and means of encouraging young people, especially women, in scientific and technical studies as well as ensuring the long-term recruitment of qualified teachers in these fields". The Commission presented a draft work programme in September 2001. This was considerably worked over and a revised version was adopted jointly by the Council and Commission on 14 February 2002. The European Council welcomed the Work Programme, asked the Ministers and the Commission to implement it, and to report back two years later.

5000|$|The French side often {{encountered}} {{resistance to}} their proposals for {{the solution of}} the Ruhr Question. This was especially true {{in the case of the}} British and Americans. The British had pursued their own concept when founding the state of Northrhine-Westphalia by nearly socializing the coal and steel industry. The Americans had operated under the containment of the Truman Doctrine with the objectives of the Marshall Plan. Thus, the Americans refused to dismantle, and defused the socialization plans of the British. The Americans first came up with the concept of a [...] "Ruhr Charter" [...] in 1948, providing for international supervision of and international access to coal and steel products from the Rhine and Ruhr. The Soviets, however, were left out of the American-born [...] "Ruhr Charter" [...] concept, given no access nor oversight. The [...] "Ruhr Charter" [...] was the idea that served as the basis for further discussion among the Western allies. The final resolution of the Ruhr question came with the London 6-Power Conference in 1948. The three western allies and the Benelux countries agreed on the joint development of a concept for an international authority providing international access to the German coal and steel market. The next step was creating a German central government in West Germany in accordance with the Frankfurt Documents. The Ruhr office became official in 1949, setting up the [...] "International Authority for the Ruhr" [...] in Düsseldorf. This agency controlled about 40% of German industrial production. The Parlamentarischer Rat of West Germany rejected the [...] "International Authority for the Ruhr" [...] as discrimination. Karl Arnold, the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, agreed with the other Prime Ministers of the German states to accept the [...] "International Authority for the Ruhr" [...] on the condition that other coal and steel locations in the West of Europe were put under the same control. This condition was not met by the Ruhr statute, but discussions subsequently went in the direction of an economic union of European countries. With the Petersberg Agreement on November 22nd, 1949, the first federal government under Konrad Adenauer accepted the [...] "International Authority for the Ruhr". [...] In December of 1949, West Germany officially gained voting rights in the [...] "International Authority for the Ruhr". This laid the foundations for the Schuman Declaration of 1950, which laid the groundwork for the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951. This French-born idea of the cessation of French territory towards the creation of a [...] "European structure" [...] was previously laid out in a memorandum written by Jean Monnet in Algiers on August 5th, 1943.

40|$|This article {{proceeds}} to a normative {{claim that the}} potential of the European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) – an instrument expected to increase democratic legitimacy in the EU – should be evaluated {{in the light of the}} post-Lisbon <b>Community</b> <b>method</b> and not as an additional ‘opportunity structure for citizens’ participation’.

Furthermore, the legal framework of the ECI (notably the Regulation 211 / 2011 but also the Commission’s Green Paper preceding the adoption of the Regulation) is provided. The evaluation section concludes that the ECI’s legislative framework, far from an instrument of direct democracy, perhaps an additional ‘opportunity structure’, cannot affect the <b>Community</b> <b>method</b> nor seriously increase democratic legitimacy at the EU level due to the – simultaneous – presence of two thresholds: the intactness of the Commission’s legislative monopoly and the burdensome formalities imposed upon citizens and organisers...|$|E
