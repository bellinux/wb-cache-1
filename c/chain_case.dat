5000|$|Early {{models of}} the M42 {{experienced}} failures of a profile gasket sealing the lower cam <b>chain</b> <b>case</b> to {{the underside of the}} cylinder head. [...] This gasket seals the primary coolant passage within the timing <b>chain</b> <b>case.</b> A significant failure would thus discharge pressurized steam and hot coolant into the timing <b>chain</b> <b>case.</b> In many cases this coolant rapidly contaminates the motor oil in the sump, causing main bearing failure. BMW updated the profile gasket material and instituted a program to repair motors under warranty. In extreme cases, the aluminum mating surfaces in the head and <b>chain</b> <b>case</b> would corrode.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} ground state {{localization}} properties of {{an array of}} identical interacting spinless fermionic chains with quasi-random disorder, using non-perturbative Renormalization Group methods. In the single or two <b>chains</b> <b>case</b> localization persists while for {{a larger number of}} chains a different qualitative behavior is generically expected, unless the many body interaction is vanishing. This is due to number theoretical properties of the frequency, similar to the ones assumed in KAM theory, and cancellations due to Pauli principle which in the single or two <b>chains</b> <b>case</b> imply that all the effective interactions are irrelevant; in contrast for a larger number of chains relevant effective interactions are present.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{versions of}} the M42 developed problems with the camshaft chain drive. The hydraulic tensioner, chain guides, idler wheel and rear lower <b>chain</b> <b>case</b> have all been updated to resolve mechanical wear problems experienced in the early {{versions of the}} M42. Since the updated cam chain tensioner is shared with the M44, people commonly refer to the revised tensioner as a [...] "M44 tensioner".|$|E
50|$|The classic Flying Pigeon bicycle is the PA-02, a single-speed with 28-inch wheels, {{mudguards}} (fenders), a {{fully enclosed}} <b>chain</b> <b>case,</b> a rear rack and rod-actuated brakes. The typically available color is black. However other colors are available, such as, dark green, {{which is used}} by China Post; red, which is used by Chinese municipal fire departments; and yellow, orange and blue, which are used by various businesses. Most models are pinstriped.|$|E
5000|$|Predecessors {{were the}} OHV C110/C11/C114 and OHC S50. Produced from 1961 onwards, the Honda 50 Sport (type C110 and C111) {{variant of the}} Super Cub, laid out the basics of all future models: It had a pressed steel frame, {{hydraulic}} front/rear forks, a [...] OHV four-stroke engine. The cylinder was laid horizontally to optimise cooling. The final drive was chain running in an enclosed <b>chain</b> <b>case.</b> The S50 featured an all-new OHC alloy head engine.|$|E

50|$|Most of the {{advantages}} claimed for a shaft drive can be realized by using a fully enclosed <b>chain</b> <b>case.</b> Some of the other issues addressed by the shaft drive, such as protection for clothing and from ingress of dirt, can be met {{through the use of}} chain guards. The reduced need for adjustment in shaft-drive bikes also applies to a similar extent to chain or belt-driven hub-geared bikes. Not all hub gear systems are shaft compatible.|$|E
50|$|In 1959, Ariel {{dropped its}} {{four-stroke}} engines and produced the Ariel Leader, a fully enclosed 250 cc two-stroke with a fully faired {{body from the}} headlamp aft. The Leader aimed to combine {{the benefits of the}} motorcycle with the advantages of a scooter. Ariel also made the Arrow, a more open version of the Leader which kept the Leader's enclosed <b>chain</b> <b>case</b> and deep mudguards. Both models were an unsuccessful attempt to compete with new Japanese imports.|$|E
50|$|A gear case, {{also known}} as a <b>chain</b> <b>case</b> or chainguard, is an {{enclosure}} for the bicycle chain and sprocket assemblages commonly employed by utility bicycles. It serves to protect the cyclist from being soiled or trapped in the chain rings and tends to fully enclose the drive train. It may also contain an oil bath to keep the chain lubricated. Modern examples are usually moulded in plastic. Similar devices may be found in connection with chains used on larger vehicles and machinery.|$|E

50|$|The Mormon sex in <b>chains</b> <b>case</b> was {{a widely}} {{reported}} scandal involving {{a sexual assault}} by an American woman, Joyce McKinney, on a young American male Mormon missionary, Kirk Anderson, in England in 1977. According to Anderson, he had been abducted by McKinney from the steps of a church meetinghouse, chained to a bed and raped by her. Before the case could be tried, McKinney jumped bail and fled to America.|$|R

5000|$|GM used cast {{aluminum}} cylinder heads featuring 4 valves per cylinder. The heads used dual overhead cams driven through the [...] "maintenance-free" [...] cam-drive <b>chain</b> <b>case.</b> The cams act directly on hydraulic lifters {{on the ends}} of the valves and are fed with a lubrication passage drilled through the cylinder head lengthwise. The intake valves are inclined at 25°, while the exhaust valves are canted to 7° with center-mounted platinum-tipped spark plugs. The cam covers are magnesium for light weight and sound damping.|$|E
5000|$|A {{newsreel}} from 1937 {{clearly shows}} a rowed bicycle {{that is very}} similar to today's RowBike. It does not use a bungee cord to maintain tension, instead it has a circular <b>chain</b> <b>case</b> mounted where the derailer normally hangs. The case seems to have a spring mechanism that pulls excess chain links into the case, much the same way the shock cord pulls excess chain into the power lever. Like the first version of the RowBike the chain is connected {{to the end of the}} power lever, and there is no [...] "Dave cam" ...|$|E
50|$|A {{single-sided}} swingarm {{is a type}} of swingarm which lies along only one side of the rear wheel, allowing the rear wheel to be mounted like a car wheel (unlike the conventional motorcycle double-sided swingarm). Single-sided swingarms are traditionally found on small motorcycles or scooters, where a robust <b>chain</b> <b>case</b> doubles as the swingarm linking the engine and rear wheel. Single-sided swingarms need to be much stiffer than the double-sided versions, to accommodate the extra torsional forces, and as a result, they are usually heavier than double-sided arms. Having a single mounting point guarantees proper wheel alignment.|$|E
50|$|The AJS Silver Streak was a British {{motorcycle}} {{launched in}} 1938 and {{described in the}} sales brochure as the 'aristocrats of the motor-cycle world'. Produced {{with a choice of}} 250 cc, 350 cc and 500 cc engines, the Silver Streaks were super sport machines with a special polished finish and hand tuned engines. As many parts as possible were specially chrome plated, including the mudguards, headlamp, fork links, front and rear <b>chain</b> <b>cases,</b> oil and petrol tanks and even the tool-box.|$|R

50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the Venom design is that the clutch was between the gearbox and gearbox {{sprocket}} rather than the conventional configuration in the primary <b>chain</b> <b>case</b> on the far left, with the gearbox sprocket between the clutch and the gearbox. This made the clutch less accessible but allowed for easy gearing changes {{and a range of}} sprockets with different numbers of teeth could be fitted by removing the sprocket cover. The gearbox was also a novel Velocette design with a constant mesh close ratio unit that could be maintained relatively easily while still in place.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2008, Triumph {{announced}} the new Thunderbird, a [...] liquid-cooled parallel-twin cruiser with six gears and belt drive.The Thunderbird {{went on sale}} in June 2009. For the 2009 - 2010 Thunderbird model, Triumph marketed an alternative chromed clutch cover accessory featuring Edward Turner's original 'paper dart' Thunderbird logo and script which harked back to the <b>chain</b> <b>case</b> covers of the later pre-unit Thunderbird as pictured. The black-finished 2011 Thunderbird Storm model with the previously optional 1,700 cc engine fitted as standard also carries the same Thunderbird 'paper dart' logo as standard embossed above the word 'Storm' on the clutch cover.|$|E
50|$|The {{power train}} from the four-speed gearbox {{to the two}} rear wheels was also unusual: fixed to the gearbox output drive was {{something}} called a Hardy disc, which was a cardan joint made of rubber. On {{the other side of}} it was a cardan shaft, and finally a second Hardy disc, which in turn was located at the entrance to a <b>chain</b> <b>case.</b> A duplex chain running in an oil bath led finally to a rigid shaft, at each end of which were the two rear wheels. Thanks to this elaborate power transfer, the engine-gearbox unit was both free of tension and well soundproofed in its linkage to the rear axle.|$|E
50|$|In February 1904 the 12-horsepower car {{was given}} a six-cylinder 16-horsepower stablemate. Like the 12 the new engine was {{designed}} to give its full power at what were even then considered low engine speeds. Particular note was made that special attention had once more been paid to further controlling the airflow beneath the car's apron and the chassis to reduce that bane of passengers' comfort, the car's disturbance of dust on the road. The new car also featured <b>chain</b> <b>cases</b> so the <b>chains</b> ran in oil, were rendered almost silent and were protected from dirt.|$|R
30|$|The study {{employed}} a qualitative case study approach {{to explore the}} factors that attract suppliers {{to be committed to}} long-term supply relationships in agri-food supply chains. In particular where suppliers are require to consistently deliver to high product specifications. An exploratory case study method was used in order to gain insight into the complex factors that contribute to the formation of long-term supply commitments in agri-food supply <b>chains.</b> <b>Case</b> study research can involve single or multiple cases (Yin 2003). A multiple case study approach was used as this provides advantages in identifying patterns and enables the triangulation of the results.|$|R

5000|$|The Featherbed {{frame was}} {{designed}} for Norton by the McCandless brothers and made by the Reynolds company because the Norton works {{did not have the}} necessary welding capacity for its manufacture. [...] The Featherbed frame led to the Model 88 Dominator, also called the Dominator De Luxe, which used the same 497 cc engine and was developed in 1951. Originally developed for export it was sold on the home market from 1953. The 88 suffered from oil leaks from the primary <b>chain</b> <b>case</b> but it was the outdated and inefficient Norton works that resulted in quality control problems for the 200 Model 88's produced each week.|$|E
50|$|To {{capture the}} American market, the 6T Thunderbird used {{a variant of}} the earlier Speed Twin's {{parallel}} twin engine, bored out from 500 cc to 650 cc to give the added horsepower American customers demanded. The concept of enlarging the Speed Twin, the Thunderbird name and its 'paper dart' logo were thought up by managing director Edward Turner on one of his regular trips to Triumph's operations in the USA. The 'paper dart' logo was embossed onto the <b>chain</b> <b>case</b> cover on Thunderbirds from 1955 to 1962 and can be seen upon closer examination on the supplied photograph of the 1962 model. Previously, it appeared as a decal on the headlamp nacelle.|$|E
50|$|The {{top frame}} tube of the Tiger Cub {{was lower than}} normal, leaving the {{headstock}} poorly supported. Some rigidity was recovered by internal bracing of the petrol tank. A plain bearing on the timing side main bearing sometimes wore rapidly. The primary chain ran in a shallow oil-bath but if the level dropped, the chain could suffer lubrication failure and stretch. The chain was not tensioned - and even worse, the primary <b>chain</b> <b>case</b> on early models was a slightly 'waisted' shape. A worn chain could strike both {{the inside of the}} cover and the crankcase itself, making the oil-level even more difficult to maintain in the future. Another common complaint was that the Cub would travel at highway speed (50 mph) for 1/2 hour and then stop unexpectedly. Some attributed this to overheating, but a cure was never found.|$|E
5000|$|The B95 and B105 {{models were}} {{launched}} at the 1959 Geneva Motor Show and boasted more power from twin-cylinder Royal Enfield 692 cc four-stroke engines, with the [...] Super Meteor engine in the B95 and the [...] Constellation {{unit in the}} B105 which could reputedly exceed the magic 100 mi/h km/h. The engines featured Berkeley-design primary <b>chain</b> <b>cases</b> to accommodate a Lucas Bendix starter motor, an external Lucas dynamo mounted above the gearbox, and a duplex (or double-row) chain drive to the differential.
