40|$|Many {{different}} mask patterns can be {{used for}} X-ray backscatter imaging using coded apertures, which can find application in the medical, industrial and security sectors. While some of these patterns may be considered to have a self-supporting structure, {{this is not the case}} for some of the most frequently used patterns such as uniformly redundant arrays or any pattern with a high open fraction. This makes mask construction difficult and usually requires a compromise in its design by drilling holes or adopting a no two holes touching version of the original pattern. In this study, this compromise was avoided by 3 D printing a support structure that was then filled with a radiopaque material to create the completed mask. The coded masks were manufactured using two different methods, hot cast and cold cast. Hot casting involved casting a bismuth alloy at 80 °C into the 3 D printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene mould which produced an absorber with density of 8. 6 g cm- 3. <b>Cold</b> <b>casting</b> was undertaken at room temperature, when a tungsten/epoxy composite was cast into a 3 D printed polylactic acid mould. The cold cast procedure offered a greater density of around 9. 6 to 10 g cm- 3 and consequently greater X-ray attenuation. It was also found to be much easier to manufacture and more cost effective. A critical review of the manufacturing procedure is presented along with some typical images. In both cases the 3 D printing process allowed square apertures to be created avoiding their approximation by circular holes when conventional drilling is used.

500|$|Feminist writer Susan Bordo gave a {{negative}} {{review of the}} video, saying that the leering and pathetic men in the cubicles and Madonna's escape with the boy is [...] "cynically and mechanically tacked on [...] a way of claiming trendy status for what is just cheesecake– or, perhaps, pornography". MTV also had some reservations initially before airing the video, which was later resolved after a meeting with Warner Officials. However socio-critic Mary Harron in her book McRock: Pop as Commodity said that the underlying message in the video is that though Madonna sells sexuality, she is free. There is no overt representation of anything besides friendship with the boy. Their escape together avoids Madonna the sexual overtones {{that would have been}} stronger if she would have escaped with an adult male. This, according to author Richard Dienst, seems to suggest a repudiation of the adult labor of the stage in favor of childhood, androgyny, authenticity and nomadic play. The video is also acclaimed for reviving and re-creating the hard glamor of the studio-era of Hollywood stars and also for representing women as the dominant sex. Author Donn Welton pointed out that the usual power relationship between the [...] "voyeuristic male gaze and object" [...] is destabilized by the portrayal of the male patrons of the peep show as leering and pathetic. At the same time, the portrayal of Madonna as [...] "porno queen object" [...] is deconstructed by the escape {{at the end of the}} video. Maura Johnston from Rolling Stone found influences of the work of Italian film director Federico Fellini and American musical theater chroeographer Bob Fosse. Johnston added, [...] "'Open Your Heart' was gorgeous, from the paintings of art deco artist Tamara de Lempicka on the club exterior, to the colorfully <b>cold</b> <b>cast</b> of characters."

This technique leads to a specific grain structure: horizontal on the wall where nucleation occurs and vertical at the center of the ingot. EBSD analysis along a solidification path shows that successive Sigma 3 twinning is the predominant source of variation in grain orientation. In fact, depending on the location along the solidification path, only 15 - 35 % of grain boundaries are random boundaries without Sigma 3 (n) twinning relationship (1 <= n <= 5) and 34 - 48 % are Sigma 3 twins. The grain orientation distribution is similar at the beginning and end of solidification, and the number of low angle grain boundaries is negligible. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserve...|$|R
