5|$|Sources give differing {{reports of}} what {{happened}} next. Wiesenthal's autobiographies contradict each other on many points; he also over-dramatised and mythologised events. One version has Wiesenthal opening an architectural office and finally being admitted to the Lwów Polytechnic for an advanced degree. He designed a tuberculosis sanatorium, along with some residential buildings {{during the course of}} his studies and was active in a student Zionist organisation. He wrote for the Omnibus, a satirical student newspaper, and graduated in 1939. Author Guy Walters states that Wiesenthal's earliest autobiography does not mention studies at Lwów. Walters quotes a <b>curriculum</b> <b>vitae</b> Wiesenthal prepared after World War II as stating he worked as a supervisor at a factory until 1939 and then worked as a mechanic in a different factory until the Nazis invaded in 1941. Wiesenthal's 1961 book Ich Jagte Eichmann ("I Hunted Eichmann") states that he worked in Odessa as an engineer from 1940 to 1941. Walters says that there is no record of Wiesenthal attending the university at Lwów, and that he does not appear in the Katalog Architektów i Budowniczych (Catalogue of Architects and Builders) for the appropriate period.|$|E

25|$|In Colombia, fully {{licensed}} {{physicians are}} eligible to compete for a spot in a residency program. To be fully licensed, one must first finish a medical training program that usually lasts 5 to 6 years (varies between universities), followed by 1 year of medical and surgical internship. During this internship a national medical qualification exam is required, and, in many cases, an additional year of unsupervised medical practice as a social service physician. Applications are made individually program by program, and are followed by a postgraduate medical qualification exam. The scores during medical studies, university of medical training, <b>curriculum</b> <b>vitae,</b> and, in individual cases, recommendations are also evaluated. The acceptance rate into residencies is very low (~1-5% of applicants in public university programs), physician-resident positions {{do not have a}} salary, and the tuition fees reach or surpass 10,000 USD per year in private universities, and 2,000 USD in public universities. For the reasons mentioned above, many physicians travel abroad (mainly to Argentina, Brazil, Spain and the United States) to seek postgraduate medical training. The duration of the programs varies between 3 and 6 years. In public universities, and some private universities, it is also required to write and defend a medical thesis before receiving a specialist degree.|$|E

40|$|A resume is a concise fact sheet, listing education, experience, accomplishments, and credentials. It is a {{marketing}} tool used to highlight a candidates qualifications {{for a job}} or other opportunity. Contrary to popular belief, a resume will not get a candidate a job; instead, {{it will be one}} of the most valuable tools used to secure an interview. While resumes may differ widely in format and content, there are three basic styles: chronological, functional, and <b>curriculum</b> <b>vita.</b> This guide includes examples of each style. Keep in mind that each resume will be as unique as the writer’s skills and experience. As a result individuals may combine elements of the different resume styles to meet their specific needs. Chronological (Traditional) This style lists experience by date (starting with the most recent) and includes responsibilities and accomplishments for each position. Students who have a number of relevant experiences (paid or volunteer) or have worked at any recognizable organizations would be best served by this format. Functional (Skills-based) The functional style is organized by skillsets. These skills are developed through work/internships, class assignments, and extracurricular activities. If a student has limited internship or job experience, this resume style may best demonstrate qualifications. <b>Curriculum</b> <b>Vita</b> (CV...|$|R
