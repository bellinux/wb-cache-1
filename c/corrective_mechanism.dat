40|$|This article {{formally}} {{analyzes the}} various <b>corrective</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{that have been}} proposed and implemented to alleviate underinvestment in electric power generation. It yields three main analytical findings. First, physical capacity certificates markets implemented in the United States restore optimal investment {{if and only if}} they are supplemented with a "no short sale" condition, i. e., producers can not sell more certificates than they have installed capacity. Then, they raise producers’ profits beyond the imperfect competition level. Second, financial reliability options, proposed in many markets, are effective at curbing market power, although they fail to fully restore investment incentives. If "no short sale" conditions are added, both physical capacity certificates and financial reliability options are equivalent. Finally, a single market for energy and operating reserves subject to a price cap is isomorphic to a simple energy market. Standard peak-load pricing analysis applies: under-investment occurs, unless production is perfectly competitive and the cap is never binding. This analysis highlight the limitations of the <b>corrective</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This suggest that policy makers should first and foremost control and reduce the exercise of market power, then use these mechanisms as interim remedial measures. ...|$|R

40|$|Adaptive optics (AO) is a {{technique}} for correcting aberrations introduced when light propagates through a medium, for example, the light from stars propagating through the turbulent atmosphere. The components of an AO instrument are: (1) a camera to record the aberrations, (2) a <b>corrective</b> <b>mechanism</b> to correct them, (3) a real-time controller (RTC) that processes the camera images and steers the <b>corrective</b> <b>mechanism</b> on milliseconds timescales. We have accelerated the image processing for the AO RTC {{with the use of}} graphics processing units (GPUs). It is crucial that the image is processed before the atmospheric turbulence has changed, i. e., in one or two milliseconds. The main task is to transfer the images to the GPU memory with a minimum delay. The key result of this paper is a demonstration that this can be done fast enough using commercial frame grabbers and standard CUDA tools. Our benchmarking image consists of 1. 6 × 1061. 6 × 106 pixels out of which 1. 2 × 1061. 2 × 106 are used in processing. The images are characterized and reduced into a set of 9248 numbers; about one-third of the total processing time is spent on this characterization. This set of numbers is then used to calculate the commands for the corrective system, which takes about two-third of the total time. The processing rate achieved on a single GPU is about 700 frames per second (fps). This increases to 1100 fps (1565 fps) if we use two (four) GPUs.

40|$|The thesis {{studies the}} {{possibilities}} of regional integration in the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The aim is to view {{the viability of the}} integration strategy chosen by SADC. The starting point of the theoretical framework is the traditional theories of economical integration, which do not give much hope for succesful economic integration among developing countries. Certain qualifications have been made to these traditional market integration theories, which would enable their use also in the context of developing countries. Special emphasis is given to an integration strategy called development integration model, because it is the strategy that SADC claims that it is pursuing. The development integration model emphasises the equal distribution of benefits among the members of a regional grouping. This problem can be tackled with so-called <b>corrective</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Establishment of those mechanisms depend largely on the attitude of member countries, and especially on the leading countries that bear the economical burden of the costs. In the empirical analysis it is seen that the current economical situation and trade patterns in Southern Africa do not favour integration according to the traditional models. Most of the economical benefits will concentrate to South Africa when a SADC free trade area will be formed. At the same time the less-developed members of the region could end up economically even worse-off than at the moment. This problem can be solved only with the <b>corrective</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The success of establishing the <b>corrective</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and the whole development integration model depends largely on the future role of South Africa. The theoretical material of the work consists mainly of the traditional integration theories, but also of the more recent studies on the regionalization in Southern Africa mainly by Bertil Odèn. The empirical analysis is mainly based on the official statistics of SADC countries, but also on other academic research and official publications of SADC. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|AbstractThe {{catalytic}} {{competence of}} gramicidin S synthetase 2 (GS 2) {{was determined by}} following the kinetics of PPi generation using active site titration measurements with [γ- 32 P]ATP. The initial ‘burst’ of product formation can be correlated to the generation of the aminoacyl adenylate:enzyme complexes at the four amino acid activation domains and the subsequent aminoacylation of carrier domains, followed by a slow linear turnover of substrate due to breakdown of the intermediate. Simultaneous activation of all four amino acid substrates at a saturating concentration displayed a consumption of 8. 3 ATP/GS 2. In the presence of single amino acids, a binding stoichiometry higher than the anticipated two ATP per active site was obtained, implying misactivation at non-cognate domains.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the effects of a plantar pressure-based, tongue-placed tactile biofeedback on postural control mechanisms during quiet standing. To this aim, sixteen young healthy adults were asked to stand as immobile as possible with their eyes closed in two conditions of No-biofeedback and Biofeedback. Centre of foot pressure (CoP) displacements, recorded using a force platform, were used to compute the horizontal displacements of the vertical projection the centre of gravity (CoGh) and those of the difference between the CoP and the vertical projection of the CoG (CoP-CoGv). Altogether, the present findings suggest that the main way the plantar pressure-based, tongue-placed tactile biofeedback improves postural control during quiet standing is via both a reduction of the correction thresholds and an increased efficiency of the <b>corrective</b> <b>mechanism</b> involving the CoGh displacements...|$|E
40|$|Under an Arrowian framework, {{centralized}} {{authority and}} management provides for optimal {{decision making in}} large organizations. However, Kenneth Arrow also recognized that other elements within the organization, beyond the central authority, occasionally may have superior information or decision-making skills. In such cases, such elements may act as a <b>corrective</b> <b>mechanism</b> within the organization. In the context of public companies, this Article finds that such a <b>corrective</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{comes in the form}} of hedge fund activism, or, more accurately, offensive shareholder activism. Offensive shareholder activism operates in the market for corporate influence, not control. Consistent with a theoretical framework that protects the value of centralized authority and a legal framework that rests fiduciary responsibility with the board, authority is not shifted to influential, yet unaccountable, shareholders. Governance entrepreneurs in the market for corporate influence must first identify those instances in which authority-sharing may result in value-enhancing policy decisions, and then persuade the board and/or other shareholders of the wisdom of their policies, before they will be permitted to share the authority necessary to implement the policy. Thus, boards often reward offensive shareholder activists that prove to have superior information and/or strategies by at least temporarily sharing authority with the activists by either providing them seats in the board or simply allowing them to directly influence corporate policy. This Article thus reframes the ongoing debate on the value of shareholder activism by showing how offensive shareholder activism can co-exist with—and indeed, is supported by—Kenneth Arrow’s theory of management centralization, which undergirds the traditional authority model of corporate governance. This Article also provides a much-needed bridge between the traditional authority model of corporate law and governance as utilized by Professors Steven Bainbridge and Michael Dooley and those who have done empirical studies on hedge fund activism, including Professor Lucian Bebchuk. This bridge helps to identify when shareholder activism may be a positive influence on corporate governance...|$|E

40|$|SummaryMedial entorhinal grid cells fire in periodic, hexagonally {{patterned}} {{locations and}} are proposed to support path-integration-based navigation. The recursive nature of path integration results in accumulating error and, without a <b>corrective</b> <b>mechanism,</b> {{a breakdown in}} the calculation of location. The observed long-term stability of grid patterns necessitates that the system either performs highly precise internal path integration or implements an external landmark-based error correction mechanism. To distinguish these possibilities, we examined grid cells in behaving rodents as they made long trajectories across an open arena. We found that error accumulates relative to time and distance traveled since the animal last encountered a boundary. This error reflects coherent drift in the grid pattern. Further, interactions with boundaries yield direction-dependent error correction, suggesting that border cells serve as a neural substrate for error correction. These observations, combined with simulations of an attractor network grid cell model, demonstrate that landmarks are crucial to grid stability...|$|E

40|$|International audience—Cloud {{computing}} and Internet of Things (IoT) represent {{two different}} {{technologies that are}} massively being adopted in our daily life, playing {{a fundamental role in}} the future Internet. One important challenge that need to be handled is the enormous amount of data generated by sensing devices, that make the control of sending useless data very important.

5000|$|Signal {{transduction}} mechanisms: {{these are}} molecular processes that commence after {{the interaction of}} the drug with the receptor. For example, it is known that hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) in an organism produces a release of catecholamines, which trigger compensation mechanisms thereby increasing blood glucose levels. The release of catecholamines also triggers a series of symptoms, which allows the organism to recognise what is happening and which act as a stimulant for preventative action (eating sugars). Should a patient be taking a drug such as insulin, which reduces glycaemia, and also be taking another drug such as certain beta-blockers for heart disease, then the beta-blockers will act to block the adrenaline receptors. This will block the reaction triggered by the catecholamines should a hypoglycaemic episode occur.

40|$|This paper {{critically}} analyses {{the impact}} of the institutional set up of UK and US patent systems on the optimality of patent law.

In an analysis that puts temporality {{at the heart of the}} argument, this paper shows how the interactions between key institutions in the patent system can result in doctrinal incoherence. Prominent sources of increasing returns in the patent system are inter-institutional linkages, legal authority exercised by prominent institutions and the intrinsic and extrinsic uncertainty associated with patents. The inadequacy of <b>corrective</b> <b>mechanisms</b> intensifies increasing returns. In such circumstances even early or tentative commitments made to policies and legal standards become tenacious while the costs of policy reversal grow and grow and become prohibitive.

40|$|A common {{feature of}} recent growth models is the {{existence}} of externalities associated with human capital. Each worker, in choosing his level of schooling or occupation, ignores the impact of his choie on future generations. Thus, in general, the level of investment in human capital is suboptimal. One possible <b>corrective</b> <b>mechanism</b> is to reward investment in human capital with social status. As recognized by sociologists, the occupational social status {{is an important factor}} in occupational choice. The paper investigates the implications of social rewards onthe edistribution of talents in society and consequently on the process of economic growth. We consider two sources of heterogeneity among workers: non wage income and ability. We find that the thrive for status may be counter productive, inducing an inefficient allocation of talent. A greater emphasis on status may induce the "wrong" individuals i. e. those with low ability and high wealth to acquire schooling, causing workers with high ability but low wealth to leave the growth enhancing occupations. This crowding ou;effect, taken alone, discourages growth. In general, growth may be enhanced by an increase in the number of workers who invest in education. However, the inefficiency in the allocation of talent persists. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — With {{the advent}} of {{sophisticated}} networking technologies and the related applications, more and more computers are getting hooked to the Internet. This is mainly for utilizing several services ranging from information sharing to electronic transactions. P 2 P networks which allow decentralized systems, have posed problems related to trust when transactions have to be carried out. Current literature proposes several solutions for trust management and reputation computation. The solutions base their assessment of reputations {{on the number of}} successful transactions or on the similarity of the feedbacks. There are some concerns in the feedback ratings if we are not considering the issues like number of transactions, frequency of transactions with the same peer and different peers, age of transaction, how frequently a given peer attends a common vendor, and the number of common vendors between the pairs. This paper puts forward a reputation computation system addressing these concerns. It implicitly allows detection of malicious peers. It also incorporates a <b>corrective</b> <b>mechanism,</b> if the feedbacks are from more number of malicious peers.

A second major conclusion is that powerful <b>corrective</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are at work to keep corporate financial positions from becoming too risky.

Third, the effects on business financing of the tax system, inflation and business risk are difficult to trace in the aggregate data, and these effects may be less straightforward than has commonly been thought. Finally, it is argued that the degree of economic instability and the relative level of federal government borrowing will be key determinants of future corporate financing patterns. ...|$|R

40|$|Expert {{performance}} in music or sport requires {{the ability to}} monitor on-going behavior, detect errors in advance, and modify the performance accordingly. In this context, errors have dramatic consequences, such as playing the wrong note in a piano concert or mis-hitting a smash during a tennis match.
