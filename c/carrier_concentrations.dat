25|$|Charge flow in a BJT {{is due to}} {{diffusion}} of charge carriers across a junction between two regions of different charge concentrations. The regions of a BJT are called emitter, collector, and base. A discrete transistor has three leads for connection to these regions. Typically, the emitter region is heavily doped {{compared to the other}} two layers, whereas the majority charge <b>carrier</b> <b>concentrations</b> in base and collector layers are about the same. By design, most of the BJT collector current is due to the flow of charges injected from a high-concentration emitter into the base where they are minority carriers that diffuse toward the collector, and so BJTs are classified as minority-carrier devices.|$|E

30|$|The {{electrical}} and Hall effect measurements reveal that all Zn 3 N 2 samples grown at different N 2 /Ar ratios have n-type conductivity. The <b>carrier</b> <b>concentration</b> {{of the films}} increases {{with the increase in}} N 2 flow rate during the deposition from ~ 1018 to 1021  cm− 3. A summary of the <b>carrier</b> <b>concentration</b> and Hall mobility of the grown samples is shown in Table 2. The highest Hall mobility and <b>carrier</b> <b>concentration</b> were found for the sample grown at N 2 /Ar ratio of 0.60. By further increasing the N 2 /Ar ratio, the <b>carrier</b> <b>concentration</b> slightly reduces but the Hall mobility is reduced 300 %.

Higher N 2 /Ar gas flow rate ratio results in higher chamber pressure during the growth and that would reduce the mean free path of the sputtering species which in this case is zinc.

50|$|The insulating/semiconducting states {{differ from}} the semimetallic/metallic states in the {{temperature}} dependency of their electrical conductivity. With a metal (which has only one type of charge carrier - electrons), the conductivity decreases with increases in temperature (due to increasing interaction of electrons with phonons (lattice vibrations)). With an insulator or semiconductor (which have two types of charge carriers - holes and electrons), both the carrier mobilities and <b>carrier</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{will contribute to the}} conductivity and these have different temperature dependencies. Ultimately, it is observed that the conductivity of insulators and semiconductors increase with initial increases in temperature above absolute zero (as more electrons are shifted to the conduction band), before decreasing with intermediate temperatures and then, once again, increasing with still higher temperatures. The semimetallic state is similar to the metallic state but in semimetals both holes and electrons contribute to electrical conduction. With some semimetals, like arsenic and antimony, there is a temperature-independent carrier density below room temperature (as in metals) while, in bismuth, this is true at very low temperatures but at higher temperatures the carrier density increases with temperature giving rise to a semimetal-semiconductor transition. A semimetal also differs from an insulator or semiconductor in that a semimetal's conductivity is always non-zero, whereas a semiconductor has zero conductivity at zero temperature and insulators have zero conductivity even at ambient temperatures (due to a wider band gap).|$|E
