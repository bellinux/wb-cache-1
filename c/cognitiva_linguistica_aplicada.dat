40|$|In this paper, I look {{at three}} polemical issues in Applied Linguistics. I argue, first of all, that {{the desire for}} a stable {{definition}} of applied linguistics has by no means prevented research in the discipline. Secondly, I contend that the notion or "tradition" of "linguistics applied" (corpus linguistics or lexicography) is broader and more serious than "applicationism" (the use of linguistic formalisms, artificial practices, and terminology) in teaching material that are problematic and motivated by commercial interests. Thirdly, I argue that Educational Linguistics and Applied Linguistics have overlapping research objectives. In {{the course of the}} paper, I present some reservations about Educational Linguistics.

Nesse sentido, seguimos Fowler (1991), que se confessa essencialmente eclético em relação à sua atitude aos instrumentos de análise, mas que, aponta como o melhor modelo para examinar a conexão entre estrutura lingüística e valores sociais, o modelo funcional desenvolvido por Halliday e seus pesquisadores.

The second aim is to compare participants' statements about their own language proficiency and dominance with data from an oral narrative task in order to investigate whether they accurately predicted their dominant language. The participants performed the task in three languages (English, Spanish and Catalan) and their fluency and lexical richness was analyzed. Overall, fluency measures matched with their perceptions.

The {{purpose of}} the study {{reported}} in the present article is to explore whether differences in second language proficiency and working memory capacity affect the grammatical complexity of second language oral performance. Data from a film retelling task were used to analyze the oral grammatical complexity of a group of 91 L 1 Catalan/Spanish learners of L 2 English from the GRAL group corpus. Syntactic complexity and grammatical variety measures were employed for the analysis. In order to account for text length differences in the narratives, the square root of the denominator was used rather than the denominator itself. Results suggest that, when using this operationalization, both syntactic complexity and grammatical variety measures end up being positively correlated with L 2 proficiency. On the other hand, no relationship was found between any of the employed measures and working memory capacity. The results are discussed in the light of previous research on the relationship between second language grammatical complexity and both proficiency and working memory capacity...|$|R

However, many teachers {{have not been able}} to integrate these findings into their instruction. To this end, Nation (2007 a) came up with an approach called The Four Strands to aid vocabulary instruction. The present study aims to investigate The Four Strands as conceived by Nation. It examines whether its incorporation into the classroom will increase learners receptive and productive vocabularies. It also looks at retention of words after a period of 5 weeks. Two groups of secondary school participants took part in the study: one of them received the treatment (N= 26) and the other became the control group (N= 27). Data were collected through different tests: post‐test 1 and delayed post-test were translation tests and post‐test 2 consisted in a video retelling. Results showed that the treatment group consistently outperformed the control group, which should be interpreted regarding the possible benefits for both vocabulary teaching and learning...|$|R

Together with other figurative uses of language it {{is bound to}} cognitive developments. The goal {{of this study is}} analyzing some developmental aspects of the written production of jokes and finding suitable coding categories for the analysis. A sample of 234 multilingual children and adolescents from 6 to 16 years of age were selected from the CesCa corpus (Catalan Written in Schools of Catalonia). They had been asked to write a joke or a funny situation. The categories proved quite suitable to code types of responses in terms of speech acts, types of texts, types of jokes, production errors and multilingualism in use. The results showed an increasing development by age groups and some u-shaped behaviors by age. We interpret u-shape behavior as a point of cognitive restructuring according to the Representational Redescription Model (RRM). Regarding multilingualism, jokes showed more code-switching than other humorous texts, but an increase of Catalan use and a descent in code-switching. The study of joke production in developmental perspective {{has proven to be a}} promising domain of inquiry deserving further exploration...|$|R
