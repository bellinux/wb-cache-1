5|$|The Acurad {{system was}} the first die <b>casting</b> <b>process</b> that could {{successfully}} cast low-iron aluminum alloys, such as A356 and A357. In a traditional die <b>casting</b> <b>process</b> these alloys would solder to the die. Similarly, Acurad castings could be heat treated and meet the U.S. military specification MIL-A-21180.|$|E
5|$|Acurad was a die <b>casting</b> <b>process</b> {{developed}} by General Motors {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, and dense. It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional solidification with the fast cycle times of the traditional die <b>casting</b> <b>process.</b> The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: thermal analysis, flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die castings, and indirect squeeze casting (explained below).|$|E
5|$|The <b>casting</b> <b>process</b> of a Chinese actress {{to portray}} the heroine began in October 2016. The film was {{originally}} scheduled to be released on November 2, 2018, but it was later taken off the release schedule with The Nutcracker and the Four Realms taking its old slot.|$|E
25|$|A {{study found}} in 1997 that evaporative-pattern <b>casting</b> <b>processes</b> {{accounted}} for approximately 140,000 tons of aluminium casting in the United States.

5|$|After {{reading about}} the case while in college, Peirce {{conducted}} extensive research for a screenplay, which she worked on for almost five years. The film focuses {{on the relationship between}} Brandon and his girlfriend Lana Tisdel. The script took dialogue directly from archive footage in the 1998 documentary The Brandon Teena Story. Many actors sought the lead role during a three-year <b>casting</b> <b>process</b> before Swank was cast. Swank was chosen because her personality seemed similar to Teena's. Most of the film's characters were based on real-life people; others were composites.|$|E

Block I improvements also included a new, two-duct powerhead (rather than the original design, which featured three ducts connected to the HPFTP and two to the HPOTP), which helped improve hot gas flow, and an improved engine heat exchanger.|$|E
5|$|Die casting is a metal <b>casting</b> <b>process</b> that is {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity. The mold cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter and tin-based alloys. Depending {{on the type of}} metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.|$|E

5|$|During the <b>casting</b> <b>process,</b> Parker and {{producer}} Alan Marshall began scouting locations in New York City. On January 20, 1986, he travelled to New Orleans, where he continued writing the script. Parker looked at unused buildings located on Royal Street that could {{act as a}} hotel, and an abandoned house on Magazine Street that would serve {{as the home of}} Margaret Krusemark (Rampling). He returned to New York City where he looked at Staten Island and Coney Island. Parker's script required a total of 78 locations in New York and New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>casting</b> <b>process,</b> she was {{compared}} to Paris Hilton. Naveen Andrews, who played the character Sayid on the show, had the idea of encouraging the writers to write a romantic relationship between his character and Shannon into the story. Critics found {{her to be a}} largely unsympathetic character until only shortly before her death. Nonetheless, Grace received a Teen Choice Award nomination for her role as Shannon.|$|E
5|$|Fuller and Form {{said the}} <b>casting</b> <b>process</b> for Friday the 13th was more {{difficult}} than that for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre because thirteen young actors were involved in Friday the 13th, as opposed to five in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The pair continually recast roles to find which actors worked best together. This recasting process lasted until the start of filming. s Richard Burgi, who was cast as Sheriff Bracke, did not sign his contract until twelve hours before he was due to start filming his scenes.|$|E

5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection die casting, {{also known}} as direct-injection die casting or runnerless die casting, is a zinc die <b>casting</b> <b>process</b> where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead into the molding cavity. This process has the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|E
5|$|Hetreed {{read the}} novel before its publication, and her husband's {{production}} company convinced Chevalier {{to sell the}} film rights. Initially, the production was to feature Kate Hudson as Griet with Mike Newell directing. Hudson withdrew shortly before filming began, however, and the film was placed in hiatus until the hire of Webber, who re-initiated the <b>casting</b> <b>process.</b> In this, which was his feature film debut, Webber sought to avoid employing traditional characteristics of the period film drama. Cinematographer Eduardo Serra used distinctive lighting and colour schemes similar to Vermeer's paintings.|$|E
5|$|NBC {{bought the}} rights to The Blacklist from Sony Pictures Television in August 2012 and green-lit {{production}} in January 2013. Producers said that the <b>casting</b> <b>process</b> was difficult. They initially offered the male lead to Kiefer Sutherland before James Spader accepted the role three days before filming began. Even though the series is set in Washington, D.C., the pilot was mainly filmed in the same Manhattan studio where Law & Order was filmed.|$|E

50|$|MICAST studies {{microstructure}} formation during casting {{of technical}} alloys under diffusive and magnetically controlled convective conditions. The experimental results together with parametric studies using numerical simulations, {{will be used}} to optimize industrial <b>casting</b> <b>processes.</b> MICAST identifies and controls experimentally the fluid-flow patterns that affect microstructure evolution during <b>casting</b> <b>processes,</b> and to develop analytical and advanced numerical models. The microgravity environment of the International Space Station is of special importance to this project because only there are all gravity-induced convections eliminated and well-defined conditions for solidification prevail that can be disturbed by artificial fluid flow being under full control of the experimenters. Design solutions that make it possible to improve <b>casting</b> <b>processes</b> and especially aluminium alloys with well-defined properties will be provided. MICAST studies the influence of pure diffusive and convective conditions on aluminium-silicon (AlSi) and aluminium-silicon-iron (AlSiFe) cast alloys on the microstructure evolution during directional solidification with and without rotating magnetic field.|$|R

5|$|Sony Pictures Entertainment began {{development}} on the film in 2009. It took the company {{a few months to}} obtain the rights to the novel, while recruiting Zaillian and David Fincher. The <b>casting</b> <b>process</b> for the lead roles was exhaustive and intense; Craig faced scheduling conflicts, and a number of actresses were sought for the role of Lisbeth Salander. The script took over six months to write, which included three months of analyzing the novel.|$|E
5|$|The casting {{equipment}} and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit the process to high-volume production. Manufacture of parts using die casting is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, which keeps the incremental cost per item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized castings, which is why die casting produces more castings than any other <b>casting</b> <b>process.</b> Die castings are characterized by a very good surface finish (by casting standards) and dimensional consistency.|$|E
5|$|The <b>casting</b> <b>process</b> for Monica Reyes was unconventional. Gish {{received}} a call from her agent, who informed her that The X-Files were looking for a new female character. Gish applied for the part, but instead of having to a do a reading, she only had to meet with Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz. After receiving the part, Gish's first shot was scheduled four in the morning; her first scene in the episode was to run down a hill to discover a former abductee.|$|E
