40|$|AbstractMammalian {{fertilization}} is {{a complex}} multi-step process mediated by different molecules present on both gametes. Epididymal protein <b>CRISP</b> 1, {{a member of the}} Cysteine-RIch Secretory Protein (<b>CRISP)</b> family, was identified by our laboratory and postulated to participate in both sperm–zona pellucida (ZP) interaction and gamete fusion by binding to egg-complementary sites. To elucidate the functional role of <b>CRISP</b> 1 in vivo, we disrupted the <b>Crisp</b> 1 gene and evaluated the effect on animal fertility and several sperm parameters. Male and female <b>Crisp</b> 1 −/− animals exhibited no differences in fertility compared to controls. Sperm motility and the ability to undergo a spontaneous or progesterone-induced acrosome reaction were neither affected in <b>Crisp</b> 1 −/− mice. However, the level of protein tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation was clearly lower in mutant sperm than in controls. In vitro fertilization assays showed that <b>Crisp</b> 1 −/− sperm also exhibited a significantly reduced ability to penetrate both ZP-intact and ZP-free eggs. Moreover, when ZP-free eggs were simultaneously inseminated with <b>Crisp</b> 1 +/+ and <b>Crisp</b> 1 −/− sperm in a competition assay, the mutant sperm exhibited a greater disadvantage in their fusion ability. Finally, the finding that the fusion ability of <b>Crisp</b> 1 −/− sperm was further inhibited by the presence of <b>CRISP</b> 1 or <b>CRISP</b> 2 during gamete co-incubation, supports that another <b>CRISP</b> cooperates with <b>CRISP</b> 1 during fertilization and might compensate for its lack in the mutant mice. Together, these results indicate that <b>CRISP</b> proteins are players in the mammalian fertilization process. To our knowledge this is the first knockout mice generated for a <b>CRISP</b> protein. The information obtained might have important functional implications for other members of the widely distributed and evolutionarily conserved <b>CRISP</b> family...|$|R

40|$|Cysteine-Rich Secretory Protein 3 (<b>CRISP</b> 3) {{is found}} {{predominantly}} in the salivary gland and granulocytes of healthy subjects, but is significantly up-regulated in the malignant prostate, where {{it represents the}} most over-expressed transcript. While the expression pattern of <b>CRISP</b> 3, its up-regulation in several inflammatory pathologies and the immunosuppressive role of related proteins in other species suggest a role for human <b>CRISP</b> 3 in the regulation of the immune response, no definitive function has been demonstrated. An anti-proliferative role of <b>CRISP</b> 3 in prostate cancer has also been proposed based on in vitro transfection experiments. Progress in understanding <b>CRISP</b> 3 function has been slow due partly {{to the fact that}} <b>CRISP</b> 3 is normally expressed at low levels and has a complex tertiary structure defined by eight conserved disulfide bonds, thus limiting attempts at purification from both native and recombinant sources for use in functional assays. Efforts to purify <b>CRISP</b> 3 from bacterial expression systems have invariably given rise to misfolded protein aggregates. The aims of the work presented in this thesis were threefold; to establish an efficient system of purification of <b>CRISP</b> 3 in its native conformation, to investigate the effects of <b>CRISP</b> 3 on prostatic epithelial cell proliferation, and to define the effect of <b>Crisp</b> 3 knockout in the Hi-Myc model of murine prostate cancer. In Chapter 2, I present a two-step system for recombinant <b>CRISP</b> 3 expression and purification involving cation-exchange and size exclusion chromatography based on a mammalian expression system. This protocol provided milligram quantities of recombinant <b>CRISP</b> 3. The presence of appropriate post-translational modifications and the interaction of the purified protein with a known <b>CRISP</b> 3 binding partner, which was abolished with <b>CRISP</b> 3 denaturation, indicated that the recombinant protein was likely to be in its native conformation. A comparative study of N-glycosylation sites and types within human and mouse <b>CRISP</b> 3 was undertaken, and revealed striking interspecies differences in post-translational modification. This represents the first study of mouse <b>CRISP</b> 3 and characterization of its glycosylation pattern. Our recombinant <b>CRISP</b> 3 preparation was used alongside transfection experiments to show, in Chapter 3, that contrary to a published report, neither extracellular treatment with, nor intracellular overexpression of, <b>CRISP</b> 3 directly affected the proliferation of PC 3 prostate cancer cells. Similarly, shRNA knockdown of <b>Crisp</b> 3 had no effect on prostate cell proliferation. In order to investigate the in vivo function of <b>CRISP</b> 3 in prostate malignancy, we made use of the murine Hi-Myc model of prostate cancer, which relies on the induced prostate-specific overexpression of the human c-Myc oncogene to initiate cancer, which typically becomes invasive between 6 - 12 months of age. A two-generational breeding programme was used to generate <b>Crisp</b> 3 -/- and <b>Crisp</b> 3 +/+ Hi-Myc mice. Cancer progression in the two genotypes was compared with histology and markers of proliferation, tumour burden, invasion, and tumour leukocyte infiltration. <b>CRISP</b> 3 expression was absent in the normal wild type prostate, but underwent significant up-regulation between 5 to 7 months in the Hi-Myc lateral prostate. This up-regulation coincided with accelerated progression to an invasive cancer phenotype by 7 months in the <b>Crisp</b> 3 +/+ animals. In contrast, <b>Crisp</b> 3 knockout totally suppressed progression from duct-contained (carcinoma in situ) to invasive prostate cancer in <b>Crisp</b> 3 -/- mice at 7 months. Hence, the experiments presented in this thesis demonstrate {{for the first time that}} <b>CRISP</b> 3 is pro-tumourigenic in the malignant prostate. Based on immunhistochemistry with the proliferation marker Ki 67 and the work contained in Chapter 3, <b>CRISP</b> 3 is unlikely to directly affect the proliferation of prostatic epithelium. Rather, preliminary data suggest that inflammatory mediators such as TGF-β can induce <b>CRISP</b> 3 up-regulation, which in turn may act on both the prostatic epithelium to promote an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and on tumour-infiltrating immune cells to condition a tolerogenic immune phenotype. This work therefore represents an important advance in the field’s understanding of the role of <b>CRISP</b> 3 in prostate cancer. Open Acces...|$|R
