40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the mechanical properties of graded crushed rocks (GCRs) and to optimize the relevant design, a numerical test method based on the particle flow modeling technique PFC 2 D is developed for the California bearing ratio (CBR) test on GCRs. The effects of different testing conditions and micro-mechanical parameters used in the model on the CBR numerical results have been systematically studied. The reliability of the numerical technique is verified. The numerical results suggest that the influences of the loading rate and Poisson's ratio on the CBR numerical test results are not significant. As such, a loading rate of 1. 0 – 3. 0  mm/min, a piston diameter of 5  cm, a specimen height of 15  cm and a specimen diameter of 15  cm are adopted for the CBR numerical test.

The range of the field CBR is larger (2 to 30  %) than the range of laboratory one which is from 15.5 to 29.5  %. The resilient modulus values follow a similar trend with values ranging between zero to 108  MPa (except 130, 202 and 304  MPa) as range for field, and 50 to 100  MPa as laboratory <b>values.</b> Since laboratory <b>CBR</b> and resilient modulus are to serve as control for field earthworks operations this implies that the desired field <b>CBR</b> <b>values</b> can easily be achieved and, in some cases, surpass desired values. With respect to resilient modulus, the field values were the least available in situ; for those locations with values less than 50  MPa (the minimum laboratory value) the field resilient modulus values have to be brought up to this value at those locations.

The main objective {{of the study was}} to establish whether or not sugar cane molasses can be used as a stabilizing agent for expansive clay soil used for engineering purposes. Other objectives were to carry out analysis of cane molasses; to carry out strength assessment of neat expansive soil and expansive soil mixed with cane molasses as reflected by California bearing ratio (CBR). Cane molasses was selected for this purpose because it contained some elements/compounds which are known to react with clay minerals and change characteristics of the soil. It was established that 8 % cane molasses by weight of dry soil was the maximum for effective stabilization of expansive clay soil. On comparison lime stabilized soil specimens gave higher <b>CBR</b> <b>values</b> than cane molasses. The conclusion was that the increase in <b>CBR</b> <b>values</b> for expansive soil mixed with cane molasses above those of neat expansive soil was an indication that cane molasses caused the increase in soil strength and therefore it stabilized expansive clay soil. It was also observed that cane molasses mixed with expansive clay soil could reduce swelling tendencies of the soil. _________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} sodium {{chloride}} on subgrade soil was investigated. Twenty subgrade soil samples stored in plastic containers {{were subjected to}} differing concentrations of NaCl for 364 days. They were tested for exchangeable sodium Na+, chloride Cl-, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and California Bearing Ratio (CBR). The results showed that <b>CBR</b> <b>values</b> decreased with increase in the Na+, Cl- and CEC values. The model developed revealed that soil CBR improved with time. The time was function of Na+, Cl- and CEC magnitudes. (Keywords: cation exchange capacity, CEC, Californi...|$|R
