40|$|Due {{to their}} DC-blocking characteristic, <b>coupling</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{are widely used}} to prevent {{potentially}} harmful charge buildup at the electrode–tissue interface. Although the capacitors {{can be an effective}} safety measure, it often seems overlooked that <b>coupling</b> <b>capacitors</b> actually introduce an offset voltage over the electrode–tissue interface as well. This work investigates this offset voltage both analytically and experimentally. The calculations as well as the experiments using bipolar-driven platinum electrodes in a saline solution confirm that <b>coupling</b> <b>capacitors</b> introduce an offset, while they barely contribute to the passive charge balancing. In particular cases, this offset is shown to reach potentially dangerous voltage levels that could induce irreversible electrochemical reactions. This work therefore suggests that when the use of <b>coupling</b> <b>capacitors</b> is required, the offset voltage should be analyzed for all operating conditions to ensure it remains within safe boundaries.
