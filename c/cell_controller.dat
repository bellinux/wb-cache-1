40|$|A {{real-time}} {{scheduling and}} control methodology in dioid algebra that allows repeated production of parts over the planning horizon of a flow-shop {{in the presence}} of disturbances is proposed in this paper. The behavior of a manufacturing system as an discrete-event dynamic system can be completely characterized by the knowledge of starting and ending times of its activities. Dioid algebra can be used to represent discrete event dynamic systems where relationships between the starting times of the activities require maximum and addition operators and are linear in the sense of dioid algebra. To use dioid algebra in a real-time scheduling and control methodology, conflict resolution and optimization are introduced into dioid algebra with this study.

In this structure, the <b>cell</b> <b>controller</b> determines a feasible sequence of events, which are identified as start times of operations that optimize a given scheduling objective.

Given information at the mechanical level (beam strain), each <b>cell</b> <b>controller</b> is able to modify the local truss structure (beam size and length) during a developmental process. The advantage of such a method relies on the idea that a template <b>cell</b> <b>controller</b> is duplicated over all cells, keeping the optimization search space very low, while each cell may act in a different manner depending on local information.

40|$|Many {{processes}} in the brain, both normal and pathological, involve oscillations of neuronal populations. The ability to enhance or disrupt neuronal synchrony has been clinically demonstrated to have remarkable effects {{in a number of}} neurological disorders including: Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Epilepsy, and Depression [1, 2]. We have developed an algorithm to control the spike timing of periodically firing neuron using patch clamp and realtime dynamic clamp techniques [3]. Furthermore, this algorithm was expanded to control the relative spike timing between two oscillating neurons. These present the first steps towards more precise population control schemes. The single <b>cell</b> <b>controller</b> uses the neurons phase response curve and the relationship between the spike advance and the current injection at a given stimulus phase to create a control function [4]. The two <b>cell</b> <b>controller</b> uses the same premise as the single <b>cell</b> <b>controller,</b> but incorporates additional logic to determine the direction and number of periods required to achieve the target phase offset. We tested our controller using a real-time model neuron and CA 1 pyramidal neurons [5]. Noise was added to the model neuron to replicate that seen in biological neurons. In single cell control experiments, the controller could account for ~ 99 % and ~ 87 % of the neurons variance for the model and CA 1 pyramidal neuron, respectively. In two cell experiments, we tested the controller using two noisy model neurons and we performed hybrid testing using a model neuron as the leader and a pyramidal neuron as the follower. In the hybrid case, the controller accuracy was moderate, with a normalized vector correlation of 0. 69. In the tw...|$|E

The main goal is to propose a design methodology for obtaining the model of the so-called Virtual Plant, that a remote and certified user will use to access the real plant for performing command actions and/or monitoring. The type of applications and systems targeted must have autonomous behavior and be interconnected and accessible. Reliability, maintainability and flexibility are also required goals, as well as a high rate of reusability of the applications. The methodology has been applied to the remote process monitoring and control of manufacturing processes.
