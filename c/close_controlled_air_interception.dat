During the 1990s, the group supported numerous humanitarian and combat operations in Europe, Africa, and Southwest Asia, including Operations Provide Promise, Deny Flight, and Allied Force in Yugoslavia, and Provide Comfort and Northern Watch over northern Iraq. In February 1995, the 352d relocated from RAF Alconbury to its current home of RAF Mildenhall.|$|R

The wing is prepared to conduct a variety of high priority, low-visibility missions supporting U.S. and allied special operations forces during peacetime, joint operations exercises, and combat operations. It trains and performs special operations primarily in the USEUCOM and USAFRICOM area of operations, including establishing air assault landing zones, <b>controlling</b> <b>close</b> <b>air</b> support by strike aircraft and gunships, and providing trauma care for wounded and injured personnel.|$|R

50|$|The 3rd Battalion, 7th Field Artillery 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 25th (Light) Infantry Division, was in Afghanistan {{as part of}} Joint Task Force 76 in Operation Enduring Freedom 2004-2005. The {{unit was}} {{headquartered}} at Kandahar Airfield and provided indirect fire, <b>close</b> combat <b>air</b> <b>control,</b> and fire support for the Bronco Brigade and throughout Afghanistan during the 12-month rotation. The battalion, augmented by coalition partners, was responsible for Kandahar Province and conducted infantry missions during the deployment, conducting patrols in the districts surrounding the city of Kandahar. During this deployment, Bravo Battery (Bulls) was recorded as having shot the first artillery round against a hostile enemy for the 25th (L)ID since Vietnam.|$|R

50|$|The {{engine control}} unit (ECU) {{controls}} the position {{of one or more}} <b>air</b> <b>control</b> valves based on input signals from throttle angle and engine RPM. The vacuum switching valve (VSV) which controls the vacuum supply to the actuator is normally closed and passes vacuum to the actuator when it is energized by the ECU. By energizing the VSV vacuum is passed to the actuator, <b>closing</b> the <b>air</b> <b>control</b> valve. This effectively lengthens the intake manifold run. By de-energizing the VSV, vacuum to the actuator is blocked and trapped vacuum is bled off of the actuator diaphragm. Toyota ACIS is an On/Off system. The valve (or valves in newer models with multiple valves to create more than 2 lengths) is either fully opened or fully closed.An example of early single-valve ACIS programming would be the 3.0L 3VZ-FE engine. The ECU actuates the VSV to close the valve when the throttle position is 60% or greater and engine speed is 3,900 RPM or more.|$|R
5000|$|Malmesbury {{specialised}} in the top-secret {{development and}} production of the new radar systems {{as part of the}} [...] "Western Development Unit". Radar equipment produced at Malmesbury during the war included the AI Mk. IV and AI Mk. VIII <b>air</b> <b>interception</b> radars, and the ASV Mk. II air to surface vessel radar.|$|R
50|$|An air-to-air rocket or <b>air</b> <b>interception</b> rocket is an unguided {{projectile}} {{fired from}} aircraft to engage other flying targets. They were used briefly in World War I to engage enemy observation balloons and in and after World War II to engage enemy bombers. Fighters were too maneuverable to be effectively engaged with rockets.|$|R
5000|$|The {{squadron}} conducted <b>air</b> <b>interception</b> training missions {{with its}} F-51s until June 1952 {{when it was}} re-equipped with the F-86F Sabre daylight interceptor. [...] On 1 November 1952, the 123rd was released back to the Oregon ANG and its personnel, mission and equipment were absorbed by the newly activated 357th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron.|$|R
50|$|During WestPac in 1955, the {{squadron}} {{was part of}} the Navy's support of the evacuation of the Tachen Islands which were under bombardment by People's Republic of China forces. After returning from this cruise, {{the squadron}} re-equipped with the F7U Cutlass and its role was changed from <b>air</b> <b>interception</b> to ground attack with special weapons.|$|R
5000|$|After the UN {{landings}} at Inchon in late September, {{the squadron}} (nicknamed [...] "Mosquitoes"), directed {{air strikes against}} retreating enemy troops ahead of the advancing UN lines and operated as the eyes of UN ground forces. Squadron controllers also conducted deep penetrations into enemy country, search and rescue, night direction for B-26s, parachute-drop mission coordination, and artillery adjustment. As the enemy fled, the squadron moved to Kimpo AB, where the pilots were within minutes of their working areas but also within range of enemy snipers on takeoffs and landings. By late October, the squadron had moved to Pyongyang but in December retreated to Taegu, where it returned to <b>controlling</b> <b>close</b> <b>air</b> support missions. In January 1951, the 6147th TCS gained a C-47 that provided an airborne radio relay between the Joint Operations Center and controllers, enabling Mosquitoes {{to adapt to the}} changing combat situation.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, the 415th Night Fighter Squadron was {{activated}} on 10 February 1943. At that time, {{the squadron}} {{was assigned to}} the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics for training in the P-70 fighter, a converted A-20 Havoc light bomber. That training included daylight and night <b>air</b> <b>interception,</b> ground-controlled interception, navigation, and instrument flying.|$|R
2500|$|Canada was {{the first}} export {{customer}} for the Hornet, replacing the CF-104 Starfighter (air reconnaissance and strike), the McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo (<b>air</b> <b>interception)</b> and the CF-116 Freedom Fighter (ground attack). The Canadian Forces Air Command ordered 98 A models (Canadian designation CF-188A/CF-18A) and 40 B models (designation CF-188B/CF-18B). [...] The original CF-18 as delivered is largely identical to the F/A-18A and B models.|$|R
50|$|Snell {{returned}} to Britain {{during the summer}} of 1942 and joined No. 242 Squadron RAF flying Spitfires. In October 1942 his unit was transferred to North Africa to provide air cover for the Operation Torch landings. For the rest of 1942 and into early 1943, Snell's squadron provided <b>air</b> <b>interception</b> and ground attack sorties in support of the British First Army as it drove towards Tunis.|$|R
50|$|An Australian-American {{intercept}} {{station was}} later built at Townsville, Queensland. US Air Force Far East, and its subordinate 5th <b>Air</b> Force, took <b>control</b> of the 126th in June 1943. The 126th was eventually placed under operational <b>control</b> of U.S. <b>Air</b> Force Far East in June 1943 to support 5th <b>Air</b> Force. <b>Interception</b> and traffic analysis {{from the company}} supported the attack into Dutch New Guinea in 1944.|$|R
2500|$|... 1942 {{also saw}} the {{manufacture}} of twelve Hurricane II C(NF) night fighters, equipped with pilot-operated <b>Air</b> <b>Interception</b> Mark VI radar. After a brief operational deployment with No. 245 and No. 247 Squadron RAF during which these aircraft proved too slow for operations in Europe, the aircraft were sent to India to serve with No. 176 Squadron RAF in the defence of Calcutta. They were withdrawn from service {{at the end of}} December 1943.|$|R
50|$|Despite the problems, the Navy ordered 239 F3H-2s, and {{the first}} were {{deployed}} in March 1956. 519 Demons were built {{up to the end}} of production in November 1959. It was not the Navy's first all-weather interceptor with radar (the AN/APG-51 <b>air</b> <b>interception</b> set was used first on the F2H-4 Banshee). The F3H-2 Demon had the AN/APG-51A, later upgraded to the 51-B version with a tunable magnetron then on to 51-C with better counter-measures in the receiver.|$|R
50|$|This eventuality {{had already}} been foreseen, and a {{successful}} programme by Edward George Bowen starting in 1936 developed a miniaturized RDF system suitable for aircraft, the <b>Air</b> <b>Interception</b> (AI) set. (Watson-Watt called the CH sets the RDF-1 and the AI the RDF-2A.) At the same time, Bowen developed AI sets for aircraft to detect submarines, the Air to Surface Vessel (ASV) set was also developed, making {{a significant contribution to}} the Battle of the Atlantic defeat of the German U-boats.|$|R

A H2S-equipped Short Stirling bomber had crashed near Rotterdam {{on the night of}} 2 February 1943. This led to H2S being given the German codename Rotterdam Gerät. Telefunken were instructed to examine the wreckage and build six replicas of it. This study also {{led to the development of}} the Naxos radar detector against it.> ...|$|R
