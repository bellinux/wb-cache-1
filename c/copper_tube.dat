5|$|We {{consider}} {{the surface area}} of the entire mass of mercury, including {{the part of the}} surface that is in contact with the glass, because mercury does not adhere to glass at all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area, including where it is in contact with the glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a <b>copper</b> <b>tube,</b> the level of mercury {{at the center of the}} tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we {{consider the}} part of the fluid's surface area that is in contact with the container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container.|$|E

25|$|Various {{types of}} solar {{collectors}} for residential applications {{are available with}} either direct circulation (i.e., heats water and brings it directly to the home for use) or indirect circulation (i.e., pumps a heat transfer fluid through a heat exchanger, which then heats water that flows into the home) systems. In an evacuated tube solar hot water heater with an indirect circulation system, the evacuated tubes contain a glass outer tube and metal absorber tube attached to a fin. Solar thermal energy is absorbed within the evacuated tubes and is converted into usable concentrated heat. Evacuated glass tubes have a double layer. Inside the glass tube is the copper heat pipe. It is a sealed hollow <b>copper</b> <b>tube</b> that contains {{a small amount of}} thermal transfer fluid (water or glycol mixture) which under low pressure boils at a very low temperature. The copper heat pipe transfers thermal energy from within the solar tube into a copper header. As the solution circulates through the copper header, the temperature rises.|$|E

40|$|Demands {{for higher}} energy {{efficiencies}} in both {{residential and commercial}} refrigeration and air conditioning systems {{have resulted in a}} trend toward heat exchanger designs that are more compact with higher capacities for heat transfer. Traditional copper tube/aluminum fin coil manufacturing technology remains prevalent throughout the industry and, when modified for smaller diameter <b>copper</b> <b>tubes</b> of 5 mm or less, significant improvements in heat transfer can be achieved. When coupled with internal enhancements to the <b>copper</b> <b>tubes</b> such as microgrooves, coil designs can be smaller, more efficient and less costly. Using a commercially available heat exchanger design and simulation software and CFD modeling, this paper compares optimized 3 -ton air conditioning condenser coils manufactured with small-diameter internally enhanced <b>copper</b> <b>tubes</b> against condensers with aluminum microchannel tubes. Simulated operating conditions are held constant, including refrigerant inlet pressure and temperature, as well as air flow rate and inlet temperature. Comparisons of material consumption, refrigerant charge, volume, and heat transfer performance are demonstrated.

50|$|Another {{possibility}} {{to avoid a}} strong tensile stress when sealing copper through glass {{is the use of}} a thin walled <b>copper</b> <b>tube</b> instead of a solid wire. Here a shear stress builds up in the glass-to-metal interface which is limited by the low tensile strength of the copper combined with a low tensile stress. The <b>copper</b> <b>tube</b> is insensitive to high electric current compared to a Dumet-seal because on heating the tensile stress converts into a compression stress which is again limited by the tensile strength of the copper. Also, it is possible to lead an additional solid copper wire through the <b>copper</b> <b>tube.</b> In a later variant, only a short section of the <b>copper</b> <b>tube</b> has a thin wall and the <b>copper</b> <b>tube</b> is hindered to shrink at cooling by a ceramic tubeinside the <b>copper</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
