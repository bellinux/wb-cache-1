Integration {{raises the question of}} cohesion among different territories, and territorial cohesion is a new objective for the Union according to the Lisbon Treaty. Cooperation between territories, beyond frontiers and across different institutional layers, {{is becoming}} crucial for providing multi-level governance to new functional regions. The European Grouping <b>of</b> Territorial Cooperation (<b>EGTC),</b> <b>a</b> new legal and governance tool established by Regulation 1082 / 2006, was conceived as a substantial upgrade for this multi-level governance and beyond-the-border cooperation. Four years after its adoption, <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> <b>EGTCs</b> have been set up, and new ones are in the pipeline. Recently the European Commission and the Committee of the Regions have launched a consultation with the aim to review the existing legislation since 2007 on the EGTC and adjust it if necessary. The results are to be presented this year in Brussels during the 8 th edition of the Open Days. The article first highlights the EGTC framework in support <b>of</b> integration at <b>a</b> regional level and shows the background of the regulation. It then focuses on the legal issues involved, such as legal personality, potential members, tasks, organisation, state control, and liability <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>EGTC.</b> After showing the implementation status <b>of</b> <b>a</b> national <b>EGTC,</b> the article closes with further steps to be taken...|$|R

The work describes the instrument, including the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> legal basis. It also {{deals with the}} potential use of the EGTC, which focuses on the permanent structure for cross-border cooperation, ie. Euroregions and make <b>a</b> summary <b>of</b> the <b>EGTC</b> already developed within the European Union. The practical part focuses on <b>a</b> description <b>of</b> the Euroregion Neisse, who ordered the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> legal entity {{as one of the}} main objectives and is currently in the process of preparing the establishment <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>EGTC.</b> This section is in addition to the characteristics of the Euroregion analysis of individual steps in the creation, use specific options on the EGTC and the comparison with existing legal entities within the EU. The aim of the thesis is to analyze the EGTC and determine whether it has the potential {{for the development of the}} Euroregion Neisse...|$|R
