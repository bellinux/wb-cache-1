40|$|Abstract — Most {{previous}} works on text classification, represented importance of terms by term occurrence frequency (tf) and inverse document frequency (idf). This paper presents {{the ways to}} apply <b>class</b> <b>frequency</b> in centroid-based text categorization. Three approaches are taken into account. The first one is to explore the effectiveness of inverse <b>class</b> <b>frequency</b> on the popular term weighting, i. e., TFIDF, as a replacement of idf and an addition to TFIDF. The second approach is to evaluate some functions, which are used to adjust the power of inverse <b>class</b> <b>frequency.</b> The other approach is to apply terms, which are found in only one class or few classes, to improve classification performance, using two-step classification. From the results, <b>class</b> <b>frequency</b> expresses its usefulness on text classification, especially the two-step classification.

Membrane topography was analyzed with respect to intramembranous particle densities and size <b>class</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the 2, 4, and 8 -cell embryonic stages. Results show similarities in membrane topography between cells of the 2 -cell stage, and between cells of the 4 -cell stage. Overall membrane particle size <b>class</b> <b>frequencies</b> between the 2 and 4 -cell stages are similar, yet the 8 -cell embryo is comprised of cells that differ {{from each other and}} the previous embryonic stages topographically in membrane particle densities and size <b>class</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Both the 2 and 4 -cell embryonic stages contain cells with homogeneous particle distributions, while some cells of the 8 -cell stage show membrane particle heterogeneities. Membrane particle clusters appear in some cells of 8 -cell embryos, yet no clusters were apparent in membranes of the 2 and 4 -cell stages. Results indicate that membrane particle homogeneity is apparent in blastomeres of the 2 and 4 -cell stages, yet massive membrane particle insertion and reorganization occurs during division of the 4 -cell embryo. The membrane structural changes observed correlate well with the overall pattern of determination {{in the early}} development of the sea urchin embryo...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} {{compares the}} performance of discriminative and generative classifiers for cost sensitive learning. There {{is some evidence that}} learning a discriminative classifier is more effective for a traditional classification task. This paper explores the advantages, and disadvantages, of using a generative classifier when the misclassification costs, and <b>class</b> <b>frequencies,</b> are not fixed. The paper details experiments built around commonly used algorithms modified to be cost sensitive. This allows a clear comparison to the same algorithm used to produce a discriminative classifier. The paper compares {{the performance of}} these different variants over multiple data sets and for the full range of misclassification costs and <b>class</b> <b>frequencies.</b> It concludes that although some of these variants are better than a single discriminative classifier, the right choice of training set distribution plus careful calibration are needed to make them competitive with multiple discriminative classifiers. ...|$|R
40|$|Self-organizing map (SOM) is {{naturally}} unsupervised learning, but ifa class label is known, {{it can be}} used as the classifier. In SOM classifier, each neuron is assigned a class label based on the maximum <b>class</b> <b>frequency</b> and classified by a nearest neighbor strategy. The drawback when using this strategy is that each pattern is treated by equal importance in counting <b>class</b> <b>frequency</b> regardless of its typicalness. For this reason, the fuzzy class membership can be used instead of crisp <b>class</b> <b>frequency</b> and this fuzzymembership-label neuron provides another perspective of a feature map. This fuzzy class membership can be also used to select training samples in support vector machines (SVM) classifier. This method allows us to reduce the training set as well as support vectors without significant loss of classification performance. 1...|$|E

The effect of such corrections in random forests of PETs is investigated, {{and the use}} of the relative <b>class</b> <b>frequency</b> is compared to using two corrected estimates, the Laplace estimate and the m-estimate. An experiment with 34 datasets from the UCI repository shows that estimating class probabilities using relative <b>class</b> <b>frequency</b> clearly outperforms both using the Laplace estimate and the m-estimate with respect to accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC) and Brier score. Hence, in contrast to what is commonly employed for PETs and ensembles of PETs, these results strongly suggest that a non-corrected probability estimate should be used in random forests of PETs. The experiment further shows that learning random forests of PETs using relative <b>class</b> <b>frequency</b> significantly outperforms learning random forests of classification trees (i. e., trees for which only an unweighted vote on the most probable class is counted) with respect to both accuracy and AUC, but that the latter is clearly ahead of the former with respect to Brier score...|$|E

The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine whether a comparison of the frequency distributions could be used to determine the chronology of SP development in the AD brain. SP from 10 microns to a maximum diameter of 160 microns were present in the tissue and the size <b>class</b> <b>frequency</b> distributions were positively skewed. The frequency distributions varied between brain regions in: (1) the size class containing the mode, (2) the degree of positive skew, and (3) the ratio of large to small SP. In most patients the ratio of large to small SP was higher in the hippocampus or adjacent gyrus compared with temporal, parietal and frontal neocortex. If the diameter of a SP reflects its age in the tissue than the data suggest that SP formed earlier either in the hippocampus or adjacent gyrus compared with the other neocortical tissues. However, this conclusion rests on a number of assumptions including: (1) that SP diameter is directly related to age, (2) that SP development occurs at similar rates in different brain regions and (3) that, once formed, SP are not removed from the tissue by astrocytes...|$|E
