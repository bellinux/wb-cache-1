50|$|A <b>coated</b> <b>abrasive</b> {{comprises}} an abrasive {{fixed to}} a backing material such as paper, cloth, rubber, resin, polyester or even metal, {{many of which}} are flexible. Sandpaper is a very common <b>coated</b> <b>abrasive.</b> Coated abrasives are commonly the same minerals as are used for bonded abrasives. A bonding agent (often some sort of adhesive or resin) is applied to the backing to provide a flat surface to which the grit is then subsequently adhered. A woven backing may also use a filler agent (again, often a resin) to provide additional resilience.|$|E

50|$|A flapwheel and {{the related}} flap disk is an {{abrasive}} disk, used for metal finishing. Unlike the simpler flat disks, made from a circular flat sheet of a <b>coated</b> <b>abrasive,</b> a flapwheel is made of multiple overlapping small pieces or 'flaps', bonded to a central hub.|$|E
50|$|A <b>coated</b> <b>{{abrasive}}</b> is an {{abrasive grain}} bonded to a flexible substrate using adhesives. Common substrates are paper, cloth, vulcanized fiber, and plastic films {{and come in}} grit sizes range from very coarse (~2 mm) to ultrafine (submicrometre). The international standard for coated abrasives is ISO 6344.|$|E
5000|$|The shape, {{size and}} nature of the {{workpiece}} and the desired finish will influence the choice of the abrasive used. A bonded abrasive grind wheel may be used to commercially sharpen a knife (producing a hollow grind), but an individual may then sharpen the same knife with a natural sharpening stone or an even flexible <b>coated</b> <b>abrasive</b> (like a sandpaper) stuck to a soft, non-slip surface to make achieving a convex grind easier. Similarly, a brass mirror may be cut with a bonded abrasive, have its surface flattened with a <b>coated</b> <b>abrasive</b> to achieve a basic shape, and then have finer grades of abrasive successively appied culminating in a wax paste impregnated with rouge to leave a sort of [...] "grainless finish" [...] called, in this case, a [...] "mirror finish".|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{objectives}} possible for grinding with <b>coated</b> <b>abrasives.</b> Among {{them are the}} right application (e.g. finish or stock removal), time saving and efficiency of the abrasive tool.|$|R

50|$|Files are not abrasives; they remove {{material}} not by scratching or rubbing, but by {{the cutting}} action of sharp teeth which have been cut into {{the surface of the}} file, very much like those of a saw. However, diamond files are a form of <b>coated</b> <b>abrasive</b> (as they are metal rods coated with diamond powder).|$|E
5000|$|Emery cloth {{is a type}} of <b>coated</b> <b>abrasive</b> {{that has}} emery glued to a cloth backing. It is used for hand metalworking. It may be sold in sheets or in narrow rolls, {{typically}} 25 or 50 mm wide, often described as [...] "emery tape". The cloth backing makes emery cloth stronger in tension than sandpaper, but still allows a sheet to be conveniently torn to size.|$|E

50|$|<b>Coated</b> <b>abrasives</b> may {{be shaped}} {{for use in}} rotary and orbital sanders, for {{wrapping}} around sanding blocks, as handpads, as closed loops for use on belt grinders, as striking surfaces on matchboxes, on diamond plates and diamond steels. Diamond tools, though for cutting, are often abrasive in nature.|$|R
50|$|Abrasives {{are shaped}} for various purposes. Natural {{abrasives}} are often sold as dressed stones, {{usually in the}} form of a rectangular block. Both natural and synthetic abrasives are commonly available in a wide variety of shapes, often coming as bonded or <b>coated</b> <b>abrasives,</b> including blocks, belts, discs, wheels, sheets, rods and loose grains.|$|R
5000|$|Sandpaper or glasspaper are names {{used for}} a type of <b>coated</b> <b>abrasive</b> that {{consists}} of sheets of paper or cloth with abrasive material glued to one face.Despite {{the use of the}} names neither sand nor glass are now used in the manufacture of these products as they have been replaced by other abrasives such as aluminium oxide or silicon carbide. Sandpaper is produced in a range of grit sizes and is used to remove material from surfaces, either to make them smoother (for example, in painting and wood finishing), to remove a layer of material (such as old paint), or sometimes to make the surface rougher (for example, as a preparation for gluing). It is common to use the name of the abrasive when describing the paper, e.g. [...] "aluminium oxide paper", or [...] "silicon carbide paper".|$|E
5000|$|Grit size {{refers to}} the size of the {{particles}} of abrading materials embedded in the sandpaper. Several standards have been established for grit size. These standards establish not only the average grit size, but also the allowable variation from the average. The two most common are the United States CAMI (<b>Coated</b> <b>Abrasive</b> Manufacturers Institute, now part of the Unified Abrasives Manufacturer's Association) and the European FEPA (Federation of European Producers of Abrasives) [...] "P" [...] grade. The FEPA system is the same as the ISO 6344 standard. Other systems used in sandpaper include the Japanese Industrial Standards Committee (JIS), the micron grade (generally used for very fine grits). The [...] "ought" [...] system ({0, 00, 000, ...} aka {1/0, 2/0, 3/0, ...}) was used in the past in the US. Cheaper sandpapers sometimes use nomenclature such as [...] "Coarse", [...] "Medium" [...] and [...] "Fine", but it is unclear to what standards these names refer.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{selected}} {{results of measurements}} {{and analysis of the}} active surfaces {{of a new generation of}} <b>coated</b> <b>abrasive</b> tools obtained by the use of focus-variation microscopy (FVM) are presented and discussed. The origin of this technique, as well as its general metrological characteristics is briefly described. Additionally, information regarding the focus variation microscope used in the experiments - InfiniteFocus® IF G 4 produced by Alicona Imaging, is also given. The measurements were carried out on microfinishing films (IMFF), abrasive portable belts with Cubitron™ II grains, and single-layer abrasive discs with Trizact™ grains. The obtained results were processed and analyzed employing TalyMap 4. 0 software in the form of maps and profiles, surface microtopographies, Abbott- Firestone curves, and calculated values of selected areal parameters. This allowed us to describe the active surfaces of the <b>coated</b> <b>abrasive</b> tools, as well as to assess the possibility of applying the FVM technique in such kinds of measurements...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was a {{comparative}} analysis of static shear strength of single-lap adhesive joints of 316 L steel adherends, measured prior to and after mechanical treatment with a P 320 grit <b>coated</b> <b>abrasive</b> tool. The study was of comparative nature and focused on adhesive joints subjected to thermal cycling. The tests were carried out on joints bonded with Epidian 5 and Epidian 6 epoxy adhesives hardened with Z 1 and PAC curing agents. The static shear strength tests results of single-lap adhesive joints were analysed with regard to different surface treatment variants. The scope of tests covered a relatively short fatigue cycle, i. e. 200 cycles in the range of temperatures between - 40 oC and + 60 oC. This paper includes the surface free energy and selected surface roughness parameters of substrates and images showing the surface of adherends before and after mechanical treatment with P 320 grit <b>coated</b> <b>abrasive</b> tool...|$|E
40|$|The author {{explores the}} {{drilling}} operation of some new engineering {{materials such as}} carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) and other polymers that have an anisotropic structure, high-strength and elastic properties combined with low heat endurance. Such combination of properties makes impossible the simple transfer of the existing technologies for classic materials working to considered new class. At the same time, the existing tools cannot assure the specified quality of tooled products at the current productivity and tool life. Aim: The aim {{of this research is}} to increase the process efficiency of diamond drilling in composite polymers by developing the new designs of diamond drill bits. Materials and Methods: One of the most promising directions to solve this problem is the diamond <b>coated</b> <b>abrasive</b> type tool. This paper addresses and classifies the existing types of diamond drill bits according to their application and operation. The literature data analysis of known disadvantages during drilling operation, the quality of surface and joining face was performed. Results: The experimental researches of the author prove the negative meaning of the already known but kept out fact – the drill core blocking. The most important factors and structural features affecting the CFRP drilling process are revealed. The accounting of these factors allowed creating the set of unique designs of diamond drill bits for different purposes. The presented patented models has different allowance distribution schemes and cutting forces, thus satisfy the mechanical requirements of quality, productivity, tool life and hole geometry in the tooling of the specified material class...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{advances}} in paints and coatings technology, protective coatings {{are prone to}} eventual corrosion, degradation and/or failure. Consequently, a corrosive layer will develop that can undermine the performance and integrity of structural components. Therefore, both the corrosive layer and defunct coating must be periodically removed, and an acceptable level of surface cleanliness and texture must be obtained prior to the reapplication of new paint. Currently, an array of processes and equipment are used for efficiently cleaning and conditioning metallic surfaces, such as grit blasting, needle guns, {{and a variety of}} non-woven and <b>coated</b> <b>abrasive</b> tools. This research investigates the method termed the 2 ̆ 2 bristle blasting 2 ̆ 2 process. The process utilizes a specially designed rotary bristle tool, which is dynamically tuned to a power tool spindle that operates at approximately 2, 500 rpm. The present research suggests that the repeated collision of hardened bristle tips with a corroded steel surface results in both the removal of a friable corrosive layer and simultaneous exposure of fresh subsurface material. Surfaces generated by the bristle blast process are shown to mimic the visual cleanliness and anchor profile that is characteristic of grit blasting processes. One particular application evaluated during this research was offshore pipeline refurbishment and pre-treatment of weld seams prior to the application of protective coatings. Comparative analysis was done with conventional methods of surface treatment on the basis of visual cleanliness, surface profile generation and coating adhesion strength. The results obtained suggest that this novel technology performs better than the existing conventional power tool methods and is on an equal par with grit blasting methods. Moreover, the bristle blasting process is eco-friendly and does not use or generate hazardous waste, thereby providing a 2 ̆ 2 green 2 ̆ 2 approach to corrosion removal and surface preparation of steel components...|$|E
5000|$|Belt {{grinding}} with <b>coated</b> <b>abrasives</b> can be {{an attractive}} process because the large surface area of the recirculating belt tends to carry away heat and prevent local hot spots. The productivity of this technology is, in many cases, three times that of rotary or reciprocating vertical grinders. [...] As a result, belt grinding is replacing traditional grinding technologies {{in the field of}} the specialty metal processing.|$|R
