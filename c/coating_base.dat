5000|$|Once major {{structural}} treatments {{have been}} performed and the gesso layer stabilized, {{it is necessary to}} assess the bole layer of the frame. Bole is a mixture of colored clay, glue size, and fat, which is applied on the frame as a base coat for the gilding [...] Typically, the bole layer, which is either red or gray, is revealed in the points of contact of the frame where the gilding has worn off. The color of the bole layer must be closely matched to that of the original bole, as the bole affects the overall tone of the frame.It is essential to determine which gilding process was used before proceeding with the in-gilding process. The two common gilding processes are water gilding and oil gilding. The difference in the two processes is in adhesive <b>coating</b> <b>base.</b> Water gilding is the traditional, more difficult method, which must be cleaned using a mineral spirit or denatured alcohol. Oil gilding can be cleaned with a mild water based soap solution.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{explored}} the preparation {{technology of the}} use of compound materials as aluminum alloy spot welding electrode surface coating, in order to improve the electrode surface temperature strength and reduce electrode wear. The test results show that compound electrode coating of Cu-Ti-B is synthesized in situ at the Zr-Cr-Cu electrode surface by the resistance heat and pressure while spot welding. Structure and component analysis shows that it contains TiB 2 strips and grains with good heat resistance, which can intensify the strength of <b>coating</b> <b>base</b> and reduce the plastic deformation generated in part of the electrode surface by blasting right after the electrification. So it is feasible to prolong the electrode life of aluminum alloy spot welding...|$|E

40|$|High {{velocity}} oxy-fuel (HVOF) spraying of Diamalloy 1005 powders {{mixed with}} WC particles onto steel (304) is considered and laser re-melting {{of the resulting}} coatings is examined. Laser re-melting process is modeled to determine the melt layer thickness while temperature increase is formulated using the Fourier heating law. The morphological and metallurgical analyses prior and post laser re-melting process are carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique is {{used to determine the}} residual stress developed in the coating while the analytical formulation is adopted to predict the residual stress levels at the <b>coating</b> <b>base</b> material interface. The indentation tests are carried out to determine the Young’s modulus and fracture toughness of the coating prior to laser re-melting. Corrosion resistance of coating is measured using potentiodynamic polarization technique prior and post laser treatment process. The predictions of the melt layer thickness are in good agreement with experimental results. The presence of WC particles modifies temperature rise and its gradient in the coating while affecting the Young’s modulus, residual stress levels, and fracture toughness of the coating. The differences in the thermal properties of Inconel 625 powders and WC particles result in formation of small size cellular structure through polyphase solidification. WC dissolution in the central region of the large polycrystalline cells is observed due to the loss of carbon through carbonic gas formation. The results of corrosion tests prevail that significant improvement of corrosion resistance can be achieved after laser treatment process...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of aluminum (Al) mass fraction {{on the performance of}} an epoxy-lacquer <b>based</b> <b>coating.</b> The conductivity increased and IR emissivity and gloss decreased with increased Al mass fraction. When the Al mass fraction was decreased from 40 % to 30 %, the adhesion and impact strength of epoxy-lacquer based coatings increased and were grade 1 and 50 [*]Kg·cm, respectively. When the Al mass fraction was decreased to 10 %, the mechanical properties of epoxy-lacquer based coatings decreased. Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of coatings showed that epoxy-lacquer <b>based</b> <b>coating</b> with 30 % Al mass fraction has the best corrosion resistance and the lowest porosity. The epoxy-lacquer <b>based</b> <b>coating</b> with the best stability was that of 30 % Al mass fraction.
