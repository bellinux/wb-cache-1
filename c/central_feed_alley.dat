The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in three semi open free-stall barns (B 1, B 2, and B 3) for dairy cows with capacities for 120, 120 and 500 cows, respectively, from three different dairy farms (F- 1, F- 2 and F- 3), situated in Central Southern Bulgaria. The investigated farms had the same production system – loose housing in semi open free-stall dairy barn. For each of the farms the main microclimatic parameters – air temperature, relative humidity and speed of airflow were recorded twice a month at 10. 00 h 12. 00 h, 14. 00 h, 16. 00 h and 18. 00 h of the day inside the barns in three main technological zones - above the stalls, above manure and <b>feed</b> <b>alleys</b> and outside the buildings.

40|$|Twelve dairy herds with {{evidence}} of post-natal infection with Neospora caninum were compared with 21 control herds with no evidence of post-natal infection. On the former farms, dogs consumed placenta or licked uterine discharge in 75 and 67 % of the farms, respectively, while on control farms these activities occurred in 38 and 24 % of the farms, respectively. On all control farms and all but three post-natally infected farms the dogs were fed colostrum or milk. Defecation of dogs on the <b>feeding</b> <b>alley</b> was observed in 92 % of the post-natally infected farms and in 24 % of the control farms. The same trend was observed for defecation of dogs in grass silage, in 75 % of the post-natally infected farms and in 19 % of the control farms; and in corn silage, in 50 % of the post-natally infected farms and in 10 % of the control farms. Consumption of placenta, material of aborted foetuses or uterine discharge in combination with defecation on the <b>feeding</b> <b>alley,</b> storage of grass or corn silage was observed in 19 % of the control farms and in 75 % of the post-natally infected farms.

40|$|In modern dairy housing, {{flooring}} conditions lead to restricted locomotion and claw disorders. Epidemiological {{studies showed}} that housing on concrete floors {{was positively correlated with}} the incidence of lameness and claw disorders. Lameness and claw disorders constitute a significant health and welfare problem in modern dairy farming. Animals experience pain, are limited in their natural behaviour and can less easily meet their biological needs. The research in this thesis is focused on epidemiological and ethological aspects of claw disorders and disturbed locomotion with special emphasises on floor type and implications for animal welfare. The majority of the 1. 5 million dairy cows in The Netherlands are nowadays housed in cubicle houses with concrete stall floors. A small percentage of dairy cows are housed in straw yards. This housing system has a deep litter (straw-bedded) area where animals can rest collectively, accompanied by a concrete walking surface in front of the <b>feed</b> <b>alley.</b> At first, we investigated the claw health of more than 7500 dairy cows on different stall floors.

Fifty-one dairy farms with at least 70 Holstein milking cows and no access to pasture were selected from a list provided by the hoof trimmers from the Alberta Hoof Health Project. On these farms slipperiness and flooring type in the <b>feeding</b> <b>alley</b> and in the holding pen was recorded. Forty focal cows were gait scored (limping, head bob, asymmetric steps and tracking-up). In order to calculate odds ratios, farms were divided in groups: Farms with < 15 % of lame cows and farms with ≥ 15 % lame cows. Farms with < 25 % asymmetric cows and farms with ≥ 25 % asymmetric cows. Farms with < 60 % under-tracking cows and farms with ≥ 60 % under-tracking cows. Because of the small number of farms with other flooring than grooved concrete in the feeding area of the pen and in the holding pen, odds ratios could not be calculated.

40|$|AbstractLying {{behavior}} {{is an important}} measure of comfort and well-being in dairy cattle, and changes in lying behavior are potential indicators and predictors of lameness. Our objectives were to determine individual and herd-level risk factors associated with measures of lying behavior, and to evaluate whether automated measures of lying behavior {{can be used to}} detect lameness. A purposive sample of 40 Holstein cows was selected from each of 141 dairy farms in Alberta, Ontario, and Québec. Lying behavior of 5, 135 cows between 10 and 120 d in milk was automatically and continuously recorded using accelerometers over 4 d. Data on factors hypothesized to influence lying behavior were collected, including information on individual cows, management practices, and facility design. Associations between predictor variables and measures of lying behavior were assessed using generalized linear mixed models, including farm and province as random and fixed effects, respectively. Logistic regression models were used to determine whether lying behavior was associated with lameness. At the cow-level, daily lying time increased with increasing days in milk, but this effect interacted with parity; primiparous cows had more frequent but shorter lying bouts in early lactation, changing to mature-cow patterns of lying behavior (fewer and longer lying bouts) in late lactation. In barns with stall curbs > 22 cm high, the use of sand or > 2 cm of bedding was associated with an increased average daily lying time of 1. 44 and 0. 06 h/d, respectively. <b>Feed</b> <b>alleys</b> ≥ 350 cm wide or stalls ≥ 114 cm wide were associated with increased daily lying time of 0. 39 and 0. 33 h/d, respectively, whereas rubber flooring in the <b>feed</b> <b>alley</b> was associated with 0. 47 h/d lower average lying time. Lame cows had longer lying times, with fewer, longer, and more variable duration of bouts compared with nonlame cows. In that regard, cows with lying time ≥ 14 h/d, ≤ 5 lying bouts per day, bout duration ≥ 110 min/bout, or standard deviations of bout duration over 4 d ≥ 70 min had 3. 7, 1. 7, 2. 5, and 3. 0 higher odds of being lame, respectively. Factors related to comfort of lying and standing surfaces significantly affected lying behavior. Finally, we inferred that automated measures of lying behavior could contribute to lameness detection, especially when interpreted in the context of other factors known to affect lying behavior, including those associated with the individual cow (e. g., parity and stage of lactation) or environment (e. g., stall surface) ...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the causes}} that {{influence}} cow welfare, heat stress induced by microclimatic conditions {{is one of}} the most relevant and many studies have investigated the efficacy of different cooling systems on animal health status. Nevertheless, the direct influence of the cooling systems on possible modifications of dairy cow behaviour has been addressed in a few studies and the related results were affected by the presence of a paddock, which gave a refuge from hot temperature. Since an alteration of the daily time budget spent by dairy cows in their usual activities can be associated with changes in their health status, this study investigated the effects of the alternation of two different cooling systems on lying, standing, and feeding behaviour of a group of dairy cows bred in a free-stall dairy house where animals had no access to a paddock. The barn was equipped with a fogging system associated with forced ventilation installed in the resting area and a sprinkler system associated with forced ventilation installed in the feeding area. The two systems were activated alternately. The results demonstrated that the management of the two cooling systems affected the analysed behaviours.

40|$|Eight dairy herds with {{evidence}} of post-natal transmission of Neospora caninum were {{used to test the}} hypothesis of a point source exposure by a retrospective analysis of the housing and feeding of infected age-groups. The first N. caninum-associated abortion or birth of N. caninum-seropositive offspring from the post-natally infected age-group was considered as the first indication of the infection. In seven of the eight dairy herds, a point source exposure to N. caninum of the infected age-groups was found during a limited period of common housing and feeding. In all herds studied, the analysis indicated that the cattle had been infected shortly before the first abortions occurred. In all, except one herd, the post-natal infection was more directly related to housing than to feeding. Therefore, it appeared that the feed was contaminated in the <b>feeding</b> <b>alley.</b> In one herd, the total mixed ration was found to be the probable path of infection. In all farms studied, a new dog (young, adult dog or litter) had been introduced within a period of 1. 5 years prior to the first indication of N. caninum infection in the cattle. As there was evidence in all herds of vertical transmission of neosporosis for years, it is hypothesized that the newly introduced dog was infected with N. caninum by materials from already infected cattle and subsequently transmitted the infection to other cattle by shedding of oocysts.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} consistency in competitive success across 3 common resources available to dairy cows housed in free-stall barns. Specifically, we determined if those cows that displaced other cows most often at the feed bunk (high-ranking) had priority of access to free-stalls or a mechanical brush. Our secondary {{objective was to}} determine if the displacements at each resource were a function of usage of that resource. These objectives were tested using 6 groups of 12 lactating dairy cows housed in pens with 0. 6 m of bunk space per cow, 1 free-stall per cow, and 1 mechanical brush per pen. Time-lapse video was used to quantify the time spent feeding, in the stalls, and using the mechanical brush. The incidence of displacements at the <b>feed</b> <b>alley</b> and lying area was measured for 3 d consecutively. Usage was lower for the brush, so displacements were monitored for 14 d consecutively. The individual measures of competitive success were not highly correlated between resources indicating a cow that frequently displaced other cows for access to one particular resource did not always do so when accessing the other resources. Competition at the feeder was responsible for 87. 6 +/- 1. 4 % of displacements observed throughout the experiment, indicating that gaining access to feed was a high priority for cows. These results suggest that competitive success by dairy cows may vary according to each cow's motivation to access the resource...|$|R
