60|$|That {{the said}} Warren Hastings first {{engaged in a}} scheme to export one {{thousand}} four hundred and sixty chests of opium, on the Company's account, on board a ship belonging to Cudbert Thornhill, half of {{which was to be}} disposed of in a coasting voyage, and the remainder in Canton. That, besides the freight and <b>commission</b> <b>payable</b> to the said Thornhill on this adventure, twelve pieces of cannon belonging to the Company were lent for arming the ship; though his original proposal was, that the ship should be armed at his expense. That this part of the adventure, depending for its success on a prudent and fortunate management of various sales and resales {{in the course of a}} circuitous voyage, and being exposed to such risk both of sea and enemy that all private traders had declined to be concerned in it, was particularly unfit for a great trading company, and could not be undertaken on their account with any rational prospect of advantage.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{substantial}} {{performance by the}} agent where, for example, the principal instructs the agent to sell land, and the agent sells the land to a person prohibited by law from purchasing it. In such a case, the agent is not entitled to any remuneration. Nor is the agent entitled to commission where the principal is willing to sell the property for a fixed sum, free of commission, and the agent sells the property for the fixed sum only. In the case of estate agents, the usual agreement is that the agent is entitled to commission if the principal actually enters into a contract with a person introduced by the agent. An agent cannot claim commission for the mere introduction of a person {{willing and able to}} contract on the principal’s terms, unless an agreement to that effect is proved. In the case of a mandate “to find a purchaser,” the agent’s <b>commission</b> is usually <b>payable</b> on completion of a valid sale.|$|R
