40|$|Camera {{calibration}} {{is essential}} for many computer vision and image processing applications. However, this calibration process can be rather time consuming and may require {{a significant amount of}} human intervention. Calibration models traditionally employ a <b>calibration</b> <b>grid</b> whose four corner points must be marked by hand on a per-frame basis. The objective of this work is to develop a technique for processing these frames rapidly, with as little human intervention as possible. We propose an algorithm to extract the boundaries of the <b>calibration</b> <b>grid</b> automatically, based on a spectral analysis of HD (high-definition) video frames. The accuracy of the intrinsic parameters estimated using our automatic method is evaluated through comparison with those obtained using a method that requires hand labeling of the corner points.

40|$|A generic {{imaging model}} {{refers to a}} {{non-parametric}} camera model where every camera is treated {{as a set of}} unconstrained projection rays. Calibration would simply be a method to map the projection rays to image pixels; such a mapping can be computed using plane based <b>calibration</b> <b>grids.</b> However, existing algorithms for generic calibration use more point correspondences than the theoretical minimum. It has been well-established that non-minimal solutions for calibration and structure-from-motion algorithms are generally noise-prone compared to minimal solutions.

Our algorithms for generally central cameras use 4 point correspondences in three <b>calibration</b> <b>grids</b> to compute the motion between the grids.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} unified theory for {{calibrating}} {{a wide variety}} of camera models such as pinhole, fisheye, cata-dioptric, and multi-camera networks. We model any camera as a set of image pixels and their associated camera rays in space. Every pixel measures the light traveling along a (half-) ray in 3 -space, associated with that pixel. By this definition, calibration simply refers to the computation of the mapping between pixels and the associated 3 D rays. Such a mapping can be computed using images of <b>calibration</b> <b>grids,</b> which are objects with known 3 D geometry, taken from unknown positions. This general camera model allows to represent non-central cameras; we also consider two special subclasses, namely central and axial cameras. In a central camera, all rays intersect in a single point, whereas the rays are completely arbitrary in a non-central one. Axial cameras are an intermediate case: the camera rays intersect a single line. In this work, we show the theory for calibrating central, axial and non-central models using <b>calibration</b> <b>grids,</b> which can be either three-dimensional or planar...|$|R

40|$|Imaging systems {{consisting}} of a camera looking at multiple spherical mirrors (reflection) or multiple refractive spheres (refraction) {{have been used for}} wide-angle imaging applications. We describe such setups as multi-axial imaging systems, since a single sphere results in an axial system. Assuming an internally calibrated camera, calibration of such multi-axial systems involves estimating the sphere radii and locations in the camera coordinate system. However, previous calibration approaches require manual intervention or constrained setups. We present a fully automatic approach using a single photo of a 2 D <b>calibration</b> <b>grid.</b> The pose of the <b>calibration</b> <b>grid</b> is assumed to be unknown and is also recovered. Our approach can handle unconstrained setups, where the mirrors/refractive balls can be arranged in any fashion, not necessarily on a grid. The axial nature of rays allows us to compute the axis of each sphere separately. We then show that by choosing rays from two or more spheres, the unknown pose of the <b>calibration</b> <b>grid</b> can be obtained linearly and independently of sphere radii and locations. Knowing the pose, we derive analytical solutions for obtaining the sphere radius and location. This leads to an interesting result that 6 -DOF pose estimation of a multi-axial camera can be done without the knowledge of full calibration. Simulations and real experiments demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm. 1...|$|E

Furthermore, quartz actuators {{in the form of}} a tuning fork have the advantage of yielding static displacements comparable to those of local probe microscope scanners. We use the static displacement of a quartz tuning fork as a reference to calibrate the three axis displacement of a ceramic piezoelectric scanner.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present two novel techniques, namely a local {{unwarping}} polynomial (LUP) and a hierarchical radial basis function (HRBF) network, to correct geometric distortions in XRII images. The two techniques {{have been implemented}} and compared, in terms of residual error measured at control and intermediate points, with local and global methods reported in the previous literature. In particular, LUP rests on a locally optimized 3 rd degree polynomial applied within each quadrilateral cell on the rectilinear <b>calibration</b> <b>grid</b> of points. HRBF, based on a feed-forward neural network paradigm, is constituted {{by a set of}} hierarchical layers at increasing cut-off frequency, each characterized by a set of Gaussian functions. Extensive experiments have been performed both on simulated and real data. In simulation, we tested the effect of pincushion, sigmoidal and local distortions, along with the number of calibration points. Provided that a sufficient number of cells of the <b>calibration</b> <b>grid</b> is available, the obtained accuracy for both LUP and HRBF is comparable to or better than that of global polynomial technique. Tests on real data, carried out by using two different (12 in. and 16 in.) XRIIs, showed that the global polynomial accuracy (0. 16 ±. 08 pixels) is slightly worse than that of LUP (0. 07 ± 0. 05 pixels) and HRBF (0. 08 ± 0. 04 pixels). The effects of the discontinuity at the border of the local areas and the decreased accuracy at intermediate points, typical of local techniques, have been proved to be smoothed for both LUP and HRBF. © 2002 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES. To {{develop a}} new {{automated}} calibration method for vessel measurements in vascular x-ray images. METHODS. Radiopaque marker bands mounted equidistantly on a small catheter were acquired in vitro at five image intensifier (II) sizes in x-ray projection images. The positions of the marker centers were detected by using a Hough transform and were computed at subpixel precision by using either a novel, iterative center-of-gravity approach (CGA) or a symmetry filter. Curve-fitting procedures were used to reject false-positive marker detections and to calculate intermarker distances. The calibration factor was calculated from the true marker distance and {{the average of the}} measured distances in pixels. Results were compared statistically with a <b>grid</b> <b>calibration</b> method, which was taken as the gold standard. A simulation study was performed to assess the influence of image noise on the CGA method. RESULTS. The iterative CGA method was convergent and faster than the symmetry-based technique. For four II sizes (17, 20, 25, and 31 cm), the results from the CGA method were not significantly different from the results obtained with <b>grid</b> <b>calibration.</b> For the II size of 38 cm, a significant difference (0. 3 % of the <b>grid</b> <b>calibration</b> factor) was found; however, this was caused by the quantification error in the image data and was not clinically relevant. In general, the performance of the CGA method improved with increasing signal-to-noise ratio. CONCLUSIONS.

40|$|Array antennas have a {{wide range}} of {{applications}} which includes ground and airborne radar, weather radar and anti-collision radar. In addition, equally important applications exist for communications, both on earth and to satellites in space, as well as for medical applications such as the detection and treatment of tumors. The modern trend in array design is to use digital beamforming and to integrate the antennas {{with the rest of the}} system more closely. This adds new possibilities, but also contributes to make the system expensive. To make full use of the new technology, this thesis presents a direction dependent signal processing array calibration method. The new method, called local calibration, also allows for larger array imperfections and, possibly, a lower overall array cost. In contrast to other non-parametric calibration methods, the proposed method can handle position errors and shows good performance also for sparse <b>calibration</b> <b>grids,</b> which is demonstrated by high resolution direction of arrival estimation. The local calibration has also been included in a convex beampattern optimization, which makes it possible to achieve a uniform sidelobe level also with unknown sensor position errors in the array. The embedded element pattern is included in the optimization by extracting the direction dependence of the received power from the calibration. Another application for the local calibration method is to reduce the number of necessary calibration measurements by calculating pseudo calibration data from a sparse <b>grid</b> of measured <b>calibration</b> data. Array signal processing is often performed assuming Uniform Linear Arrays (ULAs), although this model is far too simple to reveal the true behavior of array antennas. Throughout this thesis, more realistic models including mutual coupling and array imperfections are used. Specifically, the impact of mutual coupling and position errors on the adaptive beamforming performance in linear and circular arrays is studied. In the studied cases, the circular array is found to be more sensitive to neglecting the mutual coupling. Robust adaptive methods are commonly used to handle model uncertainties, such as unknown mutual coupling, but even better performance can be achieved if these methods are combined with a calibration...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} proven that DMC images (as images of other digital aerial cameras) are not free of {{systematic}} errors in the virtual image space. Not properly modelled estimated exterior orientation can absorb propagated errors in the bundle block adjustment (from different errors sources as image systematic errors, poor GPS/INS observations or insufficient ground control points set up) and could generate unwanted large systematic errors in the object space, especially in height. To keep error propagation under control two different approaches are considered in bundle adjustment: i) an appropriate set of self-calibration parameters and ii) calibration/characterisation grid, compensating image systematic errors in each virtual image. The <b>calibration</b> <b>grid</b> is derived from a calibration flight and should be valid for images acquired in other projects. This paper focuses on two topics: firstly a comparison between the performance of both approximations in aerotriangulation, and, secondly, {{the impact of these}} systematic errors on stereoplotting. The first analysis uses seven different data sets (including the calibration flight) and three bundle adjustment set ups: i) not using any model at all, ii) using a self-calibration parameter set, and iii) using the calibration gird without using any self-calibration parameter set. Independent check points are used to assess the performance of both techniques in bundle adjustment. In the second analysis object coordinates for points of single models are calculated compensating and also not compensating for systematic errors their image coordinates. Later, these two sets of points are compared to the respective estimated object coordinates of the bundle adjustment.

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of force measurements with atomic force microscopy (AFM) on materials with a few surface contacts/asperities and chemically modified surfaces. The technique allows measurements of ultra-small intermolecular and surface forces, down to the piconewton level. The force measurements between surfaces of well-defined geometry are often used to measure and model the interaction between different systems of charged and neutral surfaces in various environments. However, detailed knowledge of the contacting surface profile geometry and surface properties is required to model the fundamental forces involved in the interaction. The preparation of such well-defined and idealized surfaces is often time consuming and the surfaces may not possess the behavior and properties of a source material in real processes, such as in industry. Moreover, external factors such as magnetic fields, ionic strengths and pH-values in a solution, may further complicate the evaluation. Hence, it is desirable to explore and develop techniques for trustable measurements of forces between “real” surfaces. These are often a complex composition of various force interactions and multiple surface contacts. The AFM probe technique was explored to measure force interactions between “real” particle surfaces. The work shows {{the applicability of the}} AFM technique to study the interaction forces despite the forecasted difficulties with the roughness of the particles. A technique to measure the adhesion and work of adhesion from AFM force curves was implemented and used. The thermal tune method was implemented in our commercial NT-MDT microscope to determine cantilever spring constants. The force interactions between natural microsize (m-s) magnetite particles and synthetic nanosize (n-s) magnetite particles were studied in calcium solution with concentrations of 1, 10, 100 mM and at pH values 4, 6 and 10. The changes in force interactions, due to variations in calcium concentration and pH were investigated. The adhesion force change with the concentration and pH was similar for m-s/m-s and m-s/n-s systems, and the adhesion force increased with the concentration at pH 6, except for the highest calcium concentration of 100 mM at pH 10. It was found that the magnetite surface modification could appear at the highest calcium concentration at pH 10. Moreover, the thesis contains preliminary results of the force interaction study between natural and synthetic bentonite-magnetite particles in calcium solution with concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 mM at pH 6. The influence of roughness on the calculation of contact mechanics parameters were studied with AFM and Vertical Scanning Interferometry (VSI). This is important for future development of a model to describe and characterize the force interaction between samples with multiple surface contacts. It was found that the optical artifacts, induced by VSI, have a large influence on all the roughness parameters calculated on the <b>calibration</b> <b>grids,</b> which represent extreme surface topographies.

40|$|A marine {{ecosystem}} model, {{that had previously}} been calibrated in a one-dimensional (1 D) mode against observations at three time-series and process-study sites simultaneously, is coupled to a three-dimensional (3 D) circulation model of the North and Equatorial Atlantic. Compared to an experiment with a previously employed subjectively tuned ecosystem model, the new 3 D-model does not only reduce the model-data misfit at those locations at which observations entered the 1 D optimization procedure, but also at an oligotrophic site in the subtropics that had not been considered in the 1 D <b>calibration.</b> Basin-scale <b>gridded</b> climatological data sets of nitrate, surface chlorophyll, and satellite-derived primary production also reveal a generally lower model-data misfit for the optimized model. The most significant improvement is found in terms of simulated primary production: on average, primary production is about 2. 5 times higher in the optimized model which primarily results from the inclusion of a phytoplankton recycling pathway back to dissolved inorganic nitrogen. This recycling pathway also allows for a successful reproduction of nonvanishing surface nitrate concentrations over large parts of the subpolar North Atlantic. Apart from primary production, the parameter optimization reduces root-mean-square misfits by merely 10 – 25 % and remaining misfits are still much larger than observational error estimates. These residual misfits can be attributed both to errors in the physical model component and to errors {{in the structure of the}} ecosystem model, which an objective estimation of ecosystem model parameters by data assimilation alone cannot resolve...|$|R
