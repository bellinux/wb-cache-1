2500|$|In 1951, E. W. Kettering wrote a {{paper for}} the ASME entitled, History and Development of the 567 Series General Motors Locomotive Engine, which goes into great {{detail about the}} {{technical}} obstacles that were encountered during {{the development of the}} 567 engine (these same considerations apply to the 645 and 710). The 567's designers started with a tabula rasa,"In time most of the early bugs were cleaned up, but it was becoming more evident that to make a substantial gain in the durability of the 201A engine a major redesign would be in order. The diesel locomotive was rapidly proving itself and to the more optimistic it looked like {{it was going to be}} a good business, so it was decided that the engine would be redesigned for railroad use only. The design would not be handicapped by requirements for marine, Navy, or stationary application. Most of the Winton experimental design group moved to Detroit where the redesign was to be made. After settling in Detroit we took a large piece of paper and on one side wrote down all of the troubles which were known in the 201A engine at that time. On the other side we were going to write down parts of the engine which had been satisfactory. These items were based on the four years experience in the field and the test work at Winton and General Motors Research. It did not take long to fill in one side of the sheet. In fact, the more we looked into what we could salvage of the 201A design to correct all of these troubles the more apparent it was that we should start with a clean piece of paper and forget the 201A." [...] systematically eliminating each of the 201A's many deficiencies which were preventing the earlier design from becoming successful in freight service, although the 201A was relatively successful in the less-demanding passenger and switching services. The 567 design had nothing in common with the 201A except the two-stroke cycle itself: each and every component of the 201A was replaced with a new design, even the [...] "dipstick", to paraphrase one of Kettering's off-handed comments. The 567 proved to be exceptionally successful in passenger, switching, freight, marine and stationary services, and, counting its two successors, the 645 and 710, which are not materially different from the 567 (all have the same external dimensions, differing mainly in per <b>cylinder</b> <b>displacement),</b> collectively have given nearly 80 years of exceptionally reliable service to those applications. As but one example of the achievements of the tabula rasa design: whereas the Winton 201A was doing very well with a [...] piston lifetime, the 567 immediately achieved a [...] piston lifetime, and in at least one case, reached a [...] piston lifetime, a 10:1 to 20:1 improvement."A brief comparison can be drawn as to life of pistons in passenger service. These comparisons must be based on passenger operation as there never were any 201As in any other service than passenger and switcher. The 201A aluminum piston at the very beginning did not run 50,000 miles and the later 201A pistons ran a questionable 100,000 miles in hard service. The average life of the first 567 piston was in the range of 400,000 to 500,000. On one major railroad the average life of the current design two-piece piston is at least one million miles (Fig. 24)." ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. : The {{effect of}} {{infantile}} nystagmus syndrome (INS) on {{the efficiency of}} goal-directed hand movements was examined.

The first 10 movements of 20 back-and-forth displacements in a trial were performed between two visually presented target areas, and the second 10 between remembered target locations (not visible). Motor performance was examined in terms of movement time, endpoint accuracy, and a harmonicity index reflecting energetic efficiency. Results. : Compared to the control group, the children with INS performed the <b>cylinder</b> <b>displacements</b> more slowly (using more time), less accurately (specifically in small-amplitude movements), and with less harmonic acceleration profiles. Their poor visual acuity proved to correlate with slower and less accurate movements, but did not correlate with harmonicity.

In both groups, movement speed and harmonicity increased with age to a similar extent.

5000|$|The Detroit Diesel Series 51 was a {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engine}} built by General Motors, Detroit Diesel Division from 1951 to 1959. Unlike other GM/Detroit Diesel engines, the 51 series designation did {{not refer to}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>displacement,</b> but rather to the year it was introduced. Two versions were produced, an inline two-cylinder (2-51, 108 cid L) and an inline four-cylinder model (4-51, 216 cid L). It was a simplified version of the Series 53 {{that did not have}} exhaust valves. This was accomplished by using loop scavenging ports for both intake and exhaust along with a mechanical blower. This engine used a dry sleeve with 9 intake ports and three exhaust ports in that sleeve. These sleeves were located {{in such a way that}} the exhaust ports lined up with exhaust ports in the block that were physically higher than the intake ports in the block. This resulted in pressurized cool air being forced through the intake ports just after the exhaust started exiting (note that the exhaust ports in the sleeves were higher at the top than the intake ports while the bottom of all ports in the sleeve are at the same height. The net compression ratio is 18:1. Unlike a two cycle gasoline engine, the crankcase was not used to draw in the fuel/air mixture. Instead, the blower forced air in the intake ports and fuel was injected by a camshaft actuated injector which was pressurized by a gear pump. As fuel is injected just before top dead center, little unburned fuel is expelled in the exhaust, unlike a two-cycle gasoline engine. The elimination of exhaust valves reduced the complexity and weight of the engine. The power output and RPM of this engine was controlled by governing the intake air and controlling the opening of the injectors with shutdown accomplished by completely closing off the air intake. The much lower weight of this engine compared to engines with valves made it quite suitable for applications where other engines of the same horsepower were not feasible. Its uses include: Marine propulsion, generators, pumps, air compressors, road graders and other industrial uses. It was never factory installed for automotive purposes but conversion kits and engines were made available for automotive use. This engine design did not see widespread use due to not being able to reduce the exhaust noise to an acceptable level, as any exhaust restriction would have resulted in a reduction of power and efficiency. It was a very fuel efficient engine with a high power output to fuel consumption ratio.|$|E
