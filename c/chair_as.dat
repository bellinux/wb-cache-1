5|$|Although Hogg spent {{little time}} at the Varner {{plantation}} after Bayou Bend was constructed, she continued to purchase art and antique furniture on its behalf. In the 1950s, she restored the plantation, and each room was given a different theme from Texas history: colonial times, the Confederacy, Napoleonic times (1818), and the Mexican–American War. One room was dedicated to her father, and contained his desk and <b>chair</b> <b>as</b> well as his collection of walking sticks. She donated the property to the state, and it was dedicated as the Varner–Hogg Plantation State Historical Site in 1958, the 107th anniversary of Jim Hogg's birth.|$|E

5|$|On April 15, 2009, Ziggler {{was drafted}} to the SmackDown brand {{as part of}} the 2009 Supplemental Draft. He made his debut on the April 17 episode of SmackDown, {{defeating}} the United States Champion, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a non-title match, and, as a result, the following week he demanded a match for the championship. On the May 1 episode of SmackDown, however, he failed to win the championship, after he was pinned by MVP. Ziggler then started a rivalry with The Great Khali, losing to him by disqualification after attacking Khali with a steel <b>chair.</b> <b>As</b> a result, Khali began coming out to the ring during and after Ziggler's matches, in attempt to gain revenge and to stop Ziggler from cheating. Over the next few weeks, Ziggler defeated Khali by countout and disqualification after making it look like Khali had struck him with a steel chair. At The Bash pay-per-view, Ziggler defeated Khali by pinfall, after Kane interfered and attacked Khali.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} from SmackDown was the event's final match, in which Batista defended the World Heavyweight Championship against The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match. At one point, Batista {{performed}} a Batista Bomb through a table on Undertaker for a near-fall. The Undertaker then performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Batista for a near-fall. The Undertaker then performed another Tombstone Piledriver {{on top of}} the steel steps and pinned Batista, but as the referee counted the pin, Edge, dressed as a cameraman, pulled the referee out of the ring, and hit The Undertaker with the camera he was holding and then positioned Undertaker's head {{on top of the}} steel steps. Edge then slammed a folding chair onto The Undertaker's head. While the referee re-entered the ring, Edge dragged Batista onto The Undertaker, and as a result, Batista pinned The Undertaker to retain the World Heavyweight Title. After the match, Edge came back into the ring and hit The Undertaker with a <b>chair</b> <b>as</b> he was sitting up.|$|E
5|$|At Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000, The Rock {{entered the}} Royal Rumble match {{and was one}} of the final two remaining, along with Big Show; Show {{seemingly}} intended to throw The Rock over the top rope in a running powerslam-like position, but Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before re-entering the ring as the winner. However, The Rock's feet hit the floor first, although those watching the event on TV did not see that, until Big Show proved this with additional video footage, and claimed to be the rightful winner. Despite this proof, the original decision could not be reversed, so a number one contender's match for the WWF Championship was held at No Way Out, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered and hit The Rock in the head with a steel <b>chair</b> <b>as</b> he attempted to execute a People's Elbow. The Rock defeated Big Show on March 13 episode of Raw Is War to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 in a fatal four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley. Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife, Stephanie, Foley had Linda, The Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane. Triple H retained the title after Vince betrayed The Rock by hitting him with a chair.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a singles match in which WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin defended against the Undertaker. Originally, Shane and Vince McMahon were {{supposed}} to be the guest referees, but due to storyline purposes, Pat Patterson, an accomplice of Vince McMahon, replaced Vince, who had had his ankle broken earlier in the event, in order to prevent Shane from helping The Undertaker. Patterson, however, was unable to officiate the entire match after the Undertaker executed a chokeslam on him. The Undertaker and Austin wrestled inconclusively until Austin hit The Undertaker on the head with a folding <b>chair.</b> <b>As</b> Austin went to cover the Undertaker, Gerald Brisco, another accomplice of Vince, came down to the ring to replace Patterson and officiated the unsuccessful pinfall attempt by Austin. Like his partner Patterson, Brisco was unable to officiate the entire match after the Undertaker attacked him. Vince then came down to the ring as another referee replacement, but when Austin forcefully pulled the Undertaker's head over his shoulders to perform a stunner, Shane prevented him from performing a three count. As Vince and Shane argued, Austin got up and confronted Vince, at which point Shane shoved Vince into Austin, who fell into a roll-up by The Undertaker, and then performed a fast count to give him the victory and the WWF Title.|$|E
5|$|The seventh {{match of}} the show pitted Jeff Jarrett against Kurt Angle, with Mick Foley serving as the Special Ringside Enforcer. Jarrett gained a near-fall in the contest when he suplexed Angle {{off the top of}} a turnbuckle. Jarrett then placed Angle in a Figure-Four Leglock {{submission}} hold, which was broken by the referee when Angle grabbed the bottom rope. Angle fought back with a series of consecutive German suplexes, forcing Jarrett against the mat back-first. He then placed Jarrett in his signature Ankle lock submission hold, which Jarrett fought Angle to get released. Angle gained a near-fall by slamming Jarrett back-first against the mat with his signature Olympic Slam maneuver. Afterwards, Angle missed an areial splash from the top of a turnbuckle, when Jarrett moved out of the way. Angle then accidentally hit the referee, knocking him out in the storyline. Jarrett followed by performing his signature Stroke maneuver on Angle, with Foley counting the pinfall attempt before Angle kicked out. Afterwards, Angle hit Jarrett in the groin and then attacked Foley with a steel chair at ringside, before returning to the ring to hit Jarrett with the <b>chair</b> <b>as</b> well. Angle then revived the referee who counted Angle's pinfall attempt before Foley stopped the count by pulling the referee from the ring. Foley then attacked Angle and applied his signature Mandible Claw submission hold. Jarrett followed up by bashing a guitar over Angle's head and covering for a pinfall that Foley counted to win the match at 20 minutes and 7 seconds.|$|E
