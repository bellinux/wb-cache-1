Furthermore, the work deals with the identification of preventive measures, which would reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of economic cycles. Recommendations by representatives of the Austrian School are described as difficult to implement on the basis of number of arguments. In the work are therefore proposed more realistic measures to limit the volatility of the economic cycle, which emanate mainly from the <b>composite</b> <b>price</b> <b>index,</b> which {{is the subject of this}} text. The index reflects the price development in all stages of production and should therefore in monetary policy matters replace the current use of price indicators, based on the inflated scale of consumption, taking into account only minimal effects of monetary expansion.

40|$|Currently, {{the world}} {{economic}} activity is increasingly linked and dependent on each other. Almost all states interact {{with the outside world}} (Husnan 2001). It {{can be seen from the}} incident of monetary crisis that hit Asia in 1997. The post-crisis had created many agreements and efforts that led to the establishment of the institution on multilateral cooperation in the field of economy which was expected to improve understanding on the impact of regional economic integration formed through the combination of East Asia Summit (ASEAN, the People's Republic of China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Australia, India, and New Zealand) or better known as ASEAN+ 6. The effect of Indonesia economic relations with other countries renders Indonesia capital market integrated. Consequently, the effect can be positive or negative. The correlation of long term <b>composite</b> stock <b>price</b> <b>index</b> in the capital market among countries is used to determine the level and the development of capital market integration. <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) is an important variable in the financial sector whose fluctuation is worth to note from time to time. This index includes the movement of the composite index of all shares listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI). Sectoral Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) index is a sub index of the <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG), in which the volatile movement of the sectoral stock <b>price</b> <b>index</b> determines the movement of <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG). This research aims to analyze the relation between long-term integration and the impact of ASEAN+ 6 stock market shock on Indonesia <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) and to identify the industrial sector that has the most influence on the movement of the Indonesia <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) as well as the effect of industrial shock, and to provide input regarding managerial implication that can be taken by the investors. The scope of this study includes the ASEAN+ 6 countries, namely Indonesia (JKSE), Malaysia (KLSE), Singapore (STI), Thailand (SET), Philippines (PSEi), Australia (AORD), the People's Republic of China (SSE), Japan (Nikkei 225), Republic of Korea (Kospi), India (BSESN), and New Zealand (NZX 50). Sectoral stock <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> used include agriculture (JKAGRI), mining (JKMING), chemical and basic industries (JKBIND), various industries (JKMISC), consumer goods (JKCONS), property and real estate (JKPROP), transportation and infrastructure (JKINFA), finance (JKFINA), trade, services, investment (JKTRADE) and manufacturing (JKMNFG). The method used in this study is VAR / VECM. The result shows that stock <b>price</b> <b>index</b> Philippines, Republic of Korea and India positively related to <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) Indonesia, while Singapore, New Zealand, and Republic of China negatively related to the <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) Indonesia. Malaysia stock <b>price</b> <b>index,</b> Japan, Singapura and Australia has no influence on <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG). The shocks on stock <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> of Philippines, Republic of Korea, and India lead to the rise of JKSE in the long term, while the shocks on stock <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> of SET, NZXX 50 and SSE impact to the decline of JKSE in the long term, while the shocks on stock <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> of Thailand, New Zealand, and Republic of China impact to the decline of <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) in the long term. The most affecting Industrial sectors to the movement of the Indonesia <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) are the transportation and infrastructure, financial, basic industries and chemical, manufacturing sector, the sector of various industries, consumer goods industry and the mining sector. The shocks on basic and chemical industries as well as various industries lead to the increase of Indonesia <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) in the long term, while the shocks on financial sector, manufacturing, consumer goods industry, transportation, infrastructure, and the mining sector impact to decline of Indonesia <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) in the long term. It is suggested for the investors who invest in the Stock Exchange (BEI) to observe the movement of the stock <b>price</b> <b>index</b> of Philippines (PSEit), the stock <b>price</b> <b>index</b> of Republic of Korea (Kospi) and stock <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> of India (BSESN) as references or considerations for investment decisions because the research results suggest that the <b>composite</b> stock <b>price</b> <b>index</b> of those countries positively correlate with IHSG. The industrial sectors which can be served as stock investment alternatives are manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure, and mining industries because these sectors have positive influences on the movement of the Indonesia <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG). This indicates that at the time the <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) rises, investors can sell the shares of manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure and mining sectors. In the other hand, during the <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) rises, financial sector, basic industry and chemicals, various industries and consumer goods industries can serve as alternatives for stock purchase as the result of this research suggests those sectoral <b>price</b> <b>indices</b> negatively correlate with <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG). 	Investors from Indonesia may invest in Malaysia, Japan, Singapore and Australia as the results using VECM test display zero influence on Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) Indonesia which indicates that the degree of those countries stock index integration with the Indonesia <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) is low. A low degree of integration provides potential an opportunity benefit of international portfolio diversification. Market players must also consider the implications of the stock market integration which will affect the prospects of investment especially the domestic. The Indonesian government can take some steps to further develop the industrial sector such as manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure and mining because these sectors have positive influences on the movement of the <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) as well as to pay attention to the stock price shocks on the financial, manufacturing, consumer goods industry, transportation, infrastructure, and mining sectors as they impact to decline of Indonesia <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) in the long term...|$|R

40|$|We lay {{out here}} {{the basis for}} a {{long-term}} equity index model, with intent to extract the risk premium. This is done by first observing the behaviours of the S&P <b>Composite</b> <b>price</b> <b>index,</b> earnings and dividends over roughly 130 years of history, from 1871 to 1998, and then assessing whether they fit within an equilibrium and efficient-market framework. The notions of equilibrium and efficiency shall be defined and formalised here, as they relate to this work, using classical finance theory. The conclusions derived so far are twofold. First, there is a transition in the market’s behaviour at around 1945. It appears that prior to this, the dividend payment policy was, on aggregate, one of constant dividend yield. After this, the policy’s focus seems to have shifted towards achieving market equilibrium and efficiency. Second, the backward-looking risk premium during the post-transition period is found, in theory, to be simply the negative percent rate of change in dividend yield. Moreover, under the special-case scenario where the equity price is discounted at a constant “infinitehorizon” discount rate, the forward-looking risk premium becomes identically the dividend yield. ...|$|E

These strategies are based on examination of conditional moment profiles corresponding to certain shocks; a conditional moment profile is the conditional expectation evaluated at time t of a time invariant function evaluated at time t + j regarded {{as a function of}} j. The first method, which compares conditional moment profiles to baseline profiles, is the nonlinear analog of conventional impulse-response analysis. The second assesses the significance of a profile by comparing its sup-norm confidence band to a null profile. The third examines profile bundles for evidence of damping or persistence. Experimental designs for choosing an appropriate set of shocks are discussed. These methods are applied to a bivariate series comprised of daily changes in the Standard and Poor's <b>composite</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> and daily NYSE transactions volume from 1928 to 1987. The findings from these data are: (i) The multi-step ahead conditional volatility profile exhibits a symmetric response to both positive and negative price shocks. In contrast, the conditional volatility profile of the univariate price change process exhibits an asymmetric reeponse. (ii) The one-step ahead response of volume to price shocks is different than the multl-~tepahead response. Price shocks produce an increase in volume one-step ahead but decrease it in subsequent steps.

40|$|We propose estimators for the {{parameters}} of a linear median regression without any assumption on {{the shape of the}} error distribution – including no condition on the existence of moments – allowing for heterogeneity (or heteroskedasticity) of unknown form, noncontinuous distributions, and very general serial dependence (linear or nonlinear) including GARCH-type and stochastic volatility of unknown order. The estimators follow from a reverse inference approach, based on the class of distribution-free sign tests proposed in Coudin and Dufour (2009, Econometrics J.) under a mediangale assumption. As a result, the estimators inherit strong robustness properties from their generating tests. Since the proposed estimators are based on maximizing a test statistic (or a p-value function) over different null hypotheses, they can be interpreted as Hodges-Lehmann-type (HL) estimators. It is easy to adapt the sign-based estimators to account for linear serial dependence. Both finite-sample and large-sample properties are established under weak regularity conditions. The proposed estimators are median unbiased (under symmetry and estimator unicity) and satisfy natural equivariance properties. Consistency and asymptotic normality are established without any condition on error moment existence, allowing for heterogeneity (or heteroskedasticity) of unknown form, noncontinuous distributions, and very general serial dependence (linear or nonlinear). These conditions are considerably weaker than those used to show corresponding results for LAD estimators. In a Monte Carlo study on bias and mean square error, we find that sign-based estimators perform better than LAD-type estimators, especially in heteroskedastic settings. The proposed procedures are applied to a trend model of the Standard and Poor’s <b>composite</b> <b>price</b> <b>index,</b> where disturbances are affected by both heavy tails (non-normality) and heteroskedasticity. sign test, median regression, Hodges-Lehmann estimator, p-value; least absolute deviations, quantile regression; simultaneous inference, Monte Carlo tests, projection methods, nonnormality, heteroskedasticity; serial dependence; GARCH; stochastic volatility.,...|$|E

We focus on the development of simulation-based exact procedures-whose level can be controlled in finite samples-as well as on large-sample procedures which remain valid under non-regular conditions. We consider Wald-type, score-type and likelihood-ratio-type tests based on a simple moment estimator, which can be easily simulated. We also propose a C([alpha]) -type test which is very easy to implement and exhibits relatively good size and power properties. Besides usual linear restrictions on the SV model coefficients, the problems studied include testing homoskedasticity against a SV alternative (which involves singular moment conditions under the null hypothesis) and testing the null hypothesis of one factor driving the dynamics of the volatility process against two factors (which raises identification difficulties). Three ways of implementing the tests based on alternative statistics are compared: asymptotic critical values (when available), a local Monte Carlo (or parametric bootstrap) test procedure, and a maximized Monte Carlo (MMC) procedure. The size and power properties of the proposed tests are examined in a simulation experiment. The results indicate that the C([alpha]) -based tests (built upon the simple moment estimator available in closed form) have good size and power properties for regular hypotheses, while Monte Carlo tests are much more reliable than those based on asymptotic critical values. Further, in cases where the parametric bootstrap appears to fail (for example, in the presence of identification problems), the MMC procedure easily controls the level of the tests. Moreover, MMC-based tests exhibit relatively good power performance despite the conservative feature of the procedure.

To see {{the development of the}} Indonesian capital market is one indicator that is often used is the <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG), {{which is one of the}} stock market index used by the Bursa Efek Indonesia (BEI). The analytical tool used in this study is multiple linier regession with <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) as the dependent variable and four independent variabel are the variable exchange rate rupiah, the rate of 1 month SBI interest rate, inflation and money supply (M 2). After being tested deviations classical assumptions, the result indicate normally distributed data and not obtained an aberration. Based on the calculation results obtained value Eviews 6 count F= 264. 7399 with a significance F of 0. 000. By using the 0, 05 significance level obtained value of F table 2. 44. Then count F (264. 7399) > F table (2. 44), or significanceof F 0, 000 indicates less than 0, 05 so it can be concluded that the four independent variables namely the exchange rate rupiah, the rate of 1 month, inflation, and money supply (M 2) jointly affect the accepted the <b>Composite</b> Stock <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (IHSG) in Bursa Efek Indonesia (BEI) is accepted.

40|$|In a path-breaking but largely {{overlooked}} study, {{published in}} a festchrift thirty years ago (1975), Herman Van der Wee provided a comparison of prices and real wages of building craftsmen in the regions of Antwerp and south-eastern England, from 1400 to 1700. To do so, he constructed a <b>composite</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> modelled as closely as possibly on the famous 'basket of consumables' price index that Phelps Brown and Hopkins had produced, for south-eastern England, in 1956. His graphs revealed that real wages for these craftsmen in Antwerp did not suffer the same deterioration as did comparable real wages in England, and in {{many other parts of}} Europe, during the era of the Price Revolution, ca. 1520 - ca. 1640 [...] although the actual levels of the real wages were not shown. Most economic historians have attributed that significant fall in real wages, especially in England, to the consequences of population growth during this era: i. e., to a fall in the marginal productivity of labour, with a dramatic alteration in the land:labour ratio. There is, however, an alternative explanation: the consequences of an inflation, induced primarily by monetary forces, when nominal wages failed {{to keep pace with the}} rise in consumer prices (especially those for foodstuffs). This study examines the role of demographic, monetary, and also institutional factors in producing these diverging trends in real-wages. But the major contribution is to expand upon Van der Wee's study [...] which used only disembodied index numbers [...] by calculating the annual values of the baskets of consumables in both England and the Antwerp region, and thus in presenting the actual levels of real wages, in terms of the number of such baskets that building craftsmen could purchase with their annual money wages (for 210 days of employment), in each region, combining wage rates for summer and winter work (seasonal wages). The results are very striking. As measured in 50 -year harmonic means, the level of real wages for master masons in Antwerp was only 83. 79 % of that for master masons in south-east England, in 1401 - 50; and worse, only 78. 15 % of the level for English masons in 1451 - 1500; but then real wages for Antwerp master masons began to climb above those for their English counterparts: reaching 102. 60 % in 1501 - 50, 136. 34 % in 1551 - 1600; and, for the peak achievement, 154. 49 % in 1601 - 50, before falling back, somewhat, to a level of 125. 58 % in the final half century studied, in 1651 - 1700. But part of that gain or achievement for master masons in Antwerp was at the expense of the real incomes for their journeymen-labourers, who did not fare quite as well, in comparison with the English journeymen labourers: earning just 68. 94 % of their English counterparts in 1401 - 50; 69. 38 % in 1451 - 1500; 91. 18 % in 1501 - 50; 107. 60 % in 1551 - 1600; 133. 46 % in 1601 - 50; and 109. 88 % in the final period, 1651 - 1700. Oddly enough, the Antwerp masons (both masters and journeymen) fared the very best after Antwerp had passed its Golden Age. The hypothetical explanations for these divergencies may be even more interesting than the data themselves. The study concludes by examining the statistical and theoretical nature of 'real wages': in terms of the purchasing power of the annual nominal money wage; in terms of the marginal productivity of labour; in terms of the marginal revenue product of labour; and in terms of the Total Factor Productivity of the occupation or economy as a whole. These data, however, do not take account of another factor that may have narrowed the gap between the actual levels of consumption in southern England and the Antwerp region: excise taxes on consumption, which had been a basic feature of urban finances in the southern Low Countries since the thirteenth century, but which were introduced into England only in 1643, shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War between Crown and Parliament. prices, nominal wages, real wages, building craftsmen, masons, masters and labourers, inflation, deflation, consumer price index, Antwerp, England. ...|$|E
