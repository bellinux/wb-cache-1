5|$|A Trick of the Tail had a {{positive}} reception from music critics, who were impressed that the group <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> survive the loss of Gabriel but still deliver a good album. The sound quality had improved from previous albums {{as a result of}} Hentschel's production skills. The album reached No. 3 in the UK, remaining on the charts for 39 weeks, and No. 31 in the U.S. It was certified Gold in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry in June and in the US by the RIAA in March 1990. The album remained in the UK charts for 39 weeks and recouped a significant amount of $400,000 worth of debt they had accumulated by the time Gabriel left.|$|E
5|$|In September 1943, the Los Alamos Laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, {{arranged}} for von Neumann to visit Los Alamos and investigate implosion {{with a fresh}} set of eyes. After reviewing Neddermeyer's studies, and discussing the matter with Edward Teller, von Neumann suggested the use of high explosive in shaped charges to implode a sphere, which he showed <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> result in a faster assembly of fissile material than was possible with the gun method, but which could greatly {{reduce the amount of}} material required. The prospect of more efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller and Hans Bethe, but they decided that an expert on explosives was required. Kistiakowsky's name was immediately suggested, and he was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.|$|E
5|$|Van Meegeren {{felt that}} his genius had been misjudged, {{and he set}} out to prove to the art critics that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> copy the style of the Dutch masters in his paintings, but produce a work of art so {{magnificent}} that it would rival the works of master painters. He moved with Jo to the South of France and began preparations for this ultimate forgery, which took him six years, from 1932 to 1937. In a series of early exercises, he forged works by Frans Hals, Pieter de Hooch, Gerard ter Borch, and Johannes Vermeer. Finally, he chose to forge a painting by Vermeer as his masterpiece. Vermeer had not been particularly well-known until {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century; his works were both extremely valuable and scarce — only about 35 had survived.|$|E

5|$|As winter broke on 1 March 1799, General Jean Baptiste Jourdan and his 25,000-man Army of the Danube {{crossed the}} Rhine at Kehl. The Army of the Danube met little {{resistance}} as it advanced through the Black Forest and eventually took a flanking {{position on the}} north shore of Lake Constance. Instructed to block the Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in northern Italy, and prevent them from assisting one another. His was a preemptive strike. By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before Archduke Charles' army could be reinforced by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned soldiers and their more-seasoned commander, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between northern Italy and southwestern Germany, but could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer brought John von Neumann to Los Alamos in September 1943 {{to take a}} {{fresh look}} at implosion. After {{reviewing}} Neddermeyer's studies, and discussing the matter with Edward Teller, von Neumann suggested the use of high explosives in shaped charges to implode a sphere, which he showed <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> result in a faster assembly of fissile material than was possible with the gun method, but which could greatly reduce the amount of material required, because of the resulting higher density. The idea that, under such pressures, the plutonium metal itself would be compressed came from Teller, whose knowledge of how dense metals behaved under heavy pressure was influenced by his pre-war theoretical studies of the Earth's core with George Gamow. The prospect of more-efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller, and Hans Bethe, but they decided that an expert on explosives would be required. Kistiakowsky's name was immediately suggested, and Kistiakowsky was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to officials, teachers, merchants, farmers, artisans, and retainers, {{there were many}} other occupations. The pig-breeder was not seen as a lowly profession if it was merely utilized by a poor scholar {{to pay for a}} formal education. For example, the first chancellor in Han to lack either a military background or a title as marquess was the pig-breeder Gongsun Hong (公孫弘) of Emperor Wu's reign. Physicians who practiced medicine and studied medical classics <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> make a decent income, but were also able to gain an education and become officials. The physician Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was nominated for office while another became Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (郎中令). Those who practiced occult arts of Chinese alchemy and mediumship were often employed by the government to conduct religious sacrifices, while on rare occasions—such as with Luan Da (d. 112 BCE)—an occultist might marry a princesses or be enfeoffed as a marquess. While it was socially acceptable for gentry scholars to engage in the occult arts of divination and Chinese astrology, career diviners were of a lower status and earned only a modest income. Other humble occultist professions included sorcery and physiognomy; like merchants, those who practiced sorcery were banned from holding public office. Being a butcher was another lowly occupation, yet there is one case where a butcher became an official during Emperor Gaozu's reign, while Empress He (d. 189 CE) and her brother, the regent He Jin (d. 189 CE), came from a family of butchers. Runners and messengers who worked for the government were also considered to have a lowly status, yet some later became government officials.|$|E

25|$|The {{quest for}} {{rejuvenation}} reached its height with alchemy. All around Europe, and also beyond, alchemists {{were looking for}} the Philosopher's Stone, the mythical substance that, as it was believed, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> turn lead into gold, but also prolong life and restore youth. Although the set goal was not achieved, alchemy paved {{the way to the}} scientific method and so to the medical advances of today.|$|E

25|$|Jungle terrain offered ideal {{environments for}} such methods, but ambushes and {{harassment}} tactics {{were also used}} in civilian areas. Firing a few rounds and withdrawing <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> lure enemy troops into a trap based on civilian structures but could also induce US/ARVN forces to unleash hasty artillery and tactical air strikes after relatively token provocation. This created excessive destruction in the built up areas and helped radicalize the populace against the US/ARVN troops.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the first}} heroic horses {{emerged from the}} silent film era, they were {{prominently}} featured in the B-Westerns of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. During {{the early decades of}} sound film, cowboy movies targeted a juvenile demographic. The film's heroes were generally one-dimensional, stock characters who represented and promoted truth and goodness to their young audience. More popular with adolescent viewers than a human sidekick, the Wonder Horse <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> outrun the mounts of the villains, but could also perform a series of feats and tricks to ensure that the cowboy hero would triumph.|$|E
25|$|ENIAC was a modular computer, {{composed}} of individual panels to perform different functions. Twenty of these modules were accumulators which <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> add and subtract, but hold a ten-digit decimal number in memory. Numbers were passed between these units across several general-purpose buses (or trays, {{as they were}} called). In order to achieve its high speed, the panels had to send and receive numbers, compute, save the answer and trigger the next operation, all without any moving parts. Key to its versatility was the ability to branch; it could trigger different operations, depending on {{the sign of a}} computed result.|$|E
50|$|Following broad consultation, SEnU {{adopted a}} broader {{definition}} which {{is independent of}} any legal model.

25|$|Due to {{the high}} value of tea {{in many parts of}} Asia, tea bricks were used as a form of {{currency}} throughout China, Tibet, Mongolia, and Central Asia. This is quite similar to the use of salt bricks as currency in parts of Africa. Tea bricks were in fact the preferred form of currency over metallic coins for the nomads of Mongolia and Siberia. The tea <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> be used as money and eaten as food in times of hunger but also brewed as allegedly beneficial medicine for treating coughs and colds. Until World War II, tea bricks were still used as a form of edible currency in Siberia.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} 1928 that Geiger and Walther Müller (a PhD student of Geiger) {{developed}} the sealed Geiger-Müller tube which developed the basic ionization principles previously used experimentally. This was relatively small and rugged, and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> detect alpha and beta radiation such as prior models but also gamma radiation. Now a practical radiation instrument could be produced relatively cheaply, and so the Geiger-Muller counter was born. As the tube output required little electronic processing, a distinct advantage in the thermionic valve era due to minimal valve count and low power consumption, the instrument achieved great popularity as a portable radiation detector.|$|E
25|$|Case Study: The {{child of}} an incarcerated father and heroin-addicted, prostitute mother, {{was found on}} July 10, 2000 {{in the home of}} a 20-year-old woman in Germany. Social workers had visited the house at the urging of neighbors, but there was never {{evidence}} found that neglect was occurring. An autopsy showed no signs of previous fractures, illness or drugs, but the child was malnourished. The Muscina stabulans (False Stable Fly) and Fannia canicularis (Little House fly) were recovered from the genital area of the corpse. These particular flies are attracted to urine and/or feces much more than corpses. With the aid of this evidence and the third fly species recovered from the body, Calliphora vomitoria (Bluebottle Fly), the forensic entomologists <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> estimate the time of death, but prove that the child would have lived if proper legal action had been pursued against the negligent caregiver. The mother received a five-year prison sentence and two social workers were charged for duty of care violation.|$|E
