40|$|Counts of <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> (Phyllocoptruta oleivora (Ashm.)) on {{leaves and}} fruit of citrus {{rose to a}} peak in the two dry seasons, the build up taking 4 - 5 weeks. It then {{decreased}} partly through infection by the entomogenous fungus Hirsutellathompsonii Fisher and partly through a decline in feed quality. The low counts in the wet seasons were associated with rain rather than humidity, temperature or infections by H. thompsonii. Spraying with suspensions of fragmented mycelium of H. thompsonii (mass concentration 0. 5 - 1. 0 g litre - 1 ) prevented the build up of <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite.</b> The severity of greasy spot (Stenella sp.) {{was positively correlated with}} counts of <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite.</b> Defoliation of citrus trees after greasy spot infection was associated with high counts of mite.

Four cooperators with 2. 38 to 5. 22 hectare blocks of either ‘Hamlin ’ or ‘Valencia ’ oranges were switched to 224 °C or 235 °C horticultural mineral oil (HMO) -only foliar spray programs applied at 46. 8 liters/hectare for four years. HMO applications varied from one to three applications in the test blocks per location at each year. Cooperating grower spray programs included various fungicides, acaricides, insecticides, and HMOs. First year transition from the standard fungicide-insecticide-acaricide programs resulted in active <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> development, and multiple HMO treatments were required in three of the four sites for their control. Subsequent rust mite populations in years two, three, and four did not develop in three of four sites using the HMO-only foliar spray programs. Spider mite densities in the four HMO blocks never reached levels of economic injury during any year of the study. One of the cooperators was dropped after the third (2002) season, as the test block in his property was sprayed sometime early in 2003 with a pesticide that eliminated beneficial mite populations.

40|$|Pest {{populations in}} a given {{agroecosystem}} {{may be influenced by}} several abiotic and biotic variables, including the host plant cultivar. We compared the population fluctuation of pest mites in twenty citrus scion cultivars grafted on Rangpur lime (Citrus limonia). Adults of <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> Phyllocoptruta oleivora (Acari: Eriophyidae), Texas citrus mite Eutetranychus banksi and Tetranychus mexicanus (Acari:Tetranychidae) were monthly counted in each scion cultivar from April 2011 to February 2013 in Sergipe state, northeastern Brazil. Larger E. banksi population peak was recorded on sweet orange ‘Valência Montemorellos’ in February 2012 compared to the other cultivars and larger populations of T. mexicanus were found on sweet orange ‘Lima’ in January 2013 in comparison to acid limes ‘Tahiti IAC 5 ’ and ‘IAC 5 - 1 ’. The population of P. oleivora, however was not different among scion cultivars and varied only with time. Abiotic and biotic variables were important mechanisms underlying such responses.

However, little is known on citrus rootstocks influencing pest mites. We aimed to evaluate the influence of rootstocks on population densities of pest mites on the sweet oranges 'Pera CNPMF D- 6 ' and 'Valencia Tuxpan' throughout time. Adults of both mite species were monthly counted during 19 months from June 2011 to February 2013. Rootstocks influenced the populations of pest mites, since lower densities of P. oleivora were found on 'Pera CNPMF D- 6 ' sweet orange grafted on the hybrid TSKC × CTTR - 002 and on 'Swingle' citrumelo {{in comparison with the}} hybrid LVK × LCR - 010, 'Red' rough lime and 'Santa Cruz' rangpur lime as rootstocks.

We concluded that densities of the mites P. oleivora and T. mexicanus on the sweet oranges 'Pera CNPMF D- 6 ' and 'Valencia Tuxpan' were affected in some periods of the year by some rootstocks, suggesting influence of some genotypes on these pests. 201...|$|E

Foliar applications of oxamyl reduced nematode populations and increased fruit growth rate slightly the first year, {{but not in the}} second. Foliar applications of oxamyl did not improve control attained by DBCP alone. Soil {{application of}} aldicarb [2 -methyl- 2 -(methylthio) propionaldehyde-O-(methylcarbamoyl) oxime] or DBCP to an orange (C. sinensis) orchard reduced T. semipenetrans populations in the 3 years tested and increased yield in 1 of 3 years. Aldicarb treatment reduced fruit damage caused by the <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite,</b> Phyllocoptruta oleivora. Aldicarb, applied at 5. 7 or 11. 4 kg/ha, by disk incorporation or chisel injection, was equally effective in controlling nematodes, improving yields, fruit size, and external quality. In a grapefruit orchard, chisel-applied aldicarb reduced nematode populations and rust mite damage and increased yields in both years and increased fruit size in one year. The 11. 4 -kg/ha rate was slightly more effective than the 5. 7 -kg/ha rate.

Citrus is Israel’s number one fresh fruit export {{and must be}} free of pests and blemishes. Pest management in citrus groves in Israel is more-or-less satisfactory biological control of most aphids, scales, whiteflies, and mites [1]. Insecticides are used to control four primary pest species for which biological controls are insufficient: Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly), citrus mealybug, <b>citrus</b> <b>rust</b> <b>mite,</b> and California red scale. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in Israel’s citrus groves {{has been based on}} the judicious use of relatively selective insecticides, in combination with biological control.

When Green’s mealybug appeared as a serious pest of citrus in the 1930 ’s it was controlled by a parasite introduced in 1940 from Japan [3]. Another parasite introduced in 1952 from the USA controlled the long-tailed mealybug.

40|$|Although odour-mediated {{interactions}} among plants, spider mites and predatory mites have been extensively studied above-ground, belowground studies {{are in their}} infancy. In this paper, we investigate whether feeding by <b>rust</b> <b>mites</b> (Aceria tulipae) cause tulip bulbs to produce odours that attract predatory mites (Neoseiulus cucumeris). Since {{our aim was to}} demonstrate such odours and not their relevance under soil conditions, the experiments were carried out using a classic Y-tube olfactometer in which the predators moved on a Y-shaped wire in open air. We found that food-deprived female predators can discriminate between odours from infested bulbs and odours from uninfested bulbs or artificially wounded bulbs. No significant difference in attractiveness to predators was found between clean bulbs and bulbs either wounded 30 ?min or 3 ?h before the experiment. These results indicate that it may not be simply the wounding of the bulbs, but rather the feeding by <b>rust</b> <b>mites,</b> which causes the bulb to release odours that attract N. cucumeris.

To investigate which selection pressures may have moulded prey preference in an acarine system consisting of two prey species and three predator species, we tested whether prey preference of the predators is matched by the associated reproductive success. The predators involved areAmblyseius finlandicus (Oudemans),Am. potentillae (Garman) andTyphlodromus pyri Scheuten. The prey species are the apple <b>rust</b> <b>mite</b> (Aculus schlechtendali (Nalepa)) and the {{fruit-tree red spider mite}} (Panonychus ulmi (Koch)). Reproductive success was assessed in terms of intrinsic rate of increase and for one predator also in terms of diapause induction. All three predator species reached highest reproductive success on the same prey species: apple <b>rust</b> <b>mite.</b> This was most pronounced for the predatorAm. finlandicus, because its larval stage suffered severe mortality when feeding onP. ulmi. An independent study on prey preference of the three predator species (Dicke et al., 1988) revealed thatAm. finlandicus prefersAc. schlechtendali toP. ulmi, whereas the other two predator species have the reverse preference. Thus, on the basis of current data, prey preference ofAm. finlandicus can be understood in terms of reproductive success. However, this is not so for prey preference ofT. pyri andAm. potentillae.

In one year of the study (2006), five out of six orchards experienced elevated mite densities relative to the standard. In four orchards, novaluron caused a 3. 0 - 16. 9 × in-crease in mite populations; acetamiprid caused a 2. 6 - 3. 4 × increase, and thiacloprid caused a 1. 7 - 13. 8 × increase.
