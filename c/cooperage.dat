5|$|Despite the {{official}} opening occurring in 1846, {{the construction of}} the Albert Dock was not fully completed until 1847. In 1848, a new dock office was built and the dock itself was upgraded to feature a hydraulic cargo handling hoist system, {{the first of its kind}} in the world. Over the next decade several more buildings where added including houses for the piermaster, his assistant & the warehouse superintendent; and a <b>cooperage.</b> Warehousing in the dock was also expanded to meet the increasing demand by joining together the eastern and western ends of the Southern Stack.|$|E
5|$|O'Brien {{intended}} the brewery to be a modern facility {{similar to those}} in California, and brought in Charles Bolbrugge, a brewer from San Francisco, to run the operation. The facility probably took the form of a tower brewery, which minimised the requirements for power supplies, and had a <b>cooperage</b> built adjacent to it. Some of the equipment was probably reused from the local Eldorado Bottling works, which had closed three years before, and possibly the old Dawson City Brewery, which was then combined with up-to-date steam pumps, bottling machines and an artificial refrigeration plant. A variety of second-hand bottles were probably collected from around Dawson City, many of which were then reused at the new brewery, the remainder being discarded along the nearby river shore. The malt and hops for the brewing process were imported from California.|$|E

25|$|Since being {{promoted}} to the I-League in 2008, Mumbai FC has used the <b>Cooperage</b> Ground as its home ground. For the 2010–11 I-League season, the club played their home fixtures at the Rajarshi Shahu Stadium in Kolhapur, with the <b>Cooperage</b> Stadium undergoing renovation. From 2011–12 onwards till 2013–14, the club along with local rivals Air India played their home fixtures at the Balewadi Sports Complex in Pune.

50|$|The {{town was}} {{noted for its}} {{productive}} soil, water power and abundant forests of white pine. By 1859, when the population was 1,693, it had fifteen sawmills and two gristmills. In 1886, it had five lumber mills, three <b>cooperages,</b> a sash, blind and pump factory, four carriage factories, a tannery, a boot and shoe factory, and a coffin and bedstead factory.|$|R
25|$|Mumbai took {{advantage}} of getting back at the <b>Cooperage</b> {{and went on to}} win two straight home games by thrashing Goan giants Salgaocar 3–0 and then on 20th Feb 2015 defeating the then league leaders Royal Wahingdoh 2–1. Mumbai FC went on to win their first away game when they beat I-League new comers Bharat 2–0 which made it three wins in a row and took them to 4th place in the I-League table. The next match against Bengaluru at the <b>Cooperage</b> ended in a 1–1 draw as an equaliser in the second-half from the in-form Mumbai striker Josimar rescued a point for the Mumbaikars.|$|E

25|$|With {{the onset}} of Prohibition, Touhy and his {{brothers}} began distributing illegal beer and liquor in the northwest suburbs of Chicago. Touhy partnered with Matt Kolb, who was already supplying the Chicago Outfit with {{a third of its}} beer, as well as running highly profitable gambling and loan sharking operations north of Chicago. The two men established a brewery and <b>cooperage,</b> and produced a high quality beer. They soon were selling 1,000 barrels a week at $55 a barrel (for a profit of 92 percent).|$|E
25|$|To {{support the}} demand for the drink, the first rum {{distillery}} in the British colonies of North America {{was set up in}} 1664 on present-day Staten Island. Boston, Massachusetts had a distillery three years later. The manufacture of rum became early Colonial New England's largest and most prosperous industry. New England became a distilling center due to the technical, metalworking and <b>cooperage</b> skills and abundant lumber; the rum produced there was lighter, more like whiskey. Rhode Island rum even joined gold as an accepted currency in Europe for a period of time.|$|E

25|$|The Philipses used African {{slaves to}} build various {{structures}} at the Upper Mills and Lower Mills. The Upper Mills saw {{the building of}} two gristmills on the Pocantico River {{as well as a}} stone manor house, wharf, <b>cooperage,</b> and bake house. Most of the structures were completed by 1697, including the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow, now a National Historic Landmark. The Lower Mills saw a gristmill and manor house built on the north bank of the Neperhan River. The Philipses' aim was to make the manor a center for agriculture, which the achieved.|$|E
25|$|This was a {{particularly}} important time for whaling and its associated industries of shipbuilding and <b>cooperage</b> in Hobart Town as well. The waterfront of Hobart was upgraded in the 1830s to account for ever-increasing numbers of visiting foreign ships. Although the dock areas remained quite rough and ready, other areas of Hobart Town were developing into quite pleasant locales. In the early 1820s the shoreline of the river immediately {{to the north of}} the town had been set aside as the Kings Domain (later Queen's Domain) for use as a public space.|$|E
25|$|In large parts, Newcastle still {{retains a}} medieval street layout.

Stairs from the riverside to higher parts of the city centre and the extant Castle Keep, originally recorded in the 14th century, remain intact in places. Close, Sandhill and Quayside contain modern buildings as well as structures dating from the 15th–18th centuries, including Bessie Surtees House, the <b>Cooperage</b> and Lloyds Quayside Bars, Derwentwater House and House of Tides, a restaurant situated at a Grade I-listed 16th century merchant's house at 28–30 Close.|$|E

Its success went {{hand in hand with the}} growth of the {{shipbuilding}} industries on the Firth of Clyde in the nineteenth century and the emergence of Glasgow as the [...] "second city of the Empire". It also reflected the firm's skill in responding to an unprecedented demand for quality tools by shipyards, <b>cooperages</b> and other industries, both locally and far and wide.|$|R
50|$|The Victualling Yards in Britain had for {{the most}} part {{developed}} haphazardly over time. In 1822, however, the Victualling Board decided to rationalise its Plymouth operation in a new, centralised site at Stonehouse which was named the Royal William Victualling Yard. It consisted of a central Grand Storehouse, flanked by two sizeable manufactories alongside the waterfront: a mill/bakery on one side, a brewery on the other (providing biscuits and beer respectively). The other buildings on site include <b>cooperages</b> (for manufacturing barrels), officers' residences and an elegant Slaughterhouse (for provision of salted beef), all in matching limestone and arranged on a symmetrical grid layout.|$|R
25|$|The {{bacteria}} {{behind this}} {{process can be}} found naturally in the winery, in <b>cooperages,</b> which make oak wine barrels that will house a population of the bacteria or they can be introduced by the winemaker with a cultured specimen. For some wines, the conversion of malic into lactic acid can be beneficial, especially if the wine has excessive levels of malic acid. For other wines, such as Chenin blanc and Riesling, it produces off flavors in the wine (such as the buttery smell of diacetyl) {{that would not be}} appealing for that variety. In general, red wines are more often put through MLF than whites, which means a higher likelihood of finding malic acid in white wines (though notable exceptions, such as oaked Chardonnay, are often put through MLF).|$|R
25|$|The vast {{expanses of}} {{land of the}} Oval Maidan, Azad Maidan, <b>Cooperage</b> Ground and Cross Maidan until the early 20th century formed the area known as Esplanade.

The term Esplanade is almost obliterated from history books except for the Bombay High Court which still goes by the term esplanade court. The part of MG Road abutting the Cross Maidan is popularly known as Fashion Street, with a range of vogue clothing at throwaway prices.|$|E
25|$|Fernow's {{plan called}} for clearcutting the tract {{at the rate of}} several {{thousand}} acres per year to prepare for planting conifers. With an annual state appropriation for the college of only $10,000, Cornell entered into a contract with the Brookyn <b>Cooperage</b> Company for the project to be viable. Under terms of the contract, the firm was to take the logs and cordwood from the forest land for a 15-year period. (In the 1890s, the more valuable red spruce trees had been logged, leaving primarily northern hardwoods.) Fernow had a -long railroad spur built from Axton to Tupper Lake in order to deliver logs to the company's facility. The firm turned the hardwood logs into barrels and the cordwood into methanol and charcoal, through a process called destructive distillation.|$|E
25|$|The club {{played their}} first {{season in the}} I-League during the 2008–09 I-League season. The club played their first ever I-League match against {{historic}} club Mohun Bagan on 27 September 2008 in which Abel Hammond scored the first ever I-League goal for Mumbai FC as Mumbai {{went on to win}} 2–1 at the Barasat Stadium. Mumbai then completed a double against the two giant Kolkata clubs after they defeated East Bengal at the Salt Lake Stadium 1–0 with Felix Aboagye scoring the only goal. Mumbai then played their first ever home match in their history at the <b>Cooperage</b> Ground on 11 October 2008 with Kalia Kulothungan scoring the only goal in the match.

2500|$|A {{distinct}} {{characteristic of}} Rioja wine {{is the effect}} of oak aging. First introduced in the early 18th century by Bordeaux influenced winemakers, the use of oak and the pronounced vanilla flavors in the wines has been a virtual trademark of the region though some modern winemakers are experimenting with making wines less influenced by oak. Originally French oak was used but as the cost of the barrels increased many bodegas began to buy American oak planks and fashion them into barrels at Spanish <b>cooperages</b> in a style more closely resembling the French method. This included hand splitting the wood, rather than sawing, and allowing the planks time to dry and [...] "season" [...] in the outdoors versus drying in the kiln. In recent times, more bodegas have begun using French oak and many will age wines in both American and French oak for blending purposes.|$|R
50|$|By 1739 {{the various}} Victualling Office {{facilities}} {{cost the state}} £16,241 to maintain, in addition to expenses {{for the purchase of}} victuals. In 1747, during the War of the Austrian Succession, this had risen to £30,393. In due course facilities were consolidated into Victualling Yards each with several processes and related storehouses accommodated on a single site. The Yards had deep-water wharves and were accessible (wind and weather permitting) from the major anchorages used by the Fleet. Under normal circumstances, ships due to set sail were expected to come to the nearest Yard to be loaded up with provisions. These would include preserved foodstuffs designed to last weeks or even months: ship's biscuit, salted beef, salted pork, pease, oatmeal, butter, cheese and beer. Most of these items were transported and stored in casks, which were themselves manufactured by the Board in large numbers at its on-site <b>cooperages.</b> In addition, the Victualling Yards provided fresh meat, bread and other items to ships stationed in port.|$|R
25|$|Under British {{rule the}} Royal Navy {{made use of}} a {{careening}} wharf at Port Royal and rented a building on the foreshore {{to serve as a}} storehouse. From 1675 a resident Naval Officer was appointed to oversee these facilities; however, development was cut short by the 1692 earthquake. After the earthquake, an attempt was made to establish a naval base at Port Antonio instead, but the climate there proved disagreeable. From 1735, Port Royal once more became the focus of the Admiralty's attention. New wharves and storehouses were built at this time, as well as housing for the officers of the Yard. Over the next thirty years, more facilities were added: <b>cooperages,</b> workshops, sawpits, and accommodation (including a canteen) for the crews of ships being careened there. A Royal Naval Hospital was also established on land a little {{to the west of the}} Naval Yard; and by the end of the 18th century a small Victualling Yard had been added to the east (prior to this ships had had to go to Kingston and other settlements to take on supplies).|$|R
