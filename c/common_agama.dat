50|$|The largest lizards in Pian Upe are the Savannah monitors. Others in {{the reserve}} include the <b>common</b> <b>agama</b> {{as well as}} skinks, {{chameleons}} and geckos.|$|E
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>agama</b> can {{be found}} native in {{countries}} such as Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cape Verde Islands, Chad, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Togo."Agama agama is well-suited to arid conditions. These lizards remain active throughout the day except for the hottest hour, when even shady spots can reach 100 degrees F. When the mercury climbs that high, even the agama finds a cool place to rest.|$|E
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>agamas</b> are {{primarily}} insectivores, {{but they have}} been known to eat small mammals, reptiles and vegetation. They catch their prey using their tongue, the tip of which is covered by mucous glands that enable the lizard to hold to smaller prey.|$|R

50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>agama,</b> {{red-headed}} rock agama, or rainbow agama (Agama agama) is {{a species}} of lizard from the Agamidae family found in most of sub-Saharan Africa. The species name was formerly applied to a paraphyletic collection of taxa, and mitochondrial DNA analysis of various populations indicates they represent separate species. Consequently, three former subspecies A. a. africana, A. a. boensis, and A. a. mucosoensis are now considered separate species, and A. a. savattieri is considered synonymous with A. Africana.|$|E
5000|$|Gobiguania is an extinct clade of iguanian lizards {{from the}} Late Cretaceous. All known gobiguanians are endemic to the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Gobiguania {{was given a}} phylogenetic {{definition}} by Jack Conrad and Mark Norell in 2007 as all taxa {{more closely related to}} Anchaurosaurus gilmorei than to Iguana iguana (the green iguana), Crotaphytus collaris (the common collared lizard), or Agama agama (the <b>common</b> <b>agama).</b> According to Conrad and Norell's phylogenetic analysis, Gobiguania includes Anchaurosaurus as well as several other Late Cretaceous lizards such as Ctenomastax, Temujinia, Saichangurvel, and Zapsosaurus. A phylogenetic analysis published in 2012 indicated that three other lizard genera — Igua, Isodontosaurus, and Polrussia, all from Mongolia and all from the Late Cretaceous — are also gobiguanians. Below is a cladogram from the analysis: ...|$|E
50|$|The Peninsular rock agama or South Indian rock agama, Psammophilus dorsalis, is a <b>common</b> {{species of}} <b>agama</b> found on rocky hills in south India. An allied species, Psammophilus blanfordanus, {{is found in}} the Eastern Ghats, but north of the range of this species.|$|R
40|$|Smears of {{peripheral}} {{blood from the}} <b>common</b> rainbow lizard (<b>Agama</b> agama) were examined for the distribution and localization of lipid, glycogen, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase, {{using a variety of}} staining techniques. While erythrocytes were strongly reactive with the peroxidase test, granulocytes and monocytes were only weakly or moderately active. Lipid and glycogen, as well as acid and alkaline phosphatase, were found in granulocytes and monocytes. Some lymphocytes showed weak acid phosphatase and moderate PAS activities. A small population of 'mononuclear' cells was noted which were not reactive to any of the histochemical tests adopted...|$|R
40|$|International audienceStarting in 1917, several {{organizations}} {{were established in}} Singaraja, whose members started publishing journals, a complete novelty for Bali. Written in Malay, these publications provided a forum where the emerging Balinese intellectual elite could confront the changes which they were facing {{as a result of}} increasing interference by the colonial government in native affairs. The polemic opposing triwangsa and jaba - expressed through their respective mouthpieces Bali Adnjana (1924 - 1930) and Surya Kanta (1925 - 1927) - has been much publicized, even if it yet remains to be thoroughly investigated. At first sight, one would be inclined to see the jaba as the forerunners of modernity and progress, which would leave the triwangsa as the proponents of tradition and conservatism. But things are not as clear-cut, as both factions were claiming to be "progress-minded" (madjoe), all the while showing a similar concern over asserting their identity as Balinese. In these journals, Balinese identity - called Kebalian - was construed as being based on agama and on adat. Yet, if triwangsa and jaba shared a <b>common</b> reference to <b>agama</b> and adat, as the pillars of Kebalian, they diverged as to how their respective domains were related. Whereas Bali Adnjana wished to strengthen both agama and adat, Surya Kanta wanted to invigorate agama but to get rid of whatever in adat was deemed incompatible with progress. That is, for the former, Balinese religion was based on the traditional social order, within which agama was inseparable from adat, while for the latter, religion could and should be dissociated from a traditional order seen not only as unfair, but also as an obstacle to progress...|$|R
