Numerical simulating of the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> is carried out. Implementation process of this method is discussed in detail. With processing the data of solving results, parameters in capture area are got under different Inlet Velocity Ratio (IVR) condition with this method. Efficiency and hydraulic loss of the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> are calculated for the waterjet propulsor. The results are compared with that got with semi-elliptical fitting method. The calculation results obtained with both methods show good consistency. When IVR equals to 0. 6, the efficiency reaches a maximum value, about 0. 943. And the hydraulic loss reaches a minimum value, about 0. 76. In the whole IVR range, the relative error of efficiency between these two methods is less than 0. 2 %. The relative error of hydraulic loss of the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> between these two methods is less than 1. 3 %.

40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of “buzz-saw” noise in a turbofan <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> necessitates consideration of nonlinear acoustics, modelling a complete fan blade set, modelling an acoustic liner, and calculations at high frequencies. A recent series of papers has described new work concerning {{the application of}} one-dimensional propagation models to the {{prediction of}} buzz-saw noise. A numerical model, termed the frequency domain numerical solution or FDNS, has been developed. It can be used to calculate the nonlinear propagation of the rotor-alone pressure field in either a rigid or acoustically-lined <b>inlet</b> <b>duct.</b> From this the in-duct noise level of the buzz-saw tones can be determined. In previous work, validation of this method by comparison with in-duct noise measurements has been limited to rigid <b>inlet</b> <b>ducts,</b> {{because of the lack of}} availability of suitable measurements from lined ducts. In this article new measurements of buzz-saw noise in an acoustically-lined <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> are utilized. A comparison of measurements of buzz-saw noise in a lined <b>inlet</b> <b>duct,</b> and noise predictions from numerical simulations by the FDNS is presented.

40|$|Fan {{noise is}} one of the {{principal}} noise sources generated by a turbofan aero-engine. At supersonic fan speeds, fan tones are generated by the “rotor-alone” pressure field. In general, these tones can be well absorbed by an <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> acoustic liner, apart from at high supersonic fan speeds. However, in practice <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> liners contain acoustically hard longitudinal splices which cause scattering. This leads to acoustic energy being scattered into a range of different azimuthal mode orders, similar to the modal content resulting from rotor–stator interactions. The effectiveness of an <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> lining is reduced because acoustic energy is scattered into modes that are poorly absorbed by the liner. In this article, the effect of this acoustic scattering is examined by three-dimensional finite-element simulations of sound transmission in a turbofan <b>inlet</b> <b>duct.</b> Results include predictions of the sound power transmission loss with different splice widths, and at different supersonic fan speeds. These results demonstrate how acoustic scattering by liner splices can adversely affect fan tone noise levels at low supersonic fan speeds, but have little adverse affect on noise levels at high supersonic fan speeds. The potential noise benefit that could be achieved by manufacturing thinner splices is also examined...|$|R

40|$|Turbofan engine-face flow {{distortion}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} troublesome and least understood problems for designers of modern engine inlet systems. One concern is that there are numerous sources of flow-field distortion that are ingested by the inlet or generated within the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> itself. Among these are: (1) flow separation at the cowl lip during in-flight maneuvering, (2) flow separation on the compression surfaces due to shock-wave/boundary layer interactions, (3) spillage of the fuselage boundary layer into the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct,</b> (4) ingestion of aircraft vortices and wakes emanating from upstream disturbances, and (5) strong secondary flow gradients and flow separation induced by wall curvature within the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> itself. Most developing aircraft (including the B 70, F- 111, F- 14, Mig- 25, Tornado, and Airbus A 300) have experienced one or more of these types of problems, particularly at high Mach numbers and/or extreme maneuver conditions when flow distortion at the engine face exceeded the allowable limits of the engine...|$|R

The non-linear propagation of a high-amplitude irregular sawtooth upstream inside the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> redistributes the energy amongst the buzz-saw tones. In most modern aero-engines the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> contains an acoustic lining, whose properties will be dependent on the mode number and frequency of the sound, and the speed of the oncoming flow.

Results are presented comparing noise predictions in hard-walled and acoustically lined <b>inlet</b> <b>ducts.</b> These show the effect of an acoustic liner on the buzz-saw tones.

The first aspect is an experimental investigation, based on a modal detec-tion in the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct,</b> proving that the wake-interaction noise from the impingement of the impeller blade wakes on the diffuser vanes is the dominant mechanism. The second aspect is the analytical modelling of the sound transmission from the impeller outer radius through the inter-blade channels and its recombination as helical modes in the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct.</b> The propagation inside the inter-blade channels is described by a slowly-varying bent duct approach, for which a simplified description of the channel geometry is considered.

ANC concepts capable of suppressing discrete-tone spinning modes containing several cut-on radial mode were identified, developed analytically, and evaluated. Separate ANC systems that suppressed {{at least three}} radial modes in a cylindrical <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> and three radial modes in an exhaust annulus were developed. These designs resulted in <b>inlet</b> <b>duct</b> and exhaust duct tests that were performed at NASA on the 4 -ft ANC Fan in the NASA Glenn AAPL facility. Effective suppression of 2 -BPF spinning mode m = 2 tone noise was achieved over a range of fan speeds 1800 to 2450 rpm, where up to 4 radials were present. In the <b>inlet</b> <b>duct,</b> up to 12 dB reduction was obtained for 3 radial modes, and up to 4 dB was obtained with 4 radial modes. In the exhaust duct, up to 15 dB PWL reduction was obtained with either two or three radial modes present. Thus, the ability to suppress multiple radial modes for tones in both the <b>inlet</b> and exhaust <b>ducts</b> has been successfully demonstrated.
