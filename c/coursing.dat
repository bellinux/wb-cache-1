5|$|During the 2006–07 <b>coursing</b> season, {{the leading}} United States <b>coursing</b> body, the National Open Field <b>Coursing</b> Association, {{registered}} 480dogs of various breeds, and oversaw 83 <b>coursing</b> events. Its quarry is the black-tailed jackrabbit. <b>Coursing</b> of white-tailed jackrabbits is organised by a smaller body, the North American <b>Coursing</b> Association.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of open (not park) <b>coursing,</b> the (British) National <b>Coursing</b> Club {{evidence}} to the Burns Inquiry said that muzzled <b>coursing</b> can cause more suffering than unmuzzled if the <b>coursing</b> officials {{are not able to}} reach injured hares quickly. The Irish Council Against Bloodsports, an organisation that campaigns against hare <b>coursing</b> has video evidence that shows this happening, even in enclosed <b>coursing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lure <b>coursing</b> is a {{sport for}} dogs based on hare <b>coursing,</b> but {{involving}} dogs chasing a mechanically operated lure. Some critics of hare <b>coursing</b> suggest that coursers could test their dogs through lure <b>coursing.</b> However, coursers believe that, while lure <b>coursing</b> is good athletic exercise for their dogs, {{it does not}} approximate the testing vigour and sport of live <b>coursing.</b>|$|E

40|$|Effective and {{successful}} language <b>course</b> needs careful management. Language <b>course</b> management includes four main steps: <b>course</b> design, <b>course</b> promotion, <b>course</b> implementation, and <b>course</b> evaluation. Language <b>course</b> design is a dy- namic and negotiated process between the <b>course</b> manager and the learner. After the negotiation, {{the objective of}} the <b>course</b> based on the learners’ needs can be formulated, the suitable approach is adopted, the <b>course</b> materials, the methods and media, and the <b>course</b> tuition are determined. The role of <b>course</b> promotion is essential to achieve the success of the language <b>course.</b> The <b>course</b> promotion should be interesting, promisisng to attract the learners’ motivation to join the <b>course.</b> The <b>course</b> designer, the tutor, and administrator sould do their best in serving the learners. To make the bettrment of the language <b>course</b> conducted the <b>course</b> de- signer should conduct learner assessment and <b>course</b> evaluation.   Key words:   course management, <b>course</b> design, <b>course</b> promotion, <b>course</b> imple- mentation, and <b>course</b> evaluation...|$|R

5|$|According to the UK Government review, the Burns Inquiry (published in 2000), hare <b>coursing</b> {{was taking}} place in Pakistan, Portugal and Spain. Pakistan has officially {{prohibited}} the use of dogs or hawks for <b>coursing</b> unless a special licence is issued for carrying out such activity although, according to some reports, hare <b>coursing</b> is still practised and popular. Hare <b>coursing</b> in Portugal is run in both forms: open (Prova de Galgos a Campo), and closed (park) <b>coursing</b> where it is known as lebre a corricão. Hare <b>coursing</b> in Portugal may only be legally undertaken with two dogs and operates under the same ethos as <b>coursing</b> in the United States. In Spain, the hare <b>coursing</b> is open <b>coursing,</b> and the areas where the activity takes place includes the Medinrua area. <b>Coursing</b> has long been undertaken in Spain, where Spanish galgos rather than greyhounds are used. These dogs have a precarious life after their <b>coursing</b> careers, with World Animal Protection suggesting that many tens of thousands die cruelly each year. Hare <b>coursing</b> also takes place in Russia but is illegal in most European countries and in Australia, where it {{had a long history}} from 1867 until it was banned in 1985 following a long decline in popularity.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, {{such as in}} the UK, hares are {{not always}} seen as pests, and there are species action plans aiming to {{significantly}} increase their numbers. Some coursers say that <b>coursing</b> assists conservation because it leads to sporting landowners creating a habitat suitable for hares. Opponents of <b>coursing</b> say that the converse is true, namely that <b>coursing</b> takes place where hares live rather than hares living where <b>coursing</b> takes place. It is also the case that <b>coursing</b> kills slower hares, and it is said by some coursers that this leaves faster hares to breed and multiply.|$|E
5|$|Modern hare <b>coursing</b> {{is practiced}} using {{a number of}} sighthounds: mainly greyhounds but also Borzois, Salukis, Whippets, and Deerhounds that are {{registered}} with a governing body such as the National <b>Coursing</b> Club or Kennel Club in Great Britain, the Irish <b>Coursing</b> Club, or the National Open Field <b>Coursing</b> Association (NOFCA) in the US. Events are conducted through local <b>coursing</b> clubs which are regulated by their governing body. The objective of legal formal <b>coursing</b> is to test and judge the athletic ability of the dogs rather than to kill the hare.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{differences}} between the rules of <b>coursing</b> in Great Britain (where it is regulated by the National <b>Coursing</b> Club) and Irish <b>coursing</b> which has been organised by the Irish <b>Coursing</b> Club since 1916. Because hares are not plentiful {{in all parts of}} the island of Ireland, mainly due to modern agricultural practices, <b>coursing</b> clubs are licensed by the Irish government to net 70–75 hares for their events. The hares are then transported in boxes to the <b>coursing</b> venue where they are kept for up to eight weeks and trained to be coursed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Coursing</b> {{declined}} {{during the}} 20th century, notably {{due to the}} development of urban greyhound racing in the 1920s, and there were fewer than 30 <b>coursing</b> clubs in the UK by 2000.|$|E
5|$|Hare <b>coursing</b> {{is popular}} in the Republic of Ireland, with the {{national}} meeting in Clonmel, County Tipperary, being the most important event in the <b>coursing</b> calendar, attracting 10,000spectators, and claimed by its organisers to be worth up to €16million for the local economy. There are around 70formal <b>coursing</b> clubs in the Republic and two in Northern Ireland, together holding 80–85 meetings per year.|$|E

5|$|No formal <b>coursing</b> {{has taken}} place in Northern Ireland since 2002, as Ministers have refused the <b>coursing</b> clubs {{permission}} to net hares, and have protected them from being coursed or hunted under the Game Preservation (Northern Ireland) Act and in June 2010 the Northern Ireland Assembly voted to ban the practice. The two extant Northern Ireland <b>coursing</b> clubs since 2002 have travelled to the Republic to hold meetings jointly with <b>coursing</b> clubs there. Opinion polls commissioned by the League Against Cruel Sports as part of its campaigning have shown very strong public opposition to hare <b>coursing</b> from both urban and rural residents of Northern Ireland (and the Republic of Ireland).|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{documented}} {{description of}} hare <b>coursing</b> {{is the work}} known in English as On <b>Coursing.</b> It was written by Arrian a Greek historian of the Roman period, circa 180AD and is known in Anicent Greek as Kynegetikos and in Latin as Cynegeticus. Arrian felt compelled to describe the sight hunt and sighthounds because the Ancient Greeks only knew the scent hunt; On <b>Coursing</b> complements Xenophon's classic work on that subject, Cynegeticus (On Hunting). William Dansey, an English clergyman, translated On <b>Coursing</b> in 1831.|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} of hare <b>coursing</b> has only recently, in historical terms, been debated in Parliament, although Parliament created an exemption in 1921 from the cruelty legislation, the Protection of Animals Act 1911, for animals released for <b>coursing.</b> Eric Heffer, MP for Liverpool Walton, {{was a major}} opponent of <b>coursing</b> in the late 1960s, and Prime Minister Harold Wilson joined in the criticism.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, <b>coursing</b> {{crossed the}} class divide, and {{reached its peak}} of popularity, with more than 150coursing clubs in Britain, some {{attracting}} up to 80,000 people. By the late 19th century, hare <b>coursing</b> had become a predominantly working class sport.|$|E
5|$|Greyhounds were {{introduced}} in the Americas for sport and pleasure, they helped farmers control jackrabbits, and organised <b>coursing</b> meets were {{taking place in the}} United States in the 19th century, by 1886 according to Gulf Coast Greyhounds. Open field <b>coursing</b> of jackrabbits, which are members of the hare family, now takes place {{in a number of states}} in Western America, including California, Montana and Wyoming, and is said by the North American <b>Coursing</b> Association to take place also in Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah. It takes place with up to four dogs chasing the hare.|$|E
50|$|Each rated <b>course</b> should post a {{calculation}} of the player's <b>course</b> handicap. <b>Course</b> handicaps are always rounded to whole numbers, and reflect {{the difficulty of the}} <b>course</b> relative to an average <b>course.</b> For example, an individual with a handicap of 5.9 playing on a difficult <b>course</b> might have a <b>course</b> handicap of 8.

5|$|The {{legality}} of hare <b>coursing</b> across the different {{states of the}} USA is not always clear. Animal Place, a California-based animal rights group which opposes <b>coursing,</b> claims that the activity is legal in California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming but illegal in Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin. The pro-coursing campaign, Stop2110 says that open field <b>coursing</b> is legal in all US states with a huntable population of jackrabbits. Washington state lists jackrabbits as a protected species, due to an unusually low population for a western state, and bans all forms of hunting them.|$|E
5|$|The oldest form of hare <b>coursing</b> simply {{involved}} {{two dogs}} chasing a hare, the winner being the dog {{that caught the}} hare; this could be for sport, food or pest control. In order to indulge in the informal practice, or hunting, various cross breeds (under the generic British term lurchers) have been created; such animals may be specifically bred for <b>coursing,</b> such as the staghounds used to hunt coyote in the United States. Informal <b>coursing</b> has long been closely associated with pheasant hunting or poaching, lacking the landowner's permission, and is often seen as a problem by the local public, landowners and the police. Clubs affiliated to the Association of Lurcher Clubs organised informal <b>coursing</b> with the landowner's permission, sometimes using a single lurcher rather than a pair to chase a hare.|$|E
