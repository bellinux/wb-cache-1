40|$|Packaging {{films are}} an {{inevitable}} {{aspect of the}} modem societies. This is especially so in the food containment industry. These days most of the packaging films that {{are available in the}} market are made from polyolefmic materials. Although these materials perform superior package functions, they are riot biodegradable. This is a cause of concern for the environment. Unlike polyolefinic packaging, packaging made from regenerated cellulose films are biodegradable because of their cellulosic source. However, modification of these films to deliver suitable packaging functions could compromise the biodegradability of these films. The application of an impemieable thermoplastic coating,. of colorants and the use ofplasticizers are among the modifications that interfer~with the biodegradability of the regenerated cellulose packaging. The influence of several factors on the biodegradation behaviour of different types of coated and uncoated <b>cellophane</b> <b>films</b> was studied in this research. Two general approaches were undertaken for this study. Firstly, the influence of a specific colour reducing bacterium, Shewanella strain JI 8 143, on coated regenerated cellulose films, in the presence {{and in the absence of}} colorant materials, was investigated. Secondly, microorgamsms that are capable of degrading various coated and uncoated regenerated cellulose films were enriched from landfill soil inocula. Degradation behaviour of each film was then studied using the cultivated culture. Several. analytical techniques were used to establish the changes that were induced into the treated regenerated cellulose. films. Techniques such as UV spectrophotometry, FTIR spectrop 40 tometry, contact angle measurement, SEM analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and gas chromatography were used. A number of molecular biology approaches such as the polymerase chain reaction (peR) procedure and restriction enzyme digestion were undertaken to an~lyse the community profile ofthe enriched culture. Evidence is given to show that the nitrocellulose coating underwent denitrification when treated with Shewqnella 118 143 culture in the presence of azo dye. However, poly(vinylidene chloride) coating incubated with Shewanella 118 143 culture did not undergo any significant chemical changes either in theÃ‚Â· presence or in the absence of azo dye. The enrichment study, based on the biodegradation of various regenerated cellulose films, indicated that the biodegradation rate of cellulosic films was greater under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. The enrichment provides a number of cÃ‚Â·ultures that are capable of utilising <b>cellophane</b> <b>films</b> as a carbon source, under anaerobic conditions.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect of chitosan and plasticizer concentrations and oil presence on the physical and mechanical properties of edible films. The effect of the film constituents and their in-between interactions were studied through the evaluation of permeability, opacity and mechanical properties. The effects of the studied variables (concentrations of chitosan, plasticizer and oil) were analysed according to a 2 3 factorial design. Pareto charts were used to identify the most significant factors in the studied properties (water vapour, oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability; opacity; tensile strength; elongation at break and Young's modulus). When addressing {{the influence of the}} interactions between the films' constituents on the properties above, results show that chitosan and plasticizer concentrations are the most significant factors affecting most of the studied properties, while oil incorporation has shown to be of a great importance in the particular case of transport properties (gas permeability), essentially due to its hydrophobicity. Water vapour permeability values (ranging from 1. 62 × 10 - 11 to 4. 24 × 10 - 11 g m - 1 s - 1 Pa - 1) were half of those reported for <b>cellophane</b> <b>films.</b> Also the mechanical properties (tensile strength values from 0. 43 to 13. 72 MPa and elongation-at-break values from 58. 62 % to 166. 70 %) were in the range of those reported for LDPE and HDPE. Based on these results, we recommend the use of 1. 5 % (w/w) chitosan concentration to produce films, where the oil and plasticizer proportions will have to be adjusted in a case-by-case basis according to the use intended for the material.

The effect of conditioning of cellophane membranes by stepwise changing of composition of ethanol-water binary mixtures (from ethanol to water and from water to ethanol) was studied. It was shown that such treatment leads to an increase of ethanol permeability more than two orders of magnitude over initial untreated film samples. Treated cellophane membranes possess the ethanol permeability coefficient comparable with the values for highly permeability glassy polymers. Investigation of cellophane swelling in water ethanol solutions allowed to conclude that during the treatment formation of porous in the film takes place due to increase of inter chain distances. Observed high ethanol permeability connected {{with the fact that}} formed porous structure remains after the replacement of water with ethanol.

40|$|Previous {{research}} in our laboratory reported a convenient laboratory-scale composting test method {{to study the}} weight loss of polymer films in aerobic thermophilic (53 °C) reactors maintained at a 60 % moisture content. The laboratory-scale compost reactors contained the following synthetic compost mixture (percentage on dry-weight basis) : tree leaves (45. 0), shredded paper (16. 5), food (6. 7), meat (5. 8), cow manure (17. 5), sawdust (1. 9), aluminum and steel shavings (2. 4), glass beads (1. 3), urea (1. 9), and a compost seed (1. 0) which is designated Mix- 1 in this work. To simplify the laboratory-scale compost weight loss test method and better understand how compost mixture compositions and environmental parameters affect the rate of plastic degradation, a systematic variation of the synthetic mixture composition {{as well as the}} moisture content was carried out. Cellulose acetate (CA) with a degree of substitution (DS) value of 1. 7 and <b>cellophane</b> <b>films</b> were chosen as test polymer substrates for this work. The extent of CA DS- 1. 7 and cellophane weight loss {{as a function of the}} exposure time remained unchanged when the metal and glass components of the mixture were excluded in Mix- 2. Further study showed that large variations in the mixture composition such as the replacement of tree leaves, food, meat, and sawdust with steam-exploded wood and alfalfa (forming Mix-C) could be made with little or no change in the time dependence of CA DS- 1. 7 film weight loss. In contrast, substituting tree leaves, food, meat, cow manure, and sawdust with steam-exploded wood in combination with either Rabbit Choice (Mix-D) or starch and urea (Mix-E) resulted in a significant time increase (from 7 to 12 days) for the complete disappearance of CA DS- 1. 7 films. Interestingly, in this work no direct correlation was observed between the C/N ratio (which ranged from 13. 9 to 61. 4) and the CA DS- 1. 7 film weight loss. Decreasing moisture contents of the compost Mix- 2 from 60 and 50 and 40 % resulted in dramatic changes in polymer degradation such that CA DS- 1. 7 showed an increase in the time period for a complete disappearance of polymer films from 6 to 16 and 30 days, respectively. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Aspects of {{the mass}} {{transport}} processes occurring in the ion-exchange membranes, PUDO 193, a Cellophane membrane derived from regenerated cellulose and Permion 2291 40 / 30, a grafted co-polymer of polyethylene and methacrylic acid, were studied while the membranes were swollen in solutions of KOH {{of a wide range}} of concentrations. Measurement of the dimensional changes (length, width and thickness) of as received <b>Cellophane</b> <b>films,</b> after immersion in solutions of KOH, revealed a complex swelling behaviour with the majority of swelling resulting in changes in thickness. Unlike Cellophane, and as a consequence of their different structure, the swelling behaviour of Permion films were found to be less complex. The swelling behaviour was used to determine the porosity of the swollen membranes. The ion-exchange capacity of the mono-functional Permion was obtained by pH titration, a method unsuitable for use with Cellophane since it is not fully exchanged at low external electrolyte concentrations. The ion-exchange properties of Cellophane were determined using atomic absorption techniques and a cr ion tracer method which was deemed suitable since similar results were obtained for Permion by this method and by pH titration. Transport numbers of potassium ions and transference numbers of water through Cellophane and Permion as single membrane types were obtained using a meticulous technique, which minimised the unwanted effects of diffusion and osmosis. The method obtained transport numbers relevant to a specific concentration by holding solution composition constant and equal on either side of the membrane. The confidence gained in the technique, enhanced by careful cell testing and the application of correction factors, provided a sound basis for the measurement and subsequent understanding of transport behaviour in the less obvious situation, namely in assemblies of membranes. Measurements of the resistance of <b>Cellophane</b> and Permion <b>films</b> equilibrated in solutions of KOH were made. Membrane resistance vs. membrane thickness plots were curved due to current refraction into the region where the membrane was clamped between the two halves of the conductivity cell. The data was linearised using a nonempirical correction factor and hence the accuracy of the measured membrane conductivity was improved. From the primary resistance data, electrolyte conductivity and the mobilities of the potassium and hydroxyl ions in free solution were calculated. The ratio of potassium to hydroxyl ion mobility in free solution formed a basis for a comparison with a similar mobility ratio in the membrane phase. This method allowed a comparison of mobilities in free solution and the membrane phase without the necessity of estimating a suitable tortuosity factor. Models of tortuosity were then introduced to assess the blocking characteristics of the two membranes. The transport properties of assemblies of Cellophane and Permion were investigated. Transport numbers entering and leaving the assembly were found to be different and depended on the orientation of the assembly. For the situation where transport numbers were greater leaving the assembly and at low current densities a steady state was reached and the depletion of electrolyte at the interface was replaced by diffusion, osmosis and hydraulic flow. At high current densities depletion of electrolyte at the interface was rapid causing the decomposition of the Cellophane. For the situation where transport numbers were greater entering the assembly, the assembly separated at the Permion/Cellophane interface due to the accumulation of electrolyte, the difference between measured and predicted transport numbers was accounted for by the effects of diffusion and osmosis which occurred mainly in the Cellophane...|$|R

Preliminary to the {{exploration}} of the lBP effects, the IBP-tolerant isolate, designated as PT 83, was obtained through the selection of the tolerant colony which had originated from protoplasts of an IBP-sensitive isolate P 2. The growth of hyphal mass of P 2 was perfectly inhibited PDA and in Vogel liquid medium, respectively, at 40 and 20 ppm, whereas that of PT 83 was not even at 40 ppm. The appressorium formation of P 2 conidia grown on <b>cellophane</b> <b>film</b> was perfectly inhibited at 5 ppm, while that of PT 83 was not perfectly even at 50 ppm although it was suppressed more with the increased concentrations of IBP. When 10 ppm IBP was added to the liquid media, where young hyphal colonies of P 2 were incubated, at the onset of incubation, the dry weight of colonies never increased during the 96 hr incubation. However, addition of 10 ppm IBP 24 hr after the onset of incubation resulted in prolongation of the lag phase. On the other hand, addition of IBP at 48 and 72 hr did not anffect the growth of hyphal mass at all. The initia 1 4 hr treatment of hyphal mass of P 2 with 10 ppm during incubation suppressed the increase of dry weight of hyphae prominently. It was also found that young hyphae obtained from the colony margin of P 2 were more sensitive to IBP than those obtained from the intermediate and central region of the colony. All these data suggest that the IBP effects on P. oryzae might be largely dependent on ages of hyphae, young hyphae being highly sensitive to IBP. Pyicularia oryzae Cav. の菌叢に及ぼすIBP(キタジンP) の影響を調べた。供試菌としてIBP感受性の分離株P 2 及び耐性のPT 83 を用いた。前者の菌糸から調製したプロトプラストを 10 ppm IBP含有のPDA培地に接種し，その上で伸長してきたコロニーを選抜して後者の株を得た。P 2 の菌叢の伸長はPDA上及びVogel液体培地中でそれぞれ 40, 20 ppm IBPによってほぼ完全に阻害された。一方いずれの培地を用いてもPT 83 の菌叢の伸長は 40 ppm存在下でも阻害されなかった。セロファン膜上のP 2 分生胞子の付着器形成は 5 ppm IBPで完全に阻害されたが，PT 83 の付着器形成は 50 ppm IBPでも完全には阻害されなかった。P 2 の若い菌糸を 10 ppm IBP含有液体培地で培養するとその後の菌体重の増加は見られなかった。また，培養開始 24 時間後にIBPを添加すると，対数増殖期の始まりが遅くなった。 しかし，培養開始後 48 時間以降にIBPを添加しても菌体重の増加には全く影響が現われなかった。一方，P 2 の菌叢を培養初期 4 時間のみ 10 ppm IBPで処理し，IBPを十分に洗浄した後に培養を続けると菌糸の伸長は顕著に抑制された。それ以下の短時間 IBP処理では菌糸伸長に影響は現われなかった。次に平面培地上で生育するP 2 の菌叢周縁部から中央部にかけて直後 6 mmの菌叢小円板をコルクボーラーで打ち抜き，それぞれ齢の異なる菌叢小円板を得た。これらを 20 ppm IBP含有の平面培地に移植して培養したところ，菌叢周縁部から得た小円板からのみ菌叢の発達が認められなかった。以上の結果は，P. oryzaeに及ぼすIBPの影響は菌叢を構成する菌糸の齢に関係しており，若い菌糸はIBP感受性が著しく高いことを示唆している...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel method {{to modify the}} near-infrared (NIR) reflectance of textile fabrics using colloidal self-assembly of polystyrene (PS) particles via electrostatic and convective forces. This work studies the effect of particle coating on a textile fabric where {{the size of the}} particle is of same order of magnitude as the incident wavelength of light, which has not been studied for textiles. Sulfate functionalized PS particles were deposited on cationic cotton, poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) coated nylon-cotton, and cationic <b>cellophane</b> <b>film.</b> The nylon-cotton fabric was obtained from the Army Camouflage Uniform (ACU) and contained three colors. Spherical particles of 0. 2, 0. 5, and 1. 0 ?m in diameter and a non-spherical, mushroom cap shaped particle, 1. 2 ?m in diameter, were used. The PS particles were deposited onto the substrates using aqueous suspensions. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to assess particle deposition on fibers. SEM revealed that the particles were able to conformally coat both nylon and cotton fibers despite their small radius of curvature. Micrographs showed two smaller particles had longer range, single layer coverage of particles on the fibers, while the larger particles were prone to agglomerate. The NIR reflectance of the PS particle coatings textiles materials was assessed using the testing method specified in the US Army standard MILDTL- 44436 A. NIR reflectance data was collected with a spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere to collect diffuse light scatter. The effect of the particle coating on the NIR reflectance was assessed using average reflectance spectra and principal component analysis (PCA). The spectra analysis showed that the change in reflectance on fabric substrates ranged from 0 to 6 units. The PCA effects test was used to confirm that the particle coatings significantly changed the reflectance of the substrates. The analysis also revealed that the particle size influenced the reflectance of the fabrics and that the mushroom cap particle behaved more similarly to the smaller spherical particle than the 1. 0 ?m particle. The PCA results also confirmed the dyes on the nylon-cotton substrate significantly altered the reflectance behavior. Potential improvements to the deposition procedure and particle selection for altering the reflectance of fabrics are also proposed...|$|E
