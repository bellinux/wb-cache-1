At the time, what was particularly novel about the Havana Charter was that many {{thought of it as}} an incipient world constitution of trade, employment and development. It is significant that the Charter was not simply or mainly a trade organization like the WTO, its latter day descendent. At its core, the countries of the world, rejected the idea {{that it was possible to}} maintain a firewall between trade, development, employment standards and domestic policy. Its most distinctive feature was the integration of an ambitious and successful program to reduce traditional trade barriers, with a wide-angled agreement that addressed investment, employment standards, development, business monopolies and the like. Among its many accomplishments is the landmark General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) rules that were negotiated as part of the ITO framework. Further, it created an open world trading order with scarcely a mention of free trade in the Charter or in the GATT. It also recognized the importance of labour standards and the developmental needs of the Southern nations in its Charter. Among its other successes, the ITO pioneered the idea that trade disputes had to be settled by <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> <b>mediation</b> rather than with legal clout.

Further it established an institutional linkage between trade and labour standards that would effect a major advance in global governance. Finally it embedded the full employment obligation, along with "a commitment to free markets" as the cornerstone of multilateralism. Despite these accomplishments, the US Congress refused to ratify the Havana Charter even though it had signed it. As a direct consequence, the ITO's collapse represented a significant closure of the full employment era internationally. In the end, it's demise made possible the rapid return of the free trade canon that increasingly, would impose its authority and ideology on all international organizations and on the practice of multilateralism. As this essay concludes, its history compelling because whatever its apparent shortcomings, governments, economists and ordinary people demanded that trade, employment goals and developmental needs should reinforce each other in the world trading system...|$|R
40|$|Beginning in 1999, {{a series}} of events {{generated}} speculation that the Chinese Party-state might be prepared to breathe new life into the country 2 ̆ 7 s long dormant constitution. In recent years, as the Party-state has strictly limited constitutional adjudication and moved aggressively to contain some citizen constitutional activism, this early speculation has turned to pessimism about China 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional trajectory. Such pessimism obscures recognition of alternative or hybrid pathways for resolving constitutional disputes in China. Despite recent developments, Chinese citizens have continued to constitutionalize a broad range of political-legal disputes and advance constitutional arguments in a variety of forums. This article argues that by shifting focus from the individual legal to the collective political dimension of constitutional law, a dimension dominant in China 2 ̆ 7 s transitional one-party state, we can better understand the significance of the constitution in China and identify patterns of bargaining, <b>consultation,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mediation</b> across a range of both intrastate and citizen-state constitutional disputes. Administrative reconciliation and 2 ̆ 2 grand mediation, 2 ̆ 2 dispute resolution models at the core of recent political-legal shifts in China, emphasize such consultative practices. This zone of convergence reveals a potential transitional path for resolving constitutional disputes. Specifically, the Party-state could choose to adapt and apply the grand mediation model in the context of constitutional disputes. Grand mediation involves a multilevel, Party-state political consultation that preserves a limited but meaningful role for the judiciary. An adaptation of the grand mediation framework would provide an indigenous dispute resolution model for resolving constitutional disputes, regularizing informal constitutional dispute resolution practices, and bringing judges to the constitutional interpretation table. At the same time, it would take account of the realities of China 2 ̆ 7 s current political environment. Chinese reformers could use such a mechanism (or existing informal dispute resolution practices) to advance their long-term goals of facilitating citizen-state <b>consultation,</b> reform concessions, <b>and</b> further the diffusion of constitutional norms through the Chinese polity...|$|R

This research was conducted {{in the village of}} River Raft Ekok Kulim District of Indragiri Hulu, which is the case in this thesis is the switch function Talang Mamak tribe indigenous forests into oil palm plantations aeral managed by a private company that is PT. Selantai Agro Lestari (SAL). Indigenous forest is actually set by the Government Indragiri Hulu along with the Regional Representatives Council Indragiri Hulu through SKB 31 /SKB/II/ 2007 Number and Number 180 /HK/II/ 2007 of 1800 hectares, thus causing conflict between communities and companies that establish oil palm plantations in the absence of land use permits (HGU) from the Ministry of Forestry. The study also looked at the efforts in the resolution of the conflict. This study used qualitative methods to conduct interviews and make observations to the study site in order to obtain data that would be material in this thesis. In the end, some conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study, namely, the establishment of oil palm plantations by private companies without any land use permits from the Ministry of Forestry, the presence of the sale and purchase of land by the public Talang Mamak, regional autonomy as the sustainability of forest destruction because, with facilitate the implementation of regional autonomy permits the release of such forestry Industrial Plantation Forest (HTI), Hak Guna Usaha (HGU) Mining License and others.

40|$|Labelling is a {{contentious}} issue within {{the fields of}} psychology and education and {{is influenced by the}} predominant medical and social models of disability labelling. Previous research has explored the views of children and parents in relation to the labels used to describe literacy difficulties. However, such research has neglected the views of children's mainstream teachers within the UK educational context. Drawing on an ecological perspective, this exploratory study investigated the views of four children aged 8 to 11 who had a dual placement at a centre for children with specific learning differences, their parents and their mainstream teachers. A qualitative methodology which utilised semi-structured interviews as a means of data collection investigated participants' views regarding the labels used to describe literacy difficulties, their perceived purpose and the meanings ascribed to them. Data was analysed using a hybrid approach of thematic analysis. Themes from the three data sets were collapsed allowing comparisons to be made. Findings indicated that there was variation in the labels used to describe the children's literacy difficulties although their meaning remained relatively constant. Labels were found to be transferable in nature, with adults not necessarily using those written in reports, where most of the labels originated. Adults perceived a need for collaboration in order to 'diagnose' dyslexia, with the role of the educational psychologist (EP) being central to this. Contrasting views regarding the purpose of a label, especially in relation to the support it could bring were found and although participants recognised that labels could provide an explanation, the visual signs of such difficulties were perceived as being important for the children interviewed. The findings are especially relevant {{to the role of the}} EP particularly since new recommendations have been proposed to the government regarding the identification of dyslexia (Rose, 2009). EPs are ideally placed to work with children, their parents and teachers and can draw on their skills in <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> <b>mediation</b> with the aim of developing a shared understanding of the child's difficulties whichever label is used...|$|R

40|$|Aim: This study {{aimed to}} explore and {{describe}} the barriers that elderly Lithuanians experience with respect to going to court or other institutions to defend their right not to be discriminated regarding medical care. Methods: We used a mixed methods approach due to the scarcity of information in Lithuania. First, the review of laws was done using the e-tar database and court cases were searched using the e-teismai database followed by policy analysis. Additional sources of information were identified searching Google Scholar and PubMed, as well as Google for grey literature. The keywords used were: ageism in patient care, discrimination against elderly, elderly and health (English and Lithuanian: 2000 - 2015). Secondly, we conducted in-depth individual interviews with 27 clients of newly-established integrated home care services: 13 elderly patients, and 14 informal caregivers. Results:  This study identified five groups of barriers explaining why Lithuanian elderly are hesitant to fight discrimination in the health system. The {{results of the study}} disclose the following barriers that the elderly in Lithuania face: i) the lack of recognition of the phenomenon of discrimination against the elderly in patient care; ii) the lack of information for complaining and the fear of consequences of complaining; iii) the deficiencies and uncertainties of laws and regulations devoted to discrimination; iv) the high level of burden of proof in court cases and lack of good practices; v) the lack of a patient (human) rights-based approach in all policies and in education as well as the lack of intersectoral work. Conclusions:  This study disclosed the need to: encourage training of legists and lawyers in expanding knowledge and skills in human rights in patient care;  encourage training of health care professionals – the burden of leadership for this has to be assumed by universities and public health professionals; incorporate a new article in the ‘Law on the rights of patients and compensation for the damage to their health’, clearly stating where to complain in case of discrimination; create a webpage and brochures with readable and understandable information for elderly persons and their families and caregivers; establish legal <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> <b>mediation</b> cabinets in health care facilities; establish an older persons’ rights protection service under the Ministry of Social Security and Labour in close cooperation with the Ministry of Health; promote sustainable results by incorporating a human rights-based approach regarding elderly persons in all policies...|$|R

This essay takes stock of research in the CMM tradition published during the 30 years since it was introduced, organizing it into five streams: (1) interpersonal and intercultural communication, (2) organizational communication and management, (3) public communication, (4) therapy <b>and</b> <b>consultation,</b> <b>and</b> (5) conflict, <b>mediation,</b> <b>and</b> dialogue. This research provides an impressive empirical basis for treating CMM as sensible (its concepts track onto empirical evidence) and useful (its principles and models help us decide know how to act into unfinished situations) in both research and practice. While our summary includes nearly 100 studies, this is not an overwhelming number, and the story is also one of missed opportunities, under-reported research, and prematurely abandoned research traditions. We characterize the evolution of CMM as a theory and the concomitant shifts in the research methods of choice, and suggest that future CMM research may take advantage of new textual, narrative, and discourse analytic methods as well as collaborative, participatory, and action research designs.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the role of}} consumer counselors in mediation of consumer disputes from a concept of the ADR. In consumer centers, consumer counselors provide consultation on consumer problems. The <b>consultation</b> includes advice <b>and</b> <b>mediation.</b> The consumer counselor has multiple roles for fair trading. She/he achieves not only the social justice but also the consumer's exercise of self-determination. So She/he acts evaluative and/or facilitative. The evaluative counselor assumes that the consumer wants and needs the counselor to provide some directions as to the appropriate grounds for settlement. The facilitative counselor assumes that the counselor does not take a decision, the parties themselves choose the means of resolving the dispute and play {{a more active role}} in this process in such a way they themselves to find the solution best suited to them. So the facilitative counselor draws out information or perspective or influence from the parties. Because the Evaluative-Facilitative/role of the counselor are the continuum, it is important that the counselor understands the role of mediator and appropriately employ the evaluative and/or facilitative strategies...|$|R
50|$|In {{the absence}} of {{centralised}} organization, some differences exist amongst Christadelphians on matters of belief and practice. This is because each congregation (commonly styled 'ecclesias') is organized autonomously, typically following common practices which have altered little since the 19th century. Most ecclesias have a constitution, which includes a 'Statement of Faith', a list of 'Doctrines to be Rejected' and a formalized list of 'The Commandments of Christ'. With no central authority, individual congregations are responsible for maintaining orthodoxy in belief and practice, and the statement of faith is {{seen by many as}} useful to this end. The statement of faith acts as the official standard of most ecclesias to determine fellowship within and between ecclesias, and as the basis for co-operation between ecclesias. Congregational discipline and conflict resolution are applied using various forms of <b>consultation,</b> <b>mediation,</b> <b>and</b> discussion, with disfellowship (similar to excommunication) being the final response to those with unorthodox practices or beliefs.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the role and impact of the committee staff of the South Korean National Assembly in the scrutiny of government bills. It also explores the factors affecting their role and impact focusing on the scrutiny of government bills. Parliamentary staff globally have not drawn much academic attention {{with the exception of}} those in the U. S., {{and it is difficult to}} apply the theories and concepts in American studies to staff in the legislatures of other countries due to the peculiarity of legislatures in the U. S. Moreover, previous literature on parliamentary staff has not given much attention to the roles of staff in <b>mediation</b> <b>and</b> negotiation between policy actors. This research sets out the framework consisting of macro-level institutions, network, actors and the interaction between actors, and uses the perspectives of policy network theory and new institutionalism to derive key concepts, in the context of the South Korean National Assembly, on the features of network; the capabilities and orientations of MPs and committee staff members; and historical contexts affecting the evolution of institutions. In order to collect and analyse empirical data, this research conducted qualitative interviews with 38 committee staff members; amendment analysis on 787 amendment opinions in the scrutiny of law bills; and legislative case studies on four cases of the legislative process. The thesis argues that the committee staff provide information and guide the scrutiny; consult with and mediate between policy actors; and play a limited role in setting the items of the subcommittee meetings. Generally speaking, the impact of them is found to be strong, as evidenced through the interview data and amendment analysis. This is because the orientation structures and capabilities of MPs and committee staff members are conducive to MPs’ delegation of detailed scrutiny to committee staff members; staff members’ participation; and MPs’ agreement with them according to the interview data. In addition, political controversy affects the role and impact negatively, but technical complexity affects positively according to the interview data and amendment analysis. These findings are also supported by the legislative case study. The committee staff conducted substantive roles in the scrutiny of uncontroversial bills, but their roles in amending bills were limited to the translation of the agreement between parties in the scrutiny of controversial bills although they specified detailed amendments and conducted scrutiny in the aspects of legal structure and wording in technically complex matters. The contributions of this research are as follows: First of all, it sheds lights on the network managing function of parliamentary staff generally and in Korea in particular in their roles such as <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> <b>mediation.</b> In addition, it also sheds light on the nature of issue as the factors affecting the role and impact of parliamentary staff differently. Last, but not least, it can be a base of comparative research on the legislative staff through studying non-partisan committee staff. The major limitation of this research is that it does not address whether the findings can be applied to the legislatures of other countries. This limitation is due to the peculiarity of South Korean National Assembly, although it shares some features of the legislative process with those in the U. K. and U. S. But then, this is a major problem with all kinds of comparative social science research and ought not to be an excuse not to engage with these important issues. Thus, the conduct of a comparative research about parliamentary staff of different countries with a consistent framework is suggested as the direction of future studies...|$|R
