5000|$|After {{publishing}} American Tabloid, Ellroy began a memoir, My Dark Places, {{based on}} his memories of his mother's murder, the unconventional relationship he had with her, and his investigation of the crime. In the memoir, Ellroy mentions that his mother's murder received little news coverage because the media were still fixated on the murder of mobster Johnny Stompanato, who was dating actress Lana Turner. Frank C. Girardot, a reporter for The San Gabriel Valley Tribune, accessed files on Geneva Hilliker Ellroy's murder from detectives with Los Angeles Police Department. Based on the <b>cold</b> <b>case</b> <b>file,</b> Ellroy and investigator Bill Stoner worked the case but gave up after 15 months, believing any suspects to be dead. In 2008, The Library of America selected the essay [...] "My Mother's Killer" [...] from My Dark Places for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime.|$|E
