40|$|Non-invasive {{single cell}} {{analyses}} are increasingly {{required for the}} medical diagnostics of test substances or the development of drugs and therapies on the single cell level. For the non-invasive <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells,</b> impedance spectroscopy which provides the frequency dependent electrical properties has been used. Recently, microfludic systems have been investigated to manipulate the single cells and to characterise the electrical properties of embedded cells. In this article, the impedance of partially embedded single cells dependent on the cellular behaviour was investigated by using the microcapillary. An analytical equation was derived to relate the impedance of embedded cells {{with respect to the}} morphological and physiological change of extracellular interface. The capillary system with impedance measurement showed a feasibility to monitor the impedance change of embedded single cells caused by morphological and physiological change of cell during the addition of DMSO. By fitting the derived equation to the measured impedance of cell embedded at different negative pressure levels, it was able to extrapolate the equivalent gap and gap conductivity between the cell and capillary wall representing the cellular behaviour...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. The {{non-invasive}} investigation of different cells to interact and become spatially organised in a three-dimensional (3 D) environment or scaffold {{is an important}} challenge in tissue engineering and tissue physiology. The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop 3 D cell culture systems using fibrin gels, which would allow for the single and co-culture of different cell types with in situ image analysis. Two chambers were constructed for mono-culture and co-culture of human dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes. During cell culture, in situ imaging and morphological <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> was assessed using brightfield light and/or fluorescence microscopy, and later confirmed by staining of fixed cells using immunofluorescence microscopy. The results showed that it was possible to investigate fibroblast and keratinocyte interactions in a fibrin scaffold for at least 12 days. Using this model system it was found that when a co-culture of fibroblasts and keratinocytes were plated on top of the fibrin gels, fibroblasts were seen to migrate into the gels within 2 – 3 days in contrast to keratinocytes, which did not enter. However, keratinocytes were found to retard fibroblast migration into gels when compared to fibroblasts cultured on their own, illustrating the dependency of intracellular communication on cell position for reconstructive approaches...|$|E
40|$|Background: Expression {{of signal}} {{transducer}} and activator of transcription 1 (STAT 1), the mediator of interferon (IFN) signalling, is raised in synovial tissue (ST) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Objectives: To {{determine the extent}} to which this pathway is activated by phosphorylation in RA synovium. Additionally, to investigate the cellular basis of STAT 1 activation in RA ST. Methods: ST specimens from 12 patients with RA and 14 disease controls (patients with osteoarthritis and reactive arthritis) were analysed by immunohistochemistry, using antibodies to STAT 1, tyrosine phosphorylated STAT 1, and serine phosphorylated STAT 1. Lysates of cultured fibroblast-like synoviocytes stimulated with IFNb were analysed by western blotting. Phenotypic <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> expressing STAT 1 in RA ST was performed by double immunolabelling for STAT 1 and CD 3, CD 22, CD 55, or CD 68. Results: Raised levels of total STAT 1 protein and both its activated tyrosine and serine phosphorylated forms were seen in RA synovium as compared with controls. STAT 1 was predominantly abundant in T and B lymphocytes in focal inflammatory infiltrates and in fibroblast-like synoviocytes in the intimal lining layer. Raised levels of STAT 1 are sustained in cultured RA compared with OA fibroblast-like synoviocytes, and STAT 1 serine and tyrosine phosphorylation is rapidly induced upon stimulation with IFNb. Conclusion: These results demonstrate activation of the STAT 1 pathway in RA synovium by raised STAT...|$|E

40|$|The <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> is an {{important}} point in the medical diagnostics {{due to the fact}} that many biological processes are characterized by the sequential appearance of certain cell constitutions. For this and other cell based applications a new biosensor based on the online monitoring of traction forces is developed. The sensor array which builds the connection base for the cells consist of 250, 000 micro pillars each with a diameter of 5 micro meter and a height of 25 micro meter. For the production of the sensor array a series process was chosen because of the large number of needed items. Further points for the selection of the micro injection moulding technology are the reproducibihty and the high precision of the produced parts. Cavities built by different manufacturing processes (silicon etching and UV-LIGA - UV-Lithography, galvano forming, replication) were tested as moulds for the pillar array. The filling of the micro pillars with a high aspect ratio is a challenging task for the micro injection moulding process. The behaviour of the processed material contributes to the challenge, due to the needed flexibility of the pillars. In order to manufacture these pillar arrays by micro injection moulding a complex variotherm moulding process under vacuum was developed. For the application as biological sensor the cells adhere on the sensor array with each focal adhesion point on one micro pillar. Cells are fluorescently labelled for observation. At suitable mechanical properties of the sensor array pillars bend due to the interaction with the cells. The cell position and pillar inclination can be detected with an optical system and with data analysis the interaction force can be calculated from the optical data...|$|E
40|$|Activation of the {{retinoblastoma}} protein (RB), by stresses such as ionizing radiation (IR) or hypoxia, causes a cell cycle arrest {{and has been}} suggested to convey therapeutic resistance to cancer cells. To investigate the cell signaling networks mediating RB activation, {{with the aim of}} uncovering potential targets for sensitisation of cancer cells, I developed and carried out a high-throughput RNA interference screen of the Dharmacon kinome-covering small interfering (si) RNA library. This identified seven siRNA gene targets required for RB activation in response to ionizing radiation; PRPK, PRKACG, STK 4, DYRK 1 A, HK 1, CDK 4 and p 21 -cip 1 /waf 1. Silencing of these genes effectively reduced the percentage of cells exhibiting G 1 -like characteristics after IR treatment. Two of these seven targeted genes, PRPK and STK 4, appear to be involved in IR-induced p 21 -cip 1 /waf 1 upregulation and silencing of these two genes sensitised colon carcinoma cells to radiation treatment. Biochemical <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> with PRPK knockdown revealed that its expression is required for p 53 upregulation and activation in response to IR. The work presented here provides first time evidence of a role for PRPK in the radiation response and implicates this gene product and the gene product of STK 4 as targets to sensitise cells to radiation. The work further identifies other gene products necessary for RB activation and G 1 /S checkpoint activation, yet ablation of these did not confer loss of p 21 -cip 1 /waf 1 induction or sensitisation to irradiation, indicating wiring of these gene products into mechanisms that promote radiation survival in the absence of RB activity and G 1 /S checkpoint control.

40|$|In {{any given}} media, {{the speed of}} sound is {{considerably}} slower than speed of light, and the exploration of the acoustic regime in the GHz range gives access to very short acoustic wavelengths. Short acoustic wavelengths is an intriguing path for high resolution live-cell imaging. At low frequencies, ultrasound {{has proved to be a}} valuable tool for the mechanical characterisation and imaging of biological tissues. There is much interest in using high frequency ultrasound to investigate single cells due to its mechanical contrast mechanism. Mechanical <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> has been performed by a number of techniques, such as atomic force microscopy, acoustic microscopy or Brillouin microscopy. Recently, Brillouin oscillations measurements on vegetal and mammal cells have been demonstrated in the GHz range. In this thesis, a method to extend this technique, from the previously reported single point measurements and line scans, into a high resolution acoustic imaging tool is presented. A novel approach based around a three-layered metal-dielectric-metal film is used as a transducer to launch acoustic waves into the cell being studied. The design of this transducer and imaging system is optimised to overcome the vulnerability of a cell to the exposure of laser light and heat without sacrificing the signal to noise ratio. The transducer substrate shields the cell from the laser radiation by detecting in transmission rather than reflection. It also generates acoustic waves efficiently by a careful selection of materials and wavelengths. Facilitates optical detection in transmission due to simplicity of arrangement and aids to dissipate heat away from the cell. The design of the transducers and instrumentation is discussed and Brillouin frequency images (two and three dimensions) on phantom, fixed and living cells are presented...|$|E

40|$|AIM: The {{presence}} <b>of</b> malignant <b>cells</b> in {{the blood}} and bone marrow of patients with cancer {{at the time of}} surgery may be indicative of early relapse. In addition to their numbers, the phenotypes <b>of</b> the micrometastatic <b>cells</b> might be essential in determining whether overt metastases will develop. This study aimed to establish a sensitive method for the detection and <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> malignant <b>cells</b> present in bone marrow. METHODS: In spiking experiments, SKBR 3 cells were mixed with mononuclear cells in known proportions to mimic bone marrow samples with micrometastatic cells. Tumour cells were extracted using SAM-M 450 Dynabeads coupled to the MOC- 31 anti-epithelial antibody, and were further analysed for amplification of erbB 2 and int 2 by fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH). erbB 2 and int 2 copy numbers were also determined in 15 primary breast cancers, and bone marrow samples from patients with amplification were analysed for micrometastatic cells by immunomagnetic enrichment and FISH. RESULTS: In model experiments, cells with amplification could be detected in bead selected fractions when ratios <b>of</b> tumour <b>cells</b> (SKBR 3) to mononuclear cells were as low as 10 : 10 (7). Among the tumour samples, eight showed increased copy numbers of erbB 2 and/or int 2, and three of these patients had detectable numbers <b>of</b> tumour <b>cells</b> in their bone marrow: 4000, 540, and 26 tumour cells/ 10 (7) mononuclear cells, respectively. The patient with 540 tumour cells/ 10 (7) mononuclear cells showed high level amplification of erbB 2 and suffered from a particularly aggressive disease, whereas the patient with 4000 tumour cells/ 10 (7) mononuclear cells had favourable disease progression.

The commercial and economic importance of this industry has resulted in an increasing interest in the biology of this particular shellfish genus. In this study we focus on the identification of structural, functional and proliferative proteins in two species of abalone shellfish, Haliotis discus hannai and Haliotis tuberculata. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that react with proteins in vertebrate and invertebrate tissues were selected and applied to abalone tissues.

Much <b>of</b> the <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> ensheathing <b>cell</b> property has developed from immunohistochemical {{studies that have been}} supplemented with new molecular methodologies in recent years.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} six {{methods to}} improve the <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> solar <b>cells</b> via photoluminescence techniques. The first two methods use photoluminescence images under combined voltage bias and illuminations to calculate spatially resolved essential parameters. These quantitative images of parameters such as current density, dark saturation current density J 01 and J 02 and efficiency are useful to check the location and magnitude of the defects. Therefore the performance <b>of</b> the solar <b>cell</b> could be well-characterised using these approaches. The third method is the series resistance separation method. A series resistance image can be separated into natural and defect-related components. Through this, the series resistance <b>of</b> the solar <b>cell</b> can be better understood. The fourth method is {{the front and rear}} defect separation method. By utilising this method, the vertical <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> solar <b>cells</b> can be achieved. The fifth method is the area calculation method. This method calculates the active area and total area of the solar cell; and simultaneously, the position of the active area is recorded, which can be used for further analysis. The sixth method is the voltage and effective lifetime imaging method. The core advantages of this method are that it virtually eliminates the horizontal balancing current when the cell is on open-circuit and no calibration is required. All the methods explained in this thesis are feasible for use in industry. This is because all the methods only require an existing commercial photoluminescence system and no additional equipment is needed.

For this reason, the applicability of analytical protocols in the qualitative and quantitative <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> nanophase fuel <b>cell</b> electrocatalysts was investigated. A set of structural and chemical properties influencing {{the performance of the}} electrocatalysts was identified. A large range of analytical tools was employed in characterising the electrocatalysts of interest. High accuracy and precision in the quantitative and qualitative structural and electrochemical <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> Pt/C and Pt-Ru/C nanophase electrocatalysts was demonstrated. Certain techniques were deemed to be highly applicable in discriminating between high- and low-performance electrocatalysts based on their structural and electrochemical properties. The goal of this effort is to {{contribute to the development of}} South Africa’s capabilities in the emerging hydrogen economy...|$|R
40|$|Titanocene {{compounds}} are a novel {{series of}} agents that exhibit cytotoxic effects {{in a variety}} <b>of</b> human cancer <b>cells</b> in vitro and in vivo. In this study, the antiproliferative activity of two titanocenes (Titanocenes X and Y) was evaluated in human epidermoid cancer cells in vitro. Titanocenes X and Y induce apoptotic cell death in epidermoid cancer cells, with IC 50 values that are comparable to cisplatin. <b>Characterisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cell</b> death pathway induced by titanocene compounds in A 431 cells revealed that apoptosis is preceded by cell cycle arrest and the inhibition <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation. The induction of apoptosis {{is dependent on the}} activation of caspase- 3 and - 7 but not caspase- 8. Furthermore, the antitumour activity of Titanocene Y was tested in an A 431 xenograft model of epidermoid cancer. Results indicate that Titanocene Y significantly reduced the growth of A 431 xenografts with an antitumour effect similar to cisplatin. These results suggest that titanocenes represent a novel series of promising antitumour agents...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{motility}} is {{an essential}} process {{in the development of}} all organisms. The earliest stages of embryonic development involve massive reconfigurations <b>of</b> groups <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> to form the early body structures. Embryos are very complex systems, and therefore to investigate the molecular and cellular basis of development a simpler genetically tractable model system is used. The social amoeba Dictyostelium Discoideum is known to chemotax up a chemical gradient. From previous work, it is clear that cells generate forces in the nN range. This is above the limit of optical tweezers and therefore we are investigating the use of acoustic tweezers instead. In this paper, we present recent progress of the investigation in to the use of acoustic tweezers for the <b>characterisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> motility and forces. We will describe the design, modelling and fabrication of several devices. All devices use high frequency (> 15 MHz) ultrasound to exert a force on the cells to position and/or stall them. Also, each device is designed to be suitable for the life-sciences laboratory where form-factor and sterility is concerned. A transducer (LiNo) operating at 24 MHz excites resonant acoustic modes in a rectangular glass capillary (100 um by 2 mm). This device is used to alter the directionality <b>of</b> the motile <b>cells</b> inside the fluid filled capillary. A quarter-ring PZT 26 transducer operating at 20. 5 MHz is shown to be useful for manipulating cells using axial acoustic radiation forces. This device is used to exert a force on cells and shown to pull them away from a coverslip. The presented devices show promise for the manipulation <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> in suspension. Currently the forces produced are below that required for adherent cells; the reasons for this are discussed. We also report on other issues that arise when using acoustic waves for manipulating biological samples such as streaming and heating...|$|R
