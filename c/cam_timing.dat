25|$|The {{timing of}} the {{camshaft}} can be advanced to produce better low RPM torque, or retarded for better high RPM power. Changing <b>cam</b> <b>timing</b> moves the overall power produced by the engine down or up the RPM scale. The amount of change is very little (usually < 5 deg), and affects valve to piston clearances.|$|E
25|$|On January 16, 2013, Ecutek {{also became}} the first company to {{construct}} and offer Flex Fuel hardware and software capability for all Nissan GTRs. This fuel kit requires the Ecutek specific TCM. The kit provides changes in the cold start cranking compensation, changes to the maximum target boost, changes in the ignition timing, changes to target airflow, changes in <b>cam</b> <b>timing,</b> {{and changes in the}} fuel economy gauge reading all based solely on ethanol content in the gas tank.|$|E

500|$|New six {{cylinder}} {{sedan and}} utility models {{were added to}} the range, the F6 Typhoon (sedan) and F6 Tornado (ute). The F6 was visually separated from the GT range {{with the use of a}} different pattern in the front bumper grill mesh, and a smaller boot spoiler on the Typhoon. They were powered by FPV's version of the Ford Falcon Barra engine, a 4.0-litre DOHC 24-valve turbocharged inline-six with variable <b>cam</b> <b>timing.</b> It produced [...] at 5250rpm and [...] at 2000–4250rpm.|$|E
500|$|Powerplants {{consisted}} of both straight-sixes and V8s, with the entry-level Barra 182 six-cylinder being {{a significant improvement}} over the AU Falcon's six. The base model engine contained substantial mechanical changes such as dual infinitely variable <b>cam</b> <b>timing</b> for a gain of [...] of power {{for a total of}} [...] The Barra 182 can also take advantage of higher octane fuels, where a small increase of torque can be achieved. The [...] LPG-only Barra E-Gas engine was offered as an option on lower specification models.|$|E
2500|$|For 2011, {{the aging}} 4.0L V6 {{used in the}} Mustang since the 2005 model year was {{replaced}} with Ford's Duratec 37 3.7L DOHC V6. Unlike earlier versions of the engine, the new V6 featured Twin-independent Variable <b>Cam</b> <b>Timing</b> (Ti-VCT), true dual exhaust (compared to the single outlet exhaust for the previous 4.0L V6); this engine was rated to produce a much-improved [...] @ 6500rpm and [...] of torque @ 4250rpm.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{generation}} ZZR600 (ZX-6 Ninja in different continents/markets) was updated in 1993 with lighter and bigger valves and intake-exhaust ducts, more permanence in the <b>cams</b> <b>timing,</b> lighter pistons, ram air. The two parts chassis (aluminium frame and steel sub-frame) {{changed to a}} one piece full aluminium chassis, and aesthetic changes.Analogue instrumentation included standard speedometer on the left that rose in single MPH increments up to 170. Unlike the Suzuki competitor, the Katana, signal lights on the Kawasaki's cluster were amber instead of green. Owners could also rely on a fuel gauge on the left (missing on D series) and a temperature gauge on the right which many motorcycles {{in the same class}} did not have at the time. Storage was minimal, but better than most sport bikes. There was room beneath the seat for the manual and registration, but not much else. An additional compartment could be found {{on the left side of}} the fairing and the ignition key was needed to open it.|$|R
40|$|Valve timing {{strategies}} {{aimed at}} producing internal exhaust gas re-circulation {{in a conventional}} spark ignition, SI, engine have recently demonstrated the ability to initiate controlled auto-ignition, CAI. Essentially the exhaust valves close early, to trap a quantity of hot exhaust gases in-cylinder, and the fresh air-fuel charge is induced late into the cylinder and then mixing takes place. As a logical first step to understanding the fluid mechanics, {{the effects of the}} standard and modified valve timings on the in-cylinder flow fields under motored conditions were investigated. Laser Doppler anemometry has been applied to an optical engine that replicates the engine geometry and different valve <b>cam</b> <b>timings.</b> The cycle averaged time history mean and RMS velocity profiles for the axial and radial velocity components in three axial planes were measured throughout the inlet and compression stroke. The turbulent mixing for the two cases are described in terms of the flow field maps of the velocity vectors, vorticity and turbulence kinetic energy and the integrated tumble ratio as a function of crankangle...|$|R
2500|$|Not {{unlike other}} Harley-Davidson engines, the unit {{construction}} {{left and right}} engine cases split vertically, and formed four cavities: a center front crankcase, a center rear gearbox, a right side cavity gearcase [...] for the timing train, where the four camshafts are housed, and a left cavity for the three row primary drive chain. A row of four camshafts had also been used on the KR racers, inherited from the sidevalve Model WL, and even earlier Model D of 1929. While the single camshaft of other Harley-Davidson designs was cheaper to manufacture, and quieter, four cams allowed better performance, such as greater flexibility in adjusting the <b>cam</b> <b>timing,</b> and the short single camshafts are durable, and give the pushrods a straighter path to the rocker arms.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in late 2010 (for the 2011 model year), the Mustang GT's {{engine was}} an all-aluminum 32-valve 5.0L DOHC V8, codenamed Coyote. The 2011 Mustang GT marked the engine's first use in any {{production}} Ford. While the new engine's displacement {{was similar to}} Ford's original [...] "5.0" [...] V8, it was an unrelated design and instead shared {{more in common with}} the 4.6L V8 and other Modular engines that it replaced. The new 5.0 used a DOHC head design like other Modular engines and even shared its bore spacing and deck height with the outgoing 4.6L V8. Differing the new engine from earlier Modular engines, among other features, was its use of wider bore diameters (and a longer stroke relative to the 4.6L V8 in particular), to allow the use of larger valves, and camshaft torque-actuated Twin-independent Variable <b>Cam</b> <b>Timing</b> (Ti-VCT). This more advanced design is approximately [...] – about heavier than the Mustang GT's previous 4.6L V8. Red-line had been raised to 7,000 rpm. Using premium grade, 91-octane or better gasoline, the new 5.0L V8 could produce [...] @ 6500rpm and [...] of torque @ 4250rpm. Output of the 5.0 drops to [...] @ 6500rpm and [...] of torque @ 4250rpm when regular grade gasoline is used.|$|E
5000|$|This {{ratio is}} higher with more {{conservative}} (i.e., earlier, soon after BDC) intake <b>cam</b> <b>timing,</b> and lower with more radical (i.e., later, long after BDC) intake <b>cam</b> <b>timing,</b> but always {{lower than the}} static or [...] "nominal" [...] compression ratio.|$|E
5000|$|It has an {{aluminum}} block with {{an aluminum}} head. The K20Z3 has traditional performance VTEC cams on the intake and the exhaust <b>cams.</b> Variable valve <b>timing</b> technology is {{included on the}} intake but not the exhaust cams. The added valve timing control corresponds to the added [...] "i" [...] in i-VTEC.|$|R
50|$|Interchange:1991-1993 {{models were}} Multi-port injection, {{and had a}} single crank sensor for {{computer}} timing. 1994-1995 models used the same long block, but had different <b>cam</b> carriers and <b>timing</b> cover.1996-1997 models used {{a modified version of}} the same short block and had different heads.91-93 motors cannot be used in later models due to lack of sensors needed for the newer computer systems.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This work {{deals with}} the kineto-elastodynamic {{modelling}} of a mechanism for rocking motion with a <b>cam</b> and <b>timing</b> belt drives, used in a high-performance automatic packaging machine. A lumped-parameter model is presented, having five degrees of freedom and taking account of non-linearities. Equations of motion are numerically integrated, using the finite difference method. Model parameters are evaluated {{on the basis of}} design data and measurements of the actual motion of the output link. Finally the model is satisfactory validated by comparison with experimental results. The model makes it possible to relate the design and functional parameters of the mechanism to its dynamic behaviour; thus it is used to detect the causes of the dynamic phenomena that reduce performances...|$|R
5000|$|The GT-S was {{powered by}} the 2ZZ-GE engine rated at [...] at 7600 rpm and 133 lbft Nm torque at 6800 rpm. The engine {{featured}} Toyota’s VVTL-i (Variable Valve Timing and Lift control with intelligence). A second stage valve lift control for intake {{was added to the}} variable intake <b>cam</b> phase <b>timing.</b> Variants of this engine were offered in the Matrix XRS, Corolla XRS and the Lotus Elise (with a Lotus ECU which added 10 bhp). Buyers had the option of a four-speed automatic with shift buttons on the steering wheel, or a six-speed manual. The base tire size was 205/55/15 but the optional size offered was 205/50/16. The tire upgrade was merely [...] so most GT-S models had the optional wheels and tires. All GT-S models had four-wheel disc brakes and metal pedals.

5000|$|In 2007, the L61 {{received}} {{a multitude of}} changes, that originated from the LE5. It switched to the higher-strength Gen II block and {{received a}} revised cylinder head (enlarged exhaust ports) and camshaft design (increased exhaust valve duration). The engine also switched from wasted spark ignition to individual coil-on-plug ignition, this forced the cam cover to be redesigned. It was also switched to an E37 engine controller with new crank and <b>cam</b> sensors (replacing <b>timing</b> sensor previously found in ignition cassette).

50|$|The {{crankcase}} {{was made}} by machining two triple cases and then welding them together before the final machining was done. The cylinder block, the head and camboxes were all produced in the same way, but the crankshaft was built up and the camshafts specially made and carried <b>cams</b> with mild <b>timing.</b> Most other parts were from the triple or twin suitably modified where necessary. It pulled a top gear of 4.2 to 1 and ran to nearly 125mph with the mild cams. (Courtesy “Triumph Twins and Triples” by Roy Bacon).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} computational results obtained on the Ford Barra 190 4. 0 litres I 6 gasoline engine {{and on the}} Ford Falcon car equipped with this engine. Measurements of steady engine performance, fuel consumption and exhaust emissions were first collected using an automated test facility {{for a wide range}} of <b>cam</b> and spark <b>timings</b> vs. throttle position and engine speed. Simulations were performed for a significant number of measured operating points at full and part load by using a coupled Gamma Technologies GT-POWER/GT-COOL engine model for gas exchange, combustion and heat transfer. The fluid model was made up of intake and exhaust systems, oil circuit, coolant circuit and radiator cooling air circuit. The thermal model was made up of finite element components for cylinder head, cylinder, piston, valves and ports and wall thermal masses for pipes. The model was validated versus measured steady state air and fuel flow rates, cylinder pressure parameters, indicated and brake mean effective pressures, and temperature of metal, oil and coolant in selected locations. Computational results agree well with experiments, demonstrating the ability of the approach to produce fairly accurate steady state maps of BMEP and BSFC, as well as to optimize engine operation changing geometry, throttle position, <b>cam</b> and spark <b>timing.</b> Measurements of the transient performance and fuel consumption of the full vehicle were then collected over the NEDC cycle. Simulations were performed by using a coupled Gamma Technologies GT-POWER/GT-COOL/GT-DRIVE model for instantaneous engine gas exchange, combustion and heat transfer and vehicle motion. The full vehicle model is made up of transmission, driveshaft, axles, and car components and the previous engine model. The model was validated with measured fuel flow rates through the engine, engine throttle position, and engine speed and oil and coolant temperatures in selected locations. Instantaneous engine states following a time dependent demand for torque and speed differ from those obtained by interpolating steady state maps of BSFC vs. BMEP and speed. Computational results agree well with experiments, demonstrating the utility of the approach in providing a more accurate prediction of the fuel consumption over test cycles. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Precipitation {{variability}} is {{analyzed in}} {{two versions of}} the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM), the standard model, CAM, and a “multiscale modeling framework ” (MMF), in which the cumulus parameter-ization has been replaced with a cloud-resolving model. Probability distribution functions (PDFs) of daily mean rainfall in three geographic locations [the Amazon Basin and western Pacific in December–February (DJF) and the North American Great Plains in June–August (JJA) ] indicate that the CAM produces too much light–moderate rainfall (10 20 mm day 1), and not enough heavy rainfall, compared to observa-tions. The MMF underestimates rain contributions from the lightest rainfall rates but correctly simulates more intense rainfall events. These differences are not always apparent in seasonal mean rainfall totals. Analysis of 3 – 6 -hourly rainfall and sounding data in the same locations reveals that the CAM produces moderately intense rainfall as soon as the boundary layer energizes. Precipitation is also concurrent with tropospheric relative humidity and lifted parcel buoyancy increases. In contrast, the MMF and observations are characterized by a lag of several hours between boundary layer energy buildup and precipitation, and a gradual increase in the depth of low-level relative humidity maximum prior to rainfall. The environmental entrainment rate selection in the CAM cumulus parameterization influences <b>CAM</b> precipitation <b>timing</b> and intensity, and may contribute to the midlevel dry bias in that model. The resulting low-intensity rainfall in the CAM leads to rainfall–canopy vegetation interactions that are different from those simulated by the MMF. The authors present evidence suggesting that this interaction may artificially inflate North American Great Plains summertime rainfall totals in the CAM. 1...|$|R
