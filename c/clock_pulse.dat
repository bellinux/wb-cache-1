50|$|After each <b>clock</b> <b>pulse,</b> {{the signal}} lines inside the CPU {{need time to}} settle to their new state.

50|$|In {{synchronous}} logic circuits, {{an electronic}} oscillator generates a repetitive series of equally spaced pulses called the clock signal. The clock signal {{is applied to}} all the memory elements in the circuit, called flip-flops. The output of the flip-flops only changes when triggered by {{the edge of the}} <b>clock</b> <b>pulse,</b> so changes to the logic signals throughout the circuit all begin at the same time, at regular intervals synchronized by the clock. The output of all memory elements in a circuit is called the state of the circuit. The state of a synchronous circuit changes only on the <b>clock</b> <b>pulse.</b> The changes in signal require {{a certain amount of time}} to propagate through the combinational logic gates of the circuit. This is called propagation delay. The period of the clock signal is made long enough so the output of all the logic gates have time to settle to stable values before the next <b>clock</b> <b>pulse.</b> As long as this condition is met, synchronous circuits will operate stably, so they are easy to design.|$|E

40|$|Based on a {{worst case}} analysis, {{clocking}} schemes for high-performance systems are analyzed. These are 1 - and 2 -phase systems using simple clocked latches, and 1 -phase systems using edge-triggered D-flip-flops. Within these categories (any {{of which may}} be preferable in a given situation), it is shown how optimal tradeoffs can be made by appropriately choosing the parameters of the clocking system {{as a function of the}} technology parameters. The tradeoffs involve the clock period (which determines the data rate), and the tolerances that must be enforced on the propagation delays through the logic. Clock-pulse edge tolerances are shown to be an important factor. It is seen that, for systems using latches, their detrimental effects on the clock period can be converted to tighter bounds on the short-path delays by allowing D changes to lag behind the leading edges of the <b>clock</b> <b>pulses</b> and by using wider <b>clock</b> <b>pulses</b> or, in the case of 2 -phase systems, by overlapping the <b>clock</b> <b>pulses.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
