50|$|<b>Exit</b> <b>planning</b> is the {{preparation}} for the exit of an entrepreneur from his company to maximize the enterprise value of the company in a mergers and acquisitions transaction and thus his shareholder value, although other non-financial objectives may be pursued including the transition of the company to the next generation, sale to employees or management, or other altruistic, non-financial objectives. <b>Exit</b> <b>planning</b> differs from succession planning in that the later is a sub-component of <b>exit</b> <b>planning,</b> and refers to the hiring, training and retention of a successor President/CEO of the company in a planned manner. Succession Planning {{is but one of}} the many considerations when conducting <b>exit</b> <b>planning.</b> Company owners commonly do not see their company from the standpoint of a potential buyer, and thus, ignore the strategic management of the company.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} health plan competition and pricing {{in order to understand}} the dynamics of health <b>plan</b> entry and <b>exit,</b> in the presence of switching costs and alternative health premium payment systems. We build an explicit model of death spirals, in which profit-maximizing competing health plans find it optimal to adopt a pattern of increasing relative prices culminating in health <b>plan</b> <b>exit.</b> We find the steady-state numerical solution for the price sequence and the plan’s optimal length of life through simulation and do some comparative statics. This allows us to show that using risk adjusted premiums and imposing price floors are effective at reducing death spirals and switching costs, while having employees pay a fixed share of the premium enhances death spirals and increases switching costs...|$|R
40|$|Retirement {{experiences}} are highly individual and associated research is complex, characterised by many different perspectives. The thesis proposed that retirement research can advance with conceptual frameworks to integrate knowledge on retirement, flexible theory to explain diverse experiences, and analytic techniques to precisely test study aims. First, the Preretirement Transition Adaptation (PTA) framework was developed as an overarching conceptual framework that can connect the main themes in retirement research, define {{the scope of}} new investigations, and identify avenues for future research. Second, the theoretical framework of the thesis identified that resources influence diverse individual outcomes in retirement. Third, regression, structural equation modelling (SEM), and SEM-based longitudinal analysis methods were used to test hypotheses. Investigations focused on the role that preretirement <b>planning,</b> <b>exit</b> conditions, and resources played in producing positive retirement experiences. Cross-sectional investigations drew on a sample of retired and semi-retired individuals, ranging from 49 to 88 years old, and having spent five or more years in retirement on average (N = 583). Participants who completed this survey were invited to nominate themselves for participation in future research rounds (N = 433). Longitudinal investigations {{were based on a}} subsample of the original population (N = 367), who completed three survey rounds, representing a response rate of 85 %. Cross-sectional studies showed that preretirement <b>planning,</b> <b>exit</b> conditions, and resources were stronger predictors than demographics of three related retirement outcomes. In a structural equation model, resources predicted outcomes and also improved preretirement <b>planning</b> and <b>exit</b> conditions. Further, preretirement <b>planning</b> indirectly and <b>exit</b> conditions directly improved retirement outcomes. Longitudinal investigations identified subgroups that displayed distinct patterns of growth in life satisfaction and showed that resource-change matched the direction of life satisfaction growth within these subgroups. Overall, results demonstrated the importance of resources in producing positive retirement experiences, in line with contemporary theory. Opportunities to build on these results in the future and implications for developing our thinking about retirement, improving research approach, and informing the design of interventions and policy are discussed...|$|R
