5|$|The insect <b>circulatory</b> <b>system</b> {{utilizes}} hemolymph, {{a tissue}} analogous to blood that circulates {{in the interior}} of the insect body, while remaining in direct contact with the animal's tissues. It is composed of plasma in which hemocytes are suspended. In addition to hemocytes, the plasma also contains many chemicals. It is also the major tissue type of the open <b>circulatory</b> <b>system</b> of arthropods, characteristic of spiders, crustaceans and insects.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we propose}} a new chaotic {{itinerant}} model of mode transition dynamics in human <b>circulatory</b> <b>systems.</b> An essential {{emphasis of the}} model is on autonomous mode transition based on chaotic itinerancy of large-scale nonlinear systems. It is shown that the model possesses some important properties observed in the <b>circulatory</b> <b>systems,</b> such as mode transition and its controllability. Copyright c© 2005 IFA...|$|R

5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} <b>circulatory</b> <b>system,</b> meaning a <b>circulatory</b> <b>system</b> divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. The double system allows blood to circulate to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.|$|E
5|$|C. elegans is an unsegmented pseudocoelomate, and lacks a {{respiratory}} and a <b>circulatory</b> <b>system.</b> It possesses gut granules which emit {{a brilliant}} blue fluorescence, {{a wave of}} which is seen at death in a 'death fluorescence'.|$|E
5|$|The blood {{volume of}} the lungs, is about 450 millilitres on average, about 9 per cent of the total blood {{volume of the}} entire <b>circulatory</b> <b>system.</b> This {{quantity}} can easily fluctuate from between one-half and twice the normal volume.|$|E

5|$|In {{the naming}} scheme as {{originally}} developed, these substems mostly {{consist of a}} consonant, a vowel, then another consonant. The final letter may be dropped if the resulting name {{would be difficult to}} pronounce otherwise. Examples include -ci(r)- for the <b>circulatory</b> <b>system,</b> -li(m)- for the immune system (lim stands for lymphocyte) and -ne(r)- for the nervous system. The final letter is usually omitted if the following source substem begins with a consonant (such as -zu- or -xi-), but not all target substems are used in their shortened form. -mul-, for example, is never reduced to -mu- because no chimeric or humanized antibodies targeting the musculoskeletal system ever received an INN. Combination of target and source substems results in endings like -limumab (immune system, human) or -ciximab (<b>circulatory</b> <b>system,</b> chimeric, consonant r dropped).|$|E
5|$|Insect {{respiration}} {{is accomplished}} without lungs. Instead, the insect respiratory system uses {{a system of}} internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the <b>circulatory</b> <b>system</b> is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect <b>circulatory</b> <b>system</b> has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of {{little more than a}} single, perforated dorsal tube that pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity. Air is taken in through openings {{on the sides of the}} abdomen called spiracles.|$|E

5|$|Like other insects, {{grasshoppers}} {{have an open}} <b>circulatory</b> <b>system</b> {{and their}} body cavities are filled with haemolymph. A heart-like structure in {{the upper part of}} the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the <b>circulatory</b> <b>system</b> is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration is performed using tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal muscles to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have {{a closed}} <b>circulatory</b> <b>system,</b> where the blood remains inside blood vessels. Octopuses have three hearts; a {{systemic}} heart that circulates blood round {{the body and}} two branchial hearts that pump it through {{each of the two}} gills. The systemic heart is inactive when the animal is swimming and thus it tires quickly and prefers to crawl.|$|E

5|$|The {{heart is}} a muscular organ in most animals, which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the <b>circulatory</b> <b>system.</b> Blood {{provides}} the body with oxygen and nutrients, as well as assists in the removal of metabolic wastes.

5|$|The substem {{preceding}} {{the source of}} the antibody refers to the medicine's target. Examples of targets are tumors, organ systems like the <b>circulatory</b> <b>system,</b> or infectious agents like bacteria or viruses. The term target does not imply what sort of action the antibody exerts. Therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic agents are not distinguished by this nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have an open}} <b>circulatory</b> <b>system</b> that bathes {{the organs}} in hemolymph. The heart has three chambers: two {{auricles}} receiving blood from the gills, and a single ventricle. The ventricle is muscular and pumps hemolymph into the aorta, {{and then to the}} rest of the body. Some bivalves have a single aorta, but most also have a second, usually smaller, aorta serving the hind parts of the animal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—For the {{development}} of cardiovascular devices {{and the study of}} the dynamics of blood flow through the cardiovascular system, hardware fluidic models are commonly used to minimize animal experiments and clinical trials. These <b>systems,</b> called “mock <b>circulatory</b> <b>systems,</b> ” are also critical for {{the development}} of ventricular assist devices. The passive and active elements in these systems are frequently “hard-plumbed ” and are difficult to modify in experimental studies. Therefore, we propose a concept of novel fluidic operational amplifier comprised of a high-gain feedbackcontrolled gear pump. With pressure being the analog of voltage, design with the fluidic op-amp is analogous to electrical op-amp circuit design. Initial computer and hardware simulation results demonstrate that the device may be programmed for use in mock <b>circulatory</b> <b>systems</b> to emulate the function of the energy sources (the ventricles) or passive networks (hemodynamic loads).

5|$|One complication—unintentional and unrecognized {{intubation}} of the esophagus—is both common (as frequent as 25% in {{the hands}} of inexperienced personnel) and likely to result in a deleterious or even fatal outcome. In such cases, oxygen is inadvertently administered to the stomach, from where it cannot be taken up by the <b>circulatory</b> <b>system,</b> instead of the lungs. If this situation is not immediately identified and corrected, death will ensue from cerebral and cardiac anoxia.|$|E
