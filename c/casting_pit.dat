It {{revealed}} the foundations and lower parts of the walls of the monastery buildings and the abbey church. Important finds included: a Norman doorway; a finely carved arcade; a floor of mosaic tiles, the largest floor area of this type to be found in any modern excavation; the remains of the kiln where the tiles were fired; a bell <b>casting</b> <b>pit</b> used for casting the bell; and a large medieval statue of SaintChristopher.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side of the bailey are the remains of the Norman chapel, which {{comprised}} a nave, a square tower and an apsidal chancel, 12.7 metres by 6 metres (42ft by 20ft), 4 metres square (13ft square) and 4.6 metres by 4 metres (15ft by 13ft) respectively. It was built from local grey sandstone, and Roman tiles from one of the nearby villas were used to construct its roof and incorporated into the walls. Originally the tower would have had a church bell, and the <b>casting</b> <b>pit</b> for this is buried under the floor of the nave. A stone bench runs around the base of the walls, and in the 19th century there was also a stone base for a font in the nave, but this has since been lost. A piece of early medieval graffiti, possibly depicting a Norman soldier, has survived on the south exterior wall. A fireplace was added to the chapel during the Tudor period, although this was only in use for a few years before being abandoned.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, Jaigarh Fort, which is located 150 miles {{south-west}} of Delhi, became one of the world's most efficient cannon foundries mainly due to the abundance of iron ore mines {{in the vicinity of the}} fort. The cannon foundry Jaigarh Fort had a massive wind tunnel that sucked air from the high mountains into its furnace creating temperatures as high as 2400°F, the heated air would melt the metal. The liquid molten metal would fill a reservoir chamber and into a cannon mold in the <b>casting</b> <b>pit.</b> Most of those cannons were massive, mostly 16ft long and had to be prepared within a single day. The Rajput also built a large ingenious mechanical device that had a precision gear system driven by four pairs of oxen, the device was used for hollowing out the cannon barrels. When the Mughal war of succession broke out in 1658 Dara Shikoh secured the cannon outpost of Jaigarh Fort until he was defeated and executed by his younger brother Aurangzeb. Later however, the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah appointed Jai Singh II as the official Mughal Qiladar of Jaigarh Fort according to a Firman, ultimately Jai Singh II is known to have molded the great Jaivana Cannon by utilizing the important foundry and devices inside Jaigarh Fort.|$|E

50|$|During the 1800s the Stannington area {{together}} with the nearby Loxley Valley became an important producer of refractory bricks for the expanding Sheffield steel industry. The bricks were used to line the furnaces and were made from ganister, a sort of sandstone and from fireclay from the Stannington pot clay seam which was prevalent in the area. Many ganister and fireclay mines and quarries existed in the area with the major ones being owned by the local firms of Siddons Brothers. (High Matlock Road ganister quarry) and J & J Dyson (firebrick works, Griff's Works, Stopes Road) which sprang up in the district. Refractory production ceased in 2012.

50|$|Pyhäsalmi {{mine was}} {{worked as an}} open <b>cast</b> <b>pit</b> until 1967, when {{underground}} mining operations commenced. In 1975, open cast mining was stopped. During the years the underground mine has been made gradually deeper. The so-called Olli Shaft was completed in 1985, making the mine 730 m deep. New ore was discovered yet deeper, and a depth of 1050 m was reached in 1996. Later a new shaft, called Timo Shaft was built to exploit the ore deposit between 1050 and 1440 m. Timo Shaft's construction work completed in 2001. By 2003, 38.2 million tons of ore have been processed, containing 1.2% copper, 3.1% zinc, gold 0.46 grams per ton, and silver 14.6 grams per ton. 15.6 million tons of ore remained.|$|R

50|$|The hardest and strongest bronze {{contains}} {{large amounts}} of tin and little lead though an alloy with more than 25 per cent tin will have a low melting point and become brittle and susceptible to cracking. This low melting point {{proved to be the}} nemesis of Russia's third attempt at casting the Tsar Bell from 1733 to 1735. The bell was never rung, and a huge slab cracked off (11.5 tons) during a fire in the Kremlin in 1737 before it could ever be raised from its <b>casting</b> <b>pit.</b> Burning timber fell into the <b>casting</b> <b>pit</b> and the decision was whether to let it burn and risk melting the bell, or to pour water on it and risk causing it cracking from cooling it too quickly. The latter risk was chosen and, as feared, because of the low melting point of the bronze and uneven cooling, the bell was damaged. The present bell is sometimes referred to as Kolokol III (Bell III), because it is the third recasting; remnants from the old bell were melted down and the metal re-used to cast the new bell. This practice was fairly commonplace, as the metal materials were very costly. Bell metal was considered so valuable that the first bronze coins for England were made in France out of melted-down old bells.|$|E

50|$|After {{the outer}} steel mantle has been cleaned, {{it is again}} lowered over the outer bell model. The mantle and the outer bell mould are then lowered over the inner mould and the outer and inner {{sections}} are clamped together, leaving a space between them. The clamped mould is supported, by being buried in a <b>casting</b> <b>pit</b> which bears the weight of metal and allows even cooling. Ingots of either ready-made bronze or its component metals are melted in a melting furnace and heated until liquid at a temperature of approximately 1100 C. The liquid metal is then skimmed to remove impurities {{before the start of}} the casting process. When everything is ready, the molten bronze is transferred to the moulds using either ladles or a system of brick channels specially constructed in the <b>casting</b> <b>pit,</b> through which the hot metal can then flow from the melting furnace into the space between the two moulds. Holes in the top of the mantle ensure that gases are able to escape. If gas remained in the metal, the bell would be porous and susceptible to cracking. Porousness can also develop if the mould is damp, is not at the proper temperature, or if the metal, when poured, is not hot enough. The bell is allowed to cool for several days. Large bells can take over a week to cool completely. Small bells, those under 500 lb, can be removed from the moulding pit the following day.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{before the}} last {{ornamentation}} was completed, a major fire broke out at the Kremlin in May 1737. The fire spread to the temporary wooden support structure for the bell, and fearing damage, guards threw cold water on it, causing eleven cracks, and a huge 10432.6 kg slab to break off. The fire burned through the wooden supports, and the damaged bell fell back into its <b>casting</b> <b>pit.</b> The Tsar Bell remained in its pit for almost a century. Unsuccessful attempts to raise it were made in 1792 and 1819.

50|$|A pit 10 m deep was dug (near the {{location}} of the present bell), with a clay form, and walls reinforced with rammed earth to withstand the pressure of the molten metal. Obtaining the necessary metals proved a challenge, for in addition to the parts of the old bell, an additional 525 kg of silver and 72 kg of gold were added to the mixture. After months of preparation, casting work commenced at the end of November 1734. The first attempt was not successful, and the project was incomplete when Ivan Motorin died in August, 1735. His son Mikhail carried on the work, and the second attempt at casting succeeded on November 25, 1735. Ornaments were added as the bell was cooling while raised above the <b>casting</b> <b>pit</b> through 1737.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fire brick}} company Thomas Wragg & Sons owned a Pot Clay mine {{immediately}} to the south east of the hamlet. Pot Clay is the impure version of Ganister and was in demand in the Sheffield steel industry to make bricks for the lining of furnaces. In the early 1970s the mine was producing 15,000 tons of clay per year, with the company quoting, “The mine can be worked at the present rate for 100 years”. A refractory brick works stood {{at the entrance to}} the mine. However the Ughill mine had drainage problems and although powerful pumps had been installed in the 1950s to pump between 600 and 800 gallons per minute from the mine, the mine closed on 17 November 1977. It had become uneconomic to mine the clay due to water problems and the owners found it more profitable to bring in clay from the Midlands. The site of the mine has been landscaped and returned to agricultural use. [...] J&J Dyson mined fireclay at their open cast quarry at Wheatshire between Ughill and Sugworth. The quarry is closed but can still be seen from the nearby road. Thos. Wragg had small firebrick works at Load Brook (closed 1957) and Brookside (Stopes Road, Stannington, closed 1960) the former previously owned by the Trickett family, the latter by the Drabble family and a major works (Old Wheel Brick Works) in the nearby Loxley Valley. Wraggs along with its local competitors, J&J Dyson of Griffs Works, Stannington and Thos.
