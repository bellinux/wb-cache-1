25|$|The second oldest stone lantern in Japan, {{found at}} Kasuga Shrine, is a yūnoki-dōrō or <b>citron</b> <b>tree</b> stone lantern.|$|E
25|$|This style {{goes back}} to at least as the Heian period. The post has rings carved at the bottom, middle and top, and the {{hexagonal}} base and middle platform are carved with lotuses. The umbrella is simple and has neither warabite nor an ukebana. The yunoki seems to stem from a <b>citron</b> <b>tree</b> that used to stand near the lantern at Kasuga Shrine. This type of lantern became popular in tea house gardens during the Edo Period.|$|E

Cornflower is an {{attribute}} of Christ and symbolizes Heaven while hyssop symbolizes both the humility of Christ and baptism. There is a <b>citron</b> <b>tree</b> in the background, which represents the Cedar of Lebanon. Michelangelo uses the hyssop and tree as a visual representation of a quote by Rabanus Maurus, [...] "From the Cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop which grows on a stony wall we have {{an explanation of the}} Divinity which Christ has in his Father and of the humanity that he derives from the Virgin Mary."

25|$|While <b>citron</b> <b>trees</b> {{are still}} found on Corfu, and in Naxos, the citron {{is no longer}} {{exported}} from Greece for the ritual purpose. The Crete citron growers sell it for the candied peel, which is called succade, and in Naxos it is distilled into a special aromatic liqueur called kitron.|$|R
50|$|Kitron {{comes in}} three varieties. The green variety is sweeter and {{contains}} less alcohol. The yellow variety {{is the strongest}} and has the least sugar. Clear Kitron is somewhere in between, and is perhaps the best for a new drinker to sample.The drink was briefly fashionable during the early 1980s, but {{is difficult to find}} today outside Naxos due to a shortage of <b>citron</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|R

Delicious odours of lime and <b>citron</b> <b>trees,</b> and well-nigh forgotten herbage, filled his nostrils, and the twitter of birds thrilled his ears, seeming to bid him welcome to the land, as he sank down on the soft grass, and raised his eyes in thanksgiving to heaven. An irresistible tendency to sleep then seized him.|$|R
2500|$|By the 11th century, {{it appears}} that the town had once again been {{developed}} into a fortified city. Writing in 1047, Nasir-i-Khusraw describes it as [...] "a fine city, with running waters, and palm-gardens, and orange and <b>citron</b> <b>trees.</b> Its walls are strong, and it has an iron gate. There are fountains that gush out within the city". [...] This is in agreement with William of Tyre's description of the Crusaders' siege in 1101, mentioning catapults and siege engines used against the city fortifications.|$|R

He brought her to a feast and demanded of everyone what should be done to anyone who would harm her. Various people said various things; the slave said she should be burned, and so the prince had the slave burned.|$|E

60|$|As soon as {{they got}} over the brow of the hill, they {{discovered}} {{it to be a}} really immense orchard, extending for miles to the right and left of them. As their way led straight through the trees, they hurried forward as fast as possible. The first trees they came to bore quinces, which they did not like. Then there were rows of <b>citron</b> <b>trees</b> and then crab apples and afterward limes and lemons. But beyond these they found a grove of big, golden oranges, juicy and sweet, and the fruit hung low on the branches so they could pluck it easily.|$|R

5000|$|Citron {{was also}} {{described}} by Pliny the Elder, who called it nata Assyria malus. The following is {{from his book}} Natural History:There is another tree also with the same name of [...] "citrus," [...] and bears a fruit that is held by some persons in particular dislike for its smell and remarkable bitterness; while, on the other hand, {{there are some who}} esteem it very highly. This tree is used as an ornament to houses; it requires, however, no further description.The <b>citron</b> <b>tree,</b> called the Assyrian, and by some the Median apple, is an antidote against poisons. The leaf {{is similar to that of}} the arbute, except that it has small prickles running across it. As to the fruit, it is never eaten, but it is remarkable for its extremely powerful smell, which is the case, also, with the leaves; indeed, the odour is so strong, that it will penetrate clothes, when they are once impregnated with it, and hence it is very useful in repelling the attacks of noxious insects.The tree bears fruit at all seasons of the year; while some is falling off, other fruit is ripening, and other, again, just bursting into birth. Various nations have attempted to naturalize this tree among them, for the sake of its medical properties, by planting it in pots of clay, with holes drilled in them, for the purpose of introducing the air to the roots; and I would here remark, once for all, that it is as well to remember that the best plan is to pack all slips of trees that have to be carried to any distance, as close together as they can possibly be placed.It has been found, however, that this tree will grow nowhere except in Media or Persia. It is this fruit, the pips of which, as we have already mentioned, the Parthian grandees employ in seasoning their ragouts, as being peculiarly conducive to the sweetening of the breath. We find no other tree very highly commended that is produced in Media.Citrons, either the pulp of them or the pips, are taken in wine as an antidote to poisons. A decoction of citrons, or the juice extracted from them, is used as a gargle to impart sweetness to the breath. The pips of this fruit are recommended for pregnant women to chew when affected with qualmishness. Citrons are good, also, for a weak stomach, but it is not easy to eat them except with vinegar.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the area}} of primary domestication, {{the fruit of the}} <b>citron</b> <b>tree</b> (Citrus medica L.), and to a limited extent its leaf and flower, have {{traditionally}} been used as a raw condiment, candied, or more rarely, salted. In {{the area of}} secondary domestication – the hot Mediterranean climate – culinary uses multiplied during an active phase of cultivar development in the 10 to 16 th centuries. In the 19 th century, citron products were widely used in the gastronomy of Northern Europe, mainly in sweet dishes. The establishment and dissemination by the Tintori nursery in Tuscany of a remarkable collection of citron trees and, later, the appearance on markets of the fingered ‘Buddha׳s Hand’ cultivar revived interest in <b>citron</b> <b>tree</b> products. Initial results from a methodical examination of their current culinary applications reveal a positive contribution to savoury cuisine as a result of contemporary cooking, maceration and extraction techniques. Cultivars are selected specifically for these different uses. The use of steam extraction to create “citron floral water” (hydrosol) is promising...|$|E
50|$|While Calabria {{is at the}} {{southern}} point of Italy, and its climate most Mediterranean, {{it is the most}} suitable for the citron. Even though, during the winter it is still too cold for the citron; this is why the farmers need to protect them with blue or green plastic covers. Most of the <b>citron</b> <b>trees</b> in the area are grafted onto foreign citrus rootstock, in order to save them from frost and disease. This practice renders their fruits non-kosher for the Sukkot ritual, and therefore in order for a mashgiach to certify a citron as kosher, he must first carefully inspect the tree to confirm it was not grafted.|$|R

'Then, having {{delivered}} the boxes and letters we had brought for him from Auckland, {{we went into}} his house, gazing with delight at cocoanut trees, bananas, breadfruit <b>trees,</b> <b>citrons,</b> lemons, taro, &c., with bright tropical colouring thrown over all, lighting up the broad leaves and thick foliage of the trees around us.|$|R
60|$|The night {{drawing on}} apace, I ascended up a tree, and slept very comfortably, {{though it was}} the first time I had lain out of my habitation. And when the morning came, I {{proceeded}} with great pleasure on my way, travelling about four miles, as I imagined, by the length of the valley, directing my course northward, there being a ridge of hills on the south and north side of me. At the end of this valley, I came to an opening, where the country seemed to descend to the west; there I found a little spring of fresh water, proceeding out of the side of the hill, with its chrystal streams running directly east. And, indeed, here my senses were charmed with the most beautiful landscape nature could afford; for the country appeared flourishing, green, and delightful, that to me it seemed like a planted garden. I then descended on the side of that delicious vale, when I found abundance of cocoa, orange, lemon, and <b>citron</b> <b>trees,</b> but very wild and barren at that time. As for the limes, they were delightful and wholesome, the juice of which I after used to mix in water, which made it very cooling and refreshing. And now I was resolved to carry home and lay up a store of grapes, limes, and lemons, against the approaching wet season. So laying them up in separate parcels, and then taking a few of each with me, I returned to my little castle, after having spent three days in this journey. Before I got home, the grapes were so bruised that they were utterly spoiled; the limes indeed were good, but of those I could bring only a few.|$|R
50|$|Ponderosa lemon is {{not widely}} grown commercially, {{but it is}} {{commonly}} grown as an ornamental plant. In areas where the winter's cold may damage the plant, they are grown in containers. In such cases they are usually grafted to dwarf rootstocks to help maintain a smaller, more manageable size. The impressive sized fruits may be left on the tree for many months after they've ripened without {{a drop in the}} fruits' quality. In addition, like <b>citron,</b> Ponderosa lemon <b>trees</b> can flower and bear fruit at the same time, further adding to the visual appeal.|$|R
60|$|It {{was fairly}} dark {{a few minutes}} after we got within the wall, and we rode long {{distances}} through wonderfully crooked streets, eight to ten feet wide, and shut in on either side by the high mud-walls of the gardens. At last we got to where lanterns could be seen flitting about here and there, and knew we {{were in the midst of}} the curious old city. In a little narrow street, crowded with our pack-mules and with a swarm of uncouth Arabs, we alighted, and through a kind of a hole in the wall entered the hotel. We stood in a great flagged court, with flowers and <b>citron</b> <b>trees</b> about us, and a huge tank in the centre that was receiving the waters of many pipes. We crossed the court and entered the rooms prepared to receive four of us. In a large marble-paved recess between the two rooms was a tank of clear, cool water, which was kept running over all the time by the streams that were pouring into it from half a dozen pipes. Nothing, in this scorching, desolate land could look so refreshing as this pure water flashing in the lamp-light; nothing could look so beautiful, nothing could sound so delicious as this mimic rain to ears long unaccustomed to sounds of such a nature. Our rooms were large, comfortably furnished, and even had their floors clothed with soft, cheerful-tinted carpets. It was a pleasant thing to see a carpet again, for if there is any thing drearier than the tomb-like, stone-paved parlors and bed-rooms of Europe and Asia, I do not know what it is. They make one think of the grave all the time. A very broad, gaily caparisoned divan, some twelve or fourteen feet long, extended across one side of each room, and opposite were single beds with spring mattresses. There were great looking-glasses and marble-top tables. All this luxury was as grateful to systems and senses worn out with an exhausting day's travel, as it was unexpected--for one can not tell what to expect in a Turkish city of even a quarter of a million inhabitants.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have had}} some {{pleasant}} occupation {{for an hour or}} so each day in clearing away the bush, which in one year grows up surprisingly here. Many lemon, <b>citron,</b> and orange <b>trees</b> that we planted some years ago. cocoa-nut trees also, were almost, some quite overgrown, quite hidden, and our place looked and was quite small and close; but one or two hours for a few days, spent in clearing, have made a great difference. I have planted out about twenty-five lemon suckers, and as many pine-apples, for our old ones were growing everywhere in thick clumps, and I have to thin them out.|$|R
60|$|I {{spent all}} that evening there, and went not {{back to my}} habitation; which, by the way, was the first night, as I might say, I had lain from home. At night, I took my first contrivance, and got up into a tree, where I slept well; {{and the next morning}} {{proceeded}} on my discovery, travelling near four miles, as I might judge by the length of the valley; keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and north sides of me. At the end of this march I came to an opening, where the country seemed to descend to the west; and a little spring of fresh water, which issued {{out of the side of}} the hill by me, ran the other way, that is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, so flourishing, every thing being in a constant verdure, or flourish of spring, that it looked like a planted garden. I descended a little on the side of that delicious vale, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure (though mixed with other afflicting thoughts,) to think that this was all my own; that I was king and lord of all this country indefeasibly, and had a right of possession; and, if I could convey it, I might have it in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in England. I saw here abundance of cocoa trees, and orange, lemon, and <b>citron</b> <b>trees,</b> but all wild, and very few bearing any fruit; at least not then. However, the green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but very wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made it very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing. I found now I had business enough to gather and carry home; and I resolved to lay up a store, as well of grapes as limes and lemons to furnish myself for the wet season, which I knew was approaching. In order to this, I gathered a great heap of grapes in one place, a lesser heap in another place; and a great parcel of limes and melons in another place; and, taking a few of each with me, I travelled homeward; and resolved to come again, and bring a bag or sack, or what I could make to carry the rest home. Accordingly, having spent three days in this journey, I came home (so I must now call my tent and my cave:) but before I got thither, the grapes were spoiled; the richness of the fruits, and the weight of the juice, having broken and bruised them, they were good for little or nothing: as to the limes, they were good, but I could bring only a few.|$|R
60|$|In {{the centre}} of the kingdom lay its capital, the {{beautiful}} city of Granada, sheltered, as it were, in the lap of the Sierra Nevada, or Snowy Mountains. Its houses, seventy thousand in number, covered two lofty hills with their declivities and a deep valley between them, through which flowed the Darro. The streets were narrow, as is usual in Moorish and Arab cities, but there were occasionally small squares and open places. The houses had gardens and interior courts, set out with orange, <b>citron,</b> and pomegranate <b>trees</b> and refreshed by fountains, so that as the edifices ranged above each other up the sides of the hills, they presented a delightful appearance of mingled grove and city. One of the hills was surmounted by the Alcazaba, a strong fortress commanding all that part of the city; the other by the Alhambra, a royal palace and warrior castle, capable of containing within its alcazar and towers a garrison of forty thousand men, but possessing also its harem, the voluptuous abode of the Moorish monarchs, laid out with courts and gardens, fountains and baths, and stately halls decorated in the most costly style of Oriental luxury. According to Moorish tradition, the king who built this mighty and magnificent pile was skilled in the occult sciences, and furnished himself with the necessary funds by means of alchemy.* Such was its lavish splendor that even at the present day the stranger, wandering through its silent courts and deserted halls, gazes with astonishment at gilded ceilings and fretted domes, the brilliancy and beauty of which have survived the vicissitudes of war and the silent dilapidation of ages.|$|R
