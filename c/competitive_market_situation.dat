40|$|The paper {{argues that}} the problem of obesity can usefully be seen as {{illustrating}} a new kind of market failure.

40|$|Future {{plans for}} energy {{production}} in the European Union {{as well as other}} locations call for a high penetration of renewable technologies (20 % by 2020, and higher after 2020). The remaining energy requirements will be met by fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Smaller, less-capital intensive nuclear reactors are emerging as an alternative to fossil fuel and large nuclear systems. Approximately 50 small to medium-sized reactors (SMRs) concepts are being pursued for use in electricity and cogeneration (combined heat and power) markets. However, many of the SMRs are at the early design stage and full data needed for economic analysis or market assessment is not yet available. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to develop "should cost" estimates for reactors deployed in a range of <b>competitive</b> <b>market</b> <b>situations</b> (electricity prices ranging from 45 - 150 Euros/MWh). Parametric analysis was used to develop a cost breakdown for reactors that can compete against future natural gas and coal (with/without carbon capture) and large nuclear systems. Sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the impacts on competitiveness from key cost variables. This study suggests that SMRs may effectively compete in future electricity markets if their capital costs are controlled, favorable financing is obtained, and reactor capacity factors match those of current light water reactors. This methodology can be extended to cogeneration markets supporting a range of process heat applications. JRC. DDG. F. 7 -Energy systems evaluatio...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} is to study whether the official rhetoric on the role that cooperatives could play {{in the quest for}} agricultural modernisation in Uganda have any resemblance with how farmers view the benefits and problem with cooperation. This question was motivated by the political initiative in the early 21 st century to revive the cooperative movement in Uganda, a movement burdened with a history of political intervention and difficulties to adapt to a de-regulated agricultural market system. In the thesis, the move to revive the cooperative movement is linked to another more encompassing political initiative, that of the modernisation and commercialisation of small-scale agriculture. The book consists of two empirical studies, where interviews and text analysis have been important research methods. By first analysing the rhetoric emanating from political institutions and donor agencies, the conclusion is drawn that cooperatives are seen primarily as an institutional device which, it is hoped, will fill spaces that have been abandoned by the state and not filled with private sector initiatives. A focused case study of a dairy cooperative and a number of its members in Uganda shows that farmers’ expectations of the cooperative to some extent converge with those revealed in the first study: for example they expected the cooperative to provide a stable outlet for their production of milk. The interviews and quantitative analysis indicate that farmers’ preferences for both fast cash and a stable income can create incentives for members to free-ride on the collective efforts of their fellow members. This can be cumbersome in a <b>competitive</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>situation</b> where other buyers compete with the cooperative for the members’ produce. The cooperative can find it difficult to secure a necessary level of member commitment if members do not share a common code of conduct...|$|R

Small and medium sized enterprises range between 10 and 250 employees. FiveSwedish SMEs {{was used for the}} multi case study. Background: The <b>competitive</b> <b>market</b> <b>situation</b> has created a shift in companies’ strategythinking. Strategies focus increasingly on core activities and business development. Oneeffect of this is that companies choose to outsource activities they don´t consider to be corebusiness (Van Weele, 2010; Thrulogachantar and Zailani, 2011). Purpose: The purpose was to investigate strategic sourcing plans that SMEs can apply toincrease their competitive advantage. Methodology: The research was conducted through a qualitative study with a deductiveapproach. A multi-case study was made on five SMEs in Kronobergslän, Sweden, with twosemi-structured interviews at each company. Result and conclusion: The investigation resulted in a current view of SMEs sourcing andsuitable recommendations for SMEs to direct their purchasing activities to strategic sourcing. The process of implementing a strategic plan for SMEs can be seen as relatively difficult butthere are purchasing activities that can be improved by a strategic thinking. To keep in mind isthat supplier’s performance matter, but it is the resources of suppliers that are the maincompetitive advantage and it is in this area where supplier development and sourcingstrategies should focus.

40|$|Facility {{location}} {{concerns the}} placement of facilities, for various objectives, by use of mathematical models and solution procedures. Almost all facility location models {{that can be found}} in literature are based on minimizing costs or maximizing cover, to cover as much demand as possible. These models are quite efficient for finding an optimal location for a new facility for a particular data set, which is considered to be constant and known in advance. In a real world situation, input data like demand and travelling costs are not fixed, nor known in advance. This uncertainty and uncontrollability can lead to unacceptable losses or even bankruptcy. A way of dealing with these factors is robustness modelling. A robust facility location model aims to locate a facility that stays within predefined limits for all expectable circumstances as good as possible. The deviation robustness concept is used as basis to develop a new competitive deviation robustness model. The competition is modelled with a Huff based model, which calculates the market share of the new facility. Robustness in this model is defined as the ability of a facility location to capture a minimum market share, despite variations in demand. A test case is developed by which algorithms can be tested on their ability to solve robust facility location models. Four stochastic optimization algorithms are considered from which Simulated Annealing {{turned out to be the}} most appropriate. The test case is slightly modified for a <b>competitive</b> <b>market</b> <b>situation.</b> With the Simulated Annealing algorithm, the developed competitive deviation model is solved, for three considered norms of deviation. At the end, also a grid search is performed to illustrate the landscape of the objective function of the competitive deviation model.

The recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) combined with a <b>competitive</b> <b>market</b> <b>situation</b> have encouraged Dell to research new opportunities. Al research and breakthroughs have risen in the last years, bringing along revolutionary technologies and companies that are disrupting all businesses. Over 30 potential concepts for Al integration at Dell Inc. were identified and evaluated to select the ones with the highest potential. The top-most concept consisted of preventing in real time the failure of hardware. This concept was investigated using a data science process. Currently, there exist a number of machine learning tools that automate the last stages of the proposed data science process to create predictive models. The utilized tools vary in functionality and evaluation standards, but also provide other services such as data and model storage and visualization options. The proposed solution utilizes the deep feature synthesis algorithm that automatically generates features from problem-specific data. These engineered features boosted predictive model accuracy by an average of 10 % for the AUC and up to 250 % in recall for test (out of sample) data. The proposed solution estimates an impact exceeding $ 407 M in the first five years for Dell Inc. and all of the involved suppliers. Conservatively, the direct impact on Dell Inc. is particular to batteries under warranty and is expected to surpass $ 2. 7 M during the first five years.

40|$|Typescript. Bibliography: leaves 104 - 119. Microfiche. [ix], 119 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmOne of {{the major}} {{complaints}} about the liner conference system has been that conferences are cartels collectively setting prices to maximize their profits. The complaint centers around the pricing behavior that has caused inefficiency and involved the misallocation of resources. A number of models have been offered to explain the conference pricing behavior. These include neo-classical models based upon the profit-maximization hypothesis and alternative model, Unfortunately, few of these models have been satisfactory. Overall, they fail to satisfactorily consider multi-product shipping services and {{take into account the}} quality of services as well as non-conference competition. Following the current state-of-the-art, this study has developed a fully-specified model considering the price interrelationships between the conference and non-conference sectors. However, simplified assumptions are necessary because the information necessary for the test of this model is not always readily available. Two simplified models are developed in this study. One is the dominant-firm price-leadership model which considers the market residual demand as a constraint and the other one is the price-constrained model which assumes that the non-conference competition puts a ceiling on the conference freight rates. The latter consists of a two-equation system. The "first equation" is for the situation where the conference does not face strong competition and acts as a price-maker while the "second equation" where it does and acts as a price-taker. This model has confirmed that the inelastic demand for the conference transport services can not be an evidence rejecting the profit-maximization hypothesis as long as the quality of services is one of the decision variables of the conference. In the meantime, the conference "value-of- service" pricing practice is also consistent with the <b>competitive</b> <b>market</b> <b>situation.</b> The empirical test of these simplified models using regression analysis based upon the data pertaining to the Latin American exports shows the structure of the conference freight rates is consistent with either the price-leadership model or the price-constrained model. The conference acts as a price-maker or price-leader for the high-value commodities and as a price-taker for the low-value ones...|$|E

The origin of value and the two main contemporary theories of customer value were reviewed; some models were covered as well. The two theories are Customer-based value theory and value chain theory, both of them discussed the importance of customer value, but value chain theory focus on the internal value creation activities and linkages. The value chain theory links the value activities to business strategy, addresses the nature and determinants of competitiveness, and it offers a useful framework for analyzing value chain and deciding value proposition choices. Customer-based value theory explores value creation from the customer perspectives. It demonstrates that the value propositions of organizations should be aligned with the customer perceptions for the value. After reviewing the relevant literature, the debates were found and some propositions are made about the subjects of value proposition as extended research area of existing theories. The organization in construction material industry –Lafarge Gypsum China Company was selected to be interviewed, qualitative research are carried out once the subjects were identified. The research methods of customer interview, sales focus group, marketing team interview and participant observation are adopted {{in order to get a}} sufficient view and evidence to discuss the subjects.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} a perennial theme in both public and academic debate: how ownership is exercised in the news media. It does so by exploring the main agency through which ownership control {{is expected to be}} exerted in the individual media firm: the board of directors. Establishing the board as an intermediary between owners and the executive and editorial management, the study addresses a number of questions pertaining to the role of media boards: who is elected to the boards; which decisions are made in the boardroom, and which are not; who influences them, and who does not. The empirical results come from a historical study of the Swedish newspaper industry. The Swedish press has long been characterized by close ties to the political arena. A more recent characteristic is the growing dominance of not-for-profit foundations as owners of newspapers. It is the consequence of this particular ownership form that is the main focus of the dissertation. The study analyzes the boards of three local, foundation-owned newspapers between 1955 and 2005. The newspapers are Barometern (Kalmar), Borås Tidning (Borås) and Sundsvalls Tidning (Sundsvall). The study builds primarily on two sources: minutes from over twelve-hundred board meetings and meetings of shareholders, and interviews with twenty-three former and current board members. The study shows that the governance processes, including both the role played by the individual board and the relative autonomy of the editorial department, have differed significantly between the three cases. The distinct characteristics have been reinforced not only {{by the fact that the}} newspapers are old and exceedingly mature institutions, but also as a result of a very slow circulation of members of the top echelons of the newspaper organizations. Consequently, the most noticeable shifts in the activities and power structures of the companies have followed from the entering of new decision-makers into the organizations. A basic conclusion is thus that there is no single answer concerning the ramifications of foundation ownership in the press. As a result of an increasingly <b>competitive</b> <b>market</b> <b>situation,</b> the companies have since the early 1990 s nevertheless come to be increasingly dominated by professional managers and board members, making the traditional governance features less distinct. The process has been spurred by the fact that all three newspapers have been transformed from independents to parts of expanding newspaper groups. As a result, much of the allocative control previously enjoyed by the local boards has been transferred to central levels of the corporate hierarchy...|$|E
40|$|Product {{development}} in the automotive industry is typically characterised by cross-functional teamwork. At the same time, the organisation and development culture are in many ways component-oriented, and, indeed, highly advanced {{from the point of}} view of component development. As a result, most components themselves are relatively mature. However, product concepts and systems are often assemblies of traditional components. This means that there is an evident potential in moving the central point of the development process towards early phases, to focus on concept and system design, and thus bring about more efficient product integration. Furthermore, it is essential for a car manufacturer, or other industrial companies dealing with complex products, to have the ability to develop products in which a large number of product features and properties have to be incorporated. Besides, competition will continually force companies to reduce development and product costs while the product value as seen by the customer has to increase. Furthermore, in a marketplace which is flooded with similar products, innovation and product renewal are of vital importance for securing the long-term survival of the operations. In this complex development context, and with this <b>competitive</b> <b>market</b> <b>situation,</b> it is more important than ever to support the development of attractive and innovative products, while adequately considering relevant requirements in a cost-efficient way. Reflecting these opportunities, which can be seen as strategic, there is an increased need for knowledge on concept development and requirements management, as well as an increased interest in using structured work procedures, such as systematic design methods presented in academia. However, although the industrial needs and the application potential are evident, few methods and tools presented in academia have been widely adopted in industry. Thus, it is highly relevant to possess knowledge of how to apply new methods and tools, as well as knowing about potential effects. It also desirable to develop methods and tools that are more considerate of industrial needs. In line with the scope presented and a multidisciplinary research approach used, the knowledge that emerged in this research project extends from descriptive to prescriptive, and from contextual to general. More specifically, the project contributes a deeper understanding of practical product development with a focus on system design and requirements management, as well as design methodology and support tools to design multi-technology products, including experiences from their application in industrial, cross-functional teams. Furthermore, recommendations and guidelines are formulated, including improvement proposals to suit the needs of the automotive industry or other industrial sectors dealing with complex products. Specific phenomena identified might, in addition, point out directions for future product development research and theory development. The conclusions drawn indicate that the research matter is not just a choice of black or white. The general conclusion is that structured approaches, including systematic design methodology and related computer-based tools, essentially support concept development and requirements management, but always have to be applied in a flexible way and be adapted to the situation at hand. In addition, the risk of formalistic influences has to be attended to, for the benefit of fruitful co-operative development.

40|$|The New Zealand meat {{industry}} has been undergoing significant changes during the past decade. These changes have prompted the carrying out {{of research on the}} New Zealand meat industry and the likely development of new marketing systems. This paper deals with an investigation carried out with a view to recommending an improved marketing system relevant to the situation faced by the industry in the 1980 's. The research involved extensive interviews with senior management in many of the firms involved in the New Zealand meat industry and, from those interviews, the identification of the characteristics of the various sectors of the industry and the problems faced by the industry, especially in the marketing field. The survey of the industry was carried out between June and October 1981. From the results of the survey it was possible to identify two general sectors within the New Zealand meat industry. One sector is characterised by its ownership of killing facilities and the second sector is characterised by its marketing orientation. This second sector identified as a major problem the obtaining of product for its marketing operation. With the exception of this area, however, there was a high degree of consensus within the industry regarding the problems faced. A major problem identified by almost everyone interviewed was the instability of the United Kingdom lamb market. Since the United Kingdom market is often used as an indicator in the setting of prices in other markets, this instability can affect prices received for a large proportion of total New Zealand lamb exports. New markets were seen as presenting a further group of problems. Some are single buyer markets, and there is much concern as to the appropriate methods of supplying meat and setting prices for these markets. In other new markets there is a fear that market development is being stifled because of the inability of exporters to recoup market development costs. As soon as a market is developed to the stage where returns can be expected which are fully comparable with returns from other markets, new firms which have no need to recoup development costs enter the market. A third problem area which was identified by some was the development of vertical integration within the New Zealand meat industry. Firms which were once concerned only with the marketing of lamb have, largely because of worries about their ability to obtain meat for export, entered the field of killing and processing. On the other hand there is a feeling that some companies whose strength and major expertise lies in the operation of meat works have engaged in marketing largely because the meat is available to them. They may increase their perceived return by this action, but their marketing return may not be as high as that which could be achieved by a specialist company. Less specialisation within the industry may mean that the efficiency with which certain operations are carried out is reduced. When that possibility exists we cannot be sure that we are obtaining the highest possible returns from our meat for the nation. As a major step towards overcoming many of the problems outlined above, it is suggested that a carcase meat market be established in New Zealand through which the bulk of our carcase meat should be required to pass. Such a market would mean that all carcase meat was available for sale to licensed meat exporters, and so ensure that all potential exporters had access to product in a <b>competitive</b> <b>market</b> <b>situation.</b> This would also ensure that prices for meat were set in New Zealand, and that the demand from different markets around the world would be accurately expressed in the average prices achieved on the New Zealand market. In this way the problem of price dominance by the United Kingdom market would be overcome. A satisfactory price setting mechanism for single buyer markets would also be established. The separation of killing and marketing functions would encourage specialisation of operation, and meat would be made available to those companies which have the greatest marketing ability and therefore the ability to obtain and pay the best prices possible. There would be nothing to stop a company which had expertise in both fields from continuing to operate in both killing and marketing. The detailed operation of the carcase market is subject to further investigation, but at this stage it is suggested that it should operate on an electronic auction basis with product being sold daily. Market support judged necessary by the Meat Board could be provided {{at this stage of the}} marketing chain, as could any desired support for farmers provided by the Government. The objective in establishinq such a market would be to ensure that competitive pressures would guarantee the most efficient and profitable operation of the meat industry at all its stages. Returns to farmers and the nation should therefore be maximised...|$|E

50|$|An {{assessment}} of the lost revenues is needed if some power plants, such as wind turbines, have absolute priority (must-run plants). A dispatching authority will in this case order the other plants to decrease power. In some countries plant operators are entitled to receive compensation for such interventions. In a <b>competitive</b> electricity <b>market</b> the <b>situation</b> can be handled by a balancing mechanism, in which any imbalance from the schedule (typically a day-ahead schedule) is penalized, either using the price from a balancing market or a calculated price.
