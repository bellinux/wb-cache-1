25|$|On {{the third}} day {{following}} the accident, a hydrogen bubble was discovered in {{the dome of the}} pressure vessel, and became the focus of concern. A hydrogen explosion might not only breach the pressure vessel, but, depending on its magnitude, might compromise the integrity of the containment vessel leading to large-scale release of radioactive material. However, it was determined that there was no oxygen present in the pressure vessel, a prerequisite for hydrogen to burn or explode. Immediate steps were taken to reduce the hydrogen bubble, and by the following day it was significantly smaller. Over the next week, steam and hydrogen were removed from the reactor using a <b>catalytic</b> <b>recombiner</b> and, controversially, by venting straight to the atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|A {{containment}} {{and waste}} package system for processing and shipping tritium oxide waste received from a process gas includes an outer drum and an inner drum containing a disposable {{molecular sieve bed}} (DMSB) seated within outer drum. The DMSB includes an inlet diffuser assembly, an outlet diffuser assembly, and a hydrogen <b>catalytic</b> <b>recombiner.</b> The DMSB adsorbs tritium oxide from the process gas and converts it to a solid form so that the tritium is contained during shipment to a disposal site. The DMSB is filled with type 4 A molecular sieve pellets capable of adsorbing up to 1000 curies of tritium. The recombiner contains a sufficient amount of catalyst to cause any hydrogen and oxygen present in the process gas to recombine to form water vapor, which is then adsorbed onto the DMSB...|$|E
40|$|A passive autocatalytic {{hydrogen}} recombiner (PAR) is a self-starting device, without operator action or external power input, installed in {{nuclear power plants}} to remove hydrogen from the containment building of a nuclear reactor. A new mechanistic model of PAR has been presented and validated by experimental data and results of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The model allows to quickly and accurately predict gas temperature and composition, catalyst temperature and hydrogen recombination rate. It is assumed in the model that an exothermic recombination reaction of hydrogen and oxygen proceeds at the catalyst surface only, while processes of heat and mass transport occur by assisted natural and forced convection in non-isothermal and laminar gas flow conditions in vertical channels between catalyst plates. The model accounts for heat radiation from a hot catalyst surface and has no adjustable parameters. It can be combined with an equation of chimney draft and become a useful engineering tool for selection and optimisation of <b>catalytic</b> <b>recombiner</b> geometry...|$|E
50|$|In {{a melting}} event, one spot or {{area on the}} RPV will become hotter than other areas, and will {{eventually}} melt. When it melts, corium will pour into the cavity under the reactor. Though the cavity is designed to remain dry, several NUREG-class documents advise operators to flood the cavity {{in the event of}} a fuel melt incident. This water will become steam and pressurize the containment. Automatic water sprays will pump large quantities of water into the steamy environment to keep the pressure down. <b>Catalytic</b> <b>recombiners</b> will rapidly convert the hydrogen and oxygen back into water. One positive effect of the corium falling into water is that it is cooled and returns to a solid state.|$|R

40|$|During {{hypothetical}} core melt accidents {{steam and}} hydrogen can be {{released into the}} air filled containment of pressurized water reactors (PWR). Without counter measures flammable mixtures may form and cause combustion loads that could threaten {{the integrity of the}} containment. German PWRâ€™s are now equipped with passive <b>catalytic</b> <b>recombiners</b> so called PARs (passive autocatalytic recombiners). They are arranged in boxes with arrays of plates coated with a platinum catalyst and are designed to prevent the accumulation of detonable conditions. Recombiner models have been implemented into the CFD code GASFLOW II to simulate such PAR mitigation in thermal hydraulic full containment calculations for various accident scenarios. After a brief description of these models this contribution will give the results from validation calculations of these models with a 3 D experiment for plate recombiners (HDR test E 11. 8. 1) and the thermal hydraulic analysis of larger scale experiments which investigated the performance of such box recombiners with steam/hydrogen release under realistic accident conditions.

40|$|Abstract: The {{simulation}} of a severe accident propagation in containments {{of nuclear power}} plants is required to investigate the consequences of severe accidents {{and the effectiveness of}} potential counter measures under conditions as realistic as possible. For this purpose, GRS developed the Containment Code System (COCOSYS). The main objective is to provide a code system based on mechanistic models for the {{simulation of}} all relevant phenomena, processes and plant states during severe accidents in the containment of LWRs, also covering the aspects of design basis accidents. In this paper the current status of the COCOSYS development will be presented, especially pointing out the new features. Among other things the COCOSYS system has been used in the past for the design and installation of <b>catalytic</b> <b>recombiner</b> systems in German LWR plants. According to the experience gained by validating COCOSYS, for example on HDR Experiment E 11. 4, and the increased requirements to calculate local effects on hydrogen distribution the need for a sophisticated nodalisation of the containment and for the comprehensive simulation of specific system components will be underlined. 1...|$|E
40|$|This section {{describes}} the capabilities to control, collect, process, handle, {{and dispose of}} the gaseous radioactive waste generated {{as a result of}} normal operation and anticipated operational occurrences. The systems addressed in this section are the off-gas system, the turbine gland seal exhaust system, and the mechanical vacuum pump system. The effects of hydrogen addition for hydrogen water chemistry are also addressed in this section. The off-gas system collects, contains, and processes the radioactive gases extracted from the steam condenser. The gases are exhausted by the steam jet air ejectors and flow through a preheater to a <b>catalytic</b> <b>recombiner</b> where all of the hydrogen is recombined with oxygen to form steam. All steam, from recombination booster jets and dilution is condensed for return as condensate and the noncondensible gases flow to a holdup pipe. The gas flow continues through a cooler condenser, a moisture separator, electric reheaters, a prefilter, activated charcoal adsorber vessels, high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, and then to the 310 -foot chimney for discharge to the environment. An alternate off-gas system flow path allows flow to bypass the catalytic recombiners, the activated charcoal adsorber vessels, (bypass lines around 2 A and 3 B recombiners exist but their use is not permitted by TSUP. ...|$|E
40|$|In case of {{a severe}} {{accident}} in light water reactors (LWR) a high amount of hydrogen, up to about 20 000 m(n) (3), might be generated and released into the containment. The mixture, consisting of hydrogen and oxygen, may either burn or detonate, if ignited. In case of detonation the generated shock wave may endanger {{the integrity of the}} containment or safety-related systems. Consequently, an effective removal of hydrogen is required. Hydrogen and oxygen react exothermally at catalytically acting surfaces, already at room temperature, and this is used in <b>catalytic</b> <b>recombiners.</b> It is recommended to combine recombiners with spark or catalytic igniters, in order to cover a broader spectrum of accident sequences. In this contribution, state of the art of hydrogen removal devices are reviewed and the possibilities for innovative methods, making use of the phenomena arising in the containments, using further components will be illustrated accordingly.

50|$|During the 2011 Fukushima nuclear emergency, four reactor {{buildings}} were damaged by hydrogen explosions. Exposed Zircaloy cladded fuel rods became very hot and reacted with steam, releasing hydrogen.

40|$|During {{dissolution}} of nuclear fuel in concentrated nitric acid nitrogen oxides are formed which are {{released into the}} process off-gas system together with the gaseous fission products. The main compoment of the off-gas is air, saturated with water vapor. The main goal of the work reported herein was to remove nitrogen oxides and oxygen from the off-gas by thermal flameless reduction with hydrogen or ammonia. The reactions were performed in a tube reactor made of austenitic stainless steel and in a quartz tube reactor of the same dimensions. The gas reactions were tested at berious gas compositions and temperatures. It was found that at a temperature of 750 Â°C both with hydrogen and ammonia as reducing agent nitrogen oxides and oxygen can be removed below a concentration of 1 ppm. The data show that even the presence of 25 ppm iodine in the gas does not affect these reactions adversely. Based on these laboratory tests a technical concept for a thermal reactor was developed. Besides the experiments with a thermal reactor, tests with a catalytic reactor {{for the removal of}} nitrogen oxides and oxygen with hydrogen were also performed and a critical comparison between thermal and <b>catalytic</b> <b>recombiners</b> was made...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of core melt {{accidents}} in nuclear power plants {{a large amount of}} hydrogen can be produced and form an explosive or even detonative gas mixture with aerial oxygen in the reactor building. In the containment atmosphere of pressurized water reactors hydrogen combines aphlogistically with the oxygen present to form water vapor even at room temperature. In the past, experimental work conducted at various facilities has contributed little or nothing {{to an understanding of the}} operating principles of <b>catalytic</b> <b>recombiners.</b> Hence, the purpose of the present study was to conduct detailed investigations on a section of a recombiner essentially in order to deepen the understanding of reaction kinetics and heat transport processes. The results of the experiments presented in this dissertation form a large data base of measurements which provides an insight into the processes taking place in recombiners. The reaction-kinetic interpretation of the measured data confirms and deepens the diffusion theory - proposed in an earlier study. Thus it is now possible to validate detailed numeric models representing the processes in recombiners. Consequently the present study serves to broaden and corroborate competence in this significant area of reactor technology. In addition, the empirical knowledge thus gained may be used for a critical reassessment of previous numeric model calculations...|$|R
40|$|In all severe {{accidents}} scenarios {{the main}} goal of operator actions (AMM, accident management measure) will be the injection of water into the core region {{as soon as possible}} and as much as possible, in order to reestablish adequate core cooling for termination of the accident. Flooding of the uncovered core is the accident management measure with top priority. The quenching can cause renewed oxidation of the Zircaloy fuel rod cladding, resulting in a temporary temperature increase of the rods before cool-down occurs, a sharp increase in hydrogen production and the release of additional fission products. Especially a very high hydrogen production rate is of concern because any effective hydrogen mitigation system (<b>catalytic</b> <b>recombiners,</b> controlled deflagration) must be able to cope with such rates. A series of separate-effects tests is being carried out on Zircaloy PWR fuel rod cladding to study the enhanced oxidation which can occur on quenching. In these tests single tube specimens are heated by induction to a high temperature and then rapidly cooled down by injection of a cold steam. The principal experimental parameters investigated are the extent of pre-oxidation and the temperature of the tube before cooldown. A total of 24 experiments has been performed with specimens with oxide layer thicknesses varying from 100 #mu#m to 350 #mu#m which were rapidly cooled by steam from 1100 C, 1200 C, 1400 C and 1600 C.

50|$|Another {{scenario}} sees a {{buildup of}} hydrogen, which {{may lead to a}} detonation event, as happened for three reactors during Fukushima incident. <b>Catalytic</b> hydrogen <b>recombiners</b> located within containment are designed to prevent this from occurring; however, in Fukushima recombiners did not work due the absence of power and hydrogen detonation breached the containment. During the 1979 Three Mile Island accident a hydrogen bubble formed in the pressure vessel dome. There were initial concerns that this hydrogen bubble might ignite and damage the pressure vessel or even damage the containment building; but it was soon realized that a lack of oxygen precluded a burnable or explosive mixture from forming inside the pressure vessel.|$|R
40|$|In the PHARE project "Hydrogen Management for the VVER 440 / 213 " (HU 2002 / 000 - 632 - 04 - 01), CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) {{calculations}} using GASFLOW, FLUENT and CFX {{were performed}} for the Paks NPP (Nuclear Power Plant), modelling a defined severe accident scenario which involved {{the release of}} hydrogen. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate that CFD codes {{could be used to}} model gas movement inside a containment during a severe accident. With growing experience in performing such analyses, the results support the use of CFD in assessing the risk of losing containment integrity as a result of hydrogen deflagrations. As an effective mitigation measure in such a situation, the implementation of <b>catalytic</b> <b>recombiners</b> is planned in the Paks NPP. In order to support these plans both unmitigated and recombiner-mitigated simulations were performed. These are described and selected results are compared. The codes CFX and FLUENT needed refinement to their models of wall and bulk steam condensation in order to be fully simulate the severe accident under consideration. Several CFD codes were used in parallel to model the same accident scenario in order to reduce uncertainties in the results. Previously it was considered impractical to use CFD codes to simulate a full containment subject to a severe accident extending over many hours. This was because of the expected prohibitive computing times and missing physical capabilities of the codes. This work demonstrates that, because of developments in the capabilities of CFD codes and improvements in computer power, these calculations have now become feasible. JRC. DG.

25|$|The {{temperature}} of corium {{can be as}} high as 2400Â°C (4,352 Â°F) in the first hours after the meltdown, potentially reaching over 2800Â°C (5,072 Â°F). A large amount of heat can be released by reaction of metals (particularly zirconium) in corium with water. Flooding of the corium mass with water, or the drop of molten corium mass into a water pool, may result in a temperature spike and production of large amounts of hydrogen, which can result in a pressure spike in the containment vessel. The steam explosion resulting from such sudden corium-water contact can disperse the materials and form projectiles that may damage the containment vessel by impact. Subsequent pressure spikes can be caused by combustion of the released hydrogen. Detonation risks can be reduced by the use of <b>catalytic</b> hydrogen <b>recombiners.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} prevent the {{containment}} and other safety relevant components from incurring serious damage caused by a detonation of the hydrogen/air-mixture generated during a severe accident in light water reactors (LWR) passive autocatalytic recombiners (PAR) are used for hydrogen removal in {{an increasing number of}} European plants. These devices make use of the fact that hydrogen and oxygen react exothermally on catalytic surfaces generating steam and heat. Experimental investigations at several research facilities indicate that existing PAR systems bear the risk of igniting the gaseous mixture due to an overheating of the catalyst elements caused by strong reaction heat generation. Innovative devices could overcome existing limitations making use of the knowledge deduced from experiments performed at the REKO facilities at Forschungszentrum Juelich (FZJ).

40|$|MATERIAUX:SURFACES+FMOIn {{the context}} of {{hydrogen}} risk mitigation in nuclear power plants (NPPs), experimental studies of a possible poisoning of Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners (PARS) by fission products (FPs) and aerosols released during a core meltdown accident were mainly conducted in the past with non-radioactive fission product surrogates (e. g., in the H 2 PAR facility at Cadarache, France). The decision was taken in 1997 to complete these studies by a test in the Phebus facility, a research nuclear reactor also at Cadarache: {{it was a rare}} opportunity to expose catalyst samples to an atmosphere as representative as possible of a core meltdown accident, containing gaseous fission products and aerosols released during the degradation of an actual irradiated nuclear fuel bundle. Before testing in Phebus during the FPT 3 experiment, reference and qualification tests were performed in the H 2 PAR facility using the same samples the so-called "coupons" and coupons holder to check that the apparatus was functional and correctly designed for avoiding to tamper with the thermal-hydraulics and chemical conditions in the Phebus containment. The correct operation of catalysts was checked by measuring the surface temperature increase of the coupons due to the exothermic reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. After the Phebus FPT 3 test (November 2004), REKO- 1 tests were initiated at Julich, Germany, to confirm the discrepancy in coupons temperature observed in Phebus FFT 3 and H 2 PAR PHEB- 03 tests, and to study the operation behaviour of PARs. Besides, before REKO- 1 tests, a first interpretation of H 2 PAR and Phebus experiments was led to the conclusion that their difference during the operation was due to the different experimental conditions. Samples of catalysts (IRSN/IRCELYON coupon) similar to those used in Phebus and H 2 PAR facilities were exposed in REKO- 1 facility to an atmosphere {{similar to that of the}} Phebus model containment. During the REKO- 1 experiments, the temperatures of the coupon surface, together with the oxygen and hydrogen recombination kinetics, were measured as a function of the oxygen fraction in the feed. In these conditions, the inlet oxygen fraction was shown to be the main parameter affecting the recombination rate. The presence of steam was also taken into account during the IRSN/IRCELYON coupon operation in REKO- 1. Finally, the PAR surface temperatures during the REKO- 1 tests (both optical and thermocouple measurements) are compared with those obtained during the FPT 3 and PHEB- 03 tests. Then, the experimental observations (from the Phebus FFT 3, H 2 PAR PHEB 03 and REKO- 1 tests) were corroborated by numerical calculations using the SPARK code developed at IRSN for <b>catalytic</b> reactors and <b>recombiners</b> applications. Despite the loss of performance experienced by the coupons in the FPT 3 test, as compared with the PHEB- 03 test, this study does not challenge the qualification of PARs for risk mitigation in Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) NPPs, and suggests that they could still be efficient in the rich burn conditions of partially inerted (oxygen depleted) Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) containments.
