Often, the treatments are factorial in nature and the corresponding <b>crossover</b> <b>designs</b> are relatively large both in periods and subjects. In many practical situations, some higher order interactions can be safely assumed to be zero. Utilizing such interactions, confounded <b>crossover</b> <b>designs</b> for symmetrical factorial experiments with number of levels a prime or a power of a prime are shown in this study, which significantly reduce the number of periods. In addition to having factorial structure, all estimable direct main effects and interactions are estimated with a constant variance, and all estimable residual main effects and interactions are estimated with a constant variance in these designs. Extra period confounded <b>crossover</b> <b>designs</b> are also studied. Although confounded <b>crossover</b> <b>designs</b> require significantly less number of periods, those still require a moderately large number of subjects. Efficient confounded factorial <b>crossover</b> <b>designs</b> with fewer numbers of subjects have been constructed. In analyzing data coming from <b>crossover</b> <b>designs,</b> one often faces issues such as presence of residual effect, within-subject correlation, drop out and informative missing data. A joint model for the observed data and the missing process in a Bayesian setup has been developed. We use Bayesian model comparison methods to compare and evaluate missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and informative drop out (ID) models.

40|$|<b>Crossover</b> <b>designs</b> {{are widely}} used in {{clinical}} trials. The main advantage {{of this type of}} design is that the treatments are compared within subjects.

50|$|They are {{commonly}} used in speaker <b>crossover</b> <b>design</b> (due to the moderately large voltages and currents, {{and the lack of}} easy access to a power supply), filters in power distribution networks (due to the large voltages and currents), power supply bypassing (due to low cost, and in some cases, power requirements), as well as a variety of discrete and home brew circuits (for low-cost and simplicity). Passive filters are uncommon in monolithic integrated circuit design, where active devices are inexpensive compared to resistors and capacitors, and inductors are prohibitively expensive. Passive filters are still found, however, in hybrid integrated circuits. Indeed, it may be the desire to incorporate a passive filter that leads the designer to use the hybrid format.|$|E

Their behavior changes with the signal level dependent dynamics of the drivers. They block the power amplifier from taking maximum control over the voice coil motion. They are a waste of time, if accuracy of reproduction is the goal." [...] Alternatively, passive components can be utilised to construct filter circuits before the amplifier.

Its founder was Brent Bolleman and its first raison d'être was to refine and market an {{electrostatic}} computer product based on the design of Quad Electrostatics. Electrostatic speakers have their own problems due to the need for the membrane requiring high voltage, which is dangerous and has the requirement of a step up transformer, which is costly. The ultimate desire was to have a speaker that looked great and sounded great, so the conversion to planar magnetic design, which had problems of its own but easier dealt with, most notably was the need for rare earth magnets, which were expensive. Much of the focus of the transition focused on how to reduce this cost element and make the speakers more appealing to a larger pool of consumers. The early unnamed company started sending out prototypes to United Technologies. Through this the company made contacts with Woody Jackson a high end audio products expert based in Little Rock Arkansas, and Dave Clark an audio engineer who had ties to Delphi based in Detroit.

The procedures carried out as part of MTN-017 determined how much of each drug is absorbed in blood, rectal fluid, and tissue, and also assessed any changes in cells or tissue. Study participants were asked about any side effects, what they liked and disliked about using the gel either daily or with sex, and whether they would consider using the gel in the future.

50|$|The DASH-Sodium {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{following the end of}} the original DASH study to determine whether the DASH diet could produce even better results if it were low in salt and also {{to examine the effects of}} different levels of sodium in people eating the DASH diet. The researchers were interested in determining the effects of sodium reduction when combined with the DASH diet as well as the effects of the DASH diet when at three levels of sodium intake. The DASH-Sodium trial was conducted from September 1997 through November 1999. Like the previous study, it was based on a large sample (412 participants) and was a multi-center, randomized, outpatient feeding study where the subjects were given all their food. The participants were adults with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension (average systolic of 120 to 159 mm Hg & average diastolic of 80 to 95 mm Hg) and were randomly assigned to one of two diet groups. The two randomized diet groups were the DASH diet and a control diet that mirrored a “typical American diet”, and which was somewhat low in key nutrients such as potassium, magnesium and calcium. The DASH diet was the same as in the previous DASH study. After being assigned to one of these two diets, the participants were given diets that differed by 3 distinct levels of sodium content, corresponding to 3,000 mg, 2,400 mg or 1,500 mg/day (higher, intermediate or lower), in random order, for 30 consecutive days each. During the two-week run-in phase, all participants ate the high sodium control diet. The 30-day intervention phase followed, in which subjects ate their assigned diets at each of the aforementioned sodium levels (high, intermediate and low) in random order, in a <b>crossover</b> <b>design.</b> During the 30-day dietary intervention phase, each participant therefore consumed his or her assigned diet (either DASH or control) at all three sodium levels.|$|E
