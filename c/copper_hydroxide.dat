40|$|This {{research}} was to apply {{the combination of the}} particle swarm optimization method and artificial neural network training with the aim of building a quantitative model to forecast the size of copper nanoparticles (Cu-NPs) prepared in sodium alginate.

50|$|Within the {{weathering}} environment chemical oxidation of {{a variety}} of metals occurs. The most commonly observed is the oxidation of Fe2+ (iron) and combination with oxygen and water to form Fe3+ hydroxides and oxides such as goethite, limonite, and hematite. This gives the affected rocks a reddish-brown coloration on the surface which crumbles easily and weakens the rock. This process is better known as 'rusting', though it is distinct from the rusting of metallic iron. Many other metallic ores and minerals oxidize and hydrate to produce colored deposits, such as chalcopyrites or CuFeS2 oxidizing to <b>copper</b> <b>hydroxide</b> and iron oxides.|$|E
