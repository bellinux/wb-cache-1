5|$|One of Ipswich Town's nicknames is The Blues, {{stemming}} from their traditional kit, which is predominantly blue. Since turning professional, Ipswich {{have used a}} number of away colours, including white, orange, red and black vertical stripes, <b>claret</b> and green, cream and black vertical stripes and dark blue and <b>claret.</b>|$|E
5|$|Burnley did {{not play}} any {{pre-season}} friendly games other than a practice match between the first team and the reserves, which was watched by a crowd of around 10,000 at Turf Moor. The team's last competitive match had ended in a 0–2 defeat against Manchester United in the Lancashire Senior Cup on 8May 1920, almost four months earlier. The strip for 1920–21 was very little changed {{from that of the}} previous season; the <b>claret</b> jersey with light blue sleeves and a light blue stripe around the collar was kept along with the white shorts, but the <b>claret</b> socks were replaced by black.|$|E
5|$|Thames Ironworks, {{and later}} West Ham United, {{retained}} the <b>claret</b> yoke/blue sleeves design, but also {{continued to use}} their previously favoured colours for their away kits.|$|E

5|$|During the Indonesia–Malaysia {{confrontation}} in Borneo, Large {{took part in}} Operation <b>Claret.</b> As {{the leader of a}} four-man SAS patrol, he spent up to two weeks at a time hidden in the jungle on deniable incursions into Indonesia, performing reconnaissance or ambushing Indonesian forces.|$|E
5|$|Kit changes {{had been}} {{introduced}} in the late 1930s. The 1937 season saw Palace field a shirt of <b>claret</b> and blue stripes, before adopting white shirts and black shorts for the following eleven seasons. The club reverted to <b>claret</b> and blue in 1948, but any attempt at changing the kit to change their luck backfired as the club had their worst season to date, finishing bottom and celebrating twenty-five years in League Football by applying for re-election for the first time. Palace kept their place, changed the kit back to white shirts and black shorts, and finished seventh the following season. They followed this up with another bottom place and re-election in 1951, with the unwanted record of scoring the lowest number of goals in a Division Three South season. Palace would remain in {{the bottom half of}} the table until the League was restructured in 1958, requiring re-election a third and final time in 1956, with only Swindon keeping them from bottom spot that season.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Operation <b>Claret</b> {{was largely}} {{successful}} in gaining the initiative, inflicting significant casualties on the Indonesians {{and keeping them}} on the defensive, before being suspended late in the war. Generally British Commonwealth units on their first tour in Borneo {{were not allowed to}} undertake such audacious operations however, and consequently, although highly successful the actions of 3 RAR in their first and only tour may not have been representative of those by more experienced Gurkha and British battalions. Denied during the war, these incursions were only publicly disclosed by Britain in 1974, while the Australian government did not officially acknowledge its involvement until 1996. 3 RAR carried out 32 <b>Claret</b> operations in total, including 12 reconnaissance patrols and 20 ambushes or fighting patrols, although the majority never resulted in contact. In contrast, Indonesian activity was usually small-scale and aimed to challenge incursions rather than to attack them.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} colours of {{the team}} were dark blue, due to Thames Ironworks chairman Arnold Hills being {{a former student of}} Oxford University. However, the team used a variety of kits including the <b>claret</b> and sky blue house colours of Thames Ironworks, as well as sky blue or white kit.|$|E
5|$|These {{issues were}} would shape {{what would be}} known as Operation <b>Claret.</b> The best-trained British light {{infantry}} roamed the jungle, attacking Indonesian bases and patrols at will and trying to {{give the appearance of}} being everywhere at once as a psychological effect upon the enemy. Initially launched only over short distances, seaborne raids into peninsular Malaysia caused the range to be extended throughout 1964 and 1965. Walker continued the <b>Claret</b> raids to great effect until the end of his tenure, as he was replaced by Major General George Lea as commander of British forces in Borneo. Lea, however, had the bad fortune of being ordered to take command just as the conflict began to reach its climax in the spring of 1965. Sukarno, desperate for a decisive victory and apprehensive of the effect that the fruitless conflict was having upon his country, was beginning to order stronger attacks to win a decisive military victory and drive the British from the border lines.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{television}} programmes have included references to Aston Villa {{over the past}} few decades. In the sitcom Porridge, the character Lennie Godber is a Villa supporter. When filming began on Dad's Army, Villa fan Ian Lavender was allowed to choose Frank Pike's scarf from an array in the BBC wardrobe; he chose a <b>claret</b> and blue one—Aston Villa's colours. The character Nessa in the BBC sitcom Gavin & Stacey was revealed as an Aston Villa fan in an episode screened in December 2009.|$|E
5|$|The Irons {{permanently}} adopted <b>claret</b> {{and blue}} for home colours {{in the summer}} of 1899. Thames Ironworks right-half Charlie Dove received the Aston Villa kit from his father William Dove, who was a professional sprinter of national repute, as well as being involved with the coaching at Thames Ironworks. Bill Dove had been at a fair in Birmingham, close to Villa Park, the home ground of Aston Villa and was challenged to a race against four Villa players, who wagered money that one of them would win.|$|E

5|$|The SASR {{first saw}} action in 1965 {{as part of}} the British Commonwealth force {{stationed}} in north Borneo during the Indonesian Confrontation. The SASR troopers operated alongside their British and New Zealand counterparts in operations aimed at stopping Indonesian infiltration into Malaysia, taking part in Operation <b>Claret.</b> 1 Squadron conducted reconnaissance patrols in Sarawak from February to July 1965, and cross-border operations between May and July. They suffered their first fatality on 2 June when a soldier was gored by an elephant. 1 Squadron completed operations on 1 August and returned to Australia. 2 Squadron arrived in Borneo in January 1966 for a four-month deployment, and despite the suspension of <b>Claret</b> operations it also conducted reconnaissance patrols and cross-border operations, undertaking a total of 45 patrols {{on both sides of the}} border. On 19 March two soldiers drowned during a river crossing. On 21 July, 2 Squadron was relieved by a British SAS squadron and returned to Australia in August. Despite often being deployed in the reconnaissance role, the SASR killed at least 20 Indonesian soldiers in a series of ambushes and contacts. Three SASR soldiers were killed. These operations mostly occurred in secret, and were never admitted during the war.|$|E
5|$|Bradford City {{became the}} first league {{football}} team from the county, before they even had a team or played a game. They and Chelsea, who were elected to the league two years later, share {{the distinction of being}} the only clubs to join the league without having played a competitive fixture. A summer archery contest, which had been organised {{to raise money for the}} rugby league club, was used to finance the new club, and Manningham's colours of <b>claret</b> and amber were adopted as Bradford City's kit, but with Manningham's hoops changed to stripes.|$|E
5|$|Cooking in {{southern}} England was noted for {{a tendency toward}} frying, simmering, and roasting, and this also became true for Virginian cooking. Wealthy households tended to vary cooking methods greatly, while poor households were generally confined to boiling and frying. The only form of cooking that was slow to develop was baking. Typical dishes among the upper classes were fricassees of various meats with herbs, and sometimes {{a good amount of}} <b>claret.</b> Common food among the lower classes was corn porridge or mush, hominy with greens and salt-cured meat, and later the traditional southern fried chicken and chitlins.|$|E

5|$|Crystal Palace Football Club {{was formed}} on 10 September 1905 {{playing in the}} Aston Villa colours of <b>claret</b> and blue. The choice of colours {{was a result of}} the {{important}} role in the club's formation played by Edmund Goodman, an Aston Villa employee who was recommended to the fledgling club by the Villa chairman, William McGregor. Goodman organised the business side of the club and managed the team from 1907 to 1925. A former amateur player with Villa, Goodman had lost his right leg after an injury led to amputation. Goodman hired John Robson from Middlesbrough to be the team's manager. Robson had transformed his previous club from an amateur side to an established Football League First Division side.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} phases, British and Malaysian troops had {{attempted}} only {{to control the}} border, and to protect population centres. However, {{by the time the}} Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action, crossing borders to obtain information and forcing the Indonesians to remain on the defensive, under the codename Operation <b>Claret.</b> The fighting took place in mountainous, jungle-clad terrain, and a debilitating climate, with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border, cross-border operations, the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply, and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine Indonesian movements and intentions.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in the Walker Whiskey Trophy events, a number of Rush's admirers and backers held a banquet in his honour, at which they {{presented}} him with an illuminated testimonial along with a sterling silver tea set, salver, and <b>claret</b> jug, valued at £200. These recognised his excellence as a sportsman, and his admirable qualities as a man. The salver was inscribed with a dedication, and each piece bore an inscribed caricature of Rush at the oars of an outrigger skiff. The silver items {{are now in the}} collection of the Clarence River Historical Society in Grafton, New South Wales.|$|E
