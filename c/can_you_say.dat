It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

500|$|... "Electioneering", {{featuring}} a cowbell and a distorted guitar solo, is the album's most rock-oriented track {{and one of}} the heaviest songs Radiohead has recorded. It has been compared to Radiohead's earlier style on Pablo Honey. The cynical [...] "Electioneering" [...] is the album's most directly political song, with lyrics inspired by the Poll Tax Riots. The song was also inspired by Chomsky's , a book analysing contemporary mass media under the propaganda model. Yorke likened its lyrics, which focus on political and artistic compromise, to [...] "a preacher ranting in front of a bank of microphones." [...] Regarding its oblique political references, Yorke said, [...] "What <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> about the IMF, or politicians? Or people selling arms to African countries, employing slave labour or whatever. What <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>say?</b> You just write down 'Cattle prods and the IMF' and people who know, know."

However, the order eventually failed through a lack of suitable applicants.|$|E

[...] Supposedly the archbishop fumbled with the Crown but Lang himself was fully satisfied: [...] "I can only be thankful to God's over-ruling Providence and trust that the Coronation may not be a mere dream of the past, but that its memories and lessons will not be forgotten."
