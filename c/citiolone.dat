50|$|The {{most common}} thiolactone, {{homocysteine}} thiolactone is produced biochemically from homocysteine {{and it may}} play a role in protein damage. The thiolactone functional group is also present in some pharmaceutical drugs such as <b>citiolone</b> and erdosteine. Thiolactone rings can also be found in peptides synthesized by bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus in order to regulate their quorum-sensing system.|$|E
40|$|Islet cells cocultured with {{activated}} macrophages are lysed within 15 h in vitro. We showed previously that {{nitric oxide}} generated by macrophages {{is a major}} mediator of islet cell death. We have now probed several pathways {{to interfere with the}} chain of events leading to islet cell death. Scavenging of extracellular oxygen radicals by superoxide dismutase and catalase did not improve islet cell survival. Scavenging of extra- and intracellular oxygen radicals by two potent substances, <b>citiolone</b> and dimethyl-thiourea, also did not reduce islet cell lysis, while a lipid-soluble scavenger, probucol, provided partial protection. These findings argue against a synergistic action of nitric oxide and oxygen radicals in islet cell toxicity. The inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by 3 -aminobenzamide significantly improved islet cell survival. Selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase, such as indomethacin or acetylsalicylic acid, did not improve islet cell survival. Full protection was seen in the presence of NDGA, an inhibitor of lipoxygenase, and partial suppression was caused by BW 755 c, an inhibitor of both lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase. We conclude that inflammatory islet cell death caused by activated macrophages involves the activation of arachidonic acid metabolism and of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, but that scavenging of oxygen free radicals provides little protection from lysis...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} oxidative stress on expression of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD), CuZn-SOD and Mn-SOD, two fibroblast lines were exposed for periods of up to 4 days to a wide concentration range of oxidizing agents: xanthine oxidase plus hypoxanthine, paraquat, pyrogallol, alpha-naphthoflavone, hydroquinone, catechol, Fe 2 + ions, Cu 2 + ions, buthionine sulphoximine, diethylmaleate, t-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, selenite, <b>citiolone</b> and high oxygen partial pressure. The cell lines were cultured both under serum starvation and at a serum concentration that permitted growth. Under no condition was there any evidence of EC-SOD induction. Instead, the agents uniformly, dose-dependently and continuously reduced EC-SOD expression. We interpret the effect to be due to toxicity. Enhancement of the protection against oxidative stress by addition of CuZn-SOD, catalase and low concentrations of selenite did not influence the expression of any of the SOD isoenzymes. Removal of EC-SOD from cell surfaces by heparin also did not influence SOD expression. Mn-SOD was moderately induced by high doses of the first 11 oxidants. Apart from reduction at high toxic doses, there were no significant effects on the CuZn-SOD activity by any of the treatments. Thus EC-SOD, previously shown to be profoundly influenced by inflammatory cytokines, was not induced by its substrate or other oxidants. In a similar fashion, Mn-SOD, previously shown to be greatly induced and depressed by cytokines, was only moderately influenced by oxidants. We suggest that the regulation of these SOD isoenzymes in mammalian tissues primarily occurs in a manner co-ordinated by cytokines, rather than as a response of individual cells to oxidants...|$|E
