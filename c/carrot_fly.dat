5000|$|The flies {{lay their}} eggs around the {{developing}} carrots; the larvae, once hatched, burrow into the root. As female carrot flies are very low flying, the best method of prevention is to erect a barrier around the crop at least 60 cm high. Alternatively horticultural fleece {{may be used as}} a floating mulch to cover the crop. Because the <b>carrot</b> <b>fly</b> is attracted to host plants by odor, masking the smell of the host plant by planting odoriferous companion crops such as onions, chives, and garlic can successfully deter attack. Intermixing of crops can also be a fruitful way to confuse and avoid <b>carrot</b> <b>fly</b> attack. Some plants such as Rosemary, Sage, and Marigold are also used to deter the <b>carrot</b> <b>fly.</b> Newer varieties of carrot which claim to be resistant to <b>carrot</b> <b>fly</b> (e.g. [...] "Flyaway") may be used.Another method of control is to use heavier, fine plastic mesh available from garden centers and over the internet made specially for the purpose.

[Diptera: Psilidae]) attack was examined via an ovipositional preference study in the laboratory and a damage assessment in the field. Laboratory studies were conducted to determine if P. rosae had a propensity to oviposit on a specific cultivar. Cultivar pairs were exposed to adult P. rosae for seven days to two weeks in controlled temperature chambers and were examined {{for the number of}} eggs deposited by P. rosae through floatation and filtration of the samples. There was a significant difference (P = 0. 0015) between the number of eggs found on cv. Danvers Half Long 126 and on cv. Flyaway. There were no significant deviations from the expected 50 : 50 ratio in the tests comparing oviposition on Danvers and Nantes, Danvers and Chantenay, Nantes and Chantenay, and Nantes and Flyaway. [...] The resistance of the same four carrot cultivars to <b>carrot</b> rust <b>fly</b> attack was investigated in field studies at two sites in 1995 and 1996. Four carrot cultivars were planted in mid-June at two sites (Memorial University of Newfoundland Botanical Garden (BG) and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Research Centre, St. John's (RC)), in a randomized block design, and assessed for the damage caused by P. rosae larvae. At the BG site in 1995, significant damage was found on cv. Danvers Half Long 126 (1. 2 %), Nantes Half Long received 1. 1 % damage, Chantenay had 0. 9 % damage and Flyaway received 0. 3 % damage. No significant damage was found at this site in 1996 or at the RC site in 1995 or 1996. [...] Adult <b>carrot</b> rust <b>flies</b> were monitored with marigold-yellow sticky traps at home gardens and commercial sites in the St. John's area from mid-June to November in 1995 and 1996. One distinct period of adult activity was observed in 1995 whereas two distinct periods were observed in 1996. This reflects the occurrence of one generation per year typically and the possibility of another generation depending upon the season. Two-year means for cumulative air degree-days (DD) above 3 °C after 1 April for first, 10 %, maximum, and 90 % trap catch of the overwintering generation were 308, 418, 590, and 752 DD, respectively. [...] Adult <b>carrot</b> rust <b>flies</b> were trapped in carrot production areas in the regions surrounding Conception Bay, Placentia Bay, Bonavista Bay, Notre Dame Bay, and Bonne Bay. However, even though traps were placed in field in the area around St. George's Bay and in Labrador, no flies were trapped. [...] Damage caused by the larvae of the <b>carrot</b> rust <b>fly</b> was reduced in areas exposed to wind compared to more sheltered areas thus it is possible that <b>carrot</b> rust <b>fly</b> damage can be reduced by planting the carrot crop in exposed areas of the garden or field where the adult will have difficulty flying. [...] The study of the seasonal history and distribution of the <b>carrot</b> rust <b>fly</b> in Newfoundland provides valuable information to producers because it has alerted producers to a potential pest in their production area.

Adaptation of the existing <b>carrot</b> <b>fly</b> forecast to quantify how the date of crop drilling influences subsequent fly pressure. The <b>carrot</b> <b>fly</b> forecast produced at HRI Wellesbourne will be used to predict the proportion of the first generation of flies that will lay eggs on carrot crops drilled on different dates. The model will also be used to predict the timing of emergence of the subsequent fly generation within the crop. It will then be verified using data from experimental carrot plots located close to the source of the main <b>carrot</b> <b>fly</b> population at HRI; these data will be incorporated into the existing <b>carrot</b> <b>fly</b> forecast model; 2. Production of a model to quantify how crop damage can be reduced by altering the harvest date. A sub-model based on published and field data will be incorporated into the <b>carrot</b> <b>fly</b> forecast model, together with meteorological data; this model will be calibrated with experimental data collected from carrot plots at Wellesbourne; 3. Identification of times at which crops should be covered to reduce <b>carrot</b> <b>fly</b> damage. Output from the <b>carrot</b> <b>fly</b> model will be modified to identify the times at which crops should be covered and the dates after which it is safe to uncover crops for operations such as weeding; 4. Quantification of the contribution possible from host plants with various levels of resistance. Data collected at HRI Wellesbourne will be used in simple mathematical models to quantify how partial plant resistance can contribute to the reduction of <b>carrot</b> <b>fly</b> damage alone or in combination with other damage reduction techniques; 5. Verification of <b>carrot</b> <b>fly</b> control strategies. Information collected in objectives 1 - 4 will be used to produce a strategy for reducing <b>carrot</b> <b>fly</b> damage in organically grown umbelliferous crops; this will be evaluated by HDRA in commercial carrot and parsnip crops where there are high and low levels of infestation. Objectives 6 - 11 will focus on pests of cruciferous crops; 6. Adaptation of the existing pest forecasts to quantify how the judicious choice of planting and harvesting dates can be used to reduce crop damage. Existing forecasting systems for pollen beetle, cabbage root fly, cabbage aphid, diamond-back moth, small white butterfly, cabbage moth and garden pebble moth will be used to identify the periods when cruciferous crops are at risk from each of these pest species. Forecasts will be verified by experimental data obtained from cabbage plots; 7. Identification of crop/pest situations where application of crop covers would be advantageous. A literature review will be conducted to identify crop/pest combinations where it would be advantageous to apply covers to exclude insect pests; results from relevant field experiments will also be included; 8. Evaluation of simple methods for inspecting crops to determine {{the presence or absence of}} any given pest species. A literature review will be conducted, including results from studies involving sampling aphid and caterpillar pests within cruciferous crops; 9. Identification of critical periods during which control measures should be applied. The literature will be reviewed to indicate the best time to apply the various control measures available to organic growers. Output from models of pest activity will be modified to indicate the most appropriate timings for application of each control measure; 10. Verification of the pest control strategy arising from work conducted in objectives 7 - 10. This strategy will be underpinned by the pest forecast models and will be presented as a MORPH decision support system. The strategy will be evaluated in an organic cropping system by growing crops of cauliflower and cabbage in locations with different levels of pest infestation; and 11.

40|$|The {{effect of}} organic versus {{conventional}} growing practise on yield, quality, pests and diseases of three vegetable crops were examined. Cultivars of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. convar. Botrytis), bulb onions (Allium cepa L.) and carrots (Daucus carota) were grown organically and conventionally {{during the years}} 2000 - 2003. Differences in cultivar yield, quality and resistance towards pests were determined. However, none of the cultivars were observed to be superior in the conventional compared to the organic growing system. Yields of conventional cauliflower and onions were higher than when grown organically, whereas no differences in carrot yields were observed between the two systems. A larger percentage of the harvested conventional onions were discarded, reducing the difference in net yield between the two systems. Generally, the reasons for discarding varied between the two systems. In organic cauliflower damage by slugs and loose curds were {{the main reasons for}} discarding. Loose curds can be explained by nitrogen deficiency while the damage by slugs is ascribed to the warm and humid environment created under insect nets used in the organic growing system. In both systems, the most severe reason for discarding of onions was exterior watery scales. Rot and mold were more pronounced in the conventional system whereas thick-necked onions were more frequent in the organic system due to larger distance between the onions. Conventional carrots were significantly more damaged by <b>carrot</b> <b>flies</b> than organic <b>carrots</b> even though the flies were present in the organic system and pesticides were applied in the conventional system. In contrast, more deform carrots were seen in the organic system. Generally, less organically crops were discarded due to pests, which presumably {{can be explained by the}} resistance of organic crops towards pests due to the increased diversity of microbial biomass and presence of insect natural enemies. On the contrary, the lower yields in organically grown vegetables can mainly be explained by morphological defects probably created by changes in growing system design in order to facilitate weed management. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>carrot</b> <b>fly</b> Psila rosae {{is a major}} pest {{in organic}} carrots. Damage {{strongly}} depends on local factors and is often found when cropping intensity is high. However, limited field site availability may require growing carrots close to crop sites of preceding years. Here, results {{of the first two}} years show carrots may be protected from infestation using trap crops (also carrots) to bind and actively reduce the local P. rosae population. To protect the main carrot field, pair wise arrangements of carrot strips were sown 1) directly at the previous year carrot field and 2) close to the main field to protect the present carrots. During the first generation a mean sum of 36 and 62 flies/ trap in 2007 and 2008 respectively were monitored with yellow sticky traps (Rebell orange®) leading to high infestation pressure. Monitoring results show the flies are effectively attracted and bound by strip 1) but still negotiate distances of 130 and 180 metres between previous and present carrot fields. Carrot strip 1) was to be removed in time to prevent the second generation of P. rosae to develop. Based on the simulation model SWAT monitoring data and damage assessment was used for timing concerns. Hence, critical issues about removing the trap crops are discussed.

In 2008 we found an indication that strong smelling oil can reduce onion root fly damage. In the untreated plot 7 % of the roots were affected by the carrot root fly and in the treated plot (masked by strong smelling oil) 1 % of the roots were affected. In 2009 on 6 carrot fields and one root parsley field demonstrations were created by Dutch organic farmers to reduce <b>carrot</b> <b>fly</b> damage. In all the 6 carrot fields the root fly damage was too little to determine differences. The maximum percentage of infected carrot roots was below 3 %.

In the patch protected by onion oil 1. 5 % of the roots were affected. At a distance of 150 m from this patch no infected roods were found. At a distance of 270 m from the patch 11. 5 % of the roots were affected. The oils used have a natural origin (extracted from plants). The method is selective because only insects reacting on the carrot smell are affected. They have more difficulty in finding carrot fields, or can not find them at all.

'Kolombina' and pot marigold (Calendula officinalis L.) 'Promyk' on carrot yield, its quality, and the occurrence of pests. On average in both years of the study, intercropping did not reduce total or marketable carrot yield. In 2003 intercropping contributed to a significant increase in marketable yield compared with yield from sole cropping. In 2004 the dry matter content was higher in the roots of carrots grown with pot marigold. The treatments intercropped with both French and pot marigold were characterized by an increased content of sugars in carrot roots and in 2004 year – of carotenoids. Intercropping had a significant effect on the number of roots damaged by the <b>carrot</b> rust <b>fly,</b> Psila rosae, (the best in this respect was the combination with Tagetes) and by nematodes (the best in this respect was the combination with Calendula). The number of larvae of carrot psyllid, Trioza viridula, was significantly lower in the plots where carrot was intercropped. The study did not find intercropping to {{have a positive effect on}} reducing the occurrence of the root aphid...|$|R

40|$|The <b>carrot</b> <b>fly</b> (Psila rosae F.) is an {{important}} pest of the cultivated carrot (Daucus carota) and other crop species in the family Apiaceae, since the larvae burrow into and feed on the developing roots. Current P. rosae control relies heavily upon the use of chemical insecticides, but these are inadequate. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the chemical ecology of P. rosae, particularly with regard to long range attractant and repellent semiochemicals suitable for incorporation into integrated pest management strategies; the incorporation of attractant host plant extracts, or semiochemical attractants, into the monitoring programme; and the development of an autodissemination trap for release of the pathogenic fungus Entomophthora schizophorae in the field for biological control. A number of techniques for the extraction of volatile semiochemicals {{from a wide range of}} host and non-host plant species, and P. rosae adults themselves, were employed and compared. Samples were analysed by gas chromatography (GC), and the biologically active components in these complex natural product extracts were located by coupled GC-electrophysiological techniques and identified by coupled GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Responses to the electrophysiologically active compounds were compared using electroantennographic (EAG) analysis: one unusually high EAG response was observed to a toxic component in hemlock (Conium maculatum) leaf extract (y-coniceine). Of the forty-two EAG active components identified from common crop species and C. maculatum, eight had not previously been reported. A range of bioassay techniques (including four-arm star olfactometers, V-tube olfactometers, and oviposition bioassays) were employed to determine behavioural activity of the samples and identified compounds, but only the oviposition bioassay showed significant behavioural discrimination to y-coniceine. Further studies of longer range behavioural responses to volatile semiochemicals were performed in the field. Significant responses were seen to a known field attractant (combined trans-asarone and hexanal) and, for the first time, to a microwave assisted solvent extract of celery (Apium graveolens) leaf. A prototype autodissemination trap for E. schizophorae was produced and evaluated...|$|E
