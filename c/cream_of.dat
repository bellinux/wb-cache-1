5|$|Boddingtons Brewery was a {{regional}} brewery in Manchester, England, which owned pubs throughout the North West. Boddingtons {{was best known}} for Boddingtons Bitter (Boddies), a straw-golden, hoppy bitter {{which was one of}} the first beers to be packaged in cans containing a widget, giving it a creamy draught-style head. In the 1990s, the beer was promoted as The <b>Cream</b> <b>of</b> Manchester in a popular advertising campaign credited with raising Manchester's profile. Boddingtons became one of the city's most famous products after Manchester United and Coronation Street.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe slurry of mPCM {{has been}} widely used for {{enhancing}} heat transfer and reducing building energy consumption. Because of intrinsic density differences between mPCM and water, the slurry is subject to creaming phenomena. As a consequence the viscosity of slurry increases and the thermal properties decrease. Up to now no quantitative analysis about the <b>creaming</b> <b>of</b> mPCM has been done. In the paper experimental measurement and numerical modeling <b>of</b> the <b>creaming</b> <b>of</b> mPCM slurry is presented. Using the optical method, the temporal-spatial distribution of volume concentration is recorded. Based on the conservation model, the process <b>of</b> <b>creaming</b> has been simulated...|$|R
