50|$|A {{chalk line}} or <b>chalk</b> <b>box</b> {{is a tool}} for marking long, {{straight}} lines on relatively flat surfaces, much farther than is practical by hand or with a straightedge. They {{may be used to}} lay out straight lines between two points, or vertical lines by using the weight of the line reel as a plumb line.|$|E
5000|$|The James Ossuary is a 1st-century <b>chalk</b> <b>box</b> {{that was}} used for {{containing}} {{the bones of the}} dead. The Aramaic inscription: Ya'akov bar-Yosef akhui diYeshua (English translation: [...] "James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus") is cut into one side of the box. The inscription is considered significant because, if genuine, it might provide archaeological evidence for Jesus of Nazareth. However, the authenticity of the inscription has been challenged.|$|E
50|$|A {{chalk line}} or <b>chalk</b> <b>box</b> {{is a tool}} for marking long, {{straight}} lines on relatively flat surfaces, much farther than is practical by hand or with a straightedge. It is an important tool in construction and carpentry, the working of timber in a rough and unplaned state, as {{it does not require}} the timber to have a straight or squared edge formed onto it beforehand. A chalk line draws straight lines by the action of a taut nylon or similar string that has been previously coated with a loose dye, usually chalk. The string is then laid across the surface to be marked and pulled tight. Next, the string is then plucked or snapped sharply, causing the string to strike the surface, which then transfers its chalk to the surface along that straight line where it struck.|$|E

50|$|In {{baseball}} {{the physical}} infield is {{where most of}} the action in a baseball game occurs, as it includes that area where the all-important duel between the pitcher and batter takes place. The pitcher stands on the pitcher's mound (a raised mound of dirt located {{at the center of the}} infield) and from there he pitches the ball to his catcher, who is crouched behind home plate sixty feet, six inches away at what might be called the cutlet of the diamond-shaped baseball field. To the left and right of the catcher are <b>chalk</b> <b>boxes</b> in the dirt called batter's boxes. The opposing team's batter must stand in one of the two boxes and from there he will attempt to hit the pitched ball with his bat. The umpire, who officiates the game, stands behind the catcher. The other important parts of the infield are the three bases, first base (to the pitcher's left, looking toward home plate), second base (behind the pitcher) and third base (to the pitcher's right). Together, home plate and the three bases form a diamond around the pitcher, with each side of the diamond measuring 90 feet.|$|R
5000|$|In pre-tip days, it {{was common}} for players to twist the ends of their cue into a plaster wall or ceiling so that a chalk-like deposit would form on the end, {{reducing}} {{the chance of a}} miscue. The first systematic marketing of chalk was by John Carr, a marker in John Bartley's billiard rooms in Bath. Between Carr and Bartley, it was discovered how [...] "" [...] (...) could be used to the advantage of players, and Carr began selling <b>chalk</b> in small <b>boxes.</b> He called it [...] "twisting powder", and the magical impression this gave the public enabled him to sell it for a higher price than if they realized it was simply chalk in a small box. [...] "", an American term for sidespin, derives from the British discovery of sidespin's effects, as [...] "mass√©" [...] comes from the French word for [...] "mace".|$|R
