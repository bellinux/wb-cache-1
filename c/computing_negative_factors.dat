40|$|The {{problem of}} finding matches {{of a regular}} {{expression}} (RE) on a string exists in many applications such as text editing, biosequence search, and shell commands. Existing techniques first identify candidates using substrings in the RE, then verify each of them using an automaton. These techniques become inefficient when there are many candidate occurrences {{that need to be}} verified. In this paper we propose a novel technique that prunes false negatives by utilizing <b>negative</b> <b>factors,</b> which are substrings that cannot appear in an answer. A main advantage of the technique is that it can be integrated with many existing algorithms to improve their efficiency significantly. We give a full specification of this technique. We develop an efficient algorithm that utilizes <b>negative</b> <b>factors</b> to prune candidates, then improve it by using bit operations to process <b>negative</b> <b>factors</b> in parallel. We show that <b>negative</b> <b>factors,</b> when used together with necessary factors (substrings that must appear in each answer), can achieve much better pruning power. We analyze the large number of <b>negative</b> <b>factors,</b> and develop an algorithm for finding a small number of high-quality <b>negative</b> <b>factors.</b> We conducted a thorough experimental study of this technique on real data sets, including DNA sequences, proteins, and text documents, and show the significant performance improvement when applying the technique in existing algorithms. For instance, it improved the search speed of the popular Gnu Grep tool by 11 to 74 times for text documents...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an evaluation model useful {{for assessing the}} suitability of public-private partnership (PPP) projects by studying their attractive and <b>negative</b> <b>factors.</b> A survey of industrial practitioners in Hong Kong was conducted. Respondents were asked to rank the importance of 15 attractive and 13 <b>negative</b> <b>factors</b> for adopting PPP. From the rankings, relative weights of each factor were derived. The weights of these factors {{formed the basis for}} the evaluation model presented in this paper. The Hong Kong Zhuhai Macau Bridge was used to demonstrate how this evaluation model could be applied. From the list of attractive and <b>negative</b> <b>factors</b> the writers selected those that were foreseeable in this project. Calculating the total weights of each group of <b>factors</b> showed that <b>negative</b> <b>factors</b> outweighed attractive factors by 27 %. The result indicated that PPP would not be a suitable method for delivering this project. The evaluation model presented in this paper can help both {{the public and private sectors}} to assess whether potential public projects are suited for PPP.

40|$|Synapses {{are basic}} units that mediate the {{communication}} between neurons and their target cells. The formation of synapse is regulated by secreted factors, receptors, adhesion molecules and intracellular signaling molecules. The interplay between positive and <b>negative</b> <b>factors</b> determines synapse assembling, remodeling and elimination, {{resulting in the}} formation of precise synaptic connections. However, compared to the abundant identified positive <b>factors,</b> <b>negative</b> <b>factors</b> are largely unknown. We have recently shown that Wnt 3 a acts as a <b>negative</b> <b>factor</b> that inhibits postsynaptic differentiation at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the synapse formed between motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers. The clustering of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) guarantees efficient and accurate neurotransmission and is a hallmark for postsynaptic differentiation at the NMJ. We found that treatment with Wnt 3 a or upregulation of β-catenin inhibited the formation of AChR clusters. Furthermore, we investigated the underlying mechanism and found that Wnt/β-catenin signaling negatively regulated AChR clustering by downregulating the expression of Rapsyn, an AChR-associated protein required for formation and stabilization of AChR clusters...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (hereinafter {{referred}} to as Hong Kong) is an international leading commercial hub, particularly in Asia. In order to keep up its reputation a number of large public works projects have been considered. Public-private partnership (PPP) has increasingly been suggested for these projects, but the suitability of using this procurement method in Hong Kong {{is yet to be}} studied empirically. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to specifically consider whether PPPs should be used to procure public works projects in Hong Kong by studying the attractive and <b>negative</b> <b>factors</b> for adopting PPP. Design/methodology/approach - As part of this study a questionnaire survey was conducted with industrial practitioners. The respondents were requested to rank the importance of 15 attractive <b>factors</b> and 13 <b>negative</b> <b>factors</b> for adopting PPP. Findings - The results found that in general the top attractive factors ranked by respondents from Hong Kong were efficiency related: these included "Provide an integrated solution (for public infrastructure/services) ", "Facilitate creative and innovative approaches", and "Solve the problem of public sector budget restraint". It was found that Australian respondents also shared similar findings to those in Hong Kong, but the UK respondents showed a higher priority to those economic driven attractive factors. Also, the ranking of the attractive and <b>negative</b> <b>factors</b> for adopting PPP showed that on average the attractive factors were scored higher than the <b>negative</b> <b>factors.</b> Originality/value - The results of this research have enabled a comparison of the attractive and <b>negative</b> <b>factors</b> for adopting PPP between three administrative systems. These findings have confirmed that PPP is a suitable means to procure large public projects, which are believed to be useful and interesting to PPP researchers and practitioners.

The overall Nutripoint score of the food is the result. The higher the value, the more nutrition per calorie (nutrient density) and the least <b>negative</b> <b>factors</b> in the food. Thus, the higher the Nutripoint score, the better the food for overall health. The system rates 3600+ foods including basic foods like apples and oranges, fast-foods, and brand-name foods.|$|R
