40|$|SUMMARY The {{effects of}} {{ventricular}} fibrillation and subsequent resuscitation on the microcirculation of the cerebral cortex were studied with microangiographic and fluorescent protein tracer techniques. Immediately after revival, a transient period of impaired cerebral perfusion occurred before complete recovery from cir-culatory arrest was obtained. A circulatory arrest of longer than ten minutes, followed by {{four to six}} hours of resuscitation, caused defects of cortical capillary filling in both microangiography and Trypan blue fluorescence. This was considered to represent impair-ment of cortical perfusion, most likely due to edema. Cardiac arrest up to 12 minutes and subsequent resuscitation per se caused no blood-brain barrier damage. Minimal blood-brain barrier damage occurred in one dog following uncomplicated revival from a 14 -minute arrest and in animals with prolonged hypertension post-resuscitation. Up to three consecutive <b>carotid</b> <b>angiographies</b> did not cause blood-brain barrier damage in the postischemic brain...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the value of}} a metal artefact reduction (MAR) algorithm with iterative reconstructions for dental hardware in <b>carotid</b> CT <b>angiography.</b> METHODS: Twenty-four patients (six of which were women; mean age 70 [*]±[*] 12  years) with dental hardware undergoing <b>carotid</b> CT <b>angiography</b> were included. Datasets were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and using a MAR algorithm employing normalisation and an iterative frequency-split (IFS) approach. Three blinded, independent readers measured CT attenuation values and evaluated image quality and degrees of artefacts using axial images, multi-planar reformations (MPRs) and maximal intensity projections (MIP) of the carotid arteries. RESULTS: CT attenuation values of the internal carotid artery on images with metal artefacts were significantly higher in FBP (324 [*]±[*] 104 HU) datasets compared with those reconstructed with IFS (278 [*]±[*] 114 HU; P[*]<[*] 0. 001) and with FBP on images without metal artefacts (293 [*]±[*] 106 HU; P[*]=[*] 0. 006). Quality of IFS images was rated significantly higher on axial, MPR and MIP images (P[*]<[*] 0. 05, each), and readers found significantly less artefacts impairing the diagnostic confidence of the internal carotid artery (P[*]<[*] 0. 05, each). CONCLUSION: The MAR algorithm with the IFS approach allowed for a significant reduction of artefacts from dental hardware in <b>carotid</b> CT <b>angiography,</b> hereby increasing image quality and improving the accuracy of CT attenuation measurements. KEY POINTS: • CT angiography of the neck has proven value for evaluating carotid disease • Neck CT angiography images are often degraded by artefacts from dental implants • A metal artefact reduction algorithm with iterative reconstruction reduces artefacts significantly • Visualisation of the internal carotid artery is improved...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: A {{prototype}} endovascular electromechanical clot-extraction {{device was}} fabricated {{using a combination}} of shape memory polymer and shape memory nickel-titanium alloy (nitinol). Five embolic vascular occlusions were created in 4 rabbits by injecting thermally coagulated blood through a 4 F catheter in the common <b>carotid</b> artery. <b>Angiography</b> immediately after clot injection showed complete or partial occlusion of the common <b>carotid</b> artery. Posttreatment <b>angiography</b> showed complete (2 / 5), partial (2 / 5), or no (1 / 5) restoration of blood flow. Most strokes are caused by cerebral thromboembolic arte-rial occlusion and are conventionally treated with intra-venous thrombolytic drugs. Drawbacks associated with this treatment, including the narrow (3 -hour) therapeutic window and strict exclusion criteria imposed to mitigate the risk of hemorrhage, have prompted the development of alternative nonpharmacologic therapies.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{reported}} investigation on 118 cases of this disease in the previous paper, which suggested marked discrepancy of its clinical symptoms between the juvenile form and adult one. Moreover, it has been pointed out that serial bilateral <b>carotid</b> and vertebral <b>angiography</b> should be absolutely necessary to distinguish those cases from other occlusive diseases of the internal carotid, and suggested that this disease would be {{a particular type of}} cerebral vascular abnormality of the Japanese. Postmortem examination on five autopsy cases has been done up to the present time, but the pathological findings brought no contribution to the pathogenesis of the disease. Therefore animal experiment has been attempted to elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease. Complete or incomplete occlusion has been performed bilaterally on the dog brain at the site of carotid siphon (C(1)) immediately distal portion to the origin of the posterior communicating artery. The arteries were successfully clipped in 8 dogs. Bilateral <b>carotid</b> <b>angiographies</b> was carried out with the intervals (from 3 months to 12 months) after the surgery on each dogs, but abnormal vascular network was never observed in all cases. The solid molding specimen of the circle of Willis also demonstrated no abnormal vascular network {{at the site of the}} occlusion in these experimental dogs. Histological examination revieled a minimal thickning of the wall of the arteries at the distal part of the occlusion and dilatation of artrioles which belong to the middle cerebral arteries. It could be denied by this experiment that the acquired occlusion of the circle of Willis will bring forth the abnormal vascular network at the base of the brain. The pathogenesis of the disease is still obscure but it is in my opinion that the previous clinical investigation as well as this animal experiment suggested congenital vascular malformation of the circle of Willis...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess the safety and {{effectiveness}} of carotid artery stenting (CAS) with proximal cerebral protection in patients showing string sign at <b>carotid</b> <b>angiography.</b> BackgroundPresence of string sign is a well-known factor for adverse events in patients with severe carotid artery disease undergoing CAS. MethodsWe used retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients who underwent <b>carotid</b> <b>angiography</b> with the intention to undergo carotid stenting and had angiographically documented string sign in the target lesion. ResultsFrom October 2006 to August 2007, 25 patients (21 men and 4 women, mean age 70. 9 ± 8. 7 years) presented with string sign during <b>carotid</b> <b>angiography.</b> This was 6. 0 % of a total of 416 patients studied during the time of the study. Twenty patients (80. 0 %) were symptomatic, and 5 (20. 0 %) were asymptomatic. Carotid artery stenting was performed successively in all patients. Proximal cerebral protection was applied in all but 1 patient. The 30 -day death/stroke rate was 0 %. At 12 -month follow-up neurological events did not occur; 1 patient developed a nonfatal myocardial infarction, and another patient died from noncardiac cause. The 12 -month death/stroke rate was 4. 0 %. ConclusionsCarotid stenting under proximal cerebral protection seems to be a feasible and safe procedure to manage patients with severe carotid stenosis in presence of angiographic string sign.

40|$|AbstractThe way American {{medicine}} is practiced is changing rapidly. By {{the beginning of}} the next century, most Americans may be enrolled in for-profit managed care plans in which physicians are responsible for both a budget and a population of patients. As health care is revolutionized, the overriding issue is whether the mission of health care organizations will be simply to contain costs, or whether it will be to increase the value (i. e., the quality) that we get for the money we are willing to spend on health care. The {{purpose of this article is}} to illustrate for carotid endarterectomy how quality can remain on the health care reform agenda. Vascular surgeons must assume a leadership role, and they must be willing to alter their practice patterns. More specifically, they should: (1) support and facilitate the development of clinically-detailed multispecialty criteria that describe under what circumstances carotid endarterectomy is both appropriate and necessary; (2) support the development of a system for publicly reporting outcome data by physician and hospital; (3) support regionalization of carotid endarterectomy; (4) conduct a prospective assessment of appropriateness before the procedure is performed; (5) consider changing the system by which <b>carotid</b> <b>angiographies</b> are read to increase their reliability; and (6) help develop a system to ensure that people who need carotid endarterectomy are offered the procedure.

40|$|AbstractCarotid artery {{stenosis}} (CAS) {{is primarily}} caused by atherosclerotic plaque. Progressive inflammation {{may contribute to}} the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. The platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) is a new and simple marker that indicates inflammation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the use of the PLR to determine the severity of CAS. One hundred forty patients were chosen from among patients who underwent <b>carotid</b> <b>angiography</b> in our institution. Symptomatic patients with stenosis > 50 % in the carotid arteries and asymptomatic patients with stenosis > 80 % were diagnosed via <b>carotid</b> <b>angiography</b> as having critical stenosis. Patients were classified into two groups. Group 1 included patients who had critical CAS, whereas Group 2 included patients with noncritical CAS, as determined by <b>carotid</b> <b>angiography.</b> Correlations between the PLR and the severity of CAS were analyzed. There {{were no significant differences in}} sex and age between the two groups. The PLR was 162. 5  ±  84. 7 in the noncritical CAS group patients and 94. 9  ±  60. 3 in the critical CAS group patients (p <  0. 0001). The PLR value of 117. 1 had 89 % sensitivity and 68 % specificity for CAS [95 % confidence interval, 0. 043 – 0. 159; area under the curve, 0. 101  ±  0. 03) ]. In this study, we have shown that PLR values may be associated with critical stenosis in at least one of the carotid arteries.
