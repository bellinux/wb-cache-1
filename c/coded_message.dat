5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 10 February 1913 Dr Edward Atkinson and Lieutenant Harry Pennell rowed into the New Zealand port of Oamaru, from where they sent a <b>coded</b> <b>message</b> back to the expedition's New Zealand agent, Joseph Kinsey, informing him of the fate of Scott and his party. Atkinson and Pennell then boarded a train to meet the Terra Nova in Lyttelton near Christchurch.|$|E

One field test is recorded in Tucson, AZ., USA, where we send and received 3 ‐short messages. One possible application of this method is to send <b>coded</b> <b>messages</b> from trapped miners to the surface.

There is another number painted on the wall, which Black recognizes as a case file number from {{his time in the}} FBI—the case {{concerned}} Avatar, a serial killer who was able to evade all attempts at capture. Avatar sends Black a <b>coded</b> <b>message</b> twice, and places a woman in the chair on the feed, keeping her face hidden. Roedecker realizes that, through image differencing, the two messages contain additional information—a sound clip from The Mikado, known to be Avatar's favourite operetta.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{soon began}} {{detecting}} signs of preparations {{for a new}} convoy. A Japanese floatplane of the type normally used for anti-submarine patrols in advance of convoys was sighted on 7 February 1943. The Allied Air Forces South West Pacific Area commander – Lieutenant General George Kenney – ordered an increase in reconnaissance patrols over Rabaul. On 14 February, aerial photographs were taken that showed 79 vessels in port, including 45 merchant ships and six transports. It was clear that another convoy was being prepared, but its destination was unknown. On 16 February, naval codebreakers in Melbourne (FRUMEL) and Washington, D.C. finished decrypting and translating a <b>coded</b> <b>message</b> revealing the Japanese intention to land convoys at Wewak, Madang and Lae. Subsequently, codebreakers decrypted {{a message from the}} Japanese 11th Air Fleet to the effect that destroyers and six transports would reach Lae about 5 March. Another report indicated that they would reach Lae by 12 March. On 22 February, reconnaissance aircraft reported 59 merchant vessels in the harbour at Rabaul.|$|E

25|$|In 1895, José Turiano Santiago, a close {{personal}} friend of Bonifacio, was expelled because a <b>coded</b> <b>message</b> of the Katipunan {{fell into the}} hands of a Spanish priest teaching at the University of Santo Tomas. Since the priest was a friend of Santiago's sister, he and his half-brother Restituto Javier were suspected of betrayal, but the two would remain loyal to the Katipunan and Santiago would even join the Philippine revolutionary forces in the Philippine–American War.

25|$|At 19:00 {{hours on}} 29 August 1944, Slovak Defence Minister General Ferdinand Čatloš {{announced}} on state radio that Germany had occupied Slovakia. At 20:00, Golian sent the <b>coded</b> <b>message</b> to all units {{to begin the}} uprising. But instead of adhering to the agreed plan, on 30 August Colonel Talský and the entire eastern Slovak Air Force flew to a prearranged landing zone in Poland to join the Soviet Army, and abandoned the two divisions at Prešov. The two divisions, left in chaos and without leadership, were quickly disarmed {{on the afternoon of}} 30 August without a single shot. Consequently, the uprising commenced prematurely and lost a crucial component of their plan, as well as the two most heavily armed divisions.|$|E
25|$|Danzan and Choibalsan {{arrived in}} Verkhneudinsk, {{the capital of}} the pro-Soviet Far Eastern Republic, {{in the first part of}} July. They met with Boris Shumyatsky, then acting head of the government. Shumyatsky knew little about them, and for three weeks dodged their demands for a speedy Soviet {{decision}} whether or not to provide military assistance to the Mongolians against the Chinese. Finally, perhaps at Shumyatsky's suggestion, they sent a telegram to members of the MPP in Urga with a <b>coded</b> <b>message</b> that they should obtain a letter, stamped with the seal of the Bogd Khaan, formally requesting Soviet assistance. The MPP did succeed in obtaining a letter from the Khaan's court, albeit with difficulty. Five members of the Party—D. Losol, Dambyn Chagdarjav, Dogsom, L. Dendev, and Sükhbaatar—brought it to Verkhneudinsk. When the seven men met with Shumyatsky, he told them that he had no authority to make a decision on their request; they must go to Irkutsk.|$|E

25|$|In China, Professor Max Epper (known as Wizard) is {{investigating}} the tomb of Chinese Philosopher Laozi, owner of the Philosopher's Stone. With his research partner, Yobu 'Tank' Tanaka, Wizard discovers the cryptic message referring to the Tartarus Sunspot {{and the use of}} the Sa-Benben, or Firestone, the top piece of the Capstone from the previous book. They find another message, saying that the first pillar must be laid 100 days before the Return. Wizard sends a <b>coded</b> <b>message</b> to Jack West in Australia, just before a contingent of Chinese military arrive to capture them, intended to use Wizard's knowledge to find the Six Sacred Stones. Jack West receives Wizard's message, just before the farm is attacked by the Chinese army, participating in the Talisman Sabre military exercises. West escapes to the Halicarnassus, his private plane, with Lily, whom he adopted at the end of the previous book; Alby Calvin, Lily's friend; Zoe and Sky Monster, who are visiting the farm. As they leave, Jack grabs the Firestone from its hiding place, along with Wizard's research journal, and reads it whilst travelling to Dubai.|$|E

Although she had not received the advance warning of the <b>coded</b> <b>message,</b> U-66 was one of the two ambush U-boats that actually saw parts of the British fleet. At 09:00 on 31 May, U-66 sent out a wireless report of eight battleships, light cruisers, and destroyers on a northerly course [...] east of Kinnaird Head. U-66 was unable to make any attacks on the ships she reported due to the presence of screening vessels. The failure of the submarine ambush to sink any British capital ships allowed the full Grand Fleet to engage the numerically inferior High Seas Fleet in the Battle of Jutland, which took place 31 May – 1 June.|$|E

In UB-12s group, only UB-10 sighted the Harwich forces, and they were too far away to mount an attack. The failure of the submarine ambush to sink any British capital ships allowed the full Grand Fleet to engage the numerically inferior High Seas Fleet in the Battle of Jutland, which took place 31 May – 1 June.|$|E
500|$|In mid-May 1916, Scheer {{completed}} {{plans to}} draw out part of the British Grand Fleet.

U-66 was one of nine U-boats that put out to sea beginning on 17 May to scout the central North Sea for signs of the British fleet. Completing five days of scouting, U-66, along with , , , sister boat , , and , took up position off the Firth of Forth on 23 May.
