5|$|The {{duration}} of each touring show was traditionally split into two acts of an hour each separated by a 30-minute interval; however, as of 2014, due to <b>cost</b> <b>cutting</b> issues, the shows have now {{been reduced to a}} shorter 55-minute first act followed by a 50-minute second act, still including a 30-minute interval. Permanent shows are usually 90 minutes in length without any intermission. This excludes Joyà (the permanent show in Riviera Maya, Mexico), which is only 70 minutes in length. Typically touring shows as well as resident shows perform a standard 10 shows a week. Touring shows usually have one 'dark day' (with no performances) while resident shows have two.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Leslie's unique tone {{is due to}} {{the fact}} that the system is at least {{partially}} enclosed, whereby linear louvres along the sides and front of the unit can vent the sound from within the box after the sound has bounced around inside, mellowing it. The crossover is deliberately set to 800Hz to give the optimum balance between the horn and the drum, and is considered an integral part of the speaker. The tone is also affected by the wood used. Tone differences, due to <b>cost</b> <b>cutting</b> using particle board for speaker and rotor shelves instead of the previous plywood, are evident in the Leslie's sound. The thinner ply of the top of the cabinet adds a certain resonance as well. Like an acoustic instrument, a Leslie's tone is uniquely defined by its cabinet design and construction, the amplifier, crossover and speakers used, and the motors — not merely by the spinning of rotors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For {{economical}} {{and environmental}} reasons, {{the aim of}} this research is hence to monitor the cutting conditions with the dry cutting, the wet cutting, and the mist cutting to obtain the proper cutting condition for the plain carbon steel with the ball end milling based on the consideration of the surface roughness of the machined parts, the life of the cutting tools, the use of the cutting fluids, the density of the particles of cutting fluids dispersed in the working area, and the <b>cost</b> of <b>cutting.</b> The experimentally obtained results of the relation between tool wear and surface roughness, the relation between tool wear and cutting force, and the relation between cutting force and surface roughness are correspondent with the same trend. The phenomena of surface roughness and tool wear {{can be explained by the}} in-process cutting forces. The models of the tool wear with the cutting conditions and the cutting times are proposed to estimate the tool cost for the different cooling strategies based on the experimental data using the multiple regression technique. The <b>cutting</b> <b>cost</b> is calculated from the <b>costs</b> of <b>cutting</b> tool and cutting fluid. The mist cutting gives the lowest <b>cutting</b> <b>cost</b> as compared to others.
