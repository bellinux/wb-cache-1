An integral part of the analysis is differential fertility which focuses on women's fertility differences depending on marital status, educational attainment, economic activity and religious belief. The demographic analyses were used as the methods of the thesis, namely the <b>completed</b> <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> (average number of live births per woman of one generation {{at the end of her}} reproductive period), order-specific <b>completed</b> <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> and the parity progression ration (the probability that a woman with i children will have i + 1 children). The decline of <b>completed</b> <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> seems to be a permanent phenomenon and traditional determinants of fertility still have some influence. A growing proportion of children are born to single mothers. There is an increasing proportion of university graduates, whose <b>completed</b> <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> is the lowest among educational categories. Women claiming to religious beliefs, or the Roman Catholic Church, have the highest value of the <b>completed</b> <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> of all categories according to religious beliefs.

Aim of this diploma thesis is to analyse trends in fertility and family {{policy in the}} Visegrad countries. The goal was {{to find out how}} the post- 1990 approach on family policy and response to changing social conditions differed in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The study describes settings for each family benefits including the changes in the examined period of 1990 - 2013. On that basis 5 -year periods were defined and assessed. The fertility analysis is focused on the total and <b>completed</b> <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> and also by parity and age-specific fertility rates. The period effect was estimated using age-period-cohort (APC) models which decompose fertility rates for age, period and cohort effects. Models were based on fertility of women aged 25 - 49 years in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. Results in all three countries suggest that the decline in fertility in 1995 - 1999 wasa reaction to the changing socio-economic conditions in 1990 - 1994. However, the negative effect of this period was mitigated by changes in the distribution of cohorts. The period 2000 - 2004 has brought many positive changes that were behind [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of contemporary trends in fertility and female labour supply is well recognised. Unfortunately, {{our understanding of}} these inter-related phenomena has been hampered by the difficulties {{that are associated with}} formulating a structural model of behaviour that reflects the joint nature of the fertility and labour supply decisions {{in the context of an}} uncertain future. In this paper we describe a model that we have developed to address these issues of concern. The model is calibrated to survey data for the cohort of women born in the United Kingdom in 1953, and its out-of-sample properties are explored with reference to data reported for the cohort of women born in 1963. Our analysis explains the observed delay in the timing of fertility, the reduction in <b>completed</b> <b>fertility</b> <b>rates,</b> and the rise in female labour market participation, as responses to the coincident decline in marriage and the growth of the labour incomes earned by women. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new modelling of demographic {{events in the}} microsimulation model Destinie: union formations, union disruptions and births. The previous modelling {{was based on the}} 1997 Insee Survey on Young People and Job Histories, whose sample was of limited size (20 000 persons aged 19 to 45). This new version is based on the 1999 Family History Survey whose sample is large enough (280 000 persons aged at least 18) to take into account more covariates than before. In particular we systematically introduce age as a covariate; the age at leaving school, the only variable that represents social heterogeneity in the model Destinie, is also used more systematically than in the previous version. The probabilities are estimated between 1995 and 1999 using logistic regressions. As this period does not necessary correspond to a steady state, we have to adjust the intercepts in the equations so that simulations are consistent with some aggregates. In particular, simulations are consistent with a fertility of 1. 9 children per woman, which corresponds to the observed fertility since 2000, and an average age at birth of 30 years. For women, simulations lead to satisfactory results for <b>completed</b> <b>fertility,</b> <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> by age and marital status at each age. Thus, the marital status appears to be a valid covariate for modelling transitions on the labour market. Results for men remain less satisfactory. microsimulation, demographic trends, fertility...|$|R

The aims of this study were: first, to model invasive BC incidence trends in Catalonia (Spain) taking into account reproductive and screening data; and second, to quantify the extent of BC overdiagnosis. We modeled the incidence of invasive BC using a Poisson regression model. Explanatory variables were: age at diagnosis and cohort characteristics (<b>completed</b> <b>fertility</b> <b>rate,</b> percentage of women that use mammography at age 50, and year of birth). This model also was used to estimate the background incidence {{in the absence of}} screening. We used a probabilistic model to estimate the expected BC incidence if women in the population used mammography as reported in health surveys. The difference between the observed and expected cumulative incidences provided an estimate of overdiagnosis. Incidence of invasive BC increased, especially in cohorts born from 1940 to 1955. The biggest increase was observed in these cohorts between the ages of 50 to 65 years, where the final BC incidence rates more than doubled the initial ones. Dissemination of mammography was significantly associated with BC incidence and overdiagnosis. Our estimates of overdiagnosis ranged from 0. 4 % to 46. 6 %, for women born around 1935 and 1950, respectively. Our results support the existence of overdiagnosis in Catalonia attributed to mammography usage, and the limited malignant potential of some tumors may play an important role. Women should be better informed about this risk. Research should be oriented towards personalized screening and risk assessment tool...|$|E

Moreover, {{it is not known}} what parities contribute to the higher CFR among more highly educated men. Objective: To describe men’s fertility by age, parity, and education in Finland. Methods: The study is based on register data covering the male cohort born in 1940 ‒ 1950 (N= 38, 838). Education was measured at ages 30 ‒ 34 and classified as basic, lower secondary, upper secondary, and tertiary. Fertility was measured until ages 59 ‒ 69. We calculated completed and age-specific fertility rates, and decomposed the educational gradient in CFR into parity-specific contributions. Results: The more highly educated men had more children (CFR: basic 1. 71 and tertiary 2. 06), had them later (mean age at having the first child: basic 26. 1 and tertiary 28. 1), and had them within a shorter interval (interquartile range of age at having the first child: basic 5. 8 and tertiary 5. 2). The educational gradient in the cumulative fertility rate was negative at young ages but turned positive by the early thirties. High levels of childlessness among those with a basic education explained three-quarters of the CFR difference between the lowest and highest educational groups. Fertility at ages above 45 was low and did not widen the educational gradient in CFR. Conclusions: The fact that highly educated men have more children than their counterparts with less education is largely attributable to higher fertility levels at older ages and the lower probability of remaining childless.

40|$|The {{population}} projections by the German Federal Statistical Office show {{a likely}} {{decrease in the}} number of births in the 2020 s.

However, the 2011 census led to revisions in the population size, age structure and consequently in relative fertility measures such as period and cohort <b>fertility</b> <b>rates.</b> The objective of this article is to quantify the effects of the 2011 census on these fertility statistics and to check the validity of previous findings for fertility trends on the census-adjusted data basis. A special focus is laid on analyses of the cohort fertility and the consequences of ever-later entry into motherhood on the <b>completed</b> <b>fertility</b> and on parity distribution. Using numerous findings, we will show that a continuous rise in the <b>completed</b> <b>fertility</b> in the coming two decades cannot be realised without a reversal of fertility behaviour. A greater increase in fertility from the age of 30 onwards would be necessary to offset the decrease in fertility for ages under 30 - a trend which intensified with cohort 1974 - and thereby stabilise the total cohort <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> at a relatively low level between 1. 5 and 1. 6 births per woman. A rise and subsequent stabilisation of the total cohort <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> at the level of at least 1. 6 births per woman would, additionally, necessitate a trend reversal in the development of childlessness and distinct changes in birth timing.

Two hundred twenty-five recipient families out of some 536 families on the list were interviewed during May and June of 1968 by nine graduate and undergraduate students in Sociology and Social Work {{with the help of}} Social Welfare workers and Navajo interpreters. The study was primarily concerned with the following objectives: (1) to study the level and age patterns of fertility of a group of selected Navajo Indians, (2) to investigate the factors which might affect the fertility, desired fami. ly size, and ideal family size, (3) to study the knowledge of and the extent of the use of birth control methods among the selected group, (4) to compare the findings of previous fertility studies dealing with other groups to those found among the selected group of Navajos. The data indicate that the fertility of Navajo women was very high, reaching the <b>completed</b> <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> of 9. 2 children for women aged 45 - 49 years as compared with that of 2. 4 children and 2. 8 children for white and non-white women in the United States in 1960 respectively. The number of children ever born among the total ever married women was 6. 6 children. The number of children the Navajo women considered ideal for a couple in general and for the Navajo family in particular was 7. 1 children and 7. 7 children respectively. A strong inverse relationship was observed among Navajo women between fertility level and several social variables. The fertility of women who knew English was as much as 3. 9 percent below that of women who did not. Fertility was also lower among those who had more frequent contact with white people. Although the proportion of women who knew any methods of birth control was very low (only 50 percent of the total women), the fertility of these women was considerably lower than that of those who did not know anything about birth control...|$|E

In the 1930 s Swedish birth rates {{had fallen to}} levels close to the death rates and in public discourse this was perceived as a major social and national crisis, spurring a range of social policy reforms. While total <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> in Sweden have varied over large spans the <b>completed</b> cohort <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> are almost constant around 2 children per woman for women born in the 20 th century. Using unique data for the years 1930 - 1997 on public expenditure per eligible child for schools, child allowances and child care we estimate age-specific fertility for broad age groups {{as a function of}} these variables. The results indicate that the age group 25 - 29 is most sensitive to variations in this public expenditure thus providing a tentative explanation of the swings in period fertility in terms of policy induced tempo variation. School expenditure is negatively correlated to fertility while child care and child allowance is positively correlated. This pattern is consistent with a quantity-quality trade-off by the parents. To check the predictive power of the model we use data from 1998 - 2007 and get an excellent prediction of the fertility turn-around after 1999 for all age groups except 35 and above where we tend to under-predict at the 10 -year horizon. Further research along these lines is needed to uncover the causal mechanisms of these very stable correlations. fertility swings; tempo effects; public child expenditure...|$|R
40|$|Both the {{material}} and non-material aspects of social life are viewed as determinants of major transformation in the patterns of fatal disease and injury. A 'worst case' scenario for the burden of fatal disease is taken as a poor agrarian society precariously dependent on starchy staples and a narrow range of other foods. In such a society life expectancy may be as low as 20. However in many 'pre-modern' societies the regime of roughly matching fertility and mortality levels was set at a 'submaximal' level, with <b>completed</b> <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> moderated by marriage conventions. The relative importance of the factors contributing to the historical decline in fatal infection continues to be debated. Evidence on {{the central role of}} maternal literacy in the recent decline in Third World mortality suggests the importance of changes in the body of civil society as well as the activities of professionals and public agencies. The decline in fatal infections has been offset to varying extents by an increase in non-communicable disease (NCD) : the Mediterranean and East Asia having smaller epidemics of NCDs and Eastern Europe having sustained rises of NCDs. Most industrialised countries have experienced declines in overall NCD mortality in the last 2 decades. Both the fall in fatal infection and the rise and early fall of NCDs can usefully be viewed against the baseline of hunter gatherer cultures. When this is done, the relationship between economic development and disease is seen to be complex. Much 'progress' has been achieved by countering (and then doing better than countering) the adverse effects of earlier developments. Although most members of the generation now alive have experienced marked health benefits from economic and technical advance, it is unclear whether these gains can be both sustained and generalised. It is possible that adverse lagged effects of current industrial (and military) activities will disrupt the habitat of future generations of our species through processes such as stratospheric ozone depletion, global warming and others as yet unpredicted. Modern hygienists have dealt successively with influences on survival mainly operating in early life (infection) and influence operating across the lifespan (determinants of chronic disease). They have now to deal with even greater separations in time and space between potential health determinants and their ultimate effects.

40|$|This Bachelor thesis compares {{selected}} {{period and}} cohort characteristics of fertility for 15 chosen European {{countries that are}} divided into four groups: post-communist countries, Northern European countries, Southern European countries and Western European countries. The aim of this thesis {{is to find out}} whether differences among selected groups of countries exist and whether differences between post-communist countries {{and the rest of the}} countries still prevail. Additionally, the thesis aims to indicate the aggregate <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> achieved, the average age of mothers at birth, and, finally, the proportion of children born outside marriage in countries in question. Moreover, the development of <b>completed</b> <b>fertility</b> of women born after World War II is examined to reveal whether the decline in cross-period total fertility has been later compensated at least partially, or whether the total <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> constantly decreases. The Eurostat and the Human Fertility databases were used to acquire elementary data. The data were later analysed. According to results, the total <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> in all selected countries during the second half of the last century had decreased. In some cases, it had fallen even under the level necessary to ensure basic reproduction of the population. During the present century, the aggregate total <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> have been fairly stable; in some countries, even moderate growth can be seen. Despite the initial decline over the past decade, the mean age of women at childbirth has been increasing in most of the countries, and oscillates around the age of 30. Also, the high proportion of children born outside marriage can be seen. Currently, apart from few exceptions, the proportion of children born outside marriage ranges between 40 and 60 %.

The point estimates are different enough between the three models to suggest that fertility should be estimated with a model that accounts for both fertility being a non-negative count variable and the explanatory variables being endogenous. My results are broadly consistent with the literature on determinants of <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|The Netherlands {{has seen}} a {{considerable}} decline of the period total <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> and delayed childbearing, just like all other European countries. The drop in fertility, however, {{has not been as}} sharp as in many other regions of Europe. The period total <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> in the Netherlands has stabilized since the late 1970 s at around 1. 6 children per woman, and it has even risen slightly since 1995. In addition, although the Netherlands has one of the oldest first-time mothers, <b>completed</b> <b>fertility</b> is still rather high compared to other European countries, suggesting a strong "catching up" of births by women in their thirties. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the main driving forces behind specific fertility trends in the Netherlands. Among other factors, it focuses on changing patterns of home leaving and union formation, declining partnership stability, and the growing acceptability and use of contraception. The chapter also looks at prolonged education, rising labor-force participation of women, economic uncertainties, the growing migrant population, and family policies. Data allowing, and to the extent possible, we examine the effects of these factors on decision-making about parenthood and the timing of childbearing...|$|R
