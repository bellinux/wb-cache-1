5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{was first}} classified by French zoologist François Marie Daudin as Crocodilus mississipiensis in 1801. In 1807 Georges Cuvier created the genus Alligator; the American alligator shares this genus with the <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligator.</b> They are grouped {{in the family}} Alligatoridae with the caimans. The superfamily Alligatoroidea includes all crocodilians (fossil and extant) that are {{more closely related to}} the American alligator than to either the Nile crocodile or the gharial.|$|E
5|$|The {{ranges of}} the American and <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligator</b> extend into regions that {{sometimes}} experience periods of frost in winter. Being ectothermic, the internal body temperature of crocodilians falls {{as the temperature}} drops, and they become sluggish. They may become more active on warm days, but do not usually feed at all during the winter. In cold weather, they remain submerged with their tails in deeper, less cold water and their nostrils just projecting through the surface. If ice forms on the water, they maintain ice-free breathing holes, {{and there have been}} occasions when their snouts have become frozen into the ice. Temperature sensing probes implanted in wild American alligators have found that their core body temperatures can descend to around , but as long as they remain able to breathe they show no ill effects when the weather warms up.|$|E
5|$|Members of this {{superfamily}} first {{arose in}} the late Cretaceous. Leidyosuchus of Alberta is the earliest known genus. Fossil alligatoroids have been found throughout Eurasia as land bridges across both the North Atlantic and the Bering Strait have connected North America to Eurasia during the Cretaceous, Paleogene, and Neogene periods. Alligators and caimans split in North America during the late Cretaceous and the latter reached South America by the Paleogene, before {{the closure of the}} Isthmus of Panama during the Neogene period. The <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligator</b> likely descended from a lineage that crossed the Bering land bridge during the Neogene. The modern American alligator is well represented in the fossil record of the Pleistocene. The alligator's full mitochondrial genome was sequenced in the 1990s and it suggests the animal evolved at a rate similar to mammals and greater than birds and most cold-blooded vertebrates. However, the full genome, published in 2014, suggests that the alligator evolved much more slowly than mammals and birds.|$|E
40|$|Decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), a {{replacement}} for decabromodiphenyl ether (deca-BDE), was investigated in captive <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligators</b> from China. DBDPE was detected in adult tissues, neonates and eggs of <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligators</b> with concentrations ranging from 4. 74 - 192, 0. 24 - 1. 94, and 0. 01 - 0. 51 ng g(- 1) lipid weight, respectively. Compared to PBDEs and PCBs, DBDPE contamination was limited in <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligators.</b> Additionally, DBDPE concentrations in adult muscles were one to three orders of magnitude higher than those in neonates and eggs, suggesting the limited maternal transfer potential of DBDPE in <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligators.</b> This is the first study to report the occurrence of DBDPE in <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligators...</b>|$|R
50|$|Captive {{breeding}} programs, {{the first}} initiated in the 1970s, {{have been successful}} for the species, with over 10,000 <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligators</b> living in captivity. Captive-born <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligators</b> have been reintroduced back into their native range, to boost the wild population. These releases have proven successful with individuals adapting well to a life in the wild and also breeding.|$|R

5|$|Various {{types of}} aquatic {{habitats}} {{are used by}} different crocodilians. Some species are relatively more terrestrial and prefer swamps, ponds, and the edges of lakes, where they can bask {{in the sun and}} there is plenty of plant life supporting a diverse fauna. Others spend more time in the water and inhabit the lower stretches of rivers, mangrove swamps, and estuaries. These habitats also have a rich flora and provide plenty of food. The Asian gharials find the fish on which they feed in the pools and backwaters of swift rivers. South American dwarf caimans inhabit cool, fast-flowing streams, often near waterfalls, and other caimans live in warmer, turbid lakes and slow-moving rivers. The crocodiles are mainly river dwellers, and the <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligator</b> is found in slow-moving, turbid rivers flowing across China's floodplains. The American alligator is an adaptable species and inhabits swamps, rivers, or lakes with clear or turbid water. Climatic factors also affect crocodilians' distribution locally. During the dry season, caimans can be restricted to deep pools in rivers for several months; in the rainy season, much of the savannah in the Venezuelan llanos is flooded, and they disperse widely across the plain. Desert crocodiles in Mauritania have adapted to their arid environment by staying in caves or burrows in a state of aestivation during the driest periods. When it rains, the reptiles gather at gueltas.|$|E
5|$|The gharial has {{undergone}} a chronic long-term decline, combined with a rapid short-term decline, leading the IUCN to list the species as critically endangered. In 1946, the gharial population had been widespread, numbering around 5,000 to 10,000; by 2006, however, it had declined 96–98%, reduced to {{a small number of}} widely spaced subpopulations of fewer than 235 individuals. This long-term decline had a number of causes, including egg collection and hunting, such as for indigenous medicine. The rapid decline of about 58% between 1997 and 2006 was caused by increasing use of gill nets and the loss of riverine habitat. The gharial population continues to be threatened by environmental hazards such as heavy metals and protozoan parasites, but as of 2013 numbers are rising, due to the protection of nests against egg predators. The <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligator</b> was historically widespread throughout the eastern Yangtze River system but is currently restricted to some areas in southeastern Anhui province thanks to habitat fragmentation and degradation. The wild population is believed to exist only in small fragmented ponds. In 1972, the species was declared a Class I endangered species by the Chinese government and received the maximum amount of legal protection. Since 1979, captive breeding programs were established in China and North America, creating a healthy captive population. In 2008, alligators bred in the Bronx Zoo were successfully reintroduced to Chongming Island. The Philippine crocodile is perhaps the most threatened crocodilian and is considered by the IUCN to be critically endangered. Hunting and destructive fishing habits have reduced its population to around 100 individuals by 2009. In the same year, 50 captive bred crocodiles were released into the wild to help boost the population. Support from local people is crucial for the species survival.|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{differences}} in the relative lengths of the DNA telomere between the matured and the adolescent Chinese alligators（Alligator sinensis）and to offer the possible molecular evidence for judging the age of the Chinese alligators，we applied the PCR method to amplify the telomere DNA of both the matured and the juvenile <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligators</b> In our research. Subsequently, we analyzed and compared the outcomes of the two groups by using a Semi-quantitative technique. The results of our analyses show that the relative average gray value of the blood cells' telomere PCR products of the adolescent group is higher than that of the matured group. These analytical results are indications that the blood cells' telomere DNA sequence of the adolescent <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligators</b> is longer than that of the matured <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligators.</b> Our paper will also discuss the feasibility of the use of the PCR method to determine the relative lengths of the telomere [Acta Zoologica Sinica 54 (6) : 1119 – 1123, 2008]. ...|$|R

500|$|Crocodilians {{are largely}} carnivorous, and the diets of {{different}} species can vary with snout shape and tooth sharpness. Species with sharp teeth and long slender snouts, like the Indian gharial and Australian freshwater crocodile, are specialised for feeding on fish, insects, and crustaceans, while extremely broad-snouted species with blunt teeth, like the <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligator</b> and broad-snouted caiman, specialise in eating hard-shelled molluscs. Species whose snouts and teeth are intermediate {{between these two}} forms, such as the saltwater crocodile and American alligator, have generalised diets and opportunistically feed on invertebrates, fish, [...] amphibians, other reptiles, birds, and mammals. Though mostly carnivorous, several species of crocodilian have been observed to consume fruit, and this {{may play a role}} in seed dispersal.|$|E

2500|$|The Yangtze plays a {{large role}} in the history, culture and economy of China. [...] The prosperous Yangtze River Delta generates as much as 20% of the PRC's GDP. The Yangtze River flows through a wide array of {{ecosystems}} and is habitat to several endemic and endangered species including the <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligator,</b> the finless porpoise, the Chinese paddlefish, the (possibly extinct) Yangtze River dolphin or baiji, and the Yangtze sturgeon.

[...] The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River is the largest hydro-electric power station in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{commercial}} {{use of the}} river, tourism, and pollution, the Yangtze is home to several seriously threatened species of large animals (in addition to fish): the finless porpoise, baiji (Yangtze River dolphin), <b>Chinese</b> <b>alligator,</b> Yangtze giant softshell turtle and Chinese giant salamander. This is the only other place besides the United States that is native to an alligator and paddlefish species. In 2010, the Yangtze population of finless porpoise was 1000 individuals. In December 2006, the Yangtze River dolphin was declared functionally extinct after an extensive search of the river revealed no signs of the dolphin's inhabitance. In 2007, a large, white animal was sighted and photographed in the lower Yangtze and was tentatively presumed to be a baiji. However, as {{there have been no}} confirmed sightings since 2004, the baiji is presumed to be functionally extinct at this time. [...] "Baijis were the last surviving species of a large lineage dating back seventy million years and one of only six species of freshwater dolphins". It has been argued that the extinction of the Yangtze River dolphin was a result of the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, a project that has affected many species of animals and plant life found only in the gorges area.|$|E
