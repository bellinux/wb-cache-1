Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this. The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> influence the debate.|$|E
5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E

25|$|As {{a general}} rule, Wallenstein {{is more about}} {{developing}} territories rather than conquering them. However, it <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> be beneficial to take another player's territory after they have already spent resources to develop it. Because of the reliability of receiving victory points from buildings and the uncertainties of battles due to the cube tower, most players tend to avoid conflict {{in the first year}} in order to amass larger armies for the second year.|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} by The Guardian in 2011, Everett True contested: Kurt sang backing vocals on two songs. He wrote one B-side for Hole ("Old Age"), uncredited. And that was it. It {{would be just as}} accurate and misleading to say that Courtney Love wrote most of Nirvana's third album, In Utero: you <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> see her influence in Kurt's lyrics. Before the pair met, it was often guesswork as to his intentions. Afterwards, his lyrics were far more direct.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem is}} that there are no traces of any Dorians {{anywhere}} until the start of the Geometric period about 950 BC. This simple pottery decoration appears to be correlated with other changes in material culture, such as the introduction of iron weapons and alterations in burial practices from Mycenaean group burials in tholos tombs to individual burials and cremation. These <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> be associated with the historical Dorian settlers, such as those of Sparta in the 10th century BC. However, they appear to have been general over all of Greece; moreover, the new weapons would not have been used in 1200.|$|E

25|$|Many Classical Chinese poems {{were written}} as more-or-less subtle or implied {{complaints}} {{for the treatment}} of the author by the government. This is in part {{due to the nature of}} the imperial examination system as a way of recruiting talented persons into high political office, and the expectations of the talented poet of finding a suitable position within such a society. One example of this is the poetry written to accompany of to follow the eight-fold settings of the Eight Views of Xiaoxiang which were popularized during the Song Dynasty; although, the theme <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> be traced back as far as the Chuci.|$|E
25|$|Gentlemen {{from the}} local YMCA took part in {{football}} matches in the local Glasgow area which gave the club its name. During the inaugural meeting, debate raged over the club's name. Proposals included: 'The Celts'; 'The Northern' and 'Morayshire'. Perhaps such choice of names suggest a Highland influence within the new club. After much deliberation, 'Queen's Park' was adopted and carried, but only {{by a majority of}} one vote. Although Queen's was not the first club in Britain, that honour going to Edinburgh and John Hope's 'Football Club', formed in 1824, they <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> claim to be the first Association club in Scotland. Opposition first {{came in the form of}} a now defunct Glaswegian side called Thistle F.C. and Queen's won 2–0 on 1 August 1868.|$|E

Morton was best known for his work with the Shangri-Las, of whom the New York Dolls were fans, and had also been Johansen's first choice to produce their debut album. Morton had become disenchanted with the music industry and wanted to challenge himself by producing the band's second album: [...] "The Dolls had energy, sort of a disciplined weirdness. I took them into the room as a challenge. I was bored with the music and the business. The Dolls <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> snap you out of boredom." ...|$|E

500|$|Ramsey {{was injured}} during the 1944–45 pre-season, {{ironically}} while playing against Southampton for his battalion team, {{so he did}} not make his first appearance as a professional until December. During the match, against Arsenal at White Hart Lane, Ramsey played centre-half opposite the formidable Arsenal centre-forward Ted Drake and according to McKinstry [...] "had the best game of his career to date." [...] Drake scored twice, but Ramsey still {{felt that he had}} proven his ability to play League football. On 3 March 1945, against Luton Town at the Dell, Ramsey was switched to inside-left because of injuries elsewhere in the team; he scored four goals in a 12–3 Southampton win. The Southern Daily Echo reported [...] "he <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> hammer a ball." [...] Ramsey finished the season having made 11 League South appearances.|$|E
500|$|All minorities, [...] or linguistic, can set {{up their}} own {{educational}} institutions to preserve and develop their own culture. In granting aid to institutions, the State cannot discriminate against any institution {{on the basis of the}} fact that it is administered by a minority institution. But the right to administer does not mean that the State cannot interfere in case of maladministration. In a precedent-setting judgement in 1980, the Supreme Court held that the State <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> take regulatory measures to promote the efficiency and excellence of educational standards. It can also issue guidelines for ensuring the security of the services of the teachers or other employees of the institution. In another landmark judgement delivered on 31 October 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that in case of aided minority institutions offering professional courses, admission could be only through a common entrance test conducted by State or a university. Even an unaided minority institution ought not to ignore the merit of the students for admission.|$|E
500|$|Periyar was {{generally}} regarded as a pragmatic propagandist who attacked the evils of religious influence on society, mainly what he regarded as Brahmin domination. At a young age, he felt that some people used religion only as a mask to deceive innocent people and considered it as his life's mission to warn people against superstitions and priests. Anita Diehl explains that Periyar cannot be called an atheist philosopher. Periyar, however, qualified for the definition of what the term 'atheist' implies in his address on philosophy. He repudiated the term as without real sense: [...] "…the talk of the atheist should be considered thoughtless and erroneous. The thing I call god... that makes all people equal and free, the god that does not stop free thinking and research, the god that does not ask for money, flattery and temples <b>can</b> <b>certainly</b> be an object of worship. For saying this much I have been called an atheist, a term that has no meaning". EVR Periyar, a born Hindu, was vehemently opposed to Hinduism and Christianity. He did not criticize Islam.|$|E
