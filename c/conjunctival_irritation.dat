5000|$|The {{toxicity}} of SWNHs {{is a critical}} issue relating to their biomedical application, which has been investigated in vitro and in vivo extensively. [...] The SWNHs {{were found to be}} a nonirritant and a nondermal sensitizer through skin primary and <b>conjunctival</b> <b>irritation</b> tests and skin sensitization test. Negative mutagenic and clastogenic potentials suggest that SWNHs are not carcinogenic. The acute peroral {{toxicity of}} SWNHs was found to be quite low—the lethal dosage for rats was more than 2000 mg/kg of body weight. Intratracheal instillation tests revealed that SWNHs rarely damaged rat lung tissue for a 90-day test period, although black pigmentation due to accumulated nanohorns was observed. While further toxicological assessments, including chronic (repeated dose), reproductive, and developmental toxicity studies, are still needed, yet the present results strongly suggest that as-grown SWNHs have low acute toxicities.|$|E
2500|$|Acetaldehyde is an {{irritant}} of the skin, eyes, mucous membranes, throat, {{and respiratory}} tract. This occurs at concentrations up to 1000 ppm. Symptoms {{of exposure to}} this compound include nausea, vomiting, and headache. These symptoms may not happen immediately. The perception threshold for acetaldehyde in air is in the range between 0.07 and 0.25 ppm. [...] At such concentrations, the fruity odor of acetaldehyde is apparent. <b>Conjunctival</b> <b>irritations</b> have been observed after a 15-minute exposure to concentrations of 25 and 50 ppm, but transient conjunctivitis and irritation of the respiratory tract have been reported after exposure to 200 ppm acetaldehyde for 15 minutes. It has a general narcotic action and large doses can even cause death by respiratory paralysis. It may also cause drowsiness, delirium, hallucinations, and loss of intelligence. Exposure may also cause severe damage to the mouth, throat, and stomach; accumulation of fluid in the lungs, chronic respiratory disease, kidney and liver damage, throat irritation, dizziness, reddening, and swelling of the skin.|$|R

5000|$|Neurotoxic {{shellfish}} poisoning (NSP) {{is caused}} by the consumption of shellfish contaminated by brevetoxins which are produced by the dinoflagellate, Karenia brevis. There are often both gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms of NSP includingdiarrhea, nausea/vomiting, numbness or tingling in lips face or extremities, disorientation, and partial paralysis.For public safety, NSP in shellfish is monitored by the State of Florida. There have been no new deaths attributed to NSP. Occasional new cases of NSP may occur when people consume unregulated shellfish species, when shellfish are illegally harvested, or when blooms expand to unmonitored geographic areas.There have been recent discoveries of Planktivorous finfish that retain the toxins in their muscles and organs,especially the liver. However, these toxins occur in finfish at much lower concentrations than shellfish [...] The toxins of K. brevis can also become aerosolized by surf, winds, or breaking waves. The inhalation of aerosolized K. brevis red-tide toxins may result in <b>conjunctival</b> <b>irritation,</b> runny nose, nonproductive cough, and wheezing. In healthy individuals, {{there seems to be a}} rapid reversal of these symptoms by leaving beach areas or entering an air-conditioned area. However, persons with severe asthma appear to be more susceptible to K brevis red-tide toxins. It has been shown that these individuals report a decrease in respiratory function after only 1 hour of exposure to a K brevis red-tide beach and these symptoms may last for days.|$|E

Methods: Six healthy New Zealand White rabbits were treated with either bimatoprost 0. 01 % or bimatoprost 0. 03 % (3 animals/group). One dose (2 drops/dose) of study medication was administered to the right eye of each animal every 30 minutes for 4. 5 hours. Approximately 1 hour after the last dose, <b>conjunctival</b> <b>irritation</b> was assessed using a slit-lamp biomicroscope to individually evaluate conjunctival congestion, swelling, and discharge. Results: The mean conjunctival congestion, swelling and discharge scores for bimatoprost 0. 03 % were 1. 67, 0. 33 and 0. 33, respectively, and for bimatoprost 0. 01 % were 2. 00, 0. 33 and 1. 33, respectively. Conclusions: Despite the lower drug concentration of the 0. 01 % formulation, bimatoprost 0. 01 % does not reduce <b>conjunctival</b> <b>irritation,</b> including conjunctival congestion, swelling, and discharge, in rabbits compared to bimatoprost 0. 03 %.

A 3 -year-old CF patient presented for evaluation with complaints of chronic periocular erythema, <b>conjunctival</b> injection, and <b>irritation</b> for 2 years. He was treated for presumed allergic conjunctivitis with no improvement and continued to have overall worsening of symptoms on the right greater than the left eye in a waxing and waning pattern. On presentation to the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, he was noted to have telecanthus and prominent erythema {{in the region of}} the medial canthus. Orbital imaging disclosed a mucocele in the right ethmoid sinus. The patient underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery, with successful marsupialization of the ethmoidal mucocele, which was found on culture to be infected with E. coli. Post-operatively with continuous pulmonary care, the patient remains free of allergic conjunctivitis and E. coli colonization of the upper airway.

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} triple fixed-combination bimatoprost 0. 01 %/brimonidine 0. 15 %/timolol 0. 5 % (TFC) versus dual fixed-combination brimonidine 0. 2 %/timolol 0. 5 % (DFC) in primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Methods. Patients with intraocular pressure (IOP) ≥ 23 and ≤ 34 [*]mmHg were randomized to twice-daily TFC or DFC. The primary variable is the change in worse eye mean IOP from baseline at week 12 (modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population). Secondary endpoints are mean IOP and mean change from baseline at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 (mITT population). TFC superiority was demonstrated if the primary variable favored TFC (p≤ 0. 05). Sensitivity analyses were conducted, and safety was assessed at all visits. Results. TFC (n= 93) provided greater IOP reductions from baseline than DFC (n= 97) at week 12 (treatment difference, 0. 85 [*]mmHg; p= 0. 028) and all other visits. TFC was also superior to DFC in patients with high baseline IOP (i. e., IOP[*]≥[*] 25 [*]mmHg; p≤ 0. 011). <b>Conjunctival</b> hyperemia, ocular <b>irritation,</b> and dry eye were reported more often with TFC (p≤ 0. 016); however, discontinuations for ocular adverse events were similar between treatments. Conclusions. TFC demonstrated IOP-lowering benefits that outweigh the risk of predominantly mild ocular side effects, which may be particularly relevant in patients who require greater IOP lowering to prevent/delay disease progression.

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} efficacies of punctal plug {{insertion}} and Botulinum toxin injection in dry eye disease not responding to topical medications. Materials and Methods: A non-controlled randomized clinical trial of two parallel groups of 60 dry eye patients {{seen in the}} clinic not responding to topical medications {{were divided into two}} groups. One group received punctal plugs and the other group received Botulinum toxin injections to prevent lacrimal tear drainage. Results: Of a total of 36 patients {{with a mean age of}} 44. 5 years who received punctal plugs, 50 % of them experienced improvements in the clinical manifestations of their disease. 12 / 36 (33. 3 %) developed plug extrusion, and 6 / 36 (16. 7 %) patients developed <b>conjunctival</b> erosions with <b>irritation</b> that necessitated plug removal within one week of insertion. A total of 24 patients with a mean age of 47. 5 years received injections of Botulinum toxin.

40|$|The {{vascular}} {{response in}} the forehead to stimulating the eye with soapy water was investigated in 15 subjects shortly after pharmacological blockade of the stellate ganglion.

Sympathetic blockade had no consistent effect on the vascular response, which was similar in magnitude on the blocked and sympathetically intact sides. In contrast, the electrodermal response was greater on the blocked side of the forehead, suggesting that sympathetic blockade had removed an inhibitory influence. The findings demonstrate that cervical sympathetic outflow does not increase vasodilatation or local sweating in the forehead during painful stimulation of the eye. <b>Conjunctival</b> <b>irritation</b> induces a trigeminal-parasympathetic vasodilator reflex in the forehead circulation.

40|$|Background. Aspirin-induced asthma (AIA) is {{characterized}} by onset of asthma attack 30 minutes to 3 hours after ingestion of aspirin or NSAIDs (Non steroid anti-inflammatory drugs). The typical reaction may be accompanied by intense rhinorhea, periorbital edema with <b>conjunctival</b> <b>irritation</b> and facial flushing. Often, at physical examination, nasal polyposis and serum eosinophilia are notable. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} is to identify the behavior of aspirin induced asthma in a certain group of Kosovo population, in terms of age and its presentation. Material and methods. At the University Hospital Centre in Prishtina, 172 adult patients with asthma were diagnosed, while 16 (9. 3 %) of them were with aspirin-induced asthma (f/m= 12 / 4). Results. The average age was 40. 2 years. Nine of them showed triad of symptoms (aspirin-intolerance, asthma, nasal polyposis) while 7 (43. 7 %) showed tetrad of symptoms (aspirin-intolerance, asthma, nasal polyposis, and sinusitis). Total IgE levels were increased only in 3 patients (18. 8 %), while eosinophilia was increased only in 8 (50 %) of the patients. The skin prick test with standard set of inhalant allergens was positive only in 3 patients (18. 8 %). There was no correlation between in vitro and in vivo tests. Conclusion. Since there is no reliable in vitro test for the diagnosis of aspirin sensitivity, definitive diagnosis requires an oral or nasal aspirin challenge, which needs to be performed in a hospital.

40|$|Objective: Allergic Rhinitis (AR) is an {{inflammatory}} disorder {{of the nasal}} mucosa characterized by nasal congestion, rhinorrhea and itching and often accompanied by sneezing and <b>conjunctival</b> <b>irritation.</b> Two prerequisites {{for the expression of}} AR are sensitivity to an allergen and its presence in the environment. Recognition of allergens and removal and avoidance of them can decrease the prevalence of AR. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of AR in Hamedan, Iran, and recognition of effective factors involved in expression of AR. Methods: The study was undertaken between October 2005 and June 2006 among 13 - to 14 -year-old children in middle-schools of Hamedan. Data were collected using the standardized ISAAC written questionnaire for prevalence of AR and another questionnaire for effective factors on AR including gender, season of expression of AR, smoking parents, keeping pets and birds, apartment plants, breast milking and family size. In the second phase the students with AR were examined for signs of AR. Findings: A total of 1600 (900 girls and 700 boys) children participated in the study. 17. 7 % of the children had symptoms of allergic rhinitis sometime in their life. There {{was no significant difference between}} prevalence of AR between boys and girls (18. 6 % in the boys and 17 % in the girls) (P> 0. 05). 37. 2 % of the cases were perennial and 62. 8 % of them were seasonal or mixed type. AR was more prevalent in spring (21 %). The prevalence of the disease between students with smoking parents and non smoking parents were 30. 6 % and 11. 2 % respectively (P 0. 05). The most common signs of AR were allergic shiners (54 %) and clear and dilute nasal secretion (51 %).
