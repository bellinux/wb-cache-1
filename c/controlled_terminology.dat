40|$|Computer-based {{systems that}} support health care require large <b>controlled</b> <b>terminologies</b> to manage names and {{meanings}} of data elements. These terminologies are not static, because change {{in health care}} is inevitable. To share data and applications in health care, we need standards not only for terminologies and concept representation, but also for representing change. To develop a principled approach to managing change, we analyze the requirements of <b>controlled</b> medical <b>terminologies</b> and consider features that frame knowledgerepresentation systems have to offer. Based on our analysis, we present a concept model, a set of change operations, and a change-documentation model that may be appropriate for <b>controlled</b> <b>terminologies</b> in health care.

5000|$|One {{criticism}} of the SDTM standards {{is that they are}} continually changing, with new versions released frequently. CDISC claims that SDTM standards are backward compatible.

New domains, for example the exposure as collected (EC) domain, were added recently. However, backward compatibility with earlier domains is not always possible.

40|$|AbstractA 1998 {{paper that}} {{delineated}} desirable characteristics, or desiderata for <b>controlled</b> medical <b>terminologies</b> attempted to summarize emerging consensus regarding structural issues of such terminologies. Among the Desiderata {{was a call}} for terminologies to be “concept oriented. ” Since then, research has trended toward the extension of terminologies into ontologies. A paper by Smith, entitled “From Concepts to Clinical Reality: An Essay on the Benchmarking of Biomedical Terminologies” urges a realist approach that seeks terminologies composed of universals, rather than concepts. The current paper addresses issues raised by Smith and attempts to extend the Desiderata, not away from concepts, but towards recognition that concepts and universals must both be embraced and can coexist peaceably in <b>controlled</b> <b>terminologies.</b> To that end, additional Desiderata are defined that deal with the purpose, rather than the structure, of <b>controlled</b> medical <b>terminologies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Metadata serves several purposes. It {{supports}} resource discovery, {{locates the}} actual digital resource by {{inclusion of a}} digital identifier, organizes electronic resources bringing similar resources together and distinguishing dissimilar resources, provides administrative information for controlling the digital library, and provides technical, preservation and rights man-agement information needed to support immediate and long-term permanent access. There {{are a variety of}} metadata schemes that serve different purposes for different object types, subjects and audiences. With disparate metadata schemes, ensuring that information collected in a specific scheme by one organization for a particular purpose can be exchanged, transferred or used by another organization for a different purpose becomes an issue. Metadata frameworks, crosswalks, and registries are ways to achieve interoperability. <b>Controlled</b> <b>terminologies</b> add more precise meaning to metadata. The integration of <b>controlled</b> <b>terminologies</b> and metadata schemes is key {{to the development of the}} Semantic Web. 1. The purpose of metadata Similar to traditional cataloging and indexing, metadata performs three main functions. It facilitates discovery of relevant information by describing aspects of the original electronic resource in which the designated user community may be interested. Metadata, such as titles, subject terms and abstracts or descriptions, are particularly important for electronic resources, such as datasets or photographs, that have little if any text content on which current text-based Web searching can be performed.

30|$|As soon as {{structured}} {{reporting is}} considered beyond {{the second level}} (consistent organisation) defined earlier (Definition section) codification using some <b>controlled</b> <b>terminology</b> is involved. The difficulty here arises from the very broad domain that must be covered, not limited to imaging procedures, techniques and semiology, but encompassing also clinical context, definition of diseases, syndromes, symptoms, and so on [13]. Moreover, {{there is also a}} legitimacy issue in terms of knowing which institution is best positioned to define some <b>controlled</b> <b>terminology.</b> In practice, these terminologies (e.g. SNOMED CT, LOINC, FMA, and so on) were defined by multiple organisations (IHTSDO, Regenstrief Institute with Indiana University, Washington University in Seattle, respectively), with significant overlaps in terms of scope. To remedy this situation, efforts such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) project, initiated by the National Library of Medicine in the US, managed to introduce mappings and concept unique identifiers (CUI), which allow relating common concepts across multiple terminologies [16]. Besides, the DICOM Standards Committee made a choice for SNOMED as its primary source of terminology and created its own terminology resource (named DICOM <b>Controlled</b> <b>Terminology)</b> when the needed terms cannot be found from existing resources. In parallel, new methods, tools and standards emerged from the cross-fertilisation of activities of the knowledge representation community with the world wide web, leading to the development of ontologies and other semantic web technologies. The radiological community understood very early the new possibilities that may arise with this technology, especially in terms of automated processing and reasoning. RSNA launched the RadLex project, which aimed at gathering a complete lexicon for radiology, made of terms borrowed from multiple terminological sources, but integrated into a common resource [17]. RadLex contains terms from multiple ontologies and is itself implemented in OWL (the Web Ontology Language) [18], but still suffers from several drawbacks that limit its possibilities in terms of reasoning and make maintenance somewhat cumbersome. This brief historical reminder highlights the main difficulties of designing terminological resources for radiology in general and structured reporting in particular. One of them is the difficulty in specifying the required level of expressivity, so that reliable reasoning can be implemented, which is needed at the minimum to be able to check the consistency of the terminology, and beyond, to ensure the reliable implementation of clinical decision models.|$|E
