500|$|On 15 July, the United States and Russia began two {{parallel}} military {{exercises in the}} Caucasus, though Russia denied that the identical timing was intentional. The joint US-Georgian exercise was called Immediate Response 2008 and also included servicemen from Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Armenia. A total of 1,630 servicemen, including 1,000 American troops, {{took part in the}} exercise, which concluded on 31 July. Counter-insurgency action was {{the focal point of the}} joint exercise. The Georgian brigade was trained to serve in Iraq. The Russian exercise was named Caucasus 2008 and units of the North Caucasus Military District, including the 58th Army, participated. The exercise included training to aid peacekeepers stationed in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. During exercises, a leaflet named [...] "Soldier! Know your probable enemy!" [...] was circulated among the Russian participants. The leaflet described the Georgian Armed Forces. Russian troops remained near the Georgian border after the end of their exercise on 2 August, instead of returning to their bases. Later, Dale Herspring, an expert on Russian military affairs at Kansas State University, described the Russian exercise as [...] "exactly what they executed in Georgia just a few weeks later [...] a <b>complete</b> <b>dress</b> rehearsal." ...|$|E
6000|$|As he spoke, {{the door}} flew open, and in entered, to the astonishment of Lord Glenvarloch, his late serving-man Richie Moniplies, now sumptuously, nay, gorgeously, attired in a superb brocaded suit, and leading {{in his hand}} the tall, thin, withered, {{somewhat}} distorted form of Martha Trapbois, arrayed in a <b>complete</b> <b>dress</b> of black velvet, which suited so strangely with the pallid and severe melancholy of her countenance, that the king himself exclaimed, in some perturbation, [...] "What the deil has the fallow brought us here? Body of our regal selves! it is a corpse that has run off with the mort-cloth!" ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a sight, however, {{before the}} gate, which perhaps would have afforded the first owner of Blenheim more {{pleasure}} than the finest {{view in the}} domain assigned {{to him by the}} gratitude of his country. This consisted of about a hundred Highlanders, in <b>complete</b> <b>dress</b> and arms; at sight of whom the Chieftain apologised to Waverley in a sort of negligent manner. 'He had forgot,' he said, 'that he had ordered a few of his clan out, for the purpose of seeing that they were in a fit condition to protect the country, and prevent such accidents as, he was sorry to learn, had befallen the Baron of Bradwardine. Before they were dismissed, perhaps Captain Waverley might choose to see them go through a part of their exercise.' ...|$|E

She is a very nice woman, and her {{daughter}} senior is I think beautiful and elegant, graceful, silly, fashionable and strange. We have a little tiff now and then--and she behaves a little better, or I must have sheered off.[86] I find by a sidelong report from your Mother that I am {{to be invited to}} Miss Millar's birthday dance. Shall I dance with Miss Waldegrave? Eh! I shall be obliged to shirk a good many there. I shall be the only Dandy there--and indeed I merely comply with the invitation that the party may not be entirely destitute of a specimen of that race.

6000|$|Otto, whose course {{hitherto}} {{had been}} undetermined, now immediately settled what to do. He straightway repaired to the ready-made emporium of Herr Moses, and bidding that gentleman furnish {{him with an}} archer's <b>complete</b> <b>dress,</b> Moses speedily selected a suit from his vast stock, which fitted the youth to a T, and we need not say was sold at an exceedingly moderate price. So attired (and bidding Herr Moses a cordial farewell), young Otto was a gorgeous, a noble, a soul-inspiring boy to gaze on. A coat and breeches of the most brilliant pea-green, ornamented with a profusion of brass buttons, and fitting him with exquisite tightness, showed off a figure unrivalled for slim symmetry. His feet were covered with peaked buskins of buff leather, and a belt round his slender waist, of the same material, held his knife, his tobacco-pipe and pouch, and his long shining dirk; which, though the adventurous youth had as yet only employed it to fashion wicket-bails, or to cut bread-and-cheese, he was now quite ready to use against the enemy. His personal attractions were enhanced by a neat white hat, flung carelessly and fearlessly {{on one side of}} his open smiling countenance; and his lovely hair, curling in ten thousand yellow ringlets, fell over his shoulder like golden epaulettes, and down his back as far as the waist-buttons of his coat. I warrant me, many a lovely Colnerinn looked after the handsome Childe with anxiety, and dreamed that night of Cupid under the guise of [...] "a bonny boy in green." ...|$|E
5000|$|Concurrently {{with the}} Georgia/USA {{military}} exercise Immediate Response 2008, the Russian forces conducted their own exercise, Caucasus 2008, where they practiced rapid {{response to the}} terrorist incursions through the Russian southern border. It was reported that the Russian paratroopers would train near the Roksky and Mamison passes. The Roksky pass is the major link with South Ossetia. Both sides claimed that the exercises were unrelated to each other. Later Dale Herspring, an expert on Russian military affairs at Kansas State University, described the Russian exercise as [...] "exactly what they executed in Georgia {{just a few weeks}} later ... a <b>complete</b> <b>dress</b> rehearsal." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{headscarf}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the hijab in both French and English) covers the hair, ears, neck, and sometimes the shoulders, but not the face. Most Muslim girls who cover their heads in school wear such a headscarf. More rarely, girls may also wear a <b>complete</b> <b>dress</b> covering their body (djelbab). The full or Afghan burka, which covers the entire body except for a slit or grille to see through, occurs more commonly as the dress of an adult woman than that of a schoolgirl. A recent controversy occurred when a mother who wore a full burka became a representative of parents in a city school. Rather than encourage public participation of such women, her participation in school deliberations while entirely covered was highly criticised. It was finally tolerated.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{all four}} nights of the concert, Siti wore {{at least three}} {{different}} traditional Malay dresses that were designed by four local designers - Cosry, Hatta Dolmat, Rizman Ruzaini and Zery Zamri. Her choice of dresses for the concert was praised by critics and reviewers. Both Kemalia Othman of mStar and Azhariah Kamin of The Star said Siti looked [...] "stunning" [...] and [...] "resplendent as ever" [...] {{during the course of}} the performance. For the opening sequence, she also wore a <b>complete</b> <b>dress</b> traditionally worn by Mak Yong performers, before donning one of the designed traditional dresses for her next song.While on stage, she was backed up by 40-piece Malaysian Traditional Orchestra conducted by Mohd Yazid Zakaria, and dancers and performers from Artistana Istana Budaya and Badan Seni Budaya Polis Diraja Malaysia (PDRM). The orchestra consisted of various musical instruments that are commonly used by the different ethnic groups in Malaysia, including Rebab, flute, Sapeh, percussion, Gaohu, Zhonghu, Er-hu, Dizi and Sitar. Apart from the orchestra and the backup performers, in one the performances, she was also backed by a group of Dikir Barat performers from Kumpulan Dikir Akademi Arjunasukma, led by a tukang karut (creative leader of a Dikir Barat group), Isey Fazlisham.|$|E
5000|$|May 1903 Urusov was {{appointed}} Governor of Bessarabia, whereafter he immediately purchased a guidebook of the area; {{he would go}} on to confess that he knew virtually nothing of the area, saying he 'knew as little of it ... as I did of New Zealand, or even less.' Despite viewing the appointment to this position in a distant corner of the Empire as a form of exile, he set off, after a short briefing with the Tsar in St. Petersburg, three weeks later by train to Bessarabian capital Kishinev from Moscow. The journey took two nights and three days, which Sergey spent in his private compartment studying his purchased guidebook to prepare himself for the meeting with the civic dignitaries, whom he expected to meet at arrival. Despite writing to his Vice-Governor requesting he keep the reception party small, Urusov was met by a crowd of people and an orchestral band at Bendery, the first major Bessarabian town; with a group of policemen cordening off the Vice-Governor in a <b>complete</b> <b>dress</b> uniform, alongside the city mayor with a platter of bread and salt, Urusov was greeted as Governors had traditionally been greeted in Bessarabia. One and a half hour later Urusov arrived at the administrative centre of Bessarabia: Kishinev; here he was driven round the city in an open carriage, with the sidewalks packed with bystanders who 'bowed, waved their handkerchiefs', with some even going down on their knees. A modest man, he admitted to being 'struck' by the matter, as he was not familiar with such displays of reverence. After a blessing in the Kishinev cathedral he arrived at the Governor's Residence, a palace in neo-classical style in the city centre.|$|E

5000|$|Mr and Mrs Barrington Jarramie are fashionable parvenus who are {{elevating}} {{themselves in}} society by the lever of politics. Daphne, their daughter, is secretly engaged to one Ernest Pepperton, an enthusiastic young Radical, who has incurred Mr Jarramie's dislike by his unorthodox politics. Mrs Jarramie is anxious {{about a very}} particular dinner which {{she is going to}} give that day. She has, by patience and diplomacy, secured a duchess as her guest, and Elie (Mrs Jarramie) condones her butler, Smithers's, pilfering of his choice imperial Tokay in order to keep him in good humour on the great occasion. A parcel arrives containing a present from Daphne's sailor cousin, an ancient lamp which he has sent as a bit of bric-a-brac. Daphne thoughtlessly runs out to get Smithers to clean the article, and that worthy soon appears and remonstrates with his mistress on the subject, winding up by giving [...] "notice." [...] It seems, however, that the real cause of the resignation is that Smithers has heard that Mr Jarramie is [...] "blackballed" [...] for the Cerulean Club, for which he had been put up. Mrs Jarramie loses her temper, and mentions the Tokay, and the butler spitefully leaves on the instant, taking his fiancée, the cook, with him. Mrs Jarramie is in despair but rubbing the lamp angrily, the room darkens, a vast cloud of smoke fills the air and Ben-Zoh-Leen, the Slave of Aladdin's Lamp, mysteriously appears. After mutual explanations, Mrs Jarramie engages him as cook and butler combined, for by his magic power he can change in a moment from one character to the other. In the twinkling of an eye he appears in the <b>complete</b> <b>dress</b> of a chef and goes about his business. Mr Jarramie comes down, and opens his letters. His Liverpool agents have sent him a combination safe, but have not forwarded the key word by which alone it can be opened. Finding the lamp in an escritoire, he dusts it, and the Genie appears from the kitchen. Mr Jarramie promptly engages him as an electioneering canvasser, and the Slave has to make a change to the orthodox frock-coat and high hat of a politician. Mrs Jarramie's jealousy, which has accidentally been aroused by her husband's late hours, is set aflame by the perusal of a telegram to him which she opens. She mistakes the wording [...] "Did you get safe in last night!" [...] and the female name which serves as a key-word to the safe, for a communication from a lady; and when she finds that Mr Jarramie has taken her chef away to use him as a canvasser, she orders Ben-Zoh-Leen to take her husband to - Timbuctoo. He does so; and then Pepperton explains to Mrs Jarramie the facts of her error. Horror! Mr Jarramie must be brought back. But Mrs Jarramie has carelessly put the lamp in the combination safe, and turned the handle. Ben-Zoh-Leen cannot conscientiously obey any one not [...] "holding" [...] the lamp, and Mr Jarramie is in an uncomfortable position, as the Genie amicably placed him {{in the midst of a}} tribe of natives of cannibalistic propensities. After a certain amount of agony Pepperton finds the letter containing the key-word, the lamp is recovered, and Mr Jarramie restored to the bosom of his family, Pepperton pardoned, and the Genie is given his freedom, and set up in an oil and lamp business, his last service being as a bald-headed and highly respectable butler, to serve up the dinner and announce [...] "The Duchess!" [...] on which happy termination the curtain drops.|$|E
