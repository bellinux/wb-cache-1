5|$|In 1906, {{the house}} had 16 {{bathrooms}} and 65 rooms, including 20 for servants. The house's main door opens into a square vaulted vestibule, walled throughout with highly polished yellow marble. It leads into the main hall, which is paneled to the ceiling in wood, painted white, the corners and angles accentuated by pilasters, and the rich mahogany doors encased within monumental frames. The white ceiling is intricately coffered. The hall has a large fireplace of carved white marble and a large table in the room's center, which was on a large red rug covering most of the floor. The main hall also featured Gobelins and Italian tapestries. The first floor also has an enfilade of three rooms: the green silk- and cedar-paneled living room, the white and gold drawing room, and the dark mahogany dining room. The three rooms have large doorways between them to allow hosts to combine rooms for a large event. The combined space has a span or linear distance of about 150 feet. A corridor connects the main hall to three rooms; it has recessed windows, dividing the corridor into bays. The corridor has pilasters and the same coffered ceiling of the main hall, and it used to have heavy velvet curtains at the window alcoves and entrance to the hallway; the windows had <b>curtains</b> <b>of</b> delicate salmon silk. The corridor originally displayed silk and velvet tapestries from {{various parts of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|The horseshoe-shaped {{auditorium}} with stalls, four {{tiers of}} boxes and a gallery (or loggione, i.e. the gods) is richly decorated with frescoes, stucco, gilding and velvet. The <b>curtains</b> <b>of</b> the royal box hang from a structure supported on stucco caryatids by Abbondio Sangiorgio who also designed the equestrian statue in Piazza Mazzini.|$|E
25|$|The {{green of}} the woman's dress symbolizes hope, {{possibly}} the hope of becoming a mother. Her white cap could signify purity, but probably signifies her being married. Behind the pair, the <b>curtains</b> <b>of</b> the marriage bed have been opened; the red curtains might allude to the physical act of love between the married couple.|$|E

25|$|In Exodus 25:18-22, Yahweh tells Moses to make {{multiple}} {{images of}} cherubim at specific points around the Ark of the Covenant. Many appearances {{of the words}} cherub and cherubim in the Bible refer to the gold cherubim images on the mercy seat of the Ark, as well as images on the <b>curtains</b> <b>of</b> the Tabernacle and in Solomon's Temple, including two measuring ten cubits high.|$|E
25|$|Originally the embrasures were {{fitted with}} mantlets or <b>curtains</b> <b>of</b> woven ropes; the rails {{on which they}} were {{supported}} can still be seen. These protected the guns and gunners from enemy fire and prevented sparks and smoke blowing back into the embrasures. As an additional safety measure, each cannon was isolated with a wet cloth hanging above it from a rope, to prevent the sparks from igniting the remaining gunpowder.|$|E
25|$|The Tabernacle {{during the}} Exodus, the {{wandering}} {{in the desert}} and the conquest of Canaan was in part a portable tent, and in part a wooden enclosure draped with ten <b>curtains,</b> <b>of</b> indigo (tekhelet תְּכֵלֶת), purple (argaman אַרְגָּמָן), and scarlet (shani שָׁנִי) fabric. It had a rectangular, perimeter fence of fabric, poles and staked cords. This rectangle was always erected when the Israelite tribes would camp, oriented to the east as the east side had no frames. In {{the center of this}} enclosure was a rectangular sanctuary draped with goat-hair curtains, with the roof made from rams' skins.|$|E

25|$|An {{extensive}} {{fire was}} considered unlikely {{because of a}} lack of flammable materials throughout the complex, other than packing materials in the rear. There were open spaces between rooms in place of doors to allow for easy access by forklift trucks. The only barriers were <b>curtains</b> <b>of</b> plastic strips between some to hold in refrigerated air. This allowed for rapid spread of smoke and heat in the deadly blaze. The building's previous use as an ice cream production facility meant that the walls and floor were hard, smooth surfaces, which limited the amount of material that was available to absorb heat and smoke during the fire.|$|E
25|$|The Teenbeat Club {{sponsored}} Battles of the Bands in 1966 and 1967. The 1966 Battle featured Scatter Blues, The Weeds, Present Tense and Nobody's Children, and was won by Scatter Blues in audience balloting. The 1967 Battle, between fourteen local bands (The Association of Sound, Blues Print, Calico Blues Band, <b>Curtains</b> <b>of</b> Grey, The Glass Door, Living End, The Moors, Nazz, The Neighborhood Kids, The New Breed, Nobody's Children, The Nomads, The Green Mountain Strawberry Patch, The Loved Ones, and The Wurds) was {{won by the}} Calico Blues Band, featuring guitarist Vaughn Thomas Munshower, organist Scott Devitte, bassist Mike Badik, vocalist Gary Meridith, {{and drummer}} Russell King. Munshower and Devitte later won Emmy Awards for Camerawork and Technical Lighting Direction, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The car is spartan, {{although}} it features inflatable lumbar support and adjustable seats. Along with {{the absence of}} exterior door handles, the vehicle lacks side windows and a roof. Although a soft top cover was available, it was designed primarily for indoor vehicle storage. Side <b>curtains</b> <b>of</b> fabric and clear plastic operated by zippers can be inserted into the door and hand-bolted when needed. All of these decisions were made to reduce weight. The battery {{is located in the}} sealed compartment over the rear wheels to increase rear-end weight and traction. The car shipped with a tonneau cover and video tape on soft-top assembly (the soft top is removable and folds to fit in the trunk). In 1994 the car came, {{for the first time since}} release with several options available to the buyer. These included air conditioning, adjustable suspension, larger diameter wheels to accommodate larger brakes, and a fiberglass hardtop for the roof.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese {{managed to}} repulse the Dutch attacks on two {{occasions}} but on the third attempt, the Dutch managed to obtain the upper hand. They concentrated their attacks on the bastion of Santiago which had a low small terrace. They hurled many fire darts and grenades which {{set fire to the}} barrels, cartridges and powder pots that were stored on the bastion. Most of the Portuguese defenders were burnt and rest retired wounded. A Portuguese sergeant major then sent the Dissave of Matara to the Retreat in order to bring more powder, munitions and fire pots to defend Santiago. Meanwhile, Captain Lourenço Ferreira tried to reinforce it twice with his patrol, but the fire caused by continuous Dutch grenade attacks forced them to retire on both occasions. On the third occasion Lourenço Ferreira was wounded by four bullets and fell to the ground with a broken arm and laid there incapacitated. With his loss, Ensign Major Valentim Pinheiro, a young boy, took over the command and resisted the Dutch attack. As their commanders sounded the retreat, recalling the third attack, the Dutch troops managed to enter the bastion of Santiago. The Dutch rapidly renewed the attack and manned the Portuguese artillery pieces which were on the terrace. Using them, the Dutch dislodged the defenders from the nearby <b>curtains</b> <b>of</b> the wall.|$|E
25|$|Old Ebbitt Grill reopened at 675 15th Street NW {{in early}} October 1983. Clyde's Restaurant Group spent $4.4 million {{constructing}} and outfitting the interior. The architectural firm of Andrews & Chatelain designed the interior. The interior decoration {{was designed to}} mimic the bar at 1427 F Street, and included the game trophies (some of which were originals, not recreations, and rumored to have been shot by President Theodore Roosevelt). Old Ebbitt's famous mahogany bar was not installed in the new location, however. A replica was crafted instead. The walls were paneled in mahogany and the ceilings decorated with murals and stencils. The restaurant had seating for 200 at tables and in booths. The booths had green leather seats and velvet-covered walls, and were separated from one another by etched glass dividers. The long bar still sported mounted game animal trophies overhead, the fixtures were of marble or brass, and the <b>curtains</b> <b>of</b> lace. An oyster bar {{was added to the}} rear of the restaurant on the main floor. The kitchen featured a special charcoal-burning grill, and the wine cellar featured a Cruvinet wine dispensing system. Gas lamps were used in the main bar and booth area. A year after the Grill opened, the Washington Post said it had the best dining ambience of any restaurant in the city.|$|E
500|$|Packard {{wrote that}} Beauty Revealed {{served as a}} sort of visual synecdoche, {{representing}} the entirety of Goodridge through her breasts. As opposed to the [...] "burdened" [...] 1845 self-portrait and the non-eroticized one of 1830, he found Beauty Revealed to forefront Goodridge and her demand for attention. Arguing that the clothing surrounding her breasts served to indicate a performance (similar to the <b>curtains</b> <b>of</b> vaudeville), Packard described the viewer's eyes being focused on the breasts, while the rest of Goodridge's body was erased and abstracted. This, he stated, challenged the assumptions and stereotypes regarding the demure, homebound 19th-century woman.|$|E

500|$|In another {{work on the}} North African campaign, the 1977 The Life and Death of the Africa Korps, Lewin {{wrote that}} it was [...] "necessary to assert that ... {{the purity of the}} desert {{purified}} the desert war", while Fraser focused on Rommel's battlefield performance and described him as a hero. Fraser's biography remains a work of high reputation, with Pier Paolo Battistelli praising it for the outstanding handling of the issue of Rommel's myth as well as his life and career in general. However, the work has been criticised by historian Mark Connelly as [...] "encapsulat the post-1945 hagiographic approach". Connelly offers the example of Fraser's description of Rommel as one of the [...] "great masters of manoeuvre in war", whose personality [...] "transcends time" [...] and [...] "cuts like [...] sabre through the <b>curtains</b> <b>of</b> history".|$|E
500|$|In {{the case}} of El Reno, the {{wrapping}} rain bands {{did not lead to}} a narrow corridor of clear air close to the tornado. Rather, these rotating <b>curtains</b> <b>of</b> rain were the outer circulation of the tornado itself. Former Discovery Channel storm chaser Tim Samaras (an engineer), his son Paul Samaras (a photographer), and Tim's longtime chase partner Carl Young (a meteorologist), all professional storm chasers with the TWISTEX project, were caught directly by the tornado; all three died in their vehicle, two of them were ejected. Normally, Tim drove a reinforced three-quarter ton truck optimized for hail protection and stability in high winds; however, on May31, Carl was driving an unmodified Chevrolet Cobalt, a subcompact vehicle with three 45-lb barometric probes in the trunk likened by one TWISTEX chaser to a [...] "pizza delivery car", making it much less suited to high winds and rain-slicked backcountry dirt roads. It was also underpowered, which hampered their escape in the strong inflow winds. Tim's body was found still buckled in the passenger's seat. They were the first known tornado-related deaths of either recreational storm chasers or scientific researchers.|$|E
500|$|Even {{though the}} woods in each cab were {{arranged}} in four basic patterns, all the elevator cabs used a unique combination of woods. One writer stated that [...] "if anything the building is based on patterned fabrics, [...] certainly are. Three of the designs could be characterized as having 'geometric', 'Mexican' and vaguely 'art nouveau' motifs, which reflect the various influences {{on the design of}} the entire building." [...] The roof of each elevator was covered with a metal plate whose design was unique to that cab, which in turn was placed on a polished wooden pattern that was also [...] customized to the cab. Hidden behind these plates were ceiling fans. Curcio writes that these elevators [...] "are among the most beautiful small enclosed spaces in New York, and {{it is fair to say}} that no one who has seen or been in them has forgotten them". Curcio also compares the elevators to the <b>curtains</b> <b>of</b> a Ziegfeld production, noting that each lobby contains lighting that peaks in the middle and slopes down on either side. The decoration of the cabs' interiors was also a nod to the Chrysler Corporation's vehicles: cars built during the building's early years had dashboards with wooden moldings. Both the doors and cab interiors were considered to be works of extraordinary marquetry.|$|E
