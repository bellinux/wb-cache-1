5|$|A central {{topic of}} Leontovych's work is choral music about {{everyday}} life. His music frequently reflect actual actions and events. An {{example of this}} is his shchedrivka “Ой там за горою” (Oh there behind the mountain) in which a tenor initially starts the song with a solo {{and the rest of the}} voices of the choir gradually come in, reflecting carolling when new groups of singers join in. Then, a switching of parts begins between different groups of the choir, recreating the <b>clamorous</b> atmosphere of the New Year's Eve.|$|E
25|$|No opera {{composed}} expressly for the Théâtre-Italien {{has had a}} more <b>clamorous</b> success. Four or five numbers repeated, callings-out of the singers, callings-out of the Maestro—in sum, one {{of those}} ovations.....which in Paris are reserved for the truly great.|$|E

25|$|But Rupert {{could not}} be in all places at once. Newcastle was <b>clamorous</b> for aid. In Lancashire, only the countess of Derby, in Lathom House, held out for the King. Her husband pressed Rupert {{to go to her}} relief. Once, too, the prince was ordered back to Oxford to furnish a {{travelling}} escort for the queen, who shortly after this, gave birth to her youngest child and returned to France. The order was countermanded within a few hours, it is true, but Charles had good reason for avoiding detachments from his own army.|$|E
25|$|Deerhoof {{began in}} San Francisco in 1994 as an improvisational bass/drums duo of Rob Fisk and Greg Saunier. Satomi Matsuzaki joined Deerhoof {{within a week}} of moving to the United States from Japan in May 1995, with no prior {{experience}} playing in a band, and went on tour as Deerhoof's singer only a week later, opening for Caroliner. Their 1997 debut album The Man, the King, the Girl, recorded on four-track cassette, balanced the wild, <b>clamorous</b> playing of Fisk and Saunier with Matsuzaki's Jingle-like melodies and colorful instrumentation, including toy instruments and broken Casios. The album art of a magical cow and a rabbit on a unicycle was drawn by Fisk. Many of Deerhoof's enduring traits were already in place: mythical lyrics; exaggerated, gestural playing style; low-budget DIY recording techniques; concept-album format; memorable melodic writing; and left-wing political stance.|$|E
25|$|Katherine Chidley about August last came to Stepney, (where shee hath drawn {{away some}} persons to Brownisme) and was with Mr. Greenhill, where shee {{with a great}} deal of {{violence}} and bitternesse spake against all Ministers and people that meet in our Churches, and in places where any idolatrous services have been performed: Mr. Greenhill answered her by Scripture, and laboured to reduce to a short head all she had spoke, asking her if this were not the sum, namely, that it was unlawfull to worship God in a place which had been used or set apart to Idolatry, under the Names of Saints and Angels; she would not hold to the stating of the question, but running out, Mr. Greenhill to convince her, told her that all England in this way and manner had been set apart to St. George, and Scotland to Saint Andrew, and so other Kingdomes to other Saints; so that by her grounds it was unlawfull to worship God in these, and so by consequence any where in the world; but instead of being satisfied or giving any answer, shee was so talkative and <b>clamorous,</b> wearying him with her words, that he was glad to goe away, and so left her.|$|E
25|$|A {{man who is}} {{born into}} a world already possessed, if he cannot get {{subsistence}} from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and if the society do not want his labour, has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is. At nature's mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be gone, and will quickly execute her own orders, {{if he does not}} work upon the compassion of some of her guests. If these guests get up and make room for him, other intruders immediately appear demanding the same favour. The report of a provision for all that come, fills the hall with numerous claimants. The order and harmony of the feast is disturbed, the plenty that before reigned is changed into scarcity; and the happiness of the guests is destroyed by the spectacle of misery and dependence in every part of the hall, and by the <b>clamorous</b> importunity of those, who are justly enraged at not finding the provision which they had been taught to expect. The guests learn too late their error, in counter-acting those strict orders to all intruders, issued by the great mistress of the feast, who, wishing that all guests should have plenty, and knowing she could not provide for unlimited numbers, humanely refused to admit fresh comers when her table was already full.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{understand}} why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than <b>clamorous</b> and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E
500|$|On October 20, James Power, {{one of the}} Irish empresarios who {{had helped}} to found San Patricio, learned that the Lipantitlán {{soldiers}} had been ordered to retake Presidio La Bahia. [...] Two hundred cavalry were expected to reinforce the Lipantitlán garrison before the attack, with an additional 200300soldiers expected later. [...] Although Dimmitt forwarded the intelligence to Austin, he was not given authorization to attack. [...] The delay proved costly to Williams and Toole, who were marched to the Mexican interior, {{beyond the reach of}} the Texians. [...] According to Dimmitt's angry letter to Austin, Toole begged his captors to kill him outright rather than send him on the march, which he believed would still result in his death. [...] Dimmitt concluded, [...] "this news, after the leniency shown to the prisoners taken here, could not fail to create a lively, and a strong excitement. [...] The men under my command are <b>clamorous</b> for retaliation".|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} film, remarking, [...] "It's <b>clamorous,</b> the save-the-world story is one everyone's seen time and again, and the characters {{have been around for}} more than half a century in 500 comic book issues. But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again." [...] To Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster. [...] "It's also the blockbuster," [...] Travers said, [...] "I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It's Transformers with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor." [...] Justin Chang of Variety wrote, [...] "Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times complimented the film's frenetic pace, while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times commented that it [...] "provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable". Conversely, A. O. Scott of The New York Times believed that [...] "while The Avengers is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre." ...|$|E

2500|$|Written as a {{commission}} from the Teatro Argentina in the [...] "beleaguered republic" [...] of Rome while the composer {{was still living}} in Paris, he traveled to Rome in late 1848 to prepare the opera for its first performance, which was given on 27 January 1849. Musicologist Roger Parker describes the première as [...] "a <b>clamorous</b> success, with the entire final act encored" [...] and the audience wild with enthusiasm. He goes to add that act 4 was encored at every performance of the run. However, we learn elsewhere that the opera failed in its 1850 production in Genoa.|$|E
2500|$|The New Zealand Company also {{established}} a settlement at Wanganui in 1840, chiefly as a spillover settlement, {{the site of}} the rural land promised to Wellington purchasers. A traveller in the colony at the time described Wanganui as [...] "one of the unwholesome, mushroom settlements engendered by the New Zealand Company for the purpose of removing to a distance a portion of the <b>clamorous</b> script-holders who, on arriving from England, looked, and looked in vain, for their land." [...] The Wanganui settlement was beset with problems when settlers arrived to find Māori on the land, denying it had been sold. [...] The company also sent surveyors down the east coast of the South Island to consider further sites, where they made contact at Akaroa with the fledgling French colony established there under the auspices of Jean-François Langlois's Nanto-Bordelaise Company.|$|E
2500|$|Josh Rosenblatt of The Austin Chronicle {{enjoyed the}} film, calling it [...] "good, manic fun plus a {{heavy dose of}} {{political}} intrigue adding up to two hours of <b>clamorous,</b> mind-numbing nonsense," [...] calling it [...] "The Transporter 2 on crack." [...] William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer also gave Eagle Eye a positive review, remarking that it's [...] "engrossing as an intellectual puzzle" [...] and [...] "a solid thriller." [...] Mark Bell of Film Threat said: [...] "the film isn't a complete waste of your time [...] but don't expect anything brilliant." [...] Neely Tucker of The Washington Post said that Eagle Eye is [...] "sometimes entertaining" [...] but [...] "doesn't have much to say." [...] Robert Koehler of Variety felt that the film's [...] "first 35 minutes sizzle" [...] but [...] "the story [...] near-parody in the final act." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stanton regrouped {{and began}} to focus on his cases by the summer. One such case was {{defending}} Caleb J. McNulty, whom Stanton had previously labelled [...] "a glorious fellow". McNulty, a Democrat, was dismissed from his clerkship of the United States House of Representatives by unanimous vote and charged with embezzlement when thousands of the House's money went missing. Democrats, fearing their party's disrepute, made <b>clamorous</b> cries for McNulty to be punished, and his conviction was viewed as a foregone conclusion. Stanton, at Tappan's request, came on as McNulty's defense. Stanton brought a motion to dismiss McNulty's indictment. He employed the use of numerous technicalities and, to the shock and applause of the courtroom, the motion was granted with all charges against McNulty dropped. As every detail of the affair was covered by newspapers around the country, Stanton's name was featured prominently nationwide.|$|E
2500|$|Austin's {{first order}} {{was that the}} men should be {{prepared}} to march at 9 am the following morning. [...] For the rest of the day, the men practiced firing and retreating in lines. Austin issued a string of orders, including barring men from indiscriminately firing their weapons and instructing them to keep their weapons in good repair at all times. [...] He also felt it necessary to, in his words [...] "remind each citizen soldier that patriotism and firmness will but little avail, without discipline and strict obedience. [...] The first duty of a soldier is obedience." [...] A later order instructed that [...] "All riotous conduct and noisy <b>clamorous</b> talk is specially prohibited". [...] Austin also organized elections for regimental officers. John H. Moore, who had led the Texians in the Battle of Gonzales, was elected colonel. [...] Edward Burleson, a former militia officer in Missouri and Tennessee, was named Lieutenant Colonel, and Brazoria merchant Alexander Somervell was elected Major.|$|E
2500|$|... 18. It {{is to be}} {{anticipated}} that perhaps not everyone will easily accept this particular teaching. There is too much <b>clamorous</b> outcry against {{the voice of the}} Church, and this is intensified by modern means of communication. But {{it comes as no surprise}} to the Church that she, no less than her divine Founder, is destined to be a [...] "sign of contradiction.") She does not, because of this, evade the duty imposed on her of proclaiming humbly but firmly the entire moral law, both natural and evangelical. Since the Church did not make either of these laws, she cannot be their arbiter—only their guardian and interpreter. It could never be right for her to declare lawful what is in fact unlawful, since that, by its very nature, is always opposed to the true good of man. In preserving intact the whole moral law of marriage, the Church is convinced that she is contributing to the creation of a truly human civilization. She urges man not to betray his personal responsibilities by putting all his faith in technical expedients. In this way she defends the dignity of husband and wife. This course of action shows that the Church, loyal to the example and teaching of the divine Savior, is sincere and unselfish in her regard for men whom she strives to help even now during this earthly pilgrimage [...] "to share God's life as sons of the living God, the Father of all men".|$|E
