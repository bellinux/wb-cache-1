To accomplish this task, both the signal at the bunching frequency of 2856 MHz and the signal at 2 2856 MHz are acquired and processed for each stripline. The positron beam position is obtained by forming a linear combination of both 2856 and 5712 MHz signals for each stripline and then performing the standard difference over sum computation.

Strictly, EV is not a measure of luminance or illuminance; rather, an EV corresponds to a luminance (or illuminance) for which a camera with a given ISO speed would use the indicated EV to obtain the nominally correct exposure. Nonetheless, it is common practice among photographic equipment manufacturers to express luminance in EV for ISO 100 speed, as when specifying metering range (Ray 2000, 318) or autofocus sensitivity. And the practice is long established; (Ray 2002, 592) cites Ulffers (1968) as an early example.

ATLAS has a large muon spectrometer {{which is designed to}} measure muon momentum with a resolution ranging from 3 % at 100 GeV/c to 10 % at 1 TeV for a pseudorapidity range of 0 - 2. 7. In this paper, we describe the derivation and validation of <b>calibration</b> <b>constants</b> for the Monitored Drift Tubes (MDTs) in the ATLAS muon spectrometer for use with initial LHC collisions. At LHC start-up, the luminosity was not sufficient for ordinary calibrations with collision muons, and so alternative methods were developed.

We have validated these <b>calibration</b> <b>constants</b> by performing muon track reconstruction using 900 GeV collision data from December, 2009 and 7 TeV data from 2010.

5000|$|The Evans balance {{measures}} susceptibility indirectly {{by referring}} to a calibration standard of known susceptibility. The most convenient compound for this purpose is mercury cobalt thiocyanate, HgCo(NCS)4, which has a susceptibility of 16.44×10−6 (±0.5%) CGS at 20 °C. Another common calibration standard is Ni(en)SO which has a susceptibility of 1.104 x 10−5 erg G−2 cm−3. Three readings of the meter are needed, of an empty tube, R0 of the tube filled with calibrant and of the tube filled with the sample, Rs. Some balances have an auto-tare feature that {{eliminates the need for}} the R0 measurement. Accuracy depends somewhat on homogenous packing of the sample. The first two provide a <b>calibration</b> <b>constant,</b> C. The mass susceptibility in grams is calculated aswhere L is the length of the sample, C is the <b>calibration</b> <b>constant</b> (usually 1 if it has been calibrated), and m is its mass in grams. The reading for the empty tube is needed because the tube glass is diamagnetic. There is a V term multiplied by an A term in the most general form of the equation. These two terms (V∗A) are colletively added to the numerator in the above equation. The V term is the volume susceptibility of air (0.029 x 10−6 erg G−2 [...] cm−3) and A is the cross-sectional area of the sample. These two terms can be ignored for solid samples, yielding the original equation written above.|$|E

The diaphragms are used to free-air chambers to fix the air volume of ionizing region in chambers. It means that absolute air-kerma rates are defined for collimated x-ray beams, because most of scattered photons are collimated by diaphragms. On the other hand, calibrated chambers are measured with non-collimated conditions. The variation of <b>calibration</b> <b>constants</b> was observed at different calibration distances and different diaphragm sizes for A 6 Exradion chambers calibrations.

40|$|The ATLAS Muon Spectrometer {{consists}} of 1200 precision MDT (Monitored Drift Tube) chambers containing 350, 000 pressurized drift tubes. To reach the muon detector design precision (Δp/p = 3 % at 100 GeV) for LHC physics, ATLAS established three muon calibration centers (in Italy, Germany, and United States). The original ATLAS muon calibration model uses muon tracks from LHC collision data {{to determine the}} <b>calibration</b> <b>constants</b> on a daily basis. However, ATLAS {{has been unable to}} use the original approach to determine the <b>calibration</b> <b>constants</b> due to an insufficient number of muon tracks in the initial beam collision data. What we have done instead is to use a gas monitor chamber to produce the drift tube response function (so-called RT function) and to use so-called “beam-splash” events to determine the MDT chamber readout time offset (T 0 s). The beam splash events are from a particle stream with very high intensity created by directing the LHC beam into collimators upstream of the detector. The resulting intense spray of particles illuminates the ATLAS muon spectrometer to nearly 100 % occupancy. The ATLAS calibration team developed sophisticated software to determine and validate muon calibrations from these “beam-splash” events. The presentation will show our calibration technique and validation results from the muon reconstruction of the initial beam data. The <b>calibration</b> <b>constants</b> obtained from beam splash events in 2 009 and in 2010 are consistent to ~ 2 ns for almost all the precision chambers.

5000|$|A few {{artifacts}} of APEX remain. Canon, Pentax and Leica cameras use 'Av' and 'Tv' to indicate relative aperture and shutter speed {{as well as}} to symbolize aperture priority and shutter priority modes. Some Pentax DSLRs even provide a 'TAv' exposure mode to automatically set the ISO speed depending on the desired aperture and shutter settings, and 'Sv' (for sensitivity priority) to pre-set the ISO speed and let the camera choose the other parameters. Some meters, such as Pentax spot meters, directly indicate the exposure value for ISO 100 film speed. For a given film speed, exposure value is directly related to luminance, although the relationship depends on the reflected-light meter <b>calibration</b> <b>constant</b> [...] Most photographic equipment manufacturers specify metering sensitivities in EV at ISO 100 speed (the uppercase 'V' is almost universal).|$|E
5000|$|For {{operation}} in either hc or pc mode, routine calibration in commercial instruments is usually accomplished with built-in electric heaters. The {{performance of the}} electrical heaters can in turn be validated using specimens of known heat capacity or which produce chemical reactions whose heat production per unit mass is known from thermodynamics (Wadsö and Goldberg 2001). In either hc or pc mode, the resulting signal is a computer-recordable voltage, calibrated to represent specimen μ W-range heat flow vs. time. Specifically, if no significant thermal gradients exist in the specimen, then P = eC U [...] t (dU/dt), where P is heat flow (i.e. μ W), εC is the <b>calibration</b> <b>constant,</b> U the measured potential difference across the thermopile, and t the time constant.

40|$|The {{collocation}} {{technique has}} become a popular tool in oceanography and hydrology for estimating the error variances of different data sources such as in-situ sensors, models and remote sensing products. It is also possible to determine <b>calibration</b> <b>constants</b> to account for e. g. an offset between the data sources. So far the temporal autocorrelation structure of the errors has not been studied, although {{it is known that}} it has detrimental effects on the results of the collocation technique, in particular when <b>calibration</b> <b>constants</b> are determined as well.

The coupling between the autocorrelation of the error and the estimation of <b>calibration</b> <b>constants</b> is studied in detail, due to its importance for analyzing temporal changes. In soil moisture applications, such time variations can e. g. be induced by seasonal changes in the vegetation cover, which affect both models and remote sensing products. The limitations of the proposed technique associated with these considerations are analyzed using remote sensing and in-situ soil moisture data. The variability of the inter-sensor calibration and the autocovariance are shown to be closely related to temporal patterns of the data. ...|$|R
