2500|$|Extensive arsenic {{contamination}} of groundwater {{has led to}} widespread arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh and neighboring countries. It is estimated that approximately 57million people in the Bengal basin are drinking groundwater with arsenic concentrations elevated above the World Health Organization's standard of 10 parts per billion (ppb). However, a study of cancer rates in Taiwan suggested that significant increases in cancer mortality appear only at levels above 150 ppb. The arsenic in the groundwater is of natural origin, and is released from the sediment into the groundwater, caused by the anoxic conditions of the subsurface. This groundwater was used after local and western NGOs and the Bangladeshi government undertook a massive shallow tube well drinking-water program {{in the late twentieth}} century. This program was designed to prevent drinking of bacteria-contaminated surface waters, but failed to test for arsenic in the groundwater. Many other countries and districts in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam and Cambodia, have geological environments that produce groundwater with a high arsenic content. [...] was reported in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand in 1987, and the Chao Phraya River probably contains high levels of naturally occurring dissolved arsenic without being a public health problem because much of the public uses bottled water. In Pakistan, more than 60 million people are exposed to arsenic polluted drinking water indicated by a recent report of Science (journal).

Tuna collected from SA exhibited higher <b>contamination</b> <b>levels</b> than those from RI, related to higher dietary inputs and higher total lipid content. Greater variability in <b>contamination</b> <b>levels</b> and profiles was identified in tuna from RI, explained by a higher diversity of prey and more individualistic foraging behaviour.

The concentrations, sources, <b>contamination</b> <b>levels,</b> sample collection and analytical tools of heavy metals in urban soils, urban road dusts and agricultural soils were widely compared and discussed in this study. The results indicate that nearly all the concentrations of Cr, Ni, Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Hg and Cd are higher than their background values of soil in China. Among the cities, the <b>contamination</b> <b>levels</b> of the heavy metals vary in a large range. The geoaccumulation index shows that the contamination of Cr, Ni, Cu, Pb.

40|$|Facemasks {{are part}} of the {{hierarchy}} of interventions used to reduce the transmission of respiratory pathogens by providing a barrier. Two types of facemasks used by healthcare workers are N 95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and surgical masks (SMs). These can become contaminated with respiratory pathogens during use, thus serving as potential sources for transmission. However, {{because of the lack of}} field studies, the hazard associated with pathogen-exposed facemasks is unknown. A mathematical model was used to calculate the potential influenza contamination of facemasks from aerosol sources in various exposure scenarios. The aerosol model was validated with data from previous laboratory studies using facemasks mounted on headforms in a simulated healthcare room. The model was then used to estimate facemask <b>contamination</b> <b>levels</b> in three scenarios generated with input parameters from the literature. A second model estimated facemask contamination from a cough. It was determined that <b>contamination</b> <b>levels</b> from a single cough (22 ̆ 0302 ̆c 619 viruses) were much less than likely levels from aerosols (4, 473 viruses on FFRs and 3, 476 viruses on SMs). For aerosol contamination, a range of input values from the literature resulted in wide variation in estimated facemask <b>contamination</b> <b>levels</b> (13 - 202, 549 viruses), depending on the values selected. Overall, these models and estimates for facemask <b>contamination</b> <b>levels</b> can be used to inform infection control practice and research related to the development of better facemasks, to characterize airborne <b>contamination</b> <b>levels,</b> and to assist in assessment of risk from reaerosolization and fomite transfer because of handling and reuse of contaminated facemasks.
