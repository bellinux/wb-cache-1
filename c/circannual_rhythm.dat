40|$|Life on Earth {{has evolved}} in a {{periodic}} world, which in most environments cycles predictably between {{conditions that are}} favourable or unfavourable for an organism. Organisms use favourable seasons to reproduce and grow, and withdraw during unfavourable seasons. To deal with the predictable changes in their environments, all taxonomic groups have evolved genetically programmed timing mechanisms. These govern seasonal cycles in physiology and behaviour that optimise survival and reproductive success, and have been formally described as <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythms.</b> Experimentally, under conditions of constant day length and temperature, <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythms</b> of many species continue to be expressed, even throughout the life cycle, illustrating the fundamental endogenous control. Under natural conditions, they are usually entrained by seasonal time cues, notably photoperiod, to synchronise the biology to environmental periodicity.

A similar pattern was evident in the rhythm of reproduction, which was phase-disrupted in pinealectomized squirrels but entrained in intacts. Seasonal changes in duration of nocturnal melatonin secretion by the pineal appear to be necessary to produce phase-delays required to entrain the circannual clock to a period of 12 months...|$|R

40|$|The varied {{carpet beetle}} Anthrenus verbasci L. has a circannual {{pupation}} rhythm and pupates {{in the spring}} in the wild. The change in photoperiod acts as a predominant zeitgeber for this rhythm. However, {{it is unclear whether}} the change in ambient temperature acts as a zeitgeber. The present study examines the effects of low-temperature pulses on this <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythm</b> by exposing larvae kept under constant short-day conditions (LD 12 : 12 h) at 20 °C to a lower temperature of 15, 10 or 5 °C for 8 or 12 weeks at various phases. Larval development and pupation are suppressed during exposure to low temperature, with this pupation being induced in sufficiently grown larvae within 2 months of a return to 20 °C. These results are attributed to the exogenous suppression and stimulation of pupation, rather than being related to the <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythm</b> (i. e. masking of the <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythm</b> by temperature). Furthermore, long-term observations demonstrate the existence of phase-dependent phase shifts of <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythm</b> as a result of low-temperature pulses.

40|$|Although <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythms</b> {{controlling}} different physiological {{processes and}} {{various aspects of}} behavior {{have been reported in}} numerous organisms, our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms is still quite limited. We examined the mechanisms controlling the <b>circannual</b> pupation <b>rhythm</b> of the varied carpet beetle, Anthrenus verbasci. This rhythm is self-sustainable, exhibits temperature compensation of the periodicity, and is entrainable to environmental changes. In addition, the circannual phase response curves to a photoperiod pulse display Type 0 or Type 1 resetting, depending on the duration of the pulse. Thus, we infer that this rhythm is derived from a self-sustaining biological oscillator with a period of about a year, i. e., a circannual clock, analogous to the circadian clock. Furthermore, a circadian clock appears to mediate photoperiodic time measurement for phase resetting of the circannual clock. Based on these results and previous research performed in other organisms, we discuss the general characteristics of the physiological mechanisms underpinning circannual rhythmicity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{efficacy}} of photoperiod as a zeitgeber for entrainment of circannual body weight and estrous rhythms was tested in female golden-mantled ground squirrels maintained for 3 {{or more years}} in either a simulated natural photoperiod (SNP) or a fixed LD 14 : 10 photoperiod (FP). The role of the retinohypothalamic tract&mdash;suprachiasmatic nucleus (RHT-SCN) projection in photic entrainment was assessed in animals that sustained destruction of the SCN (SCNx). <b>Circannual</b> <b>rhythms</b> were lengthened by the SNP {{as compared to the}} FP.

SCNx squirrels differed from animals with the SCN intact (SCN), as evidenced by higher within-group variability (p < 0. 001); only 29 % of SCNx squirrels had &tau;’s not different from 365 days (p < 0. 03 compared to the SCNc group). The coupling between estrous and body weight rhythms that was evident in SCN-intact SNP and FP squirrels was disrupted in SCNx animals.

40|$|The circannual {{pupation}} {{rhythm of}} Anthrenus verbasci is entrained to an environmental cycle {{by changes in}} photoperiod. Exposure of larvae reared under short-day conditions to long days induced a clear phase delay of the <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythm.</b> There was no notable difference in the initial phase or period of the <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythm</b> among four geographically distinct populations of A. verbasci in Japan: Takanabe (32. 1 °N), Osaka (34. 7 °N), Sendai (38. 3 °N), and Sapporo (43. 1 °N) populations. The range of photoperiodic changes effective for phase delay in the circannual pupation rhythm was compared among the four populations. Although larvae did not show a typical threshold response, but responded quantitatively to the photophase duration in intermediate conditions, the critical daylengths were calculated as those under which the pupation was delayed by 50 %: 12. 8 h in the Takanabe population, 13. 2 h in the Osaka population, and 13. 6 h in the Sendai and Sapporo populations. Thus, the critical daylength for entrainment of the <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythm</b> in A. verbasci was correlated to the habitat latitude, but the differences among the populations were much smaller than those reported in photoperiodism for induction of diapause in various insects. Consequently, {{the difference in the}} pupation time among the four geographic populations was very small under the natural photoperiod in Osaka at 20 °C, and absent under the natural photoperiod and temperature in Osaka.

40|$|Abstract Circannual rhythms are {{innately}} timed long-term (tau ≈ 12 months) {{cycles of}} physiology and behavior, crucial {{for life in}} habitats ranging from the equator to the Poles. Here the authors propose that <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythm</b> generation depends on tissue-autonomous, reiterated cycles of cell division, functional dif-ferentiation, and cell death. They see the feedback control influencing localized stem cell niches as crucial to this cyclical histogenesis hypothesis. Analogous to multi-oscillator circadian organization, <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythm</b> generation occurs in multiple tissues with hypothalamic and pituitary sites serving as central pace-makers. Signals including day length, nutrition, and social factors can synchro-nize circannual rhythms through hormonal influences, notably via the thyroid and glucocorticoid axes, which have profound effects on histogenesis.

40|$|Mammals {{and birds}} have evolved {{the ability to}} {{maintain}} a high and constant body temperature Tb {{over a wide range}} of ambient temperatures T a using endogenous heat production.

Since the occurrence of torpor in many species is a seasonal event and occurs at certain times of the day, we review whether circadian and <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythms,</b> important in the timing of biological events in active animals, also play an important role during torpor when Tb is reduced substantially and may even fall below 0 °C. The two distinct patterns of torpor, hibernation (prolonged torpor) and daily torpor, differ substantially in their interaction with the circadian system.

40|$|Phenology {{refers to}} the {{periodic}} appearance of life-cycle events and currently receives abundant attention as the effects of global change on phenology are so apparent. Phenology as a discipline observes these events and relates their annual variation to variation in climate. But phenology is also studied in other disciplines, each with their own perspective. Evolutionary ecologists study variation in seasonal timing and its fitness consequences, whereas chronobiologists emphasize the periodic nature of life-cycle stages and their underlying timing programmes (e. g. <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythms).</b> The (neuro-) endocrine processes underlying these life-cycle events are studied by physiologists {{and need to be}} linked to genes that are explored by molecular geneticists.

40|$|SummarySeasonal {{hibernation}} in mammals {{is under}} a unique adaptation system that protects organisms from various harmful events, such as lowering of body temperature (Tb), during hibernation. However, the precise factors controlling hibernation remain unknown. We have previously demonstrated a decrease in hibernation-specific protein (HP) complex {{in the blood of}} chipmunks during hibernation. Here, HP is identified as a candidate hormone for hibernation. In chipmunks kept in constant cold and darkness, HP is regulated by an individual free-running <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythm</b> that correlates with hibernation. The level of HP complex in the brain increases coincident with the onset of hibernation. Such HP regulation proceeds independently of Tb changes in constant warmth, and Tb decreases only when brain HP is increased in the cold.

To test this hypothesis, wheel-running activity and Tb were monitored for 12 to 14 months in castrated male ground squirrels housed in a 14 : 10 LD photocycle at 21 °C. Ani-mals were treated with testosterone implants that eliminated hibernation and prevented the marked winter decline in Tb; these squirrels manifested circannual changes in circadian entrainment indistinguishable from those of untreated ani-mals.

40|$|Seasonal {{variations}} in human serum levels of 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol (25 OHD) {{have been largely}} documented in transverse studies of population. But seasonality is not per se a demonstration that 25 OHD serum levels fluctuate along the course of year according to a waveform profile with a periodic rhythm. Because of this, we attempted to investigate the possible occurrence of a <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythm</b> for 25 OHD serum levels in a longitudinal design, by fitting a 365. 25 -day cosine curve to temporal biodata recorded in 10 clinically healthy subjects, monthly sampled for RIA determinations of 25 OHD.

With 95 % of probability, amplitude ranges from 5. 0 to 16. 5 ng/ml (mean value of oscillation = 10 ng/ml), while acrophase is temporally located from September 14 to December 3 (mean timing = October 21). Yearly, mean values for 25 OHD serum concentrations is of 40. 3 ± 5. 4 ng/ml as quantified by the line which transversely divides the cosine curve interpolating original biodata.

40|$|The present review {{discusses}} {{two types}} of biological rhythms, namely, circadian <b>rhythms</b> and <b>circannual</b> <b>rhythms.</b> Humans possess a circadian rhythm of approximately 24 hours, which is regulated by neural and hormonal processes.

Negative effects such as these may be partially alleviated by means of bright light during the night. During air travel across several time zones there is little time for the biological clock to adjust, but the resulting 'jet lag' may possibly be overcome by means of appropriately timed exposure to bright light. In countries situated far from the equator, the biological clock may become seriously disrupted during the short days of the dark season.

Pigeons were maintained indoors under constant ambient temperature (Ta) and simulated natural daylight (LD), 12 : 12 L:D regimens or outdoors exposed to seasonal variations in temperature and photoperiod at Oulu, Finland. Only slight changes of gonadotropins (LH, FSH) were observed throughout the year, without any clear photosensitive or photorefractory period.
