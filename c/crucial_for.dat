5|$|A {{critical}} {{issue is how}} to design protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival. Conservation efforts {{through the use of}} protected areas have shown to generally be a temporary solution to population decline and extinction because the amphibians become inbred.

They also generate the forces exerted by contracting muscles and play essential roles in intracellular transport.|$|E

In both stages of integration, the P. rebeli caterpillar is brought into the brood nest; however, in full integration, the P. rebeli also achieves its high social status within the host society. That status is <b>crucial</b> <b>for</b> surviving periods of host colony stress such as food shortage.|$|E

5|$|Ødegaard {{spent his}} first years in the local sports club Drammen Strong. His father, Hans Erik Ødegaard, a former {{football}}er, co-founded a football section in the club, and became the coach of his son's team. In 2005, when Ødegaard was six, his parents and others each invested 50,000 kroner so that the local club could refit their gravel field, Kjappen, with artificial turf. This has been cited as <b>crucial</b> <b>for</b> his development, as Ødegaard spent countless hours on the field.|$|E

5|$|At Stockach, the French {{concentrated}} {{their forces}} into shorter lines, creating intense fighting conditions; initially, Charles's line was more extended, {{but he quickly}} pulled additional troops from his reserves to strengthen his front. When a small French force commanded by Dominique Vandamme nearly flanked the Austrian Army, Charles's personal intervention was <b>crucial</b> <b>for</b> the Austrians, buying time for reinforcements to arrive. General Jourdan, while trying to rally his men, was nearly trampled to death. Ultimately, the French were driven back upon the Rhine River.|$|E
5|$|Democracy {{essentially}} means {{rule of the}} people. To build {{a democratic}} society and rule, there must be citizen participation by an informed electorate. The freedom to speak and express is thus <b>crucial</b> <b>for</b> the formation of public opinion on political questions, and is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. In Singapore, the right to {{freedom of speech and}} expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality, and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.|$|E
5|$|EFS regulates T-cell {{function}} and maturation, preventing expansion of autoreactive clones and pathological immune responses. Two {{studies that have}} reported that EFS expression in medullar thymus epithelial cells is important for negative selection of T-cells during their development, which implies an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and autoimmunity prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during embryogenesis but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is <b>crucial</b> <b>for</b> their functional maturation and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are important for proper T-cell maturation and negative selection of autoreactive clones, required for development of immunological self-tolerance.|$|E

5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics. He proposes that action {{should be based on}} communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is <b>crucial</b> <b>for</b> a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>crucial</b> <b>for</b> these {{definitions}} that {{edges are}} only {{allowed to stay}} within a single page of the book. As Atneosen already observed, if edges may instead pass from one page to another across {{the spine of the}} book, then every graph may be embedded into a three-page book. For such a three-page topological book embedding in which spine crossings are allowed, every graph can be embedded with at most a logarithmic number of spine crossings per edge, and some graphs need this many spine crossings.|$|E
5|$|On Cutler's {{touchdown}} pass to Jeffery, he tied Sid Luckman for the most {{touchdown pass}}es in Bears history with 137. Defensively, Pernell McPhee recorded his fifth sack during the game, and {{he became the first}} Bears player since Brian Urlacher in 2000 to have at least five sacks and one interception in the first seven games. During the second half, Matt Forte suffered a knee injury, and along with Eddie Royal, were missed the following week's game. The loss of Forte had been <b>crucial</b> <b>for</b> the Bears, as he had been responsible for 32 percent of yards gained in 2015, the most among running backs.|$|E

5|$|The Luftwaffe command {{understood}} that their support would be <b>crucial</b> <b>for</b> {{the success of}} Operation Citadel, but problems with supply shortfalls hampered their preparations. Partisan activity, particularly behind Army Group Center, slowed the rate of re-supply and cut short the Luftwaffe's ability to build up essential stockpiles of petrol, oil, lubricants, engines, munitions, and, unlike Red Army units there were no reserves of aircraft {{that could be used}} to replace damaged aircraft over the course of the operation. Fuel was the most significant limiting factor. To help build up supplies for the support of Citadel, the Luftwaffe greatly curtailed its operations during the last week of June. Despite this conservation of resources, the Luftwaffe did not have the resources to sustain an intensive air effort for more than a few days after the operation began.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} and docility of the dromedary make it popular as a domesticated animal. According to Richard Bulliet, {{they can be}} used {{for a wide variety of}} purposes: riding, transport, ploughing, trading and as a source of milk, meat, wool and leather. The main attraction of the dromedary for nomadic desert-dwellers is the wide variety of resources they provide, which are <b>crucial</b> <b>for</b> their survival. It is important for several Bedouin pastoralist tribes of northern Arabia, such as the Ruwallah, the Bani Sakhr and the Mutayr.|$|E
5|$|When Selvo {{approached}} the city, Guiscard's ships had already {{anchored in the}} harbor at Durazzo. Though the battle was fierce, superior tactics by the skilled Venetian fleet overpowered the inexperienced Normans who were mostly used to land battles. The battered fleet led by Guiscard retreated into the harbor after losing many ships. Victorious at sea, Selvo left the fleet {{under the command of}} his son and returned to Venice a hero. Because of the help given to the Byzantine Empire, the Republic of Venice was awarded a Golden Bull: a decree by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos granting Venice many privileges, including a tax exemption for Venetian merchants, that would be <b>crucial</b> <b>for</b> the future economic and political expansion of Venice in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
