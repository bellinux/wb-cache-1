25|$|Mine collapses (or mine subsidences) {{have the}} {{potential}} to produce major effects above ground, which are especially devastating in developed areas. German underground coal-mining (especially in North Rhine-Westphalia) has damaged thousands of houses, and the coal-mining industries have set aside large sums in funding for future subsidence damages as part of their insurance and state-subsidy schemes. In a particularly spectacular case in the German Saar region (another historical <b>coal-mining</b> <b>area),</b> a suspected mine collapse in 2008 created an earthquake measuring 4.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, causing some damage to houses. Previously, smaller earthquakes had become increasingly common and coal mining was temporarily suspended in the area.|$|E
50|$|Estrée-Blanche {{is found}} at the extreme edge of the <b>coal-mining</b> <b>area</b> of Nord-Pas-de-Calais. Part of its surface area was owned by the mining company, which ceased in the 1960s. All that remains of that era are some typical miners' houses.|$|E
50|$|The city {{became a}} major <b>coal-mining</b> <b>area</b> in the early 19th Century, {{contributing}} {{to the development of}} railways in the region as a means of transport. The first recorded coal mines in the central Ipswich area started at Woodend in 1848.|$|E
50|$|The route runs {{south-east}} to north-west {{through the}} northern East Midlands, largely through former <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas.</b> It runs largely {{parallel to the}} A616 road, around six miles further south.|$|R
5000|$|A singing hinny or singin' hinny {{is a type}} of bannock, griddle cake or scone, made in {{the north}} of England, {{especially}} Northumberland and the <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas</b> of the North East. [...] In Scotland, they are known as fatty cutties.|$|R
30|$|In {{this article}} we suggest and show that the GI concept is also {{applicable}} to post-mining cities and regions. Clearly, mining activities have significant long-term impacts on the environment, on ecosystem services as well as biodiversity (Wirth and Lintz 2007; Cao 2007). All too often such impacts are tremendously damaging to ecosystems. Consequently, our leading research questions are: How can the idea of GI be applied to meet the specific requirements of mining regions and post-mining landscapes? And what are {{the strengths of the}} GI concept in relation to landscape restoration in <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas?</b> We propose that the GI approach has a remarkable potential for the planning and management of former <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas</b> burdened with a legacy of subsidence, coal gangue dumps, old industrial facilities and brownfields.|$|R

50|$|By {{royal decree}} of 25 February 1823, MM. de Lur-Saluces {{and others were}} allowed, under {{the title of the}} {{railroad}} company, to establish a line from the Loire at Pont-de-l’Âne on the river Furens (or Furan, its modern name), to the <b>coal-mining</b> <b>area</b> of Saint-Étienne.|$|E
2500|$|Following World War II, France was {{in severe}} need of {{reconstruction}} and completely dependent on coal from Germany's main remaining <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas,</b> the Ruhr and the Saar. (The German coal fields in Upper Silesia had been {{handed over to}} Polish administration by the Allies in 1945, see Oder-Neisse line.) ...|$|R
50|$|Politics {{became a}} central issue for the coal miners, whose {{organisation}} was facilitated by their location in remote one-industry villages. The Miners' Federation of Great Britain formed in 1888, and counted 600,000 members in 1908. Much of the 'old left' of Labour politics can trace its origins to <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bantam units enlisted from {{industrial}} and <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas</b> where short stature {{was no sign}} of weakness. The name derives from the former town of Bantam in Indonesia, from which a breed of small domestic fowl allegedly originated. Bantamweight was a weight category in boxing that had originated in the 1880s and had produced many notable boxers.|$|R
50|$|The son of Polish immigrants, Henri Adamczewski {{was born}} in a <b>coal-mining</b> <b>area</b> of the North of France where he stayed until the age of 18. It was to this {{multilingual}} environment (Polish, Picard, French, Russian, German, Ukrainian and Italian) that he owed his passion for languages.|$|E
5000|$|The {{funicular}} was {{the first}} to be built in the UK since 1902. Its track and rolling stock was British-built by WGH Engineering of Old Edlington, who were in the <b>coal-mining</b> <b>area</b> near Doncaster and experienced in cable railways. It cost around £700,000 (£ in [...] money) to build.|$|E

50|$|The railway {{line from}} the {{northern}} exit of the Powder River Basin, {{one of the largest}} <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas</b> of the world, to Alliance and the eastern United States, sees a rather large number of coal trains every day, to power plants in the Midwest and South. In the southern areas of Alliance there is a large train yard which hosts many of these coal trains.|$|R
50|$|The road {{is mainly}} newly constructed, being built to {{regenerate}} the former <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas</b> of Barnsley {{in the late}} 1990s. It has many at-grade roundabouts, and no grade-separated junctions. It {{is not so much}} a through-route, but for local access. A lot of the road, often at junctions, looks half-finished. Most of it looks like a spine access road on a typical industrial estate.|$|R
50|$|The {{local area}} is {{historically}} a <b>coal-mining</b> <b>area</b> in the Mansfield district, with the closed Welbeck Colliery, one of Nottinghamshire's last surviving pits, nearby at Meden Vale. The school {{is next to}} the main A60 road and near the River Meden, with the Meden Sports Centre, which has a small swimming pool, integral to the site.|$|E
5000|$|Jewel and Esk Valley College {{was created}} in 1987 from the merger of Leith Nautical College ( [...] a former Central Institution [...] ) and Esk Valley College. In 2008 the Scottish Parliament {{approved}} the college name change to Jewel & Esk College. The Jewel part of the name refers to a former <b>coal-mining</b> <b>area</b> in the college's catchment area.|$|E

[...] It runs across Wallonia, passing from Dour, in Borinage, in the west, to Verviers in the east, through Mons, La Louvière, Charleroi, Namur, Huy, and Liège, following the valleys of the rivers Haine, Sambre, Meuse and Vesdre. It {{is also known}} as the [...] "Sambre and Meuse valley", or the [...] "Haine-Sambre-Meuse-Vesdre valley", or the [...] "dorsale wallonne." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{replacement}} of charcoal with coke in the steel-making process revolutionized the industry, and tied steelmaking to <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas.</b> In the 1800s, making {{a ton of}} steel required a greater weight of coal than iron ore. Therefore, it was more economical to locate closer to the coal mines. Pittsburgh, surrounded by large coal deposits and at the junction of three navigable rivers, was an ideal location for steelmaking.|$|R
50|$|As well {{as energy}} supply, coal became a very {{political}} issue, due to {{conditions under which}} colliers worked. Their dominance in remote villages heightened political and industrial solidarily, colliery owners. Much of the 'old Left' of British politics can trace its origins to <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas,</b> with the main labour union being the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, founded in 1888. The MFGB claimed 600,000 members in 1908. (The MFGB later became the more centralised National Union of Mineworkers).|$|R
50|$|The Bristol Coalfield is a geologically complex {{coalfield}} in {{the west}} of England. Comprising the coal-bearing rocks arranged around the Coalpit Heath Syncline and Kingsdown Anticline, it extends beneath the eastern {{parts of the city}} of Bristol and northwards through southern Gloucestershire. The coalfield is sometimes referred to together with the Somerset Coalfield, which lies to its south, as the Bristol and Somerset Coalfield. There are also two outlying <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas,</b> the Severn Coalfield and the Nailsea Basin which are described below.|$|R
50|$|He {{developed}} {{his staff and}} provided opportunities of women and minorities. Reporter Elizabeth Roberts Martin of Norman, Oklahoma, a 1966 graduate of Louisiana State University, was promoted as {{the first woman to}} hold editing positions in the Town Talk newsroom. LaBorde hired Cleo Joffrion, an Alexandria native, as the first African-American reporter at the paper. He promoted Cecil Williams, a native of the Kentucky <b>coal-mining</b> <b>area,</b> from assistant managing editor to business editor. Williams won numerous awards.|$|E
50|$|The region {{became famous}} {{during the period}} of its early industralisation in the 19th century. At that time Wupper Valley was a {{historical}} Silicon Valley. Its twin cities Barmen and Elberfeld were the trading- and industrial capitals of Prussia at that time. This economic upswing caused the expansion of the Ruhrgebiet as <b>coal-mining</b> <b>area</b> and gave birth to research on, and the theoretical underlining of social entrepreneurship and socialism: Friedrich Engels was born in Barmen to a textile mill owner.|$|E
50|$|The river gives {{its name}} to the town of Ammanford and the villages of Pontamman, Glanamman, Brynamman and Rhosamman. Garnant and Betws also lie in the Amman Valley - Garnant and Glanamman were {{formerly}} known as Cwmamman and it is now the name of their combined urban council. Garnant railway station was originally known as Amman Valley, the English version of Cwmamman. In the 19th and early 20th centuries the valley was a booming <b>coal-mining</b> <b>area,</b> but the mines have now closed.|$|E
5000|$|The Fuel and Lighting (Coal) Order 1941 {{came into}} force in January 1942. Central heating was {{prohibited}} [...] "in the summer months". Domestic coal was rationed to [...] {{for those in}} London and the south of England; [...] for the rest (the southern part of England having generally a milder climate). Some kinds of coal such as anthracite were not rationed, and in the <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas</b> were eagerly gathered {{as they were in}} the Great Depression (see The Road to Wigan Pier).|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} analyze the {{supporting}} role which GI could play in the transformation of <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas,</b> two contrasting case study regions were chosen: Zwickau–Lugau–Oelsnitz (Germany) and Xuzhou (China). These are suitable for analysis because: (1) Several research projects have already been conducted in these regions, producing {{a great deal of}} information; (2) the current authors were involved in research and planning tasks in these regions; and (3) the regions have already made some progress in restoration, allowing for a thorough assessment of the application of GI.|$|R
50|$|The need to {{maintain}} coal supplies (a primary energy source) had figured in both world wars.

50|$|In the {{highlands}} of southern Sakha Republic, the line crosses numerous further rivers, including the Iyengra and Chulman, {{before reaching the}} <b>coal-mining</b> <b>area</b> around Neryungri at around 400 km. The settlement of Berkakit, situated 9 km south of Neryungri, was founded in 1977 as the base for the railway's operations {{in the south of}} the Sakha Republic. Berkakit is the official starting point for the current project to construct the railway to Yakutsk (officially referred to as the Berkakit-Tommot-Yakutsk Line), and the majority of the town's workforce is employed either in management or maintenance of the railway.|$|E
50|$|Most 19th century {{residents}} of the area farmed for a living or, {{with the coming of}} the railroad, harvested timber. By the end of the century, Russellville and the surrounding area had become a prosperous <b>coal-mining</b> <b>area,</b> with the Quita Coal Company being the first established. Other coal companies followed with deep mine shafts sunk north and south of town, which, by the 1950s, had given way to strip mining. Cotton became a profitable crop near Russellville; in the early 20th century, bales were sold from wagons in the middle of Main Street. Today, no coal is mined, and the cotton gins are gone.|$|E

30|$|Haigh (2000) ascertained {{that high}} acidity and high {{concentration}} of aluminums in <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas</b> are often responsible for land degradation (loss of vegetation cover). Post-mining reclamation schemes are ultimately done to help degraded lands to be productive again; and this mainly involves re-establishment of vegetation cover. For successful post-mining landscape reclamation, sustainable practices such as management and replacement of top soil should be vital during moving and storage phases of excavation (Nova Scotia Environment 2009). This eventually provides the condition favorable {{for the establishment of}} a self-sustaining, succession-based vegetation cover through the application of native seed mixtures and plant materials (Nova Scotia Environment 2009).|$|R
30|$|Restoration {{plans for}} former <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas</b> {{should focus on}} {{upgrading}} areas of subsidence, mining heaps and brownfields to new (secondary) habitats and green areas, both as compensation for the lost (primary) pre-mining habitats and to create new potential for the successful post-mining development of the region. At {{the same time it}} is vital to develop methods of GI assessment for innovative post-mining concepts. Individual case studies such as Zwickau–Lugau–Oelsnitz, Germany, and Xuzhou, China, could serve as role models for this research, not just in these two countries but also at an international level. The GI concept can help foster the sustainable development of post-mining areas, providing a good quality of life and new perspectives for local people.|$|R
50|$|Although {{its first}} use was in <b>coal-mining</b> <b>areas,</b> Newcomen's engine {{was also used}} for pumping {{water out of the}} metal mines in his native West Country, such as the tin mines of Cornwall. By the time of his death, Newcomen and others had {{installed}} over a hundred of his engines, not only in the West Country and the Midlands but also in north Wales, near Newcastle and in Cumbria. Small numbers were built in other European countries, including in France, Belgium, Spain, and Hungary, also at Dannemora, Sweden. Evidence of the use of a Newcomen Steam Engine associated with early coal mines was found in 2010 in Midlothian, VA (site of some of the first coal mines in the US).(Dutton and Associates survey dated 24 November 2009).|$|R
