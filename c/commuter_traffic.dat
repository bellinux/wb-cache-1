5|$|As the E. C. Row Expressway was {{designed}} to serve <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic</b> in Windsor, and not province-wide movement, the route {{was transferred to the}} City of Windsor on April1, 1997.|$|E
5|$|Stanley also planned {{extensions}} of the existing Underground Group's lines into new, undeveloped districts beyond the central area to encourage {{the development of new}} suburbs and new <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic.</b> The first of the extensions, the Bakerloo line to Queen's Park and Watford Junction, opened between 1915 and 1917. The other expansion plans were postponed during World War I.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Strand Highway was {{constructed}} {{and open to}} the public by 1924. What would become SR75 was added to the state highway system in 1933, and designated Legislative Route 199 in 1935. SR75 was not officially designated until the 1964 state highway renumbering. The Coronado Bay Bridge opened in 1969, and provided a direct connection between San Diego and Coronado. Since then, various proposals have taken place to relieve <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic</b> between San Diego and Naval Air Station North Island that traverses the city of Coronado. However, none of these proposals have gained support, including an attempt in 2010.|$|E
50|$|A {{two lines}} is electrified, only for <b>commuter</b> EMU <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Wisconsin Central Railway {{runs through}} the village center. This is a heavily used freight line which also carries Metra <b>commuter</b> rail <b>traffic</b> from Antioch, Illinois to the Chicago Loop.|$|R
50|$|The N21 is {{also known}} as a notorious traffic {{bottleneck}} particularly in the County Limerick towns of Abbeyfeale, Newcastlewest and Adare. The towns (most notably Adare) feature regularly on morning and evening traffic reports where delays of up to 30 minutes can occur. Local <b>traffic,</b> <b>commuters</b> and tourist <b>traffic</b> all contribute to the congestion.|$|R
5|$|The nearby Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel {{is being}} planned to connect northeastern New Jersey and Long Island, with portals in Brooklyn and in Jersey City, New Jersey. The tunnel is being planned {{as a result}} of {{passenger}} and <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic</b> frequencies being at capacity and precluding freight movements. As early as the 1920s, this tunnel had been planned to cross the entire New York Harbor rather than just the Narrows. As a precursor to the planned project, which could cost up to $11 billion to build, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) compiled a Tier 1 Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in November 2014.|$|E
5|$|North Philadelphia {{continued}} to grow during the early 20th century as a popular residential area for the nouveau riche rejected by old money society. Two ballparks (the Baker Bowl and Shibe Park) were located nearby, as were new cultural institutions and automotive industry buildings. In 1928, the Broad Street Subway was opened with a station at North Philadelphia, offering more frequent service to Center City. Its northern entrances were located {{at the intersection of}} Glenwood Avenue and North Broad Street, with an underground passage offering an easy connection to the PRR station. The Reading Company replaced Huntingdon Avenue station with North Broad Street station, a massive Classical Revival structure rivaling the PRR station in grandeur. 30th Street Station opened in 1933, reducing North Philadelphia's importance for north-south services. However, North Philadelphia {{continued to}} serve heavy <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic</b> and east-west long-distance trains.|$|E
5|$|On December1, 2008, {{the bridge}} {{carrying}} NY270 over Tonawanda Creek (also the Erie Canal) {{was closed to}} traffic to allow construction to begin on a replacement bridge over the creek. The existing bridge was built in 1941 and considered to be structurally deficient. During construction, <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic</b> was detoured onto Tonawanda Creek and Bear Ridge Roads while trucks were instructed to follow NY263, NY78, and NY93 around the closed bridge. The new bridge was opened to traffic in July 2009. NY270's intersections with Tonawanda Creek Road (Erie CR2) and Tonawanda Creek Road North (Niagara CR60) on {{the north and south}} approaches to the bridge were reconstructed as part of the $10.9 million project. The new bridge is similar to the former, two-lane structure; however, unlike the old one, it has wide shoulders for bicyclists and includes new sidewalks for pedestrians.|$|E
5000|$|On 24 November 2013, a {{car bomb}} detonated outside a Victoria Square car park at 11.15pm. There were no injuries, {{although}} <b>commuters</b> faced <b>traffic</b> delays on 25 November as the security alert ended.|$|R
25|$|Smaller {{stations}} in the city including Beijing East Railway Station and Qinghuayuan Railway Station handle mainly <b>commuter</b> passenger <b>traffic.</b> The Fengtai Railway Station has been closed for renovation. In outlying suburbs and counties of Beijing, there are over 40 railway stations.|$|R
50|$|Many piers {{remained}} derelict {{for years}} until {{the demolition of}} the Embarcadero Freeway reopened the downtown waterfront, allowing for redevelopment. The centerpiece of the port, the Ferry Building, while still receiving <b>commuter</b> ferry <b>traffic,</b> has been restored and redeveloped as a gourmet marketplace.|$|R
25|$|In November 2016 the Phoenix Park tunnel was re-opened for <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic,</b> and {{services}} from Newbridge to Grand Canal Dock were introduced.|$|E
25|$|The {{urban area}} has a {{population}} of 7,864 (2006 census) and with improved road and rail since the mid-1980s, has developed significant student and worker <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic</b> with Cork city.|$|E
25|$|Pressure {{groups have}} {{advocated}} {{the protection of}} former routes, where the track has been lifted but the trackbed remains intact, to enable these to be reinstated for <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic</b> {{as an alternative to}} increased road building.|$|E
50|$|Traffic is {{a common}} problem, with many {{residents}} travelling to Montreal combined with Laurentians-Montreal <b>commuter</b> and cottage <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
50|$|Traffic is a {{big problem}} for the commune, since it is on a main road with Germany, and many <b>commuters</b> cause <b>traffic</b> jams in the morning. The traffic {{problems}} have been made worse by the provision of bus lanes, which have reduced the available space for automobiles.|$|R
50|$|The VR class Eil and Eilf are {{passenger}} cars used mainly during rush hour in Helsinki <b>commuter</b> rail <b>traffic.</b> The cars were built between 1982 and 1987 by VR Pasilan konepaja. The seating capacity is of 105 for Eil-class and 89 for Eilf-class cars. Maximum speed is 140 km/h.|$|R
25|$|About 190,000 {{people are}} {{employed}} in Linz, which is almost twice as many employed persons who live in Linz. Therefore, Linz {{has to deal with}} a lot of <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic.</b> At a workday around 100,000 employed persons commute to Linz and about 18,500 out of Linz.|$|E
25|$|Daily freight trains, {{operated}} by BNSF, {{run through the}} station often at night (usually 4 trains or more during the late hours) due to less <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic</b> at that time. The yard for the freight trains is approximately a few miles more south, near Petco Park and adjacent to the 12th & Imperial Transit Center.|$|E
25|$|The Taconic's {{character}} {{changes with}} its surroundings. In the busy suburbs {{of its first}} few miles, it is an arterial surface road, paralleling a commuter rail line through a small downtown. Soon after that it becomes a wide divided highway, with median strips and gentle turn radii similar to an Interstate Highway carrying much <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{as a case study}} using data collected over 5  years from 2004 to 2009 at a single WIM site south of Highway 2 A near the City of Leduc, Alberta, Canada. Functionally, the highway serves for both local and regional <b>commuter</b> <b>traffics</b> with approximately 7, 000 average annual daily traffic (AADT). The portion of truck traffic is about 8 % of the total traffic. The weather data for the study are obtained from Environment Canada’s Climate Database [17]. Environment Canada manages nearly 8, 000 weather stations across the country to collect climatologically data. Each of these weather stations provides detailed weather parameters such as maximum, minimum and mean temperature (measured in  °C, centigrade), total rain (millimeters), total snow (centimeters), total precipitation (millimeters) and the amount of snow on ground (centimeters) on a daily basis.|$|R
50|$|The {{terminus}} {{was moved}} from Traundorf to Seebahnhof in 1990. Today the historic railway carries {{a mix of}} <b>commuter</b> and tourist <b>traffic.</b> It is still operated by Stern und Hafferl Verkehr.|$|R
50|$|CommuteSmart is {{a program}} of the Regional Planning Commission of Greater Birmingham, Alabama, which works with {{employers}} and <b>commuters</b> to reduce <b>traffic</b> congestion and improve air quality in Jefferson and Shelby Counties.|$|R
25|$|The bridge {{highway is}} eight lanes wide. Three {{standard}} lanes, one emergency lane and one pedestrian lane serve each direction. On weekday mornings, most <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic</b> flows westbound to Europe, so {{four of the}} six lanes run westbound and only two eastbound. Conversely, on weekday evenings, four lanes are dedicated to eastbound traffic and two lanes, to westbound traffic.|$|E
25|$|The station {{experienced}} a renaissance during the 2000s. At {{that time the}} station started generating <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic</b> to Kristiansand. This traffic had increased greatly and now constitutes the bulk of traffic out of the station. Ridership was 2,400 annually in 2005, rising to 17,096 in 2010. Around then the Norwegian National Rail Administration carried out a cleaning of the station, renovating the station building, asphalting {{the parking lot and}} clearing out wild growth.|$|E
25|$|Reston {{experienced}} increasing {{traffic congestion}} as it {{grew in the}} late 1970s and early 1980s. This {{was a time when}} Reston's population was growing but the Dulles Toll Road had not been built. <b>Commuter</b> <b>traffic</b> between Reston and Washington created serious traffic congestion on the roads that connected Reston to Washington DC. In 1984 the toll road opened, and in 1986 the West Falls Church Washington Metro station opened. Most recently the Fairfax County Parkway, a major north-south artery, was opened.|$|E
50|$|Placing the <b>commuter</b> rail <b>traffic</b> into {{a tunnel}} {{of its own}} thus allows {{increased}} capacity for other national rail traffic through Central Station. The entire system for long-distance passenger railways in Sweden suffers from this bottleneck, since 80% of train rides in Sweden start or stop in Stockholm http://www.banverket.se/sv/Amnen/Aktuella-projekt/Projekt/1867/Citybanan-i-Stockholm/Nyheter/2008/Avtal-mellan-staten-och-regionerna-sakrar-Citybanans-finansiering.aspx. As a result, {{there is no room}} to increase the frequency of commuter, regional, and long-distance trains despite their heavy usage.|$|R
50|$|Queen Street is {{the main}} hub of the Valley Lines network - a railway system serving Cardiff, the Vale of Glamorgan, Bridgend and the South Wales Valleys - and has the solitary {{connection}} to Cardiff Bay. The station {{is located at the}} eastern end of the city centre, near the Capitol Centre as well as St David's Centre, and sees heavy volumes of <b>commuter</b> rail <b>traffic</b> during the rush hour.|$|R
50|$|Retiro {{is one of}} {{the largest}} hubs of {{transportation}} services in Argentina. Local and long distance rail service heading to the north originate from Estación Retiro (Retiro Terminal Station), and Retiro bus station is the city's main long-distance bus terminal. Subte line C of the Buenos Aires Metro system and numerous local public bus services serve Retiro, and this area is always teeming with <b>commuters</b> and <b>traffic</b> on weekdays.|$|R
25|$|From 1992 to 2011, the Atlantic Satellite Network (ASN) in Atlantic Canada, {{now known}} as CTV Two Atlantic, aired its own local version of BT. At {{the time of its}} launch, ASN and Citytv (Toronto) were both owned by CHUM Limited, and both {{channels}} had a similar overall movies-focused format. The Atlantic edition of BT was similar to the Toronto version, but with a greater emphasis on the culture of the region, as matters such as <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic</b> are typically less of a concern in Atlantic Canada.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, the Metropolitan Railway built {{a branch}} from its main line at Wembley Park to Stanmore. The line, {{as with many}} others in the {{northwest}} London area, was designed to absorb <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic</b> from the new and rapidly expanding suburbs. The line presented the Metropolitan with a problem – so successful was the suburban traffic that, by the early 1930s, the lines into Baker Street were becoming overloaded, a problem which was exacerbated by the post-war flight from the City of London to the West End of London.|$|E
25|$|Traffic jams {{are common}} in the city due to daily <b>commuter</b> <b>traffic</b> volumes, {{intercity}} traffic and excessive winter snow. The construction of freeways such as the Saint Petersburg Ring Road, completed in 2011, and the Western High-Speed Diameter, completed in 2017, helped partially reduce the traffic in the city. The controversial M11, {{also known as the}} Moscow-Saint Petersburg Motorway, would connect Saint Petersburg and Moscow by a freeway and is expected to be completed before the Russia FIFA World Cup 2018. Construction has started in 2010 and the first sections of the freeway was finished in 2014 and 2015.|$|E
50|$|Transportation demand {{management}} - Since 1975, DRCOG has offered Denver metro area residents commuting assistance. Beginning as a carpool matching service, DRCOG’s services now include carpool and vanpool matching, school carpool matching, teleworking assistance, and other alternative transportation {{programs to help}} <b>commuters</b> avoid <b>traffic</b> congestion and reduce pollution. In 2008, DRCOG won a creative excellence award from the Association for Commuter Transportation for a targeted telework business assistance program.|$|R
