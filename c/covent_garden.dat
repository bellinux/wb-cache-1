5|$|The <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> Estate {{was part}} of Beecham Estates and Pills Limited from 1924 to 1928, after which it was managed by a {{successor}} company called <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> Properties Company Limited, owned by the Beechams and other private investors. This new company sold some properties at <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden,</b> while becoming active in property investment {{in other parts of}} London. In 1962 the bulk of the remaining properties in the <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> area, including the market, were sold to the newly established government-owned <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> Authority for £3,925,000.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> {{area has}} long been {{associated}} with entertainment and shopping. <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> has 13 theatres, and over 60 pubs and bars, with most south of Long Acre, around the main shopping area of the old market. The Seven Dials area {{in the north of}} <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> was home to the punk rock club The Roxy in 1977, and the area remains focused on young people with its trendy mid-market retail outlets.|$|E

5|$|<b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> {{is served}} by the Piccadilly line at <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> tube station {{on the corner of}} Long Acre and James Street. The station was {{designed}} by Leslie Green and opened by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway on 11 April 1907, four months after services {{on the rest of the}} line began operating on 15 December 1906. The station is one of the few stations in Central London for which platform access is only by lift or stairs. Until improvements in 2007, due to high passenger numbers (16 million annually), entry to the station was sometimes restricted on busy days to reduce congestion on the platforms. The distance from <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> to Leicester Square at less than 300yards is London's shortest tube journey. Stations just outside the area include the Charing Cross tube station and Charing Cross railway station, Embankment tube station, Leicester Square tube station, and Holborn tube station. While there is only one bus route in <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> itself—the RV1, which uses Catherine Street as a terminus, just to the east of <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> square—there are over 30 routes which pass close by, mostly on the Strand or Kingsway.|$|E

5|$|Historically, the Bedford Estate {{defined the}} {{boundary}} of <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden,</b> with Drury Lane to the east, the Strand to the south, St Martin's Lane to the west, and Long Acre to the north. However, over time the area regarded as part of <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> has expanded northwards past Long Acre to High Holborn. Since 1971, {{with the creation of}} the <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> Conservation Area which incorporated part of the area between St Martin's Lane and Charing Cross Road, Charing Cross Road has sometimes been taken as its western boundary. Long Acre is the main thoroughfare, running north-east from St Martin's Lane to Drury Lane. Shelton Street, running parallel to the north of Long Acre, marks the London borough boundary between Camden and Westminster.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> {{estate was}} {{originally}} {{under the control}} of Westminster Abbey and lay in the parish of St Margaret. During a reorganisation in 1542 it was transferred to St Martin in the Fields, and then in 1645 a new parish was created, splitting governance of the estate between the parishes of St Paul <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> and St Martin, both still within the Liberty of Westminster. St Paul <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> was completely surrounded by the parish of St Martin in the Fields. It was grouped into the Strand District in 1855 when it came within the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Bow Street changed after {{the construction of}} the nearby <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> Theatre {{to the west of the}} street in 1809. Only a short run of buildings from No.35 to Russell Street remain on their original sites; the rest having been given up for large buildings. During the 19th century, Bow Street was a de facto extension of <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> and its associated markets, selling then-exotic fruit and vegetables.|$|E
5|$|Bow Street is a {{thoroughfare}} in <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden,</b> Westminster, London. It connects Long Acre, Russell Street and Wellington Street, and {{is part of}} a {{route from}} St Giles to Waterloo Bridge.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, traffic {{congestion}} was causing problems for the market, which required increasingly large lorries for deliveries and distribution. Redevelopment was considered, but protests from the <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> Community Association in 1973 prompted the Home Secretary, Robert Carr, to give dozens of buildings around the square listed-building status, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market relocated to its new site, New <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> Market, about three miles (5km) south-west at Nine Elms. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980, with cafes, pubs, small shops and a craft market called the Apple Market. Among the first shops to relocate here was Benjamin Pollock's Toy Shop. Another market, the Jubilee Market, is held in the Jubilee Hall {{on the south side of}} the square. The market halls and several other buildings in <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> have been owned by the property company Capital & Counties Properties (CapCo) since 2006.|$|E
5|$|Edward Hack {{developed}} {{the original idea}} and model of lemon juice being contained inside lemon-shaped and coloured packaging in the 1950s. The product was then designed and produced by Cascelloid Ltd. Hack presented Cascelloid with a fresh lemon he acquired at <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden,</b> upon which to base the plastic container. Hack had performed significant searches at several markets to find an optimal model. Cascelloid stated that Hack reviewed and evaluated the entire inventory of lemons at Fortnum and Mason’s, Selfridges, Harrods and <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden,</b> the latter of which involved examining three cases of lemons that contained around 300 lemons in each case.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 {{the parish}} {{became part of}} the County of London and in 1900 it {{became part of the}} Metropolitan Borough of Westminster. It was {{abolished}} as a civil parish in 1922. Since 1965 <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> falls within the London boroughs of Westminster and Camden, and is in the Parliamentary constituencies of Cities of London and Westminster and Holborn and St Pancras. For local council elections it falls within the St James's ward for Westminster, and the Holborn and <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> ward for Camden.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Solti {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} to be {{music director of the}} Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1962. Even before he took the post the Philharmonic's autocratic president, Dorothy Chandler, breached his contract by appointing a deputy music director without Solti's approval. Although he admired the chosen deputy, Zubin Mehta, Solti felt he could not have his authority undermined from the outset, and he withdrew from his appointment. He accepted an offer to become musical director of <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> Opera Company, London. When first sounded out about the post he had declined it. After 14 years of experience at Munich and Frankfurt he was uncertain that he wanted a third successive operatic post. Moreover, founded only 15 years earlier, the <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> company was not yet the equal of the best opera houses in Europe. Bruno Walter convinced Solti that it was his duty to take <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> on.|$|E

5|$|Street {{entertainment}} at <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> {{was noted}} in Samuel Pepys's diary in May 1662, when he recorded the first {{mention of a}} Punch and Judy show in Britain. Impromptu performances of song and swimming were given by local celebrity William Cussans in the eighteenth century. <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> is licensed for street entertainment, and performers audition for timetabled slots {{in a number of}} venues around the market, including the North Hall, West Piazza, and South Hall Courtyard. The courtyard space is dedicated to classical music only. There are street performances at <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> Market every day of the year, except Christmas Day. Shows run throughout the day and are about 30 minutes in length. In March 2008, the market owner, CapCo, proposed to reduce street performances to one 30-minute show each hour.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Opera is {{a company}} based in central London, {{resident}} at the Royal Opera House, <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden.</b> Along with the English National Opera, {{it is one of}} the two principal opera companies in London. Founded in 1946 as the <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> Opera Company, it was known by that title until 1968.

5|$|Among revivals in the 1950s and later, Hepokoski singles out as {{particularly}} notable the Glyndebourne productions with Fernando Corena and later Geraint Evans {{in the title}} role; three different stagings by Franco Zeffirelli, for the Holland Festival (1956), <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> (1961) and the Metropolitan Opera (1964); and Luchino Visconti's 1966 version in Vienna. A 1982 production by Ronald Eyre, more reflective and melancholy than usual, was staged in Los Angeles, London and Florence; Renato Bruson was Falstaff and Giulini conducted. Among more recent players of the title role Bryn Terfel has taken the part at <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> in 1999, in a production by Graham Vick, conducted by Bernard Haitink. and at the Metropolitan Opera in {{a revival of the}} Zeffirelli production, conducted by James Levine in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1790s, Grimaldi {{starred in}} a {{pantomime}} version of Robinson Crusoe, which confirmed his credentials as a key pantomime performer. Many productions followed, but his career at Drury Lane was becoming turbulent, and he left the theatre in 1806. In his new association with the <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> theatre, he appeared at {{the end of the}} same year in Thomas John Dibdin's Harlequin and Mother Goose; or, The Golden Egg, which included perhaps his best known portrayal of Clown. Grimaldi's residencies at <b>Covent</b> <b>Garden</b> and Sadler's Wells ran simultaneously, and he became known as London's leading Clown and comic entertainer, enjoying many successes at both theatres. His popularity in London led to a demand for him to appear in provincial theatres throughout England, where he commanded large fees.|$|E
