The use of a 3 x 6 ratiometric indicator-displacement assay (RIDA) array for the colorimetric detection and identification of ten anions in water is reported. The sensor array consists of different combinations of colorimetric indicators and metal cations. The colorimetric indicators chelate with metal cations, forming the color changes. Upon the addition of anions, anions compete with the indicator ligands according to solubility product constants (K-sp).

The color changes of the RIDA array were used as a digital representation of the array response and analyzed with standard statistical methods, including principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis.

The limit of detection was calculated approximately, and most limits of detections of anions are well below mu M level using our RIDA array.

PZ pretreatment inhibited {{the decrease in}} the survival rate of mice after LPS injection. PZ inhibited the increases in plasma NO as well as TNF-α after LPS.

Pretreatment of RAW 264 cells with PZ suppressed the production of NO and TNF-α after LPS addition. This inhibition likely resulted from the inhibitory effect of PZ on LPS-mediated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. Zinc sulfate, but not Car, suppressed NO production after LPS.
