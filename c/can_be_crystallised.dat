40|$|Surface-induced {{nucleation}} of carbamazepine (CBZ) in ethanol {{was investigated}} with different surface materials: glass, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and tin. The introduction of foreign surfaces with different areas and surface chemistries into the solution {{has an impact}} on the crystal morphology and polymorphic form (Form II or III). With an increase in supersaturation, a higher possibility of crystallisation of CBZ metastable Form II was observed, as expected. Increasing the number of inserts resulted in a direct increase in the surface area available for heterogeneous nucleation. The increase in surface area resulted in the greater possibility of obtaining the metastable Form II of CBZ. The stable Form III preferred to nucleate on tin rather than on glass and PTFE. The results indicate that the two different polymorphs of CBZ <b>can</b> <b>be</b> selectively <b>crystallised</b> out from solution {{with the aid of a}} foreign surface.

40|$|The {{densification}} and crystallisation {{of barium}} magnesium aluminosilicate (BMAS) glass powder {{has been investigated}} The aim {{of the study was}} to draw conclusions of value for the optimisation of the processing parameters for BMAS matrix ceramic composites. Pressureless sintering and hot-pressing techniques were investigated. The pressureless densification behaviour of cold-uniaxially pressed compacts was determined at isothermal and constant heating rate conditions using a high temperature microscope. The samples could be densified isothermally to full density at 930 degrees C prior to the onset of crystallisation. For compacts sintered at constant heating rates between 800 and 1100 degrees C, it was found that the simultaneous occurrence of crystallisation and densification strongly depends on the heating rate. Using hot-pressing (pressure = 20 MPa) results in full densification in the amorphous state after 1 hour at 925 degrees C. X-ray diffraction analysis was used to characterise the crystallinity of pressureless sintered and hot-pressed samples that were fabricated at temperatures between 850 degrees and 1300 degrees C. The crystallisation behaviour did not change, in qualitative terms, with the pressure applied during her-pressing. Combination of the densification and crystallisation results demonstrated that the BMAS glass <b>can</b> <b>be</b> densified completely at relatively low temperatures (930 degrees C) in the glassy state.

40|$|PURPOSE: Engineering of {{inhalation}} particles incorporating, in {{each individual}} particle, {{a combination of}} a long-acting beta-agonist and a glucocorticosteroid in a pre-determined and constant ratio for delivery via a dry powder inhaler (DPI). METHODS: Individual crystalline particles containing both the glucocorticosteroid fluticasone propionate (FP) and long-acting beta-agonist salmeterol (SX) were prepared, in a ratio of 10 : 1, using the solution atomization and crystallization by sonication (SAX) process. Combination drug particles were characterized by particle size, morphology, crystallinity and aerosolisation efficiency using inertial impaction. RESULTS: Combination drug particles were spherical and crystalline, with a median diameter of 4. 68 +/- 0. 01 microm.

40|$|International audienceCrystals of RANTES (regulated on {{activation}} normal T-cell expressed) {{have been}} {{grown in the}} presence of heparin-derived sulphated oligosaccharides which cause RANTES to aggregate severely. The crystals have a tendency to be polycrystalline but diffract to 3. 8 - 1. 8 A resolution. Oligosaccharides length and stoichiometry influence aggregation, nucleation and crystal growth and quality. Surprising, rather than inhibiting crystallisation, aggregation appears to stimulate nucleation. We have co-crystallised RANTES {{in the presence of}} oligosaccharides ranging in size from 1 to 12 sugar moieties. The best crystals, both according to size and diffraction quality have been obtained with a six moiety sugar. Crystals grow in the same space group with similar cell parameters as previously reported. We find no homogeneous binding of the sulphated sugars to RANTES even after eliminating sulphate from the crystallisation conditions to avoid competition with sulphates from the sulphated sugars. There is no electron density at the sulphate positions characterised in the original structure and the residues involved in sulphate binding adopt a different side chain orientation. Either heterogeneous binding of the sulphated sugars or an active ratchet-like mechanism by which the sulphated sugars are eliminated from the crystal lattice as the crystals grow may be responsible for the absence of sugars in the structure. The fact that aggregated proteins <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>crystallised</b> is important, since it is generally accepted that proteins that are polydisperse by light dynamic scattering are poor candidates for crystallisation trials...|$|E
