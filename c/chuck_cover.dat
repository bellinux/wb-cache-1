Serena's plans to study with Dan Humphrey for the SATs are cut short when Georgina persuades her {{to go out and}} have drinks to catch up with each other.

Serena reverts to her good girl persona however when she answers a call meant for Georgina that reveals she is still in contact with drug dealers and leaves, realizing that Georgina hasn't changed and that she missed her study date with Dan, which she and <b>Chuck</b> <b>cover</b> up with food poisoning. Serena apologises for the missed study plans and says she will meet Dan and Blair at the SATs the next day. Georgina calls her again, asking her to go to dinner with her. Serena declines the offer at first but Georgina assures that there won't be any wild partying and tells her how she has been {{inspired}} to turn her life around after seeing Serena the other day. Impressed, Serena meets Georgina for dinner, who compliments her on how much she's changed. When Serena gets up from the table to call Dan, Georgina drugs Serena's Diet Coke.

50|$|Generally {{regarded}} as the Faces' definitive statement, {{this is the most}} balanced album of the group's career in terms of songwriting and of mood, thanks largely to the decision to share production duties with Glyn Johns. Johns' judicious production decisions here ensure that not a single one of the nine tracks on the album outstays its welcome. The album also features two very sensitively-sequenced ballads and an endearingly ramshackle <b>Chuck</b> Berry <b>cover</b> among its cast of bluesy rockers and rollicking bar-room swing-alongs. Bassist Ronnie Lane, often left frustrated by the division of vocal duties in the band, gets to sing lead on three of his own contributions (one co-written with Keyboardist Ian McLagan), including the moving examination of father-son relationships, 'Debris'.|$|R
