5000|$|In Europe (but {{not most}} other PAL areas), SCART {{connectors}} are typically used, which can carry composite and analog RGB interlaced video signals (RGB can be progressive, {{but not all}} DVD players and displays support this mode) or Y/C (S-Video), as well as analog two-channel sound and automatic 4:3 or 16:9 (widescreen) switching on a single convenient multi-wire cable. The analog RGB <b>component</b> <b>signal</b> offers video quality which is superior to S-Video and identical to YPbPr component video. However, analog RGB and S-Video signals can not be carried simultaneously, due to each using the same pins for different uses, and displays often must be manually configured as to the input signal, since no switching mode exists for S-Video. (A switching mode does exist to indicate whether composite or RGB is being used.) Some DVD players and set-top boxes offer YPbPr component video signals over the wires in the SCART connector intended for RGB, though this violates the official specification and manual configuration is again necessary. (Hypothetically, unlike RGB component, YPbPr component signals and S-Video Y/C signals could both be sent over the wire simultaneously, since they share the luminance (Y) component.) ...|$|E

The network also amplifies the tuned <b>component</b> (<b>signal)</b> by two mechanisms: First, by modulating the embedded gain through adjusting the operating point of the network, and second, by recurrently mixing presynaptic selectivities and thereby amplifying weakly tuned inputs in some neurons.|$|E
