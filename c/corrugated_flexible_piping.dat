The worse outcome of these assumptions and simplifications could be that estimated values of loss coefficients are too small or too large (if still assuming, the trend of k’s as function of Re and flow ratio Q s /Q c [...] remains the same as shown in Figures[*] 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). Therefore, a sensitivity analysis is performed, where the loss coefficients at the junctions are varied over a certain range to see their effect on the estimated flow distribution. For that purpose, isothermal flow distribution for M[*]=[*] 78 kg/m 2 h based on junction loss coefficients (kdiv,st, kdiv,s, kcom,st, and kcom,s) given by Equations 11, 15, 16, and 17 is used as the reference, and the influence of increasing or decreasing the loss coefficients for straight (kdiv,st and kcom,st) and side flow (kdiv,s and kcom,s) is examined.

40|$|Abstract: New {{measurements}} of the frictional pressure drop of air–water two-phase flow in a <b>flexible</b> <b>corrugated</b> U-tube have been carried out. Experiments were performed under the following conditions of two-phase parameters: mass flux of 300 – 800 kg/m 2 s, gas quality of 1 – 60 per cent, and system pressure of 3 – 7 bar. The inner diameter of the U-tubes tested was 40 mm, with a ratio of curvature radius to inner diameter varying from 3 to 7. 5. The results demonstrate that the two-phase flow resistance, energy dissipation, friction losses, and interaction of the two phases in <b>flexible</b> <b>corrugated</b> U-tubes are perceptible about two to five times greater than those in smooth U-tubes. Hence, the two-phase friction factor of such tubes increases from 0. 65 to 1. 4, depending on the influencing flow and geometrical parameters. The available correlations in the open literature present a similar trend and behaviour. However, they predict the data presented poorly because of the complex geometry of the <b>flexible</b> <b>corrugated</b> U-tube. Based on the energy balance and the presented experimental results, a new model has been developed to calculate the frictional two-phase pressure drop and hence the friction factor of the flexible U-tube. The model includes the relevant primary parameter, fits the experimental data well, and is sufficiently accurate for engineering purposes. The standard deviation of the data is less than 7 per cent.

Elastic analysis of structures requires that very specific conditions at all points within the structure and on its boundary are satisfied.

It {{has become an}} al-most irreplaceable important component part in industrial applications such as vibration isolator, sealing system, <b>flexible</b> <b>piping</b> or structural bearing. During the service, these components are subjected to fluctuating mechan-ical loading. Under cyclic loading conditions, rubber exhibits strong inelastic responses such as stress-softening due to Mullins effect. It is believed that such inelastic response plays major {{role in determining the}} durability in service of rubber component. In engineering applications where the components are concurrently exposed to aggressive solvent, further material degradation in the form of swelling occurs. Thus, it is essential to inves-tigate the effect of swelling on the stress-softening due to Mullins effect in rubber like materials for durability analysis. In this study, the Mullins effect in swollen carbon black-filled natural rubber under cyclic loading con-ditions is investigated. The swollen rubbers are obtained by immersing initially dry rubber in solvent at room temperature for various immersion durations. The stress-strain responses for both dry and swollen rubber are found qualitatively similar. However, the stress-softening in swollen rubbers are notably lower compared to that in the dry one.

In order for branch pipes, flex-loops or other jumper type configurations to cope with the functional, fabrication and installation loads they {{are designed to}} be highly flexible. Depending on well conditions and functional requirements the piping is commonly highly utilised statically. Vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) and wave-induced loading on the other hand are directly related to the Eigen-frequencies of the piping systems, and the more flexible a system is, the more prone it is to respond to cyclic loading induced by waves and current. In order to mitigate environmental loading effects, it is favourable to heighten the harmonic frequency of a system. Increasing the harmonic frequency is however done by making the system more rigid, which generally is undesirable for <b>flexible</b> large-bore <b>piping</b> systems in manifolds, since this in turn increases the level of static utilisation. There is to DNV’s knowledge currently no standard industry practice on VIV and environmental loading for large-bore manifold piping, since these normally are sufficiently rigid to prevent VIV.

Due to this construction, they respond very well to bending and they are cheaper and much easier to install than metal pipes. Because of the specific construction, the pipe walls are corrugated and the fabric which covers the steel spiral is much rougher than {{the wall of a}} metal pipe. In this investigation we are interested in estimating the friction factor for the flow in this type of pipes. Two-equation turbulence models (k -?? and k -!) are used in the computations. The process of deriving these models is presented first. Then we look at turbulent boundary layers and the law of the wall which gives the velocity profile near the wall. Its use as a boundary condition is explained. After the theoretical ideas have been exposed, we look at fully developed turbulent flow in a conventional pipe. Simulations are performed to validate the chosen models, boundary conditions and computational grids. Then a new boundary condition is implemented based on the 2 ̆ 2 combined 2 ̆ 2 law of the wall.
