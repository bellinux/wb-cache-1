50|$|The {{levels of}} PtdIns5P change {{significantly}} {{in response to}} physiological and pathological stimuli. Insulin, thrombin, T-cell activation, and cell transformation with nucleophosmin anaplastic lymphoma tyrosine kinase (NPM-ALK), <b>cause</b> <b>elevation</b> of cellular PtdIns5P levels. In contrast, hypoosmotic shock and histamine treatment decrease the levels of PtdIns5P. In T-cells, two “downstream of tyrosine kinase” proteins DOK1 and DOK2 are proposed as PtdIns5P-binding proteins and effectors.|$|E

25|$|The {{coronary}} artery {{that has been}} occluded can be identified in an ST-elevation myocardial infarction based on the location of ST elevation. The LAD supplies the anterior wall of the heart, and therefore <b>causes</b> ST <b>elevations</b> in anterior leads (V1 and V2). The LCx supplies the lateral aspect {{of the heart and}} therefore <b>causes</b> ST <b>elevations</b> in lateral leads (I, aVL and V6). The RCA usually supplies the inferior aspect of the heart, and therefore <b>causes</b> ST <b>elevations</b> in inferior leads (II, III and aVF).|$|R
50|$|Intraparenchymal {{hemorrhage}} {{accounts for}} approx. 8-13% of all strokes and {{results from a}} wide spectrum of disorders. It is more likely to result in death or major disability than ischemic stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage, and therefore constitutes an immediate medical emergency. Intracerebral hemorrhages and accompanying edema may disrupt or compress adjacent brain tissue, leading to neurological dysfunction. Substantial displacement of brain parenchyma may <b>cause</b> <b>elevation</b> of intracranial pressure (ICP) and potentially fatal herniation syndromes.|$|E
50|$|Treatment with steroids is {{lengthy and}} usually {{requires}} about 6 months. While some source report very good success with steroids most report a considerable risk of recurrence after a treatment with steroids alone. Steroids {{are known to}} <b>cause</b> <b>elevation</b> of prolactin levels and increase risk of {{several conditions such as}} diabetes, and other endocrinopathies which in turn increase the risk of IGM. Treatment with topical steroids to limit side effects was also reported in one case. For surgical treatment recurrence rates of 5-50% have been reported.|$|E
50|$|Mild {{hypokalemia}} {{is often}} without symptoms, {{although it may}} <b>cause</b> <b>elevation</b> of blood pressure, and can provoke {{the development of an}} abnormal heart rhythm. Severe hypokalemia, with serum potassium concentrations of 2.5-3 meq/l (Nl: 3.5-5.0 meq/l), may cause muscle weakness, myalgia, tremor, and muscle cramps (owing to disturbed function of skeletal muscle), and constipation (from disturbed function of smooth muscle). With more severe hypokalemia, flaccid paralysis and hyporeflexia may result. Reports exist of rhabdomyolysis occurring with profound hypokalemia with serum potassium levels less than 2 meq/l. Respiratory depression from severe impairment of skeletal muscle function is found in many patients.|$|E

40|$|SummaryIt is {{well known}} that statins may <b>cause</b> <b>elevation</b> of liver enzymes, but the {{association}} of statins with hepatitis B reactivation has never been reported before. A case of hepatitis B reactivation induced by atorvastatin is reported herein. Atorvastatin not only caused significant increases in aminotransferases, but also caused ongoing viral replication by evidence of a several-log increase in hepatitis B virus. The reactivation recovered spontaneously by discontinuation of atorvastatin. The evolving concept of a double-edged sword with regard to statins in patients with hepatitis B is discussed...|$|E

50|$|Glare, {{particularly}} from the front sight, can be a significant problem with iron sights. The glare from the front sight can increase the apparent brightness of the light bar {{on one side of}} the sight, causing windage errors in aiming, or lower the apparent height of the front sight, <b>causing</b> <b>elevation</b> errors in aiming. Since the direction of the ambient light is rarely constant for a shooter, the resulting changing glare can significantly affect the point of aim.|$|R
40|$|A {{patient with}} esophageal rupture and {{elevated}} pleural fluid amylase activity mimicking acute pancreatitis was studied {{to find the}} origin of the enzyme. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic patterns suggested that saliva was the source of elevation in this disorder.

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleThe so called “big-big ” prolactin (Prl), also known as macroprolactin is formed by Prl-immunoglobulin (Prl-IgG) complexes and may <b>cause</b> <b>elevation</b> of serum Prl concentrations measured by standard assays, potentially leading to unnecessary investigations and/or treatment [1]. The term “macroprolactinaemia ” is typically applied 60 % of total serum Prl concentration [2]. It is well proved that autoimmune thyroid disease is often associated with other autoimmune conditions. For instance pituitary antibodies can be observed in about 20 % of cases of autoimmune thyroid disease [3]. Further-more, autoimmune thyroid disease, and Hashimoto thyr-oiditis in particular, increases the likelihood of fertility problems and/or menstrual irregularities [4, 5].

50|$|The encoded 22 kDa protein {{contains}} an N-terminal secretion signal and two coiled-coil domains {{and is a}} member of the angiopoietin-like (ANGPTL) protein family. However, in contrast to other ANGPTL proteins, betatrophin lacks the C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain, and therefore it is an atypical member of the ANGPTL family. It shares with Angptl4 and Angptl3 the ability to inhibit the enzyme Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and its hepatic overexpression <b>causes</b> <b>elevation</b> of circulating Triglyceride levels in mice. In mice betatrophin is secreted by the liver.|$|R

40|$|Prion {{disease or}} {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies are neurodegenerative disorders of humans and other mammals. They are fatal and difficult to diagnose. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} some prion diseases <b>cause</b> <b>elevation</b> of manganese in the blood and brain. In the current study we analysed blood and brain samples from humans to determine whether elevation in manganese is a specific characteristic of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, {{the most common form of}} human prion disease. Analysis of manganese in the blood of normal humans showed that concentrations vary little with age or sex. Analysis of other diseases, including other neurodegenerative disease showed that only CJD showed an elevation in manganese and copper. Other diseases that showed elevated manganese included blood-brain barrier disorders and haemochromatosis. However, CJD could be easily distinguished from these diseases. This implies that increased blood manganese in prion disease is a highly specific characteristic of the disease...|$|E
