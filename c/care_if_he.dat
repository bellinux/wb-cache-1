5|$|On Christmas Day, Archie tells Ian the CD of the {{recording}} is under Ian's Christmas tree for Jane, but Ian fails to find it. Archie tells Janine that they should skip Christmas dinner as {{he has made a}} surprise treasure hunt for her. Janine eventually finds an envelope containing a one-way ticket to Poland and Archie throws her out onto the street telling her he knows how she and Ryan tried to double-cross him. Archie is visited by Jack who threatens to kill him if he hurts Ronnie again. Archie finds Ian searching his living room for the CD and Archie says it is on his laptop and he can make copies at any time, threatening Ian with a phone call to Jane, before ejecting him from the pub. Sam returns and attempts to confront Archie but he shuts the door on her. Ronnie then arrives and tells him with no emotion that he will not make her care for him and she would not <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> died. Archie throws her out onto the street reminding her that it was the exact spot she pushed Danielle onto the night she died.|$|E
500|$|In Super Bowl XL in February 2006, the Steelers faced a tough test in slowing Seattle Seahawks All-Pro {{running back}} Shaun Alexander {{who ran for}} 1,880 yards and scored an NFL record 28 touchdowns {{in the regular season}} behind an {{offensive}} line that featured All-Pro linemen Walter Jones and Steve Hutchinson on the left side. [...] The defensive line would need to slow down the Seahawks running attack to keep the Steelers in the game, a challenge which Mitchell took personally. [...] The players came through holding Alexander under the 100-yard plateau and most importantly preventing him from scoring, which was crucial to a Steelers win. [...] After the game, Mitchell said of the strategy, [...] "Our thing was 'keep him out of the end zone.' We [...] didn't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> got 300 yards; don't let him in the end zone." ...|$|E
500|$|A similar, {{although}} more indepth, {{story of the}} recruitment of Gholston has been told by Wilcher: [...] "He {{was walking down the}} hall with a Bible in his hands," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "He was already built like a grown man; he was all cut up (like a bodybuilder). I asked him, 'Can I help you sir?' He looked around to see who I was talking to. I said, 'Are you looking for a student?' He said, 'No, I go here.' He said he was a freshman. I thought he was lying." [...] When the defensive coordinator kicked Gholston off the team for being too soft, Wilcher went to his house and dragged him back into the program: [...] "I told him I didn't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wasn't tough enough, he was going to play football for me," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "I knew that he had desire to play. My only regret is that I didn't put him at running back. I didn't know how fast he was." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{official}} {{justification for}} the rerouting was that the trains would serve more remote communities, but the concentration of ridings held by the Progressive Conservatives along the CN route attracted the charge that the move was chiefly political. [...] Harvie André, one of Alberta's federal cabinet ministers who represented Calgary, stated publicly {{that he did not}} <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> never saw a passenger train again in his life.|$|E
2500|$|George Bush {{was widely}} seen as a [...] "pragmatic caretaker" [...] {{president}} who lacked a unified and compelling long-term theme in his efforts. Indeed, Bush's sound bite where he refers {{to the issue of}} overarching purpose as [...] "the vision thing" [...] has become a metonym applied to other political figures accused of similar difficulties. [...] "He does not say why he wants to be there", wrote columnist George Will, [...] "so the public does not know why it should <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> gets his way".|$|E
2500|$|Mötley Crüe {{was formed}} on January 17, 1981 when bassist Nikki Sixx left the band London and began rehearsing with drummer Tommy Lee and vocalist/guitarist Greg Leon. Lee had worked {{previously}} with Leon {{in a band}} called Suite 19 and the trio practiced together for some time with Leon eventually deciding not to continue. Sixx and Lee then began a search for new members and soon met guitarist Bob Deal, better known as Mick Mars, after answering an advertisement that Mars placed inside The Recycler that read: [...] "Loud, rude and aggressive guitar player available". Mars auditioned for Sixx and Lee and was subsequently hired. Although a lead vocalist named O'Dean was auditioned, Lee had known Vince Neil from their high school days at Charter Oak High School in Covina, California and the two had performed in different bands on the garage band circuit. Upon seeing Neil perform with the band Rock Candy at the Starwood in West Hollywood, Mars suggested they have him join the band by stating, [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> can sing. I don't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> can do anything. The way he had that crowd going...THAT'S the guy we need." [...] At first Neil refused the offer, but as {{the other members of}} Rock Candy became involved in outside projects, Neil grew anxious to try something else. When Lee made one final appeal to audition, Neil accepted and was hired April 1, 1981.|$|E

2500|$|In April 1985, a Canadian {{familiar}} with blasting {{was asked by}} Reyat how much dynamite {{it would take to}} blow up a tree stump. Reyat was not shy about telling everyone he knew around Duncan about the need for revenge, or asking about explosives. Reyat sought cases of dynamite and did not <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had to pay three times the normal price. He eventually confided it was not about stumps, but [...] "trouble in the old country", that he needed [...] "explosives to help my countrymen." [...] One friend declined to get him dynamite, but did lend him a 400-page manual on mining with explosives.|$|E
2500|$|As Smithsonian {{magazine}} stated, [...] "Violent confrontations were {{a recurring}} theme in Cobb's life." [...] He {{is thought to have}} committed several violent assaults during his playing time. [...] Reported victims of his sudden uncontrollable rages through the years included a black groundskeeper who attempted to shake Cobb's hand, along with his wife, though this story (see above) is now considered dubious at best; as well as a handicapped fan. [...] As he attacked the handicapped man, [...] "someone screamed for Cobb to stop, pointing out that the man had no hands. [...] 'I don't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has no feet!' Cobb yelled back, stomping [...] until park police pulled him off." [...] Cobb reported in his autobiography that the handicapped man incurred Cobb's ire by speaking on his mother's [...] "color and morals." ...|$|E

Knuckles was also revealed to have a mystically significant destiny as [...] "the Avatar," [...] corresponding to similar destinies shared by Tails and Sonic.

2500|$|On {{the fifth}} anniversary of Columbine, the FBI's lead Columbine {{investigator}} and several psychiatrists published their conclusions in a news article. These conclusions stated Harris was a clinical psychopath, whereas Klebold was depressive. Harris had been the mastermind, having a messianic-level superiority complex, and had hoped to demonstrate his superiority to the world, whereas Klebold, having repeatedly documented his desires to commit suicide in his diaries—particularly due to his lack of success with women—had primarily participated in the massacre as a means to simply end his life. Dr. Dwayne Fuselier, the supervisor in charge of the Columbine investigation, would later remark: [...] "I believe Eric went to the school to kill and didn't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> died, while Dylan wanted to die and didn't care if others died as well." [...] Klebold's final remark in the videotape he and Harris made shortly before their attack upon Columbine High School is a resigned statement made as he glances away from the camera: [...] "Just know I'm going to a better place. I didn't like life too much." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 15, 1912, Cobb {{assaulted}} a heckler, Claude Lucker (often misspelled as Lueker), in {{the stands}} in New York's Hilltop Park where his Tigers were playing the Highlanders (now the Yankees). Lucker and Cobb had traded insults with {{each other through the}} first couple of innings. Cobb at one point went to the Highlander dugout to look for the Highlander's owner to try to have Lucker ejected from the game, but his search was in vain. The situation finally climaxed when Lucker allegedly called Cobb a [...] "half-nigger." [...] Cobb, in his discussion of the incident in the Holmes biography, avoided such explicit words but alluded to Lucker's epithet by saying he was [...] "reflecting on my mother's color and morals." [...] He went on to state that he warned Highlander manager Harry Wolverton that if something wasn't done about that man, there would be trouble. No action was taken. At the end of the sixth inning, after being challenged by teammates Sam Crawford and Jim Delahanty to do something about it, Cobb climbed into the stands and attacked Lucker, who it turned out was handicapped (he had lost all of one hand and three fingers on his other hand in an industrial accident). When onlookers shouted at him to stop because the man had no hands, he reportedly retorted, [...] "I don't <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> got no feet!" [...] Though such an incident seems outrageous in the 21st century, attacking fans was not so unusual an activity {{in the early years of}} baseball. Other notable baseball stars who assaulted heckling fans include Babe Ruth, Cy Young, Rube Waddell, Kid Gleason, Sherry Magee, and Fred Clarke.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2011, Silas tells Lynsey {{that he is}} {{planning}} to murder again and that she has until midnight on Halloween to identify his next victim. He promises Lynsey that if she works out who his next victim is he will confess his crimes to the police, but if she fails another girl will die. Lynsey has {{to go along with}} Silas's mind game after everyone still refuses to believe her claims about him. Hassan explained that Silas does not <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> gets caught or perishes in the process. He reminds Lynsey of his plan by sending her clues and presents, such as a chess queen and a pumpkin containing the message [...] "Tick tock, time is running out". Lynsey confides in Doug and tells him what Silas is doing. Silas picks out four potential victims: Lynsey, Texas, Theresa and Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies). He then marks each one of them with chess pieces which are planted in their homes or bags. Silas sends Lynsey a Catwoman outfit with an instruction to wear it at the fancy dress Halloween party at Chez Chez nightclub. Lynsey confides in Doug and tells him what Silas {{is planning}} and Brennan said he was [...] "very, very happy" [...] {{to be involved in the}} storyline again. Doug believes Lynsey, of which Hassan said [...] "On one hand, she feels like she shouldn't be dragging [...] into this mess, but she knows that she needs someone on her side". The actress added that Lynsey cannot believe her luck as Doug show her kindness and friendship and she wonders why she did not confide in him months ago. Rawle revealed that nobody in the village is safe, saying [...] "Theresa's already in his sights, Lynsey is a possible and so is Mercedes - he really doesn't like the McQueens!" [...] He added that there are [...] "lots of other women" [...] whose morals Silas would find questionable.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2015 AAA Mega Champion El Patrón Alberto {{found himself}} with an American [...] "invader" [...] {{challenging}} {{him in the}} form of Brian Cage, who had worked indirectly for AAA through Lucha Underground up until that point. Cage was immediately positioned as a challenger for El Patrón as he, El Hijo de Fantasma and Pentagón Jr. defeated El Patrón Alberto, Fénix and Myzteziz in his AAA debut match on February 27 when Cage pinned Alberto. El Patrón was scheduled to defend the Mega Championship against Cage as part of the 2015 Rey de Reyes show slated for March 15. however, when Guadalajara was hit with a rainstorm, AAA postponed the event for 24 hours and moved it indoors to Auditorio Benito Juarez in Zapopan, Jalisco. The following day AAA announced that they were not able to get all permits in time for the show due to it being it being a national holiday, and once again postponed the show to Wednesday March 18 instead. At the same time they announced that the announced match between El Patrón Alberto and Brian Cage had been cancelled. El Patrón Alberto later stated that he was legally obligated to compete in Australia later in the week and thus was not able to work the Wednesday show for AAA. On April 1 Cage defeated El Patrón in a Street Fight after members of La Sociedad interfered in the match to help Cage win the match, after which Cage once again challenged El Patrón to the title match he never received. A few weeks later the two faced off again in a one-on-one match, but this time it ended in a no-contest after interference from Dark Cuervo and Dark Scoria, which then brough out Jack Evans and Angélico turning it into a six-man tag team match that El Patrón, Evans and Angélico won when El Patrón pinned Cage. The two rivals found themselves on opposite sides in the Lucha Libre World Cup, with the [...] "Dream team" [...] of El Patrón, Rey Mysterio Jr. and Myzteziz defeated the team of Cage and Ring of Honor representatives Moose and ACH {{in the second round of}} the tournament. El Patrón was finally able to defend the Mega Championship against Cage at AAA's 2015 Verano de Escándalo show. The match saw interference from Cage's corner man El Texano Jr. as well as the rudo referee El Hijo del Tirantes favoring Cage throughout the match to stack the odds against El Patrón in the end a second, impartial referee came to the ring and declared a disqualification, leaving the issues between the two unresolved. After the match an enraged El Patrón Alberto laid out a challenge for a Lucha de Apuestas match against Cage, stating that he did not <b>care</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had to put his title on the line, wrestle in a steel cage or whatever it would take to get Cage to put his hair on the line in a match. Next AAA paired up El Patrón and Cage to fight against Blue Demon Jr. and Villano IV in a Pareja Increibles ("Incredible pairs") match, forcing two sets of rivals to team up for a match. As expected El Patrón and Cage were not able to get along, with Cage attacking El Patrón and throwing him through a table at ringside to allow Blue Demon Jr. and Villano IV to win the match. On the AAA television taping on July 10, 2015 Cage accepted the Lucha de Apuestas challenge made repeatedly by El Patrón Alberto. During the English language [...] "Triplemanía XXIII Countdown Special" [...] it was revealed that Alberto had stated that if he lost to Brian Cage he would leave AAA.|$|E
