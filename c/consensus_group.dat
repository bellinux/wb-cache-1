5|$|A very {{frequently}} discussed {{change to the}} UN structure {{is to change the}} permanent membership of the UN Security Council, which reflects the power structure of the world as it was in 1945. There are several proposed plans, notably by the G4 nations, by the Uniting for <b>Consensus</b> <b>group,</b> and by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.|$|E
5|$|One {{proposed}} change is to admit more permanent members. The candidates usually mentioned are Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan. They comprise {{the group of}} G4 nations, mutually supporting one another's bids for permanent seats. The United Kingdom, France and Russia support G4 membership in the U.N. Security Council. This sort of reform has traditionally been opposed by the Uniting for <b>Consensus</b> <b>group,</b> which is composed primarily of nations who are regional rivals and economic competitors of the G4. The group is led by Italy and Spain (opposing Germany), Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina (opposing Brazil), Pakistan (opposing India), and South Korea (opposing Japan), in addition to Turkey, Indonesia and others. Since 1992, Italy {{and other members of}} the group have instead proposed semi-permanent seats or the expansion of the number of temporary seats.|$|E
25|$|Permanent {{membership}} of the UN Security Council {{is widely regarded as}} being a central tenet of great power status in the modern world; Brazil, Germany, India and Japan form the G4 nations which support one another (and have varying degrees of support from the existing permanent members) in becoming permanent members. The G4 is opposed by the Italian-led Uniting for <b>Consensus</b> <b>group.</b> There are however few signs that reform of the Security Council will happen in the near future.|$|E

40|$|We often {{remember}} in groups, yet research on collaborative recall finds “collaborative inhibition”: Recalling with others has costs compared to recalling alone. In related paradigms, remembering with others introduces errors into recall. We compared {{costs and benefits}} of two collaboration procedures—turn taking and consensus. First, 135 individuals learned a word list and recalled it alone (Recall 1). Then, 45 participants in three-member groups took turns to recall, 45 participants in three-member <b>groups</b> reached a <b>consensus,</b> and 45 participants recalled alone but were analysed as three-member nominal groups (Recall 2). Finally, all participants recalled alone (Recall 3). Both turn-taking and <b>consensus</b> <b>groups</b> demonstrated the usual pattern of costs during collaboration and benefits after collaboration in terms of recall completeness. However, <b>consensus</b> <b>groups,</b> and not turn-taking groups, demonstrated clear benefits in terms of recall accuracy, both during and after collaboration. <b>Consensus</b> <b>groups</b> engaged in beneficial group source-monitoring processes. Our findings challenge assumptions about the negative consequences of social remembering. 16 page(s...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT : Many {{software}} architectural {{decisions are}} group decisions rather than {{decisions made by}} individuals. <b>Consensus</b> in a <b>group</b> of decision makers increases the acceptance of a decision among decision makers and their confidence in that decision. Furthermore, going {{through the process of}} reaching consensus means that decision makers understand better the decision (including the decision topic, decision options, rationales, and potential outcomes). Little guidance exists on how to increase <b>consensus</b> in <b>group</b> architectural decision making. OBJECTIVE : We evaluate how a newly proposed process (named GADGET) helps architects increase <b>consensus</b> when making <b>group</b> architectural decisions. Specifically, we investigate how well GADGET increases <b>consensus</b> in <b>group</b> architectural decision making, by understanding its practical applicability, and by comparing GADGET against group architectural decision making without using any prescribed approach. METHOD : We conducted two empirical studies. First, we conducted an exploratory case study to understand the practical applicability of GADGET in industry. We investigated whether {{there is a need to}} increase consensus, the effort and benefits of GADGET, and potential improvements for GADGET. Second, we conducted an experiment with 113 students from three universities to compare GADGET against group architectural decision making without using any prescribed approach. RESULTS : GADGET helps decision makers increase their consensus, captures knowledge on architectural decisions, clarifies the different points of view of different decision makers on the decision, and increases the focus of the group discussions about a decision. From the experiment, we obtained causal evidence that GADGET increases <b>consensus</b> better than <b>group</b> architectural decision making without using any prescribed approach. CONCLUSIONS : There is a need to increase <b>consensus</b> in <b>group</b> architectural decisions. GADGET helps inexperienced architects increase <b>consensus</b> in <b>group</b> architectural decision making, and provides additional benefits, such as capturing rationale of decisions. Future work is needed to understand and improve other aspects of group architectural decision making. [URL] Scienc...|$|R

By using the decentralized adaptive <b>group</b> <b>consensus</b> algorithm and without using any global information of the underlying network, all agents in the same group asymptotically synchronize with the corresponding leader even when only one agent in each group {{has access to the}} information of the corresponding leader.

40|$|Groups – teams, work groups, {{departments}} – are {{the building}} blocks of organizations, but ‘no team is an island’. Groups need to coordinate and align their strategic efforts for the organization at large to perform. To better understand how groups can integrate their strategic efforts to operate as parts of a bigger whole, this dissertation investigates the crucial yet under-researched topic of strategic <b>consensus</b> between <b>groups.</b> If <b>groups</b> have strategic <b>consensus,</b> shared understanding of the strategy, {{they are more likely to}} coordinate and integrate more effectively and better perform their collaborative tasks. The four studies composing this dissertation (1) propose a new method to measure, visualize and aggregate individual cognition to group- and between group-level with a more comprehensive, integrative conceptualization of the multiple dimensions of consensus; (2) demonstrate that the group with the strongest group identification and the group with the lowest organizational identification in an organizational dyad respectively limit and foster achieving a high degree of strategic consensus between groups; (3) show that in a dyad the centrality of each group is a determining factor for the degree of <b>consensus</b> between the <b>groups</b> and the most central individuals are an important driver for strategic alignment between groups; (4) indicate that strategic <b>consensus</b> between <b>groups</b> and boundary spanning behavior are requisites for intergroup cooperation, and the effect of strategic <b>consensus</b> between <b>groups</b> on intergroup cooperation is moderated by the degree to which groups display boundary spanning behavior. Together these findings extend strategic management along behavioral lines, offering an integrative view of strategic <b>consensus</b> between <b>groups...</b>|$|R
40|$|Using an {{experimental}} trust game, I examine whether the perspectives {{and behavior of}} <b>group</b> representatives and <b>consensus</b> <b>groups</b> {{differ from those of}} the same individuals in an analogous inter-individual situation. A primary goal of this research is to extend past work on trust and reciprocity by examining the impact of the social contexts within which social interactions are characteristically embedded. Specifically, this research concerns whether norms and dynamics of trust and reciprocity differ in the contexts of inter-individual and inter-group interactions. First, I examine whether dynamics of trust and reciprocity differ in various inter-group interactions where inter-group decisions are operationalized as 1) autonomous group representatives, i. e., individuals who are given the responsibility of unilaterally making a decision on behalf of a three-person group engaging with a group representative of another such group; and 2) <b>consensus</b> <b>groups,</b> i. e., group members making a consensus trust or reciprocity decision for their groups via a collective process with another such group. Results of these studies show that 1) people trust less and reciprocate less when responsible for a group or organizational decision as autonomous <b>group</b> representatives; 2) <b>consensus</b> <b>groups</b> do not differ from individuals in their level of trust but show dramatically less reciprocity. The <b>group</b> <b>consensus</b> mechanism in fact produced by far the lowest reciprocity level, significantly lower than that exhibited by either individuals or autonomous group representatives. Thus, inter-group trust and reciprocity dynamics are not readily inferable from their inter-individual counterparts. Moreover, an important implication is emerging here: the extent and direction of the discrepancy between individual and group choices in regard to trust and reciprocity levels and possibly other social preferences in general may depend importantly on the precise details of the group decision-making mechanism, for example whether decisions are made consensually, by majority vote, or by a group leader or representative. In addition to examining the level of trust and reciprocity that occur in these various situations, I also studied, using both behavioral and questionnaire data, the roles of self-interest, social influence, and group dynamics in trust and reciprocity perceptions and behavior. The results showed that there exist discrepancies between behavioral forecasts and the actual behavior, and that trusting behavior is driven strongly by expectation of level of reciprocation, while reciprocating behavior is driven strongly by the difference between trust expectation and actual trust received.
