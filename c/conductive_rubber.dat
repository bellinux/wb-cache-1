30|$|Using water-assisted {{chemical}} vapor deposition (CVD), {{we reported}} the synthesis of a vertically aligned SWCNT array (SWCNT forest) with height exceeding a millimeter [19]. The SWCNT forests possessed several excellent structural properties, such as long length, high purity, and high specific surface area. This development opened up the potential for various new applications of CNTs, such as high-performance super-capacitors [20 – 23] and highly durable <b>conductive</b> <b>rubbers</b> [24, 25]. Subsequently, many groups reported the growth of long SWCNTs. For example, Zhong et al. reported the growth of SWCNT forests reaching 0.5  cm in length [26]. Hasegawa et al. reported growth of SWCNT forests of several millimeters in length without an etching agent (water) [27]. Numerous studies have also reported the synthesis of multiwalled CNT forests [28 – 30]. However, the following points remain unclear at present: the correlations between forest height and (1) the actual CNT length and (2) the electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties after formation of CNT assemblies.|$|R

These outstanding properties show that the SR composite has potential applications in tensile and pressure sensors...|$|R
40|$|Conductive {{plastics}} are attracting {{more and}} more interest in electronics due to their light weight and inability to rust, which are common problems associated with metals. The field of conducting plastics is not new. Much {{work has been done}} to impart electrical conductivity to mechanically strong polymers such as polypropylene, polycarbonate and epoxies, etc. However {{there is a need to}} fabricate more flexible and elastic conductive polymers such as conducting silicone rubbers for use in various applications. In this work silicone <b>rubbers</b> reinforced with <b>conductive</b> fillers have been fabricated for use as sensors in textiles to detect the resistance change produced by stretching or relaxing. The variations of electrical resistance have been investigated by stretching and releasing the strands of <b>conductive</b> <b>rubbers</b> as a function of time. Two types of silicone rubbers—addition cured and condensation cured—were compounded with different electrically conductive fillers, among which carbon fibers have shown the best results. The carbon fibers improved the electrical conductance of the rubbers, even in very low weight percentages. The increasing concentration of fillers decreases the elasticity of the rubber. In order to keep the original properties of silicones, the filler concentration was kept as low as possible to produce a significantly detectable signal. The fabricated compounds were analyzed for their mechanical properties by stress strain curves. Such materials find their applications in electronics, antistatic applications, sports and the automotive industry where they can be used as deformation sensors...|$|R

Therefore, the thesis highlights the potential of these two materials as a tactile sensing transducer and later describes the best design parameters for them to be applied as a tactile sensor. In the thesis, the tactile sensing mechanism that includes the operating principle and hardware architecture of the sensor are explained. The experimental setup to determine the fundamental properties of <b>Conductive</b> <b>Rubber</b> Sheet (CRS) and Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills is presented. Resistivity behavior is of the major factors in choosing <b>Conductive</b> <b>Rubber</b> Sheet (CRS) and Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills over the other materials. These materials resistivity need to be tested to ascertain its viability as a tactile sensor. The parameters are voltage supply, the separation gap and sensor construction. The results show the Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills is better in term of reproducibility and stability of the resistance values as compared to the <b>Conductive</b> <b>Rubber</b> Sheet (CRS). However in terms of the sensitivity, <b>Conductive</b> <b>Rubber</b> Sheet (CRS) is better in comparison with the Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills whereby it can cover lower loading range when compared to QTC Pills. However, since the reproducibility of <b>Conductive</b> <b>Rubber</b> Sheet (CRS); 5. 05 Q standard deviation is lower than the Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills; 2. 110. standard deviation, it is more preferable to choose the Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills over <b>Conductive</b> <b>Rubber</b> Sheet (CRS). Furthermore with 5 V supply voltage and 0. 5 mm separation gap, the Quantum Tunnelling Composite (QTC) Pills can perform well similar to the 25 V supply voltage.

40|$|Abstract. Gripping {{and holding}} of objects are key tasks for robotic manipulators. The {{development}} of universal grippers {{able to pick}} up unfamiliar objects of widely varying shapes and surfaces is a very challenging task. Passively compliant underactuated mechanisms are one way to obtain the gripper which could accommodate to any irregular and sensitive grasping objects. The purpose of the underactuation is to use the power of one actuator to drive the open and close motion of the gripper. The underactuation can morph shapes of the gripper to accommodate to different objects. As a result, they require less complex control algorithms. The fully compliant mechanism has multiple degrees of freedom and can be considered as an underactuated mechanism.
