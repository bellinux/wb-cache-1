40|$|The {{volume of}} cargo flowing through todays {{transportation}} system is growing at an ever increasing rate. Recent studies show that 90 % of all international cargo that enters the United States flows through our vast seaport system. When this cargo enters the US, {{time is of the}} essence to quickly obtain and verify its identity, screen it against an ever increasingly wide variety of security concerns, and ultimately correctly direct the cargo towards its final destination. Over the past few years, new port and container security initiatives and regulations have generated huge interest in the need for accurate real-time identification and tracking of incoming and outgoing traffic of vehicles and cargo. On the contrary, the manually intensive identification and tracking processes, typically employed today, are inherently both inefficient and inadequate, and can be seen as a possible enabling factor for potential threats to our ports and therefore our national security. The contradiction between current and required processes coupled to the correlation with accelerated growth in container traffic, has clearly identified the need for a solution. One heavily researched option is the utilization of video based systems implementing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) processes for automatically extracting the unique <b>container</b> <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> to expedite the flow of cargo through various points in the seaport. The actual current process of how this occurs along with the opportunities and challenges for adding such a technological solution will be investigated in great detail. This thesis will investigate the feasibility of application of motion compensation algorithms as an enhancement to OCR systems specifically designed to address the challenges of OCR of cargo containers in a seaport environment. This motion compensation could offer a cost effective alternative to the sophisticated hardware systems currently being offered to US ports. M. S.

40|$|In {{the case}} of {{ordinary}} <b>identification</b> <b>coding,</b> a code is devised to identify a single object among $N$ objects. But, in this paper, we consider an <b>identification</b> <b>coding</b> problem to identify $K$ objects at once among $N$ objects in the both cases that $K$ objects are ranked or not ranked. By combining Kurosawa-Yoshida scheme with Moulin-Koetter scheme, an efficient <b>identification</b> <b>coding</b> scheme is proposed, which can attain high coding rate and error exponents compared with the case that an ordinary <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> is used $K$ times. Furthermore, the achievable triplet of rate and error exponents of type I and type II decoding error probabilities are derived for the proposed coding scheme.

40|$|Packages {{have high}} {{rotation}} {{as they become}} municipal solid waste just after the consumption of the product. Therefore, packages should be labeled with identification of the material they are made of {{in order to help}} the recycling chain. Many products made from plastics show a resin <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> - usually from 1 to 7 inside a three-arrow triangle above a monogram - aimed at identifying the type of plastic the product is made of, and help its separation and later recycling. In other words, one aims to facilitate recovery of plastics discarded with the municipal solid waste. In this study we collected data on the resin <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> in flexible plastic packages to assess whether the guidelines for material identification are being followed. The data collection was performed in a total of 509 flexible plastic packages used for packing food and non-food products available in the Brazilian market. Even though the NBR 13230 Brazilian standard is already in its second revision, the resin <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> in plastic packages is still used in a very heterogeneous fashion. Approximately 50 % of the packages had the resin <b>identification</b> <b>code.</b> Up to 30 % of some packages showed incorrect material <b>identification</b> <b>code.</b> Therefore, misinformation still occurs in the Brazilian market concerning the type of material for plastic packaging - including lack of the resin <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> and incorrect form of <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> in the plastic packaging. Both of these problems have negative effects on the plastic recycling chain. We propose that other materials used in flexible plastic packages, e. g. aluminum foil, should also be identified, {{in order to make the}} separation and recycling easier...|$|R
