The interruptions allowed for the materials to stop moving forward between interruptions along the shaft and also allows for an adequate buildup of the material before it is pushed through the screw press to container that catches the material. This allowed for a better job at the dewatering and a consistent cake material being released.|$|R

50|$|The {{stadium is}} made up of {{different}} tiers; during the Games the stadium was able to hold 80,000 spectators. The base tier, which allows for 25,000 seats, is a sunken elliptical bowl that {{is made up}} of low-carbon-dioxide concrete; this contains 40 percent less embodied carbon than conventional concrete. The foundation of the base level is 5,000 piles reaching up to 20 m deep. From there, there is a mixture of driven cast in situ piles, <b>continuous</b> <b>flight</b> <b>auger</b> piles, and vibro concrete columns. The second tier, which holds 55,000 seats, is 315 m long, 256 m wide, and 60 m high.

In addition to the minimal use of steel, which makes it 75 percent lighter, the stadium also uses high-yield large diameter pipes which were surplus on completion of North Sea Gas pipeline projects in its compression truss, recycled granite, and many of the building products were transported using trains and barges rather than by lorry.|$|E

Bachy Soletanche Ltd, who received the £1.5 million contract, commenced work on the site by installing a deep contiguous piled wall around the site. The 220 m perimeter wall consists of 241 contiguous piles, which were chosen by project design consultant WSP. The piles are 750 mm in diameter. The piles will hold back the ground that consists of a few metres of fill, then a 3 m to 5 m thick sand layer which becomes weathered sandstone further down. Because the bedrock slopes from 2 m to 14 m down across the site, the piles must be up to 17.5 m deep. As excavation on the site commenced, the company installed 70 ground anchors to the wall. Each of the anchors are 15 m long and 178 mm diameter. These are for temporary support of the wall whilst the basement is being constructed. When construction is completed, they will remain. Some of the piles were drilled using a cased Large Diameter Auger (LDA) rotary bored piling method, while other parts of the wall were drilled using the <b>Continuous</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Auger</b> (CFA) method. Alongside the contiguous piled wall, Bachy Soletanche Ltd also constructed ten 1200 mm diameter LDA plunge column piles and fourteen 750 mm diameter bearing piles.Ten plunge columns were installed on the site for the main access ramp. These consisted of large, steel H-section columns surrounded by pea gravel within their pile casings. Bachy Soletanche installed a basic bored pile with casing and then used its special plunge column rig to achieve the 5 mm accuracy needed for the positioning of the I section steel columns. A steel frame sitting on the casings, had three sets of hydraulic rams for precision adjustment of the central steel while it was fixed with around 5 m of concrete at the pile base. As site excavation progressed, these were slowly being exposed again. PC Harrington is doing the excavation and the concreting of the base whilst Altius will commence the main construction works. The crane base for TC1, the second tower crane, was delivered to the site on 30 January 2008. The crane was assembled on 16 February, however, not to the anticipated 82 m.|$|E

40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (EngD), at Loughborough University. The field of pile design and construction in the United Kingdom is currently {{in a period of}} change. Not only are new processes and techniques being developed but also the legislative landscape is changing with the introduction of new Europe wide normative standards (BSI, 2004, 2007). This project sought to optimise pile design through better understanding and interpretation of ground conditions and of the pile-soil interaction for two pile types, <b>continuous</b> <b>flight</b> <b>auger</b> and bored displacement piles. Quantitative methods for interpreting and summarising previous knowledge and experience have been developed; the strata are divided into discrete bands and properties are represented with summary statistics. Experience and previous knowledge relating to the shear strength of London Clay have been quantified and presented using this approach. Furthermore, a straightforward tool has been provided for the implementation of such data into design; the previous knowledge and new site specific data are combined using Bayesian updating. Through use of this technique, the uncertainty associated with interpreting ground conditions from site data has been demonstrated to be reduced. The techniques described have been adopted into design practice within the sponsoring company. Bored displacement piles are a relatively new pile type. There is little published data or scientific understanding of the processes undergone by the soils during and after construction and the effect that these have on pile performance. This research identified the need for, and developed, a unified framework of descriptors for the various types of bored displacement pile and investigated the installation energy and performance of bored displacement piles in London Clay. The energy to construct the pile was observed to be highly variable and not directly related to capacity. Performance of bored displacement piles was observed to be similar to <b>continuous</b> <b>flight</b> <b>auger</b> piles of similar dimensions; typical values for the adhesion between bored displacement piles and the surrounding soil were established and these were comparable to those achieved by <b>continuous</b> <b>flight</b> <b>auger</b> piles. In addition, to enable the analysis of the probability of failure of a pile, the sources of variation have been investigated and the variability quantified. Besides the soil conditions, the dimensions of the pile, notably pile diameter, were found to be a significant source of variation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of field experiments performed to study the development of shaft resistance on <b>Continuous</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Auger</b> piles installed in sand. The test piles were instrumented in order to separate the shaft and base resistance, and to allow the determination of the distribution of shaft resistance along the pile shaft. The tests highlighted the importance of accurate calculation of the shaft resistance for non-displacement piles. At a typical maximum allowable pile head settlement of 25 mm, more than 71 % of the pile resistance was provided by shaft friction. Conventional methods of estimating shaft resistance were assessed. It was found that methods which incorporated parameters directly interpreted from in-situ test results provided the most consistent estimates.
