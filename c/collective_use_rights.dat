It analyses an unsuccessful attempt by the ruling political group to change the institutional arrangements of water control, to serve better their private goals. This example shows that not all internal institutional innovations {{in the field of}} utilising natural resources lead to increased efficiency of the system {{from the point of view}} of the whole community. We draw on New Institutional Economics (NIE) and Common Property Resource Management (CPRM) theory to analyse the way in which it was possible that those few within Sonjo society who are formally/nominally 'the owners' of water sought to privatise de facto <b>collective</b> <b>use</b> <b>rights</b> of all community members. We consider why this was done in some, but not all, Sonjo communities, and we describe why this process has eventually failed. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the concept of law and urban {{development}} {{with a focus on}} property rights and land, exploring the potential collective rights in the public domain to underpin a more equitable approach to the management of public space and challenge inappropriate regulation that criminalizes the lives of the poor. The focus is on street trade and the informal economy. The hypotheses are that: <b>collective</b> <b>use</b> <b>rights</b> extend to public land and are crucial to the livelihoods of the urban poor; such use provides public good as well as private profit, and legal traditions in sub-Saharan Africa can often accommodate the broad definition of rights entailed. The literature review interrogates debates on property rights, legal empowerment, and public space, to suggest that urban public space should be considered as a common resource where open access remains. Fieldwork draws on comparative studies of Dakar, Senegal, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, based on in-depth interviews with street traders and key informants, and a legal review in each city. The findings suggest very different trajectories in each city. In Dakar collective action with political support has created space for dialog, while in Dar es Salaam lack of solidarity among traders meant that evictions were uncontested. In both cities the balance between public and private gain was moderated through complex social processes to create the hybrid space of the street, defined here as a ‘collective pool resource’. Finally the paper explores bundles of rights that might include access and beneficial use but with collective management to establish such a ‘collective pool resource’. Thus the paper challenges the usual conception of the public domain as state land, to recognize the collective claim for the street that is core to the operation of urban informal economies...|$|E

Urban Mining represents actions and technologies {{that can be}} adopted to recover resources from residues produced by the urban catabolism (municipal, industrial and agricultural waste, both from new production and old deposits) in terms of secondary raw materials and energy. It implicates progression beyond separate collection and the current logic of consumers responsibility, resulting in an increased recovery of resources, better quality of the same, improved environmental protection, involvement of producer responsibility and lower costs for society.

40|$|The {{wholesale}} {{adoption of}} copyright collective management as public policy tool {{has had an}} extraordinary impact on the information landscape. The unfettered expansion of collective rights organizations throughout the 20 th century has resulted in increased social costs and a burgeoning bureaucracy surrounding the <b>collective</b> <b>use</b> of <b>rights.</b> This thesis considers the role of copyright tribunals within that process, and more importantly within a critical historical frame. While some {{work has been done}} with respect to copyright tribunals and their role in the policy process, none of it has considered the tribunals within a critical frame. This thesis considers those agencies, and the Copyright Board of Canada in particular, within the context of their initial creation as oversight on copyright collectives, their subsequent regulatory practice and their current role within the larger policy frame. Utilizing Antonio Gramsci’s conception of hegemony, the thesis views the current capture of those agencies as a further indication of the growing hegemony surrounding copyright in general and collective management regimes in particular...|$|R
30|$|There are {{different}} types of land titling, and {{we still do not}} know which one is optimal for each case. More studies are needed to study the effect of {{different types of}} land titles and the degree of titling. UN-Habitat (2007), for example, advocates various interim occupancy rights such as granting nontransferable short-term leases, <b>collective</b> property <b>rights,</b> <b>use</b> of community land trusts, and protection against eviction. Galiani and Schargrodsky (2011) point out that the main decision should be in terms of individual recording or registration. Arruñada and Garoupa (2005) studied the relative efficiency of these two systems and found evidence that, at least in developed countries, registration is more efficient (with efficiency increasing with the frequency of land transactions).|$|R
40|$|In China, {{changes in}} rural {{settlement}} patterns are crucial {{because they may}} affect agricultural sustainability through encroachment on productive cropland and water resources and also reduce biodiversity. Rapid urbanization with accompanying socioeconomic transformation has resulted in decrease of the rural register population (RRP) in China since 2000. The effects of this change in RRP on rural settlement area (RSA) and the factors shaping {{the relationship between these}} measures of population and land use have attracted extensive research interest. We investigated the changes in RRP and RSA and used a decoupling model to analyze the relationship between them. We found that whereas RRP in China increased by 1. 12 % during 1996 - 2000, it decreased by 4. 91 % during 2000 - 2005. RSA increased by 0. 62 % and 0. 09 % during the periods 1996 - 2000 and 2000 - 2005, respectively. The RSA was slightly decoupled from RRP during 1996 - 2000 due to the shift in rural housing from one-floor houses to multi-floor houses. In the period 2000 - 2005, RSA was actually strongly negatively decoupled from RRP due to village-hollowing, which was driven mainly by a dual-track real property system (ownership by <b>collectives,</b> but <b>use</b> <b>rights</b> for individuals) as well as institutional managerial and socioeconomic factors. In central and western China, the RSA was better able to be decoupled from RRP than in eastern China due to interprovincial rural migration. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{an apparent}} 'early stage' governance {{transformation in the}} Tam Giang Lagoon, Vietnam. In this context, the role of key policy windows for innovative governance practice is assessed (e. g., changes to Land and Fisheries Laws). Also examined {{is the emergence of}} recent initiatives to catalyze a wider shift in governance practice in the region, including the formation of co-management institutional networks that contribute to trust building and learning, and the allocation of <b>collective</b> territorial <b>use</b> <b>rights</b> for fisheries. While these changes are consistent with experiences in other coastal marine contexts, the paper shows that place-based and longitudinal research is necessary to explain and predict the conditions and incentives that catalyze governance shifts. Differences between a governance change and more fundamental transformation are difficult to discern using point-in-time analysis. Moreover, the results show that current declines in ecological conditions in the lagoon may not be reversed by changes to access rights or the emergence of co-management. Rather, these governance changes may simply help to stabilize the situation and buy time until other livelihood opportunities arise. Assessments of governance transformation thus need to be linked to ecological outcomes (i. e., reversing degradation of coastal marine systems, avoiding biophysical tipping points) which may not be easily identified in the short-term. Despite uncertainty, the emergence of policy windows, evidence of institutional innovation, and small-scale rights allocation experiments, all suggest important shifts in the trajectory of governance are underway in the Tam Giang Lagoon.

40|$|The {{debate about}} how to govern {{personal}} data has intensified in recent years. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which comes into effect in 2018, relies on transparency mechanisms codified through obligations for organizations and citizen rights. While some of these rights have existed for decades, their effectiveness is rarely tested in practice. This paper reports on the exercise of the so-called right of access, which gives citizens the right {{to get access to}} their personal data. We study this by working with participants—citizens for whom the law is written—who collectively sent over a hundred data access requests and shared the responses with us. We analyze the replies to the access requests, as well as the participant's evaluation of them. We find that non-compliance with the law's obligations is widespread. Participants were critical of many responses, though they also reported a large variation in quality. They did not find them effective for getting transparency into the processing of their own personal data. We did find a way forward emerging from their responses, namely by looking at the requests as a collective endeavor, rather than an individual one. Comparing the responses to similar access requests creates a context to judge the quality of a reply and the lawfulness of the data practices it reveals. Moreover, <b>collective</b> <b>use</b> of the <b>right</b> of access can help shift the power imbalance between individual citizens and organizations in favor of the citizen, which may incentivize organizations to deal with data in a more transparent way...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays a high {{variety of}} IT tools is {{available}} for communication purposes in design processes on individual and group level. Despite this, the exchange and sharing of design documents collectively in design and engineering teams might be limited mainly, due to habits, preferences, working methods and rivalry between the <b>collective</b> <b>use</b> of IT tools in such product development. Changes in habits and preferences for <b>collective</b> <b>use</b> of IT tools might be realized by training and management power. However, adoption of collectively to be used tools, like project websites, is depending heavenly on the attractiveness for users in daily work. Based on empirical research outcomes it is indicated that rivalry between <b>collective</b> <b>used</b> tools and differences in working methods of users might be main barriers for attractiveness of these tools in daily work. Applying a framework for analyzing and categorizing of the frequency of use of IT tools for team communication, the authors explain the appearance of rivalry between tools, limiting the effectiveness in daily work and not affecting team communication and performance. By comparison of working methods in different sectors authors explain the necessity of changes in working methods in design and engineering in the building & construction industry on organizational and inter-organizational level for successful adoption of collectively to be used IT tools in team communication. ...|$|R
