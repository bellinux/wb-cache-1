40|$|Fish {{contains}} beneficial nutritional compounds, such as long-chain polyunsaturated {{fatty acids}} (omega- 3 PUFAs), and vitamin D. High fish consumption and high omega- 3 PUFA intake may protect against several diseases. Conversely, fish may also contain various persistent environmental contaminants, such as dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The Baltic Sea area is heavily contaminated with persistent organic pollutants. The results obtained so far show that eating fish {{twice a week}} is not harmful to human health. Situation could be different, when we {{will be looking at}} coastal fishermen, who eat significantly more fish. Aim {{of this study was to}} assess the extent of coastal fishermen exposure to the total amount of PCDD, PCDF and DL-PCB obtained from fish and fish products. The consumption survey for <b>coastal</b> <b>fisherman</b> was carried out in May 2010. During the peak of the fishing seasons the fishermen and their families eat more fish than usual and obtain the toxins in quantities larger than yearly average. The evaluation of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs exposure, based on total quantities of fish consumed in a week, indicates that the current dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs exposure of <b>coastal</b> <b>fisherman</b> is above the TDI. Therefore it is advisable that, coastal fishermen and their families significantly increase the consumption of low-fat fish and reduce the consumption of fatty fish...|$|E

However, fishermen are deprived from getting reasonable prices of their catches due to a large price spread between the price paid by the ultimate consumers or users and price received by the <b>coastal</b> <b>fisherman.</b> With the vision of building Digital Bangladesh of present government, the application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have become an extremely vital for reducing poverty, illiteracy and overall structural inefficiencies in Bangladesh. At the time of booming of information communication technology in the country, mobile communication is playing a fundamental role by coordinating supply and demand of the catches, providing free flow of price information to the fishermen in the remote areas. Under the above circumstances, the main objective of the research is to find out the role of mobile phone in fish marketing system that ultimately enhance the economic condition of which originates in coastal fishing communities of Bangladesh. This study includes exhaustive literature review; secondary data analysis, and interviews with 200 individuals having connection with fisheries from four coastal areas of Bangladesh.

Their operational cost inreased because have to look around and spent some extra fuel {{to search for the}} presence of fish.

SST was then used as the primary input in thermal front detection using Single Image Edge Detection (SIED) method (1992, Cayula and Cornillon). SIED method has been implemented using low-resolution satellite imagery for Indonesian waters including Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) with sensor Visible/Infrared Imager and Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The {{purpose of this study is}} to know the movement of thermal fronts in coastal areas.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of the development of aquaculture in the Philippines on the local economy, focusing on coastal fishers in two towns in Capiz and Iloilo, Panay Island, Philippines. Coastal residents in the two towns closely depend on fishing and aquaculture for both their primary and secondary incomes. The small-scale aquaculture business commenced by <b>coastal</b> <b>fishermen</b> has been expanding particularly after the 1990 s. The planting of mangrove trees is promoted and small-scale aquafarming is done by <b>coastal</b> <b>fishermen</b> who exert only small environmental loads. Small-scale aquaculture, including the aquaculture of shellfish, net cage culture, pen culture, and seaweed culture, requires low initial investment and imposes minimal workload on operators in terms of breeding management up to shipment, which is why most coastal fishing people want to continue in the business. On the other hand, pond culture, practiced before the 1990 s, promises no further rise in production for several reasons that include overproduction of milkfish and the outbreak of diseases in shrimp and prawn. Under these conditions, small-scale aquaculturists in two towns have established a sustainable aquaculture production system that allows them to maintain mangrove forests, utilize natural recirculation functions and help local residents obtain income.

This paper analyses the range of motives for non-compliant behaviour among <b>coastal</b> cod <b>fishermen.</b> A multinomial logit model is employed to analyse the reasons that underlie various motives. The four motives compared in this study are economic, technological and social, and motives caused by bureaucracy and legitimacy problems. The economic motive is found to be most important for <b>coastal</b> <b>fishermen.</b> However, the cross-sectional data indicate that motives vary with fishing gear, vessel length, and fishermen's age. The results indicate that identifying motives for non-compliant behaviour is not straightforward but is important for reducing the extent of infringements of the regulations. Fishermen who use gill-net, seine and long line, for example, are more often motivated to non-compliance by technical problems and bureaucracy than hand-jig fishers. The study suggests that in order to prevent non-compliance behaviour, the authorities' management policy should be designed to address the problems encountered by different categories of fishers. For example, offences that are committed because of technical problems should be resolved by increasing the involvement of fishermen in the process of drawing up regulations, whereas offences motivated by economic factors should be reduced by increasing inspections...|$|R

We use Baltic salmon fishery to show how complex interactions between national fleets, offshore and <b>coastal</b> <b>fishermen,</b> and migratory stock dynamics can be analysed with a bio-economic model set up as a game of four asymmetric players. For Baltic salmon there is a stochastic and complex bio-economic model conditioned on a state-space Bayesian stock assessment which captures uncertainty in stock dynamics. We calculate Nash equilibrium under various cost and price scenarios for each combination of a salmon population model parameters, using an MCMC chain obtained from their joint posterior distribution so that the correlations between different life-history parameters are accounted for. We use results of many simulations to explore how natural variability and economic uncertainties affect Nash equilibrium strategies...|$|R
