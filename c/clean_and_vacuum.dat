40|$|Sliding {{friction}} and adhesive contact interactions between microgear silicon-based MEMS teeth {{working in a}} <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> <b>vacuum</b> environment have been modelled using a multiscale hierarchical elastic structure. Here the results of numerical simulations based {{on the use of}} multiscale block model are presented. The tooth is modelled as a bulk silicon-based MEMS surface covered by roughness having two subscales specified by the character of interactions: atomic subscale level and adhesive subscale. Friction over completely meshing teeth surfaces is estimated by calculation of the total energy dissipated during sliding. The dissipation is caused by the different physical and chemical mechanisms. Due to the vacuum environment, these mechanisms reduced to the energy lost by the dissociation of chemical and van der Waals bonds, and by the elastic interlocking between the asperities located on the meshing micro-tooth surfaces. It is argued that due to the Polonsky-Keer effect, there is no plastic deformation of the MEMS tooth surface asperities because the asperity sizes are within the validity of this effect. The adhesion layer is defined employing ideas of the Maugis approximation. The adhesion force of each nanoasperity has assumed to be equal to the pull-off force in the Boussinesq-Kendall model corrected by the Borodich no-slip coefficient. The simulations show that MEMS with the clean silicon surfaces of teeth cannot work due to stiction between surfaces, while friction between tooth surfaces functionalised by carbon-based layer is much smaller. If the functionalised coating is worn away then stiction may occur...|$|E

During the last five years, increasing concern about global warming {{has led to an}} intense search for cost-effective alterna-tive energy sources such as photovoltaics. 1 Yet existing com-mercial silicon-based (i. e., inorganic) solar cells have limited use.

40|$|The near {{monoenergetic}} beam {{of neutral}} helium and argon atoms impinged {{on a single}} crystal tungsten target, with the (100) face exposed to the beam. The target was mounted on a torsion balance.

40|$|To {{answer the}} growing needs for super-clean or contact free {{actuators}} for uses in <b>clean</b> rooms, <b>vacuum</b> chambers, <b>and</b> space, innovative actuators which combine {{the functions of}} stepping motors and magnetic bearings in one body were developed. The rotor of the magnetically suspended stepping motor is suspended like a magnetic bearing and rotated and positioned like a stepping motor.

Owing to optimal design and feed-back control, a toothed stator and rotor are all that are needed structurewise for stable suspension. More than ten types of motors such as linear type, high accuracy rotary type, two-dimensional type, <b>and</b> high <b>vacuum</b> type were built and tested.

40|$|Brush motors {{have been}} {{qualified}} and flown successfully on Mars missions, but upcoming missions require longer life and higher power. A test program was therefore undertaken {{to identify the}} best brush material for operation in Mars atmosphere. Six different brush materials were used in 1 8 identical motors and operated under various load conditions {{for a period of}} four weeks in low-pressure C 02. All motors performed acceptably, with accumulated motor revolutions between 98 and 144 million revolutions, depending on load. A proprietary silver-graphite material from Superior Carbon (SG 54 - 27) appears to be the best choice for long life, but even the stock copper-graphite brushes performed reliably with acceptable wear. The motors from the C 0 2 test were then <b>cleaned</b> <b>and</b> run in <b>vacuum</b> for 2 weeks. The difference in results was dramatic, with 5 motors failing catastrophically and wear rates increasing by orders of magnitude for the SG 54 - 27 material. Three brush materials survived the test with no failures: SG 54 - 27 with a proprietary Ball Aerospace impregnation, a silver-graphite-molybdenum disulfide material from Superior Carbon (SG 59), and a copper sulfide-graphite material also from Superior Carbon (BG 91) ...|$|R

40|$|The contact {{interactions}} between microgear silicon-based MEMS teeth {{working in a}} <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> a <b>vacuum</b> environment are under consideration. A new approach has {{used to determine the}} friction force and the coefficient of friction over the whole meshing surfaces of the teeth. In this approach, the dry friction force is calculated through the energy dissipated during sliding contact between two meshed micro-tooth elastic rough surfaces. The energy dissipated may be caused by the different physical and chemical {{interactions between}} the counterparts surfaces. Due to the vacuum environment, these mechanisms reduced to the energy lost due to the dissociation of chemical and van der Waals bonds, and the energy lost through the elastic interlocking between the asperities located on the meshing micro-tooth surfaces. There is no plastic deformation of the microgear tooth surface asperities due to their size and the Polonsky-Keer effect. A multiscale hierarchical elastic structure (a multiscale block) is used to model the surface asperities. The tooth block roughness has modelled at two scales specified by the character of interactions: atomic level, where chemical interactions occur, and adhesive subscale, where van der Waals interactions are significant. The adhesion layer is defined similarly to Maugis approximation. The adhesion force of each nanoasperity has assumed to be equal to the pull-off force in the Boussinesq-Kendall model and corrected by the Borodich no-slip coefficient. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) techniques have been used to measure the tooth roughness. It is argued that there be a high probability for stiction between the clean silicon surfaces due to very high values of the friction force between the micro-conjunctions. On the other hand, the tooth surfaces having functionalized carbon-based layers are much less prone to stiction. However, due to wear of the functionalized coating the probability of stiction will start to increase. The results of the simulation for both the non-functionalized and functionalized micro-tooth surfaces (silicon-based MEMS surfaces) are presented...|$|R

In many structural applications, food industry requires steels {{not only with}} the ability to be easily <b>cleaned</b> <b>and</b> healthy but also with high mechanical properties. In this work high performance AISI 420 stainless steels were developed, improving bulk mechanical proprieties and surface characteristics such wear and corrosion resistance, the latter by different quenching techniques: laser quenching, induction quenching <b>and</b> <b>vacuum</b> quenching. Metallurgical characterization, tribological characterization, corrosion tests (polarization tests in H 2 SO 4, Na 2 SO 4 and NaCl solutions) have been used on treated and untreated AISI 420 steel. Results demonstrated that as expected all the three quenching techniques, due to the increase of surface hardness, highly improve wear resistance. Laser quenched <b>and</b> <b>vacuum</b> quenched samples present the best wear resistance, accompanied by a good corrosion resistance in all the solutions and conditions tested, while the induction quenching decreases the corrosion resistance even with respect to untreated material...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of <b>clean</b> <b>and</b> efficient high <b>vacuum</b> technologies to replace traditional methods for metallic or polymeric surfaces treatments to clean, deposit thin films, and functionalize surfaces, constitutes {{a very important}} area of research. The increasing concern regarding the {{development of}} environmentally friendly and sustainable technologies consists in an important objective in the modern world. In this context, cold plasma technology represents an efficient alternative, which has been object of increasing attention. In this work we evaluate the effect of plasma treatments on the removal of oil from aluminum surfaces. Furthermore, processes of deposition, and fine film activation, were studied on the surface previously cleaned. After a first plasma application to clean the oil contaminated aluminum surface, a thin film of HMDSO was deposited to achieve corrosion protection, and finally the deposited film was functionalized to obtain a surface with a higher energy, to favor adhesion to different polymers. The evaluation of the cleanness efficiency was conducted {{by means of the}} contact angle, and XPS. The nature of deposited and functionalized film was investigated using Fourier Transform Infra Red Spectroscopy (FTIR), angle of contact, and Scanning Electron Microscopy. A very significant reduction in the carbon content of the surfaces, was abserced. An increase in the surface energy of 95, 48 mN/m was obtained. Cleaning, corrosion protection and functionalization utilizing high vacuum technology can completely substitute wet processes associated with undesirable high environmental impact.
