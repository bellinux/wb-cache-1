Using this technique, <b>calibration</b> <b>standards</b> are prepared in identical sample matrix {{to that used}} for analysis (e.g. plasma) by spiking a normal sample with known concentrations of analyte. This is not always possible for biological samples, since the analyte of interest is often endogenously present in a clinically significant, albeit normal, quantity. For matrix matched <b>calibration</b> <b>standards</b> {{to be effective in}} compensating for ion suppression, the sample matrix must be free of the analyte of interest. Additionally, it is important that there is little variation in test sample composition since both the test sample and the prepared calibration sample must be affected in the same way by ion suppression.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis studies {{the feasibility of}} developing a closed-loop shipboard sensor calibration system with two main objectives. The first objective was {{to reduce the number}} of personnel required to calibrate a shipboard sensor by 50 %. The second was to reduce the time required to complete the calibration process by 60 %. This was achieved by displaying the sensor data and the <b>calibration</b> <b>standard</b> data on a tablet PC. Wireless technology was used to transmit the data from the sensor and the <b>calibration</b> <b>standard</b> to the tablet PC. The data from the sensor is sent via IEEE 802. 11 b wireless LAN using DataSocket protocol and the <b>calibration</b> <b>standard</b> is sent via Bluetooth protocol. The technology can be installed and used on current ships in the United States Navy. Four software programs were developed to accomplish these goals.
