40|$|Purpose: This study {{presents}} {{case studies}} of selected remanufacturing operations in Japan. It investigates Japanese companies' motives and incentives for remanufacturing, clarifies the requirements and obstacles facing remanufacturers, itemizes what measures companies take to address them, and discusses the influence of Japanese laws related to remanufacturing. Methods: This study involves {{case studies of}} four product areas: photocopiers, single-use cameras, auto parts, and ink and toner <b>cartridges</b> <b>for</b> <b>printers.</b> Results and conclusions {{are based on the}} authors' discussions and interviews with 11 remanufacturers [...] four original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and seven independent remanufacturers (IRs). In the discussions and the interviews, we asked the companies their motives for remanufacturing and asked the measures they take to overcome the obstacles of remanufacturing. This study highlighted three requirements for remanufacturing: (1) collection of used products, (2) efficient remanufacturing processes, and (3) demand for remanufactured products. Results: Where OEMs are the main remanufacturers of products covered by this study, their motives are long-term economic and environmental incentives. Where IRs are the main remanufacturers, it is often because OEMs shun remanufacturing, fearing to cannibalize new product sales. Companies' efforts to meet the above mentioned three requirements were observed and documented: (1) establishing a new collection channel; (2) developing reverse logistics to collect used products; (3) designing products for remanufacturing (DfReman); (4) accumulating know-how to establish remanufacturing processes; and (5) controlling product quality to stimulate demand for remanufactured products. This study also notes that (6) OEMs who engage in remanufacturing build consumer demand by incorporating remanufactured components into new products. This point has not been particularly noted in previous studies, but it has an important implication for OEMs' remanufacturing. The authors found that Japan's Home Appliances Recycling Law and End-of-Life Vehicle Law have promoted material recycling but have been insufficient to stimulate remanufacturing within the country. Conclusions: This study clarified the differences between OEMs' and IRs' remanufacturing. Both IRs and OEMs are important for remanufacturing. Institutional measures to encourage appropriate competition between OEMs and IRs and to enhance consumers' acceptance of remanufactured products is important to promote remanufacturing...|$|E

40|$|Current {{optimization}} {{methods for}} inventory management of toner <b>cartridges</b> <b>for</b> <b>printer</b> fleets typically focus on aggregate cartridge demand. However, {{with the development}} of printer technology, toner consumption algorithms are being developed which can accurately quantify the amount of toner that has been consumed over time, based on print job characteristics. This research introduces a dynamic inventory optimization approach for a fleet of printers over a rolling time horizon. Given, the consumption algorithm <b>for</b> the <b>printer</b> system, the cumulative toner consumed per cartridge per printer can be tracked. A forecasting method is developed which utilizes this toner consumption data <b>for</b> individual <b>printers</b> to forecast toner cartridge replacement times. Taking into account the uncertainty related to demand, demand forecast and lead time, an optimization model has been developed to determine the order placement times and order quantities to minimize the total cost subject to a specified service level. An experimental performance evaluation has been conducted on the parameters of the dynamic inventory management algorithm. Based on the results of this evaluation, the implementation of this dynamic inventory optimization methodology could {{have a positive impact on}} printer fleet management...|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Apollo {{introduced}} a revolutionary {{new pair of}} machines. The DN3000 and DN4000 used 68k processors, but were housed in IBM PC style cases {{of the time and}} had IBM-AT compatible ISA expansion slots and PC-compatible disk drives. These became the mainstay of the Apollo range in the mid to late 1980s. In principle, a user or third party could install a standard AT expansion card, but since this required the writing of a special device driver, in practice this was very rare. However, the size and design of the boxes made installing or replacing components very easy. A typical system could have between 2 MiB and 32 MiB of memory, a 76 MB, 150 MB or 330 MB (very occasionally 660 MB) hard disk, and 32-bit 68020 or 68030 processor running at 12 MHz to 33 MHz, depending on model. A half-height expansion bay could take either a 5¼-inch floppy disk drive or a QIC-type cartridge tape drive, capacity 30 MB, 45 MB, or 60 MB depending on <b>cartridge.</b> <b>For</b> <b>printer</b> access, the system came with a serial port as standard; a serial/parallel expansion card could provide a parallel printer port if this was required.|$|R
5000|$|In Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit {{ruled that}} {{circumvention}} {{of this technique}} does not violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The European Commission [...] also ruled this practice anticompetitive: it will disappear in newer models sold in the European Union. [...] While the DMCA case dealt with copyright protection, companies also rely on patent protection to prevent copying and refilling of <b>cartridges.</b> <b>For</b> example, if a company devises all {{of the ways in}} which their microchips can be manipulated and cartridges can be refilled and patents these methods, they can prevent anyone else from refilling their cartridges. Patents protecting the structure of their cartridges prevent the sale of cheaper copies of the <b>cartridges.</b> <b>For</b> some <b>printer</b> models (notably those from Canon) the manufacturer's own microchip can be removed and fitted to a compatible cartridge thereby avoiding the need to replicate the microchip (and risk prosecution). Other manufacturers embed their microchips deep within the cartridge in an effort to prevent this approach.|$|R
40|$|The toner {{cartridge}} manufacturing industry {{continues to grow}} at a rapid pace. This growth fuels the development of {{toner cartridge}} remanufacturing. While many remanufacturers of toner <b>cartridges</b> <b>for</b> laser <b>printers</b> replace the recycled organic photoconductive (OPC) drums with new aftermarket ones, others opt to reuse the recycled OPCs. The latter approach yields a savings to the remanufacturer in both material cost and waste, but since the condition of a used drum is unknown, tests must be performed on each individual OPC to determine its reusability. Typically, a recycled OPC is deemed reusable if it passes a visual inspection and/or yields an acceptable output in print testing. Unfortunately, neither of these methods produce quantitative measurements {{that can be used}} to objectively estimate the remaining life of the OPC. In this paper, a method based on a computerized OPC drum scanner for assessing the reusability of recycled OPCs is presented. The method, in conjunction with print testing, visual inspection, and historical data on the OPC type in consideration, has shown to be very effective in predicting the performance of recycled OPCs. Test results to support the validity of this method and its limitations will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was to {{describe}} consumers behaviour in the market with regards to print cartridges and to recommend the most suitable products {{to them on the}} basis of the established preferences and attributes. I used a questionnaire survey and a calculation of print cartridges parameter weights using the method of multi-criteria decision making. I found from the survey that the respondents mostly own ink multifunction equipment. Among the most commonly used printer makes are Hewlett Packard, Cannon and Epson. However, the proportion of less significant makes has dropped in the last three years. The respondents mostly buy original cartridges in shops and they buy black cartridges more often than colour cartridges. The main criteria for choosing a certain cartridge are price, quality and availability. The obtained information helped me select suitable <b>cartridges</b> <b>for</b> consumers. I found that cartridges are more readily available on the market in comparison to toners. When evaluating measurable attributes (price, quality and environmental friendliness) I calculated that in most cases it pays to buy renovated <b>cartridges,</b> especially <b>for</b> the evaluated <b>cartridge</b> from the makes HP and Canon and for toner makes HP and Epson. Epson cartridges contain a chip which prevents their renovation which is why I would recommend the purchase of a compatible <b>cartridge.</b> <b>For</b> the Canon toner I would recommend the purchase of a compatible cartridge too. In summary of my recommendations I would advise consumers to look closely at the price, volume, quality, producer and possibility to renovate when purchasing cartridges. I would further recommend buying ink printers as it is difficult to get <b>cartridges</b> <b>for</b> laser <b>printers.</b> I would point out that in most cases a rule applies: the cheaper the printer the more expensive the cartridge...|$|R

40|$|Clinical studies {{investigating}} {{medicinal products}} need {{to comply with}} laws concerning good clinical practice (GCP) and good manufacturing practice (GMP) to guarantee the quality and safety of the product, to protect {{the health of the}} participating individual and to assure proper performance of the study. However, there are no specific regulations or guidelines for non-Medicinal Investigational Products (non-MIPs) such as allergens, enriched food supplements, and air pollution components. As a consequence, investigators will avoid clinical research and prefer preclinical models or in vitro testing for e. g. toxicology studies. 1) briefly review the current guidelines and regulations for Investigational Medicinal Products; 2) present a standardised approach to ensure the quality and safety of non-MIPs in human in vivo research; and 3) discuss some lessons we have learned.
