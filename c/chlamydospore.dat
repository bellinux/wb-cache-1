500|$|The {{placement}} of the genus Rhodotus in the order Agaricales is uncertain, and various authors have offered solutions to the taxonomic conundrum. In 1951, Agaricales specialist Rolf Singer placed Rhodotus in the Amanitaceae because of similarities between the tribes Amaniteae and Rhodoteae, such as spore color and ornamentation (modifications of the spore wall that result in surface irregularities), structure of the hyphae and trama, and <b>chlamydospore</b> production during culture growth.In 1953, French mycologists [...] Robert Kühner and Henri Romagnesi placed Rhodotus in the family Tricholomataceae—a traditional [...] "wastebasket taxon"—on the basis of spore color. In 1969, Besson argued for the {{placement of}} Rhodotus with the Entolomataceae after studying the ultrastructure of the spores. By 1986, Singer had revised the placement of Rhodotus in his latest edition of The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, noting that [...] "It has formerly been inserted in the family Amanitaceae but is obviously closer to tribus Pseudohiatuleae of the Tricholomataceae." [...] Tribe Pseudohiatuleae included such genera as Flammulina, Pseudohiatula, Cyptotrama, and Callistodermatium. In 1988, a proposal was made to split the Tricholomataceae into several new families, including a family, Rhodotaceae, to contain the problematic genus.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chlamydospores</b> are asexual spores {{different}} from sporangiospores. The primary function of <b>chlamydospores</b> is {{the persistence of}} the mycelium and they are released when the mycelium degrades. <b>Chlamydospores</b> have no mechanism for dispersal.

50|$|A <b>chlamydospore</b> is the {{thick-walled}} big resting spore {{of several}} kinds of fungi, including Ascomycota such as Candida, Basidiomycota such as Panus., and various Mortierellales species. It is the life-stage which survives in unfavourable conditions, such as dry or hot seasons.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>chlamydospore,</b> P. cactorum also produces another asexual spore called a sporangia. A sporeangia is a multinucleate dispersal structure with a thin wall and papilla that is formed on a sporeangiophore. Although the size may vary based on the environmental conditions {{in which they are}} formed, the width of a sporeangia is always more than 2/3 times than its length. Depending on moisture conditions, sporangia can either germinate or release zoospores.|$|E
50|$|Phytophthora cactorum {{produces}} one sexually produced survival spore {{called an}} oospore, and one asexually produced survival spore called a <b>chlamydospore.</b> Oospores are double walled and uninucleate during dormancy, but become multinucleate {{in preparation for}} germination. In contrast, the chlamydospores have only one resistant wall and are multinucleate at all stages. Chlamydospores are larger than oospores in size, and are only formed under certain environmental triggers. The trigger for preferential formation of chamydospores over oospores can be either large temperature or moisture oscillations.|$|E

50|$|A. pullulans can be {{cultivated}} on potato dextrose agar, {{where it}} produces smooth, faint pink, yeast-like colonies {{covered with a}} slimy mass of spores. Older colonies change to black due to <b>chlamydospore</b> production. Primary conidia are hyaline, smooth, ellipsoidal, one-celled, and variable in shape and size; secondary conidia are smaller. Conidiophores are undifferentiated, intercalary or terminal, or arising as short lateral branches. Endoconidia are produced in an intercalary cell and released into a neighboring empty cell. Hyphae are hyaline, smooth, and thinwalled, with transverse septa. The fungus grows at 10-35 °C with optimum growth at 30 °C.|$|E

50|$|Several {{kinds of}} {{management}} {{exist for the}} prevention and suppression of disease. A cultural method that can be effective in preventing disease is sanitation. Equipment should be cleaned after use in infested fields so the disease does not spread into uninfested fields. To disrupt <b>chlamydospore</b> germination crops should be grown in drained disease free soil. Also, avoid transplanting without thorough knowledge of the transplant. To limit spread of structures limit traffic in infected fields and always clean after exposure. Disease is favored by pH values greater than 6.2, so lowering the pH is an effective method for preventing germination. pH management can be difficult because tobacco cannot survive in very low pH soils. Soil pH 5.5 to 6 allow successful growth of tobacco and control of disease. The cultural control, Crop rotation, is very effective at limiting disease. The longer an infected field is planted in a crop other than the initial infected crop, the lower the population will become. A minimum three year rotation is recommended. Crop rotation is recommended in combination with resistant varieties as genetic controls. Burley Tobacco, Burley Tobacco hybrids, and Dark Tobacco are varieties of tobacco that are resistant to Black Shank. Resistance however is not reliable because a single variety has resistance to only a few races of Black Shank. Finding new lines of resistance is becoming increasingly important due to new discovered resistant races of the pathogen. Chemical control is most successful if used with resistant varieties. Metalaxyl or mefenoxam are chemistries used to control Phytophthora nicotianae. Ridomil Gold is an example a systemic pesticide with a Metalaxyl chemistry. Mefenoxam is twice as active as metalaxyl, but they both have the same mode of action. Successful chemical control is difficult because we are limited to these two chemistries that are basically identical. A study by Csinos and Bertrand found out {{at a rate of}} 3.36 kg/ha would not inhibit many of the common races used in their study. Overall, from their study they observed that Black Shank severity was increasing in Georgia due to Metalaxyl sensitivity and resistant races of Black Shank.|$|E

40|$|<b>Chlamydospore</b> {{formation}} is {{a characteristic of}} many fungal species, among them the closely related human-pathogenic dimorphic yeasts Candida albicans and C. dubliniensis. Whereas function and regulation of filamentation are well-studied in these species, the basis of <b>chlamydospore</b> {{formation is}} mostly unknown. Here, we investigate the contribution of environmental and genetic factors and identified central proteins involved in species-specific regulation of chlamydosporulation. We show that specific nutrient levels strongly impact <b>chlamydospore</b> initiation, with starvation favoring sporulation and elevated levels of saccharides or peptone inhibiting it. Thresholds for these nutritional effects differ between C. albicans and C. dubliniensis, which explain species-specific <b>chlamydospore</b> formation on certain diagnostic media. A C. albicans nrg 1 Δ mutant phenocopied C. dubliniensis, putting Nrg 1 regulation at the basis of species-specific <b>chlamydospore</b> formation under various conditions. By screening a series of potential <b>chlamydospore</b> regulators, we identified the TOR and cAMP-pathways as crucial for sporulation. As rapamycin treatment blocked chlamydosporulation, a low basal Tor 1 activity seems to be essential. In addition, TOR effector pathways play an important role, and loss of the NCR (nitrogen catabolite repression) gene regulators Gat 1 and Gln 3 reduced <b>chlamydospore</b> formation. A severe reduction was seen for a C. albicans gcn 4 Δ deletion strain, implicating a link between regulation of amino acid biosynthesis and <b>chlamydospore</b> development. On the other hand, deletion of the GTPase gene RAS 1 and the adenylyl cyclase gene CYR 1 caused a defect in <b>chlamydospore</b> formation that was mostly rescued by cAMP supplementation. Thus, cAMP-signaling is a second major pathway to control <b>chlamydospore</b> production. Finally, we confirmed light exposure to have a repressive effect on chlamydosporulation. However, permanent illumination only reduced, but not abolished <b>chlamydospore</b> production of C. albicans whereas C. dubliniensis sporulation was unaffected. In summary, we describe novel environmental factors which determine chlamydosporulation and propose a first model for the regulatory network of <b>chlamydospore</b> formation by different Candida species...|$|E
40|$|The <b>chlamydospore</b> is a {{distinctive}} morphological {{feature of the}} fungal pathogenCandida albicans that can be induced to form in oxygen-limited environments and {{has been reported in}} clinical specimens. Chlamydospores are not produced by themodel yeastsSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, so there is limited understanding of the pathways that govern their development. Here, the results of a forward genetic approach that begins to define the genetic control of <b>chlamydospore</b> formation are described. Six genes – ISW 2, MDS 3, RIM 13, RIM 101, SCH 9 and SUV 3 – are required for efficient <b>chlamydospore</b> formation, based on the phenotypes of homozygous insertion mutants and reconstituted strains. Mutations in ISW 2, SCH 9 and SUV 3 completely abolish <b>chlamydospore</b> formation. Mutations in RIM 13, RIM 101 and MDS 3 delay normal <b>chlamydospore</b> formation. The involvement of alkaline pH-response regulators Rim 13 p and Mds 3 p in <b>chlamydospore</b> formation is unexpected {{in view of the fact}} that chlamydospores in the inducing conditions used here are repressed in alkaline media...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulation}} of morphogenesis {{in the human}} fungal pathogen Candida albicans is under investigation to better understand how the switch between budding and hyphal growth is linked to virulence. Therefore, {{in this study we}} examined the ability of C. albicans to undergo a distinct type of morphogenesis to form large thick-walled chlamydospores whose role in infection is unclear, but they act as a resting form in other species. During <b>chlamydospore</b> morphogenesis, cells switch to filamentous growth and then develop elongated suspensor cells that give rise to chlamydospores. These filamentous cells were distinct from true hyphae in that they were wider and were not inhibited by the quorum-sensing factor farnesol. Instead, farnesol increased <b>chlamydospore</b> production, indicating that quorum sensing can also have a positive role. Nuclear division did not occur across the necks of chlamydospores, as it does in budding. Interestingly, nuclei divided within the suspensor cells, and then one daughter nucleus subsequently migrated into the <b>chlamydospore.</b> Septins were not detected near mitotic nuclei but were localized at <b>chlamydospore</b> necks. At later stages, septins localized throughout the <b>chlamydospore</b> plasma membrane and appeared to form long filamentous structures. Deletion of the CDC 10 or CDC 11 septins caused greater curvature of cells growing in a filamentous manner and morphological defects in suspensor cells and chlamydospores. These studies identify aspects of <b>chlamydospore</b> morphogenesis that are distinct from bud and hyphal morphogenesis...|$|E

40|$|Formation of chlamydospores by Candida albicans was an {{established}} medical diagnostic test to confirm candidiasis before the molecular era. However, the functional role and pathological relevance {{of this in}} vitro morphological transition to pathogenesis in vivo remain unclear. We compared the physical properties of in vitro-induced chlamydospores with those of large C. albicans cells purified by density gradient centrifugation from Candida infected mouse kidneys. The morphological and physical properties of these cells in kidneys of mice infected intravenously with wild type C. albicans confirmed that chlamydospores can form in infected kidneys. A previously reported chlamydospore-null Δisw 2 / Δisw 2 mutant was used to investigate its role in virulence and <b>chlamydospore</b> induction. Virulence of the Δisw 2 /Δisw 2 mutant strain was reduced 3. 4 -fold compared to wild type C. albicans or the ISW 2 reconstituted strain. Altered host inflammatory reactions to the null mutant further indicate that ISW 2 is a virulence factor in C. albicans. ISW 2 deletion abolished <b>chlamydospore</b> formation within infected mouse kidneys, whereas the reconstituted strain restored <b>chlamydospore</b> formation in kidneys. Under <b>chlamydospore</b> inducing conditions in vitro, deletion of ISW 2 significantly delayed <b>chlamydospore</b> formation, and those late induced chlamydospores lacked associated suspensor cells while attaching laterally to hyphae via novel spore-hypha septa. Our findings establish the induction of chlamydospores by C. albicans during mouse kidney colonization. Our results indicate that ISW 2 is not strictly required for chlamydospores formation but is necessary for suspensor cell formation. The importance of ISW 2 in <b>chlamydospore</b> morphogenesis and virulence may lead to additional insights into morphological differentiation and pathogenesis of C. albicans in the host microenvironment...|$|E
