The mass of each size fraction is determined gravimetrically. The California Air Resources Board Method 501 is currently the most widely accepted test method for particle size distribution emissions measurements.|$|R

A multi-cascade is a discrete multi-valued dynamic system with the translation semigroup (Z⩾ 0,+). The <b>cascade</b> search <b>principle</b> <b>using</b> so-called search functionals is suggested. It gives a solution of the problem. Also, an estimation is obtained for the distance between any initial point x and every correspondent limit point. Several applications of one-valued and multi-valued versions of the mentioned cascade search principle are given for the cases when the limit subset A is (1) the full (or expanded) preimage of a closed subspace under a mapping from X to another metric space; (2) the coincidence set (or expanded coincidence set) of n mappings from X to another metric space (n> 1); (3) the common preimage (or the expanded one) of a closed subspace under n mappings; and (4) the common fixed point set of n mappings of the space X into itself (n⩾ 1). Generalizations of the previous authors results are obtained. And, in particular cases, generalizations of some recent results by A. V. Arutyunov on coincidences of two mappings and a generalization of Banach fixed point principle are obtained...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cascading</b> <b>use</b> {{of biomass}} is a {{recognized}} strategy contributing to an efficient development of the bioeconomy and for mitigating climate change. This study aims at assessing the potential of <b>cascading</b> <b>use</b> of woody biomass for reducing GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions and increasing the overall wood flow efficiency in the European Union's forest and bioeconomy sectors. A scenario and life cycle approach was followed to quantify {{the potential benefits of}} <b>cascading</b> <b>use</b> of woody biomass. We started from a reference scenario in which (post-consumer) waste wood and paper are re-utilized for energy only (S 0). Then we compared the reference scenario with two alternative scenarios, the current waste wood and paper recycling practices (S 1) and the maximum technical potential to increase recycling of waste wood and paper flows (S 2). Following a supply chain perspective, different stages of production were analysed, including forgone fossil-fuels substitution, optimization at manufacturing level and forest regrowth. Through <b>cascading</b> <b>use,</b> the wood <b>use</b> efficiency ratio (<b>cascade</b> factor) in the European wood sector would be increased by 23 % (S 0 vs S 1) and 31 % (S 0 vs S 2) and GHG emissions (cradle-to-gate energy use) would be reduced by 42 % (28 MtCO 2 -eq/year) and 52 % (35 MtCO 2 -eq/year) in scenarios S 1 and S 2. However, increased wood product cascading is counter effected in the short term by reduced savings in the energy sector by 49 % and 48 % (− 43 and − 42 MtCO 2 -eq/year) in scenarios S 1 and S 2 due to delayed availability of waste wood and waste paper fibers. This explorative study highlights the potential of <b>cascading</b> <b>use</b> of woody biomass in the wood production chains to contribute to a reduction of environmental impacts related to wood resource and energy use, but it also reveals trade-offs in terms of GHG emissions reduction, relevant especially in meeting short-term (2020 – 2030) renewable energy targets...|$|R

Thus feeding biochar to livestock has numerous benefits not only for the animals, but it also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improves nutrient retention in animal manure. The use of biochar in building materials is just beginning to be studied but shows promise in the ability to insulate, decontaminate air, provide odor and humidity control. Biochar as pillow filling to induce perfectly reposing sleep is just another way to benefit from biochar 2 ̆ 7 s multiple qualities. There are more than 55 uses of biochar that can all be combined in cascades.
