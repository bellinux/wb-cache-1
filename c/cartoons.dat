We succeed in transferring the <b>cartoon</b> image retrieval problem to sequences comparison. Thus the computational complexity is decreased obviously.

While the Disney shorts had dominated the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (<b>Cartoons)</b> during the 1930s, its reign over the award had been ended by MGM's Tom and Jerry <b>cartoons,</b> Warner Bros' Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, and the works of United Productions of America (UPA), whose flat art style and stylized animation techniques were lauded as more modern alternatives to the older Disney style.

5|$|Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen {{described}} the controversy as Denmark's worst international relations incident since the Second World War. The incident {{came at a}} time of heightened political and social tensions between Muslim majority countries and Western countries, following several, high-profile Islamic terrorist attacks in the Westincluding the September 11 attacksand Western military interventions in Muslim countries, such as Iraq and Afghanistan. The <b>cartoons</b> and the reaction to them aggravated already-strained relations. The relationship between Muslims in Denmark and the broader society was similarly at a low-point, and the conflict came to symbolise the misunderstandings between the Islamic community and the rest of society. In the years since, terrorist plots claiming to be in retaliation for the <b>cartoons</b> have been planned, and some executed, against targets affiliated with newspapers that published the <b>cartoons</b> or Denmark.|$|E
