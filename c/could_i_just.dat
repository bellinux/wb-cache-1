60|$|MURRAY. I didn't mean--anything like that. I know you've been frank. But him--I don't know him. How <b>could</b> <b>I,</b> <b>just</b> {{meeting him}} once? He {{may be quite}} {{different}} from my idea. That's what I'm getting at. I don't want to be unfair to him.|$|E

[...] "I {{should like to}} come up and see the Hall, at any rate, but in the meantime, as we are here, <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> look over the inside of this little place? I found the large shed where the {{lifeboat}} used to be kept, locked up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mrs. Barry, {{please forgive}} me. I {{did not mean}} to--to--intoxicate Diana. How <b>could</b> <b>I?</b> <b>Just</b> imagine {{if you were a}} poor little orphan girl that kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom friend in all the world. Do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose? I thought it was only {{raspberry}} cordial. I was firmly convinced it was raspberry cordial. Oh, please don't say that you won't let Diana play with me any more. If you do you will cover my life with a dark cloud of woe." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Gummy,' thinks I, 'here's a fix!' Niggers? At first I couldn't see {{anything}} {{for it but}} Stifle below or Stabs above. I didn't properly understand how much air there was to last me, but I didn't feel like standing very much more of it down below. I was hot and frightfully heady--quite apart from the blue funk I was in. We'd never repined with these beastly natives, filthy Papuan beasts. It wasn't any good, coming up where I was, but I had to do something. On {{the spur of the}} moment, I clambered {{over the side of the}} brig and landed among the weeds, and set off through the darkness as fast as I <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> stopped once and knelt, and twisted back my head in the helmet and had a look up. It was a most extraordinary bright green-blue above, and the two canoes and the boat floating there very small and distant like a kind of twisted H. And it made me feel sick to squint up at it, and think what the pitching and swaying of the three meant.|$|E
30|$|Initially, I {{found these}} sudden {{injunctions}} disruptive and annoying. How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> {{pick up and}} leave, not even knowing where I was going or for how long I would be away? After months of practice, however, I realized that her summons was a valuable teaching. Not only did I get to see many wonderful temples and meet extraordinary people, but Shihfu’s call taught me to stay alert in the moment and {{to be ready for}} anything. It taught me both nonattachment and flexibility.|$|E
