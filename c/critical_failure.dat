He returned to Harvard University to finish his studies, but eventually dropped out to focus on songwriting. During this time, Cuomo played with a different group of musicians in the band Homie, based in Boston. One {{of the members of}} Homie was Mikey Welsh, a bass player who would eventually be asked to replace Matt Sharp in Weezer.|$|E

50|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} need the safety systems to avoid mission <b>critical</b> <b>failures.</b> The worst {{possible}} consequence {{that can result}} is leakage of radioactive materials (U-235 or Pu-239). One of the systems to avoid mission <b>critical</b> <b>failures</b> for nuclear power plant is shutdown system. It has two different forms: rod controls and safety injection control. When problem occurs in the nuclear power plant, the rod control shutdown system drops the rods automatically and stops the chain reaction. The safety injection control injects liquid immediately when the system faces the problem in nuclear reactor and stops the chain reaction. Both systems are usually automatically operated, but also can be manually activated.|$|R
5|$|While filming Silver Streak, Wilder {{began working}} on a script for The World's Greatest Lover, {{inspired}} by Fellini's The White Sheik. Wilder wrote, produced, and directed The World's Greatest Lover, which premièred in 1977, but was a <b>critical</b> <b>failure.</b> The Frisco Kid (1979) was Wilder's next project. The film was to star John Wayne, but he dropped out {{and was replaced by}} Harrison Ford, then an up-and-coming actor.|$|E
5|$|In {{support of}} this album, Bowie {{embarked}} on the Glass Spider Tour, a world tour that {{was at that point}} the biggest, most theatrical and most elaborate tour he had undertaken in his career. The tour, like the album it supported, was commercially successful but critically panned. The <b>critical</b> <b>failure</b> of the album and tour were factors that led Bowie to look for a new way to motivate himself creatively, leading him to create the band Tin Machine in 1989 and to retire his back catalogue from live performances during his 1990 Sound+Vision Tour. Bowie did not release another solo album until Black Tie White Noise in 1993.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, as a {{contract}} player for Paramount Pictures, Baker became a sex symbol after appearing as a hedonistic widow in The Carpetbaggers (1964). The film's producer, Joseph E. Levine, cast {{her in the}} potboiler Sylvia before giving her the role of Jean Harlow in the biopic Harlow (1965). Despite significant prepublicity, Harlow was a <b>critical</b> <b>failure,</b> and Baker relocated to Italy in 1966 amid a legal dispute over her contract with Paramount and Levine's overseeing of her career. In Europe, she spent the next 10 years starring in hard-edged Italian thriller and horror films, including Umberto Lenzi's Paranoia (1969) and Knife of Ice (1972), before re-emerging for American audiences as a character actress in the Andy Warhol-produced dark comedy Bad (1977).|$|E

5|$|Kono's {{inspiration}} for the first Clock Tower title came from watching Italian film director Dario Argento's horror films, especially his film Phenomena (1985). The game began as an experimental project with a low budget and small staff. It sold well enough to prompt a direct sequel which competed with Capcom's Resident Evil (1996). The third game in the series was not directed by Kono and was a <b>critical</b> <b>failure.</b> Human Entertainment {{went out of business}} in 2000, after which Sunsoft purchased the Clock Tower intellectual property. They would go on to develop Clock Tower 3 with Capcom which was a commercial failure.|$|E
5|$|The first talkies {{shown in}} the Indies, Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 and The Rainbow Man (both 1929), came from the United States and were {{screened}} in late 1929. This encouraged Krugers to make Karnadi Anemer Bangkong (Karnadi the Frog Contractor), an adaptation of the book by Yuhana, in 1930. The comedy, made with a single system camera that Krugers had obtained {{with the help of}} his Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers membership, is generally thought the first locally produced talkie released in the country, but had poor technical quality. It was a <b>critical</b> <b>failure,</b> as the majority Sundanese audience felt that they were being insulted; contemporary director Joshua Wong suggested that this poor reception was partly owing to the main character eating a frog, something which is forbidden for Muslims.|$|E
5|$|The {{play was}} first {{produced}} in 1934 in Los Angeles {{under the title}} Woman on Trial; it received positive reviews and enjoyed moderate commercial success. Producer Al Woods took it to Broadway during the 1935–36 season and re-titled it Night of January 16th. It drew attention for its innovative audience-member jury and became a hit, running for seven months. Doris Nolan, in her Broadway debut, received positive criticism for her portrayal of the lead role. Several regional productions followed. An off-Broadway revival in 1973, under the title Penthouse Legend, was a commercial and <b>critical</b> <b>failure.</b> A film based on the play was released in 1941; the story has also been adapted for television and radio.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} evaluation of two software implemented error detection and system recovery mechanisms that protect a prototype brake-by-wire controller from soft errors. We used an eval-uation driven design process to develop the software mechanisms, which are specifically designed to prevent soft errors from causing <b>critical</b> <b>failures</b> in the brake controller. The design process involves 1) identifying vulnerable parts of the brake controller, 2) designing and verifying software mechanisms for error detection and recovery, and 3) performing an extensive evalua-tion of the proposed mechanisms. Results from error injection experiments in the last step show that our simple software mechanisms, combined with hardware exceptions for error detection, can effectively {{reduce the number of}} <b>critical</b> <b>failures</b> caused by soft errors in the brake controller. 1...|$|R

5|$|Checkmate is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Focusing {{on the subject of}} convictions by circumstantial evidence, the plot has a French baron and an American businessman vie for the affections of an heiress. She chooses the American and the French baron conspires with the heiress's aunt to take revenge. The American falls into their trap and is accused of stabbing the baron by the conspirators. The circumstantial evidence was enough to convict him and he is sent to prison. Through the aid of a homeless doppelgänger who looks like the fiancé, he is substituted in prison and the original forces a confession from the aunt. For his plot, the baron is convicted of perjury and sent to prison. Released on February 17, 1911, the film was a <b>critical</b> <b>failure</b> for its improbable plot and its prison substitution scene. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Prospects for a {{successful}} release did not look good. Aykroyd and Belushi had left SNL {{at the end of}} the previous season, reducing their bankability. Belushi's fame had taken a further hit after the commercial and <b>critical</b> <b>failure</b> of 1941 {{at the end of the}} year. One day after the editing was done, Wasserman invited Landis up to his office to speak with Ted Mann, head of the Mann Theatres chain, which dominated film exhibition in the Western United States. He told Landis that he would not book the film at any theaters in predominantly white neighborhoods, such as Westwood. Not only did Mann not want black patrons going there to see the film, he surmised that white viewers were unlikely to see a film featuring older black musical stars. Ultimately The Blues Brothers got less than half the bookings nationwide for its initial release than a typical big-budget studio film of the era, which did not bode well for its success at the box office.|$|E

The Game Master may decide in such cases that, in first case (a roll of 18, or 10+ over the modified skill level), the character has failed miserably and caused something disastrous to happen or, in the other case, that he or she succeeds incredibly well and gains some benefit as a result.|$|E
