It recirculated, rather than merely cooled, the air inside the vehicle, {{and it was also}} the highest <b>capacity</b> <b>unit</b> available on an automobile. It was also simple to operate, with a single switch on the dashboard marked with low, medium, and high positions, which the driver selected as desired. The system was capable of cooling a Chrysler from 120 degrees to 85 degrees in about two minutes, and of completely eliminating humidity, dust, pollen and tobacco smoke at the same time. Since it relied on fresh air, and drew in sixty percent more of it than any contemporary system, Airtemp avoided the staleness associated with automotive air conditioning at the time. It was silent and unobtrusive. Instead of plastic tubes mounted on the package shelf as on GM and on other cars, small ducts directed cool air toward the ceiling of the car where it filtered down around the passengers instead of blowing directly on them, a feature that modern cars have lost.|$|E
2500|$|The E-7 was {{the next}} major {{production}} variant, entering service and seeing combat {{at the end of}} August 1940. One of the limitations of the earlier Bf 109Es was their short range of 660km (410mi) and limited endurance, as the design was originally conceived as a short-range interceptor. The E-7 rectified this problem as it was the first Bf 109 subtype to be able to carry a drop tank, usually the standardized Luftwaffe 300 L (80 US gal) <b>capacity</b> <b>unit</b> mounted on a centre-line rack under the fuselage, which increased its range to 1,325km (820mi). Alternatively, a bomb could be fitted and the E-7 {{could be used as a}} Jabo [...] fighter-bomber. Previous Emil subtypes were progressively retrofitted with the necessary fittings for carrying a drop tank from October 1940. Early E-7s were fitted with the 1,100PS DB 601A or 1,175PS DB 601Aa engine, while late-production ones received 1,175PS DB 601N engines with improved altitude performance – the latter was designated as E-7/N.

30|$|At the {{beginning}} of his engagement in 2008, the investor takes decisions on capacity adjustment at the three production locations that are continued from the initial configuration. Whereas technical and personnel capacity of both locations in Lahr und Hemer is extended (starting from 1 Mio. <b>capacity</b> <b>units</b> before the acquisition) during the planning horizon by 0.2 Mio. <b>capacity</b> <b>units</b> per year, <b>capacity</b> downsizing is chosen for the production location in Porta Westfalica (minus 0.2 Mio. <b>capacity</b> <b>units</b> per year). The latter adjustment lasts for 3  years until the location is liquidated {{at the end of the}} investor’s engagement (i.e., the end of 2010). According to the demand expected for the products offered by the sanitary supply chain, the investor decides to open a new distribution location in Volketswil with constant capacities (i.e., 2 Mio. <b>capacity</b> <b>units</b> are additionally available) at {{the beginning}} of 2008, which supplements the stagnating storage capacity (2 Mio. <b>capacity</b> <b>units)</b> of the existing distribution location in Porta Westfalica. Hence, the sanitary company is able to meet the demand at all markets in all time periods completely. For providing essential raw materials, the supplier in Plettenberg is to be used throughout the whole planning horizon. The deliveries are complemented by the supplier in Hettstedt during the year 2009.|$|R

40|$|Communication over a noisy {{channel is}} often {{conducted}} in a setting in which different input symbols to the channel incur a certain cost. For example, for the additive white Gaussian noise channel, the cost associated with a real number input symbol is the square of its magnitude. In such a setting, it is often useful to know {{the maximum amount of}} information that can be reliably transmitted per cost incurred. This is known as the <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost. In this paper, we generalize the <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost to various communication tasks involving a quantum channel; in particular, we consider classical communication, entanglement-assisted classical communication, private communication, and quantum communication. For each task, we define the corresponding <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost and derive a formula for it analogous to that of the usual capacity. Furthermore, for the special case {{in which there is a}} zero-cost quantum state, we obtain expressions for the various <b>capacities</b> per <b>unit</b> cost in terms of an optimized relative entropy involving the zero-cost state. For each communication task, we construct an explicit pulse-position-modulation coding scheme that achieves the <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost. Finally, we compute <b>capacities</b> per <b>unit</b> cost for various quantum Gaussian channels and introduce the notion of a blocklength-constrained <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost.

50|$|The {{history of}} the Cortina Lotus began in 1961. Colin Chapman had been wishing to build his own engines for Lotus, mainly because the Coventry Climax unit was so expensive. Colin Chapman's chance came when he {{commissioned}} Harry Mundy (a close friend and designer of the Coventry Climax engine and technical editor for Autocar) to design a twin-cam version of the Ford Kent engine. Most {{of the development of}} the engine was done on the 997cc and 1,340cc bottom end, but in 1962 Ford released the 116E five bearing 1,499 cc engine and work centred on this. Keith Duckworth, from Cosworth, played an important part in tuning of the engine. The engine's first appearance was in 1962 at the Nürburgring in a Lotus 23 driven by Jim Clark. Almost as soon as the engine appeared in production cars (Lotus Elan), it was replaced with a larger <b>capacity</b> <b>unit</b> (82.55 mm bore to give 1,557 cc).

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{capacity}} and <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost of Gaussian multiple access-channel (GMAC) with peak power constraints. We first devise an approach based on Blahut-Arimoto Algorithm to numerically optimize the sum rate and quantify the corresponding input distributions. The results reveal {{that in the}} case with identical peak power constraints, the user with higher SNR is to have a symmetric antipodal input distribution for all values of noise variance. Next, we analytically derive and characterize an achievable rate region for the capacity in cases with small peak power constraints, which coincides with the capacity in a certain scenario. The <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost is of interest in low power regimes and is a target performance measure in energy efficient communications. In this work, we derive the <b>capacity</b> per <b>unit</b> cost of additive white Gaussian channel and GMAC with peak power constraints.
