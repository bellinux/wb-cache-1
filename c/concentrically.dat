5|$|The {{fruit body}} is a {{medium-sized}} mushroom, with a cap 6–10cm (2.5–4in) in diameter, though larger specimens occasionally reach 15cm (6in). The cap is initially hemispherical before flattening with maturity, and has a broad, shallow umbo. The cap margin is initially curled inwards but uncurls as it matures. The cap surface is silvery-grey and covered with <b>concentrically</b> patterned darker scales of a grey, brown or blackish colour that grow paler toward the cap margin, Secretan noting its resemblance to the cap of Sarcodon imbricatus. The gills are free (unattached to the stalk), white and thick, may have a yellow or greenish tint, and may drip water, as may {{the top of the}} stalk when broken. With age, the gill edges can become jagged and rough. The gill spacing is rather variable, ranging from distant to crowded; typically, between 100–120 gills extend fully from the stalk {{to the edge of the}} cap, with a variable number of lamellulae (shorter gills not extending fully from stalk to cap margin).|$|E

25|$|The last {{statement}} {{means that}} the termini of the sequences of iterations generated by the points of Fi are either precisely the same set, which is then a finite cycle, or they are finite cycles of circular or annular shaped sets that are lying <b>concentrically.</b> In the first case the cycle is attracting, in the second it is neutral.|$|E
25|$|The shield is oblong, {{about one}} third of the total length of the animal. The shield is rounded in front, angular behind, and forming an angle of about 80 degrees when in motion, usually of a similar tint to the body, but boldly marbled or maculate with black, {{somewhat}} <b>concentrically</b> and interruptedly ridged around a sub-posterior nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Physicist Domokos Tar {{suggested}} the following theory for ball lightning formation {{based on his}} ball lightning observation. Lightning strikes perpendicular to the ground, and thunder follows immediately at supersonic speed {{in the form of}} shock waves that form an invisible aerodynamic turbulence ring horizontal to the ground. Around the ring, over and under pressure systems rotate the vortex around a circular axis in the cross section of the torus. At the same time, the ring expands <b>concentrically</b> parallel to the ground at low speed.|$|E
25|$|During {{the same}} period, between 1779 and 1782, Arnold {{finalized}} {{the form of}} his chronometer watches. Through continuous experimentation, he worked {{out a way to}} make an effective but simple form of compensation balance. At the same time, he discovered a simple modification to his helical balance spring that let develop <b>concentrically</b> and, also, confer the property of isochronism on the oscillating balance. Not only this, but adjustments to the compensation balance and the balance spring could be carried out in a simple, calculated way. These were the main subjects of the patent, which he took out in 1782.|$|E
25|$|In DCTs {{where the}} two {{clutches}} are arranged <b>concentrically,</b> the larger outer clutch drives the odd-numbered gears and the smaller inner clutch drives the even-numbered gears. Shifts can be accomplished without interrupting torque distribution to the driven roadwheels, by applying the engine's torque to one clutch {{at the same time}} as it is being disconnected from the other clutch. Since alternate gear ratios can preselect an odd gear on one gear shaft while the vehicle is being driven in an even gear (and vice versa), DCTs are the fastest-shifting road car transmission available and are even able to shift faster than a professional racing driver using a manual transmission. DCTs can even shift more quickly than cars equipped with single-clutch automated-manual transmissions (AMTs), also called single-clutch semiautomatics. Also, with a DCT, shifts can be made more smoothly than with a single-clutch AMT, making a DCT more suitable for conventional road cars.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s {{abstract}} painting {{continued to}} develop in America through varied styles. Geometric abstraction, Op art, hard-edge painting, Color Field painting and minimal painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting {{as well as some}} other new movements. Morris Louis (see gallery) was an important pioneer in advanced Colorfield painting, his work can serve as a bridge between Abstract expressionism, Colorfield painting, and Minimal Art. Two influential teachers Josef Albers and Hans Hofmann introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. Josef Albers is best remembered for his work as an Geometric abstractionist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series Homage to the Square, (see gallery). In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged <b>concentrically</b> on the canvas. Albers' theories on art and education were formative {{for the next generation of}} artists. His own paintings form the foundation of both hard-edge painting and Op art.|$|E
500|$|Pot broaches are cut {{the inverse}} of an {{internal}} broach; they cut the outside diameter of a cylindrical workpiece. They are named after the pot looking fixture in which the broaches are mounted; the fixture {{is often referred to}} as a [...] "pot". The pot is designed to hold multiple broaching tools <b>concentrically</b> over its entire length. The broach is held stationary while the workpiece is pushed or pulled through it. This has replaced hobbing for some involute gears and cutting external splines and slots.|$|E
500|$|Caps can be dull to very colourful, {{the latter}} {{especially}} in Russula; their size ranges from 17mm diameter {{or less in}} Russula campinensis to [...] in Lactifluus vellereus. <b>Concentrically</b> ringed (zonate) caps occur in all Multifurca and several Lactarius species. Laterally stiped (pleurotoid) fruitbodies exist in some, mainly tropical Lactifluus and Russula species. Taste is a distinguishing characteristic in many species, from mild to very acrid. A conspicuous feature of the [...] "milk-caps" [...] in Lactarius, Lactifluus, and Multifurca furcata is the latex or [...] "milk" [...] their fruitbodies exude when bruised.|$|E
500|$|Daedaleopsis confragosa, {{commonly}} known as the thin walled maze polypore or the blushing bracket, is a species of polypore fungus in the family Polyporaceae. A plant pathogen, it causes a white rot of injured hardwoods, especially willows. The fruit bodies are semicircular and tough, have a <b>concentrically</b> zoned brownish upper surface, and measure up to [...] in diameter. The whitish underside turns gray-brown as the fruit body ages, but bruises pink or red. It is found all year and is common in northern temperate woodlands of eastern North America, Europe, and Asia. The species was first described from Europe in 1791 as a form of Boletus, and has undergone several changes of genus in its taxonomic history. It acquired its current name when Joseph Schröter transferred it to Daedaleopsis in 1888.|$|E
500|$|On {{the flank}} of the volcano, apatite, hematite, and {{magnetite}} deposits are found at altitudes of [...] The volcano is mainly known for these flows. The deposits lie on top of flat lava flows of andesitic composition, <b>concentrically</b> around Pico Laco. They are named Laco Norte, Laco Sur, San Vicente Alto, and San Vicente Bajo. The deposits consist of dykes, hydrothermal deposits, lava flows, pyroclastics, and subvolcanic structures and were erupted from parasitic vents and fissures. The magnetite is classified as porphyry-like. Apatite is present as an accessory mineral in the lavas and is abundant in the intrusions. Iron-rich zones also formed in tuffs and lavas. Magnetite in the subvolcanic bodies exists in more massive crystals. The iron-containing rocks include lava flows, ash, and lapilli, as well as ore breccias. The El Laco magnetite lava flows are unique {{in the world and}} formed during active subduction.|$|E

2500|$|Where {{allowed by}} geography, Chinese city walls are {{rectangular}} in shape, with four orthogonal walls. Some wall systems {{are composed of}} a number of such rectangles, set adjacent to or <b>concentrically</b> within each other. For example, the city wall of Beijing is composed of four rectangles: a wider outer city to the south, a narrower inner city to the north, an imperial city within the inner city, and the Forbidden City at the centre of that.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1965, Ranger 8 swept {{an oblique}} course {{over the south}} of Oceanus Procellarum and Mare Nubium, to crash in Mare Tranquillitatis about [...] distant from where Apollo 11 would land 4½ years later.

Its 5,800 images, nested <b>concentrically</b> and taking advantage of very low-level sunlight, provided strong confirmation of the crater-on-crater, gently rolling contours of the lunar surface.|$|E
2500|$|Archimedes first derived {{this formula}} {{from the fact}} that the {{projection}} to the lateral surface of a circumscribed cylinder is area-preserving.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} changes between the original and the second version of the Art was in the visuals used. The early version used 16 figures presented as complex, complementary trees, while the system of the Ars Magna featured only four, including one which combined the other three. This figure, a [...] "Lullian Circle," [...] took the form of a paper machine operated by rotating <b>concentrically</b> arranged circles to combine his symbolic alphabet, which was repeated on each level. These combinations were said to show all possible truth about the subject of inquiry. Llull based this notion on the idea that there were a limited number of basic, undeniable truths in all fields of knowledge, and that everything about these fields of knowledge could be understood by studying combinations of these elemental truths.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{variant of}} the DSG went into series {{production}} in 2008—the DQ200. [...] This unit has seven forward ratios, but the notable difference over the original DQ250 is the change from wet to dry clutches. This variant uses two single-plate dry clutches, arranged in a tandem design (instead of <b>concentrically)</b> and therefore similar in size. The DQ200 is again for use in transverse applications, but is intended for use in smaller cars, with smaller-displacement engines that generate relatively low torque outputs. [...] When used in the latest Golf with the [...] engine, this new seven-speed DSG uses roughly 6% (5.9l/100km for the seven-speed DSG compared to 6.3l/100km with the six-speed manual gearbox) less fuel than the same engine with a manual transmission and up to 20% less than a conventional automatic transmission.

2500|$|Beijing is {{connected}} by road links to {{all parts of}} China {{as part of the}} National Trunk Road Network. Nine expressways of China serve Beijing, as do eleven China National Highways. Beijing's urban transport is dependent upon the five [...] "ring roads" [...] that <b>concentrically</b> surround the city, with the Forbidden City area marked as the geographical centre for the ring roads. The ring roads appear more rectangular than ring-shaped. There is no official [...] "1st Ring Road". The 2nd Ring Road is located in the inner city. Ring roads tend to resemble expressways progressively as they extend outwards, with the 5th and 6th Ring Roads being full-standard national expressways, linked to other roads only by interchanges. Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the 3rd Ring Road outward. A final outer orbital, the Capital Ring Expressway (G95), is being built and will extend into neighboring Tianjin and Hebei.|$|E

They surrender at once without a struggle, and unconditionally; the chamfers deepen and multiply themselves, cover the soffit, ally themselves with other forms resulting from grouped shafts or traceries, and settle into the inextricable richness of the fully developed Gothic jamb and arch; farther complicated in the end by the addition of niches to their recesses, as above described.|$|E

6000|$|... 48. {{the turning}} sphere. For poetical {{purposes}} Milton everywhere adopts the popular astronomy of his day, {{which was based}} on the ancient, i.e. the Ptolemaic, or geocentric system of the universe. Copernicus had already taught the modern, heliocentric theory of the solar system, and his innovations were not unknown to Milton, who, however, consistently adheres to the old conceptions. In Milton, therefore, we find the earth the centre of the visible universe, while the sun, the planets, and the fixed stars revolve about it in their several spheres. These spheres are nine in number, arranged <b>concentrically,</b> like the coats of an onion, about the earth, and, if of solid matter, are to be conceived as being of perfectly transparent crystal. Beginning with the innermost, they present themselves in the following order: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the Fixed Stars, the Primum Mobile. In Par. Lost III 481, the ninth sphere appears as [...] "that crystalline sphere whose balance weighs the trepidation talked," [...] and the Primum Mobile, or the first moved, becomes the tenth and outermost of the series. The last two spheres contain no stars.|$|E
60|$|The lava where {{first met}} with is 130 feet in thickness: it there {{consists}} of two, three, or perhaps more streams, divided {{from each other}} by vesicular spheroids like those on the surface. From the streams having, as it appears, extended to different distances, the terminal points are of unequal heights. Generally {{the surface of the}} basalt is smooth them in one part high up the valley, it was so uneven and hummocky, that until I afterwards saw the streams extending continuously {{on both sides of the}} valley up to a height of about three thousand feet close to the Cordillera, I thought that the craters of eruption were probably close at hand. This hummocky surface I believe to have been caused by the crossing and heaping up of different streams. In one place, there were several rounded ridges about twenty feet in height, some of them as broad as high, and some broader, which certainly had been formed whilst the lava was fluid, for in transverse sections each ridge was seen to be <b>concentrically</b> laminated, and to be composed of imperfect columns radiating from common centres, like the spokes of wheels.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} June, {{we started}} for the {{northern}} or Assam face of the mountains. The road runs between the extensive and populous native village, or poonji, on the left, and a deep valley on the right, and commands a beautiful view of more waterfalls. Beyond this it ascends steeply, and the sandstone on the road itself is curiously divided into parallelograms, like hollow bricks,* [I have seen similar bricks in the sandstones of the coal-districts of Yorkshire; they are very puzzling, and are probably due to some very obscure crystalline action analogous to jointing and cleavage.] enclosing irregularly shaped nodules, while in other places {{it looks as if}} it had been run or fused: spherical concretions of sand, coloured <b>concentrically</b> by infiltration, are common in it, which have been regarded as seeds, shells, etc.; it also contained spheres of iron pyrites. The general appearance of much of this rock is {{as if it had been}} bored by Teredines (ship worms), but I never detected any trace of fossils. It is often beautifully ripple-marked, and in some places much honeycombed, and full of shales and narrow seams of coal, resting on a white under-clay full of root-fibres, like those of Stigmaria.|$|E
6000|$|... § III. When the eye falls casually {{on a map}} of Europe, {{there is}} no feature by which {{it is more likely}} to be arrested than the strange {{sweeping}} loop formed by the junction of the Alps and Apennines, and enclosing the great basin of Lombardy. This return of the mountain chain upon itself causes a vast difference in the character of the distribution of its débris on its opposite sides. The rock fragments and sediment which the torrents on the north side of the Alps bear into the plains are distributed over a vast extent of country, and, though here and there lodged in beds of enormous thickness, soon permit the firm substrata to appear from underneath them; but all the torrents which descend from the southern side of the High Alps, and from the northern slope of the Apennines, meet <b>concentrically</b> in the recess or mountain bay which the two ridges enclose; every fragment which thunder breaks out of their battlements, and every grain of dust which the summer rain washes from their pastures, is at last laid at rest in the blue sweep of the Lombardic plain; and that plain must have risen within its rocky barriers as a cup fills with wine, but for two contrary influences which continually depress, or disperse from its surface, the accumulation of the ruins of ages.|$|E
6000|$|I had {{no desire}} to {{continue}} in this depression, as I should in going north, for I should find nothing but lakes, marshes and ferneries, infested with the same primitive and monstrous forms of life. So I continued my course eastward and soon had the satisfaction to find myself meeting the sluggish current of such streams as I encountered in my way. By vigorous use of the new double-distance telepode, which enables the wearer to step eighty surindas instead of forty, as with the instrument in popular use, I was soon again at a considerable elevation above the sea-level and nearly 200 prastams from [...] "Pike's Peak." [...] A little farther along the water courses began to flow to the eastward. The flora and fauna had again altered in character, and now began to grow sparse; the soil was thin and arid, and in a week I found myself in a region absolutely destitute of organic life and without a vestige of soil. All was barren rock. The surface for hundreds of prastams, as I continued my advance, was nearly level, with a slight dip to the eastward. The rock was singularly striated, the scratches arranged <b>concentrically</b> and in helicoidal curves. This circumstance puzzled me and I resolved to take some more instrumental observations, bitterly regretting my improvidence in not availing myself of the Ahkoond's permission to bring with me such apparatus and assistants as would have given me knowledge vastly more copious and accurate than I could acquire with my simple pocket appliances.|$|E
60|$|The {{prevailing}} rock is a purplish or greenish, porphyritic claystone conglomerate. The embedded fragments vary in {{size from}} mere particles to blocks as much as six or eight inches (rarely more) in diameter; in many places, where the fragments were minute, the signs of aqueous deposition were unequivocally distinct; where they were large, such evidence could rarely be detected. The basis is generally porphyritic with perfect crystals of feldspar, and resembles that of a true injected claystone porphyry: often, however, it has a mechanical or sedimentary aspect, and sometimes (as at Jajuel) is jaspery. The included fragments are either angular, or partially or quite rounded (Some of the rounded fragments in the porphyritic conglomerate near the Baths of Cauquenes, were marked with radii and concentric zones of different shades of colour: any one {{who did not know}} that pebbles, for instance flint pebbles from the chalk, are sometimes zoned <b>concentrically</b> with their worn and rounded surfaces, might have been led to infer, that these balls of porphyry were not true pebbles, but had originated in concretionary action.); in some parts the rounded, in others the angular fragments prevail, and usually both kinds are mixed together: hence the word BRECCIA ought strictly to be appended to the term PORPHYRITIC CONGLOMERATE. The fragments consist of many varieties of claystone porphyry, usually of nearly the same colour with the surrounding basis, namely, purplish-reddish, brownish, mottled or bright green; occasionally fragments of a laminated, pale-coloured, feldspathic rock, like altered clay-slate are included; as are sometimes grains of quartz, but only in one instance in Central Chile (namely, at the mines of Jajuel) a few pebbles of quartz. I nowhere observed mica in this formation, and rarely hornblende; where the latter mineral did occur, I was generally in doubt whether the mass really belonged to this formation, or was of intrusive origin. Calcareous spar occasionally occurs in small cavities; and nests and layers of epidote are common. In some few places in the finer-grained varieties (for instance, at Quillota), there were short, interrupted layers of earthy feldspar, which could be traced, exactly as at Port Desire, passing into large crystals of feldspar: I doubt, however, whether in this instance the layers had ever been separately deposited as tufaceous sediment.|$|E
60|$|Whether the agreeableness of {{symmetry}} {{be in any}} way referable to its {{expression of}} the Aristotelian [Greek: isotês], {{that is to say}} of abstract justice, I leave the reader to determine; I only assert respecting it, {{that it is necessary to}} the dignity of every form, and that by the removal of it we shall render the other elements of beauty comparatively ineffectual: though, on the other hand, it is to be observed that it is rather a mode of arrangement of qualities than a quality itself; and hence symmetry has little power over the mind, unless all the other constituents of beauty be found together with it. A form may be symmetrical and ugly, as many Elizabethan ornaments, and yet not so ugly as it had been if unsymmetrical, but bettered always by increasing degrees of symmetry; as in star figures, wherein there is a circular symmetry of many like members, whence their frequent use for the plan and ground of ornamental designs; so also it is observable that foliage in which the leaves are <b>concentrically</b> grouped, as in the chestnuts, and many shrubs--rhododendrons for instance--(whence the perfect beauty of the Alpine rose)--is far nobler in its effect than any other, so that the sweet chestnut of all trees most fondly and frequently occurs in the landscape of Tintoret and Titian, beside which all other landscape grandeur vanishes: and even in the meanest things the rule holds, as in the kaleidoscope, wherein agreeableness is given to forms altogether accidental merely by their repetition and reciprocal opposition; which orderly balance and arrangement are essential to the perfect operation of the more earnest and solemn qualities of the beautiful, as being heavenly in their nature, and contrary to the violence and disorganization of sin, so that the seeking of them and submission to them is always marked in minds that have been subjected to high moral discipline, constant in all the great religious painters, to the degree of being an offence and a scorn to men of less tuned and tranquil feeling. Equal ranks of saints are placed on each side of the picture, if there be a kneeling figure on one side, there is a corresponding one on the other, the attendant angels beneath and above are arranged in like order. The Raffaelle at Blenheim, the Madonna di St. Sisto, the St. Cicilia, and all the works of Perugino, Francia, and John Bellini present some such form, and the balance at least is preserved even in pictures of action necessitating variety of grouping, as always by Giotto; and by Ghirlandajo in the introduction of his chorus-like side figures, and by Tintoret most eminently in his noblest work, the Crucifixion, where not only the grouping but the arrangement of light is absolutely symmetrical. Where there is no symmetry, the effects of passion and violence are increased, and many very sublime pictures derive their sublimity from the want of it, but they lose proportionally in the diviner quality of beauty. In landscape the same sense of symmetry is preserved, as we shall presently see, even to artificialness, by the greatest men, and it is one of the principal sources of deficient feeling in the landscapes of the present day, that the symmetry of nature is sacrificed to irregular picturesqueness. Of this, however, hereafter.|$|E
