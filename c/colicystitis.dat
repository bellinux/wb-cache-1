On July 3 she visited our out-patient clinic. On urological testing her case was diagnozed as <b>colicystitis.</b> The case was alleviated by chemotherapy. The woman was admitted to the hospital for closer examination on July 18 because the same symptoms of the urinary bladder reappeared. As a result of tests, her case was diagnozed as vesical cadidiasis. By oral administration of myocostatin she was completely cured of this disease. b) Experiments: 1) F our Candida strains were isolated to make some cultures from the urine of the said case of vesical candidiasis, 2 from the vaginal serection and 1 from the sputum. These were classified and identified according to the method of Martin et al. All these were identified as Candida albicans. 2) The same t est as mentioned under (1) was used on 43 Candida strains which were isolated from the vaginal secretion of healthy woman, pregnant woman and other woman. These were classified into 3 C. albicans strains, 7 C. krusei strains, 26 C. guilliermondii strains and 7 unidentified strains. 3) Use was made of SchObl and Mizuno-Takada media as differential media, and the strains under (1) and the standerd strains supplied by Jyuntendo University were inoculated into these media for observation purposes. However, it was impossible to identify the former strains by the use media. 4) Candida was isolated t o make cultures from the urine and vaginal secretion 700 cases of urosis, and attempts were also undertaken determine whether these cases were treated with antibiotics. As a result {{it was found that the}} Candida-positive rate was high in those patents with a history of antibiotic treatment. 5) Using Akiba and Kitamura antigens, the Candida intracutaneous reaction test was perfomed on 177 subjects, who were made up of healthy persons, case of urosis and other cases. There were many positive reactors in a group of cases with a high detection rate of Candida. 6) The lethal test which was done on mice using the strains under (1) and the standard strains under (1) and the standard strains disclosed no difference according to the type of Candida. 7) When the dye absorptive capacity of the strains under (6) was examined by adding a 3000, 000 dilution of gentian and crystal violets, it was revealed that the dye absorptive capacity of C. albicans was greater than those of other Candida strains. 8) The heat resistance test of the same strains under (6) sho w ed that C. albicans and C. krusei were 1 or 2 degrees more heat-resistant than other Candida strains...|$|E
