50|$|The {{final report}} states the {{following}} reason of the accident:The aviation incident with An-12 aircraft registered RA-12957 occurred {{as a result}} of impact with ground caused by lost control over the aircraft due to the destruction of aileron <b>control</b> <b>wires</b> during an emergency approach for landing because of smoke in the cabin.... Aileron <b>control</b> <b>wires</b> were destroyed most probably due to significant heating of nearby steel wires and subsequent breaking under operating load.The heating may have been caused by in-flight fire of nearby power lines, which is evidence by smoke in the cabin, unexpected triggering of multiple warnings, equipment failures and failure of two engines.|$|R

50|$|Occasionally, {{the owner}} of a new house under {{construction}} may choose to pre-install vacuum tubing and <b>control</b> <b>wiring</b> in the walls, but to defer purchase of the central unit, hose, and tools to reduce cash flow requirements. Installing tubing and wiring for a central vacuum in new construction is definitely much easier if done before the drywall and other wall finishes. The short-term cost savings of deferring full system completion should be weighed against the great convenience of having a functional vacuum system, especially during the commissioning and move-in period, which generate more than the usual amount of debris to be cleaned up.|$|E

The signal wire selectively {{has at least}} two different voltage states, ranging from a 0 state to a 1 state, wherein there is an asymmetry {{with respect to the}} direction of current flow from the signal wire through one junction compared to another junction such that current flowing through one junction into (out of) the signal wire can open (close) while current flowing through the other junction out of (into) the signal wire can close (open) the switch, and wherein there is a voltage threshold for switching between an open switch and a closed switch. Further, methods are provided for latching logic values onto nanowiresin a logic array, for inverting a logic value, and for restoring a voltage value of a signal in a nano-scale wire.

50|$|Great {{attention}} {{was paid to}} producing an aerodynamically clean design: the tailskid was arranged so that its bungee cord springing was inside the fuselage, the wheels had disks covering the spokes to reduce drag, and the wing-warping <b>control</b> <b>wires</b> were carried inside the inverted-v cabane struts.|$|R
50|$|Jupiter {{test flights}} officially {{commenced}} with {{the launch of}} AM-1A (ABMA Missile 1A) on 1 March 1957 from LC-5. This missile was equipped with the lower-thrust interim engine. The vehicle performed well until past 50 seconds into launch when control started to fail, leading to breakup at T+73 seconds. It was deduced that turbopump exhaust was sucked up by the partial vacuum in the area behind the missile and began to burn in the tail section. The heat burned though the <b>control</b> <b>wiring,</b> so extra insulation was added there on future flights. An identical AM-1B was quickly readied and launched on 26 April. AM-1B broke apart at T+93 seconds from propellant slosh, leading to the addition of baffles to the fuel tanks.|$|E
50|$|The pod {{itself is}} 17 ft long, and weighs 1850 lb. and {{is carried on}} the {{starboard}} side of the tunnel between the engine nacelles. The F-14A and F-14B Tomcats had to be specially modified to carry the TARPS pod which involved routing of <b>control</b> <b>wiring</b> from the rear cockpit and environmental control system (ECS) connections to the pod. Standard allowance was at least three TARPS aircraft per designated squadron (only one per airwing). All F-14Ds were modified to be TARPS capable, which allowed greater flexibility in scheduling aircraft and conducting maintenance. A control panel is fitted to the rear cockpit and the RIO has total control over pod operation except for a pilot controlled button that can activate cameras as selected by the RIO (but seldom used).|$|E
5000|$|The PC {{explosion}} in the late 1980s and early 1990s signalled {{the end of the}} road for proprietary DNC terminals. With some exceptions, CNC manufacturers began migrating to PC-based controls running DOS, Windows or OS/2 which could be linked in to existing networks using standard protocols. Customers began migrating away from expensive minicomputer and workstation based CAD/CAM toward more cost-effective PC-based solutions. Users began to demand more from their DNC systems than secure upload/download and editing. PC-based systems which could accomplish these tasks based on standard networks began to be available at minimal or no cost. In some cases, users no longer needed a DNC [...] "expert" [...] to implement shop floor networking, and could do it themselves. However, the task can still be a challenge based on the CNC <b>Control</b> <b>wiring</b> requirements, parameters and NC program format.|$|E

500|$|Due {{to their}} low weight {{and the fact}} that they had only one <b>control</b> <b>wire</b> per leg, the puppets were unable to walk convincingly. Therefore, scenes {{involving}} movement were filmed from the waist up, with a puppeteer holding the legs below the level of the camera and using a [...] "bobbing" [...] action to simulate motion. Alternatively, dynamic shots were eliminated altogether: in an interview with New Scientist, director of photography John Read spoke of the advantages of circumventing the lack of agility so that the puppets [...] "appear, for example, to walk through doors (although the <b>control</b> <b>wires</b> make this impossible) or pick up a coffee cup (although their fingers are not in fact jointed)." [...] Live-action shots of human hands were inserted whenever scripts called for more dexterous actions to be performed.|$|R

5000|$|New-bought wood cars {{numbered}} 10-209 and 309-310, equipped at Wheaton Shops, had GE C6 controllers. Cars 300-308 and 311-321 {{were built}} new with C21 controllers but several were switched to C6 {{control in the}} 1950s. Initially all wood motor cars ordered by the railroad were fitted with two complete sets of electro-magnetic contactors, resistors, and reversers, as the most modern contactors available in 1902 had been designed for Manhattan Elevated cars fitted with two GE 66 motors and were incapable of handling current for four motors. Later cars used more modern contactors but retained the dual sets of equipment, but [...] "half motors" [...] only kept one set of control equipment per car. The all-steel cars from Pullman and Cincinnati had GE C165 controllers. The final St. Louis cars had GE 739 motors and GE M-17KC2-19 control. All wood passenger cars could train {{with each other and}} all steel passenger cars could train with each other but the two fleets could not be intermixed. Besides differences in <b>control</b> <b>wiring,</b> the wood cars had Van Dorn couplers while the steel cars had incompatible Tomlinson couplers.|$|E
50|$|On September 24, the Atlas was {{prepared}} for a planned 12-minute PFRT (Pre-Flight Readiness Test). The satellite {{was not on the}} launch vehicle, the third stage was a dummy, and the second stage was unfueled. After 2.5 seconds of engine operation, a fire erupted in the Atlas's thrust section. Fed by leaking liquid oxygen, it proved impossible to put out with pad extinguishers and soon a huge inferno was raging on LC-12. Thirty-seven seconds after the fire began, the Atlas toppled over in a massive fireball, the biggest explosion seen at Cape Canaveral up to that point. The pad was severely damaged, with both umbilical towers totally destroyed, the concrete launch stand caved in, and the service tower knocked over. It would take months of repairs to get it back online. The final explosion was believed {{to be the result of}} loss of tank pressure. Engine shutdown caused the propellant valves to snap shut, causing overpressurization of the propellant tanks. Ground operators in the blockhouse flipped manual override switches to lower RP-1 pressure and increase LOX pressure, but the missile did not respond, possibly due to fire-induced damage to the <b>control</b> <b>wiring</b> on the pad. The pneumatic control system automatically threw open the LOX boil-off valve to vent tank pressure, which apparently continued until the tanks lost support pressure to the point where their structural integrity failed. At around 35 seconds, the intermediate bulkhead collapsed, causing the LOX to fall into the RP-1 tank and mix. The propellants turned into a gel that detonated with the force of 20,000 pounds (9070 kg) of TNT and resulted in an extremely powerful explosion that caused extensive pad damage.|$|E
5000|$|Electricians were {{originally}} people who demonstrated or studied {{the principles of}} electricity, often electrostatic generators of one form or another. In the United States, electricians are divided into two primary categories: linemen, who work on electric utility company distribution systems at higher voltages, and wiremen, who work with the lower voltages utilized inside buildings. Wiremen are generally trained in one of five primary specialties: commercial, residential, light industrial, industrial, and low-voltage wiring, more commonly known as Voice-Data-Video, or VDV. Other sub-specialties such as <b>control</b> <b>wiring</b> and fire-alarm may be performed by specialists trained in the devices being installed, or by inside wiremen. Electricians are trained {{to one of three}} levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master Electrician. In the US and Canada, apprentices work and receive a reduced compensation while learning their trade. They generally take several hundred hours of classroom instruction and are contracted to follow apprenticeship standards for a period of between three and six years, during which time they are paid {{as a percentage of the}} Journeyman's pay. Journeymen are electricians who have completed their Apprenticeship and who have been found by the local, State, or National licensing body to be competent in the electrical trade. Master Electricians have performed well in the trade for a period of time, often seven to ten years, and have passed an exam to demonstrate superior knowledge of the National Electrical Code, or NEC. Service electricians are tasked to respond to requests for isolated repairs and upgrades. They have skills troubleshooting wiring problems, installing wiring in existing buildings, and making repairs. Construction electricians primarily focus on larger projects, such as installing all new electrical system for an entire building, or upgrading an entire floor of an office building as part of a remodeling process. Other specialty areas are marine electricians, research electricians and hospital electricians. [...] "Electrician" [...] is also used as the name of a role in stagecraft, where electricians are tasked primarily with hanging, focusing, and operating stage lighting. In this context, the Master Electrician is the show's chief electrician. Although theater electricians routinely perform electrical work on stage lighting instruments and equipment, they are not part of the electrical trade and have a different set of skills and qualifications from the electricians that work on building wiring. In the film industry and on a television crew the head electrician is referred to as a Gaffer. Electrical contractors are businesses that employ electricians to design, install, and maintain electrical systems. Contractors are responsible for generating bids for new jobs, hiring tradespeople for the job, providing material to electricians in a timely manner, and communicating with architects, electrical and building engineers, and the customer to plan and complete the finished product.|$|E
50|$|Some early {{microprocessors}} (e.g. the Zilog Z80) provided special internal registers {{that could}} provide the Row-Address Strobe (RAS) to refresh dynamic memory cells, the register being incremented on each refresh cycle. This could also be accomplished by other integrated circuits already {{being used in the}} system, if these already generated cycling accesses across RAM (e.g. the Motorola 6845). In CPUs such as the Z80, the availability of a RAS refresh was a big selling-point due to its simplifying hardware design. Here, RAS refresh is signalled by a unique combination of address and <b>control</b> <b>wires</b> during operationally redundant clock cycles (T-States), i.e. during instruction decode/execution when the buses may not be required. Instead of the bus being inactive during such T-states, the refresh register would be presented on the address bus along with a combination of <b>control</b> <b>wires</b> to indicate to the refresh circuitry.|$|R
