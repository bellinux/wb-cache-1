50|$|Ortho Pharmaceutical was {{initially}} {{formed in the}} United States in 1931 as a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson to market the first prescription spermicidal <b>contraceptive</b> <b>jelly,</b> Ortho-Gynol.|$|E
50|$|In Logan County, West Virginia, Clarence {{conducted}} the most thorough field {{trial of a}} chemical contraceptive that had ever been undertaken in the United States. The trial involved 1,345 women who used <b>contraceptive</b> <b>jelly</b> over a three-year period, from June 1936 to August 1939, and decreased their birth rate by 41 percent.|$|E
50|$|In 1938, {{satisfied}} {{with the results of}} his study, Gamble began to withdraw his funding. Final results of his tests showed the <b>contraceptive</b> <b>jelly</b> method to be 85% effective. Also in 1938, Lena Gilliam married and left her work with the league. These events would lead to changes within the league which had changed its name to the Mountain Maternal Health League in 1937.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} decades of the twentieth century, the only {{acceptable}} contraceptive was the diaphragm. The diaphragm was used with spermicidal jelly, and the League needed to determine which <b>contraceptive</b> <b>jellies,</b> among the many advertised, were effective. Clarence, ready at hand with a lab at the University of Pennsylvania, did some very practical research, and soon he and Sarah were actively supporting the League and the clinic with both his research and funding.By 1930, Clarence was chairman of the board of the Philadelphia Maternal Health Centers. In this new capacity, Clarence learned of the innumerable families in Philadelphia whose children were neither planned nor wanted. He was soon convinced that there must be a simple method of contraception, one that did not require a costly doctorâ€™s visit as did fitting of the diaphragm, and that was inexpensive and immediately available.|$|R
5000|$|Riddlesbarger is {{believed}} to have been an Army Air Corps pilot during World War I. He later worked for the U.S. Post Office, flying air mail starting in 1920, but was grounded in 1921 for failing to promptly report a forced landing, resulting in delay to the mail. Riddlesbarger invented a diaphragm that was successfully marketed through his firm, Lanteen Laboratories, using storefront clinics called [...] "Medical Bureaus of Birth Control Information" [...] and a variety of media, including radio, direct mailings to doctors, and in packages of sanitary napkins. One of Riddlesbarger's clinic operators, Adele Gordon, was, with her husband John, unsuccessfully prosecuted in 1935 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin for selling birth control devices. Lanteen Laboratories had been organized in 1928, with 90% of its stock owned by Riddlesbarger. Lanteen sold a comprehensive line of products, including <b>contraceptive</b> <b>jellies,</b> douches, tampons and suppositories.|$|R
5000|$|Birth {{control and}} {{abortion}} are well documented in Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. (See History of abortion.) The Ebers Papyrus from 1550 BCE and the Kahun Papyrus from 1850 BCE have within them {{some of the}} earliest documented descriptions of birth control, the use of honey, acacia leaves and lint to be placed in the vagina to block sperm. Another early document explicitly referring to birth control methods is the Kahun Gynecological Papyrus from about 1850 BCE. It describes various contraceptive pessaries, including acacia gum, which recent research has confirmed to have spermatocidal qualities and is still used in <b>contraceptive</b> <b>jellies.</b> Other birth control methods mentioned in the papyrus include the application of gummy substances to cover the [...] "mouth of the womb" [...] (i.e. the cervix), a mixture of honey and sodium carbonate applied {{to the inside of the}} vagina, and a pessary made from crocodile dung. Lactation (breast-feeding) of up to three years was also used for birth control purposes in ancient Egypt.|$|R
50|$|Gilliam {{would visit}} {{the homes and}} conduct {{interviews}} and evaluations with potential clients. If {{they were interested in}} contraceptives, Gilliam would answer questions regarding the <b>contraceptive</b> <b>jelly</b> and nozzles she would distribute. Because Gamble wanted to test low-cost contraceptives and their effectiveness in rural populations, the diaphragm was deemed too expensive to distribute. In addition, diaphragms had to be fitted and required frequent follow up visits - a difficult task for rural women due to transportation difficulties. Kentucky Maternal Health clients paid for the supplies if able and additional supplies were sent to a central location where they could pick them up. During this time, the league distributed contraceptive supplies to Appalachian doctors for distribution among their patients and they began coordinating clinic locations in Harlan, KY and Sevierville, TN.|$|E
