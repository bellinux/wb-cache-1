500|$|The first floor, partly {{covered by}} a paved plaza above, housed the reactor, laboratory, crystal spectrometer, a <b>counting</b> <b>room</b> with a nuclear densometer, classrooms, restrooms and offices. The second floor {{contained}} the control room and an observatory and lecture room overlooking the reactor, and was open to the outside plaza on three sides. The reactor {{was placed on the}} lower side of the building, downhill of the plaza, to allow the ground to absorb accidental radiation leaks. The roof rested on a series of perpendicular beams that also supported the weight of a 3-ton ( [...] kg) crane used to lift the reactor shield.|$|E
60|$|Along {{one side}} of the <b>counting</b> <b>room</b> was a row of small windows, each labeled with its {{department}} name.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>count</b> <b>rooms</b> are {{equipped}} with closed-circuit television cameras and sometimes sound recording equipment to assist in detecting theft, fraud, or collusion among the <b>count</b> <b>room</b> personnel.|$|R
5000|$|Typically, a soft <b>count</b> <b>room</b> {{contains}} a large table {{upon which the}} currency to be counted is placed, known as the [...] "count table". <b>Count</b> <b>room</b> personnel manually organize the currency {{so that it can}} be easily counted by hand or by a counting machine.|$|R

60|$|It {{was four}} {{o'clock in the}} {{afternoon}} of a dull winter day that Mr. H. sat in his <b>counting</b> <b>room.</b> The sun had nearly gone down, and, in fact, it was already twilight beneath the shadows of the tall, dusky stores, and the close, crooked streets of that quarter of Boston. Hardly light enough struggled through the dusky panes of the counting house for him to read the entries in a much-thumbed memorandum book, which he held in his hand.|$|E
60|$|And {{this reminds}} me how often I used to pass by the places on deck, where I remembered Mr. Jones had stood when we first visited the ship lying at the wharf; and how I tried to {{convince}} myself that it was indeed true, that he had stood there, though now the ship was so far away on the wide Atlantic Ocean, and he perhaps was walking down Wall-street, or sitting reading the newspaper in his <b>counting</b> <b>room,</b> while poor I was so differently employed.|$|E
60|$|The Syndic led {{him from}} the chamber {{in which he had}} slept to his own <b>counting</b> <b>room,</b> in which he transacted his affairs of business, and after bolting the door, and casting a {{piercing}} and careful eye around him, he opened a concealed and vaulted closet behind the tapestry, in which stood more than one iron chest. He proceeded to open one which was full of guilders, and placed it at Quentin's discretion to take whatever sum he might think necessary for his companion's expenses and his own.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, a <b>count</b> <b>room</b> {{would be}} {{operated}} {{by at least}} three people. The first two people independently counted stacks of currency and recorded the results on a count card. The third person examined the two count cards {{to ensure that the}} first two people recorded the same amount. If there was a difference between the amounts recorded on the two count cards, the currency would be recounted. Some smaller volume cash businesses still operate a <b>count</b> <b>room</b> in this fashion.|$|R

6000|$|When the Rovers {{had first}} opened up in Wall Street, {{they had taken}} {{possession}} {{of a set of}} rather shabby offices formerly occupied by another firm with which they had had various difficulties, the particulars of which were related in [...] "The Rover Boys in New York" [...] and [...] "The Rover Boys in Business." [...] Now, however, they occupied the entire fourth floor of another building in a much better location. There was a large general office and a <b>counting</b> <b>room,</b> and a private office {{for each of the three}} brothers. Their office help numbered about twenty; and when business was brisk, the place consequently was a decidedly busy one.|$|E
60|$|Some of the Quakers {{carry the}} {{principle}} {{so far as}} to refuse money in a business transaction which they have reason to believe has been gained by the unpaid toil of the slave. A Friend in Edinburgh told me of a brother of his in the city of Carlisle, who kept a celebrated biscuit bakery, who received an order from New Orleans for a thousand dollars worth of biscuit. Before closing the bargain he took the buyer into his <b>counting</b> <b>room,</b> and told him that he had conscientious objections about receiving money from slaveholders, and that in case he were one he should prefer not to trade with him. Fortunately, in this case, consistency and interest were both on one side.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a very}} {{pleasant}} little room on the lower floor, {{on one side of}} the archway which formed the entrance into the court of the hotel from the street, that served the purpose of parlor, sitting room, <b>counting</b> <b>room,</b> and office. Thus it was used both by the master of the hotel himself and by his family. There was a desk at one side, where the master usually sat, with his books and papers before him. At the other side, near a window, his wife was often seated at her sewing; and there were frequently two or three little children playing about the floor with little wagons, or tops, or other toys. Rollo went to this room, occupying himself as he descended the stairs in trying to make up a French sentence that would ask his question in the shortest and simplest manner.|$|E
50|$|A soft {{count is}} one process for {{counting}} banknotes in a casino or bank. The soft <b>count</b> <b>rooms</b> are usually {{among the most}} secure places due to the large amounts of cash that can be on hand at any one time.|$|R
60|$|Then a wild desire took me {{to obtain}} the key at any risk, and I {{determined}} then and there to scale the wall again, and gain the <b>Count's</b> <b>room.</b> He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of evils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled down the wall, as before, into the <b>Count's</b> <b>room.</b> It was empty, but that was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold remained. I went through {{the door in the}} corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well enough where to find the monster I sought.|$|R
50|$|A <b>count</b> <b>room</b> may {{be divided}} into two {{separate}} areas, one for counting banknotes (sometimes referred to as soft count) and one for counting coins (sometimes referred to as hard count). Some high-volume cash businesses, especially casinos, will operate two distinct rooms.|$|R
6000|$|He {{watched and}} waited for three months, {{so that he might}} not be accused of precipitation, though it did not take him one to decide that this was the woman to make him happy. Her steadfast nature, quiet, busy ways, and the {{reserved}} power and passion betrayed sometimes by a flash of the black eyes, a quiver of the firm lips, suited Archie, who possessed many of the same attributes himself. The obscurity of her birth and isolation of her lot, which would have deterred some lovers, not only appealed to his kindly heart, but touched the hidden romance which ran like a vein of gold through his strong common sense and made practical, steady-going Archie a poet when he fell in love. If Uncle Mac had guessed what dreams and fancies went on in the head bent over his ledgers, and what emotions were fermenting in the bosom of his staid [...] "right-hand man," [...] he would have tapped his forehead and suggested a lunatic asylum. The boys thought Archie had sobered down too soon. His mother began to fear that the air of the <b>counting</b> <b>room</b> did not suit him, and Dr. Alec was deluded into the belief that the fellow really began to [...] "think of Rose," [...] he came so often in the evening, seeming quite content to sit beside her worktable and snip tape or draw patterns while they chatted.|$|E

60|$|When {{a couple}} of hours had passed I heard {{something}} stirring in the <b>Count's</b> <b>room,</b> something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed. And then there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a beating heart, I tried the door, but I was locked in my prison, and could do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.|$|R

50|$|A count room or <b>counting</b> <b>room</b> is a {{room that}} is {{designed}} and equipped {{for the purpose of}} counting large volumes of currency. Count rooms are operated by central banks and casinos, as well as some large banks and armored car companies that transport currency.|$|E
50|$|Most modern <b>count</b> <b>rooms</b> are {{equipped}} with high-speed computerized machines that perform the counting process. Typically, these machines are capable of counting between ten and twenty banknotes per second. After currency is prepared on the count table, it is transferred to the machine's operator, who inserts the prepared stacks into the machine. The machine authenticates each banknote, separates the counted banknotes according to denomination, and provides a printed or electronic report of the results.|$|R
