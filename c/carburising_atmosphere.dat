40|$|The {{present study}} {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} degradation of cast elements carrying charge in carburising furnaces. The wear and tear of castings, which finally results in decohesion of walls, is due to an effect of the <b>carburising</b> <b>atmosphere</b> and thermal fatigue.

40|$|A {{number of}} valves {{were found to have}} {{fractured}} in the stem portion during the straightening process after welding and tempering operations. The broken valves along with a few unbroken valves from the same lot of manufacturing were sent to the laboratory for analysis. Examination revealed that the stem of the valves got surface hardened to as high as 530 HV. Due to this high surface hardness, the stem portion of the valves might have fractured during the straightening process. It appears most probable that during heat treatment, the furnace had <b>carburising</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> which resulted in surface hardening of the stems...|$|E
40|$|The study {{presents}} the results of own investigations and of the investigations described in technical literature regarding various methods of improving the resistance to carburising of the creep-resistant structural parts of carburising furnaces. Most of the studies referred to were carried out in a Foundry of the Szczecin University of Technology. The results of the investigations on the effect of chemical composition of austenitic cast steel on its resistance to the carburising effect controlled through application of the anti-carburising coatings based on aluminium and constituted on high-alloy steel substrate were summarised. The possibility to use machining of castings as a means to raise their performance life in <b>carburising</b> <b>atmosphere</b> was also mentioned...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Purpose {{consideration}} of role of phosphorus in iron alloys surface engineering and {{relations of the}} iron phosphides layers growth parameters in processes of phosphorising, phosphorcarburising, and phosphonitriding with their structure and properties. Design/methodology/approach: The layers were generated on a base of Armco iron and 0. 4 %C, 1. 1 %Cr steel {{as a result of}} annealing in a mixture of argon or <b>carburising,</b> nitriding <b>atmosphere</b> and phosphorus vapours in: temperature T = 700 - 1170 K, phosphorus partial pressure p = 0. 1 - 20 kPa, process duration t = 3. 6 - 21. 6 ks. The diffusion layers were investigated by means of the methods: metallographic, X - ray structural analysis, microanalysis, Vickers and wear dry friction resistance tests. Findings: Formation of compact layer of phosphides with the adjustable relation of Fe 3 P to Fe 2 P was described; means of growth and kinetics of iron phosphides layers and phosphocarburised and phosphonitrided were explained, it was found that iron phosphides presence in steel surface increases its hardness and resistance to wear. Research limitations/implications: Research implications it was found that nucleation Fe 3 P crystals starts in areas of surface being found in a certain distance from iron grains boundaries and the growth process of iron phosphide continuous layers is an effect of iron diffusion through phosphide layer from the core towards the surface. In advanced phases of the of iron phosphide layer growth, a gap between the layer and the base is created as a process of degradation of the base layer interface. Practical implications: Practical implications: it has found that the obtained layers are new kind of composites diffusive layers with iron phosphide particles generated as a result of phosphorising, phosphorcarburising or phosphonitriding with very promising tribobiological propertiesOriginality/value: An original value of the paper is description of the formation elementary processes, structure and properties of the layers...|$|R
40|$|Metal dusting {{is a type}} of high {{temperature}} corrosion in which Fe-, Ni- or Co-base alloys are disintegrated from bulk materials into metal or carbide particles in a coke deposit formed in strongly <b>carburising</b> gas <b>atmospheres</b> (carbon activity ac > 1) at elevated temperatures (400 - 800 °C). Mechanism study reveals that dusting occurs only when graphite grows into the metal or carbide interior, disrupting its structure and converting it to the dust. Therefore, prevention of dusting requires a surface barrier to carbon entry. The aim of this project is to investigate the effect of nano-crystalline structure on carburization and metal dusting of nickel-chromium alloys. Nano-crystalline Ni-Cr structure was prepared by either sputtering coating or electro-plating, which was then reacted in 47 %CO- 47 %H 2 - 6 %H 2 O gas for 50 h or pre-oxidised first in 47 %Ar- 47 %H 2 - 6 %H 2 O gas for 24 h and then in carburizing gas for 50 h at 650 °C. The coarse grained Ni-Cr alloys were also reacted in the same reaction conditions for the comparison. In general, increasing Cr content reduced weight gain kinetics. For sputtering coated Ni-Cr alloys, without pre-oxidation, Ni- 5 Cr experienced a significant metal dusting. Higher Cr content, Ni- 10 Cr and 20 Cr alloys, however, appeared little attack due to the formation of chromia scales on the surface and along the interfaces among the columns. Both alloys formed other reaction products inside of columnar coating scales, with fine graphite deposits for Ni- 10 Cr and relatively large Cr 7 C 3 precipitates for Ni- 20 Cr. For electroplated samples, the rates of weight gain performed a slow increase first, followed by an accelerated increase. Pre-oxidation before dusting significantly improved the resistance of alloy against carburization and metal dusting for all cases. This effect is especially significant for low Cr content Ni- 5 Cr and for nano-coated alloys as fine grain size accelerates chromium diffusion and therefore the protective oxide scale formation. The effect of chromium content on protective chromia scale formation and chromium carbide formation is analysed using Wagner’s analysis and product solubility calculation. The prediction is basically in agreement with the experimental observation...|$|R
40|$|The {{decomposition}} of cementite formed from hematite and pre-oxidised titanomagnetite {{was investigated in}} the temperature range from 500 °C to 925 °C for hematite, and from 300 °C to 1100 °C for titanomagnetite under a <b>carburising</b> <b>atmosphere</b> in a fixed bed reactor. For hematite, cementite was most stable at temperatures 7 S 0 - 770 °C. The decomposition rate increased with decreasing temperature between 7 S 0 °C and 600 °C and with increasing temperature above 770 °C. For ironsand, cementite was most stable in the temperature range 700 - 900 °C.

40|$|The mass {{transfer}} during carburising in a fluidised bed {{and in a}} steel workpiece has been studied experimentally in this work. This involved carburising experiment in an electrically heated fluidised bed at 900 – 970 °C with natural gas and air as the atmosphere. A steel workpiece was {{designed to provide a}} range of carbon transfer surfaces of different geometries in the fluidised bed, and the carbon transfer coefficient was measured at these surfaces. The carbon transfer coefficient was determined from the carbon distribution within the diffusion layer of the sample. An empirical relationship of the carbon potential as a function of <b>carburising</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> bed temperature and fluidising velocity was determined, based on the understanding of the {{mass transfer}} mechanism and analysis of the experimental results. <br /...|$|E
