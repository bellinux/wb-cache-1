In this study, the yeast extract elicitation on vinblastine and vincristine was studied in various protoplast derived tissues and plantlets. Four different yeast extract treatments (T 1 = 0. 5 g/l, T 2 = 1. 0 g/l, T 3 = 1. 5 g/l and T 4 = 2. 0 g/l) were prepared and used.

Susceptibility testing was determined using a tablet diffusion method. 		Results. The number of clinical Candida isolates (one from each patient) was 57 (20. 6 %).

40|$|For {{the last}} century, the {{availability}} of pure <b>culture</b> <b>yeast</b> has improved reproducibility in wine fermentations and product quality. However, {{there is not a}} single wine yeast strain that possesses an ideal combination of oenological characteristics that are optimised for the task set by today´s leading winemakers. With new developments in modern winemaking there has arisen an urgent need to modify wine yeast strains in order to take full advantage of technology and to satisfy the demands of the sophisticated wine consumers. The combined use of mutagenesis, hybridisation and recombinant DNA methods have significantly increased the genetic diversity that can be introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. The overall aim of the strain development programmes extends far beyond the primary role of wine yeast to catalyse the rapid and complete conversion of grape sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide without distorting the flavour of the final product. Starter cultures of S. cerevisiae must now possess a range of other properties that differ with the type and style of wine to be made and the technical requirements of the winery. Our strain development programme focuses on a number of targets that are amenable to a genetic approach, including strain security and quality control, the increase of fermentation and processing efficiencies, and the enhancement of the sensorial quality and health properties of wine and other grape-based beverages. However, successful commercialisation of transgenic wine yeasts will depend on a multitude of scientific, technical, economic, marketing, safety, regulatory, legal and ethical issues. Therefore, it would be foolish to entertain unrealistic expectations over rapid commercialisation and short-term benefits. However, it will be equally unwise to deny the potential advantages of genetically improved wine yeasts to both the winemaker and consumer in the third millennium...|$|E
40|$|Definitions {{of death}} are mostly negative. We call an {{organism}} dead when it shows no more the symptoms which we consider characteristic of life. Staining with certain dyes, which is frequently {{used as a}} distinction between living and dead cells, is also a negative critenon, being caused {{by the loss of}} selective permeability of the plasma membrane. The standard definition of bacteriologists considers a bacterium dead if it does not produce colonies on agar; the criterion is loss of reproductive power. To establish a basis for comparison, the authors compared the death rates of a pure <b>culture</b> <b>yeast</b> as measured by various criteria. The yeast was a bottom-fermenting beer yeast, grown on raisin extract + 0. 5 per cent yeast extract + 0. 5 per cent KH 2 PO 4. After 2 days' growth at 30 °, the yeast was centrifuged from its medium and kept near 0 ° in a buffer solution of pH 4. 6. The criteria observed were: (1) loss of reproduction, measured by the plate count on raisin agar; (2) loss of fermentation, measured by the COs pressure from 3 cc. of yeast suspension in glucose, by means of a fermentometer (Rahn, 1929); (3) change of staining reaction, measured by mixing equal amounts of yeast suspension and 0. 01 per cent methylene blue solution; (4) loss of selective permeability, measured by mixing equal parts of yeast suspension and 0. 2 per cent Congo red solution. Cells which are stained by the last two methods are considered to be dead. In addition to this, the coagulation of the protoplasm was observed occasionally, in the dark-field (Bancroft and Richter, 1931) {{as well as in the}} light-field. * This investigation has been made possible through a grant by the Hecksche...|$|E
40|$|In the Czech Republic <b>yeast</b> <b>cultures</b> have re-cently {{become an}} {{occasional}} component of feed-ing rations for cattle. Some papers informed about significant effects of <b>yeast</b> <b>cultures</b> on fermentation under specific anaerobic conditions existing in ru-men. Numerous studies (Sune et al., 1998; Alshaikh et al., 2002; Lila et al., 2004 and others) documented {{positive effects of}} <b>yeast</b> <b>cultures</b> {{not only on the}} rumen environment of dairy cows but also on the improvement of microbial activities. According to Blake (1993), <b>yeast</b> <b>cultures</b> obviously improve the cellulolytic activities of rumen microorgan-isms {{in such a way that}} they increase their total numbers, improve fibre digestion, reduce lactate accumulation, reduce the concentration of oxygen in rumen fluid and improve utilisation of starch supplied in the feeding ration. In this way they in-fluence (inhibit) the rate of VFA production and, thus, increase the stability of rumen environment and improve the intensity of digestion. Sullivan and Martin (1999) also reported that the supple-ment of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>yeast</b> <b>culture</b> into the diet of dairy cows improved the utilisation of lactate and digestion of cellulose. Lyons (1993) and Strohlein (2003) stated that some yeast strains showed a better capability to use lactate because they stimulated its utilization by propionic acid bacteria.

2500|$|Pure <b>culture</b> <b>yeasts</b> {{that are}} grown {{in a lab}} are often freeze dried and {{packaged}} for commercial use. Prior to their addition into must, these yeasts need to be re-hydrated in [...] "starter cultures" [...] that must be carefully monitored (particularly in regards to temperature) {{to insure that the}} yeast cells are not killed off by cold shock. Ideally winemakers want to add enough inoculum to have a viable cell population density of 5 million cells per milliliter. The exact amount of freeze-dried culture varies by manufacturer and strain of yeast but it is often around 1gram per gallon (or 25grams per 100 liters). Wines that could have potentially problematic fermentation (such as high sugar level late harvest or botryized wines) may have more yeast added.|$|R
