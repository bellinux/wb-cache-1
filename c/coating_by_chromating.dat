Chromate and cis-platinum both complex proteins of similar molecular weight and isoelectric points, and these complexes can be disrupted by chelating agents and sulfhydryl reducing agents, suggesting that the metal itself is participating in binding rather than having a catalytic or indirect role (i. e., oxygen radicals). In contrast, formaldehyde complexed histones to the DNA, and these complexes were not disrupted by chelating or reducing agents. An antiserum raised to chromate-induced DNA-protein complexes reacted primarily with 97, 000 kDa protein that did not silver stain.

40|$|The {{potential}} role of {{iron and}} copper and the involvement of hydroxyl radicals in the DNA cleavage caused <b>by</b> <b>chromate</b> and glutathione (GSH) has been investigated. We have also studied the ability of chromate, on reaction with ascorbate {{as well as in}} mixed solutions of ascorbate and GSH, to cause DNA strand breaks. In both fully demetalated and conventional (i. e., metal contaminated) systems, chromate and GSH induced similar numbers of DNA strand breaks. This observation suggests that traces of iron or copper contaminating the reaction mixtures do not {{play a major role in}} the DNA cleavage caused <b>by</b> <b>chromate</b> and GSH. A series of hydroxyl radical scavengers exhibited a protective influence on the induction of DNA strand breaks. However, glucose and sucrose, both strong hydroxyl radical scavengers, showed no concentration-dependent inhibition of DNA cleavage. Competition kinetics studies yielded apparent rate constants that were not consistent with hydroxyl radicals being the species responsible for DNA strand breaks. Ascorbate in combination with chromate was also found to induce strand breaks in DNA; this damage could be attributed to reactive intermediates generated during the reduction. When mixed systems of ascorbate and GSH in the presence of chromate were investigated, there were clearly interactions between the two reductants. - Environ Health Perspect 1 02 (Suppl 3) : 237 - 241 (1994...|$|R
40|$|Using o-pthaldialdehyde (OPT) fluorescence, {{the amino}} acids {{associated}} with DNA were studied following exposure of intact Chinese hamster ovary cells to chromate. Rigorous extraction with EDTA, acid, or base {{was required to}} release the amino acids cross-linked to the DNA isolated from control or chromate-treated cells by standard procedures (i. e., proteinase K, phenol, etc.). Amino acids resisting extraction from DNA were not studied since analysis was limited to those that could be released by these procedures. There was a chromate dose-dependent increase in amino acids complexed with the DNA that could be released by EDTA, acid, and base, and these amino acids were separated by HPLC and identified. Substantial increases in cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, histidine, threonine, and tyrosine were found {{as a function of}} increasing concentrations of chromate. There was also a time-dependent increase in complexing of these amino acids to the DNA <b>by</b> <b>chromate.</b> The amino acids found complexed to DNA in intact cells <b>by</b> <b>chromate</b> were thought to originate from reactions of free amino acids or small peptides with the DNA rather than being proteolytic products derived from larger proteins that were cross-linked to the DNA.

No significant change was observed in Chlorophyll a content, while the levels of transpiration, stomatal conductance and net CO 2 assimilation were strongly reduced after plant exposure to chromate. In particular, in Cr-treated plants the decrease of stomatal conductance was ascribed to the alteration of leaf cell ultrastructure, and it was mainly responsible for the photosynthesis decline, which in turn was the cause of the reduction of fresh weight biomass...|$|R

The variables observed were physiological data (heart rate, respiration rate, and rectal temperature), blood profiles (erythrocyte, hemoglobin, packed cell volume (PCV), leucocytes) and body composition (water, protein and fat) measured using Urea Space technique. Results of the study showed that sheep fed with Ca-saponified lemuru oil <b>coated</b> <b>by</b> herbs was not significantly different on heart rate, respiration rate and rectal temperature among treatments.
