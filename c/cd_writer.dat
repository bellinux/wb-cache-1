After a metallic reflecting layer (usually aluminium, but sometimes gold or other metal) {{is applied to the}} clear blank substrate, the disc goes under a UV light for curing and it is ready to go to press. To prepare to press a CD, a glass master is made, using a high-powered laser on a device similar to a <b>CD</b> <b>writer.</b> The glass master is a positive image of the desired CD surface (with the desired microscopic pits and lands). After testing, it is used to make a die by pressing it against a metal disc.|$|E

50|$|During {{the times}} of <b>CD</b> <b>writer</b> drives, they are often marked with three {{different}} speed ratings. In these cases, the first speed is for write-once (R) operations, the second speed for re-write (RW) operations, and the last speed for read-only (ROM) operations. For example, a 40×/16×/48× <b>CD</b> <b>writer</b> drive is capable of writing to CD-R media at speed of 40× (6,000 KB/s), writing to CD-RW media at speed of 16× (2,400 KB/s), and reading from a CD-ROM media at speed of 48× (7,200 KB/s).|$|E

50|$|A {{virtual disk}} writer or virtual burner is a {{computer}} program that emulates an actual disc authoring device such as a <b>CD</b> <b>writer</b> or DVD writer. Instead of writing data to an actual disc, it creates a virtual disk image. A virtual burner, by definition, appears as a disc drive in the system with writing capabilities (as opposed to conventional disc authoring programs that can create virtual disk images), thus allowing software that can burn discs to create virtual discs.|$|E

[...] Retrospective reviews have also been favourable. Rating the album four and a half stars out of five, AllMusic's John Storm Roberts called Babeti Soukous a [...] "fine performance with touches probably never heard from Rochereau before," [...] and although finding the [...] "DJ and 'live recording' conceit" [...] to be [...] "silly," [...] he called the album [...] "excellent". In the 1992 book World Beat: A Listener's Guide to Contemporary World Music on <b>CD,</b> <b>writer</b> Peter Spencer described Babeti Soukous as a [...] "rewarding album."

50|$|In computing, {{an optical}} disc drive (ODD) is a disk drive that uses laser light or {{electromagnetic}} waves within {{or near the}} visible light spectrum {{as part of the}} process of reading or writing data to or from optical discs. Some drives can only read from certain discs, but recent drives can both read and record, also called burners or writers. Compact discs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs are common types of optical media which can be read and recorded by such drives. Optical disc drives that are no longer in production include CD-ROM drive, <b>CD</b> <b>writer</b> drive, combo (CD-RW/DVD-ROM) drive, and DVD writer drive supporting certain recordable and rewritable DVD formats (such as DVD-R(W) only, DVD+R(W) only, DVD-RAM only, and all DVD formats except DVD-R DL). , DVD writer drive supporting all existing recordable and rewritable DVD formats is the most common for desktop PCs and laptops. There are also the DVD-ROM drive, BD-ROM drive, Blu-ray Disc combo (BD-ROM/DVD±RW/CD-RW) drive, and Blu-ray Disc writer drive.|$|E

5000|$|ModulArt {{in a new}} {{composing}} methodology theorized {{and applied}} to music by Stefano Vagnini. The modular composition system extends its procedure to compositions licensed by the musician as completed works of art. To these compositions one can overlap new modules. The new modules can be added by the same author in a different moment or by different authors. Greek History University Professor Umberto Bultrighini describes [...] "Vagnini's ability to satisfy old needs and combine them with modern technology. ModulArt as the key answer to the need of defining the artist's work, finding the right balance between art, audience and copyrights". Stefano Vagnini's ModulArt is theorized and applied in a theoretical book, in a book + DVD of modular poems and a <b>cd.</b> <b>Writer,</b> painter, and art theorist Gian Ruggero Manzoni described the modularity of Vagnini's compositions as “circular like the existence, his works are not finished, but merely stimulus for new voices”.Vagnini's ModulArt in musical composition coincides and was developed independently {{during the same period}} of time with Leda Luss Luyken's ModulArt in the realm of painting. Both hold that the artist’s tools to creativity are virtually unlimited by way of ModulArt.|$|E
30|$|Other {{reasons are}} old fashion ideas that {{photography}} {{may increase the}} operation time or {{that it is time}} consuming in busy clinics to counsel our patients about it. However, these issues should not exist in modern gynaecological units. In minimal access surgery, handy system allow recording of photos and videos without any delay of the operation (via the main camera through laparoscope). We can check the quality of our photos/videos in order to keep high-quality data. Systems of a DVD recorder or <b>CD</b> <b>writer</b> are more and more cheep as the technology grows. A simple laptop with an internal connection can do the job. Storage of the data is technically very easy without excessive cost. More sophisticated systems can be found in research units and big university hospitals in the UK.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is aimed at {{assessing}} extent of utilization and familiarity in accessing digital technologies of information among post graduate students in Shiraz city. A total of 97 respondents (31 PG students and 66 Research scholars) {{were randomly selected from}} the city of Shiraz. A questionnaire measuring usage of various digital technologies and accessing digital resources was prepared by the investigator and administered to the sample selected. Statistical methods like chi-square and contingency table analysis were employed. Results revealed that in the extent of use of digital technologies, CD browsing usage 40. 2 % to an extent of 50 %, in internet searching 42. 3 % of used 100 %, telefax was used very less (about 86 % to an extent of less than 50 %), and laser scanner used less (about 83 % less than 50 %). Printers as digital technologies were used more (74 % of used more than 75 %), <b>CD</b> <b>writer</b> (about 65 % to an extent of less than 50 %), LCD pad/data projector very less (about 83 % less than 50 %), and online catalogue search (about 70 % less than 50 %). Research scholars used more of CD browsing, telefax, CD writers, LCD pad/data projectors, where as students used more printers. In familiarity with accessing digital sources, more familiarity was found in journals on internet and less familiarity was observed for encyclopedia on net, directories and yellow pages and digital libraries. The selected sample had more familiarity with book search and book shops on net, internet relay chatting and email and less of teleconferencing on the net. Research scholars had higher familiarity with book search and book shops on internet than students...|$|E
