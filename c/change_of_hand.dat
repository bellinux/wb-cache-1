40|$|The parietal {{mechanisms}} {{for the control}} of hand movement trajectory were studied by recording cell activity in area 5 of monkeys making direct reaches to visual targets and online corrections of movement trajectory, after change of target location in space. The activity of hand-related cells was fitted with a linear model including hand position, movement direction, and speed. The neural activity modulation mostly led, but also followed, hand movement. When a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> trajectory occurred, the pattern of activity associated with the movement to the first target evolved into that typical of the movement to the second one, thus following the corresponding variations of the hand kinematics. The visual signal concerning target location in space did not influence the firing activity associated with the direction of hand movement within the first 150 ms after target presentation. This might be the time necessary for the visuo-motor transformation underlying reaching. We conclude that online control of hand trajectory not only resides in the relationships between neural activity and kinematics, but, under specific circumstances, also on the coexistence of signals about ongoing and future hand movement direction...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} whether combining mental practice with physical practice training enhances hand function {{in patients with}} stroke. Methods. 10 for treatment and 10 for control were recruited for this pre/posttraining matched case control study. In the treatment group, subjects underwent combining mental practice with physical practice for four weeks. In the control group, subjects only participated in physical practice. <b>Change</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> function {{and the number of}} activated voxels of the contralateral somatosensory motor cortex (SMC) acquired by functional magnetic resonance imaging were measured. Results. After training, the Action Research Arm Test score increased by 12. 65 for treatment and by 5. 20 for control. There was {{a significant difference in the}} Action Research Arm Test score between the two groups (P= 0. 04). The activated voxels number of the contralateral SMC increased in both groups, but the activated voxels number in the contralateral SMC and the improvement of hand function for treatment were greater than for control. In the treatment group, the number of activated voxels of the contralateral SMC was positively correlated with better hand function scores. Conclusions. Combining mental practice with physical practice may be a more effective treatment strategy than physical training alone for hand recovery in stroke patients...|$|E

40|$|Reading action-related verbs {{brings about}} {{sensorimotor}} neural activity, {{suggesting that the}} linguistic representation of actions impinges upon neural structures largely overlapping with those involved in actual action execution. While studies of direct action observation indicate that motor mirroring is inherently anticipatory, no information is currently available on whether deriving action-related knowledge from language also {{takes into account the}} temporal deployment of actions. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, here we sought to determine whether reading action verbs conjugated in the future induced higher cortico-spinal activity with respect to when the same verbs were conjugated in the past tense. We recorded motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from relaxed hand and leg muscles of healthy subjects who were reading silently hand- or leg-related action, sensorial (non-somatic) and abstract verbs conjugated either in future or past tense. The amplitude of MEPs recorded from the hand was higher during reading hand-related action verbs conjugated in the future than in the past. No future-related modulation of leg muscles activity was found during reading leg-related action verbs. In a similar vein, no future-related <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> or leg muscles reactivity was found for abstract or sensorial verbs. These results indicate that the anticipatory mirroring of hand actions may be triggered by linguistic representations and not only by direct action observation...|$|E
40|$|Despite wide spread {{use of the}} {{radial artery}} (RA) graft for {{coronary}} artery bypass grafting, the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> circulation after RA harvest has not been fully clarified. Severe hand ischemia such as resting pain or gangrene is a rare complication and {{has been reported in}} 4 patients. These cases resulted from occlusive artery disease in forearm, which should be carefully explored before RA har-vest. Incidence of mild hand ischemia such as hand claudication or fatigue is unknown, but our study suggested that around 10 % of the patients devel-oped mild hand ischemia after RA harvest. The blood flow to the forearm territory was decreased by 20 % after RA harvest despite the compensatory dilatation of ulnar artery. The presence of low per-fusion in the affected hand has been pointed out in some studies. We reported the decreased tissue oxygenation of the affected hand during hand grip exercise. The Allen test is the most popular preop-erative screening method, but is associated with considerable numbers of false-positive and false-negative results.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve car {{interior}} design, data of perceived discomfort and reach posture were collected for 75 different target locations. Altogether, 24 males and females of different statures participated in the experiment. In addition to three-finger grip, index fingertip reach and five finger grip were also compared. The effects of target location, stature and hand grip on reach discomfort were analysed. Predictive regression equations were provided. In addition to the confirmation of target location effects, {{the results showed that}} seat back and steering wheel affected discomfort. Their effects differed according to the subject's anthropometry. A detailed analysis of possible interference between the car interior and reach movement showed that short females were more likely impeded by the seat back when a target was close to the body.

40|$|Push-ups {{are widely}} used in public school {{physical}} education classes, and by military and law enforcement organizations to test upper body muscular fitness. The majority of the test protocols do not specify a hand position. Some {{research has demonstrated that}} hand positioning has a significant effect of on electromyographic activity of the working muscles, ground reaction forces and elbow joint loads during single or sub-maximal push-ups. However there are no scientific studies on how a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> positions would affect performance in a maximal push-up test to volitional exhaustion. This study examined performance in a maximal push-up test in each of four different hand positions: self-selected, wide, shoulder width and narrow. After the characteristics of the individual self-selected positions were determined and recorded, 36 subjects (15 females and 21 males) performed push-up trials {{in each of the four}} randomly selected positions on four non-consecutive days. The maximum number of correct push-ups was recorded and statistically analyzed. Female subjects were able to perform significantly more push-ups in the wide position than in the narrow or shoulder width position (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Male subjects performed significantly more push-ups in the wide position than in the self-selected, the shoulder width or the narrow position (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). The results of this study suggest that hand positioning can significantly affect the results of a push-up test and therefore should be controlled in such testing. ...|$|E

This study tests emotional dissonance – the demand to keep being polite to impolite customers – as an additional risk factor. Furthermore, sleep problems are expected to mediate the link between emotion work and musculoskeletal pain. Data contains 103 female supermarket cashiers from three supermarkets of a large retailer responded to a questionnaire (participation rate 60. 6 %). An open question asked for the most negative job facets in daily work. Standardized questionnaire were used to assess emotional dissonance, sleep problems and musculoskeletal pain. Responses to the open question showed experience of unkind customers as the most prevalent negative experience at work reported by 47. 6 % of cashiers, followed by prolonged sitting (8. 7 %). Emotional dissonance {{was a significant predictor of}} neck and back pain when BMI, age, part-time work, and <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> function during their shift (work rotation) were controlled (β =. 30, p <. 01).

40|$|Objective. To compare {{as proof}} of concept the {{sensitivity}} to change of automated quantification of radiographic wrist and hand joint space width (JSW) with scoring JSW according to the Sharp/van der Heijde scoring method (SHS) in two strategy groups of a treat-to-target and tight-control early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) study. Methods. Digital radiographs were assessed for JSW changes of 134 patients of the 236 patients participating in the second Computer Assisted Management in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis trial, of whom both baseline and year 2 radiographs were available (year 1 radiographs n = 125). Of those 134 patients, 70 started with methotrexate and prednisone (MTX + Pred) and 64 with MTX and placebo (MTX + Plac). JSW change over 1 and 2 years of the hands and wrists was assessed, applying both the joint space narrowing (JSN) subscore of the SHS by 2 readers and the automated assessment with the JSW quantification software 'JSQ'. For both methods, progression of JSW change of the hand and wrist was analysed using linear mixed modelling (dependent variable 'JSW', factor 'strategy group', covariate 'follow-up time in years', interaction term 'strategy group*follow-up time'; radiographs of baseline, year 1 and year 2 were used). For each method the standardised mean difference (SMD) for the change in JSW from baseline to year 2 between the treatment strategies was obtained using a non-parametric method. Results. Patient characteristics of the current subpopulation {{were similar to those}} of the whole study population. JSN of the hand and wrist according to SHS at 2 years was present in 16 vs. 23 % in the MTX+Pred group vs. the MTX+Plac group. The mean yearly progression rates of JSW change of the hands and wrists using JSQ were - 0. 00 mm (95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 01; 0. 01) for MTX + Pred vs. - 0. 02 mm (95 %CI - 0. 03; - 0. 01) for MTX + Plac, p= 0. 045, and using SHS JSN they were 0. 19 units (95 %CI 0. 09; 0. 30) vs. 0. 30 units (95 %CI 0. 14; 0. 45) for MTX + Pred vs. MTX + Plac, p = 0. 271. The SMD for the change from baseline to year 2 between the treatment strategies was 0. 37 for JSQ and 0. 13 for SHS JSN. Conclusion. In this proof of concept study the yearly progression rate of JSW <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>hand</b> and wrist joints, according to the automated JSW quantification software package 'JSQ', was higher in the group initiating MTX+Plac than in the group initiating MTX+Pred. A similar trend was seen with the JSN assessment according to the SHS method of the hand and wrist. However, JSN of the hand and wrist according to SHS, the current gold standard to assess radiographic progression, was seen in only about 20 %. Therefore, further studies are needed to conclude firmly that JSQ should be incorporated into quantitative scoring of radiographs in RA...|$|E
