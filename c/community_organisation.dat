500|$|Hagley's {{population}} {{increased significantly}} during the 1850s as people moved {{both to the}} village, and to farming properties in the district. A doctor was practicing in the area by 1854, and in 1855 a school opened in the Church of England; paid for with funds raised by local residents. That year a postal service began in Hagley. David Parry was appointed postmaster on 1 July 1855, probably operating an unofficial post office from the Hagley Inn. A post office officially opened on 10 June 1865, in a building that was demolished in 1970. This building also had a store called the [...] "six day store" [...] run by the postmaster and his wife. The town gained a second hotel in 1857 with Carmody's Meander Hotel, though this remained open {{for only a few}} years. [...] In 1857 also the town's first <b>community</b> <b>organisation</b> was formed, the Hagley Ploughing Association, and regular ploughing matches began.

The purpose of the proposed organisation was to facilitate and co-ordinate political programs that extended beyond the narrow confines of the power struggles taking place between the Greek Orthodox <b>Community</b> <b>organisations</b> and the Greek Church authorities in Australia. In our paper we will draw upon the history of the Confederation’s formation to show how the transnational discourse of the confederating <b>community</b> <b>organisations</b> on the one hand distinguished them from the Greek Orthodox <b>Community</b> <b>organisations</b> which relied upon an insular nationalist discourse and on the other drew them towards the internationally emerging human rights discourse of the time.

40|$|This study {{explored}} the discourses of partnership {{between government and}} <b>community</b> <b>organisations</b> during the term of the fifth Labour-led Government (1999 - 2008). This government came to power with a policy of building partnerships with <b>community</b> <b>organisations</b> and others, presenting partnership as {{a rejection of the}} contractual models of the previous administration. I drew on Foucauldian notions of discourse and governmentality and Gramsci’s theories of hegemony, together with poststructuralism and critical social theory for my theoretical and philosophical frameworks. Applying Fairclough’s (1992) critical discourse analytic approach as a research methodology, I examined the historical, social and political contexts that frame the discourse of partnership, and analysed three sets of texts from the period under review. Two dominant partnership discourses emerged. The first was a community development discourse that {{can be traced to the}} 1970 s, and which re-emerged in the 1990 s as a resistance to the then dominant contractualist discourses of relationship between government and <b>community</b> <b>organisations.</b> The second was a modification of contractualism that drew from third-way discourses out of the United Kingdom, and in which government projects and programmes that involve <b>community</b> <b>organisations</b> were reframed as partnerships while retaining contractual mechanisms and ways of thinking. Drawing on governmentality theory, I suggested that the language of partnership may mask a process in which <b>community</b> <b>organisations</b> were co-opted to take on roles and responsibilities that are ultimately determined by, and in the interests of the government agenda. The research also identified characteristics of genuine partnerships between government and <b>community</b> <b>organisations.</b> Such partnerships were generally framed within a community development discourse and were more resistant to co-optation than partnerships that followed a contractualist approach. This research provides tools and strategies to enable both <b>community</b> <b>organisations</b> and government officials develop and maintain effective working relationships...|$|R
