5000|$|Deletion of the {{intermediary}} shaft (Jackshaft) {{making the}} <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> a single stage chain {{as opposed to}} FW series' two stage gear/chain set up. This made the camshaft turn {{in the same direction}} as the crank.|$|E
5000|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this system is that it {{incorporates}} [...] "floating" [...] inlet <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> pulleys that are not directly keyed to the shafts. This means that special setting tools are required to establish the cam timing before the pulley fixings are tightened. This requirement {{is the result of}} the complexity of the <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> train. In addition to the length and thickness tolerance of the belts, the accuracy of the cam timing is also affected by the positional and diameter tolerance of each pulley and the thickness of each major engine casting. The result is that the required degree of timing accuracy could not otherwise be maintained.|$|E
50|$|The {{intake valve}} was {{automatic}} (actuated by atmospheric pressure) and the exhaust valve was <b>cam</b> <b>driven.</b>|$|R
50|$|No.1 MTB :0.75-inch bore and stroke, with <b>cam</b> <b>driven</b> {{slide valve}} gear. Available as a {{complete}} engine or a set of castings. Weight 2 lb.|$|R
50|$|Cam {{wakes up}} to find Lucy {{standing}} over her. Marcus had killed Lou at Lucy's request and only grazed Cam with his shot so she could fake her death. <b>Cam</b> <b>drives</b> off in Lou's car with Lucy and the prize money.|$|R
50|$|Eccentric <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> systems {{operates}} {{through an}} eccentric disc mechanism which slows and speeds up the angular {{speed of the}} cam lobe during its rotation. Arranging the lobe to slow during its open period is equivalent to lengthening its duration.|$|E
50|$|A second {{version of}} the engine {{retained}} the <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> from the pistons, but now had the cylinder block fixed in place with the cam ring rotating in the function of a crankshaft. This is illustrated in the NACA report, but not described in the text. The original roller followers for each piston were later replaced by plain bearings.|$|E
5000|$|... 1992: The CB400 Super Four {{introduced}} the updated CB-1 engine, tilted backwards {{to obtain a}} more erect cylinder bank. Carburetors changed from down-draft to side-draft type, but still CV. A more conventional chain drive system replaced the gear <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> system, setting the red-line at 12,500 rpm. Wider gear ratios defined the versatility of Honda's intention for the bike.|$|E
5000|$|... 3SFSE was {{a direct}} {{injection}} engine with Toyota D4 system. A <b>cam</b> <b>driven</b> high pressure fuel pump is at the #4 end of the head. This engine was only released in Japan (some imported to Russia etc.), and used in Camry (Windom).|$|R
50|$|The engine uses a Bosch high {{pressure}} direct injection fuel system with fuel pressure provided by two, <b>cam</b> <b>driven</b> {{high pressure}} pumps which {{are driven by}} a dedicated camshaft. The high pressure pumps supply the fuel rails which in turn supply the three injectors for that bank with fuel at a controlled pressure.|$|R
50|$|A {{variable}} geometry turbomachine uses movable vanes {{to regulate}} the flow. Vane angles are varied using <b>cams</b> <b>driven</b> by servo motor (actuator). In large installations involving many thousands of kilowatts and where operating conditions fluctuate, sophisticated systems of control are incorporated. Thus variable geometry turbomachine offer a better match of efficiency with changing flow conditions.|$|R
50|$|In 1964 the Australian/New Zealand Tasman Series {{was created}} with a 2500cc {{capacity}} limit applied to engines. Jack Brabham approached Repco {{to develop a}} suitable engine, and together they decided to base the SOHC design on Oldsmobile Jetfire 215 ci block with six cylinder-head studs per cylinder. Combined with a short stroke flat-plane crankshaft, Repco designed cylinder heads, camshafts and two-stage chain/gear <b>cam</b> <b>drive,</b> a 2.5L engine was built in 1965 with its cylinder head cast by Commonwealth Aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The D11 is a [...] pushrod, {{three main}} bearing, {{inline-four}} with wedge combustion chambers, and a {{bore and stroke}} of 73 mm × 68 mm (2.874 × 2.677 in), a compression ratio of 8:1, and was rated at [...] at 2880 rpm (D11-PU 41-U model). It weighed 137.5 kg. Similar to the E & J series, and Austin A series in layout, it had a gear-driven <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> similar to the larger SD series diesels; it was used in Datsun FG003 forklifts in the 1960s {{and then in the}} NFG101C forklift in the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|The 748 cc Mk.I VFR750 was {{introduced}} in 1985, and was over-engineered {{in a bid to}} re-establish a reputation for reliability. It had an alloy beam frame, gear driven cams. The Mk.IA changed wheel sizes from 16" [...] front & 18" [...] rear to 17" [...] front and rear, and the fairing was slightly modified. After this was a series of VFR750 models which featured various innovations, including a single-sided swingarm, linked braking, ABS, and VTEC. In due course the geared <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> was dropped in favour of cheaper chain-drive.|$|E

50|$|In 1958 Porsche made {{application}} for a German Patent, also applied for and published as British Patent GB861369 in 1959. The Porsche patent used an oscillating cam to increase the valve lift and duration. The desmodromic <b>cam</b> <b>driven</b> via a push/pull rod from an eccentric shaft or swashplate. It is unknown if any working prototype was ever made.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{included}} {{a number of}} otherwise advanced features. For instance, the valves were powered by dual overhead <b>cams</b> <b>driven</b> by power shafts {{at the rear of}} the engine. Exhaust ports were arranged to exit toward the middle of the engine, one cylinder bank being the mirror of the other, allowing the piping to be ganged below the engine nacelle.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, base Camaros in California were {{equipped}} with a new 3800 Series II engine for emissions compliance while base Camaros sold elsewhere retained the 3.4 L engine. This {{would be the last}} year the 3.4 L V6 engine would be available. For the LT1-powered Camaros, the often-problematic Opti-spark distributor was updated to include a vent to remove moisture from the unit. The <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> system for the distributor was also changed, making [...] "early" [...] & [...] "late" [...] model cams and distributors non-interchangeable. 1995 was also the first year the fourth-generation Camaro had the option of painted side bars and mirrors. Traction control became available as an option on LT1 Camaros, but was installed on the base Camaros. Z28 rooftops, door handles, and mirrors, which were previously only available in black, now had the option to be painted the same as the body color.|$|E
5000|$|The Ducati 860 GT was a Ducati {{motorcycle}} made in 1974 and 1975, {{replaced by}} the restyled 860 GTS for 1976-1979. In 1974-1975 the electric-start version was called the 860 GTE, while all models had electric start after 1975, and for the final two years, 1978-1979, the name was changed to 900 GTS. A USA market variant was made in all model years, in which the gearshift was [...] "crudely moved" [...] from the right {{to the left side}} of the engine by means an external rod.The 860 series used the engine and stressed member frame of Fabio Taglioni's original 750 GT L twin, with bevel <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> and with the enlarged capacity achieved by using two of the Ducati 450 single-cylinder engine’s sleeves and pistons. The controversial angular design of the cosmetic elements was by noted car stylist Giorgio Giugiaro. Giugiaro dispensed with both the sinuous tank shape and engine covers, and added large steel side covers to create an overall integrated effect. The upright seating position was intended for urban riding rather than the sporting leaning over position of the earlier 750.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the more}} sporty {{high-performance}} engines use the four bearing design because of better torsional stiffness (e.g., BMW small straight 6, Ford's Zephyr 6). The accumulated length of main bearing journals gives a relatively torsionally flexible crankshaft. The four main bearing design has only six crank throws and four main journals, so is much stiffer in the torsional domain. At high engine speeds, the lack of torsional stiffness can make the seven main bearing design susceptible to torsional flex and potential breakage. Another factor affecting large straight-six engines is the end-mounted timing chain which connects any camshafts to the crankshaft. The camshafts are also quite long and subject to torsional flex as they in turn operate valves alternately {{near the front of}} the engine and near the rear. At high engine speeds, camshafts can flex torsionally in addition to the crankshaft, contributing to valve timing for the cylinders furthest from the <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> becoming inaccurate and erratic, losing power, and in extreme cases resulting in mechanical interference between valve and piston — with catastrophic results. Some designers have experimented with installing the timing chain/gears {{in the middle of the}} engine (between cylinders 3 and 4) or adding a second timing chain at the rear of the engine. Either method can solve the problem at the cost of additional complexity.|$|E
50|$|The valves {{are driven}} from an {{eccentric}} cam mounted {{on one of}} the driving axles and linkage from the crosshead. The driving axle <b>cam</b> <b>drives</b> a rocking shaft that is mounted inside a cylindrical sleeve (known as the rocking shaft bush) above the cylinder. A drop lever and connecting link from the crosshead oscillates the sleeve to control the lap and lead of the cylinder.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{four-stroke}} engines {{have used}} a mechanically timed electrical ignition system. The heart {{of the system is}} the distributor. The distributor contains a rotating <b>cam</b> <b>driven</b> by the engine's drive, a set of breaker points, a condenser, a rotor and a distributor cap. External to the distributor is the ignition coil, the spark plugs and wires linking the distributor to the spark plugs and ignition coil. (see diagram Below) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to design and {{construct}} a six legged walking robot. An innovative <b>cam</b> <b>driven</b> leg system was designed, constructed and tested with success. Hobby servo motors were used for positioning the legs, and were controlled using four networked 68 HC 11 microcontrollers in a master slave configuration. All components of the system are functioning properly and should require a minimum of additional work to produce a functional walking robot platform...|$|R
5000|$|All of the D.III series were {{generally}} {{very similar to}} other models, {{with the exception of}} the piston profile, carburetor details and valvetrain details. It appears that upgrades were available for many of the engines, certainly for the III to IIIa, and IIIa to IIIaü. It would seem unlikely that early III's would ever make it to the IIIaü standard, as they would almost certainly have been worn out in service before then. The valvetrain changes concerned the layout of the rocker arms that operated the valves. Early models had square rocker boxes positioned directly over the cylinders with the rocker arms exiting through vertical slots, one cut into each of the opposing sides of the boxes, as shown at left. The earlier [...] "side-slot" [...] rocker arm design had also been used for the Mercedes D.I and D.II engines' valvetrains. In later versions of the D.III engines, the boxes were relocated rearward on the tubular camshaft housing, and the now easily-sealable cylindrical rocker arm shafts protruded forwards through the front surfaces of the boxes, operating the now fully exposed rocker arms with the exposed shaft ends, as shown at right. The newer arrangement was stated as being interchangeable as a set with the complete camshaft, rocker boxes, rocker arms and valve springs, with the D.III's earlier [...] "side-slot" [...] <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> system design - the later system seems to have influenced both Packard's and Hall-Scott's engine designers to adopt a nearly identical [...] "slotless" [...] valvetrain design feature for the Liberty L-12 Allied V-12 aviation engine.|$|E
5000|$|The {{nameplates}} FX35 and FX45 {{refer to}} the two available engines. The FX35 is available in two drivetrains, the RWD and the AWD, which are both fitted to a dual overhead cam 3.5-liter 24-valve V6 VQ35DE gasoline engine, with aluminum-alloy block and heads, electronically controlled throttle system, and low-friction molybdenum-coated pistons that makes use of the continuous variable valve timing which in part optimizes the opening of intake valves. This is also coupled with an electronically controlled super-wide ratio five-speed automatic with a manumatic shift mode that includes the option of sequentially selected manual gearshifts and downshift rev matching.The FX45 incorporates a 4.5-liter (4,494 cc) 32-valve V8 DOHC VK45DE gasoline engine with four valves per cylinder, microfinished camshafts with aluminum-alloy block and heads, low-friction molybdenum-coated pistons, titanium intake and exhaust valves, modular cylinder heads, microfinished crankshaft, lightweight pistons, super-silent single stage <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> chain, and a Continuously Variable Valve Timing Control System that optimizes opening of intake valves. Development began in 1999 under newly appointed CEO Carlos Ghosn's NRP. Design work was completed in rapid succession in 2000, for late 2002 production. Designed prior to that, earlier on in 2000 under the [...] "Bionic Cheetah" [...] theme, the 2001 Infiniti FX45 Concept was introduced at the NAIAS in January 2001. From mid-2001, a new concept based on the production design was developed and completed in late 2001. Sketches were first released in late November 2001. The second-generation 2002 FX45 Concept was introduced in January 2002 at the NAIAS '02 as a thinly-veiled production FX (S50) and planned production was announced for early 2003. In January 2003, the 2003 FX45 made its debut at the 2003 NAIAS and went on sale January 24, 2003.|$|E
40|$|Bionic quadruped robots {{received}} considerable worldwide research attention. For a quadruped robot {{walking with}} steady paces {{on a flat}} terrain, using a <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> control mechanism instead of servomotors provides theoretical and practical benefits as it reduces the system weight, cost, and control complexities; thus {{it may be more}} cost beneficial for some recreational or household applications. This study explores the robot step mechanism including the leg and <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> control systems based on studying the bone structure and the kinematic step sequences of dog. The design requirements for the <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> robot legs have been raised, and the mechanical principles of the leg operating mechanism as well as the control parameters have been analyzed. A <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> control system was constructed using three cams to control each leg.

5000|$|GM used cast {{aluminum}} cylinder heads featuring 4 valves per cylinder. The heads used dual overhead <b>cams</b> <b>driven</b> through the [...] "maintenance-free" [...] cam-drive chain case. The cams act directly on hydraulic lifters {{on the ends}} of the valves and are fed with a lubrication passage drilled through the cylinder head lengthwise. The intake valves are inclined at 25°, while the exhaust valves are canted to 7° with center-mounted platinum-tipped spark plugs. The cam covers are magnesium for light weight and sound damping.|$|R
50|$|VFR400 engines {{produce a}} {{noticeable}} whine when {{the engine is}} running, due to the <b>cams</b> being <b>driven</b> by straight cut gears, rather than chains or belts.|$|R
50|$|They are <b>cam</b> <b>driven,</b> and {{injection}} pressure {{is proportional to}} engine speed. This typically means that the highest {{injection pressure}} can only be achieved at the highest engine speed and the maximum achievable injection pressure decreases as engine speed decreases. This relationship is true with all pumps, even those used on common rail systems. With unit or distributor systems, the injection pressure {{is tied to the}} instantaneous pressure of a single pumping event with no accumulator, and thus the relationship is more prominent and troublesome.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. According to the {{engineering}} requirement of extruder, a new spatial worm <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> and its corresponding design method due to mechanism’s special use requires were introduced. In this paper, the worm cam’s axes and the index plate’s axes were vertical. It {{is the main}} purpose that the index plate with pin rotated without lash, while the worm cam rotated with the same speed in a certain speed. When the transmission ratio was i, the follower rotated by an angle in different speed intermittently without impact as the driving part made one rotation in the same speed. In this paper, non-impact is in the condition which the driven work in the principle of sinusoidal acceleration and the worm cam’s design equation will be provided...|$|E

50|$|For {{lightness}} and compactness; design optimization, material optimization, and component integration {{were identified}} as effective means of minimizing weight and bulk, so they were comprehensively effected in combination with each other. With regard to materials, the cylinder block is made of aluminum; the cylinder-head cover and intake manifold are made of plastic; the exhaust manifold has a pipe-based structure and <b>cams</b> <b>driven</b> by a timing chain.
