They {{were used in the}} present study to analyse the impact of microbial population dynamics on growth of Listeria monocytogenes in cheese microcosm. Specific culture media and PCR primers were developed for simultaneous culture-dependent and real-time PCR quantification of strains belonging to Marinomonas sp., Paenibacillus sp., Staphylococcus equorum, Arthrobacter arilaitensis, Pseudomonas putida, Serratia liquefaciens, Candida natalensis, and Geotrichum candidum, in cheese microcosms. All strains were enumerated after 3, 5, 8 and 14 days at 15 C. They established well at high counts in all cheese microcosms. Growth dynamics for all strains in presence of L. monocytogenes WSLC 1685 were compared to those of microbial communities obtained by omitting in turn one of the six members of the initial community. The growth of the microbial strains was neither markedly disturbed by Listeria presence nor by the removal of each strain in turn. Furthermore, these communities had a significant reducing effect on growth of L. monocytogenes independently of pH, as confirmed by mathematical modelling. A barrier effect was observed, that could be explained by specific competition for nutrients...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Surface {{contamination}} of <b>smear</b> <b>cheese</b> by Listeria spp. is of major {{concern for the}} industry. Complex smear ecosystems {{have been shown to}} harbor antilisterial potential but the microorganisms and mechanisms involved in the inhibition mostly remain unclear, and are likely related to complex interactions than to production of single antimicrobial compounds. Bacterial biodiversity and population dynamics of complex smear ecosystems exhibiting antilisterial properties in situ were investigated by Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE), a culture independent technique, for two microbial consortia isolated from commercial Raclette type cheeses inoculated with defined commercial ripening cultures (F) or produced with an old-young smearing process (M). Results TTGE revealed nine bacterial species common to both F and M consortia, but consortium F exhibited a higher diversity than consortium M, with thirteen and ten species, respectively. Population dynamics were studied after application of the consortia on fresh-produced Raclette cheeses. TTGE analyses revealed a similar sequential development of the nine species common to both consortia. Beside common cheese surface bacteria (Staphylococcus equorum, Corynebacterium spp., Brevibacterium linens, Microbacterium gubbeenense, Agrococcus casei), the two consortia contained marine lactic acid bacteria (Alkalibacterium kapii, Marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans) that developed early in ripening (day 14 to 20), shortly after the growth of staphylococci (day 7). A decrease of Listeria counts was observed on cheese surface inoculated at day 7 with 0. 1 - 1 × 10 2 CFU cm - 2, when <b>cheeses</b> were <b>smeared</b> with consortium F or M. Listeria counts went below the detection limit of the method between day 14 and 28 and no subsequent regrowth was detected over 60 to 80 ripening days. In contrast, Listeria grew to high counts (10 5 CFU cm - 2) on <b>cheeses</b> <b>smeared</b> with a defined surface culture. Conclusions This work reports the first population dynamics study of complex smear ecosystems exhibiting in situ antilisterial activity. TTGE revealed the presence of marine lactic acid bacteria that are likely related to the strong Listeria inhibition, as their early development in the smear occurred simultaneously with a decrease in Listeria cell count. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{undefined}} microbial floras {{derived from}} the surface of ripe cheese which are used for the ripening of commercial red <b>smear</b> <b>cheeses</b> have a strong impact on the growth of Listeria spp. In some cases, these microbial consortia inhibit Listeria almost completely. From such undefined industrial cheese-ripening floras, linocin M 18 -producing (lin+) (N. Valdés-Stauber and S. Scherer, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 60 : 3809 - 3814, 1994) and -nonproducing Brevibacterium linens strains were isolated and used as single-strain starter cultures on model red <b>smear</b> <b>cheeses</b> to evaluate their potential inhibitory effects on Listeria strains in situ. On cheeses ripened with lin+ strains, a growth reduction of L. ivanovii and L. monocytogenes of 1 to 2 log units was observed compared to cheeses ripened with lin strains. Linocin M 18 activity was detected in cheeses ripened with lin+ strains but was not found in those ripened with lin strains. We suggest that production of linocin M 18 contributes to the growth reduction of Listeria observed on model red <b>smear</b> <b>cheeses</b> but is unsufficient to explain the almost complete inhibition of Listeria caused by some undefined microbial floras {{derived from the}} surface of ripe cheeses...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cheese</b> <b>smearing</b> is {{a complex}} process and the {{potential}} for cross-contamination with pathogenic or undesirable microorganisms is critical. During ripening, cheeses are salted and washed with brine to develop flavor and remove molds that could develop on the surfaces. Considering the potential for cross-contamination of this process in quantitative risk assessments could contribute {{to a better understanding of}} this phenomenon and, eventually, improve its control. The purpose of this article is to model the cross-contamination of smear-ripened cheeses due to the smearing operation under industrial conditions. A compartmental, dynamic, and stochastic model is proposed for mechanical brush smearing. This model has been developed to describe the exchange of microorganisms between compartments. Based on the analytical solution of the model equations and on experimental data collected with an industrial smearing machine, we assessed the values of the transfer parameters of the model. Monte Carlo simulations, using the distributions of transfer parameters, provide the final number of contaminated products in a batch and their final level of contamination for a given scenario taking into account the initial number of contaminated cheeses of the batch and their contaminant load. Based on analytical results, the model provides indicators for smearing efficiency and propensity of the process for cross-contamination. Unlike traditional approaches in mechanistic models, our approach captures the variability and uncertainty inherent in the process and the experimental data. More generally, this model could represent a generic base to use in modeling similar processes prone to cross-contamination...|$|R

A total of 404 yeasts were screened for inhibitory activity against five Listeria monocytogenes strains. Three hundred and four of these yeasts were isolated from smear-ripened cheeses. Most of the yeasts were identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Using an agar-membrane screening assay, a fraction of approximately 4 % of the 304 red <b>smear</b> <b>cheese</b> isolates clearly inhibited growth of L. monocytogenes. Furthermore, 14 out of these 304 cheese yeasts were cocultivated with L. monocytogenes WSLC 1364 on solid medium to test the antilisterial activity of yeast in direct cell contact with Listeria. All yeasts inhibited L. monocytogenes to a low degree, which is most probably due to competition for nutrients. However, one Candida intermedia strain was able to reduce the listerial cell count by 4 log units. Another four yeasts, assigned to C. intermedia (three strains) and Kluyveromyces marxianus (one strain), repressed growth of L. monocytogenes by 3 log units. Inhibition of L. monocytogenes was clearly pronounced in the cocultivation assay, which simulates the conditions and contamination rates present on <b>smear</b> <b>cheese</b> surfaces.

Compared to monoculture, L. monocytogenes growth rate in co-culture was not reduced but the growth of the pathogen stopped as soon as BM entered the stationary phase. This reduction in maximum population density can be explained by nutrient consumption and exhaustion by BM as no production of inhibitors by BM has been detected.

The inhibition was due to pediocin AcH added together with the L. plantarum culture to the brine solution but not to bacteriocin production in situ on cheese. Pediocin resistance developed in vitro at different but high frequencies in all 12 L. monocytogenes strains investigated, and a resistant mutant remained stable in a microbial surface ripening consortium over a 4 -month production process in the absence of selection pressure.

All of the coryneforms, except M. gubbeenense, grew in 12 % salt, while B. aurantiacum and S. saprophyticus grew in 15 % salt. All five bacteria assimilated lactate in a semisynthetic medium, and none of the coryneform bacteria assimilated lactose. Glucose assimilation was poor, except by S. saprophyticus and C. casei. Five to seven amino acids were assimilated by the coryneforms and 12 by S. saprophyticus. Glutamate, phenylalanine, and proline were utilized by all five bacteria, whereas utilization of serine, threonine, aspartate, histidine, alanine, arginine, leucine, isoleucine, and glycine depended on the organism. Growth of C. casei restarted after addition of glutamate, proline, serine, and lactate {{at the end of the}} exponential phase, indicating that these amino acids and lactate can be used as energy sources. Pantothenic acid was essential for the growth of C. casei and M. gubbeenense. Omission of biotin reduced the growth of B. aurantiacum, C. casei, and M. gubbeenense.

To gain a better understanding of molecular adaptation due to low pH induced by lactose fermentation, the global gene expression profile of Corynebacterium glutamicum adapted to pH 5. 7 with lactic acid under continuous growth in a chemostat was characterized by DNA microarray analysis. Expression of a total of 116 genes was increased and that of 90 genes was decreased compared to pH 7. 5 without lactic acid, representing 7 % of the genes in the genome. The up-regulated genes encode mainly transcriptional regulators, proteins responsible for export, import, and metabolism, and several proteins of unknown function. As much as 45 % of the up-regulated open reading frames code for hypothetical proteins. These results were validated using real-time reverse transcription-PCR. To characterize the functions of 38 up-regulated genes, 36 single-crossover disruption mutants were generated and analyzed for their lactic acid sensitivities. However, only a sigB knockout mutant showed a highly significant negative effect on growth at low pH, suggesting a function in organic-acid adaptation. A sigE mutant already displayed growth retardation at neutral pH but grew better at acidic pH than the sigB mutant. The lack of acid-sensitive phenotypes in 34 out of 36 disrupted genes suggests either a considerable redundancy in acid adaptation response or coincidental effects. Other up-regulated genes included genes for ion transporters and metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate and respiratory metabolism. The enhanced expression of the nrd (ribonucleotide reductase) operon and a DNA ATPase repair protein implies a cellular response to combat acid-induced DNA damage. Surprisingly, multiple iron uptake systems (totaling 15 % of the genes induced ≥ 2 -fold) were induced at low pH.

DNA banding profiles (ramdom amplified polymorphic DNA [RAPD]-PCR) of all the coryneform isolates showed large numbers of clusters. However, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of the isolates from the cheeses showed that all isolates within a cluster and in many contiguous clusters were the same. The inoculated and noninoculated cheeses were dominated by single clones of novel species of Corynebacterium casei (50. 2 % of isolates), Corynebacterium mooreparkense (26 % of isolates), and Microbacterium gubbeenense (12. 8 % of isolates). In addition, five of the isolates from the inoculated cheese were Corynebacterium flavescens.

It is also commercially available as an adjunct culture to enhance the aroma and texture of cheeses, as well as the color of the surface of <b>smeared</b> <b>cheeses.</b> The molecular mechanisms allowing the growth and adaptation of S. xylosus in the dairy products are still poorly understood. A microarray representing the S. xylosus C 2 a genome was used to determine how the gene expression profile was modified during growth and adaptation to a cheese model. The C 2 a strain was inoculated at 5. 6 log CFU/g in ultra filtered milk concentrated 5. 5 -fold and supplemented with UHT cream and salt. Then rennet was added. The temperature of incubation was decreased from 30 °C to 12 °C after 10 hours of culture, to mimic the temperature shift generally encountered during cheese making. The growth of S. xylosus in the cheese model was exponential until 5 hours and reached a maximum of 8. 7 log CFU/g at 24 h. S. xylosus population remained almost at this population level after 48 hours of incubation. Total RNA extractions were performed directly from the solid dairy matrix inoculated with S. xylosus after 6, 24 and 48 hours of incubation. Compared to the 6 hours time point sampling, more than 1000 genes of S. xylosuswere differentially expressed at 24 and/or 48 hours of incubation. In particular, extensive upregulation of genes involved in the biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, aromatic amino acids and arginine was observed. This work generates a comprehensive genome-wide picture of what genes are modulated during S. xylosus growth and adaptation to a cheese model. Our study increases the understanding of the physiology of adjunct culture in the first step of cheese making process...|$|R
40|$|Contamination of some {{varieties}} of soft <b>smear</b> <b>cheeses</b> with Listeria monocytogenes {{is an important}} problem for the consumer's health, leading to industrial substantial financial losses. Especially smear and soft traditional Italian cheeses such as Taleggio and Gorgonzola, may be risk products from a listeriosis point of view since they constitute a suitable medium for growth of L. monocytogenes. For this reason there is considerable interest in developing microbial ripening consortia which display anti-listerial activity. In this study, 42 Lactobacillus strain isolated from different traditional Italian cheeses surface (Taleggio, Gorgonzola, Casera Valtellina, Scimudin and Formaggio di Fossa) were analyzed {{for their ability to}} produce anti-listeria substances. Lactobacillus sakei, L. curvatus, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, L. paracasei, L. casei, L. acidophillus and L. acidipiscis, were preliminary screening by an agar spot test and the well diffusion assays. PCR was also performed to search the presence of bacteriocin encoding genes. Although inhibitory activity against L. monocytogenes was detected for all isolates by the agar stop test, the number of positive strains was severely reduced, when the neutralized cell-free supernatants (CFS) were subjected to the well-diffusion assay resulting much less inhibitory against L. monocytogenes. The preliminary characterization of the antimicrobial substances present on the CFS revealed high thermo stability while the sensibility to the treatment with trypsin, proteinase K and papain was different and strain dependent. Based on our results we found 14 news bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strains, belong to the genera L. curvatus (8), L. plantarum (2), L. rhamnosus (1), L. casei (1), L. acidophillus (1) and L. acidipiscis (1). According to trycine–SDS–PAGE, these inhibitory actives molecules are approximately 2. 5 - 7 kDa in size. PCR- based analysis demonstrated a great diversity among bacteriocin genes presents in different microorganism isolated from the same source. Interestingly some strains carried bacteriocin structural genes from not related genus demonstrating the factibility of horizontal gene transfer among bacterial populations in the same food matrix. Beyond the use of bacteriocins as functional ingredients for the biopreservation of foods, the newly identified bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strains from traditional cheeses may also be useful for designing starter cultures with protective properties...|$|R
40|$|Comprehensive {{collaborative}} {{studies from}} our laboratories reveal the extensive biodiversity of the microflora of {{the surfaces of}} smear-ripened cheeses. Two thousand five hundred ninety-seven strains of bacteria and 2, 446 strains of yeasts {{from the surface of}} the smear-ripened cheeses Limburger, Reblochon, Livarot, Tilsit, and Gubbeen, isolated at three or four times during ripening, were identified; 55 species of bacteria and 30 species of yeast were found. The microfloras of the five cheeses showed many similarities but also many differences and interbatch variation. Very few of the commercial smear microorganisms, deliberately inoculated onto the cheese surface, were reisolated and then mainly from the initial stages of ripening, implying that <b>smear</b> <b>cheese</b> production units must have an adventitious "house" flora. Limburger cheese had the simplest microflora, containing two yeasts, Debaryomyces hansenii and Geotrichum candidum, and two bacteria, Arthrobacter arilaitensis and Brevibacterium aurantiacum. The microflora of Livarot was the most complicated, comprising 10 yeasts and 38 bacteria, including many gram-negative organisms. Reblochon also had a very diverse microflora containing 8 yeasts and 13 bacteria (excluding gram-negative organisms which were not identified), while Gubbeen had 7 yeasts and 18 bacteria and Tilsit had 5 yeasts and 9 bacteria. D. hansenii was by far the dominant yeast, followed in order by G. candidum, Candida catenulata, and Kluyveromyces lactis. B. aurantiacum was the dominant bacterium and was found in every batch of the 5 cheeses. The next most common bacteria, in order, were Staphylococcus saprophyticus, A. arilaitensis, Corynebacterium casei, Corynebacterium variabile, and Microbacterium gubbeenense. S. saprophyticus was mainly found in Gubbeen, and A. arilaitensis was found in all cheeses but not in every batch. C. casei was found in most batches of Reblochon, Livarot, Tilsit, and Gubbeen. C. variabile was found in all batches of Gubbeen and Reblochon but in only one batch of Tilsit and in no batch of Limburger or Livarot. Other bacteria were isolated in low numbers from each of the cheeses, suggesting that each of the 5 cheeses has a unique microflora. In Gubbeen cheese, several different strains of the dominant bacteria were present, as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and many of the less common bacteria were present as single clones. The culture-independent method, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, resulted in identification of several bacteria which were not found by the culture-dependent (isolation and rep-PCR identification) method. It was thus a useful complementary technique to identify other bacteria in the cheeses. The gross composition, the rate of increase in pH, and the indices of proteolysis were different in most of the cheeses...|$|R
