5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one <b>CNS</b> <b>depressant</b> were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from midazolam administration {{are expected to have}} a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|E
5|$|Nonbenzodiazepines are {{contraindicated}} during benzodiazepine withdrawal as {{they are}} cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence. Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another. During withdrawal, fluoroquinolone-based antibiotics are best avoided if possible; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and, thus, may aggravate withdrawal symptoms. Antipsychotics are not recommended for benzodiazepine withdrawal (or other <b>CNS</b> <b>depressant</b> withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.|$|E
25|$|High-alcohol liquor, {{two forms}} of which {{were found in the}} US Pharmacopoeia up until 1916 and in common use by {{physicians}} well into the 1930s, has been used in the past as an agent for dulling pain, due to the <b>CNS</b> <b>depressant</b> effects of ethyl alcohol, a notable example being the American Civil War. However, the ability of alcohol to relieve severe pain is likely inferior to many analgesics used today (e.g., morphine, codeine). As such, in general, the idea of alcohol for analgesia is considered a primitive practice in virtually all industrialized countries today.|$|E
40|$|The UNODC {{publication}} Terminology and Information on Drugs introduces {{basic concepts}} and materials on substances under international control, which {{are most frequently}} manufactured or processed and/or abused, as well as definitions of scientific terms used in this context. The current revision of this publication is being prepared {{as a response to}} changes in drug markets and scheduling decisions of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in recent years. The publication is neither exhaustive, nor meant to replace more comprehensive textbooks on drugs of abuse. It seeks to collate basic concepts and information on drugs of abuse, their corresponding abuse patterns, pharmacological effects and potential medical use, and act as an accessible and user-friendly resource.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the potential role of non-invasive measurement of pharmacokinetics (pk) and pharmacodynamics (pd) {{in the research}} and development of central nervous system (<b>cns)</b> stimulants or <b>depressants</b> for children and adolescents. First, we evaluated the feasibility of using saliva as an alternative to plasma in two studies on psychostimulants (caffeine and methylphenidate). Second, neuropsychological and neurophysiological functions were measured longitudinally using the NeuroCart, a battery of tests developed at the Centre for Human Drug Research (chdr, Leiden, The Netherlands) that includes non-invasive tests for alertness, visuomotor coordination, motor control, memory, and subjective drug effects. Using a non-invasive approach, age-dependent differences in alcohol pk and pd were evaluated between healthy adolescents and adults. This thesis concludes with the report of two clinical trials that were designed to evaluate age-appropriate formulations of sedative drugs that have the potential for use in children. Promotores: A.

25|$|Consuming food {{prior to}} taking {{chlorpromazine}} orally limits its absorption, likewise cotreatment with benztropine can also reduce chlorpromazine absorption. Alcohol can also reduce chlorpromazine absorption. Antacids slow chlorpromazine absorption. Lithium and chronic treatment with barbiturates can increase chlorpromazine clearance significantly. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can decrease chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase chlorpromazine exposure. Cotreatment with CYP1A2 inhibitors like ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine or vemurafenib can reduce chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase exposure and potentially also adverse effects. Chlorpromazine can also potentiate the <b>CNS</b> <b>depressant</b> effects of drugs like barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids, lithium and anaesthetics and hence increase {{the potential for}} adverse effects such as respiratory depression and sedation.|$|E
25|$|Cases {{of severe}} {{overdose}} {{have been reported}} and symptoms displayed may include prolonged deep coma or deep cyclic coma, apnea, respiratory depression, hypoxemia, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, and pulmonary aspiration, {{with the possibility of}} death. Severe consequences are rare following overdose of benzodiazepines alone but the severity of overdose is increased significantly if benzodiazepines are taken in overdose in combination with other medications. Significant toxicity may result following recreation drug misuse in conjunction with other CNS depressants such as opioids or ethanol. The duration of symptoms following overdose is usually between 12 and 36 hours in the majority of cases. The majority of drug-related deaths involve misuse of heroin or other opioids in combination with benzodiazepines or other <b>CNS</b> <b>depressant</b> drugs. In most cases of fatal overdose it is likely that lack of opioid tolerance combined with the depressant effects of benzodiazepines is the cause of death.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of overdose is mostly supportive as no specific antidote for amitriptyline overdose is available. Activated charcoal may reduce absorption if given within 1–2 hours of ingestion. If the affected person is unconscious or has an impaired gag reflex, a nasogastric tube {{may be used}} to deliver the activated charcoal into the stomach. ECG monitoring for cardiac conduction abnormalities is essential and if one is found close monitoring of cardiac function is advised. Body temperature should be regulated with measures such as heating blankets if necessary. Likewise, cardiac arrhythmias can be treated with propranolol and should heart failure occur, digitalis may be used. Cardiac monitoring is advised for at least five days after the overdose. Amitriptyline increases the <b>CNS</b> <b>depressant</b> action, but not the anticonvulsant action of barbiturates; therefore, an inhalation anaesthetic or diazepam is recommended for control of convulsions. Dialysis is of no use due to the high degree of protein binding with amitriptyline.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin {{should not}} be used within 14days of using a monoamine oxidase {{inhibitor}} (MAOIs) such as phenelzine due to the potential for hypertensive crisis or serotonin syndrome to develop. Its use in those taking potent CYP2D6 inhibitors such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, bupropion, and quinidine is recommended against due to the potential for its accumulation in the absence of full CYP2D6 catalytic activity. Hepatic enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates are advised against in patients receiving TCAs like doxepin due to the potential for problematically rapid metabolism of doxepin to occur in these individuals. Sympathomimetic agents may have their effects potentiated by TCAs like doxepin. Doxepin also may potentiate the adverse effects of anticholinergic agents such as benztropine, atropine and hyoscine (scopolamine). Tolazamide, when used in conjunction with doxepin has been associated with a case of severe hypoglycaemia in a type II diabetic individual. Cimetidine may influence the absorption of doxepin. Alcohol may potentiate some of the <b>CNS</b> <b>depressant</b> effects of doxepin. Antihypertensive agents may have their effects mitigated by doxepin. Cotreatment with CNS depressants such as the benzodiazepines can cause additive CNS depression. Co-treatment with thyroid hormones may also increase the potential for adverse reactions.|$|E
2500|$|Triazolam (original {{brand name}} Halcion) {{is a central}} nervous system (<b>CNS)</b> <b>depressant</b> in the {{benzodiazepine}} class.

In addition to the hypnotic properties triazolam possesses, amnesic, anxiolytic, sedative, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant properties are pronounced [...] as well. Due to its short half-life, triazolam is not effective for patients who suffer from frequent awakenings or early wakening.|$|E

It may also interact with: ...|$|E
2500|$|A few {{species in}} the Amanita genus, most recognizably A. muscaria, but also A. pantherina, among others, contain the psychoactive {{compound}} muscimol. [...] The muscimol-containing chemotaxonomic group of Amanitas contains no amatoxins or phallotoxins, and as such are not hepatoxic, though if not properly cured will be non-lethally neurotoxic due {{to the presence of}} ibotenic acid. The Amanita intoxication is similar to Z-drugs in that it includes <b>CNS</b> <b>depressant</b> and sedative-hypnotic effects, but also dissociation and delirium in high doses.|$|E
2500|$|Bromazepam is {{commonly}} involved in drug overdoses. [...] A severe bromazepam benzodiazepine overdose {{may result in}} an alpha pattern coma type. The toxicity of bromazepam in overdosage increases when combined with other <b>CNS</b> <b>depressant</b> drugs such as alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs. Bromazepam {{is the most common}} benzodiazepine involved in intentional overdoses in France. Bromazepam has also been responsible for accidental poisonings in companion animals. A review of benzodiazepine poisonings in cats and dogs from 1991-1994 found bromazepam to be responsible for significantly more poisonings than any other benzodiazepine.|$|E
2500|$|Benzodiazepines are {{commonly}} abused by poly drug users, especially heroin addicts, alcoholics or amphetamine addicts when [...] "coming down". but sometimes are misused in isolation {{as the primary}} drug of misuse. They can be misused to achieve the high that benzodiazepines produce or more commonly {{they are used to}} either enhance the effects of other <b>CNS</b> <b>depressant</b> drugs, to stave off withdrawal effects of other drugs or combat the effects of stimulants. As many as 30–50% of alcoholics are also benzodiazepine misusers. Drug abusers often abuse high doses which makes serious benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms such as psychosis or convulsions more likely to occur during withdrawal.|$|E
2500|$|Methanol is toxic by two mechanisms. First, {{methanol}} (whether {{it enters}} the body by ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through the skin) can be fatal due to its <b>CNS</b> <b>depressant</b> properties {{in the same manner}} as ethanol poisoning. Second, in a process of toxication, it is metabolized to formic acid (which is present as the formate ion) via formaldehyde in a process initiated by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver. Methanol is converted to formaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and formaldehyde is converted to formic acid (formate) via aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). [...] The conversion to formate via ALDH proceeds completely, with no detectable formaldehyde remaining. Formate is toxic because it inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, causing hypoxia at the cellular level, and metabolic acidosis, among a variety of other metabolic disturbances.|$|E

50|$|Lorazepam's {{anticonvulsant}} and <b>CNS</b> <b>depressant</b> {{properties are}} useful for the treatment and prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In this setting, impaired liver function is not a hazard with lorazepam, since lorazepam does not require oxidation, hepatic or otherwise, for its metabolism.|$|E
50|$|In 1941, {{progesterone}} and 5β-pregnanedione {{were discovered}} to have <b>CNS</b> <b>depressant</b> effects in rodents. This began a search {{to make a}} synthetic steroid {{that could be used}} as an anesthetic. Most of these efforts were aimed at making alfaxalone more water-soluble.|$|E
50|$|Respiratory stimulants such as {{nikethamide}} were traditionally used {{to counteract}} respiratory depression from <b>CNS</b> <b>depressant</b> overdose, but offered limited effectiveness.

50|$|Permapanel {{reduced the}} {{effectiveness}} of levonorgestrel oral contraceptives by about 40%. Other antieptilectic drugs that induce cytochrome P450, including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and oxcarbazepine decrease the effectivenes of perampanel by 50-67%. Use of perampanel with strong CYP3A inducers like rifampin or St. John’s wort is not recommended.

5000|$|Methaqualone is a sedative-{{hypnotic}} drug {{similar in}} effect to barbiturates, a general <b>CNS</b> <b>depressant.</b> Its use peaked in the 1960s and 1970s as a hypnotic {{for the treatment}} of insomnia, and as a sedative and muscle relaxant.

50|$|As a {{side effect}} of {{medicines}} or recreational drugs, hypoventilation may become potentially life-threatening. Many different central nervous system (<b>CNS)</b> <b>depressant</b> drugs such as ethanol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, GHB, sedatives and opioids produce respiratory depression when taken in large or excessive doses, or mixed with other depressants. Strong opiates (such as fentanyl, heroin, or morphine), barbiturates, and certain benzodiazepines (short acting ones and alprazolam) are known for depressing respiration. In an overdose, an individual may cease breathing entirely (go into respiratory arrest) which is rapidly fatal without treatment. Opioids, in overdose or combined with other depressants, are notorious for such fatalities.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} uses of {{acepromazine}} in animals are as an oral sedative before stressful events (such as thunderstorms), an injectable tranquilizer for particularly aggressive or fractious animal, and {{when combined with}} opiates, a premedication or a post-operative pain reliever. Its effects as a <b>CNS</b> <b>depressant</b> means that less opiates are required to reach {{the same amount of}} sedation, and it prevents the arrhythmia and vomiting that many opiates induce. Its use as an oral sedative is somewhat controversial; acepromazine can increase sensitivity to noise and cause exaggerated startle reflexes. The dysphoric effect of phenothiazines and this increase in sensitivity can make some aggressive dogs and fractious cats more so.|$|E
