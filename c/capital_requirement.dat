25|$|In {{addition}} to reserve requirements, {{there are other}} required financial ratios that affect the amount of loans that a bank can fund. The <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> ratio {{is perhaps the most}} important of these other required ratios. When there are no mandatory reserve requirements, which are considered by some economists to restrict lending, the <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> ratio acts to prevent an infinite amount of bank lending.|$|E
25|$|The <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> is a bank regulation, {{which sets}} a {{framework}} within which a bank or depository institution must manage its balance sheet. The categorization of assets and capital is highly standardized {{so that it can}} be risk weighted.|$|E
25|$|Thus, one {{incentive}} for banks to create securitized assets {{is to remove}} risky assets from their balance sheet by having another institution assume the credit risk, so that they (the banks) receive cash in return. This allows banks to invest more of their capital in new loans or other assets and possibly have a lower <b>capital</b> <b>requirement.</b>|$|E
40|$|We study a {{mechanism}} inherent in risk-based <b>capital</b> <b>requirements,</b> which reduces procyclicality. By attenuating cross-subsidization effects, risk-based <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> improve the effi ciency of credit allocation by curbing the propensity for excessively risky investments. This {{leads to a}} reduction in investment failures and thus smaller output losses in recessions. Based on this mechanism, we derive optimal risk-based <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> and show that their properties are in line with policy initiatives: <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> should be lowered during recessions but their average level over time should be increased. The higher <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> could be partly replaced by socially less costly taxes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{evaluate}} Zimbabweâ€™s banking sector <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> based on existing theory and evidence. Literature surveyed {{is used to}} critically evaluate the existing design of bank <b>capital</b> <b>requirements.</b> The study shows that all banks in Zimbabwe had fallen short of minimum <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> in 2012, prompting aggressive capital raising strategies in the banking sector. In this study, various implications of the new <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> for the banking industry and the economy in general are discussed. The discussion supports the increase in <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> in that bank stability and lending would be enhanced {{as a result of}} such increase in capital. This however comes at a cost as the weighted average cost of funds increases due to the use of additional equity in capital structure of banks which further adversely impacts on borrowers. Overall, the study shows that benefits of increasing <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> outweigh the costs. Further, a set of recommendations for three economic sectors, namely, the banking institutions, the central bank and the government, on ways to respond to the regulatory changes and standard regulatory <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> are outlined...|$|R

2500|$|Because limited {{liability}} generally prevents shareholders, directors or employees being sued, the Companies Acts {{have sought to}} regulate the company's use of its capital in at least four ways. [...] "Capital" [...] refers to the economic value of a company's assets, such as money, buildings, or equipment. First, and most controversially, the Companies Act 2006 section 761, following the EU's Second Company Law Directive, requires that when a public company begins to trade it has a minimum of £50,000 promised to be paid up by the shareholders. After that, the capital can be spent. This is a largely irrelevant sum for almost any public company, and although the first Companies Acts required it, since 1862 {{there has been no}} similar provision for a private company. Nevertheless, a number of EU member states kept minimum capital rules for their private companies, until recently. In 1999, in Centros Ltd v Erhvervs- og Selskabsstyrelsen the European Court of Justice held that a Danish minimum capital rule for private companies was a disproportionate infringement of the right of establishment for businesses in the EU. A UK private limited company was refused registration by the Danish authorities, but it was held that the refusal was unlawful because the minimum capital rules did not proportionately achieve the aim of protecting creditors. Less restrictive means could achieve the same goal, such as allowing creditors to contract for guarantees. This led a large number of businesses in countries with minimum capital rules, like France and Germany, to begin incorporating as a UK [...] "Ltd". France abolished its minimum <b>capital</b> <b>requirement</b> for the SARL in 2003, and Germany created a form of GmbH without minimum capital in 2008. However, while the Second Company Law Directive is not amended, the rules remain in place for public companies.|$|E

30|$|Ten {{years after}} the worst {{financial}} crisis of the post-war period, Switzerland has established a Too-Big-To-Fail (TBTF) framework.

We estimate the social {{costs and benefits of}} higher <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> for the two large Swiss banks and derive socially optimal capital ratios from the cost-benefit trade-off.

40|$|Emerging market {{currency}} crises {{are often}} followed by banking crises. One {{reason for the}} transmission is the increased value of foreign debt measured in local currency. Equity capital is often insufficient to ensure liquidity. This problem is addressed by Basel II, in particular by its minimum <b>capital</b> <b>requirements.</b> In difference to the current regulation (Basel I), Basel II employs a differentiated risk weighing on base of credit ratings. This contribution calculates the hypothetic effects of the new regulation on minimum <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> for {{the example of the}} South Korea currency and banking crises of 1997. The results are compared to current regulation. It can be shown that minimum <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> in the case of Basel II would have been lower than in the case of Basel I. Additionally, minimum <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> would have increased dramatically. The transmission from currency to banking crises would not have been prevented, but would have been accelerated. Thereby, minimum <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> under Basel I have been relatively low because of South Korea’s OECD membership. It can therefore be concluded that in other emerging market economies, which are not OECD members, the ratio of minimum <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> of Basel II to the minimum <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> of Basel I prior the crises would have been even lower. Therefore, the new instrument of banking regulation would have intensified the transmission from currency to banking crises. ...|$|R

The long-run economic benefits of higher <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> are substantial for the Swiss economy leading to a significantly lower probability of banking crises and associated expected losses.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the questions that will need to be addressed in order to determine whether increased cyclicality in <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> will exacerbate the pro-cyclicality in the financial system. Many central banks have raised concerns about the potential cost of procyclicality that could come with the Basel II framework, which will be implemented in the EU via the <b>Capital</b> <b>Requirements</b> Directive (CRD). Previous capital adequacy rules required banks to hold a minimum amount of capital for each loan, regardless of the different risks involved. The main objective of the Basel II framework/CRD is to make <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> more risk-sensitive. Therefore, by construction, the <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> under the CRD will be more cyclical than under the previous rules. This raises two questions. First, does it matter whether regulatory <b>capital</b> <b>requirements</b> fluctuate more than before if banks 2 ̆ 019 (lending) behaviour is driven by other capital considerations (for example economic capital) ?
