40|$|This paper reviews {{trends in}} capital flows and capital-like flows such as {{official}} grants and remittances to low-income countries {{over the period}} 1981 - 2006. The survey reveals a broadbased increase in such flows {{as a share of}} low-income country GDP across major regions, countries with differing commodity export composition, and countries with differing debt relief status. The increase in inflows is dominated by an increase in private sector inflows, mostly in the form of private transfers and foreign direct investment. Official sector inflows have remained comparatively constant as a share of low-income country GDP and even declined in the most recent years. The paper concludes with some tentative policy conclusions and has a discussion of data issues in the annexes.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the causes, consequences, and potential cures {{of the large}} <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficits in the Southern Euro Area (SEA). These were mostly driven by a decline in private saving rates.

The paper finds that the deficits in SEA in 2008 were larger than {{can be explained by}} fundamentals, though the situation varies substantially across countries.

40|$|We {{identify}} {{global and}} regional fluctuations in international private debt flows to emerging {{and developing countries}} using data on cross border loans and international bond issuance over 1993 - 2009. We estimate the effects of individual borrower characteristics as well as macroeconomic conditions {{on the cost of}} foreign borrowing and test whether these effects differ across phases of the lending cycle. We find that public and financial institutions benefit from lower spreads compared to private and nonfinancial firms and that lenders may differentiate the risk associated with the borrower’s industrial sector between good and bad times. The loan (bond) rating has an equally robust spread reduction effect across credit cycle phases. The results also suggest that international reserve holdings and investment ratios {{have a significant effect on}} reducing credit spreads for loans, while higher reserve holdings and longer maturities matter more for bond spreads.

40|$|The Fourth Review Under the Extended Arrangement, Financing Assurances Review, and Request for Waiver of Performance Criteria for Serbia and Montenegro are discussed. The agreed tighter fiscal, monetary, and incomes {{policies}} should {{cool off}} wage and credit growth, which are driving {{the demand for}} imports. The bold resumption of structural reforms should over time help increase exports, which remain exceptionally low in reference to GDP. The fragile political situation could affect {{the ability of the}} reformist minority government to press ahead with bold reforms.

40|$|This study empirically {{analyzes}} {{the determinants of}} bond market development in {{a cross section of}} 23 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries between 1990 and 2008. It considers the stage of development {{and the size of the}} bond market, as well as the historical, structural, institutional and macroeconomic factors driving bond market development in SSA. The study finds that the savings constraint is a key impediment to domestic bond markets development as well as financial market deepening, as it results in a low level of financial intermediation by the banks. Overall, the results show that a confluence of factors matters for the development of domestic bond markets in SSA; these include structure of the economy, investment profile, law and order, size of the banking sector, the level of economic development, and various macroeconomic factors. Policy implications include increased efforts to strengthen the investment environment and the need for a regional approach to bond market development.

40|$|The paper investigates {{cyclical}} {{fluctuations in the}} current and financial (formerly capital) accounts of the balance of payments and major underlying components for nine industrial countries. The empirical model uses as explanatory variables domestic output growth, price inflation, real exchange rate fluctuations, energy price inflation, global growth, and regional growth. The evidence from the estimation of the model indicates the importance of fluctuations in output growth to the cyclicality of the <b>current</b> and financial <b>account</b> balances. The necessary and sufficient condition to sustain a large <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficit is high domestic growth, which tends to stimulate financial inflows and provides adequate resources for financing. Other factors appear to be less important to the cyclicality of the <b>current</b> and financial <b>account</b> balances and their negative correlations.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{empirical}} and theoretical link between increases in income inequality {{and increases in}} <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficits. Cross-sectional econometric evidence shows that higher top income shares, and also financial liberalization, which is a common policy response to increases in income inequality, are associated with substantially larger external deficits. To study this mechanism we develop a DSGE model that features workers whose income share declines {{at the expense of}} investors. Loans to workers from domestic and foreign investors support aggregate demand and result in <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficits. Financial liberalization helps workers smooth consumption, but at the cost of higher household debt and larger <b>current</b> <b>account</b> deficits. In emerging markets, workers cannot borrow from investors, who instead deploy their surplus funds abroad, leading to <b>current</b> <b>account</b> surpluses instead of deficits.

40|$|After {{widening}} {{substantially in}} the period preceding the global financial crisis, <b>current</b> <b>account</b> imbalances across the world have contracted to a significant extent. This paper analyzes the factors underlying this process of external adjustment. It finds that countries whose pre-crisis <b>current</b> <b>account</b> balances were in excess {{of what could be}} explained by economic fundamentals have experienced the largest contractions in their external balance. External adjustment in deficit countries was achieved primarily through demand compression, rather than expenditure switching. Changes in other investment flows were the main channel of financial account adjustment, with official external assistance and ECB liquidity cushioning the exit of private capital flows for some countries.
