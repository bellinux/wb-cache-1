5|$|However, {{it is not}} {{yet clear}} whether the {{citizenship}} rights in articles 18 and 21 TFEU are partly available to them as British Citizens, given the limited restriction of their rights under article 2 of the Protocol. That restriction on the exercise of certain freedoms does not apply to all Community or Union rights. The freedom of movement under the prior EC régime was and remains a separate set of rights from the <b>Citizen</b> <b>rights</b> under article 20 and 21 TFEU which include the right to move and reside. Those rights are primary citizenship rights, not a mere freedom. It might not need a Treaty change to perfect this, merely a preliminary ruling from the CJEU, and supplementary implementation measures from the Council, given the effective right of entrance and residence granted to EU nationals via Article 4 of the Protocol. Jersey residents presently do not have a right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. Jersey and Guernsey jointly opened an office in Brussels in 2010 to promote their common interests with European Union institutions.|$|E

Instead, he instituted progressive laws of his own, showing native Tunisian {{authority in the}} modernizing project and hence the redundancy of importing any Ottoman reforms. The Slave trade was abolished in 1841, slavery in 1846. Yet these legal reforms had limited application to many Tunisians. Ahmad Bey continued the general Beylical policy, i.e., to decline or reject political attachment to the Ottoman state, but welcome religious ties to the Ottoman Caliphate.|$|E

Accordingly, Ahmad Bey repeatedly refused to apply in Tunisia the Ottoman Tanzimat legal reforms concerning <b>citizen</b> <b>rights,</b> i.e., those of the Hatt-i Sherif of 1839. Instead, he instituted progressive laws of his own, showing native Tunisian authority in the modernizing project and hence the redundancy of importing any of the Ottoman reforms.

25|$|The {{right of}} abode in Hong Kong {{is the right to}} legally reside in Hong Kong without any limit or {{condition}} of stay being imposed by the Hong Kong Immigration Department. As the People's Republic of China stood to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom, the nationality of Hong Kong people as well as their {{right of abode}} in the territory was formalised prior to the 1997 handover. Since Hong Kong has never been an independent country, there is no provision for its own citizenship status. Hong Kong Permanent Resident is the legal status for those who have the right of abode in Hong Kong, which is the de-facto citizenship status in Hong Kong. Most <b>citizen</b> <b>rights</b> in Hong Kong (such as the right to vote) are granted to all permanent residents, while some (such as the right to hold a HKSAR passport, or becoming a high-rank public officer such as the Chief Executive) are restricted to permanent residents who are also Chinese citizens.|$|E

2500|$|In the 18th century, in the Dutch Republic, {{there was}} no {{national}} civil law which united the whole population. [...] Each town had its own civil law stipulating <b>citizen</b> <b>rights</b> and obligations, based on the citizenship model of the Roman Republic.

2500|$|The Constitutional Convention {{created a}} new, {{unprecedented}} {{form of government}} by reallocating powers of government. Every previous national authority had been either a centralized government, or a [...] "confederation of sovereign constituent states." [...] The American power-sharing was unique at the time. The sources and changes of power were up to the states. The foundations of government and extent of power came from both national and state sources. But the new government would have a national operation. To meet their goals of cementing the Union and securing <b>citizen</b> <b>rights,</b> Framers allocated power among executive, senate, house and judiciary of the central government. But each state government in their variety continued exercising powers in their own sphere.|$|E
2500|$|Beveridge was {{a member}} of the Eugenics Society, which {{promoted}} the study of methods to 'improve' the human race by controlling reproduction. In 1909, he proposed that men who could not work should be supported by the state [...] "but with complete and permanent loss of all <b>citizen</b> <b>rights</b> – including not only the franchise but civil freedom and fatherhood." [...] Whilst director of the London School of Economics, Beveridge attempted to create a Department of Social Biology. Though never fully established, Lancelot Hogben, a fierce anti-eugenicist, was named its chair. Former LSE director John Ashworth speculated that discord between those in favour and those against the serious study of eugenics led to Beveridge's departure from the school in 1937.|$|E

Many blacks felt betrayed by the Republicans due to the bill's slow process to the Senate.

2500|$|In {{light of}} the {{repeated}} abuses by ex post facto laws passed by the state legislatures, 1783–1787, the Constitution prohibited ex post facto laws and bills of attainder to protect United States citizen property rights and right to a fair trial. Congressional power of the purse was protected by forbidding taxes or restraint on interstate commerce and foreign trade. States could make no law [...] "impairing the obligation of contracts." [...] To check future state abuses the framers searched {{for a way to}} review and veto state laws harming the national welfare or <b>citizen</b> <b>rights.</b> They rejected proposals for Congressional veto of state laws and gave the Supreme Court appellate case jurisdiction over state law because the Constitution is the supreme law of the land. The United States had such a geographical extent that it could only be safely governed using a combination of republics. Federal judicial districts would follow those state lines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lack of a}} universally {{recognized}} world {{body can}} put the initiative upon global citizens themselves to create rights and obligations. Rights and obligations as they arose at the formation of nation-states (e.g. {{the right to vote}} and obligation to serve in time of war) are being expanded. Thus, new concepts that accord certain [...] "human rights" [...] which arose in the 20th century are increasingly being universalized across nations and governments. This is the result of many factors, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations in 1948, the aftermath of World War II and the Holocaust and growing sentiments towards legitimizing marginalized peoples (e.g., pre-industrialized peoples found in the jungles of Brazil and Borneo). Couple this with growing awareness of our impact on the environment, and there is the rising feeling that <b>citizen</b> <b>rights</b> may extend to include the right to dignity and self-determination. If national citizenship does not foster these new rights, then global citizenship may seem more accessible.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1862, President Lincoln {{met with}} African-American leaders and {{urged them to}} colonize some place in Central America. Lincoln planned to free the Southern slaves in the Emancipation Proclamation and he was {{concerned}} that freedmen would not be well treated in the United States by whites in both the North and South. Although Lincoln gave assurances that the United States government would support and protect any colonies, the leaders declined the offer of colonization. Many free blacks had been opposed to colonization plans {{in the past and}} wanted to remain in the United States. President Lincoln persisted in his colonization plan believing that emancipation and colonization were part of the same program. Lincoln was successful by April 1863 at sending black colonists to Haiti and 453 to Chiriqui in Central America; however, none of the colonies was able to remain self-sufficient. Frederick Douglass, a prominent 19th-century American civil rights activist, criticized that Lincoln was [...] "showing all his inconsistencies, his pride of race and blood, his contempt for Negroes and his canting hypocrisy." [...] African Americans, according to Douglass, wanted <b>citizen</b> <b>rights</b> rather than to be colonized. Historians debate if Lincoln gave up on African-American colonization at the end of 1863 or if he actually planned to continue this policy up until 1865.|$|E
2500|$|The foedus {{served as}} the basic {{template}} for Rome's settlement with the large array of tribes and city-states of the whole Italian peninsula that it subjugated during the period 338–264 BC. At {{the start of this}} period, the original Latins were mostly granted Roman citizenship. But the terms of the foedus was extended to about 150 other tribes and city-states. When a state was defeated, a part of its territory would be annexed by Rome to provide land for Roman/Latin colonists. The latter, although Roman citizens, were required to give up their <b>citizen</b> <b>rights</b> on joining a colony, and accept the status of socii. This was in order that Latin colonies could act as [...] "watchdogs" [...] on the other socii in the allied military formations, the alae. The defeated state would be allowed to keep the rest of its territory in return for binding itself to Rome with a perpetual treaty of military alliance. This would require the ally to [...] "have the same friends and enemies as Rome", effectively prohibiting war against other socii and surrendering foreign policy to Rome. Beyond this, the central, and in most cases sole, obligation on the ally to contribute to the confederate army, on demand, a number of fully equipped troops up to a specified maximum each year, to serve under Roman command.|$|E
