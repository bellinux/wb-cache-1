5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1969, W.L. Nolen, a twenty-year-old inmate at Soledad prison who had been convicted in 1963 for robbery, began {{circulating}} a petition to file {{a lawsuit against the}} prison's superintendent, Cletus J. Fitzharris, charging that guards and officials at the facility knew of [...] "existing social and racial conflicts" [...] and that they had been seeking to excite them through [...] "direct harassment and in ways not actionable in court", including the filing of false disciplinary reports and intentionally leaving black inmates' <b>cells</b> <b>unlocked</b> to put them in danger of assault.|$|R
5000|$|The {{morning of}} the riot began as an {{ordinary}} day would, with <b>cells</b> <b>unlocked</b> at 7:00 am. There was a [...] "scuffle" [...] between a prisoner and guards over the time taken to leave his cell - resulting in that prisoner being sent to solitary confinement - {{but that was not}} particularly unusual. Later that morning the prisoner was released into the exercise yard, where he reported to his fellow prisoners that he had been beaten by the prison officers. Prisoners then requested a meeting with the Superintendent; this was denied, but a request for medical examination was granted.|$|R

50|$|Despite being {{known as}} the most secure federal prison in the system, two inmates were able {{independently}} to kill their accompanying guards. Relatively lax security procedures allowed a prisoner, while walking down a hall, {{to turn to the}} side and approach a particular cell. The prisoner in that <b>cell</b> subsequently <b>unlocked</b> Silverstein's handcuffs with a stolen key and provided him with a knife.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePlasma cell {{differentiation}} is a tightly regulated process that requires appropriate T cell helps {{to reach the}} induction threshold. To further understand mechanisms by which T cell inputs regulate B cell fate decision, we investigate the minimal IL- 2 stimulation for triggering human plasma {{cell differentiation}} in vitro. Here we show that the timed repression of BACH 2 through IL- 2 -mediated ERK/ELK 1 signalling pathway directs plasma cell lineage commitment. Enforced BACH 2 repression in activated B <b>cells</b> <b>unlocks</b> the plasma <b>cell</b> transcriptional program and induces their differentiation into immunoglobulin M-secreting cells. RNA-seq and ChIP-seq results further identify BACH 2 target genes involved in this process. An active regulatory region within the BACH 2 super-enhancer, under ELK 1 control and differentially regulated upon B-cell activation and cellular divisions, helps integrate IL- 2 signal. Our study thus provides insights into the temporal regulation of BACH 2 and its targets for controlling the differentiation of human naive B cells...|$|R
50|$|Dartmoor was reopened in 1851 as a {{civilian}} prison, but was closed again in 1917, when it was converted into a Home Office Work Centre for certain conscientious objectors granted release from prison; <b>cells</b> were <b>unlocked,</b> inmates wore their own clothes, and could visit the village in their off-duty time. It was reopened as a prison in 1920, and then contained some of Britain's most serious offenders.|$|R

60|$|Bear with me {{a moment}} {{and look at the}} problem. Here were {{thirteen}} beasts of us over half a thousand other beasts. It was a living hell, that prison, and it was up to us thirteen there to rule. It was impossible, considering the nature of the beasts, for us to rule by kindness. We ruled by fear. Of course, behind us, backing us up, were the guards. In extremity we called upon them for help; but it would bother them if we called upon them too often, in which event we could depend upon it that they would get more efficient trusties to take our places. But we did not call upon them often, except in a quiet sort of way, when we wanted a <b>cell</b> <b>unlocked</b> in order to get at a refractory prisoner inside. In such cases all the guard did was to unlock the door and walk away {{so as not to be}} a witness of what happened when half a dozen hall-men went inside and did a bit of man-handling.|$|R

50|$|At {{approximately}} 10:20 PM, Officers Joe Burton and Phillip Pence {{arrived to}} perform the search and found Zuern lying naked in his bunk. Officer Pence ordered Zuern {{to get to his}} feet; he then stood {{at the door of the}} <b>cell.</b> Pence <b>unlocked</b> the <b>cell</b> and told Zuern to come out and put his hands against the wall. Zuern lunged at Pence and fatally stabbed him in the chest with the metal shank. The weapon was a long dagger-like piece of metal, approximately seven inches long. One end was sharpened to a point, and the other end was curved into a loop.|$|R
50|$|Slopping out is {{the manual}} {{emptying}} of human waste when prison <b>cells</b> are <b>unlocked</b> in the morning. Inmates without a flush toilet in the cell have to use other means (formerly a chamber pot, then a bucket, now often a chemical toilet) while locked in during the night. The reason that some cells do not have toilets is that they date from the Victorian era and were therefore not designed with plumbing. As a result, there is no space in which to put a toilet, together with the expense and difficulty of installing the necessary pipes.|$|R
60|$|Early {{next morning}} our <b>cells</b> were <b>unlocked,</b> {{and down in}} the hall the several hundred prisoners of us formed the lock-step and marched out into the prison-yard to go to work. The Erie Canal runs right by the back yard of the Erie County Penitentiary. Our task was to unload canal-boats, {{carrying}} huge stay-bolts on our shoulders, like railroad ties, into the prison. As I worked I sized up the situation and studied the chances for a get-away. There wasn't the ghost of a show. Along the tops of the walls marched guards armed with repeating rifles, and I was told, furthermore, that there were machine-guns in the sentry-towers.|$|R

50|$|Aina, Ranty, and Joshua were {{nominated}} by the housemates on Day 36. However, in a twist called Insta Save, Big Brother {{gave them a}} chance to remove themselves from the list of nominees.

To reach the key, they need to use only the items inside each of their <b>cells.</b> Whoever <b>unlocks</b> them first will be instantly removed from the list of nominees. They were also given the chance to ask for help to the other housemates; Aina picked Alex, Joshua picked Loisa, and Ranty picked Jane. Ranty was the first to get the key, but he did not open his cell and gave way to Joshua to gain the Insta Save. Joshua was then removed from the list of nominees.|$|R

Daryl makes his way outside the courtyard, only to be caught by Saviors, who anticipated his escape. Surrounded, Daryl is approached by Negan, who orchestrated the escape as a test to see if Daryl can prove himself to him. After giving Daryl options, Negan swings Lucille at him, stopping just short of hitting him; Daryl doesn't flinch. Negan admires Daryl's reaction. Feeling disrespected by Daryl for not quivering, Negan tells him that he is lucky that Lucille isn't thirsty. Negan leaves; Daryl is beaten up by the circle of Saviors.|$|R

[...] You eventually did escape, early in the morning of January 14: one news report claimed the improvised lock to his cell door had been picked {{with the aid of a}} confederate. [...] You hid in the environs of South Bend for several days, during which he was hunted by a squad led by sheriff Thomas A. Roney. [...] On January 15 he was sighted by two men; the following day the county commissioners met and agreed to offer a reward of $200 for You's capture.
