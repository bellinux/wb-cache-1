50|$|The {{combined}} {{solution was}} scheduled to be direct current, but the offshore converter turned out to be prohibitively expensive, and alternating current (AC) was chosen instead. Like the 150 kV cables connecting the ″EnBW Baltic 2″, ″Baltic 1″ and Germany, the cables connecting Krigers Flak to ″Baltic 2″ and to Denmark will be relatively short and thus using AC which is more economical. However, Germany is part of the synchronous grid of Continental Europe, while Kriegers Flak will connect to eastern Denmark, which is synchronized with the Nordic grid. As such, the non-synchronous connection requires a paired, back-to-back HVDC <b>converter</b> <b>substation,</b> to be located in Bentwisch, Germany, which already hosts the <b>converter</b> <b>substation</b> for the Kontek interconnector. The transmission capacity will be 400 MW, with the <b>converter</b> <b>substation</b> being delivered by ABB for around 140M US$. Thus, when Kriegers Flak operates at its full 600 MW capacity at least one third of the produced power must be transmitted to Denmark.|$|E

By establishing the calculation models of electric field strength along the tube bus surface and the electric field strength on ground, the paper computes the corona onset voltage gradient and gives the relation curve of high and electrode spacing of tube bus. If the tube bus in HVDC <b>converter</b> <b>substation</b> is installed at the high and electrode spacing, got by the relation curve, it will not generate corona and its electric field strength will meet the requirements.

40|$|Today most utility scale PV {{power plants}} {{have a system}} voltage of 1000 V and <b>converter</b> <b>substations</b> with around 1 MWp power.

In {{order to reduce the}} cost, it seems promising to increase the DC voltage level of the plant and the maximum power of the <b>converter</b> <b>substations</b> which decreases the total cable length and the number of <b>converter</b> <b>substations</b> in the plant. In this work the cost of different PV power plant layouts at high DC voltage levels were determined. Four different concepts were worked out, firstly a 1000 VDC (state of the art), secondly a 1500 VDC (state of the art with increased voltage), thirdly a topology for a 2 -stage concept with fixed voltage link and fourthly a bipolar PV-Generator. The most significant conclusion from this study was the 30 % lower Balance of system (BOS) costs and subsequent savings in Levelized Cost of Electricity achieved from the power plant concepts with higher system voltage compared to the state of the art. With continuous fall in module and inverter prices, the BOS cost cut will be of greater significance in the near future. Further an analysis of potentail savings in PV system oriented in the East West compared to regular South facing plants was made.

40|$|The {{offshore}} wind resource around the seas of the UK {{is a very}} large renewable energy resource. Future {{offshore wind}} farm sites leased by the Crown Estate for Round 3 development will need high power capacity grid connection, but their remote location presents a challenge for the electrical connection to the grid. Long distance AC cable transmission is not practical due to the large cable capacitance which leads to reactive power loss. This thesis considers the voltage source converter and high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) technology as the future grid connection for the offshore wind farm network, which is more controllable and has better transmission efficiencies for long distance and high power cable transmission applications. The offshore AC network is weak with very little inertia and has limited rating at the HVDC <b>converter</b> <b>substation.</b> The dynamics in key variables in the offshore wind farm AC network and how they affect certain components in the system were studied. Without proper control, the offshore voltage and the frequency will be sensitive to change. The capacitor of the AC filter at the offshore VSC-HVDC station was found to be vulnerable to over-voltage, therefore a closed loop AC voltage controller was proposed here to maintain a constant capacitor voltage and to prevent tripping or over-voltage damage. The tuning of the control gains were optimised with a pole placement design method and small signal analysis for observing the system eigenvalue damping. The control parameters were then tuned for a fast and well damped controller. The AC voltage controller was evaluated and compared to an open loop system. The controller was able to limit the resonance in the LC filter that can be triggered by large and fast disturbances in the current, voltage and frequency. Current saturation could be implemented within the control structure for device protection from over-currents. Insight on how the wind turbine fully rated frequency converters and controllers may interact with the VSC-HVDC converter station is also discussed...|$|E

5000|$|... 1.5% [...] of {{the energy}} {{transmitted}} on the British AC Supergrid is lost (transformer, heating and capacitive losses), of which a little under two-thirds, or 1% on the British supergrid, represents [...] "DC", resistive, heating type losses. With the use of superconductors, the capacitive and transformer losses, {{in the unlikely event}} the transmission lines were still overhead, AC lines, would remain the same. Overhead lines do not lend themselves at all well physically to the incorporation of cryogenic hydrogen piping, due to the likely weight of the transmission medium and the considerable brittleness of supercooled materials. It would probably be necessary for a supercooled hydrogen-carrying transmission line to be subterranean, and this in turn means that for such a cable, if it were of any distance (e.g. over 60 km), the power would have to be converted to DC and transmitted as such, since otherwise the capacitive losses would be too high. The power electronic losses in the AC/DC <b>converter</b> <b>substations</b> to convert the AC power {{at either end of the}} cryogenic cable to and from DC, if the transmission line(s) itself were DC, would also remain exactly the same as they would have been without the use of a superconducting transmission line - but the DC type resistive losses in the transmission lines would be rendered even smaller than at present.|$|R

By 1949, many of the Liberty Bell Limiteds were running almost empty. Service quality declined during the 1950s as the LVT lost rider revenue to pay expenses, {{which led to a}} further loss of riders. Through service to Philadelphia on the P&W ended in 1949. When the LVT cars stopped running directly to the Philadelphia 69th Street terminal and terminated at Norristown, passengers were required to transfer to Philadelphia and Western cars, travel convenience diminished. The company had become marginal regarding profitability and a bleak future lay ahead. Expenses of maintaining arail line were high. Along with rolling stock and track, LVT had to maintain AC to DC power conversion rotary <b>converters</b> <b>substations</b> along its line to generate 600 Volt DC trolley power from locally provided AC power. In 1951, it had an aging car fleet, had to pay all costs to maintain roadbed, track, drainage systems, stations, other buildings, trolley catenary, bridges, and snow removal. And it paid local property taxes. Revenues were not keeping up with expenses and the company faced bankruptcy. Management had been petioning the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission to abandon rail operations, and finally September 1951, they were given permission for a [...] "trial" [...] suspension with a conversion to buses. With no notice to the public, the formerly once an hour white and red interurban trolley cars simply didn't show up the next day. Operation was converted to buses on back roads, which dissatisfied both employees and riders. Management quickly sent crews out to rip up rails, remove signals, and take down trolley wire, the idea being to prevent being ordered back to interurban operation. Cars were sent to the nearby Bethlehem Steel plant for scrapping. The shutdown of the Liberty Bell Limited caused considerable loss of employment at the shops at Allentown and Souderton.

5000|$|Long Island City Power Station in Hunter's Point, NY {{was built}} by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1906 in {{preparation}} for the North River Tunnels and the opening of Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. The station consisted of 64 coal-fired boilers and three steam turbine generators with a total capacity of 16 MW. In 1910, the station was expanded with two additional turbine generators for a total capacity of 32.5 MW. Power was transmitted to rotary converters (AC to DC machines) for use in the PRR's original third rail electrification scheme. Like most DC electric distribution systems of the time (Thomas Edison's being the most famous), 25 Hz power was used to drive rotary <b>converters</b> at <b>substations</b> along the line. Some sources state that the station was largely dormant by the 1920s. When AC overhead electrification was extended in the 1930s, Long Island City connected to the 11 kV catenary distribution system. Operation of the station was transferred to Consolidated Edison in 1938, although ConEd began supplying power from the adjacent Waterside Generating Station, most likely due to declining overall demand for 25 Hz power. The station was disused and sold in the mid-1950s.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a Multi-Stage Network Processor {{as part of}} independentsupervisory control in HVDC grid connecting AC areas. The proposed Network Processor finds the topology of the grid building the AdjacencyMatrix, identifies islands and assigns DC slack bus. The approach consists of twolevels: 1) process of DC substation topology locally and 2) the secondary process atHVDC grid central supervisory controller. At the substation level, the Local Processor determines the branch/bus model of thesubstation including the possible standalone HVDC converters using breakers’ status. Substation Matrix holds information regarding {{the model of the}} part of substationconnected to DC grid, while Standing Alone Matrix is created when the <b>converter</b> inthe <b>substation</b> is not connected to DC grid.

40|$|The {{advanced}} {{traction power}} supply system (ATPSS) is a new directional development for traction {{power supply system}}s, which can totally remove the neutral sections and effectively promote power quality.

In this paper, a new configuration based on a three-level neutral point clamped (3 L-NPC) three-phase to single-phase cascade <b>converter</b> in a <b>substation</b> is proposed for ATPSS, {{which can be used}} to match the capacity of the converter for high voltage and large power applications.

Then, the inductance equalizing circuit is applied for the voltage balance on the DC-link. Besides, a LC filter circuit is designed to eliminate the double line-frequency ripple of DC voltage. Afterwards, a simulation model and an experimental prototype are developed, respectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to compare a {{two-level}} and a multilevel <b>converter</b> for HVDC <b>substation.</b> For this study, both topologies were designed with different modulation strategies and compared {{on the basis of}} size, power losses and impact on power quality. The model of a basic substation was built in MATLAB, and a 450 MVA converter was modeled for different topologies and modulation techniques. Further, the total losses of the converter were computed using different voltage/current ratings of the modules in order to derive a performance comparison. In addition to the evaluation of losses, the impact on the power quality was also analyzed for the multilevel converters. The results of the thesis revealed that, if harmonic emission without the need of external filters is the main criteria then, a twenty-three level converter with a modular structure could be used. The value of the output current THD in case of the twenty-three level converter is 0. 52 % which is well within the power quality standards and excludes the use of filters. The losses for a three level modular converter were found to be lower than the two-level converter (0. 59 % versus 1. 14 %). Also, the use of a 4. 5 kV module presented the lowest losses compared to other module ratings (2. 5 kV- 6. 5 kV), for all converter topologies...|$|R
40|$|Citation: Graham, Lewis M. Elder, Leonard Roscoe. The use of {{the rotary}} <b>converter</b> in <b>substations.</b> Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1906. Introduction: In street or {{interurban}} railway service, when {{the distance from the}} central station becomes greater than five or six miles, the copper losses over the trolley become excessive, and it is necessary to reduce these losses to a minimum. This is done by generating alternating current at from 2000 to 7000 volts, or if a higher voltage is desired a step up transformer is used. This high potential is transmitted to a substation situated at some convenient place on the line. Here the line voltage is stepped down by a transformer to something below 1100 and converted into direct current. This conversion may be made by one of three ways. (1). The alternating current may be fed into a synchronous or induction motor which is belted or direct connected to a direct current generator. (2). A motor-generator may be used. This is a machine with two separate armature windings on the same core, one being connected to slip rings through which alternating current is fed and operates the machine as a synchronous motor, driving the other winding as a direct current generator connected to a commutator. (3). The alternating current may be fed into a rotary converter, direct current being taken off at the other end. It is about this machine that I wish to write. The rotary converter as far as purpose is concerned is simply the commutator of a direct current rotating at some distance from the generator. But with it as with any commutator it must rotate at the same cyclic speed as the generator. To accomplish this the principle of the synchronous motor is used, for the synchronous motor will run at synchronous speed if it runs at all. So the rotary converter is essentially a synchronous motor in the respect that it has a magnetic field in which rotates an armature winding connected slip rings by leads which are taped on at regular intervals, there being as many rings as there are phases in the circuit...|$|R
