50|$|Propoxur (Baygon) is a <b>carbamate</b> <b>insecticide</b> and was {{introduced}} in 1959.

50|$|The {{so-called}} <b>carbamate</b> <b>insecticides</b> {{feature the}} carbamate ester functional group. Included {{in this group}} are aldicarb (Temik), carbofuran (Furadan), carbaryl (Sevin), ethienocarb, fenobucarb, oxamyl, and methomyl. These insecticides kill insects by reversibly inactivating the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The organophosphate pesticides also inhibit this enzyme, although irreversibly, and cause a more severe form of cholinergic poisoning.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbamate</b> <b>insecticides</b> {{are slowly}} {{reversible}} inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. They resemble acetylcholine, but the carbamoylated enzyme undergoes the final hydrolysis step very slowly (minutes) {{compared with the}} acetylated enzyme generated by acetylcholine (microseconds).

40|$|The {{first case}} of {{poisoning}} {{of a dog}} with Furadan 35 -ST in Serbia is described. The active ingredient of Furadan 35 -ST is carbofuran (2, 3 -dihydro- 2, 2 -dimethyl- 7 - benzofuranyl methyl <b>carbamate),</b> a <b>carbamate</b> <b>insecticide,</b> acaricide and nematocide. This highly poisonous substance is classified by the World Health Organisation into Class 1 b and in Serbia into Group 1 of The List of Poisons. Pathological assessment revealed hyperaemia and degenerative and necrotic changes in the liver, kidneys and heart. In addition, lysis of the nuclei in the motor neurons, loss of tigroid substance and pericellular oedema in the ventral horns of the spinal cord, and acute pancreatitis were found. In addition to the non-specific changes (hyperaemia, degenerative and necrotic changes in the parenchymal organs), {{the ones in the}} ventral horns of the spinal cord and acute pancreatitis may lead to carbamate poisoning being suspected.

50|$|A {{number of}} {{compounds}} {{have been discovered}} which are potent inhibitors of JH esterase. Many of these are insecticides falling into two major structural groups, the phosphoamidothiolates and S-phenylphosphates; <b>carbamate</b> <b>insecticides</b> were also tested. By far the most potent inhibitor was an ethoxythiophenylphospamidothiolate, with IC50 < 1 nM. Of particular interest {{in this study is}} that ethyl and isopropyl analogs of natural JHs were NOT cleaved by the esterase, showing that it is methyl ester specific. JH I and JH III were tested at nominal concentrations of 5 µM. Later a trifluoromethyl ketone (3-octylthio-1,1,1-trifluoro-2-propanone) was shown to be a highly potent, high affinity slow, tight binding inhibitor of the JH esterase of Trichoplusia ni, the same Lepidopteran which was used in the other study in this section.

40|$|We have {{identified}} two mutations in the ace 1 gene of Aphis gossypii {{that are associated}} with insensitivity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to <b>carbamate</b> and organophosphate <b>insecticides.</b> The first of these, S 431 F (equivalent to F 331 in Torpedo californica), is associated with insensitivity to the <b>carbamate</b> <b>insecticide</b> pirimicarb in a range of A. gossypii clones. The S 431 F mutation is also found in the peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), and a rapid RFLP diagnostic allows the identification of individuals of both aphid species with a resistant genotype. This diagnostic further revealed the presence of S 431 in several other pirimicarb-susceptible aphid species. The serine at this position in the wild-type enzyme has only been reported for aphids and provides a molecular explanation of why pirimicarb has a specific aphicidal action.

In three consecutive days prior to the treatment (hours – 48, – 24 and 0) and 1, 3, 5, 7, 24 and 48 hours thereafter, the clinical status was registered to evaluate rectal body temperature, faeces excretion, locomotion, perception etn. and were obtained blood samples from v. subcutanea ulnaris or v. metatarsea ulnaris for analysis of haemoglobin content (HGB).
