5|$|Bulgarian cuisine {{is similar}} to those of other Balkan {{countries}} and demonstrates a strong Turkish and Greek influence. Yogurt, lukanka, banitsa, shopska salad, lyutenitsa and kozunak are among the best-known local foods. Oriental dishes such as moussaka, gyuvech, and baklava are also present. Meat <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> lower than the European average, given a notable preference for a large variety of salads.|$|E
5|$|Studies in {{the early}} 2000s found that other dietary factors are not relevant. Specifically, {{moderate}} consumption of purine-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, lentils and spinach) are not associated with gout. Neither is total consumption of protein. Alcohol <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> strongly {{associated with an increased}} risk, with wine presenting somewhat less of a risk than beer and spirits.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{commercial}} use of Se, accounting for about 50% of <b>consumption,</b> <b>is</b> {{for the production}} of glass. Se compounds confer a red color to glass. This color cancels out the green or yellow tints that arise from iron impurities typical for most glass. For this purpose, various selenite and selenate salts are added. For other applications, a red color may be desired, produced by mixtures of CdSe and CdS.|$|E
50|$|Total {{electricity}} <b>consumption</b> <b>was</b> 91 TWh in 2008. Finland {{had about}} same consumption 87 TWh with {{only half of}} Belgium’s population. In 2009 <b>consumption</b> <b>was</b> 8,152 kWh per person.|$|R

But there are few reports of energy consumption about the Chinese campus at present. This article is aimed at Jilin Architectural and Civil Engineering Institute, and the situation of various energy sources <b>consumption</b> <b>was</b> investigated by field survey and questionnaires. The annual total water <b>consumption</b> <b>was</b> 525181 m 3, the total coal <b>consumption</b> <b>was</b> 13263 t, the electricity was 4376220 kwh and the total natural gas was 238278 m 3. The largest water <b>consumption</b> <b>was</b> in September (59647 m 3 /M) and the smallest was in January (27763 m 3 /M). The largest coal <b>consumption</b> <b>was</b> in December, January and February (2700 t/M), and the smallest <b>consumption</b> <b>was</b> from May to September (123 t/M); The smallest electricity <b>consumption</b> <b>was</b> in August (205740 kWh/M) and the largest was in December (584660 kWh/M). The largest natural gas <b>consumption</b> <b>was</b> in December (20920 m 3 /M) and the smallest was in August (17638. 86 m 3 /M). Using the investigation results, we can obtain the overall trend of energy consumption of the university and provide important data basis to guide rebuild and extend construction of school in the future...|$|R
5|$|This fungus is inedible, as it {{contains}} the toxic compound gyromitrin, which when digested is metabolized into monomethylhydrazine, {{a major component}} of rocket fuel. Although much of the gyromitrin may be removed by parboiling with generous volumes of water, <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> not advisable due to possible long-term health effects—there is evidence that even small doses of gyromitrin may have a cumulative carcinogenic effect.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of genetic engineering, a whole new type of food has been brought into the world, and {{scholars}} in both academia and Judaic faith have differing viewpoints on whether these new strains of foods are to be considered kosher or not. The first genetically modified animal approved by the FDA for human <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> the AquAdvantage salmon, and while salmon is normally an acceptably kosher food, this modified organism has a gene from a nonkosher organism.|$|E
5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E

5|$|Another example, is the Junta Administradora del Acueducto La Sirena en el Valle del Cauca (Water Board La Sirena) in {{the southwestern}} {{outskirts}} of Cali, which manages 778 residential connections, offering continuous service to some 4,200 users. It operates a sewerage system and a wastewater treatment plant. Water <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> metered. The average monthly tariff is US$3.5 for 28m3. There is no social stratification, but special tariffs are applied to those users who consume more than 28m3. The annual cash surplus is about US$10,000 which is reinvested in preventive maintenance {{and in some cases}} in construction works. In this way, in the last 3years a water capture facility was constructed in Quebrada Epaminondas, another one at Melendez River was improved, and a water tank with a capacity of 220m3 was constructed.|$|E
5|$|As of 2000, {{the median}} intake of iodine from {{food in the}} United States was 240 to 300μg/day for men and 190 to 210μg/day for women. The general US {{population}} has adequate iodine nutrition, with {{women of childbearing age}} and pregnant women having a possible mild risk of deficiency. In Japan, consumption was considered much higher, ranging between 5,280μg/day to 13,800μg/day from dietary seaweed or kombu kelp, often in the form of Kombu Umami extracts for soup stock and potato chips. However, new studies suggest that Japan's <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> closer to 1,000–3,000μg/day. The adult UL in Japan was last revised to 3,000µg/day in 2015.|$|E
5|$|As {{with similar}} {{substances}} with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from alcohol dependence {{can be fatal}} {{if it is not}} properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor, promoting central nervous system depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in tolerance and physical dependence. When alcohol <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life-threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure. Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{mandatory}} veterinary controls in slaughterhouses, large trichinellosis outbreaks due to horse meat <b>consumption</b> <b>are</b> rare, but cases in hunters {{and their families}} after raw or rare wild boar meat <b>consumption</b> <b>are</b> regularly reported, with over 100 cases since 1975.|$|R
2500|$|The six {{tanks in}} the {{fuselage}} and wings held approximately 5,000 litres of fuel {{with an additional}} 1,500 litres in an external drop tank.

5|$|Copenhagen aims to be carbon-neutral by 2025. Commercial and {{residential}} buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy {{features such as}} solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. District heating will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste incineration and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20–30% of cars will run on electricity or biofuel by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.|$|E
5|$|Horse meat {{has been}} used as food for humans and {{carnivorous}} animals throughout the ages. It is eaten {{in many parts of the}} world, though <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> taboo in some cultures, and a subject of political controversy in others. Horsehide leather {{has been used}} for boots, gloves, jackets, baseballs, and baseball gloves. Horse hooves can also be used to produce animal glue. Horse bones can be used to make implements. Specifically, in Italian cuisine, the horse tibia is sharpened into a probe called a spinto, which is used to test the readiness of a (pig) ham as it cures. In Asia, the saba is a horsehide vessel used in the production of kumis.|$|E
5|$|Levodopa and {{proteins}} use {{the same}} transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access. When they are taken together, {{this results in a}} reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive protein <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> discouraged and well balanced Mediterranean diet is recommended. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing protein intake in the evening.|$|E

5|$|Probably {{the easiest}} to recycle would be bismuth-containing fusible alloys {{in the form of}} larger objects, then larger {{soldered}} objects. Half of the world's solder <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> in electronics (i.e., circuit boards).
