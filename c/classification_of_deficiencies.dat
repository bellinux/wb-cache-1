40|$|Adequate <b>classifications</b> <b>of</b> {{disorders}} are {{of paramount importance}} {{in the management of}} congenital bleeding disorders. <b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> congenital FVII <b>deficiency</b> should be simple, based on few tests using thromboplastins of different origin. The first thromboplastin to be used is a rabbit brain preparation since it has been proven that this is the one that, overall, yields the lowest activity level. This is particularly so since molecular biology techniques have supplied important information with regard to the structure–function relation but have failed to supply a satisfactory <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> the defect. Mutations in the same domain have yielded different forms <b>of</b> FVII <b>deficiency.</b> Furthermore, molecular biology techniques are time consuming and are not feasible in every laboratory. A <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> FVII <b>deficiency</b> based on clinical, clotting, and immunological assays is proposed.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW Here {{we review}} recent {{developments}} concerning the diagnosis, <b>classification</b> and treatment <b>of</b> factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency and new findings {{related to the}} pathogenesis of the disease. RECENT FINDINGS Most recently, the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Scientific and Standardization Committee published a guideline for the diagnosis and <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> FXIII <b>deficiencies.</b> Since 2009, three novel mutations causing severe bleeding diathesis were discovered in the FXIII-A gene {{and one in the}} FXIII-B gene. A newly described FXIII-A <b>deficiency</b> was <b>of</b> the extremely rare qualitative type II deficiency. The first well established founder effect was reported for a causative FXIII-A mutation. More than a quarter <b>of</b> all FXIII-A <b>deficiencies</b> are due to autoantibody, among them the first case <b>of</b> <b>deficiency</b> caused by anti-FXIII-B autoantibody was reported in the last 2 years. The safety and effectiveness of plasma FXIII concentrate for prophylaxis and treatment is now well established. The new recombinant FXIII product is currently in phase III clinical trial and the preliminary data are promising. SUMMARY FXIII deficiency is considered the most underdiagnosed bleeding diathesis. The recommended algorithm for its diagnosis and classification could improve the diagnostic efficiency. The preferred choice for substitution therapy is FXIII concentrate (plasma-derived or, in the future, recombinant) ...|$|R

However, compared with XLP caused by SLAM-Associated Protein deficiency (SH 2 D 1 A mutation), XIAP deficiency was originally observed {{to be associated}} with a high incidence of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and a lack of lymphoma, suggesting that <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> XIAP <b>deficiency</b> as a cause of XLP may not be entirely accurate. To further characterize XIAP deficiency, we reviewed our experience with 10 patients from 8 unrelated families with BIRC 4 mutations. Nine of 10 patients developed HLH by 8 years of age. Most patients presented in infancy, and recurrent HLH was common. There were no cases of lymphoma. Lymphocyte defects thought to contribute to HLH development in SLAM-Associated Protein deficiency were not observed in XIAP deficiency. We conclude that XIAP deficiency is a unique primary immunodeficiency that is more appropriately classified as X-linked familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis...|$|R

COACH is an innovative algorithm designed for building an online handwriting evaluation tool {{to be used for}} classifying and remediating handwriting deficiencies. COACH adapts learning and data mining techniques from AI to handwriting deficiency classification in an innovative fashion. Until now handwriting classification has been performed manually by trained therapists causing expensive and subjective evaluation. This application lowers the cost of evaluation, increases objectiveness, and enables repeated testing that can accompany therapy. COACH is evaluated on real data obtained from children with poor handwriting using a digitizer tablet. Results show that COACH manages to successfully differentiate between poor to proficient handwriting. Differentiation is obtained even after using data from only a few words. These results prove that COACH is a promising emerging application for online evaluation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe conserved {{oligomeric}} Golgi (COG) {{complex is}} a tethering factor composed of eight subunits that {{is involved in}} the retrograde transport of intra-Golgi components. Deficient biosynthesis of COG subunits leads to alterations of protein trafficking along the secretory pathway and thereby to severe diseases in humans. Since the COG complex affects the localization of several Golgi glycosyltransferase enzymes, COG deficiency also leads to defective protein glycosylation, thereby explaining the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> COG <b>deficiencies</b> as forms <b>of</b> congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG). To date, mutations in COG 1, COG 4, COG 7 and COG 8 genes have been associated with diseases, which range from severe multi-organ disorders to moderate forms of neurological impairment. In the present study, we describe a new type <b>of</b> COG <b>deficiency</b> related to a splicing mutation in the COG 5 gene. Sequence analysis in the patient identified a homozygous intronic substitution (c. 1669 - 15 T>C) leading to exon skipping and severely reduced expression of the COG 5 protein. This defect was associated with a mild psychomotor retardation with delayed motor and language development. Analysis of different serum glycoproteins revealed a CDG phenotype with typical undersialylation of N- and O-glycans. Retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum trafficking was markedly delayed in the patient's fibroblast upon brefeldin-A treatment, which is a hallmark <b>of</b> COG <b>deficiency.</b> This trafficking delay could be restored to normal values by expressing a wildtype COG 5 cDNA in the patient cells. This case demonstrates that COG deficiency and thereby CDG must be taken into consideration even in children presenting mild neurological impairments...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> common {{symptoms}} {{and the laws}} of syndrome element combination in 251 cases of stable angina pectoris (SAP) by using cluster analysis and corresponding-correlation analysis. Methods: A total of 251 SAP cases were selected and their information from four diagnosis in traditional Chinese medicine was recorded. The <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> common symptom {{and the laws of}} syndrome element combination were investigated by cluster analysis and corresponding-correlation analysis. Results: Twenty-five symptoms found in 251 SAP cases were divided into four types by cluster analysis: <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> heart qi, <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> spleen qi, <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> qi and yin, and phlegm accumulation and blood stasis.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of a 14 -year-old girl with a new homoallelic mutation in the sepiapterin reductase (SR) gene is reported. Initially she presented {{at the age of}} 2 with hypotonia and mild cognitive developmental delay, and was diagnosed as having mild methylmalonic aciduria, which was recently identified as methylmalonylCoA racemase deficiency, a new defect in valine-isoleucine metabolism. After a 12 -year progression of her neurologic condition, which had made her wheelchair-bound at the age of 6, dystonia with diurnal variation had become apparent. At the age of 14 this finding led to rapid diagnosis <b>of</b> SR <b>deficiency.</b> The diagnostic approach with CSF neurotransmitter and pterins analysis and combined phenylalanine/BH(4) loading test, and finally measurement of sepiapterin in CSF is illustrative for the diagnosis <b>of</b> SR <b>deficiency.</b> As in all other patients with this new defect, very low levels of homovanillic acid and 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid and high levels of biopterin and sepiapterin in the CSF are the diagnostic hallmark. The girl improved dramatically on treatment with L-DOPA and 5 -hydroxytryptophan. The initial {{diagnosis of}} methylmalonic aciduria may afterwards be considered to have not significantly contributed to her clinical condition and only has led to a long delay of the clinically relevant diagnosis <b>of</b> SR <b>deficiency.</b> Although the clinical condition of this recently recognized autosomal recessive defect in pterin metabolism is complex and many symptoms can occur in variable severity and time of onset, dystonia with diurnal variation is a characteristic finding, as shown in nearly all patients described so far. The rapid and favourable response on treatment with L-DOPA warrants the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> SR <b>deficiency</b> as another autosomal recessive type of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD). This classification is important to improve the awareness of clinicians that more than one metabolic defect can underlie the phenotype of a DOPA-responsive dystonic disorder and that dystonia should always trigger a rapid diagnosis of the underlying neurotransmitter synthesis defect, in view of the excellent treatability of a DR...|$|R
40|$|Background: Because {{there is}} limited {{information}} concerning the vascular pattern {{and the role of}} vessels in patients with proximal femoral focal deficiency, the vascular supply of the lower extremities was studied systematically with use of computed tomographic angiography in order to identify vascular changes, relate any vascular changes to the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>deficiency,</b> and establish that there are no major changes in the topographical anatomy of the vessels. Methods: Standardized computed tomographic techniques were used in twenty-one patients (thirteen boys and eight girls who ranged from one to nineteen years old) with proximal femoral focal deficiency types I through IV and VII, VIII, and IX, according to the Pappas classification. Results: A common anatomical vascular pattern, in which the hypoplastic extremity was supplied through the femoral artery, was detected in nineteen patients. In patients with Pappas type-I through IV disease, the external iliac, femoral, and deep femoral arteries were substantially reduced in length and diameter and the deep femoral artery arose more proximally in comparison with that in the contralateral extremity; however, in the patients with Pappas type-VII, VIII, or IX disease, the diameters of the arteries and the origin of the deep femoral artery were {{similar to those of the}} contralateral extremity.

40|$|INTRODUCTION. According to WHO 3. 6 {{billion of}} people on the planet have latent iron {{deficiency}} and another 1. 8 billion of people suffer from iron deficiency anemia (IDA). According to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine information the prevalence and the incidence <b>of</b> iron <b>deficiency</b> anemia is 1163. 9 and 404. 5 per 100 000 persons, respectively. However, this information is only clinically confirmed cases of IDA. The largest share in the structure of morbidity has the latent iron deficiency, which is characterized by less prominent clinical manifestations. Treatment of IDA aimed not only at addressing anemia as a symptom, but also at the elimination <b>of</b> iron <b>deficiency</b> and replenishment <b>of</b> its reserves in the organism, which can be achieved by taking ferric drugs. Today ferric drugs market is characterized by high leveled competition, stable demand and a wide range of products. Therefore, an important issue {{in the study of the}} market is to find the best ways to determining its potential capacity to expand the marketing potential and to provide iron supplementation as many consumers who need treatment and prevention <b>of</b> iron <b>deficiency.</b> GOAL <b>OF</b> THE STUDY. the segmentation of the population that needs treatment and prevention <b>of</b> iron <b>deficiency</b> on the basis of the etiological factors that cause development of anemia, based on official statistics on morbidity.

40|$|Factor X (FX) plays {{a pivotal}} role in blood coagulation. FX {{represents}} the point where all coagulation systems converge and, once activated, it converts prothrombin into thrombin. The discovery and definition of FX are based on the description between 1956 and 1957 about three patients and their families with a peculiar defect later demonstrated to be almost identical. These patients were an American (Mr. Stuart), a British (Ms. Prower), and a Swiss with Italian background (infant Delia B). We stated "almost identical" because immunological and molecular biology studies subsequently revealed that even though the basic clotting defect was identical, the FX protein level and the mutation were different in each case. Mr. Stuart had no FX protein in his plasma and the mutation was Val 298 Met (homozygote). Ms. Prower instead had a normal level of FX protein and the mutation was Arg 287 Trp[*]+[*]Asp 282 Asn (compound heterozygote). Unfortunately, the status of the Swiss patient in this regard is not known. Subsequent studies described a few major variants (FX Friuli, FX Melbourne, FX Padua, and other similar patients), which showed peculiar activation patterns (FX Friuli had a normal Russell viper venom clotting time; FX Melbourne was defective only in the intrinsic coagulation system; FX Padua, on the contrary, was defective only in the extrinsic coagulation system). All these studies have informed on the great heterogeneity and complexity of the FX defect. The story of the discovery and <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> FX <b>deficiency</b> has contributed considerably to our understanding of blood coagulation.

40|$|In biotin-responsive {{multiple}} carboxylase deficiency, {{a characteristic}} organic aciduria reflects in vivo <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> mitochondrial propionyl CoA carboxylase, 3 -methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase, and pyruvate carboxylase. A possible primary or secondary defect in biotin absorption {{leads to an}} infantile-onset syndrome, while abnormal holocarboxylase synthetase activity has been identified in the neonatal-onset form. While distinct mitochondrial and cytosolic holocarboxylase synthetase biotinylation systems may exist in avian tissues, the system has not been characterized in humans. Toward this objective, we studied the biotin dependence of a cytosolic carboxylase, acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), in cultured skin fibroblasts of both types <b>of</b> multiple carboxylase <b>deficiency.</b> ACC specific activities in control and infantile-onset cells were not distinguishable at all biotin concentrations: with decreasing biotin availability (+ avidin), there were only modest decrements in ACC activity in both these cell types. In contrast, there were pronounced declines of ACC activity in neonatal-onset (holocarboxylase synthetase-deficient) cells after growth in low biotin concentrations, and activity was undetectable in + avidin. ACC activity was rapidly restored with biotin repletion to biotin-starved holocarboxylase synthetase-deficient cells, and this restoration was largely independent of protein synthesis. The behavior of the cytosolic carboxylase, ACC, is in all these respects identical {{to that of the}} mitochondrial carboxylases, an observation consistent with the existence of similar biotinylation mechanisms in the two cell compartments. Further, the data support the notion that at least some components of the holocarboxylase synthetase system are shared by mitochondria and cytosol in humans, and are consistent with the suggestion that restoration of activity in biotin-depleted cells represents biotinylation of preexisting enzyme protein. The modest decrements in ACC activity in normal and infantile-onset cells {{may be related to the}} compromised epidermal integrity observed in that form <b>of</b> multiple carboxylase <b>deficiency.</b> Finally, ACC and mitochondrial carboxylase activities were compared in cells from mutants representing a spectrum of clinical severity. Cells from later-onset patients of intermediate clinical severity were ultimately classifiable as putative holocarboxylase synthetase-deficient cells on chemical criteria. Accurate etiologic classification cannot be based on clinical presentation alone, and biochemical studies should be performed on all patients. Accordingly, we propose a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> multiple carboxylase <b>deficiency</b> based on biochemical criteria...|$|R
