5|$|It {{had been}} also conjectured that the double bond between carbons 4 and 5 of the imidazolium ring backbone, which gave {{aromatic}} character to that system, {{was important for}} the carbene's stability. This conjecture was disproved in 1995 by Arduengo's group, who obtained a derivative of dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene, lacking the double bond. The thermodynamical stability in this <b>compound,</b> <b>and</b> the role of steric protection in preventing dimerisation, has been a topic of some dispute.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum reacts exothermically with {{hydrogen}} {{to produce}} the dihydride LaH2, a black, pyrophoric, brittle, conducting compound with the calcium fluoride structure. This is a non-stoichiometric <b>compound,</b> <b>and</b> further absorption of hydrogen is possible, with a concomitant loss of electrical conductivity, until the more salt-like LaH3 is reached. Like LaI2 and LaI, LaH2 is probably an electride compound.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to propose a {{possible}} mechanism for the butyrylcholinesterase activation by 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), 3, 3 -dimethylbutyl-N-n-butylcarbamate (1), and 2 -trimethylsilyl-ethyl-N-n-butylcarbamate (2). Kinetically, TNT, <b>and</b> <b>compounds</b> 1 <b>and</b> 2 were characterized as the nonessential activators of butyrylcholinesterase. TNT, <b>and</b> <b>compounds</b> 1 <b>and</b> 2 were hydrophobic <b>compounds</b> <b>and</b> were proposed to bind to the hydrophobic activator binding site, which was located outside the active site gorge of the enzyme. The conformational change from a normal active site gorge to a more accessible active site gorge of the enzyme was proposed after binding of TNT, <b>and</b> <b>compounds</b> 1 <b>and</b> 2 to the activator binding site of the enzyme. Therefore, TNT, <b>and</b> <b>compounds</b> 1 <b>and</b> 2 may act as the excess of butyrylcholine in the substrate activator for the butyrylcholinesterase catalyzed reactions...|$|R

5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} <b>compound</b> <b>and</b> an {{essential}} nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E
