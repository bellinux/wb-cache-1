50|$|Seismic {{tomography}} {{can resolve}} anisotropy, anelasticity, density, and bulk sound density. Variations in these parameters {{may be a}} result of thermal or chemical differences, which are attributed to processes such as mantle plumes, subducting slabs, and mineral phase changes. Larger scale features that can be imaged with tomography include the high velocities beneath <b>continental</b> <b>shields</b> and low velocities under ocean spreading centers.|$|R
40|$|Temperature, velocity, and {{viscosity}} profiles for coupled thermal {{and mechanical}} {{models of the}} upper mantle beneath <b>continental</b> <b>shields</b> and old ocean basins show that under the continents, both tectonic plates and the asthenosphere, are thicker than they are beneath the oceans. The minimum value of viscosity in the continental asthenosphere is about {{an order of magnitude}} larger than in the shear zone beneath oceans. The shear stress or drag underneath continental plates is also approximately an order of magnitude larger than the drag on oceanic plates. Effects of shear heating may account for flattening of ocean floor topography and heat flux in old ocean basins...|$|R
50|$|Most lithophile {{elements}} form {{very stable}} ions with an electron configuration of a noble gas (sometimes with additional f-electrons). The few that do not, such as silicon, phosphorus and boron, form extremely strong covalent bonds with oxygen - often involving pi bonding. Their strong affinity for oxygen causes lithophile elements to associate very strongly with silica, forming relatively low-density minerals that thus float to the crust. The more soluble minerals {{formed by the}} alkali metals tend to concentrate in seawater or extremely arid regions where they can crystallise. The less soluble lithophile elements are concentrated on ancient <b>continental</b> <b>shields</b> where all soluble minerals have been weathered.|$|R

40|$|Scalar {{magnetic}} anomaly data from MAGSAT, reduced to vertical polarization and long wavelength pass filtered free air gravity anomaly data of South America and the Caribbean are compared to major crustal features. The <b>continental</b> <b>shields</b> generally are more magnetic than adjacent basins, oceans and orogenic belts. In contrast, the major aulacogens {{are characterized by}} negative anomalies. Spherical earth magnetic modeling of the Amazon River and Takatu aulacogens in northeastern South America indicates a less magnetic crust associated with the aulacogens. Spherical earth modeling of both positive gravity and negative magnetic anomalies observed over the Mississippi Embayment indicate {{the presence of a}} nonmagnetic zone of high density material within the lower crust associated with the aulacogen. The MAGSAT scalar {{magnetic anomaly}} data and available free air gravity anomalies over Euro-Africa indicate several similar relationships...|$|R
50|$|The {{interpretation}} of these observations {{is complicated by}} the effects of seismic anisotropy, which may greatly reduce the actual scale of the velocity anomaly. However, because of the reductions in Q and electrical resistivity in the LVZ, it is generally interpreted as a zone {{in which there is a}} small degree of partial melting. For this to occur at the depths where the LVZ is observed, small amounts of water and/or carbon dioxide must be present to depress the melting point of the silicate minerals. Only 0.05 - 0.1 % water would be sufficient to cause the 1% of melting necessary to produce the observed changes in physical properties. The lack of LVZ beneath <b>continental</b> <b>shields</b> is explained by the much lower geothermal gradient, preventing any degree of partial melting.|$|R

40|$|Comparison of MAGSAT scalar {{magnetic}} anomaly {{data to the}} main tectonic provinces and boundaries of South America reveals a number of geologic correlations. South America is divisible into a broad platform of Precambrian shields and cratons separated by Phanerozoic basins, grabens and aulacogens to the east, the Phanerozoic Patagonian Platform to the south, and the Mesozoic to Cenozoic Andean Fold Belt and Caribbean Mountain System {{to the west and}} north. The <b>continental</b> <b>shields</b> are mainly more magnetic then continental basins and orogenic belts. Cratons, mainly covered by younger sedimentary rocks, are generally associated with magnetic gradients. Most of the anomalies associated with the Patagonian Platform are positive and have higher amplitudes eastward away from the Andean Fold Belt. The northern Andes are coincident with positive magnetic anomalies, whereas the central and southern Andes are associated mainly with negative anomalies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEstimate of mantle {{heat flow}} under <b>continental</b> <b>shields</b> are very low, {{indicating}} a strong insulating effect of continents on mantle heat loss. This effect is investigated {{with a simple}} approach: continents are introduced in an Earth cooling model as perfect thermal insulators. Continental growth rate has then a strong influence on mantle cooling. Various continental growth models are tested and are used to compute the mantle depletion in radioactive elements {{as a function of}} continental crust extraction. Results show that the thermal blanketing effect of continents strongly affects mantle cooling, and that mantle depletion {{must be taken into account}} in order not to overestimate mantle heat loss. In order to obtain correct oceanic heat flow for present time, continental growth must begin at least 3 Gy ago and steady‚Äêstate for continental area must be reached for at least 1. 5 Gy in our cooling model...|$|R
40|$|Attention {{is given}} to long linear {{features}} visible in SAR images of the surface of Venus. They are shallow graben a few kilometers across. Calculations show that dike emplacement can account for such features if {{the top of the}} dikes is a few kilometers {{below the surface of the}} planet. The dikes are often curved near their probable sources, and the magnitude of the regional stress field estimated from this curvature is about 3 MPa, or similar to that of earth. On both Venus and earth, dikes often form intersecting patterns. Two-dimensional calculations show that this behavior can occur only if the stress field changes with time. Transport of melt over distances as large as 2000 km in dikes whose width is 30 m or more occurs in some <b>continental</b> <b>shields</b> on earth and can also account for linear features on Venus that extend for comparable distances. Such transport is possible because the viscosity and thermal conductivity of both the melt and the wall rock are small...|$|R

30|$|According to our {{modelling}} results, {{a precise}} {{estimate of the}} lithosphere resistivity {{in the region of}} interest is crucial in order to obtain a trustworthy estimate of the actual electric field. In this study, we considered a model with a lithosphere of laterally uniform thickness and resistivity. While the chosen lithosphere thickness of 100 km agrees with the global average, it is well-known that lithosphere thickness is very variable on Earth and ranges from few km at mid-ocean ridges to several 100 km below old <b>continental</b> <b>shields.</b> The choice of a laterally uniform lithosphere is thus a limitation of our work; it was however necessary, since thickness and resistivity of the lithosphere are poorly resolved on a global scale. We want to stress in this context that the numerical solution discussed in this paper is fully 3 -D and thus can readily adopt models with a laterally variable lithosphere once reliable information about such variability is available.|$|R
40|$|Chromium ore {{deposits}} {{range in}} age from 3. 5 -billion year-old chromite in the Selukwe greenstone belt (Zimbabwe) to the ophiolite-hosted Miocene deposits of New Caledonia. They provide indications of the evolving earth's tectonic processes in oceanic and continental crust and mantle. Podiform orebodies are hosted in peridotites, mostly now regarded as the remains of ob-ducted ophiolite complexes. They imply ocean spreading at their sites of original crystalliza-tion, and plate convergence where subsequently reemplaced by thrusting. Known ophiolites with chromite deposits date at 800 Ma or younger. Chromite deposits in Archcan green-stones resemble the ophiolite ores in respect to their peridotitc host rocks, shapes, and in-tense deformation but are recognizably cumulate ores. They are hosted in large ultramafic-mafic sill-like complexes in simatic volcanic sequences, suggesting that the Early Archcan ocean crust may have been more ultramafic in composition than at present. Stratiform chromite deposits of the Bushveld type are hosted in layered mafic complexes within the stable <b>continental</b> <b>shields.</b> Those of economic grade date between about 2900 an...|$|R
40|$|The post-rift {{denudation}} {{history of}} high-elevation divergent continental margins {{is central to}} deciphering source-to-sink systems across such margins and to unraveling their topographic evolution. We performed 40 Ar- 39 Ar dating of supergene K-Mn oxides from supergene manganese ore deposits in order to constrain the age of in situ formed laterites on both the lowland and highland sides of the Western Ghats Escarpment of Peninsular India. Documentation of laterites as old as 53 Ma on the highland and 47 Ma {{at the foot of}} the escarpment shows that the escarpment stabilized before 47 Ma (possibly 60 Ma). The topographic setting of the dated weathering mantles also constrains denudation of the lowland and the highland since ca. 50 Ma to maximums of 5 m/m. y. and 15 m/m. y., respectively. Our results challenge denudation rates derived from apatite fission track thermochronology by documenting the topography and relief longevity of the southwest Indian margin and its hinterland. The results preclude large-magnitude uplift of Peninsular India after the Eocene, and more generally argue against late Neogene uplift and topographic rejuvenation of <b>continental</b> <b>shields...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{available}} {{experimental data}} and steady-state calculations {{make it difficult}} to explain the M discontinuity beneath both oceans and continents {{on the basis of the}} same phase change. The oceanic M discontinuity may be a chemical discontinuity between basalt and peridotite, and a similar chemical discontinuity may thus be expected beneath the continents. Since available experimental data place the basalt-eclogite phase change at about the same depth as the continental M discontinuity, intersections may exist between a zone of chemical discontinuity and a phase transition zone, the transition being either basalt-eclogite or feldspathic peridotite-garnet peridotite. Detection of the latter transition by seismic techniques may be difficult. The M discontinuity could therefore represent the basalt-eclogite phase change in some localities (e. g. mountain belts) and the chemical discontinuity in others (e. g. oceans and <b>continental</b> <b>shields).</b> Variations in the depth to the chemical discontinuity and in the positions of geoisotherms produce great flexibility in orogenetic models. Intersections between the two zones at depth could be reflected at the surface by major fault zones separating large structural blocks of different elevations...|$|R
40|$|The Lehmann {{discontinuity}} at 220 -km depth is {{an important}} global feature which occurs under both oceans and continents. It is a barrier to penetration by young lithosphere and marks the base of seismicity in regions of continent-continent collision. The strong lateral variation in upper mantle velocities occurs mainly above this depth. Continental roots extend no deeper than about 150 ‚Äì 200 km. The basalteclogite transformation and eclogite-harzburgite separation {{may be responsible for}} the geometry of intermediate depth earthquakes. Oceanic and continental geotherms converge above about 200 km and become less steep than the melting gradient at greater depth. This implies a low viscosity channel near 250 km. This would give a decoupling zone of maximum shear beneath <b>continental</b> <b>shields.</b> The Lehmann discontinuity may be the interface between two distinct geochemical reservoirs. The velocity jump, and the inferred density jump, at 220 km are consistent with an increase in garnet content. The mantle may be garnet lherzolite above and eclogite immediately below the Lehmann discontinuity. The transition region may be mainly eclogite and be the source region for oceanic tholeiites...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{anomalies}} of the South American continent {{are generally}} more positive and variable than the oceanic anomalies. There is better correlation between the magnetic anomalies and the major tectonic elements of the continents than between the anomalies and the main tectonic elements of the adjacent oceanic areas. Oceanic areas generally show no direct correlation to the magnetic anomalies. Precambrian <b>continental</b> <b>shields</b> are mainly more magnetic than continental basins and orogenic belts. Shields differ markedly from major aulacogens which are generally characterized by negative magnetic anomalies and positive gravity anomalies. The Andean orogenic belt shows rather poor correlation with the magnetic anomalies. The magnetic data exhibit instead prominent east-west trends, which although consistent with some tectonic features, {{may be related to}} processing noise derived from data reduction procedures to correct for external magnetic field effects. The pattern over the Andes is sufficiently distinct from the generally north trending magnetic anomalies occurring in the adjacent Pacific Ocean to separate effectively {{the leading edge of the}} South American Plate from the Nazea Plate.

40|$|The average surface age of {{a planet}} is a major {{indicator}} {{of the level of}} its geologic activity and thus of the dynamics of its interior. Radar images obtained by Venera 15 / 16 from the northern quarter of the Venus (lat 30 to 90 degs) reveal about 150 features that resemble impact craters, and they were so interpreted by Soviet investigators B. A. Ivanov, A. T. Basilevsky, and their colleagues. These features range in diameter from about 10 to 145 km. Their areal density is remarkably similar to the density of impact structures found on the American and European <b>continental</b> <b>shields.</b> The basic difference between the Soviet and American estimates of the average surface age of Venus's northern quarter is due to which crater-production rate is used for the Venusian environment. Cratering rates based on the lunar and terrestrial cratering records, as well as statistical calculations based on observed and predicted Venus-crossing asteroids and comets, have been used in both the Soviet and American calculations. The single largest uncertainty in estimating the actual cratering rates near Venus involves the shielding effect of the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Despite a {{geological}} history characterised by {{high temperature}} and pressure processes and organic carbon deprived crystalline bedrock, {{large amounts of}} hydrocarbons are found in deep groundwaters within Precambrian <b>continental</b> <b>shields.</b> In many sites, methane comprises more that 80 % of the dissolved gas phase reaching concentrations of tens of mmol l‚àí 1. In this study, we used isotopic methods to study the carbon isotope systematics and sources of crustal methane within the Fennoscandian Shield. The main study sites were the Outokumpu Deep Drill Hole and the Pyh√§salmi mine in Finland, both of which allow groundwater sampling down to 2. 5 km depth and have been previously studied for their groundwater chemistry and microbiology. We show that {{the differences in the}} amount and isotopic composition of methane are related to the availability of carbon sources as well as processes behind the incorporation of hydrogen and carbon via abiotic and biotic pathways into hydrocarbon molecules. Supported by previously reported occurrences and isotopic data of deep groundwater methane in lithologically different locations in Finland and Sweden, we show that methane formation is controlled by microbial methanogenesis and abiotic reactions, as well as lithology with the metasedimentary environments being the most favourable for methane occurrence. Rather than a thermogenic relic, crustal methane within the Fennoscandian Shield is more likely the result of low temperature formation from ancient organic compounds or their inorganic intermediates such as graphite. Such crustal gases are characterised by the lack of major amounts of C 2 + hydrocarbons and 13 C-rich methane. Further, microbiological and isotopic geochemical evidence suggest that microbial methane is more common at depths shallower than 1. 5 km...|$|R
