This necessitated the inclusion of AppleTalk, a simple networking implementation which used low-cost cabling and the same physical RS-422 serial port hardware.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we {{consider}} the allocation of costs in <b>connection</b> <b>networks.</b> Agents have <b>connection</b> demands in form of pairs of locations {{they want to have}} <b>connected.</b> <b>Connections</b> between locations are costly to build. The problem is to allocate costs of <b>networks</b> satisfying all <b>connection</b> demands. We use a few axioms to characterize allocation rules that truthfully implement cost minimizing <b>networks</b> satisfying all <b>connection</b> demands in a game where: (1) a central planner announces an allocation rule and a cost estimation rule; (2) every agent reports her own connection demand as well as all connection costs; (3) the central planner selects a cost minimizing <b>network</b> satisfying reported <b>connection</b> demands based on the estimated costs; and, (4) the planner allocates the true costs of the selected network. It turns out that an allocation rule satisfies the axioms if and only if relative cost shares are fixed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we study}} {{fault-tolerant}} routing in bijective <b>connection</b> <b>networks</b> with restricted faulty edges. First, we {{prove that the}} probability that all the incident edges of an arbitrary node become faulty in an n-dimensional bijective <b>connection</b> <b>network,</b> denoted by Xn, is extremely low when n becomes sufficient large. Then, we give an O(n) algorithm to find a fault-free path of length at most n+ 3 ⌈log 2 ∣F∣⌉+ 1 between any two different nodes in Xn if each node of Xn {{has at least one}} fault-free incident edge and the number of faulty edges is not more than 2 n− 3. In fact, we also for the first time provide an upper bound of the fault diameter of all the bijective <b>connection</b> <b>networks</b> with the restricted faulty edges. Since the family of BC networks contains hypercubes, crossed cubes, Möbius cubes, etc., all the results are appropriate for these cubes...|$|R

Although simple interest metrics were used, the <b>connection</b> <b>network</b> model showed stable performance in the experiment with field data.

40|$|The phase {{transition}} of spiral waves in networks of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons impelled by channel noise is examined {{in point of}} interest. All neurons in the networks are combined with little world associations, and the outcomes are contrasted and the case for normal networks, in which all neurons are totally combined with closest neighbor associations. A statistical variable is characterized to contemplate the aggregate conduct and {{phase transition}} of the spiral wave because of the channel noise and topology of the network. The impact of little world <b>connection</b> <b>networks</b> is depicted by neighborhood normal <b>networks</b> and long-go <b>connection</b> with certain probability p. The numerical results affirm that (1) a stable rotating spiral wave can be created and keep up powerful with low p, where {{the breakup of the}} spiral wave and turbulence result from expanding the probability p to a specific threshold; (2) suitable intensity of the advanced channel noise can build up a spiral wave among turbulent states in little world association networks of H-H neurons; and (3) regular <b>connection</b> <b>networks</b> are more hearty to channel noise than little world <b>connection</b> <b>networks.</b> A spiral wave in a little world network experiences insecurity all the more effectively as the membrane temperature is expanded to a specific high threshold...|$|R

40|$|Central brain <b>network</b> <b>connections</b> greatly {{contribute}} to overall network efficiency. Here we examined whether small vessel disease (SVD) related white matter alterations in central brain <b>network</b> <b>connections</b> {{have a greater}} impact on executive functioning than alterations in non-central brain <b>network</b> <b>connections.</b> Brain <b>networks</b> were reconstructed from diffusion-weighted MRI scans in 72 individuals (75 ± 8 years) with cognitive impairment and SVD on MRI. The centrality of white matter <b>connections</b> in the <b>network</b> was defined using graph theory. The association between the fractional anisotropy (FA) of central versus non-central connections, executive functioning, and markers of SVD was evaluated with linear regression and mediation analysis. Lower FA in central <b>network</b> <b>connections</b> was more strongly associated with impairment in executive functioning than FA in non-central <b>network</b> <b>connections</b> (r = 0. 41 vs. r = 0. 27; P 50 %– 10 % connections). Higher SVD burden was associated with lower FA in central as well as non-central <b>network</b> <b>connections.</b> However, only central network FA mediated the relationship between white matter hyperintensity volume and executive functioning [change in regression coefficient after mediation (95 % CI) : − 0. 15 (− 0. 35 to − 0. 02) ]. The mediation effect was not observed for FA alterations in non-central <b>network</b> <b>connections</b> [− 0. 03 (− 0. 19 to 0. 04) ]. These findings suggest that the centrality of <b>network</b> <b>connections,</b> and thus their contribution to global network efficiency, appears to be relevant for understanding the relationship between SVD and cognitive impairment.
