40|$|The {{strength}} of olivine at low temperatures and high stresses in Earth’s lithospheric mantle exerts a critical control on many geodynamic processes, including lithospheric flexure {{and the formation}} of plate boundaries. Unfortunately, laboratory-derived values of the {{strength of}} olivine at lithospheric conditions are highly variable and greatly disagree with those inferred from geophysical observations. Here we demonstrate via nanoindentation that the strength of olivine depends on the length-scale of deformation, with experiments on smaller volumes of material exhibiting larger yield stresses. This “size effect” resolves discrepancies among previous measurements of olivine strength using other techniques. It also corroborates the most recent flow law for olivine, which proposes a much weaker lithospheric mantle than previously estimated, thus bringing experimental measurements into closer alignment with geophysical constraints. Further implications include an increased difficulty of activating plasticity in <b>cold,</b> fine-grained <b>shear</b> zones, and an impact on the evolution of fault surface roughness due to the size-dependent deformation of nanometer- to micrometer-sized asperities...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation {{consists}} of introduction, four chapters, conclusions {{and a list}} of literature of 118 designations. Total dissertation size is 151 pages. It contains 23 tables, 5 figures, 45 graphs and 4 photographs. Actuality of the theme was substantiated, object and tasks of work were formulated, scientific novelty of obtained results and their practical significance were reported, tenets of defense were formulated and also publications of work results were enlisted. Review of scientific literature both on question of physical-mechanical features of metal surfaces and on question of interaction of conjugated surfaces during static contact and under shear conditions was implemented. Earlier known methods of use of surface coatings for metal joining were reported and short review of foundation hypothesis of metal joining during their combine plastic deformation was given. On base of analysis of existing "cold" methods of metal joining (cold welding, cold soldering, <b>cold</b> <b>shear</b> welding) a conclusion was drawn considering necessity of an experimental testing of use of soft metal coatings in combination with shear in order to join metal specimens - so called <b>cold</b> <b>shear</b> soldering. Both experiment equipment and experiment method was described. Optimal routing for strenght test of soldered joining was worked out. After testing the well-known methods of experiments on strenght of joining it was decided to characterize the strenght of joining through strenght on edge (under normal load which equal to zero) that is carried out in the same direction because in this case there were obtained more stable results. Deduction of nondiscrete-logical model of process of <b>cold</b> <b>shear</b> soldering was implemented. On NL-model basis main technological parameters of process was determined. Afterwards their preliminary optimization was fulfilled. As pre-optimization result there were obtained values of parameters which were used later for optimization process by Box-Wilson method. Influence of main technological parameters to the process of <b>cold</b> <b>shear</b> soldering was investigated. Optimization of process using method of many-factors experiment planning was accomplished and optimal mode <b>cold</b> <b>shear</b> soldering was refined. The largest strenght of specimens joining was observed for specimens which were treated with emery paper M 40. Time of specimens hold-up on air after their treatment till shear has no significant influence of result. Optimal parameters were obtained as follows: thickness of tin covering on copper - equal to 0. 130 mm, value of specimens shear relatively each other -equal to 7 mm. Value of mormal loading is limited with experiment conditions. For our conditions of experiment optimal value was declared equal to 2600 N and shear exertion equal to 8500 N. Comparative analysis of rating and experimental values of actual contact area was implemented. Dependence of value of actual contact area on the main technological parameters was investigated. Basic normality of interaction of being sheared relatively each other metal solids and basic normality of joining formation mechanism under condition of simultaneous affection on contacting specimens the normal load and tangential displacements was described. Work contains results that confirm expediency of further study of <b>cold</b> <b>shear</b> soldering process. Possibility of its practical application is substantiated. Set of advantages of <b>cold</b> <b>shear</b> soldering in comparison with the other methods of metal joining is shown.

40|$|Loren Eiseley 2 ̆ 7 s {{literary}} reputation today rests {{almost exclusively}} on the significance of his nonfiction nature essays, which deservedly stand as influential exemplars of creative nonfiction science and nature writing. However, in his early years as an undergraduate at the University of Nebraska, Eiseley had the reputation as an important and promising poet, and he published poetry {{in a range of}} literary journals. Most notably, his work appeared in the earliest editions of Prairie Schooner, whose editorial staff he joined in 1927, the year after it began publication. And, not limited to his own school 2 ̆ 7 s journal, he published in a variety of other venues, even in Harriet Monroe 2 ̆ 7 s prestigious Poetry magazine. As a young man, Eiseley was immersed in the lively poetry world of the 1920 S and 1930 S and poised to become an important voice in that world. In particular, he was an enthusiastic champion of Robinson Jeffer 2 ̆ 7 s controversial inhumanistic poetry. Eiseley admired Jeffers 2 ̆ 2 above all modern writers because of their common heritage - 2 ̆ 7 the poet and the scientist in one 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 (Christianson, Fox 191). Eiseley 2 ̆ 7 s education exemplified this mix of poet and scientist; he received dual bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s degrees in English and anthropology. But for a variety of reasons, English lost out, and Eiseley chose to pursue graduate studies in anthropology. In spite of the promising start to his career as a poet, his poetic publications diminished precipitously after he took his first teaching job in 1937 at the University of Kansas. By 1945 he had ceased altogether to publish poetry. Alas, he would seem to have become that all too familiar, pitiful spectacle, the promising poet nipped in blossoming bud by the <b>cold</b> <b>shears</b> of economic necessity. It seems likely that to have continued to publish poetry while simultaneously pursuing a career in science would have been not only a distraction but likely a hindrance to professional advancement, for who would take him seriously as a scientist ifhe were also publishing, of all things, poetry. And later, at the University of Pennsylvania during the 1950 S and 1960 s, even as his reputation as a popular writer of science and nature essays grew, he nevertheless continued to refrain from poetry - from publishing it, that is, but not, it would seem, from writing it. Ever the furtive fox, Eiseley had continued to scribble poems through these years among the data and scientific trivia accumulating in his notebooks, while outwardly conforming to the sober and responsible demeanor of a scientist, interchanging, as he says, 2 ̆ 2 an artifact for a poem or a poem for an artifact 2 ̆ 2 (Notes 11). In his later years, as his academic career drew to a close and being known as a publishing poet could no longer injure his professional reputation, Eiseley released in quick succession three volumes of poetry: Notes of an Alchemist in 1972, The Innocent Assassins in 1973, and Another Kind of Autumn, posthumously published in 1977. In general, Eiseley scholars have tended to overlook his poetry. At best, they have seen his youthful poetry as a formative apprenticeship, laying the foundation for his real work, the crafting of his nonfiction prose essays. That his prose essays are so often praised for their poetic qualities has not seemed to suggest that his poetry itself might deserve a closer look. Poetry scholars have likewise overlooked Eiseley 2 ̆ 7 s poetry. At the time of the publication of his poetry books in the mid- 1970 S, poetry criticism was ill-suited to assessing and appreciating Eiseley 2 ̆ 7 s poetic output. Neither the lingering New Criticism nor the emerging postmodern hermeneutics of skepticism had much sympathy for Eiseley 2 ̆ 7 s earnest engagement with serious questions regarding a world that lay very much outside the text...|$|R

The main purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of ethanol solutions as post-polymerization treatment on the properties of acrylic reline resins (Kooliner, Ufi Gel Hard and Probase <b>Cold)</b> : <b>shear</b> bond strength to the denture base resin and the surface free energy. Shear bond strength test was performed on specimens of reline resins attached to denture base resin, after submitted to water, 20 %, 50 % or 70 % ethanol solutions at 55 ºC for 10 minutes (n= 10). Controls were left untreated. After this test, the failure mode was assessed. Surface free energy was estimated by contact angles determination, performed by the Wilhelmy plaque technique, on specimens submitted to the treatment with ethanol solutions (n= 5). For all resins there were {{no statistically significant differences}} (p= 0. 378) in shear bond strength between groups. However, the Probase Cold showed higher values (p< 0. 001) than the others. All of the failures were adhesive. All resins showed differences of surface free energy between groups. For Kooliner the water group showed higher results in surface free energy and its polar component than control group (p< 0. 05). Considering Ufi Gel Hard, treatment with 70 % ethanol solution showed significant lower values in surface free energy and its polar component and higher values in the dispersive component. For Probase Cold specific differences of total surface free energy between groups were not followed by an alteration on their components equilibrium. Kooliner showed lower values (p< 0. 001) in surface free energy than the other resins. Ethanol solutions as post-polymerization treatment did not deteriorate the bond strength of acrylic reline resin studied. In general, changes in surface free energy were minimal and not considered clinically relevant...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Dynamic {{testing of}} statically pre-deformed {{specimens}} of Ti 6 Al 4 V {{shows that the}} total strain to failure increases {{with the level of}} pre-strain. Furthermore, interrupted and various other dynamic tests on Ti 6 AL 4 V show that the temperature rise prior to localization has only a minor influence on adiabatic shear band (ASB) formation. For all the tests, the calculated dynamic deformation energy until ASB formation is found to be relatively constant. This indicates that adiabatic shear banding is dependent almost solely on dynamic deformation processes, with quasi-static and thermal effects prior to localization being very marginal. We suggest the concept of a constant dynamic mechanical energy (toughness) as a quantitative criterion for ASB formation. Physically, this concept is related to the dynamic stored energy of <b>cold</b> work. Adiabatic <b>shear</b> failure is a well know failure mechanism that is uniquely experienced in dynamic loading situations [1, 2]. The homogeneous deformation tends to localize into a narrow band followed by catastrophic failure. Because of the typical short time scales involved, the phenomenon is considered to be adiabatic with large temperature increases, especially inside the band. Many materials fail by adiabatic shear banding, in an uncontrolled manner. A vast body of literature has been dedicated to the material aspects of adiabatic shear failure [1, 2]. A basic criterion has been proposed by Zener and Hollomon [3], stating that ASB is governed by the competition between strain hardening and therma...|$|R
40|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that aircraft noise needs to be further reduced, there is an equally important, on-going requirement to accurately predict the strengths of all the different aircraft noise sources, not only {{to ensure that a}} new aircraft is certifiable and can meet the ever more stringent local airport noise rules but also to prioritize and apply appropriate noise source reduction technologies at the design stage. As the bypass ratio of aircraft engines is increased – in order to reduce fuel consumption, emissions and jet mixing noise – the fan noise that radiates from the bypass exhaust nozzle is becoming one of the loudest engine sources, despite the large areas of acoustically absorptive treatment in the bypass duct. This paper addresses this ‘aft fan’ noise source, in particular the prediction of the propagation of fan noise through the bypass exhaust nozzle/jet exhaust flow and radiation out to the far-field observer. The proposed prediction method is equally applicable to fan tone and fan broadband noise (and also turbine and core noise) but here the method is validated with measured test data using simulated fan tones. The measured data had been previously acquired on two model scale turbofan engine exhausts with bypass and heated core flows typical of those found in a modern high bypass engine, but under static conditions (i. e. no flight simulation). The prediction method is based on frequency-domain solutions of the linearized Euler equations in conjunction with perfectly matched layer equations at the inlet and far-field boundaries using high-order finite differences. The discrete system of equations is inverted by the parallel sparse solver MUMPS. Far-field predictions are carried out by integrating Kirchhoff's formula in frequency domain. In addition to the acoustic modes excited and radiated, some non-acoustic waves within the <b>cold</b> stream-ambient <b>shear</b> layer are also captured by the computations at some flow and excitation frequencies. By extracting phase speed information from the near-field pressure solution, these non-acoustic waves are shown to be convective Kelvin–Helmholtz instability waves. Strouhal numbers computed along the shear layer, based on the local momentum thickness also confirm this in accordance with Michalke's instability criterion for incompressible round jets with a similar shear layer profile. Comparisons of the computed far-field results with the measured acoustic data reveal that, in general, the solver predicts the peak sound levels well when the farfield is dominated by the in-duct target mode (the target mode being the one specified to the in-duct mode generator). Calculations also show that the agreement can be considerably improved when the non-target modes are also included, despite their low in-duct levels. This {{is due to the fact}} that each duct mode has its own distinct directionality and a non-target low level mode may become dominant at angles where the higher-level target mode is directionally weak. The overall agreement between the computations and experiment strongly suggests that, at least for the range of mean flows and acoustic conditions considered, the physical aeroacoustic radiation processes are fully captured through the frequency-domain solutions to the linearized Euler equations and hence this could form the basis of a reliable aircraft noise prediction metho...|$|R

One management practice used to reduce lamb losses due to <b>cold</b> exposure is <b>shearing</b> pregnant ewes. Research has shown that lambs born to shorn ewes have enhanced brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and increased birth weights and survival rates. The first study was designed {{to determine the effects of}} late-gestation shearing on lamb birth weights and survival in West Texas conditions. Ramboillet ewes were either shorn or remained unshorn 20 -d prior to lambing. Male lambs from shorn ewes had 12 % lower survival rates at one day of age, whereas, survival rates of female lambs were not affected by shearing treatment. Lamb birth weights were not affected by shearing treatment. The results of this experiment indicate that prenatal shearing of ewes in West Texas conditions did not increase birth weights or improve survival of newborn lambs. Breedtype also affects cold tolerance. Brahman calves generate less heat from BAT when stimulated with norepinephrine than Angus calves. A second study was conducted that examined the effects of cold exposure on BAT composition and iodothyronine 5 '-deiodinase (5 'D) activity in Angus and Brahman calves. Calves were slaughtered as newborns, or after 48 -h exposure to either warm (20 ? C) or cold (4 ? C). Rectal temperatures were higher in Angus calves at 0 -h, but were similar to Brahman calves thereafter. Brahman calves had higher plasma T? and T? concentrations than Angus calves, but T? increased more due to cold exposure in Brahman calves. Plasma T? concentrations were higher in cold than warm calves. Brahman calves had less BAT lipid at birth and after cold exposure, but similar amounts after warm exposure. Ctytochrome c oxidase activity was not affected by breed, and was higher in cold than warm calves. BAT 5 'D was higher in Brahman calves at birth, but not after warm or cold treatment. BAT 5 'D-II activity was higher in Brahman calves, but was not affected by postnatal treatment.
