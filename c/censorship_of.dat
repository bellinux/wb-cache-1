5|$|Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy {{provides}} {{the reader with}} a history of <b>censorship</b> <b>of</b> artworks. The book argues that artists have been scapegoated by those advocating censorship, as a method of diverting debate away from the suppression of human rights. The author asserts that <b>censorship</b> <b>of</b> works deemed obscene {{has been used as a}} tactic throughout history to suppress women's rights. Heins describes for the reader the history of the 1873 Comstock laws. It's stated that,"such laws were put forth by United States Postal Inspection Service inspector Anthony Comstock, and after he helped influence passage of the legislation, they enabled the government to criminalize sending perceived immoral writings through the mail".|$|E

5|$|The Catholic Church {{attained}} increasing {{political influence}} in the 1930s, and used its influence to promote <b>censorship</b> <b>of</b> movies, and to discourage publication of birth control information.

5|$|The PTC {{has been}} {{frequently}} criticized for hypocrisy, slanted reporting and only criticizing shows that {{are aimed at}} adults.

5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors <b>censorship</b> <b>of</b> Christianity plus {{increased}} government spending and power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals side with the homosexual agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working. Liberals are often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by many American Christians. The liberal ideology has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the opposite of conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own.|$|E
5|$|David Darts {{discussed}} Not in Front of the Children in {{an article}} for Studies in Art Education, and wrote that queries over artistic value as balanced against a desire to protect attendees of educational institutions from perceived harm repeatedly came up over {{time in the history}} of censorship. He observed that the rationale for justifying <b>censorship</b> <b>of</b> artwork from children was based upon similar reasons dating back from Plato to contemporary times, namely anxiety that youth would become corrupted by viewing products deemed inappropriate.|$|E

5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, the ACLU {{continued}} its battle against <b>censorship</b> <b>of</b> art and literature. In 1948, the New York affiliate of the ACLU received mixed {{results from the}} Supreme Court, winning the appeal of Carl Jacob Kunz, who was convicted for speaking without a police permit, but losing the appeal of Irving Feiner who was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace, based on his oration denouncing president Truman and the American Legion. The ACLU lost the case of Joseph Beahharnais, who was arrested for group libel when he distributed literature impugning the character of African Americans.|$|E

During the 1960s he wrote five columns {{a week for the}} Daily Mail on any subject that he chose. After a disagreement with the proprietor of the paper over attempted <b>censorship</b> <b>of</b> his column in 1970, Levin moved to The Times where, with one break of just over a year in 1981–82, he remained as resident columnist until his retirement, covering a wide range of topics, both serious and comic.|$|E
5|$|Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy: A Guide to America's Censorship Wars is a non-fiction book by {{lawyer and}} civil libertarian Marjorie Heins {{that is about}} {{freedom of speech and}} the <b>censorship</b> <b>of</b> works of art in the early 1990s by the U.S. government. The book was {{published}} in 1993 by The New Press. Heins provides an overview of the history of censorship, including the 1873 Comstock laws, and then moves on to more topical case studies of attempts at suppression of free expression.|$|E

5|$|She {{coordinated the}} effort against the Communications Decency Act of 1996, {{which was the}} first attempt by the United States Congress to {{introduce}} a form of <b>censorship</b> <b>of</b> speech on the Internet. Krug strongly opposed the notion that libraries should censor the material that they provide to patrons. She supported laws and policies protecting the confidentiality of library use records. When the United States Department of Justice used the authority of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 to conduct searches of what once were confidential library databases, Krug raised a public outcry against this activity by the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{apartheid}} government greatly limited {{freedom of}} expression, through censorship, reduced economic freedom, and reduced mobility for black people. However, {{it did not}} have the resources to effectively enforce <b>censorship</b> <b>of</b> written and recorded material. The government established the Directorate of Publications in 1974 through the Publications Act, but this body only responded to complaints, and took decisions about banning material that was submitted to it. Less than one hundred pieces of music were formally banned by this body in the 1980s. Thus music and performance {{played an important role in}} propagating subversive messages.|$|E
5|$|The book {{argues that}} artists have been scapegoated by those advocating censorship, {{as a method}} of {{deflecting}} debate away from the suppression of human rights. The author asserts that <b>censorship</b> <b>of</b> works deemed obscene {{has been used as a}} tactic throughout history to suppress women's rights. Heins argues that even if the perceived negative impacts of pornography,hip hop music, and violent films were factually accurate (and she asserts they are not), the ends would not justify the means of degrading the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She emphasizes that education should be used to help guard against potentially dangerous notions, instead of censorship and suppression of dissent.|$|E

To effect a closer correlation <b>of</b> <b>censorship</b> activities, representatives <b>of</b> Great Britain, Canada, and the United States signed an agreement providing for the complete exchange of information among all concerned parties {{and the creation of}} a central clearinghouse of information within the headquarters of the Office <b>of</b> <b>Censorship.</b>|$|R
