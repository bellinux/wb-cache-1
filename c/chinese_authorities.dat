The investigation also concluded that the various other safety failings at the facility were contributing factors. The report went on to criticize safety standards all throughout the Chinese steel industry.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chinese</b> <b>authorities</b> {{reportedly}} maintain {{lists of}} high-profile overseas Falun Gong practitioners, {{and they use}} these blacklists to impose travel and visa restrictions on practitioners. Chen Yonglin, the defector from the Chinese consulate in Sydney, said in 2005 that approximately 800 Australian Falun Gong practitioners had been blacklisted (Chen claimed he sought to remove most of these names).|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{a popular}} protest flag, {{the leaders of}} the Umbrella Movement {{requested}} that participants of the movement not use the flag, as they intended to protest without intentionally provoking <b>Chinese</b> <b>authorities</b> or the Hong Kong Police Force. The flag has also been used outside of Hong Kong; in the United Kingdom, the blue ensign {{has been used as a}} symbol of protest to pressure the government of the United Kingdom to ensure the Sino-British Joint Declaration is fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|From {{its base}} in India, the Company {{had also been}} engaged in an {{increasingly}} profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the confiscation by the <b>Chinese</b> <b>authorities</b> at Canton of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War, and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong Island, at that time a minor settlement.|$|E

5|$|In early 2013, protestors went to {{the streets}} flying the old colonial flag {{demanding}} more democracy and resignation of Chief Executive Leung Chun Ying.

5|$|Mogadishu Stadium was {{constructed}} in 1978 during the Barre administration, {{with the assistance of}} Chinese engineers. The facility was mainly used for hosting sporting activities, such as the Somalia Cup and for football matches with teams from the Somalia League. Presidential addresses and political rallies, among other events, were also held there. In September 2013, the Somali federal government and its Chinese counterpart signed an official cooperation agreement in Mogadishu as part of a five-year national recovery plan in Somalia. The pact will see the <b>Chinese</b> <b>authorities</b> reconstruct several major infrastructural landmarks, including the Mogadishu Stadium.|$|E

50|$|Portuguese traders first {{settled in}} Macau in the 16th century. In 1557 Macau was rented to Portugal by the Chinese empire as a trading port.

5|$|The decision, while widely {{praised by}} foreign intellectuals and politicians, was {{attacked}} by the Chinese government and the state media. A number of countries, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, also denounced the award and what they regarded as interference in China's domestic affairs. Following the announcement, official censorship was applied within China—on the Internet, television, and in print media. The government strongly denounced the award, and summoned the Norwegian ambassador in Beijing to make a formal protest. The <b>Chinese</b> <b>authorities</b> arrested citizens who attempted to celebrate. Liu's wife was put under house-arrest before {{the decision of the}} Nobel Committee was announced.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} the {{earthquake}} were not widely publicized by <b>Chinese</b> <b>authorities</b> until about 18 years after its occurrence. In China's first decades of Communist rule, its policy was to not disclose natural disasters or accidents unless foreigners were injured. While the Chinese official press had not released a comprehensive report, Reuters and the Royal Hong Kong Observatory both released information soon after the disaster. At {{the time of the}} quake, the Xinhua News Agency briefly mentioned a smaller magnitude quake but did not provide information on damage or casualties.|$|E
5|$|Chen Guangcheng, a blind self-taught Weiquan lawyer, rose to {{prominence}} for defending victims of China's one-child policy. First implemented in 1979, the one-child policy mandates that couples may {{only have one}} child, though there are exceptions for some rural citizens, ethnic minorities, and couples who were themselves only children. Though Chinese laws condemn harsh enforcement measures, <b>Chinese</b> <b>authorities</b> and family planning staff {{have been accused of}} carrying out coercive, late-term forced abortions, sterilization, incarceration and torture to enforce the policy. In 2005, Chen Guangcheng filed a class action case against family planning officials in Linyi, Shandong, who were accused of subjecting thousands of women to sterilization or forced abortions.|$|E
40|$|China {{has made}} a series of {{cultural}} policies after 2000 {{as a result of the}} ever-increasing popularity of overseas cartoons in order to boost domestic cultural industrialization development. Therefore, revitalizing domestic cartoon industry has become national culture strategy. The dissertation, through real cases, analyses the decisionmaking process of The Central Committee of the Communist Party, State Council and the Ministry of Culture. It is found out that the cartoon policies are subject to the <b>Chinese</b> political <b>authority</b> mechanism and they are closely related to each other. The dissertation points out that the <b>Chinese</b> <b>authority</b> mechanism not only stabilizes the release of cartoon policy but also limits it...|$|R
25|$|In {{more recent}} times, {{religious}} education is highly restricted in Xinjiang, and the <b>Chinese</b> <b>authority</b> {{had sought to}} eradicate any religious school they considered illegal. Although Islamic private schools (Sino-Arabic schools (中阿學校)) have been supported and permitted by the Chinese government among Hui Muslim areas since the 1980s, this policy does not extend to schools in Xinjiang due to fear of separatism.|$|R

5|$|The Battle of Kowloon was a {{skirmish}} between British and Chinese vessels off the Kowloon Peninsula, China, on 4 September 1839. Located {{in present-day}} Hong Kong, Kowloon was then {{part of the}} Guangdong province. The skirmish was the first armed conflict of the First Opium War and occurred when British boats opened fire on Chinese war junks enforcing a food sales embargo on the British community. The embargo was ordered after a local Chinese man died in a drunken brawl with British sailors. The <b>Chinese</b> <b>authorities</b> did not consider the punishment meted out by British officials to be sufficient and as a result, suspended food supplies {{in an attempt to}} force the handover of the culprit. In response, the British summoned nearby warships to force the Chinese to lift the embargo.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had left}} Canton, Simão de Andrade landed at Xiamen and Ningbo, {{establishing}} settlements there. Simão continued to defy local Chinese laws at Ningbo, and when his men were cheated on a trade deal with a Chinese man in 1545, Simão sent a band of armed men into the town, pillaged it, and took local women and young girls as their captives. The outraged locals banded together and slaughtered the Portuguese under Simão. A similar episode occurred later when Coelho de Sousa seized {{the house of a}} wealthy foreign resident in Jinzhou of Fujian, which led authorities to cut off supplies to the Portuguese; the Portuguese then attacked and ransacked a nearby village for supplies, which prompted <b>Chinese</b> <b>authorities</b> to destroy thirteen of their ships while thirty Portuguese survivors of this settlement fled to the Portuguese settlement at Macau in 1549.|$|E
5|$|Empire of the Sun {{was filmed}} at Elstree Studios in the United Kingdom, and on {{location}} in Shanghai and Spain. The filmmakers searched across Asia {{in an attempt to}} find locations that resembled 1941 Shanghai. They entered negotiations with Shanghai Film Studios and China Film Co-Production Corporation in 1985. After a year of negotiations, permission was granted for a three-week shoot in early March 1987. It was the first American film shot in Shanghai since the 1940s. The <b>Chinese</b> <b>authorities</b> allowed the crew to alter signs to traditional Chinese characters, as well as closing down city blocks for filming. Over 5,000 local extras were used, some old enough to remember the Japanese occupation of Shanghai 40 years earlier. Members of the People's Liberation Army played Japanese soldiers. Other locations included Trebujena in Andalusia, Knutsford in Cheshire and Sunningdale in Berkshire. Lean often visited the set during the England shoot.|$|E
50|$|Parts of Macau {{were first}} loaned to the Portuguese by China as a trading centre in the 16th century, with the Portuguese {{required}} to administrate the city under <b>Chinese</b> <b>authority.</b> In 1851 and 1864, the Portuguese Empire occupied the two nearest offshore islands Taipa and Coloane respectively, and Macau officially became {{a colony of}} the Portuguese Empire in 1887. Macau was returned to China in 1999.|$|R

25|$|Agents of Western governments had {{infiltrated}} Tibet by the mid-1950s, a {{few years}} after Tibet was annexed by the People's Republic of China. British MI6 agent Sydney Wignall, in his recent autobiography, reveals that he and John Harrop travelled to Tibet together in 1955 posing as mountaineers. Captured by the <b>Chinese</b> <b>authority,</b> Wignell recalled that he was surprised to find two CIA agents were already under Chinese detention.|$|R
