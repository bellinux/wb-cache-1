60|$|You recover in {{some degree}} your stifled hopes of sublimity as you pass beyond the palace {{and take your}} choice of either curving slope to descend into the Forum. Then you see that the little stuccoed edifice is but a modern {{excrescence}} on the mighty cliff of a primitive construction, whose great squares of porous tufa, as they underlie each other, seem to resolve themselves back into the colossal cohesion of unhewn rock. There are prodigious strangenesses in the union of this airy and comparatively fresh- faced superstructure and these deep-plunging, hoary foundations; and few things in Rome are more entertaining to the eye than to measure the long plumb-line which drops from the inhabited windows of the palace, with their little over-peeping balconies, their muslin curtains and their bird-cages, down to the rugged <b>constructional</b> <b>work</b> of the Republic. In the Forum proper the sublime is eclipsed again, though the late extension of the excavations gives a chance for it.|$|E

Their theme of music and dance was also too narrow, and because Gold Rush spent only 10 minutes with the executives for a Q&A session, as opposed to Synergy's 45 minutes, Gold Rush failed to capitalize on what the executives wanted.

50|$|There is {{an opinion}} that {{a model for}} this chapel was one of French royal chapels. Unfortunately, during later {{capturing}} of Buchlov Castle by armies of Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus {{in the second half}} of the 15th century, the chapel was destroyed to the point that it was abandoned. It was replaced by two large rooms serving as store and depository. And although the castle was a permanent possession of a king until the 16th century, it was often given in pawn to aristocratic clans. Nobles of Cimburk owned it at the end of the 15th century. At that time a representative chivalric hall was built. In the year 1511 the castle was given to a private holder, and from the 16th to 18th century various Moravian clans changed its ownership. The most important were the nobles of Žerotín, Zástřizl and Petřvald. <b>Constructional</b> <b>work</b> continued in Renaissance style. Some parts of the castle were added in baroque style. However, in 1701, the Buchlovice Castle was finished and in 1751 the owners, the Berchtold noble family, occupied it for more than two centuries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Due to {{the rapid}} {{industrialization}} taking place globally, the problems generated are acute shortage of construction material and increasing in productivity of wastes. The production and consumption of plastic and {{the rate at which}} solid plastic waste (SPW) are created have increased considerably. Plastics constitute 12. 3 % of total waste produced most of which is from discarded water bottles. The present research studies concentrate on resolving the above issues in a beneficial way. By the usage of PET bottle waste at suitable scale as concrete reinforcement for <b>constructional</b> <b>works,</b> the present research aims at waste management, by use of PET waste in improvement of concrete. The non-biodegradable PET bottle waste is used as reinforcement for concrete and the flexural strength of hardened concrete at 28 days was tested and compared with conventional concrete and steel reinforced concrete.

Fauna norvegica 26 / 27 : 3 - 14. The distribution of Margaritifera margaritifera (Linnaeus) in Norway is mainly {{along the coast}} and in the lowland. Based on a questionnaire sent to county governors’ offices and municipal administrations in Norway, about 430 former and existing localities have been recorded, of which about 300 are still-existing. However, the real number is probably {{more than twice as}} large. Central Norway has the highest number of documented sites. The northernmost locality is at Berlevåg (Finnmark) at 70 ° 50 ’N lat., and the highest verified record is near Snåsa (Central Norway) at 472 m a. s. l. The great majority of localities are associated with Cambro-Silurian volcano-sedimentary rocks or situated below the postglacial marine limit, i. e. in areas not too poor in calcium. The species is an early immigrant, and a landlocked population in Central Norway has probably existed since 8900 14 C-yr B. P. The pearl mussel has become extinct during the past few decades at as many as 30 % of its localities, mostly due to urbanisation and pollution. There is a high correlation between the density of people in a county (or the proportion of cultivated land) and the “density” of extinct pearl mussel populations (r= 0. 91). Other threats considered were hydropower regulations, excavations and <b>constructional</b> <b>work</b> in the watercourse, fishing for pearls, acidification and natural droughts or floods.
