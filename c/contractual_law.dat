40|$|<b>Contractual</b> {{choice of}} <b>law</b> is a universally {{accepted}} conflict of law mechanism, {{and it provides}} the parties {{with the power to}} select the law that governs their business or other private activities across jurisdictional boundaries. An issue that generates heated debates in the United States is whether the law chosen by the parties must bear certain relation as between the enacting state or country and the parties, transaction or dispute. Internationally, such relation is not considered essential to the choice of law by the parties. But in the United States, relation is required in order for the chosen law to be enforceable. In 2001, as part of their initiative to have a broader reform, the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioner on Uniform State Laws attempted to replace U. C. C. § 1 - 105 with § 1 - 301. The major change was the deletion of the “reasonable relation” requirement for <b>contractual</b> choice of <b>law.</b> The replacement was considered a necessary step in the reform, and it was also deemed as an effort to align the U. C. C. with the established international commercial practices. Unfortunately, however, that attempt ultimately failed. Thus, with regard to <b>contractual</b> choice of <b>law,</b> the United States remains considerably at odds with international trends. This article argues that it is conceptually problematic to insist on the relation requirement for the <b>contractual</b> choice of <b>law</b> because such requirement is not only grounded on the misunderstanding of {{the very nature of the}} parties’ autonomy, but also rested with unwarranted concern about state interests. Also as a practical matter, the relation requirement may put American businessmen in a dilemma when they try to reach an agreement with their international counterparts on the choice of law. The failure of the U. C. C. § 1 - 301 revision reflects the persisting hostility in the U. S. towards the power of the parties to select governing law, and also evidences the gap between American conflict of laws and that of other countries. <b>Contractual</b> choice of <b>law</b> in the U. S is now at a crossroads. Both the parties and the state involved would be better off without relation requiremen...|$|R

40|$|Summary: <b>Contractual</b> {{copyright}} <b>law</b> The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse {{the current state of}} regulation of <b>contractual</b> copyright <b>law</b> in the Czech Republic. I have chosen this topic, because I am an amateur photographer and knowledge of different kinds of contracts dealing with copyright might be very useful for me in the future. Knowing most of details affecting final conditions of the contract is the best way, how to exploit my work well, and, what is even more important, I should be able to answer all of questions concerning copyright to my friends (and, in later, professional life, also to my clients). The thesis is thematically divided into seven chapters. The first chapter is introductory and outlines all the content, which is to be dealt with in latter text. It attempts to define the position of copyright in the Czech legal system. Chapter Two focuses on the grounds of contractual techniques and the way of their implementation in the basic civil codex. Furthermore, attention is paid to differences between commercial and civil law, which might be crucial for some side questions of copyright contracts. In Chapter Three, there is the conception and approach of Czech legislature to copyright described. The dichotomy between personal and property rights of authors is explained as well as the nature of [...] ...|$|R

If those defenses are unavailable (for example, because the party resisting enforcement was the one who wrote the contract), New York courts will mechanically enforce the plain language of a contract regardless of its harshness because [...] "a court is not free to alter the contract to reflect its personal notions of fairness and equity." ...|$|E

But the Indian labour market has already achieved a substantial degree of flexibility through the contractualisation of factory workers. We have indexed these labour market flexibilities by the ratio between workers employed through contractors and total number of factory workers. This paper critically investigates the claims made in favour of introducing greater flexibility in the labour market. This is done through an empirical inquiry of the proposition, popular in neo-liberal policy circles, that casualisation of labour leads to higher output and employment growth. We found {{that there is no}} statistically significant dependence of employment and output growth on labour market flexibilities in Indian organized manufacturing sectors.
