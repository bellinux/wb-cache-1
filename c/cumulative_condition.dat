40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{probabilistic}} approach {{for the evaluation}} of the adaptation time for elastic perfectly plastic frames is proposed. The considered load history acting on the structure is defined as a suitable combination of quasi-statical loads and seismic actions. The proposed approach utilizes the Monte Carlo method in order to generate a suitable large number of seismic acceleration histories and for each one the related load combination is defined. Furthermore, for each load combination the related adaptation time is determined, if any, as the optimal one for which the structure is able to shakedown under the unamplified applied actions. A known generalized Ceradini's theorem is utilized. The adaptation time values obtained with reference to all the generated seismic acceleration histories for which the shakedown occurs allows us to define the related <b>cumulative</b> <b>conditioned</b> probability function and, therefore, to identify the optimal adaptation time as the one with a probability not lower than a suitably assigned value...|$|R
40|$|ContextStudents tend to {{postpone}} {{preparation for a}} test until the test is imminent, which raises various risks associated with cramming' behaviours, including that for suboptimal learning. Cumulative assessment utilises spaced testing to stimulate students to study more frequently and to prevent procrastination. This randomised controlled study investigated how cumulative assessment affects time spent on self-study and test performance compared with end-of-course assessment. MethodsA total of 78 undergraduate medical students in a Year 2 pre-clinical course {{were randomly assigned to}} either of two conditions. Students in the <b>cumulative</b> assessment <b>condition</b> were assessed in weeks 4, 8 and 10. Students in the end-of-course assessment condition were assessed in week 10 only. Each week, students reported the number of hours they spent on self-study. ResultsStudents in the <b>cumulative</b> assessment <b>condition</b> (n= 25) spent significantly more time on self-study than students in the end-of-course assessment condition (n= 37) in all weeks of the course except weeks 5, 9 and 10. Overall, the cumulative assessment group spent 69 hours more on self-study during the course than did the control group, although the control group spent 7 hours more in studying during the final week of the course than did the cumulative assessment group. Students in the <b>cumulative</b> assessment <b>condition</b> scored slightly higher on questions concerning the content of {{the last part of the}} course. ConclusionsCumulative assessment encourages students to distribute their learning activities over a course, which leaves them more opportunity to study the content of the last part of the course prior to the final examination. There was no evidence for a short-term effect of cumulative assessment on overall knowledge gain.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of World Bank {{development}} policy lending for public sector governance {{on the quality of}} public sector management and institutions. The World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessments (CPIA) are used to measure the latter, the study considers only policy conditions targeted at improvements in those areas. The analysis uses a comprehensive country-year panel data set of aid receiving-countries and finds a significant and inverse U-shaped effect of public sector conditions on the quality of public sector governance. For most observed values in the data, the impact is positive, but it turns negative beyond a value of 80 conditions. At that point, the predicted CPIA score is about 0. 25 point (0. 3 standard deviation) higher than with zero conditions. For most observations, the number of <b>cumulative</b> <b>conditions</b> is below 80, so the estimated effect of more conditions is generally positive. The analysis corrects for potential endogeneity and shows that the results are robust to sample restrictions, the use of an alternative governance measure, and the inclusion of an extended set of control variables. Falsification tests are also consistent with a causal interpretation from conditions to quality of public sector governance. The paper shows that conditions related to public financial management and tax reforms are more effective than those related to anticorruption or civil service and administrative reform, where progress requires changing the behavior of a larger set of “deconcentrated” actors. The paper concludes by describing some innovative ideas in the Bank’s ambitious new public sector management strategy that could improve the effectiveness of its support for public sector governance reform. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The current EU {{competition}} law enforcement regime {{was created by}} Regulation 1 / 2003 which entered into force on 1 May 2004. In essence, the system {{is based on a}} decentralised model where the European Commission and national competition authorities have parallel competences to apply EU competition provisions. National competition authorities and courts are obliged to apply Articles 101 and 102 TFEU whenever they apply national {{competition law}} to anti-competitive conduct which may affect trade between Member States. Regulation 1 / 2003 does not, however, preclude parallel proceedings being conducted by several competition authorities in connection with the same anti-competitive conduct. The lack of a ban on multiple proceedings is problematic {{in the light of the}} fundamental principle of ne bis in idem which precludes trying and punishing twice for the same criminal offence. This question has become all the more relevant upon the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty which conferred the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union a legally binding status. The ne bis in idem provision inscribed therein provides an EU-wide protection against double prosecution and punishment. Furthermore, ne bis in idem is also recognised as a general principle of EU law, and it is enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights which the Union shall accede to. The principle is intrinsically linked to the doctrine of res judicata and is an element of the right to a fair trial, providing proportionality and upholding legal certainty. It precludes not only an accumulation of sanctions, but also any repetition of proceedings in the same matter. The principle encompasses two elements, namely the notion of the ‘same offence’ (idem) and the aspect of ‘twice’ (bis). Although ne bis in idem traditionally applies only in criminal proceedings, the term ‘criminal’ is interpreted broadly and hence the principle also applies in the enforcement of competition law. The purpose of this study is to examine how the ne bis in idem principle should be interpreted in connection with parallel proceedings carried out in the enforcement of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, and whether the current enforcement regime ensures sufficient compliance with the principle. Can the principle be interpreted as such that it actually precludes multiple investigations and sanctions in connection with the same anti-competitive conduct? These questions are explored from a traditional legal dogmatic approach. In addition to examining primary and secondary legislative tools, this study also refers to soft law instruments. Moreover, analysing court interpretations given to the ne bis in idem principle naturally forms an essential part of this study. Basically, there are three areas of law where the principle has been applied in the EU. First, the Court of Justice has interpreted the principle in competition law matters. Furthermore, the Court has also interpreted the rule in the area of freedom, security and justice where the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement provides the applicable provision. Finally, the European Court of Human Rights has interpreted the ne bis in idem rule in the legal framework of the Council of Europe. The case law analysis shows that the interpretation of the ne bis in idem principle in competition matters differs from the other lines of case law. The main difference is that the application of the principle in the area of competition law is subject to three <b>cumulative</b> <b>conditions,</b> namely identity of the facts, unity of offender and unity of the legal interest protected. By contrast, in other areas of law the only relevant criterion is the identity of facts which naturally comprises the unity of offender. One reason for this discrepancy is that the principle of ne bis in idem originates from criminal law, whereas competition infringements cannot always be directly compared to traditional crimes. Defining what constitutes a same competition infringement for which a second investigation and sanction is precluded is difficult due to the fact that anti-competitive conduct consists of a large number of separate acts committed over a long period of time, sometimes even in the territory of several states. The produced effects are essential when assessing the infringement. The doctrine of the three <b>cumulative</b> <b>conditions</b> as well as other principles for applying the ne bis in idem rule in the context of competition law have been developed by the CJEU roughly during the past four decades. Due to the developments in the field of EU competition policy as well as human and fundamental rights protection, there is room for the Court of Justice to critically re-evaluate its interpretation of the ne bis in idem principle in competition matters and make adjustments to match its view with the current state of affairs. The fundamental right of not being tried or punished twice for the same offence has to be observed also in the enforcement of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} new route plan {{on the basis}} of traffic {{prediction}} for finding a fastest route to a given destination in traffic network. So far, lots of traffic prediction systems were introduced to help drivers. Previous works were done mainly on providing restricted route services which depend on only cumulative traffic velocities. For this reason, we consider both real-time and cumulative traffic information together to obtain more accurate future traffic information. In location-based services, the traffic network is needed to solve certain constrains, such as turns problems and provide method for avoiding traffic congestions. To guide a fastest route service in such a complicated network, we first construct a linear dual graph from a traffic network. Then, we propose main algorithmic approaches which are developed by Kalman Filter and cumulative traffic patterns to predict a much better quality of future traffic information by combining real-time with <b>cumulative</b> traffic <b>conditions.</b> Finally, we adopt Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm to minimize the travel time with generating a fastest cost function. Experimental results show that this approach is highly efficient in route plan than previously used ways by only cumulative approaches.

Here, three-dimensional imaging was applied {{in a study of}} Arabidopsis thaliana leaf growth to determine leaf thickness and the cellular organization of mesophyll tissues under moderate soil water deficit and two <b>cumulative</b> light <b>conditions.</b> In contrast to surface area, thickness was highly conserved in response to water deficit under both low and high cumulative light regimes. Unlike epidermal and palisade mesophyll tissues, no reductions in cell number were observed in the spongy mesophyll; cells had rather changed in volume and shape. Furthermore, leaf features of a selection of genotypes affected in leaf functioning were analysed. The low-starch mutant pgm had very thick leaves because of unusually large palisade mesophyll cells, together with high levels of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. By means of an open stomata mutant and a 9 -cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase overexpressor, it was shown that stomatal conductance does not necessarily {{have a major impact on}} leaf dimensions and cellular organization, pointing to additional mechanisms for the control of CO 2 diffusion under high and low stomatal conductance, respectively. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

Methods We used baseline data from the SPAH study which involved participants aged 65 years and older (n = 2005). The outcome of interest was prevalent dementia. Exposures included in the analyses were socioeconomic position (SEP) indicators in childhood (place of birth and literacy) and adulthood (occupation and income), anthropometric measurements as markers of intrauterine and childhood environment (head circumference and leg length), smoking, diabetes and hypertension. Logistic regression models were {{used to test the}} hypothesized pathways and to assess whether there was an association between cumulative adversities across the life course and prevalent dementia.

40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in large-scale distributed monitoring systems, such as Dynamic Denial of Service attack detectors and sensornet-based environmental monitors. Recent work has posited that these infrastructures lack a critical component, namely a distributed-triggering mechanism that fires when an aggregate of remote-site behavior exceeds some threshold. For several scenarios, the trigger conditions of interest are naturally cumulative, they continuously monitor the accumulation of threshold infractions (e. g., resource overuse) over time. In this paper, we develop a novel framework and communicationefficient protocols to support distributed cumulative triggers. In sharp contrast to earlier work focusing on instantaneous violations, we introduce a general model of threshold conditions that enables us to track distributed cumulative violations over time windows of any size. In our system, a central coordinator efficiently tracks aggregate time-series data at remote sites by adaptively informing the sites how to locally filter their data and when to ship new information. Our proposed algorithmic framework allows us to: (1) provide guarantees on the coordinator’s triggering accuracy; (2) flexibly tradeoff communication overhead versus accuracy; and, (3) develop an analytic solution for computing local filtering parameters. Our work {{is the first to}} solve the problem of communication-efficient monitoring for distributed <b>cumulative</b> trigger <b>conditions</b> using principled solutions with accuracy guarantees.

40|$|Abstract—Technological {{literacy}} education involves {{the teaching of}} basic engineering principles and problem solving, including elementary electrical circuit analysis, to non-engineering students. Learning materials on circuit analysis typically rely on equations and schematic diagrams, which are often unfamiliar to non-en-gineering students. The goal of this experimental {{study was to investigate}} the effects of the integration of equations into circuit diagrams on the learning of non-engineering undergraduate students. This experimental study compared three integration designs. In the cumulative integrated design, as each practice problem solution progressed, the equations were cumulatively integrated into the circuit diagram. In the stepwise integrated design, only those equations relevant to the present step of the problem were integrated into the circuit diagram; previously dis-played equations were moved to an adjacent frame and recorded there. The nonintegrated design recorded all equations in the adja-cent frame throughout each of the problems. Student learning was measured with a problem-solving near-transfer and far-transfer post-test. Students rated the helpfulness of the diagrams and difficulty of the instructional program. Results indicated that participants in the <b>cumulative</b> integrated <b>condition</b> scored sig-nificantly higher on the near-transfer post-test and marginally significantly higher on the far-transfer post-test compared to the stepwise and nonintegrated conditions.

However, our In Rem legislation, {{as is the case in}} most European countries, in the field of property also allows for the acquisition of property right from the non-owner, meaning someone who does not have the disposition ability, in particular with the aim to protect to the greatest extent the legal transactions and thus bona fide acquirers. The possibility of the acquisition of property right from a disposition incapacitated person is provided in the Article 64 of the Property Code, under the heading “Specific cases of acquisition”. However, it is important to emphasize that it is possible to obtain property right despite of the fact that the assumption of disposition ability is not fulfilled, only in cases when all of the <b>cumulative</b> <b>conditions</b> are met as required by the law. In the diploma thesis all the legal conditions for the acquisition of property right from a disposition incapacitated person are discussed, including the judicial practice, which has through court decisions established criteria for assessment of compliance with the legal requirements for the acquisition of property right from a disposition incapacitated person. The majority of the court decisions considered deal with the assessment of the good faith of the acquirer of the property right, whereas a number of court decisions also refer to other legal conditions. In the conclusion of the diploma thesis, I briefly present the problematics of unlawful acquisition of vehicles and the application of the institute of acquisition of property right from the disposition incapacitated person in proceedings of seizure of such vehicles by public authorities, and their subsequent return to their lawful owners. I briefly present the conditions for the liability for damages in cases of unlawful seizures, as well as in cases of possible irregularities concerning the return of seized vehicles to their lawful owners...|$|R

The connecting factor is used as a condition for applying the private interna-tional law consumer protection rules of Regulation (EC) No 44 / 2001 (the Brussels Regulation) and Regulation (EC) No 593 / 2008 (the Rome I Regulation). The two-part connecting factor gives that a consumer contract is eligible for protection only if two <b>cumulative</b> <b>conditions</b> are met. Firstly, the business must have directed its activities to consumer’s jurisdiction or several jurisdictions including that. Secondly, the contract must falls within the scope of such activities. Before addressing the main purpose, it is reviewed what kind of consumer protection these Regulations offer. In addition, the significance of these rules is observed {{in the light of the}} recent developments in fields of procedural and substantial EU consumer law. The perspective of this study is European. The connecting factor is a product of the Europeanized private international law and it is specifically designed to provide protection for consumer engaging in e-commerce. In order to facilitate consumer trust in e-commerce, the circumstances in which consumers can resort to the protective rules should be clearly defined. However, the practical application of the connecting factor has been ambiguous. The main purpose of this study is to identify those legal facts which are relevant when determining if the requirements set down in the connecting factor are satisfied. In addition, the aim is to clarify how much evidential value these facts can bear in practical situations. The analysis is illustrated with examples of situations in which a consumer can, could or cannot enjoy the protection. The methodological focus is on analyzing the relevant case law of the ECJ. The interpretation established in the case law is complemented by analyzing the preparatory works for the relevant community instruments and Advocate Generals’ Opinions. In addition, visions created in academic debate are reviewed in order to see if they are in line with the autonomous interpretation. This study is mainly concerned with consumers’ interests and claims that consumers should be able to foresee their legal position before concluding a contract. In addition, the study acknowledges that consumers’ interests must be balanced against professionals’ interests. The main finding of this study is that, despite the recent case law and academic debate, the practical application of the connecting factor relies on case-by-case evaluation. Thus it is challenging to create clear guidelines for its application. Firstly, when considering if a website accessible in consumer’s jurisdiction constitutes an activity directed to that country, the evaluation should take into account website features and the professional’s overall activity. Consumers can enjoy the protection only if it is apparent that the professional was minded to conclude contracts with customers from consumer’s jurisdiction. Secondly, when determining whether the contract falls within the scope of the directed activities, the evaluation is based on the circumstances which led to the conclusion of the contract and in which the contract is concluded. It is discovered that, if the contract is concluded through the website, it generally falls within the scope of protection. However, if the contract is concluded by other means, there must be evidence indicating that there is a link between the directed activity and the contract. The general finding is that this fact-specific case-by-case evaluation will continue to cause uncertainty for consumers and professionals engaging in cross-border e-commerce...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{field of}} risk {{assessment}} {{has focused on}} protecting the health of individual people or populations of wildlife from single risks, mostly from chemical exposure. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency recently began to address multiple risks to communities in the "Framework for Cumulative Risk Assessment" [EPA/ 630 /P 02 / 001 F. Washington DC: Risk Assessment Forum, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (2003) ]. Simultaneously, several reports concluded that some individuals and groups are more vulnerable to environmental risks than the general population. However, vulnerability has received little specific attention in the risk assessment literature. Objective: Our objective {{is to examine the}} issue of vulnerability in cumulative risk assessment and present a conceptual framework rather than a comprehensive review of the literature. In this article we consider similarities between ecologic and human communities and the factors that make communities vulnerable to environmental risks. Discussion: The literature provides substantial evidence on single environmental factors and simple conditions that increase vulnerability or reduce resilience for humans and ecologic systems. This observation is especially true for individual people and populations of wildlife. Little research directly addresses the topic of vulnerability in cumulative risk situations, especially at the community level. The community level of organization has not been adequately considered as an end point in either human or ecologic risk assessment. Furthermore, current information on human risk does not completely explain the level of response in <b>cumulative</b> risk <b>conditions.</b> Ecologic risk situations are similarly more complex and unpredictable for cases of cumulative risk. Conclusions: Psychosocial conditions and responses are the principal missing element for humans. We propose a model for including psychologic and social factors as an integral component of cumulative risk assessment...|$|R

This study investigated and compared the contractile properties of umbilical arteries excised from obese women, with those excised from women with a normal body mass index (BMI). Methods Sections of umbilical artery were obtained from umbilical cord samples immediately after delivery and mounted for isometric recording in organ tissue baths under physiological <b>conditions.</b> <b>Cumulative</b> additions of 5 -Hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and Prostaglandin F- 2 alpha (PgF 2 alpha) were added in the concentration range of 1 nmol/L to 10 micromol/L. Control vessels were exposed to Krebs physiological salt solution (PSS) only. The resultant effects of each drug addition were measured using the Powerlab hardware unit. Results 5 -HT exerted {{a significant effect on}} human umbilical artery tone at concentrations of 100 nmol/L, 1 micromol/L, and 10 micromol/L in normal (n = 5; P 0. 05). Conclusion These findings support the hypothesis that endogenous regulation of umbilical artery tone is altered in association with maternal obesity. This may be linked to the cardiovascular effects of secretory products of adipose tissue, with implications for the feto-maternal circulation. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{ultrasonic}} Lamb wave measurements are performed to detect material nonlinearity in aluminum sheets. When a Lamb wave propagates, higher harmonic wave fields are generated and {{under certain conditions}} the second harmonic is <b>cumulative.</b> When these <b>conditions</b> hold the Lamb waves are serviceable for material nonlinearity measurements. For generation, a wedge transducer combination is used. The detection of the Lamb wave are performed with either a laser interferometer or a second wedge transducer combination {{and the results are}} benchmarked. A short time Fourier transformation (STFT) is applied to the detected signal to extract the amplitudes of the first and second harmonics. A relative ratio of the first and second harmonics is deduced from nonlinear wave theory to assign the nonlinearity of the material. To verify the capability of the measurement setup and to show that cumulative second harmonics are generated, measurements for different propagation distances are performed. Further measurements on plasticly deformed specimens are carried out to examine the change of the material nonlinearity as a function of plasticity. M. S.

40|$|Due to the {{clinical}} success of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) used for short term 2 ̆ 2 bridge to transplant 2 ̆ 2 {{and the limited}} availability of donor organs, heart assist devices are being considered for long term implantation {{as an alternative to}} heart transplantation. In an effort to improve biocompatibility, a nonthrombogenic cellular lining was developed from genetically engineered smooth muscle cells (GE-SMC) for the Thermocardiosystems Heartmate TM LVAD. SMCs have been transduced with the genes for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS III) and GTP cyclohydrolase (GTPCH) with subsequent stable expression of the NOS III protein via an Epstein Barr based DNA expression vector. Transduced SMCs produce nitric oxide at concentrations that reduce platelet deposition and smooth muscle cell proliferation when tested in vitro. In addition, the adhesive capabilities of GE-SMC linings were also examined, and optimized in physical environments mimicking typical in vivo LVAD operation. Preliminary investigations examining cell adhesion during constant shear stress exposure demonstrated an acute phase of cell loss corresponding to cytoskeletal F-actin rearrangement. Subsequently, an in vitro circulatory loop was designed to expose cell lined LVADs to in vivo operating <b>conditions.</b> <b>Cumulative</b> cell loss from cell lined LVADs was less than 10...|$|R
40|$|Nevtralnost davka na dodano vrednost je v tem, da omogoča pravico do odbitka vstopnega davka na dodano vrednost. Pravica do odbitka vstopnega DDV je vezana na pogoje, ki jih z zakonom predpisuje slovenska nacionalna zakonodaja in pravo ES. Davčni zavezanec sme praviloma pri izračunu svoje davčne obveznosti odbiti vstopni DDV, ki ga je dolžan ali ga je plačal, če so kumulativno izpolnjeni naslednji pogoji: 1. da se DDV nanaša na dobavo blaga ali storitev od drugega davčnega zavezanca 2. da ima davčni zavezanec ustrezen račun 3. da gre za uporabo tega blaga ali storitev za namene njegovih obdavčenih transakcij 4. da ne gre za goljufijo ali zlorabo sistema DDV, oziroma da davčni zavezanec ni vedel ali moral vedeti, da je bila transakcija, na katero se sklicuje pri utemeljitvi pravice do odbitka, povezana z goljufijo, ki jo je storil izdajatelj računa ali drug gospodarski subjekt višje v dobavni verigi. V Sloveniji temeljijo pravila dokaznega bremena na zakonu. Davčni organ mora dokazati dejstva na podlagi katerih davčna obveznost nastane ali ne nastane oz. se poveča ali zmanjša. Davčni zavezanec pa je dolžan za svoje navedbe ponuditi dokaze in jih tudi predložiti. V praksi se izvaja doktrina, da je dokazno breme na davčnem zavezancu. Po sodbi Mahageben, mora davčni organ, ki nosi breme dokazovanja, dokazati, da je inšpicirani davčni zavezanec (profiter, buffer) vedel oz. bi moral vedeti, da sodeluje v goljufiji davčne utaje. Davčni inšpektorji v svojih postopkih ravnajo po ZDavP- 2, ZUP in ZIN, ter nimajo pooblastil za dokazovanje naklepa, kot ga imajo organi pregona za ugotavljanje elementov kaznivih ravnanj po ZKP. Do sodbe Mahageben so bili davčni organi precej uspešnejši pri dokazovanju, kot po izdani sodbi, vendar je razlika predvsem na strani sodišč RS, ki po tej sodbi zahtevajo veliko višji dokazni standard, kot prej. Lahko bi celo rekli, da sodišče pred to sodbo ni zahtevalo dokazovanja o vedenju zavezanca o goljufiji dobavitelja. The {{neutrality}} of {{the value}} added tax (VAT) allows the right to deduct the input value added tax. The right to deduct the input VAT is linked with the conditions which are prescribed by the Slovenian national law and European law as well. Generally, the taxpayer in their calculation of their tax liability could deduct the input VAT which is obliged or paid if the following <b>cumulative</b> <b>conditions</b> are met. Firstly, the VAT shall {{be related to the}} supply of goods or services from another taxable person. Secondly, the taxpayer has the appropriate bank account. Thirdly, the use of the goods or services shall be used for the purposes of its taxable transactions. Finally, the transactions shall not be connected with the tax fraud or abuse of the VAT system. That means that the taxpayer did not know or should have known that the transaction related to the justify of the right of deduction is not connected to the tax fraud which is committed by the issuer of the invoice or other economic operator in the supply chain. In Slovenia, the burden of proof is based on the law. The tax authority shall prove the facts on which the tax liability arises, does not arise, increases or decreases, respectively. Taxpayer is obliged to offer their arguments and submit the evidence. In practice, it carries out the doctrine that the burden of proof bears on the taxpayer. Following the judgment of Mahageben, the tax authority which bears the burden of proof has to demonstrate that the inspected taxpayer (profiter, buffer) knew or should know that participates itself in the fraud of tax evasion. In Slovenia, the tax inspectors in their procedures comply with the Tax Procedure Act, the Administrative Procedure Act and the Inspection Act, and they are not authorized to prove the intent like the law enforcement authorities which are focused to determine the elements of the offense according to the Criminal Procedure Act. Until the judgment of Mahageben,the tax authorities were quite successful in demonstrating the proofs as the judgment was issued, but the difference is mainly {{on the side of the}} courts of the Republic of Slovenia which after this judgement require much higher standard of the burden of proof than before. We could even say that the court before this judgment does not require any proof of the taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge about the tax fraud of the supplier...|$|R
40|$|Bridge design {{should take}} into account not only safety and functionality, but also the cost {{effectiveness}} of investments throughout a bridge life-cycle. This work presents a probabilistic approach to compute the life-cycle cost (LCC) of corroding reinforced concrete (RC) bridges in earthquake prone regions. The approach is developed by combining cumulative seismic damage and damage associated to corrosion due to environmental <b>conditions.</b> <b>Cumulative</b> seismic damage is obtained from a low-cycle fatigue analysis. Chloride-induced corrosion of steel reinforcement is computed based on Fick?s second law of diffusion. The proposed methodology accounts for the uncertainties in the ground motion parameters, the distance from source, the seismic demand on the bridge, and the corrosion initiation time. The statistics of the accumulated damage {{and the cost of}} repairs throughout the bridge life-cycle are obtained by Monte-Carlo simulation. As an illustration of the proposed approach, the effect of design parameters on the life-cycle cost of an example RC bridge is studied. The results are shown to be valuable in better estimating the condition of existing bridges (i. e., total accumulated damage at any given time) and, therefore, can help schedule inspection and maintenance programs. In addition, by taking into consideration the deterioration process over a bridge life-cycle, it is possible to make an estimate of the optimum design parameters by minimizing, for example, the expected cost throughout the life of the structure...|$|R
