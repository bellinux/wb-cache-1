5|$|A {{key action}} which {{physically}} connects {{the keys and}} the windchests is a mechanical or tracker action. <b>Connection</b> <b>is</b> achieved {{through a series of}} rods called trackers. When the organist depresses a key, the corresponding tracker pulls open its pallet, allowing wind to enter the pipe.|$|E
5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E
5|$|Readville has {{an unusual}} layout {{because it is}} built on the {{crossing}} of two rail lines. The Fairmount Line and Franklin Line each have a single track atop an embankment. The Fairmount Line has a single side platform, while the Franklin Line has two. The Fairmount Line track continues atop a bridge over the Northeast Corridor to join with the Franklin Line. This <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> used by several trains each rush hour, allowing trains from the Franklin Line to avoid congestion in the crowded Southwest Corridor.|$|E

30|$|Structural {{connectivity}} results (i.e., fiber density values) for {{the three}} groups are reported in Table  2, which shows the {{mean and standard deviation}} (SD) for the fiber density values of 16 <b>connections.</b> The values <b>were</b> computed from both hemispheres. Overall, nine <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> significantly different between PD and NC. Of these <b>connections,</b> seven <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> smaller in PD compared with NC and two <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> smaller in NC compared with PD (p <  0.05, corrected). Four <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> significantly different between SWEDD and NC. Among these <b>connections,</b> two <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> smaller in NC and two <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> smaller in SWEDD (p <  0.05, corrected). Nine connections showed significant differences between PD and SWEDD. Among these <b>connections,</b> seven <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> smaller in PD and two <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> smaller in SWEDD (p <  0.05, corrected). PD patients showed significant connection differences compared with NC in associative cortex–caudate, associative cortex–thalamus, limbic cortex–caudate, limbic cortex–putamen, limbic cortex-thalamus, sensorimotor cortex–caudate, sensorimotor cortex–putamen, pallidum–putamen and pallidum–thalamus connections. SWEDD patients showed significant differences compared with NC in associative cortex–caudate, associative cortex–thalamus, sensorimotor cortex–putamen, pallidum–putamen and SN–thalamus connections. PD patients showed significant connection differences compared with SWEDD in associative cortex–thalamus, limbic cortex–caudate, limbic cortex–putamen, limbic cortex–thalamus, sensorimotor cortex–caudate, sensorimotor cortex–putamen, pallidum–putamen, pallidum–thalamus and putamen–thalamus connections. Associative cortex–thalamus, sensorimotor cortex–putamen and pallidum–putamen <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> commonly identified as significant in NC-PD, SWEDD-NC and SWEDD-PD comparisons, as shown in italic font in Table  2.|$|R
30|$|The pallidum–putamen and {{sensorimotor}} cortex–putamen <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> {{significantly correlated}} with clinical scores, while associative cortex–thalamus <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> not correlated with clinical scores. The pallidum–putamen <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> reported as a key pathway for motor control within the CBGT circuit (Obeso et al. 2000). The sensorimotor cortex–putamen <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> related to motor control via glutamatergic projections in the cortico-striatal pathway. Pallidum–putamen and sensorimotor cortex–putamen <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> correlated with MDS-UPDRS scores, which might corroborate the existing research. The associative cortex–thalamus <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> reported as playing a secondary role in processing motor information and thus, might be less linked to MDS-UPDRS scores {{than the other two}} connections (Purves et al. 2008). Thus, we believe that pallidum–putamen and sensorimotor cortex–putamen connections might form a structural connectivity profile unique to SWEDD that could be a potential imaging biomarker for future movement disorder research.|$|R

5|$|An {{additional}} two-track <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> planned {{between the}} line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue. Current plans do not call {{for it to be}} used by regular service, but instead to be used for non-revenue moves and to provide a connection to the Jamaica subway yard. The connection would allow for trains to run from the Financial District to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Bypass was built. Service from Queens via the 63rd Street Tunnel would allow for the full capacity of the line south of 63rd Street to be used. Plans include provisions for an extension north under Second Avenue past 125th Street to the Bronx, and an extension south to Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day {{prosperity}} theology borrows heavily from the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} the <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> sometimes unclear. Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the cargo cult phenomenon. While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, he argues that it can also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though he notes that it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change.|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, {{the caller is}} connected to the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number. Once the <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small microphone in the caller's handset. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E
5000|$|In mobile {{cellular}} telephony networks like GSM and UMTS the SS7 application MAP <b>is</b> used. Voice <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> Circuit Switched (CS) and data <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> Packet Switched (PS) applications.|$|R

Freenet developers describe the trust needed as “will not crack their Freenet node”. [...] Opennet <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> easy to use, but darknet <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> more secure against attackers on the network, {{and can make}} it difficult for an attacker (such as an oppressive government) to even determine that a user is running Freenet in the first place.|$|R
50|$|The {{difference}} of two adapted <b>connections</b> <b>is</b> a 1-form on M with {{values in the}} adjoint bundle AdQ. That is to say, the space AQ of adapted <b>connections</b> <b>is</b> an affine spacefor &Omega;1(AdQ).|$|R
5|$|In most species, {{the sexes}} are {{separate}} {{and there is}} little sexual dimorphism, but a few species are hermaphroditic and some parasitic forms show large differences between the sexes. Some Cymothoidans are protandrous hermaphrodites, starting life as males and later changing sex, and some Anthuroideans are the reverse, being protogynous hermaphrodites that are born female. Some Gnathiidans males are sessile and live with a group of females. Males have a pair of penises, which may be fused in some species. The sperm is transferred to the female by the modified second pleopod which receives it from the penis and which is then inserted into a female gonopore. The sperm is stored in a special receptacle, a swelling on the oviduct close to the gonopore. Fertilisation only takes place when the eggs are shed soon after a moult, at which time a <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> established between the semen receptacle and the oviduct.|$|E
5|$|Juliomys anoblepas {{is similar}} to the other members of its genus in the {{configuration}} of its zygomatic plate (a bony plate {{on the side of the}} skull). It hardly extends forward in front of the connection between the plate and the main body of the skull, and that <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> relatively low on the skull. Furthermore, the incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend to a point between the first molars, and the palate is short, with its back margin between the third molars. The living species of Juliomys differ from J.anoblepas in various characters, including shorter incisive foramina in two species and the shape of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) in J.anoblepas. The upper molar row is 4.13mm long, which makes J.anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys.|$|E
5|$|NY454 {{continues}} as a four-lane arterial {{through a large}} commercial district, intersecting with CR93 (Lakeland Avenue). There, the highway passes Long Island MacArthur Airport and bends to the east through another large commercial district remaining unchanged for several miles. The route turns to the southeast at Coates Avenue as a four-lane arterial {{for the last two}} miles (3.2km) of NY454. About three miles (4.8km) from Lakeland Avenue, NY454 connects to the Sunrise Highway (NY27) at exit51, a partial interchange in Holbrook. Here, the NY454 designation ends and its right-of-way merges into the eastbound service road of NY27. There is no access to westbound Sunrise Highway from NY454 itself; instead, the <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> made by way of nearby Broadway Avenue.|$|E

30|$|In this study, the {{behavior}} of beam-column <b>connections</b> <b>was</b> investigated when the <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> under blast loads. Specimens were designed as monolithic connections which have advantage to resist the blast loads, as mentioned earlier (Dusenberry 2010).|$|R
50|$|The {{increasing}} {{usage of}} ICs (integrated circuits) with packages such as BGAs (ball grid array) where the <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> underneath the chip and not visible, means that ordinary optical inspection is impossible. Because the <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> underneath the chip package {{there is a}} greater need to ensure that the manufacturing process is able to accommodate these chips correctly. Additionally the chips that use BGA packages tend to be the larger ones with many <b>connections.</b> Therefore, it <b>is</b> essential that all the <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> made correctly.|$|R
5|$|Newton's Second Law asserts {{the direct}} {{proportionality}} of acceleration to {{force and the}} inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements. However, while kinematics are well-described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain {{as to what is}} the proper definition of mass. General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unclear as to how or whether this <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> relevant on microscales. With some justification, Newton's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.|$|E
5|$|One man, whose {{influence}} {{more than}} any other one thing, succeeded in laying a foundation for Dartmouth's wonderful results, but whose name is seldom mentioned in that <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> Doctor Wurtenberg, who was brought up in the early Yale football school.

Four critical years he worked with us filling every one with his enthusiasm and those four years Dartmouth football gained such headway that nothing could stop its growth.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in basidiomycetes {{is similar}} to that of the ascomycetes. Compatible haploid hyphae fuse to produce a dikaryotic mycelium. However, the dikaryotic phase is more extensive in the basidiomycetes, often also present in the vegetatively growing mycelium. A specialized anatomical structure, called a clamp <b>connection,</b> <b>is</b> formed at each hyphal septum. As with the structurally similar hook in the ascomycetes, the clamp connection in the basidiomycetes is required for controlled transfer of nuclei during cell division, to maintain the dikaryotic stage with two genetically different nuclei in each hyphal compartment. A basidiocarp is formed in which club-like structures known as basidia generate haploid basidiospores after karyogamy and meiosis. The most commonly known basidiocarps are mushrooms, but they may also take other forms (see Morphology section).|$|E
40|$|A four-parametric {{family of}} linear {{connections}} preserving the almost complex structure is defined on an almost complex manifold with Norden metric. Necessary and sufficient conditions for these <b>connections</b> to <b>be</b> natural are obtained.

The curvature tensors of these <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> proved to coincide...|$|R
50|$|Clamp <b>connections</b> <b>are</b> {{structures}} {{unique to}} the phylum Basidiomycota. Many fungi from this phylum produce spores in basidiocarps (fruiting bodies, or mushrooms), above ground.

As such, the presence or absences of clamp <b>connections</b> has <b>been</b> a tool in categorizing genera and species.|$|R
50|$|The first {{connection}} to the new Berlin Ringbahn was built in 1879 when a <b>connection</b> <b>was</b> built in Fürstenbrunn to the Charlottenburg-Westend freight yard (now Westend).

5|$|The Kačić family {{originated}} in the Zadar hinterland near the Krka river, and when King Petar Krešimir IV mastered the Pagania, {{some members of the}} family likely relocated to the area between the Cetina and Neretva rivers. The social distinction between noble Kačićs in the Zadar-Biograd hinterland and the princely (knezes) Kačićs from Omiš remains uncertain, but the two families are considered to be related.

5|$|The PC version {{received}} less favorable reviews overall. Critics of it noted the unrefined controls, limited framerate to 30 FPS, {{and a lack}} of anti-aliasing or other advanced graphics options. Ubisoft's DRM for the game, in particular, received many complaints since a constant Internet <b>connection</b> <b>is</b> required when launching the game, even though it was initially reported that the game would simply require a one-time-only activation. There were also a large number of reports that the PC version had crashing issues, glitches, and a small bracket of supported graphics cards, rendering the game unplayable for some. Ubisoft later announced that it was developing a patch that would enable offline authentication; players who were unwilling to wait could ask for a refund.|$|E

It is viable for future construction of the bypass or the Northern Boulevard transfer station. The original bellmouth stopped at 29th Street. The lower level of the bellmouth was excavated in 2003 for the LIRR East Side Access project, which also extended the subway stub tracks farther east towards Sunnyside Yard. Just above the connection sits the 29th Street Ventilation Complex, built with the connector, in {{the site of a}} former parking lot. West of the station, a second ventilation complex lies in Queensbridge Park between Vernon Boulevard and the East River.|$|E
