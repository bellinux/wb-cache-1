Recent thinking in the philosophy and history of science {{has led to an}} abandonment of some versions of logical positivism and of verificationism that had a strong deductive and theory testing orientation. What is to replace them is less clear. This paper argues that {{progress and}} cumulation {{can be seen as a}} process of evaluation and retention within an epistemic community. Scholarly disciplines differ in their social structure and in their epistemic and normative commitments. Since sociology is a fragmented discipline, progress and cumulation differ within its multiple subdisciplines, which to varying extents represent epistemic communities. Brief sketches of progress (advance) and <b>cumulation</b> <b>in</b> several subdisciplines are offered...|$|R
