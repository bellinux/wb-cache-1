5|$|By {{the time}} they were ready for their first {{practical}} installation, they heard that one of their members, Girja Sharan, had obtained a grant to construct a dew condenser in Kothara, India. In April 2001, Sharan had incidentally noticed substantial condensation on the roof of a cottage at Toran Beach Resort in the arid <b>coastal</b> <b>region</b> of Kutch, where he was briefly staying. The following year, he investigated the phenomenon more closely and interviewed local people. Financed by the Gujarat Energy Development Agency and the World Bank, Sharan and his team went on to develop passive, radiative condensers for use in the arid <b>coastal</b> <b>region</b> of Kutch. Active commercialisation began in 2006.|$|E

40|$|Corrosion can seriously {{affect the}} service life of {{components}} for solar energy conversion. We present results of mapping {{the potential of}} atmospheric corrosion in <b>coastal</b> <b>regions</b> {{with the aid of}} a Geographical Information System (GIS). Concentration of sea salt aerosols, which are the main atmospheric pollutants in maritime <b>coastal</b> <b>regions,</b> gives an indication of the probability of the atmospheric corrosion leading to PV-module degradation. Two approaches to estimate the distribution of sea salt aerosol across the <b>coastal</b> <b>regions</b> worldwide are investigated. The first approach is a geo-statistical analysis that has been used for interpolating chloride deposition data. The second approach is based on modeling the environmental conditions, which are affecting source and distribution of airborne salinity. The comparison of these two approaches provides high accuracy in the description of the variation in airborne salinity across the <b>coastal</b> <b>regions.</b> The assessment of the atmospheric corrosion in <b>coastal</b> <b>regions</b> is based on the international standard ISO 9223. The corrosivity classification is simply defined by three parameters: SO 2 pollution, airborne salinity, and relative humidity. A combination of the results from the geo-statistical approach and modeling is used; the result is a map of atmospheric corrosion in <b>coastal</b> <b>regions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Saladin went to Alexandria in 1171–72 {{and found}} himself facing the dilemma of having many {{supporters}} in the city, but little money. A family council was held there by the Ayyubid emirs of Egypt where {{it was decided that}} al-Muzaffar Taqi al-Din Umar, Saladin's nephew, would launch an expedition against the <b>coastal</b> <b>region</b> of Barqa (Cyrenaica) west of Egypt with a force of 500 cavalry. In order to justify the raid, a letter was sent to the Bedouin tribes of Barqa, rebuking them for their robberies of travelers and ordering them to pay the alms-tax (zakat). The latter was to be collected from their livestock.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} current {{condition}} and spatial {{dynamics of the}} key socioeconomic processes in the coastal zone of the European subcontinent {{at the turn of}} the 20 th century. Europe is a region where the "coastal component" of socioeconomic development plays a major role and is therefore one of the most interesting objects for research in this field. Russian geographical proximity to the European countries, a significant number of shared problems, and a considerable potential for cooperation in solving them and developing the world ocean's resources create grounds for an integrated study of European <b>coastal</b> <b>regions.</b> The author analyses Russian findings in the field of the socioeconomic development of <b>coastal</b> <b>regions.</b> The differences in the natural and socioeconomic conditions and resources along a significant portion of the European coastline necessitate the zoning of subcontinent's coastal territories and contiguous water areas. The findings of EU maritime research constitute the economic and statisti cal basis of the study, whose author, relying on necessary calculations, proposes a new concept of <b>coastal</b> <b>regions.</b> The study identifies significant differences in the nature and trends in the development of European <b>coastal</b> <b>regions</b> in the first decade of the 21 st century. Thus, Russian <b>coastal</b> <b>regions</b> show the most dynamic development rate. In general, <b>coastal</b> <b>regions</b> are not superior to inland European regions in terms of major development rates...|$|R

They occupy a large stretch of the eastern <b>coastal</b> <b>region</b> of Madagascar, from Mananjary {{in the south to}} Antalaha in the north. The Betsimisaraka {{have a long history of}} extensive interaction with European seafarers and traders that produced a significant subset with mixed European-Malagasy origins, termed the zana-malata. European influence is evident in the local valse (waltz) and basesa musical genres, which are typically performed on the accordion.

5|$|From a phytogeographic viewpoint, the {{southern}} part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions: the Gangetic plain and the littoral mangrove forests of the Sundarbans. The alluvial soil of the Gangetic plain, combined with favourable rainfall, makes this region especially fertile. Much of the vegetation of {{the western part of the}} state has similar species composition with the plants of the Chota Nagpur plateau in the adjoining state of Jharkhand. The predominant commercial tree species is Shorea robusta, commonly known as the sal tree. The <b>coastal</b> <b>region</b> of Purba Medinipur exhibits coastal vegetation; the predominant tree is the Casuarina. A notable tree from the Sundarbans is the ubiquitous sundari (Heritiera fomes), from which the forest gets its name.|$|E
5|$|In 1714 Farrukhsiyar, the Mughal emperor, {{appointed}} Asif Jah I to be Viceroy of the Deccan, {{with the}} title Nizam-ul-Mulk (Administrator of the Realm). In 1724, Asif Jah I defeated Mubariz Khan to establish autonomy over the Deccan Suba, named the region Hyderabad Deccan, and started {{what came to be}} known as the Asif Jahi dynasty. Subsequent rulers retained the title Nizam ul-Mulk and were referred to as Asif Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad. The death of Asif Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons, backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces, contended for the throne. The accession of Asif Jah II, who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability. In 1768 he signed the treaty of Machilipatnam, surrendering the <b>coastal</b> <b>region</b> to the East India Company in return for a fixed annual rent.|$|E
5|$|In Gampaha District, Tamils have {{historically}} inhabited the <b>coastal</b> <b>region.</b> In the Puttalam District, {{there was a}} substantial ethnic Tamil population until the first two decades of the 20th century. Most of those who identify as ethnic Tamils live in villages such as Udappu and Maradankulam. There are also Tamil Christians, chiefly Roman Catholics, who have preserved their heritage in the major cities such as Negombo, Chilaw, Puttalam, and also in villages such as Mampuri. Some residents of these two districts, especially the traditional fishermen, are bilingual, ensuring that the Tamil language survives as a lingua franca among migrating fishing communities across the island. Negombo Tamil dialect is spoken by about 50,000 people. This number does not include others, outside of Negombo city, who speak local varieties of the Tamil language.|$|E

5|$|NC 98 first {{appeared}} in 1930 as a state route connecting NC 91 and NC 102 in the <b>coastal</b> <b>region</b> of North Carolina. That routing was abolished in 1931 {{in favor of an}} extended NC 58. The current routing of NC 98 was established in 1934 with the road's western terminus at NC 91 (present-day Jones Dairy Road) to US 64 west of Spring Hope. In 1941, NC 98 was moved to a new section of road running from Zebulon Road to US1 in Youngsville, which would later become part of NC 96. In 1952, NC 98 was again relocated along NC 264 through Wake Forest to Durham, and NC 96 took over its abandoned section. In 2003, a bypass was completed around Wake Forest leading to the rerouting of mainline NC98 to the bypass and the establishment of a business route through the town center.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Khe Sanh was {{the seat of}} {{government}} of Huong Hoa district, an area of Bru Montagnard villages and coffee plantations, situated about seven miles from the Laotian frontier on Route 9, the northernmost transverse road in South Vietnam.
