5|$|In the 1990s, {{a series}} of Historical Public Exposure Studies were {{conducted}} to assess past releases and public exposures. For example, the figure at right illustrates the calculated lifetime <b>cancer</b> <b>risk</b> to a laborer from the 1957 Rocky Flats fire. The key shows the <b>cancer</b> <b>risk</b> due to exposure during the 1957 event per million persons. This figure means that an outdoor laborer in the reddest part of Arvada would have roughly a two-in-a-million risk of contracting cancer (0.000002) from being outside during the 1957 fire. The original, complete figure - {{as well as many}} others showing the risks of past exposures - can be viewed in the Summary of Findings from the Historical Public Exposure Studies.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium is more {{dangerous}} when inhaled than when ingested. The risk {{of lung cancer}} increases once the total radiation dose equivalent of inhaled plutonium exceeds 400 mSv. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the lifetime <b>cancer</b> <b>risk</b> from inhaling 5,000 plutonium particles, each about 3µm wide, to be 1% over the background U.S. average. Ingestion or inhalation of large amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and possibly death. However no human being {{is known to have}} died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium, and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies.|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} concern regarding radiation-related second-cancer risks in long-term radiotherapy survivors and a corresponding {{need to be}} able to predict <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> at high radiation doses. Although <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> at moderately low radiation doses are reasonably understood from atomic bomb survivor studies, there is much more uncertainty at the high doses used in radiotherapy. It has generally been assumed that cancer induction decreases rapidly at high doses due to cell killing. However, recent studies of radiation-induced second cancers in the lung and breast, covering a very wide range of doses, contradict this assumption. A likely resolution of this disagreement comes from considering cellular repopulation during and after radiation exposure. Such repopulation tends to counteract cell killing and accounts for the large discrepancies between the current standard model for cancer induction at high doses and recent second-cancer data. We describe and apply a biologically based minimally parameterized model of dose-dependent <b>cancer</b> <b>risks,</b> incorporating carcinogenic effects, cell killing, and, additionally, proliferation/repopulation effects. Including stem-cell repopulation leads to risk estimates consistent with high-dose second-cancer data. A simplified version of the model provides a practical and parameter-free approach to predicting high-dose <b>cancer</b> <b>risks,</b> based only on data for atomic bomb survivors (who were exposed to lower total doses) and the demographic variables of the population of interest. Incorporating repopulation effects provides both a mechanistic understanding of <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> at high doses and a practical methodology for predicting <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> in organs exposed to high radiation doses, such as during radiotherapy...|$|R

5|$|Cancers can {{be induced}} in animals at many sites. At {{sufficiently}} high doses TCDD has caused cancer in all animals tested. The most sensitive is liver cancer in female rats, {{and this has}} long been a basis for risk assessment. Dose-response of TCDD in causing cancer {{does not seem to be}} linear, and there is a threshold below which it seems to cause no cancer. TCDD is not mutagenic or genotoxic, in other words, it is not able to initiate cancer, and the <b>cancer</b> <b>risk</b> is based on promotion of cancer initiated by other compounds or on indirect effects such as disturbing defense mechanisms of the body e.g. by preventing apoptosis or programmed death of altered cells. Carcinogenicity is associated with tissue damage, and it is often viewed now as secondary to tissue damage.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{infected}} with H. pylori have a 10 to 20% lifetime {{risk of developing}} peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2% risk of acquiring stomach cancer. Inflammation of the pyloric antrum {{is more likely to}} lead to duodenal ulcers, while inflammation of the corpus (body of the stomach) is more likely to lead to gastric ulcers and gastric carcinoma. However, H. pylori possibly plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis. A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication of H. pylori reduces gastric <b>cancer</b> <b>risk</b> in previously infected individuals, suggesting the continued presence of H. pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for gastric cancers; in terms of absolute risk, the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.|$|E
5|$|The {{carcinogenity}} of chromate dust {{has been}} known for a long time, and in 1890 the first publication described the elevated <b>cancer</b> <b>risk</b> of workers in a chromate dye company. Three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the genotoxicity of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the DNA. The last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of the end product of the chromium(III) reduction.|$|E

5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited causal link between abortion and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion {{as a cause of}} breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that abortion is not associated with an increase in breast <b>cancer</b> <b>risk,</b> and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E
5|$|TCDD was {{classified}} in 1997 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a carcinogen for humans (group 1). In the occupational cohort studies {{available for the}} classification, the risk, even at very high exposures, was weak and borderline detectable. Therefore, human data were not deemed sufficient, and the classification was, in essence, based on animal experiments and mechanistic considerations. This has been criticized as a deviation from IARC classification rules. It is much debated whether TCDD is carcinogenic only at high doses which also cause toxic damage of tissues. Moreover, a recent review concludes that, after 1997, further studies do not support an association between TCDD exposure and <b>cancer</b> <b>risk.</b> New studies include the update of Vietnam veteran studies from Ranch Hand operation, which concluded that after 30 years the results do not provide evidence of disease.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} BRCA 1 / 2 mutation carriers' cumulative ovarian <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> after risk-reducing salpingectomy {{at various}} ages with delayed oophorectomy {{several years later}} compared with risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy. METHODS: A literature search was performed on cumulative ovarian <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> and effects of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy and salpingectomy. Results were used in a modeling study to estimate cumulative ovarian <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> for various scenarios of salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Estimated cumulative ovarian <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> at age 70 years for risk-reducing salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy are highest for BRCA 1 mutation carriers undergoing surgeries at higher age. Maximum increase in point estimates (from 1. 8 % to 4. 1 %) occurs in 40 -year-old BRCA 1 mutation carriers undergoing oophorectomy at age 45 years after nonprotective salpingectomy instead of salpingo-oophorectomy at age 40 years. In the best-case scenario, assuming 65 % risk reduction by salpingectomy and 96 % by salpingo-oophorectomy, point estimates increase (from 1. 8 % to 2. 6 %) or decrease (from 3. 4 % to 3. 3 %) depending on age. In the worst-case scenario for BRCA 2, point estimates maximally increase from 0. 6 % to 1. 8 % in 45 -year-old carriers when oophorectomy is performed at age 50 years instead of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy at age 45 years. In the best-case scenario, point estimates increase (from 1. 3 % to 1. 5 %) or decrease (from 1. 5 to 1. 3 %). CONCLUSION: Differences in estimated ovarian <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> between risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy and salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy are small, even if salpingectomy is ineffective. Presented estimated ovarian <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> {{can be used in}} counseling BRCA 1 / 2 mutation carriers, thereby facilitating a personalized and well-informed choice for either strategy...|$|R

In three women, 43, 50 and 61 years of age, there was a {{family history of}} ovarian cancer. In the youngest woman breast carcinoma was diagnosed and she was referred for genetic counseling and DNA mutation analysis. She was identified with a pathogenic mutation in BRCA 1 and decided for regular breast examination and prophylactic adnectomy. The 50 -year-old woman presented with ovarian cancer and was found to have a BRCA 1 mutation. She received surgery and chemotherapy for her ovarian cancer and regular examination of the breasts. The third woman at risk could be reassured, since she did not carry the BRCA 1 mutation that was found in her affected sister. Because the patients and their family members can benefit from regular surveillance and prophylactic surgery, it is of great importance to identify the high breast <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> as well as the high ovarian <b>cancer</b> <b>risks</b> in these families...|$|R
