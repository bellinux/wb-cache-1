25|$|Pellagra is {{most common}} to populations within {{developing}} {{countries in which}} corn is the dietary staple. The disease has virtually disappeared from industrialized countries, yet still appears in India and parts of China and Africa. This is {{in part due to}} the bound form of niacin that unprocessed corn contains, which is not readily absorbed into the human body. The processes involved in making <b>corn</b> <b>tortillas,</b> can release the bound niacin into a more absorbable form. Pellegra is not problematic in countries which traditionally prepare their corn in this way, but is a problem in other countries where unprocessed corn is main source of caloric intake.|$|E
