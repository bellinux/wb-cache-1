5|$|Beginning {{with the}} pilot, Miller {{structured}} each episode by telling two {{stories in the}} episode. The first was a traditional procedural plotline. The second story was a flashback from Henry's past. The flashback either related to the episode's main present-day storyline, such as Henry's involvement in investigating the Jack the Ripper <b>case,</b> <b>or</b> was a scene from Henry's backstory, such as {{his life in the}} Lower East Side's tenements in the 1890s. Both the father-son relationship between Henry and Abe and one of the two season-long story arcs, Henry's relationship with his wife Abigail, were told through flashbacks.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To locate {{sources of}} {{occupational}} exposure to nasal and bladder carcinogens for surveillance follow up in British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: Incident cases of nasal cancer (n = 48), bladder cancer (n = 105), and population based controls (n = 159) matched for sex and age, were interviewed about their jobs, exposures, and smoking histories. Odds ratios (ORs) {{were calculated for}} 57 occupational groups with stratified exact methods to control for age, sex, and smoking. RESULTS: Occupational groups at increased risk of nasal cancer included: textile workers (six <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 7. 6); miners, drillers, and blasters (six <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 3. 5); welders (two <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 3. 5); pulp and paper workers (three <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 3. 1); and plumbers and pipefitters (two <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 3. 0). Nasal cancer ORs were not increased in occupations exposed to wood dust, possibly due to low exposures in local wood industries. Strongly increased risks of bladder cancer were found for sheet metal workers (four <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 5. 3), miners (19 <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 4. 5), gardeners (six <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 3. 7), and hairdressers (three <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 3. 2). Among occupations originally considered at risk, the following had increased risks of bladder cancer: painters (four <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 2. 8); laundry workers (five <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 2. 3); chemical and petroleum workers (15 <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 1. 8); machinists (eight <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 1. 6); and textile workers (three <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 1. 5). CONCLUSIONS: Occupational groups with increased risks and three <b>or</b> more <b>cases</b> with similar duties were selected for surveillance follow up. For nasal cancer, these included textile workers (five were garment makers) and pulp and paper workers (three performed maintenance tasks likely to entail stainless steel welding). For bladder cancer, these included miners (12 worked underground), machinists (five worked in traditional machining), hairdressers (three had applied hair dyes), and laundry workers (three were drycleaners) ...|$|R

5|$|Roughly speaking, Mongolian {{has eight}} cases: {{nominative}} (unmarked), genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, instrumental, comitative and directional. If a direct object is definite, it {{must take the}} accusative, while it must take the nominative if it is unspecific. In addition to case, a number of postpositions exist that usually govern genitive, ablative, or comitative <b>case</b> <b>or</b> a form of the nominative that has sometimes -Vn either for lexical historical reasons or analogy (thus maybe becoming an attributive case suffix). Nouns can take reflexive-possessive clitics indicating that the marked noun is possessed by {{the subject of the}} sentence: bi najz(-)aa avarsan I friend- save- 'I saved my friend'. However, there are also somewhat noun-like adjectives to which case suffixes seemingly cannot be attached directly unless there is ellipsis. Plurality may be left unmarked, but there are overt plurality markers, some of which are restricted to humans. A noun that is modified by a numeral usually does not take any plural affix.|$|E

5|$|Slade's <b>Case</b> (<b>or</b> Slade v. Morley) {{was a case}} in English {{contract}} law that ran from 1596 to 1602. Under the medieval common law, claims seeking the repayment of a debt or other matters could only be pursued through a writ of debt in the Court of Common Pleas, a problematic and archaic process. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded in creating another method, enforced by the Court of King's Bench, through the action of assumpsit, which was technically for deceit. The legal fiction used was that by failing to pay after promising to do so, a defendant had committed deceit, and was liable to the plaintiff. The conservative Common Pleas, through the appellate court the Court of Exchequer Chamber, began to overrule decisions made by the King's Bench on assumpsit, causing friction between the courts.|$|E
5|$|The Court has no {{original}} {{jurisdiction in}} most cases, {{meaning that it}} can only hear cases appealed to the Court after having been previously heard in lower courts. Most cases begin in local circuit courts, where the initial trial is held and a jury decides {{the outcome of the}} case. The circuit court decision can be appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals or the Indiana Tax Court, who can hear the <b>case</b> <b>or</b> enforce the lower court's decision. If the parties still disagree with the outcome of the case, they can appeal the decision to the Indiana Supreme Court. The Court can choose to hear the case and possibly overturn the previous judgment, or it can decline to accept the case and uphold the decision of the lower courts.|$|E

On March 27, 2012, it was reported that 20th Century Fox had the poster and trailer removed from Florida theaters in response to increasing controversy surrounding the February shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida by neighborhood-watch captain George Zimmerman.

According to insiders Fox intended to move into the next phase of the {{marketing campaign}} as soon as possible (focusing on the film's science-fiction aspects), while replacing previous posters with images of the cast.

5|$|The Royal Mail <b>Case</b> <b>or</b> R v Kylsant & Otrs was a noted English {{criminal}} case in 1931. The {{director of the}} Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Lord Kylsant, had falsified a trading prospectus {{with the aid of}} the company accountant to make it look as if the company was profitable and to entice potential investors. Following an independent audit instigated by HM Treasury, Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor, were arrested and charged with falsifying both the trading prospectus and company records and accounts. Although they were acquitted of falsifying records and accounts, Kylsant was found guilty of falsifying the trading prospectus and sentenced to twelve months in prison. The company was then liquidated, and reconstituted as The Royal Mail Lines Ltd with the backing of the British government.|$|E
5|$|The {{database}} {{would not}} hold <b>case</b> <b>or</b> assessment material or any subjective observations. The database could include information of a 'sensitive' nature, defined as {{issues relating to}} sexual health, mental health and substance abuse, although consent from the child or the childâ€™s guardians would have been needed, {{and it would not}} have appeared as such on the database; it would only note that the child was receiving help from 'sensitive services' and would not say what this was. Refusal of consent could be overridden if this could be justified. Margaret Hodge, then childrenâ€™s minister, had said that drug or alcohol use by parents, relatives and neighbours, together with other aspects of their behaviour, may be recorded. Government guidelines reveal that other information recorded may have included 'family routines', evidence of a 'disorgan-ised/chaotic lifestyle', 'ways in which the familyâ€™s income was used', signs of mental illness or alcohol misuse by relatives, and 'any serious difficulties in the parentsâ€™ relationship'.|$|E
5|$|The {{so-called}} NatWest Three â€” Giles Darby, David Bermingham and Gary Mulgrew â€” were extradited to the United States in 2006 {{on charges}} relating to a transaction with Enron Corporation in 2000 {{while they were}} working for Greenwich NatWest. It {{has been argued that}} the alleged crime was committed by British citizens living in the UK against a British company based in London and therefore, any resulting criminal case falls {{under the jurisdiction of the}} English courts. However, the Serious Fraud Office decided not to prosecute due to lack of evidence. There has been criticism that the Americans do not have to produce a prima facie <b>case,</b> <b>or</b> even a reasonable one, to extradite British citizens, whereas no such facility exists to extradite US citizens to the UK. On 28 November 2007 the three admitted one charge of wire fraud after a plea bargain. On 22 February 2008 they were each sentenced to 37 months in prison.|$|E
