5|$|The {{final cost}} of Apollo was {{reported}} to Congress as $25.4 billion in 1973, It took {{up the majority of}} NASA's budget while it was being developed. For example, in 1966 it accounted for about 60 percent of NASA's total $5.2 billion budget. That {{was one of the biggest}} investment of the US in science, research and development, and employed thousands of American scientists.

After the completion of design work and environmental cleanup in 2015, the substation's cost was revised to $210 million because of unexpected soil contamination and the need for newer electrical equipment.|$|E

In anticipation of such a move, local officials and the military proposed extending the Blue and Green Lines to service each base. The proposed extension of the Green Line could cost $100 million per mile ($60 million per kilometer), and a light rail extension to Fort Belvoir was estimated to <b>cost</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> $800 million.

5|$|In Ancient Roman times, tigers {{were kept}} in menageries and amphitheatres to be exhibited, trained and paraded, and were often {{provoked}} to fight humans and exotic beasts. Since the 17th century, tigers, being rare and ferocious, were sought after to keep at European castles as symbols of their owners' power. Tigers became central zoo and circus exhibits in the 18th century: a tiger could <b>cost</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 4,000 francs in France (for comparison, a professor of the Beaux-Arts at Lyons earned only 3,000 francs a year), or up to $3,500 in the United States where a lion cost no more than $1,000.|$|E
5|$|The nearby Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel {{is being}} planned to connect northeastern New Jersey and Long Island, with portals in Brooklyn and in Jersey City, New Jersey. The tunnel is being planned {{as a result}} of {{passenger}} and commuter traffic frequencies being at capacity and precluding freight movements. As early as the 1920s, this tunnel had been planned to cross the entire New York Harbor rather than just the Narrows. As a precursor to the planned project, which could <b>cost</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> $11 billion to build, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) compiled a Tier 1 Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in November 2014.|$|E

5|$|The {{precursor}} wave to Matthew produced heavy rainfall across portions of Venezuela, destroying several homes and leading to eight fatalities. Impacts extended across Central America, especially in Nicaragua where 70 people were killed. Bridges were collapsed, roads were destroyed, communication lines were downed, {{and up to}} 255 communities were affected by the storm there. Similar but less severe damage was observed in Honduras, where four people were killed, and in El Salvador, where one person died. Widespread rainfall totals of 10in (250mm) were recorded across Veracruz, peaking at 16.73in (424.9mm) in Acayucan. The combined impacts of Hurricane Karl and Tropical Storm Matthew in the state <b>cost</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> $8 billion.

5|$|Also {{during this}} time fraternities began to {{purchase}} and construct houses. During the late 1800s fraternities did not have dedicated houses; instead, they inhabited residential areas scattered around grounds, such as Dawson's Row near the Lawn and boarding houses north of the university. In 1908, the university's Board of Visitors first offered a land lease and a $12,000 loan to Kappa Sigma to construct a fraternity house, and many other fraternities followed. Most of these were located {{just north of the}} Rotunda, on Rugby Road, Madison Lane, University Place, and the surrounding streets. Some of these houses <b>cost</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> $20,000 to build, and many drew inspiration from historic UVA buildings or residences of the Old South, using elements of Jeffersonian architecture. Two houses were even styled to closely resemble famous buildings in the area, with Zeta Psi's house modeled after Monticello and Farmington, and Phi Kappa Psi's house modeled after Carr's Hill. By 1916 most fraternities had built, purchased, or rented a house for their members.|$|E
5|$|Illegal {{trade routes}} {{are known to}} exist from Cambodia, to Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, with much of this trade destined for China. Surveys from 1998 and 1999 show that 80 to 90 animals were {{imported}} from Vietnam though Hekou Port into Yunnan province, making it the most commonly recorded animal in the surveys. China is the primary destination of most Vietnamese slow lorises, although they are also smuggled to other countries, including Taiwan. In one noted incident, 102 animals were confiscated during transit to Ho Chi Minh City in August 1993; of these, only four survived. Pygmy lorises may <b>cost</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> US$400 on the Taiwanese pet market. In the USA, occasionally, pygmy lorises smuggled from Vietnam have been confiscated. The Endangered Primate Rescue Centre reports that the pygmy slow loris is the most often rescued species, which reflects their abundance in trade. In Europe, illegal purchases have been reported from Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, and Moscow.|$|E
