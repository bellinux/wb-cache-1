5|$|The {{first floor}} of the {{building}} was built as a grand 1,200-seat auditorium with a proscenium stage, and meeting rooms dedicated to student organizations. The second floor consisted of a U-shaped balcony and the Old Council Room, a gathering space for smaller organizations. The Old Council Room was repainted in 1945 as part of a minor renovation of the building that also included the opening of a student eatery called The Hoot on the west side. The ceiling was made from decorated plaster and dentils evoked the exterior neoclassical architectural style. The basement housed several offices and later a bicycle exchange, used bookshop, and student storage space. After the 1973 renovation, dishwashing equipment for the ACDC was housed upstairs, along with staff offices. The 2003 renovation saw the removal of this dishwashing equipment; instead, the second upstairs was repurposed as a multifunctional student space, in line with the original intentions for the building. The second story—called UpC—is now an open space capable of seating 600 people when <b>chairs</b> <b>are</b> added; it also features multimedia equipment and a third-floor mezzanine that, until 2015, housed the UpC Cafe.|$|E
5|$|The CoE mistakenly {{believed}} that the waters of Beaver Lake would cover {{the area of the}} large hotels, so those parcels were added to the land they purchased for the project. Dallas Barrack, who owned Oklahoma Row, felt that he had been treated poorly and had received much less than his property was worth. The CoE held a sealed-bid auction and J. G. Gladdens purchased what was left of Missouri and Oklahoma Rows. He planned to move the remnants of Oklahoma Row out of the path of the rising lake waters. In order to do this, it was first necessary to remove the log portion or shell of the hotel. The original windows and doors were dismantled for the move and later reinstalled. The fireplaces, as well as all of the major stonework were later torn down. Also sold at auction were two massive concrete chairs that had been {{at the base of the}} amphitheater. They were bought by Mr. and Mrs. Ulis Rose of Rogers and were used to decorate the lawns of their Town and Country restaurant and motel. The <b>chairs</b> <b>are</b> still located in Rogers; however, they now sit unceremoniously in Frisco Park without any plaque or marker indicating their significance. The concrete couch was left in place at the base of the amphitheater, because no one wanted to try to move it.|$|E

25|$|A {{chair is}} a piece of {{furniture}} with a raised surface supported by legs, commonly used to seat a single person. <b>Chairs</b> <b>are</b> supported most often by four legs and have a back; however, a chair can have three legs or can have a different shape. <b>Chairs</b> <b>are</b> made {{of a wide variety of}} materials, ranging from wood to metal to synthetic material (e.g. plastic), and they may be padded or upholstered in various colors and fabrics, either just on the seat (as with some dining room chairs) or on the entire chair. <b>Chairs</b> <b>are</b> used in a number of rooms in homes (e.g. in living rooms, dining rooms, and dens), in schools and offices (with desks), and in various other workplaces.|$|E

50|$|The Garden Egg <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by Peter Ghyczy in 1968. It was manufactured by Reuter Products. The <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> designed for both {{indoor and outdoor}} use, although as a design icon and collectable it is rarely used outdoors. The chair lid lifts and closes, and when closed is theoretically waterproof. The Egg <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> re-introduced in 2001 by Ghyczy Novo. The Garden Egg <b>Chair</b> <b>is</b> known by several names; “seftenberger ei, pod chair, l’œuf en garden(egg)chair.” Elastogran/Reuter produced the plastic polyurethane. Ghyczy's job was to start a design centre {{in order to show}} industrial customers polyurethane's potential. The Garden Egg <b>Chair</b> <b>is</b> one of the first chairs made with polyurethane. For a long time, the <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> produced by the East German company VEB-Synthese-Werk, but since 1998, it has been produced in the Netherlands.|$|R

60|$|I {{have endured}} tortures of various sorts, but when I reflect upon {{them in the}} {{quietness}} of these my last days, I am confident that no other torture was quite the equal of that chair torture. By my body that stout <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> battered out of any semblance of a <b>chair.</b> Another <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> brought, and in time that <b>chair</b> <b>was</b> demolished. But more <b>chairs</b> <b>were</b> brought, and the eternal questioning about the dynamite went on.|$|R

25|$|Field of Empty Chairs: 168 empty chairs hand-crafted from glass, bronze, {{and stone}} {{represent}} {{those who lost}} their lives, with a name etched in the glass base of each. They sit on {{the site where the}} Murrah Building once stood. The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims' families. The <b>chairs</b> <b>are</b> arranged in nine rows to symbolize the nine floors of the building; each person's chair is on the row (or the floor) on which the person worked or was located when the bomb went off. The <b>chairs</b> <b>are</b> also grouped according to the blast pattern, with the most chairs nearest the most heavily damaged portion of the building. The westernmost column of five chairs represents the five people who died but were not in the Murrah Building (two in the Water Resources Board building, one in the Athenian Building, one outside near the building, and one rescuer). The 19 smaller chairs represent the children killed in the bombing. Three unborn children died along with their mothers, and they are listed on their mothers' chairs beneath their mothers' names.|$|E

25|$|Two bureaucrats, first Bertrand (A) {{and then}} Morvan (B) enter a sixth floor {{apartment}} where they find Croker (C) standing centre stage {{in front of}} an open window {{with his back to the}} audience, clearly on the point of throwing himself out of it. A pair of identical tables, lamps and <b>chairs</b> <b>are</b> there waiting for them, stage left and stage right. The set is therefore symmetrical. The name Croker is an obvious pun on the euphemism, ‘to croak’ i.e. to die, and a name to which Beckett has shown some attachment.|$|E
25|$|National {{and local}} {{government}} regulations require a minimum width for aisles in various building types. Regulatory agencies frequently inspect buildings, vehicles, etc., to enforce regulations requiring that aisles not be restricted. Inspectors have imposed fines for blocking or restricting passage when boxes or folding <b>chairs</b> <b>are</b> stored in aisles, for example. Insurance companies frequently have safety inspectors to examine the premises, both to determine whether insureds are complying with the insurer's requirements for coverage and to look for any practices {{that could lead to}} injury or property damage, including restricting passage in aisles.|$|E
25|$|Each Senate {{committee}} and subcommittee {{is led by}} a chair (usually {{a member of the}} majority party). Formerly, committee chairs were determined purely by seniority; as a result, several elderly senators continued to serve as chair despite severe physical infirmity or even senility. Committee <b>chairs</b> <b>are</b> elected, but, in practice, seniority is rarely bypassed. The chairs hold extensive powers: they control the committee's agenda, and so decide how much, if any, time to devote to the consideration of a bill; they act with the power of the committee in disapproving or delaying a bill or a nomination by the president; they manage {{on the floor of the}} full Senate the consideration of those bills the committee reports. This last role was particularly important in mid-century, when floor amendments were thought not to be collegial. They also have considerable influence: senators who cooperate with their committee <b>chairs</b> <b>are</b> likely to accomplish more good for their states than those who do not. The Senate rules and customs were reformed in the twentieth century, largely in the 1970s. Committee chairmen have less power and are generally more moderate and collegial in exercising it, than they were before reform. The second-highest member, the spokesperson on the committee for the minority party, is known in most cases as the ranking member. In the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Select Committee on Ethics, however, the senior minority member is known as the vice chair.|$|E

25|$|The lady chapel was {{furnished}} {{in memory}} of Uvedale and Cecily Lambert by their son Uvedale Lambert. The work was designed by Hugh Ray Easton of Cambridge, executed by Mr C Hammond of Kew and dedicated by The Venerable Charles Lambert on All Saints' Day, 2 November 1933. The cedar wood used was given by the Rev Gerard Hoare, Rector of Godstone, and came from one large tree blown down in the churchyard there in 1927. The sanctuary <b>chairs</b> <b>are</b> also made from it. The stained glass window in the lady chapel is a memorial to Peter Flint, churchwarden at the Barn Church for 20 years. It was designed in 1999 by his daughter, Christine Flint Sato.|$|E
25|$|The Congressional Progressive Caucus is a caucus of {{progressive}} Democrats, {{and is the}} single largest Democratic caucus in the House of Representatives.

Today, no Democratic Senators belong to the Progressive Caucus; however, Independent Senator Bernie Sanders is a member.|$|E
25|$|Cross used in Marthoma Church Chancel {{particularly}} {{at the center of}} the Altar is the Easter Cross. In Marthoma worship practice the visual Sign of the Cross is used many times. When the Priest gives the blessing he performs the sign of the cross; the worshipers, as a sign of accepting the blessing also reciprocates blessing oneself. The same is done at the time of the declaration of the Trinity and also at the time of indication of the Cross. Generally iconostases, pictures or statues of saints are not kept in Marthoma churches. Until the middle of the 20th century, all worshipers were seated on a mat spread on the floor. Children occupy the first rows and behind them on right side females and towards left males are seated. A narrow space between left and right is demarcated with a red carpet starting from the main door signifying that the church is sharing the worship space of heaven and joining the communion. Now many churches provide chairs or benches. During the Passion week services, <b>chairs</b> <b>are</b> removed, to facilitate worshiping according to their ancient custom, which includes prostrating a number of times. Everyone including clergy and the laity, who take part in the worship, faces east for the service.|$|E
