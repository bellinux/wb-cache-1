40|$|The Arctic {{climate is}} changing; {{temperature}} {{changes in the}} Arctic are greater than at midlatitudes, and changing atmospheric conditions influence Arctic mixed-phase clouds, which are important for the Arctic surface energy budget. These low-level clouds are frequently observed across the Arctic. They impact the turbulent and radiative heating of the open water, snow, and sea-ice-covered surfaces and influence the boundary layer structure. Therefore the processes that affect mixed-phase cloud life cycles are extremely important, yet relatively poorly understood. In this study, we present sensitivity studies using semi-idealized large eddy simulations (LESs) to identify processes contributing to the dissipation of Arctic mixed-phase clouds. We found that one potential main contributor to the dissipation of an observed Arctic mixed-phase cloud, during the Arctic Summer Cloud Ocean Study (ASCOS) field campaign, was a low cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) of about 2  cm − 3. Introducing a high ice crystal concentration of 10  L − 1 also resulted in <b>cloud</b> <b>dissipation,</b> but such high ice crystal concentrations were deemed unlikely for the present case.

At the operational depths of 1. 55 – 15. 9 times the significant wave height Hs, and in steady winds of about 11. 6 m s? 1 when the wave age is 11. 7 – 17. 2, dissipation {{is found to be}} lognormally distributed with a law-of-the-wall variation with depth and friction velocity. Breaking waves, leaving clouds of bubbles in the water, are detected ahead of the Autosub by a forward-pointing sidescan sonar, and the dissipation is measured when the clouds are subsequently reached. Bands of bubbles resulting from the presence of Langmuir circulation are identified by a semiobjective method that seeks continuity of band structure recognized by both forward- and sideways-pointing sidescan sonars. The times at which bands are crossed are determined and are used to relate dissipation rates and other measured parameters to the location of Langmuir bands. Shear-induced “temperature ramps” are identified with large horizontal temperature gradients. The turbulence measurements are consequently related to breaking waves, the bubble clouds, Langmuir circulation, and temperature ramps, and therefore to the principal processes of mixing in the near-surface layer of the ocean, all of which are found to have associated patterns of turbulent dissipation rates. A large proportion of the highest values of dissipation rate occur within bubble <b>clouds.</b> <b>Dissipation</b> is enhanced in the convergence region of Langmuir circulation at depths to about 10 m, and on the colder, bubble containing, side of temperature ramps associated with water advected downward from near the surface.

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} the {{formation}} of a disk galaxy from a spherical, rotating, hot, gaseous envelope is solved by the means of a 2 -D hydrodynamic code. Thermal instability and formation of clouds, cloud evaporation due to the hot surroundings and ram pressure, dynamical interaction between the gas and the <b>clouds,</b> energy <b>dissipation</b> by cloud-cloud collisions and radiation cooling of the intercloud gas are taken into account. Thermal conductivity is ignored. The most important of the results obtained are as follows: 1. At the time {{of the formation of}} the disk, the phase transitions lead to angular momentum transfer from the outer to the inner regions. If the temperature initially is independent of the distance from the center, the most important factor of the angular momentum transfer is the evaporation of the clouds. If initially the temperature is smaller at the outer regions, the most important factor of the angular momentum transfer is cloud-cloud collisions. 2. The observed exponential profiles can be understood as the result of angular momentum transfer due to the viscosity, which becomes important after the violent stage of the formation of the gaseous disk. 3. The model can explain the origin of the HI clouds located at large distances from the axis of spiral galaxies. Owing to the complicated mathematics, the gas–cloud dynamical interactions and the numerical method are presented only in the on-line version of the paper.

40|$|The Tibet Plateau {{significantly}} {{affects the}} initiation {{and development of}} heavy rainfall and severe storms in China, just as the Rocky Mountains influence local severe storms in the United States. The study shows that the heavy rainfall in the Plateau area is usually preceded by a high growth rate of the convective clouds, followed by a rapid collapse of the cloud top. The study also shows that {{the tops of the}} convective clouds associated with heavy rainfall over the Plateau usually lie between the altitude of the two tropopauses which exist over the Plateau.

40|$|We {{perform a}} model intercomparison of summertime high Arctic (>  80  N) clouds {{observed}} during the 2008 Arctic Summer Cloud Ocean Study (ASCOS) campaign, when observed cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations fell below 1  cm − 3. Previous analyses {{have suggested that}} at these low CCN concentrations the liquid water content (LWC) and radiative properties of the clouds are determined primarily by the CCN concentrations, conditions that have previously {{been referred to as}} the tenuous cloud regime. The intercomparison includes results from three large eddy simulation models (UCLALES-SALSA, COSMO-LES, and MIMICA) and three numerical weather prediction models (COSMO-NWP, WRF, and UM-CASIM). We test the sensitivities of the model results to different treatments of cloud droplet activation, including prescribed cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC) and diagnostic CCN activation based on either fixed aerosol concentrations or prognostic aerosol with in-cloud processing. There remains considerable diversity even in experiments with prescribed CDNCs and prescribed ice crystal number concentrations (ICNC). The sensitivity of mixed-phase Arctic cloud properties to changes in CDNC depends on the representation of the cloud droplet size distribution within each model, which impacts on autoconversion rates. Our results therefore suggest that properly estimating aerosol–cloud interactions requires an appropriate treatment of the cloud droplet size distribution within models, as well as in-situ observations of hydrometeor size distributions to constrain them. The results strongly support the hypothesis that the liquid water content of these clouds is CCN-limited. For the observed meteorological conditions, the cloud generally did not collapse when the CCN concentration was held constant at the relatively high CCN concentrations measured during the cloudy period, but the cloud thins or collapses as the CCN concentration is reduced. The CCN concentration at which collapse occurs varies substantially between models. Only one model predicts complete dissipation of the cloud due to glaciation, and this occurs only for the largest prescribed ICNC tested in this study. Global and regional models with either prescribed CDNCs or prescribed aerosol concentrations would not reproduce these dissipation events. Additionally, future increases in Arctic aerosol concentrations would be expected to decrease the frequency of occurrence of such <b>cloud</b> <b>dissipation</b> events, with implications for the radiative balance at the surface. Our results also show that cooling of the sea-ice surface following <b>cloud</b> <b>dissipation</b> increases atmospheric stability near the surface, further suppressing cloud formation. Therefore, this suggests that linkages between aerosol and clouds, as well as linkages between clouds, surface temperatures and atmospheric stability need to be considered for weather and climate predictions in this region...|$|E
40|$|Propagation of a quasi-neutral plasma beam or cloud {{across a}} {{magnetic}} field is considered for the case where the transverse dimension of the beam or cloud is sufficiently small compared to ion gyroradii. This situation commonly arises for active experiments in near-earth space. Two mechanisms are presented for transverse deflection of a beam or cloud in the -v 0 x B 0 direction where v 0 is the velocity relative to the ambient medium.

The transverse deflection distance is estimated to be a few times the initial transverse dimension of the beam or <b>cloud.</b> <b>Dissipation</b> occurs within a few times the thermal ion transverse crossing time. In the second mechanism, asymmetric charging results from localized accumulation of incident ions from the ambient medium.

Sky imager forecast algorithms usually detect cloud classes in the image.

One method to connect GHI to cloud classes involves the use of a histogram of recently measured clear sky indices to assign a clear sky index/GHI to each cloud class. While this method improves upon choosing static GHI values for each cloud class, this thesis presents a modification which improves the histogram method.

In the present study, amplification and dissipation of magnetic fields in star-forming clouds are investigated under different environments using magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations. We consider various star-forming environments in combination with the metallicity and the ionization strength, and prepare prestellar clouds having two different mass-to-flux ratios.

40|$|Disk {{galaxies are}} very complex systems {{consisting}} of several components like the bulge, the disk and the halo. Additionally, substructures like extended HI disks, thin and thick stellar disks are observed. Contrary to elliptical galaxies, disk galaxies contain a significant mass fraction of gas. It is therefore {{an important question}} how gas physics influences {{the evolution of a}} galaxy, especially in its early state. To address this question, I have presented a threedimensional model for the chemodynamical evolution of galaxies, consisting of a hot and a cold gas phase and stars, embedded in a dark matter halo. The components interact with each other through several processes like star formation, evaporation and condensation, radiation cooling and dissipation, and mass and energy feedback from the stars. In this model, the dynamical, star formation and chemical evolution of the galaxy is followed. This enables comparison to a variety of observable properties, such as metallicity distribution or kinematics of the stars. Using the method of Westera et al. (2002) to calculate colors of the models at different redshifts including absorption, the models can also be directly compared to high redshift observations. The template of the numerical model was the three dimensional version of CoDEx (Samland et al., 1997). I have written the program in the F 90 standard, which allowed for vectorization and partly parallelization of the code. Performance comparisons assure that the program runs very efficiently on different architectures. Samland & Gerhard (2003) note that the poorly known <b>cloud</b> <b>dissipation</b> rate, {{the rate at which the}} cloudy medium can lose energy, is very important for galaxy evolution. It was pointed out in the description of the model that the <b>cloud</b> <b>dissipation</b> rate is not well-determined and may well vary between galaxies. To investigate its effect on disk evolution, I set up a sequence of models, where only the <b>cloud</b> <b>dissipation</b> efficiency was varied. I found that two evolutionary paths for the disk evolution exist in the context of the model, which are summarized below in more detail. The evolutionary path of a galactic disk depends on whether it is the gas disk or the stellar disk which first becomes unstable. The stability analysis was done using the Toomre Q parameter of the cloudy and the stellar phase. When the cold gas cools efficiently and drives the instability, the galactic disk fragments and forms a number of massive clumps. The stellar disk fragments with the gas because of the strong gravity of the clumps, which begin to form stars at a high rate because of their large density. The clumps then spiral to the center of the galaxy in a few dynamical times and merge there to form a central bulge component in a strong starburst. This scenario is similar to that discussed by Noguchi (1999). In this mode of disk evolution, the bulge forms rapidly and early; the unstable region of the disk is completely disrupted, and the disk must be rebuilt by subsequent infall. Because of the starburst origin, many of the bulge stars formed in this way have large [�/Fe] abundance ratios. On the other hand, if the kinetic energy of the cold clouds is dissipated at a lower rate, stars form from the gas in a more quiescent mode, while keeping the kinetic temperature high enough and the gas density low enough to prevent the gas from becoming dynamically unstable. In this case, an instability only sets in at later times, when the surface density of the stellar disk has grown sufficiently high. The system then forms a stellar bar, which channels gas into the center, evolves, and forms a bulge whose stars are the result of a more extended star formation history, i. e., have lower [�/Fe]. This scenario resembles the evolution described by Combes & Sanders (1981), Pfenniger & Norman (1990) and Raha et al. (1991). The comparably long formation time for bars and bulges in this mode and the weakening of the bar through inward gas flow in the still gasrich disks might explain the absence of bars at high redshift (Abraham et al., 1999). This is also consistent with the young age inferred for the Galactic bar (Cole & Weinberg, 2002). An example of a nearby galaxy in which the fragmentation process may be taking place, is the gas-rich, blue starburst galaxy NGC 7673 (Homeier & Gallagher, 1999). At high redshift, chain and multi-clump morphological structures, as well as synchronized colors in clumpy objects, can be well explained by a fragmented disk model. The model suggests that these galaxies are in their formation process and are observed during their relatively short fragmentation phase, with a high SFR, comparable to the model SFR of up to 220 M� y...|$|E

Size distributions were determined with a Royco light-scattering particle counter, a condensation nuclei counter, and a settling tunnel. Two six-stage cascade impactors were used to collect samples for sulfur-compound and chloride analysis. The size distribution data showed a mode in the submicron size range.

The location of the secondary mode is consistent with some of the distributions calculated from theory, but the observed concentrations of about 1 droplet per cc per p of radius at the secondary mode are substantially less than calculated. One possible reason involves the mixed chemical composition of the nuclei; another is the high cooling rates used for the calculations. The observations show organic material to be present and a nonuni-formity in the distribution of sulfur compounds and chlorides over the droplet spectrum. The average ratio of sulfur to chloride varies from about 4 for T = 0. 2 p to about 0. 4 for r = 2 p to about 1. 3 for r = 4 p.

40|$|Observations of {{variability}} can provide valuable {{information about the}} processes of <b>cloud</b> formation and <b>dissipation</b> in brown dwarf atmospheres. Here we report {{the results of an}} independent analysis of archival data from the Brown dwarf Atmosphere Monitoring (BAM) program. Time series data for 14 L and T dwarfs reported to be significantly variable over timescales of hours were analyzed. We confirm large-amplitude variability (amplitudes > 2 %) for 4 / 13 targets and place upper limits of 0. 7 %- 1. 6 % on variability in the remaining sample. For two targets we find evidence of weak variability at amplitudes of 1. 3 % and 1. 6 %. Based on our revised classification of variable objects in the BAM study, we find strong variability outside the L/T transition to be rare at near infrared wavelengths. From a combined sample of 81 L 0 -T 9 dwarfs from the revised BAM sample and the variability survey of Radigan et al. we infer an overall observed frequency for large-amplitude variability outside the L/T transition of 3. 2 _- 1. 8 ^+ 2. 8 %, in contrast to 24 ^+ 11 _- 9 % for L 9 -T 3. 5 spectral types. We conclude that while strong variability {{is not limited to the}} L/T transition, it occurs more frequently in this spectral type range, indicative of larger or more highly contrasting cloud features at these spectral types.

40|$|Water {{is a key}} {{constituent}} {{of every}} planetary environment, and on Venus its abundance, distribution and temporal behaviour are crucial for understanding greenhouse warming, <b>cloud</b> formation and <b>dissipation,</b> volcanism, and atmospheric evolution. Many telescopic and spacecraft-based observations of atmospheric water vapour on Venus have been made, but are inconclusive about {{its role as a}} component of the current climate system on the planet. The data suggest that H 2 O may be well mixed in the lower atmosphere, but highly variable in and near the cloud layers, and probably also at the thermospheric levels where dissociation and loss occur. The details of the middle atmosphere variability, how significant it is, and the processes responsible, remain controversial. In particular, the Pioneer Venus Infrared Radiometer found a large 'wet patch', a localized region where the water vapour mixing ratio is generally enhanced by one to two orders of magnitude over the global mean, occurring at low latitudes in the mid-afternoon, that has not been confirmed by other observations. If it is real, the presently unknown mechanism that produces it may be {{an important part of the}} water cycle in the Venusian atmosphere. Here we reconsider this problem, and some of the possible processes that may be involved, prior to the expected acquisition of relevant new data by Venus Express and the Venus Climate Orbiter.

40|$|Low-mass stars 0. 1 ~< M ~< 1 Msun) in OB {{associations}} {{are key to}} addressing {{some of the most}} fundamental problems in star formation. The low-mass stellar populations of OB associations provide a snapshot of the fossil star-formation record of giant molecular cloud complexes. Large scale surveys have identified hundreds of members of nearby OB associations, and revealed that low-mass stars exist wherever high-mass stars have recently formed. The spatial distribution of low-mass members of OB associations demonstrate the existence of significant substructure ("subgroups"). This "discretized" sequence of stellar groups is consistent with an origin in short-lived parent molecular clouds within a Giant Molecular Cloud Complex. The low-mass population in each subgroup within an OB association exhibits little evidence for significant age spreads on time scales of ~ 10 Myr or greater, in agreement with a scenario of rapid star formation and <b>cloud</b> <b>dissipation.</b> The Initial Mass Function (IMF) of the stellar populations in OB associations in the mass range 0. 1 ~< M ~< 1 Msun is largely consistent with the field IMF, and most low-mass pre-main sequence stars in the solar vicinity are in OB associations. These findings agree with early suggestions that the majority of stars in the Galaxy were born in OB associations. The most recent work further suggests that a significant fraction of the stellar population may have their origin in the more spread out regions of OB associations, instead of all being born in dense clusters.

40|$|Large fine mode (sub-micron radius) {{dominated}} aerosols in size distributions {{retrieved from}} AERONET {{have been observed}} after fog or low-altitude <b>cloud</b> <b>dissipation</b> events. These column-integrated size distributions have been obtained at several sites in many regions of the world, typically after evaporation of low altitude cloud such as stratocumulus or fog. Retrievals with cloud processed aerosol are sometimes bimodal in the accumulation mode with the larger size mode often approx. 0. 4 - 0. 5 microns radius (volume distribution); the smaller mode typically approx. 0. 12 to aprrox. 0. 20 microns may be interstitial aerosol that were not modified by incorporation in droplets and/or aerosol that are less hygroscopic in nature. Bimodal accumulation mode size distributions have often been observed from in situ measurements of aerosols that have interacted with clouds, and AERONET size distribution retrievals made after dissipation of cloud or fog are in good agreement with particle sizes measured by in situ techniques for cloud-processed aerosols. Aerosols of this type and large size range (in lower concentrations) may also be formed by cloud processing in partly cloudy conditions and {{may contribute to the}} shoulder of larger size particles in the accumulation mode retrievals, especially in regions where sulfate and other soluble aerosol are a significant component of the total aerosol composition. Observed trends of increasing aerosol optical depth (AOD) as fine mode radius increased suggests higher AOD in the near cloud environment and therefore greater aerosol direct radiative forcing than typically obtained from remote sensing, due to bias towards sampling at low cloud fraction...|$|E
40|$|We examine from a {{theoretical}} viewpoint how the physical parameters of H II regions are controlled both in normal galaxies and in starburst environments. These parameters are the H II region luminosity function, the time-dependent size, the covering fraction of molecular clouds, {{the pressure in}} the ionized gas and the ionization parameter. The factors which control them are the initial mass function of the exciting stars, the cluster mass function, the metallicity and the mean pressure in the surrounding interstellar medium. We investigate {{the sensitivity of the}} H{alpha} luminosity to the IMF, and find that this can translate to about 30 % variation in derived star formation rates. The molecular <b>cloud</b> <b>dissipation</b> timescale is estimated from a case study of M 17 to be {approx} 1 Myr. Based upon H II luminosity function fitting for nearby galaxies, we propose that the cluster mass function has a log-normal form peaking at {approx} 185 M{sub {circle_dot}}. This suggests that the cluster mass function is the continuation of the stellar IMF to higher mass. The pressure in the H II regions is controlled by the mechanical luminosity flux from the central cluster. Since this is closely related to the ionizing photon flux, we show that the ionization parameter is not a free variable, and that the diffuse ionized medium may be composed of many large, faint and old H II regions. Finally, we derive theoretical probability distributions for the ionization parameter as a function of metallicity and compare these to those derived for SDSS galaxies...|$|E
40|$|We analyse {{the results}} of four {{simulations}} of isolated galaxies: two with a rigid spiral potential of fixed pattern speed, but with different degrees of star-formation induced feedback, one with an axisymmetric galactic potential and one with a `live' self-gravitating stellar component. Since we use a Lagrangian method {{we are able to}} select gas that lies within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) at a particular timeframe, and to then study the properties of this gas at earlier and later times. We find that gas which forms GMCs is not typical of the interstellar medium at least 50 Myr before the clouds form and reaches mean densities within an order of magnitude of mean cloud densities by around 10 Myr before. The gas in GMCs takes at least 50 Myr to return to typical ISM gas after dispersal by stellar feedback, and in some cases the gas is never fully recycled. We also present a study of the two-dimensional, vertically-averaged velocity fields within the ISM. We show that the velocity fields corresponding to the shortest timescales (that is, those timescales closest to the immediate formation and <b>dissipation</b> of the <b>clouds)</b> can be readily understood in terms of the various <b>cloud</b> formation and <b>dissipation</b> mechanisms. Properties of the flow patterns can be used to distinguish the processes which drive converging flows (e. g. spiral shocks, supernovae) and thus molecular cloud formation, and we note that such properties may be detectable with future observations of nearby galaxies.

40|$|In {{the quest}} for {{realistic}} rendering of outdoor scenes, clouds form a crucial component. The sky is a prominent feature for many such scenes, and seldom is the air devoid of clouds. Their great variety in shape, size and color poses a difficult problem {{in the pursuit of}} convincing visualization. Additionally, the complexity of light behavior in participating media like clouds, as well as their sheer size, often cause photo-realistic approaches to have exceedingly high computational costs. This thesis presents a method for rendering realistic, animated cumuliform clouds through a phenomenological approach. Taking advantage of the parallel processing power of the GPU, the cloud appearance is computed per pixel, resulting in real-time full-screen visualization even on low-end GPU's. The pixel color is determined by three components. First, the opacity is computed based on a cloud mesh consisting of a set of ellipsoids, upon which a fractal noise texture is superimposed to generate detailed cloud features. Second, the single scattering component is analytically calculated using the same triangle mesh and a discretized Mie phase function. Finally, the multiple scattering component is obtained from a phenomenological model using trigonometric and logarithmic formulas with coefficients based on the view and sun angles and the cloud thickness at the current pixel. The parameters for this model are {{based on the work of}} Bouthors et al., who studied light transport in plane-parallel slabs. We apply this model in a more robust manner to find the best-fitting plane-parallel slab, providing for a better and faster alternative to the original approach. The clouds are animated at no extra cost by translating them across the scene, which creates a simulation of turbulence, due to the fact that the noise texture is sampled by the world coordinates of a pixel. Additionally, <b>cloud</b> formation and <b>dissipation</b> is simulated by modifying the water droplet density...|$|R
40|$|The {{residence}} time of bacterial {{cells in the}} atmosphere is predictable by numerical models. However, estimations of their aerial dispersion as living entities are limited {{by a lack of}} information concerning survival rates and behavior in relation to atmospheric water. Here we investigate the viability and ice nucleation (IN) activity of typical atmospheric ice nucleation active bacteria (Pseudomonas syringae and P. fluorescens) when airborne in a cloud simulation chamber (AIDA, Karlsruhe, Germany). Cell suspensions were sprayed into the chamber and aerosol samples were collected by impingement at designated times over a total duration of up to 18 h, and at some occasions after <b>dissipation</b> of a <b>cloud</b> formed by depressurization. Aerosol concentration was monitored simultaneously by online instruments. The cultivability of airborne cells decreased exponentially over time with a half-life time of 250 ± 30 min (about 3. 5 to 4. 5 h). In contrast, IN activity remained unchanged for several hours after aerosolization, demonstrating that IN activity was maintained after cell death. Interestingly, the relative abundance of IN active cells still airborne in the chamber was strongly decreased after <b>cloud</b> formation and <b>dissipation.</b> This illustrates the preferential precipitation of IN active cells by wet processes. Our results indicate that from 10 6 cells aerosolized from a surface, one would survive the average duration of its atmospheric journey estimated at 3. 4 days. Statistically, this corresponds to the emission of 1 cell that achieves dissemination every ~ 33 min m − 2 of cultivated crops fields, a strong source of airborne bacteria. Based on the observed survival rates, depending on wind speed, the trajectory endpoint could be situated several hundreds to thousands of kilometers from the emission source. These results should improve the representation of the aerial dissemination of bacteria in numeric models...|$|R
