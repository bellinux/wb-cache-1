40|$|Neuroblastoma is {{the most}} common extra-cranial solid {{childhood}} cancer; it arises from neural crest-derived cells of the sympathetic nervous system. The anomalous regulation of embryonic developmental pathways like Delta-Notch and Wnt has been implicated in aberrant cell growth and differentiation in many (childhood) tumours. We have previously found regulation of Delta-Notch pathway genes by the MSX 1 neural crest development gene in a neuroblastoma cell line, and significant correlations between these genes in neuroblastic tumours. However, a clear role for the Wnt pathway in neuroblastic tumours has not yet been determined. We now analyze the complete spectrum of genes regulated by inducible expression of MSX 1 in the SJNB 8 neuroblastoma cell line using Affymetrix expression profiling. We show that MSX 1 induces the expression of four different Wnt pathway inhibitor genes: Dickkopf 1 - 3 (DKK 1 - 3) and secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP 1), and provide evidence that high expression of two of these genes correlates with good prognosis. We were able to demonstrate that both the canonical Wnt 3 and the alternative Wnt 5 A ligands are highly expressed in neuroblastic tumours and cell lines, and specifically activate the DVL 3 Wnt <b>co-receptor</b> <b>protein</b> in SJNB 8 neuroblastoma cells. These results suggest involvement of MSX 1 in Wnt signalling and demonstrate activity of the more upstream Wnt pathway in neuroblastic cells. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hedgehog {{signaling}} {{plays an}} important role in embryonic development, organogenesis and cancer. In the adult liver, Hedgehog signaling in non-parenchymal cells has been found to play a role in certain disease states such as fibrosis and cirrhosis. However, whether the Hedgehog pathway is active in mature healthy hepatocytes and is of significance to liver function are controversial. Findings: Two types of mice with distinct conditional hepatic deletion of the Smoothened gene, an essential <b>co-receptor</b> <b>protein</b> of the Hedgehog pathway, were generated for investigating the role of Hedgehog signaling in mature hepatocytes. The knockout animals (KO) were inconspicuous and healthy with no changes in serum transaminases, but showed a slower weight gain. The liver was smaller, but presented a normal architecture and cellular composition. By quantitative RT-PCR the downregulation of the expression of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and the Gli 3 transcription factor could be demonstrated in healthy mature hepatocytes from these mice, whereas Patched 1 was upregulated. Strong alterations in gene expression were also observed for the IGF axis. While expression of Igf 1 was downregulated, that of Igfbp 1 was upregulated in the livers of both genders. Corresponding changes in the serum levels of both proteins could be detected by ELISA. By activating and inhibiting the transcriptional output of Hedgehog signaling in cultured hepatocytes through siRNAs against Ptch 1 and Gli 3, respectively, in combination with a ChIP assay evidence was collected indicating that Igf 1 expression is directl...|$|E
40|$|The {{phytohormone}} {{abscisic acid}} (ABA) {{is an essential}} part of the plant response to abiotic stressors such as drought. Upon the perception of ABA, pyrabactin resistance (PYR) /PYR 1 -like (PYL) /regulatory components of ABA receptor (RCAR) proteins interact with <b>co-receptor</b> <b>protein</b> phosphatase type 2 Cs to permit activation Snf 1 -related protein kinase 2 (SnRK 2) kinases, which switch on ABA signaling by phosphorylating various target proteins. Thus, SnRK 2 kinases are central regulators of ABA signaling. However, the mechanisms that regulate SnRK 2 degradation remain elusive. Here, we show that SnRK 2. 3 is degradated by 26 S proteasome system and ABA promotes its degradation. We found that SnRK 2. 3 interacts with AtPP 2 -B 11 directly. AtPP 2 -B 11 is an F-box protein that is part of a SKP 1 /Cullin/F-box E 3 ubiquitin ligase complex that negatively regulates plant responses to ABA by specifically promoting the degradation of SnRK 2. 3. AtPP 2 -B 11 was induced by ABA, and the knockdown of AtPP 2 -B 11 expression markedly increased the ABA sensitivity of plants during seed germination and postgerminative development. Overexpression of AtPP 2 -B 11 does not affect ABA sensitivity, but inhibits the ABA hypersensitive phenotypes of SnRK 2. 3 overexpression lines. These results reveal a novel mechanism through which AtPP 2 -B 11 specifically degrades SnRK 2. 3 to attenuate ABA signaling and the abiotic stress response in Arabidopsis...|$|E

TLR 4 -mediated innate immune signaling, which is {{implicated in the}} pathogenesis {{of a variety of}} human diseases, including sepsis syndrome. The antagonistic activity of a series of novel synthetic tetraacylated bis-phosphorylated glycolipids based on the GlcN(11) GlcN scaffold was assessed in human monocytic macrophage-like cell line THP- 1, dendritic cells and human epithelial cells. Two compounds were shown to inhibit efficiently the LPS-induced inflammatory signaling by down-regulation of the expression of TNF-, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10 and IL- 12 to background levels. The binding of the tetraacylated by (R) - 3 -hydroxy-fatty acids (2 xC(12,) 2 xC(14)), 4, 4 -bisphosphorylated GlcN(11) GlcN-based lipid A mimetic DA 193 to human MD- 2 was calculated to be 20 -fold stronger than that of Escherichia coli lipid A. Potent antagonistic activity was related to a specific molecular shape induced by the,(11) -diglucosamine backbone. Co-planar' relative arrangement of the GlcN rings was inflicted by the double exo-anomeric conformation around both glycosidic torsions in the rigid,(11) linkage, which was ascertained using NOESY NMR experiments and confirmed by molecular dynamics simulation. In contrast to the native lipid A ligands, the binding affinity of GlcN(11) GlcN-based lipid A mimetics to human MD- 2 was independent on the orientation of the diglucosamine backbone of the synthetic antagonist within the binding pocket of hMD- 2 (rotation by 180 degrees) allowing for two equally efficient binding modes as shown by molecular dynamics simulation...|$|E

A pro-inflammatory signaling cascade is initiated upon binding of membrane-associated portion of LPS, a glycophospholipid Lipid A, by a <b>co-receptor</b> <b>protein</b> MD- 2, which results in a protective host innate immune response. However, activation of TLR 4 signaling by LPS may lead to the dysregulated immune response resulting in a variety of inflammatory conditions including sepsis syndrome. Understanding of structural requirements for Lipid A endotoxicity would ensure the development of effective anti-inflammatory medications. Herein we report on design, synthesis and biological activities of a series of conformationally confined Lipid A mimetics based on β,α-trehalose-type scaffold. Replacement of the flexible three-bond β(1 → 6) linkage in diglucosamine backbone of Lipid A by a two-bond β,α(1 ↔ 1) glycosidic linkage afforded novel potent TLR 4 antagonists. Synthetic tetraacylated bisphosphorylated Lipid A mimetics based on a β-GlcN(1 ↔ 1) α-GlcN scaffold selectively block the LPS binding site on both human and murine MD- 2 and completely abolish lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory signaling, thereby serving as antisepsis drug candidates. In contrast to their natural counterpart lipid IVa, conformationally constrained Lipid A mimetics do not activate mouse TLR 4. The structural basis for high antagonistic activity of novel Lipid A mimetics was confirmed by molecular dynamics simulation. Our findings suggest that besides the chemical structure, also the three-dimensional arrangement of the diglucosamine backbone of MD- 2 -bound Lipid A determines endotoxic effects on TLR 4...|$|E
40|$|Flying insects have {{developed}} a remarkably sensitive olfactory system to detect faint and turbulent odor traces. This ability {{is linked to the}} olfactory receptors class of odorant receptors (ORs), occurring exclusively in winged insects. ORs form heteromeric complexes of an odorant specific receptor protein (OrX) and a highly conserved <b>co-receptor</b> <b>protein</b> (Orco). The ORs form ligand gated ion channels that are tuned by intracellular signaling systems. Repetitive subthreshold odor stimulation of olfactory sensory neurons sensitizes insect ORs. This OR sensitization process requires Orco activity. In the present study we first asked whether OR sensitization can be monitored with heterologously expressed OR proteins. Using electrophysiological and calcium imaging methods we demonstrate that D. melanogaster OR proteins expressed in CHO cells show sensitization upon repeated weak stimulation. This was found for OR channels formed by Orco as well as by Or 22 a or Or 56 a and Orco. Moreover, we show that inhibition of calmodulin (CaM) action on OR proteins, expressed in CHO cells, abolishes any sensitization. Finally, we investigated the sensitization phenomenon using an ex vivo preparation of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing Or 22 a inside the fly’s antenna. Using calcium imaging, we observed sensitization in the dendrites {{as well as in the}} soma. Inhibition of calmodulin with W 7 disrupted the sensitization within the outer dendritic shaft, whereas the sensitization remained in the other OSN compartments. Taken together, our results suggest that CaM action is involved in sensitizing the OR complex and that this mechanisms accounts for the sensitization in the outer dendrites, whereas further mechanisms contribute to the sensitization observed in the other OSN compartments. The use of heterologously expressed OR proteins appears to be suitable for further investigations on the mechanistic basis of OR sensitization, while investigations on native neurons are required to study the presently unknown additional mechanisms involved in OSN sensitization...|$|E

These structures could hold the secret behind the exceptional sensitivity of T-Cells in distinguishing single triggering ‘agonist’ peptides against a background of thousands. We have developed a biophysical approach based on magnetic tweezers that allows us to study the players involved in these receptor clusters and their dynamics. We use antibody functionalized magnetic beads to target CD 3, a subunit of the TCR Complex to induce TCR clustering. Using magnetic tweezers, we move the beads along the cell membrane and simultaneously measure trafficking of <b>co-receptors</b> and <b>proteins</b> involved in the complex using confocal fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We study co-receptor CD 6, which is considered a co-stimulator for cell activation during cluster formation. Our findings suggest that while CD 6 is not physically associated with TCR complex, it gets recruited into the TCR clusters. There it is partially immobilized and moves along as clusters are displaced. The diffusion coefficient of CD 6 is higher in bead-stimulated cells, whereas CD 6 outside clusters diffuse faster than those within clusters. We are also downscaling this method to induce formation of receptor nanoclusters, in order to explore the effects of physical receptor oligomerization on the activity of TCR and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors...|$|R

The expression of sortilin is not confined to the nervous system but sortilin is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues. Sortilin has multiple roles in the cell as a receptor or a <b>co-receptor,</b> in <b>protein</b> transport of many interacting partners to the plasma membrane, to the endocytic pathway and to the lysosomes for protein degradation.

In addition, some studies have highlighted that the extracellular domain of sortilin is shedded into the culture media by an unknown mechanism. Sortilin can be released in exosomes and appears to control some mechanisms of exosome biogenesis. In lung cancer cells, sortilin can associate with two receptor tyrosine kinase receptors called the TES complex found in exosomes. Exosomes carrying the TES complex can convey a microenvironment control through the activation of ErbB signaling pathways and the release of angiogenic factors.

We have previously reported its stimulatory effect on adiponectin secretion. However, serum FGF 21 is paradoxically elevated in obesity and high FGF 21 levels predict incident type 2 diabetes, suggesting that FGF 21 resistance enhances {{the development of}} obesity-related type 2 diabetes. Here we sought to confirm the presence of FGF 21 resistance in the adipose tissues of obese/overweight humans and investigate for the underlying mechanism. The expression levels of FGFR 1, the receptor for FGF 21, and β-klotho, its <b>co-receptor</b> <b>protein,</b> and miR- 34 a, were measured in visceral adipose tissues (VAT) collected during surgery from 24 overweight/obese (BMI > 23) Chinese women and 29 age- and sex-matched lean controls. To elucidate the effect of increased miR- 34 a on the expression of β-klotho, FGFR 1 and adiponectin, 3 T 3 -L 1 pre-adipocytes were infected with lentiviral vector expressing miR- 34 a, before differentiation into mature adipocytes. Obese/overweight subjects had raised serum FGF 21, reduced serum adiponectin, reduced VAT expressions of FGFR 1 (all p< 0. 01) and β-klotho (p< 0. 05), but increased VAT expression of miR- 34 a (p< 0. 05), by RT-PCR. VAT FGFR 1 and β-klotho expressions correlated inversely with the HOMA-IR insulin resistance index (both p< 0. 05), but positively with serum adiponectin (both p< 0. 01). On the other hand, VAT miR- 34 a expression correlated inversely with that of β-klotho, FGFR 1 and adiponectin (all p< 0. 01), but positively with HOMA-IR (p< 0. 05). Lentivirus-mediated 5 -fold increase in adipocyte miR- 34 a expression was accompanied by reduced β-klotho (p< 0. 01), FGFR 1 (p< 0. 01) and adiponectin (p< 0. 001) expressions.

40|$|Phage display {{technology}} is a biotechnological tool {{that can be used}} to obtain molecules/reagents able to discriminate between target molecules. Reagents with such features can be used in diverse settings like biological chemistry, diagnostics and in therapeutic applications. Phage {{display technology}} is based on the use of recombinant DNA technology, bacteria and a special kind of bacterial virus, the filamentous phage. However, the chance of obtaining high binding strength (affinity) reagents using conventional phage display is limited by e. g. the selection procedure. Therefore, protocols that increase the likelihood of recovering high affinity binding proteins from a pool of similar molecules, a so called library, are of interest. One approach is to modify the selection procedure of phage display, which has generated a special application called selective infection. Another approach is to study the infection process of filamentous phage, in hope of revealing mechanistic events suitable to manipulation. In this thesis, which is based on four original papers, selective infection is evaluated and the infection mechanism of filamentous phage is assessed in conjunction to implications for phage display technology. By analysing the prerequisite for successful selective infection, we found a correlation between the affinity of the interacting pairs and infection efficiency and that a phage format allowing multiple display of binding proteins was superior to one that does not allow such multiple display. Thus, selective infection has characteristics that make it suitable for retrieving mainly high affinity binding proteins from phage display libraries. The infection mechanism of filamentous phage was dissected by analysing the molecular interactions between phage coat protein pIII and the bacterial <b>co-receptor</b> <b>protein</b> of phage infection, TolA. The binding affinities between these proteins and their different domains were characterised and novel interactions were detected, allowing for a refined hypothetical model of the infection mechanism of filamentous phage. Furthermore, TolA mutants were created for the analysis of its phage receptor and outer membrane integrity functions. It was found that these two TolA functions could be segregated, thus emphasising the mechanistic differences between the two functions of TolA. Finally, the changes in gene expression of phage infected Escherichia coli, was monitored by global transcription analysis and it was demonstrated that several host genes were co-ordinately affected. In conclusion, these studies have provided a basis for the development of phage display technology, as well as insights into several different aspects of the infection process of filamentous phage...|$|E
40|$|Background: Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) sets in motion cascades of {{biochemical}} changes {{that result in}} delayed cell death and altered neuronal architecture. Studies have demonstrated that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK- 3) effectively reduces apoptosis following a number of stimuli. The Wnt family of proteins, and growth factors are two major factors that regulate GSK- 3 activity. In the absence of stimuli, GSK- 3 is constitutively active and is complexed with Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and casein kinase Ia (CK 1 a) and phosphorylates ß-Catenin leading to its degradation. Binding of Wnt to Frizzled receptors causes the translocation of GSK- 3 to the plasma membrane, where it phosphorylates and inactivates the Frizzled <b>co-receptor</b> lipoprotein-related <b>protein</b> 6 (LRP 6). Furthermore, the translocation of GSK- 3 reduces ß-Catenin phosphorylation and degradation, leading to ß-Catenin accumulation and gene expression. Growth factors activate Akt, which in turn inhibits GSK- 3 activity by direct phosphorylation, leading {{to a reduction in}} apoptosis. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using a rodent model, we found that TBI caused a rapid, but transient, increase in LRP 6 phosphorylation that is followed by a modest decrease in ß-Catenin phosphorylation. Phospho-GSK- 3 b immunoreactivity was found to increase three days post injury, a time point at which increased Akt activity following TBI has been observed.

Besides well-defined anticoagulant properties, APC also demonstrates anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and endothelial barrier-stabilizing effects that are collectively {{referred to as the}} cytoprotective effects of APC. Many of these beneficial effects are mediated through its <b>co-receptor</b> endothelial <b>protein</b> C receptor, and the protease-activated receptor 1, although exact mechanisms remain unclear and are likely pleiotropic in nature. Increased insight into the structure–function relationships of APC facilitated design of APC variants that conserve cytoprotective effects and reduce anticoagulant features, thereby attenuating the risk of severe bleeding with APC therapy. Impairment of the protein C system {{plays an important role in}} acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe sepsis. The pathophysiology of both diseases states involves uncontrolled inflammation, enhanced coagulation and compromised fibrinolysis. This leads to microvascular thrombosis and organ injury. Administration of recombinant human APC to correct the dysregulated protein C system reduced mortality in severe sepsis patients (PROWESS trial), which stimulated further research into its mechanisms of action. Several other clinical trials evaluating recombinant human APC have been completed, including studies in children and less severely ill adults with sepsis as well as a study in acute lung injury.

40|$|MSc (Med) Molecular Medicine and Haematology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the WitwatersrandIn {{recent years}} {{there has been}} much {{progress}} in understanding and defining the key protein structure-function relationships that mediate Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV- 1) entry into host CD 4 + cells. This process involves fusion of the virus and host cell membranes, following engagement of corresponding viral (gp 120) and target (CD 4) receptor proteins. Binding of gp 120 to CD 4 triggers extensive conformational changes in gp 120, exposing binding sites for the <b>co-receptor</b> <b>proteins</b> (CCR 5 or CXCR 4), and facilitating insertion of gp 41, the viral fusion protein, into the target cell membrane. Following insertion of gp 41, oligomerisation of fusogenic domains on gp 41 is thought to drive the juxtaposition of the virus and host cell and fusion of their membranes. Recent reports suggest that detergent-resistant membrane domains, known as lipid rafts, {{play a crucial role in}} orientating the receptor molecules during this step of HIV- 1 infection. Lipid rafts are typically rich in cholesterol, sphingolipids and GPI-anchored proteins, and are biophysically distinct from the glycerophosolipid bilayer, which constitutes the bulk of mammalian cell membranes. The role of lipid rafts in virus entry, however, is still controversial, and further experimentation is needed to define their importance in this regard. To provide insight into the role of lipid rafts during HIV- 1 entry, we evaluated the natural distribution of the host receptor proteins in HIV- 1 target cells (U 87. CD 4. CCR 5 /CXCR 4). CD 4 was detected in membrane samples fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation using immunoblotting techniques, while CCR 5 and CXCR 4 were detected on whole cells by fluorescence microscopy. We then used a primary CCR 5 -utilising subtype C HIV- 1 isolate (FV 5) to characterise dynamic changes in the distribution of these receptors and gp 41 during viral entry in real-time. Viral fusion assays were set up by inoculating v target cells with FV 5 at 23 ºC, a temperature that allows HIV- 1 attachment, but is nonpermissive for advancement of the fusion reaction. This prefusogenic form of the virus-host receptor complex is defined as the temperature-arrested state (TAS). We found that, under normal, uninfected conditions, CD 4, CCR 5 and CXCR 4 are distributed throughout both raft and non-raft microdomains on the U 87 cell surface, and there is little evidence for any significant redistribution of these receptors into lipid rafts during the HIV-mediated fusion reaction. Interestingly, we observed a change in the structure of CD 4 during the fusion process, which could describe a functionally important event in HIV- 1 entry, or be related to compromises in the integrity of the virally-infected membranes. Moreover, we discovered that gp 41 is capable of membrane insertion and oligomerisation at TAS, in contrast to previous reports that suggest the fusion peptide is not capable of breaching the membrane at this temperature. Our results provide valuable novel insights into the HIV- 1 subtype C entry process, and the involvement of lipid rafts in this stage of the viral lifecycle, that may be relevant to novel therapy and immunogen design...|$|R
40|$|Plants have membrane-integral {{receptor}} kinases {{that sense}} diverse extra-cellular signals, ranging from steroid hormones (1) to peptides (2) and proteins (3). The steroid receptor kinase BRI 1, which controls plant {{growth and development}} (4), binds the hormone brassinolide (BL) with its LRR ectodomain (5 – 8). BL binding to BRI 1 causes ordering of a ~ 70 -residue island domain that together with the LRR core may form a docking platform for a <b>co-receptor</b> <b>protein</b> (7, 8). Based {{on the size of}} the envisioned interaction surface and its proximity to the membrane, likely co-receptor candidates are the SERK family of plant receptor ki-nases. SERK 1 and SERK 3 are genetic components of the BR signaling pathway (9 – 12). BRI 1 and SERK 3 associate in a ligand-dependent man-ner (13), and this interaction can be disrupted by the BRI 1 inhibitor pro-tein BKI 1 (14). The BRI 1 and SERK 3 kinase domains transphosphorylate each other upon steroid sensing (13). In order to study the interaction between BRI 1 and SERK-family proteins, we first characterized the bri 1 sud 1 gain-of-function allele (15) in its molecular detail. A 2. 5 Å crystal structure of bri 1 sud 1 (table S 1) identi-fies the Gly 643 to Glu point-mutation to be involved in the stabilization of the island domain that we previously suggested to be crucial for the interaction with the co-receptor (8) (Fig. 1 A). Glu 643 in bri 1 sud 1 contrib-utes to a hydrogen-bonding network in the island domain β-sheet, which is part of the hormone binding pocket (green in Fig. 1 A). The bri 1 sud 1 – BL complex indicates that bri 1 sud 1 cannot signal independent of ligand, but rather stabilizes the hormone-bound state of the receptor. Consistent with this observation, we find that bri 1 sud 1 plants are only partially re-sistant to the brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor brassinazole (16) (Fig. 1 B). We next produced the isolated SERK 1 ectodomain (residues 24 - 213) by secreted expression in insect cells and obtained crystals after mutat-ing two of the five N-glycosylation sites (Asn 115 Asp, Asn 163 Gln). A 1. 5 Å crystal structure of SERK 1 (table S 1) reveals the presence of 5 LRRs and the canonical N- and C-terminal capping motifs found in plant LRR proteins (7, 8, 17) (Fig. 1 C).

40|$|The {{secretory}} pathway defines {{and maintains}} the intracellular {{architecture of the}} eukaryotic cell. Proteins targeted to either the plasma membrane, the extracellular medium or to specific organelles within the cell are dependent on the correct transfer along this pathway. The importance of its function has become increasingly clear and several proteins in this pathway {{have been linked to}} human diseases. One disease that is genetically associated with transport processes in the early secretory pathway is the combined blood coagulation factor V and VIII deficiency (F 5 F 8 D). It has been established that F 5 F 8 D is caused by mutations in the genes that code for the membrane bound glycoprotein receptor ERGIC- 53 or its <b>co-receptor</b> <b>protein</b> MCFD 2. Together these two proteins form a calcium dependent complex with 1 : 1 stoichiometry that specifically interacts and assist transport of the glycosylated blood coagulation proteins FV and FVIII from the endoplasmic reticulum. In this thesis, NMR-spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography have been applied in order to clarify the organisation of the ERGIC- 53 /MCFD 2 glycoprotein transport receptor complex. The work resulted in the three-dimensional structure of MCFD 2 in solution determined by NMR and the crystal structure of MCFD 2 in complex with the carbohydrate recognition domain of ERGIC- 53. These structures gave a first molecular view of the organisation of a cargo receptor complex in the early secretory pathway and revealed that MCFD 2 undergoes significant conformational changes upon complex formation. NMR and CD-spectroscopy analysis showed MCFD 2 to be disordered in the absence of Ca 2 + ions, but to adopt a predominantly ordered structure upon binding Ca 2 + ions. Hence, these data suggest that calcium binding and consequent folding of MCFD 2 to be the underlying mechanism for the previously observed calcium dependence of the MCFD 2 /ERGIC- 53 interaction. Moreover, the consequences of all known F 5 F 8 D causing missense mutations found in MCFD 2 could be explained at a molecular level. The results highlight the importance of intact calcium binding EF-hand motifs for the structural stability of MCFD 2 and point toward disruption of the ERGIC- 53 /MCFD 2 interaction as the underlying mechanism for these mutations in causing F 5 F 8 D. Overall, this thesis work has provided new insights into the structural organisation of the ERGIC- 53 /MCFD 2 transport receptor complex and highlighted the importance of calcium for the regulation of its function. By studying this complex the hope is that we have shed some light, not only on the mechanisms behind transport of FV and FVIII by ERGIC- 53 and MCFD 2, but also on general processes underlying the assisted glycoprotein transport in the early secretory pathwa...|$|E
40|$|The {{developing}} {{neuromuscular junction}} (NMJ) serves {{as one of}} the best model systems for studying synapse formation since changes in shape, size, and molecular composition can be followed with high spatial and temporal resolution. Formation of the NMJ depends on coordinated interactions between nerve terminals and muscle fibres [1] and requires reciprocal signals from both cells to efficiently regulate all the events taking place during its development. This includes synapse-specific gene expression, generation of action potentials and stabilization events leading to the formation of a sophisticated apparatus which ensures that the muscle fibre is provided with trophic factors as well as electrical stimuli. The receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK and its natural ligand, a neuron-specific isoform of the extracellular matrix molecule agrin, are considered to play a fundamental role in the formation and maintenance of the NMJ. In cultured myotubes, MuSK is activated by neural agrin, and this causes its phosphorylation and results in the formation of AChRs clusters on the cell surface [2 - 5]. The present study discusses different approaches to understand better the mechanisms of how the NMJ is formed and maintained. In the first project, we addressed the question of MuSK – neural agrin interaction and the necessity for an additional component of the agrin receptor complex. We generated transgenic mice overexpressing MuSK or neural mini-agrin as well as both proteins throughout the entire muscle fibre. We found evidence that in muscle cells MuSK is sufficient to respond to neural agrin with no necessity of any additional <b>co-receptor</b> <b>protein.</b> We also show that Dok- 7, a MuSK adaptor protein, limits the formation of ectopic postsynaptic like structures in innervated muscle. From this, we conclude that it is very likely that in muscle cells MuSK serves as a functional receptor for neural agrin. The second project refers to the regulation of the NMJ formation. We found that signal transduction downstream of agrin involves the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, particularly ERK 1 / 2 and JNK. It involves MuSK signaling, requires Dok 7 and is ErbB-independent. We also show that MAPK phosphatase- 1, MKP- 1, plays a crucial regulatory role in formation of the nerve-muscle connection. Results of the third project describe that a miniaturized form of agrin is able to fully rescue perinatal death of agrin-deficient mice, and that this function does not depend on local deposition of agrin at synapses. Moreover, we show that acetylcholine together with neural agrin stabilizes the postsynaptic structures at the NMJ. The function of agrin in CNS was our main interest in the fourth project. Using agrin-deficient mice with a transgenic reconstitution of the expression of neural agrin by motor neurons, we found that in the brain, agrin is localized to the excitatory synapses. Lack of agrin resulted in a strong reduction of synaptic structures in the cerebral cortex coinciding with the attenuation of the frequency of miniature postsynaptic currents. Additionally we found that muscle specific kinase MuSK is also expressed in the brain, thus possibly involved in the formation of the nerve-nerve connections. Finally, we show that agrin function involves MAP kinase signaling...|$|E

Several distinct functions have been ascribed to glypicans including acting as <b>co-receptors</b> for signaling <b>proteins.</b> Recent {{data show that}} glypicans are also necessary for morphogen propagation in the tissue. In the present study, a model describing the interaction of a morphogen with glypicans is formulated, analyzed and compared with measurements {{of the effect of}} glypican Dally-like (Dlp) overexpression on Wingless (Wg) morphogen signaling in Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal discs. The model explains the opposing effect that Dlp overexpression has on Wg signaling in the distal and proximal regions of the disc and makes a number of quantitative predictions for further experiments. In particular, our model suggests that Dlp acts by allowing Wg to diffuse on cell surface while protecting it from loss and degradation, and that Dlp rather than acting as Wg co-receptor competes with receptors for morphogen binding...|$|R
40|$|Connective-tissue {{growth factor}} (CTGF) {{is a member}} of the CCN family of {{secreted}} proteins. CCN family members contain four characteristic domains and exhibit multiple activities: they associate with the extracellular matrix, they can mediate cell adhesion, cell migration and chemotaxis, and they can modulate the activities of peptide growth factors. Many of the effects of CTGF are thought to be mediated by binding to integrins, whereas others may be because of its recently identified ability to interact with BMP 4 and TGF?. We demonstrate, using Xenopus embryos, that CTGF also regulates signalling through the Wnt pathway, in accord with its ability to bind to the Wnt <b>co-receptor</b> LDL receptor-related <b>protein</b> 6 (LRP 6). This interaction is likely to occur through the C-terminal (CT) domain of CTGF, which is distinct from the BMP- and TGF?-interacting domain. Our results define new activities of CTGF and add to the variety of routes through which cells regulate growth factor activity in development, disease and tissue homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|Congenital {{disorders}} of glycosylation (CDGs) {{constitute a}} rapidly growing family of human diseases resulting from heritable mutations in genes driving the production and modification of glycoproteins. The resulting symptomatic hypoglycosylation causes multisystemic defects that include severe neurological impairments, revealing a particularly critical requirement for tightly regulated glycosylation in the nervous system. The most common CDG, CDG-Ia (PMM 2 -CDG), arises from phosphomannomutase type 2 (PMM 2) mutations. Here, we report the generation and characterization of the first Drosophila CDG-Ia model. CRISPR-generated pmm 2 -null Drosophila mutants display severely disrupted glycosylation and early lethality, whereas RNAi-targeted knockdown of neuronal PMM 2 results in a strong shift in the abundance of pauci-mannose glycan, progressive incoordination and later lethality, closely paralleling human CDG-Ia symptoms of shortened lifespan, movement impairments and defective neural development. Analyses of the well-characterized Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) reveal synaptic glycosylation loss accompanied by defects in both structural architecture and functional neurotransmission. NMJ synaptogenesis is driven by intercellular signals that traverse an extracellular synaptomatrix and are co-regulated by glycosylation and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Specifically, trans-synaptic signaling by the Wnt protein Wingless (Wg) depends on the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) <b>co-receptor</b> Dally-like <b>protein</b> (Dlp), which is regulated by synaptic MMP activity. Loss of synaptic MMP 2, Wg ligand, Dlp co-receptor and downstream trans-synaptic signaling occurs with PMM 2 knockdown. Taken together, this Drosophila CDG disease model provides {{a new avenue for}} the dissection of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neurological impairments and is a means by which to discover and test novel therapeutic treatment strategies...|$|R

Ly 49 inhibitory receptors bind to murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and prevent natural killer-(NK) cell cytotoxicity. In this study we have tested whether inhibitory receptors accumulate at the point of cell–cell contact when NK cells encounter target cells bearing MHC class I ligands for those inhibitory receptors. We have used RNK- 16 {{effector cells}} that express Ly 49 A receptors and have found that there was a specific accumulation of Ly 49 A receptors at the point of NK cell–target cell contact when the target cells expressed H- 2 Dd. We also observed that engagement of Ly 49 A on NK cells resulted in an altered redistribution of potential triggering receptors CD 2 and NKR-P 1.

The secretable protein α-Klotho has a function related to ageing processes, and α-Klotho deficient mice have reduced lifespan and declining functions in several tissues. Here, we studied Klotho {{in connection with}} inherited photoreceptor degeneration. Increased nuclear immunostaining for α-Klotho protein was seen in degenerating photoreceptors in four different Retinitis Pigmentosa models (rd 1, rd 2 mice; P 23 H, S 334 ter rhodopsin mutant rats). Correspondingly, in rd 1 retina α-Klotho mRNA expression was significantly upregulated. Moreover, immunostaining for another Klotho family protein, β-Klotho, also co-localised with degenerating rd 1 photoreceptors. The rd 1 retina displayed reduced levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 15, {{a member of the}} FGF subfamily for which Klotho acts as a <b>co-receptor.</b> Exogenous α-Klotho <b>protein</b> added to retinal explant cultures did not affect cell death in rd 1 retinae, but caused a severe layer disordering in wild-type retinae.

Alterations of these levels below or above the healthy limit lead to a systemic deficiency or overload in iron. The type-two transmembrane serine protease (TTSP), matriptase- 2 (also known as TMPRSS 6), is attracting significant amounts of interest due to its recently described role in iron homeostasis. The finding of this regulatory role for matriptase- 2 was originally derived from the observation that mice deficient in this protease present with anemia due to elevated levels of hepcidin and impaired intestinal iron absorption. Further in vitro analysis has demonstrated that matriptase- 2 functions to suppress bone morphogenetic protein stimulation of hepcidin transcription through cell surface proteolytic processing of the bone morphogenetic <b>protein</b> <b>co-receptor</b> hemojuvelin. Consistently, the anemic phenotype of matriptase- 2 knockout mice is mirrored in humans with matripase- 2 mutations. Currently, 14 patients with iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) {{have been reported to}} harbor various genetic mutations that abrogate matriptase- 2 proteolytic activity.

PPS has been shown to prolong the survival of animals after intracerebral perfusion and is in limited use for the experimental treatment of human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Here, PPS is compared with CR 36, a new heparan mimetic. Ex vivo, CR 36 was more efficient than PPS in reducing PrPres in scrapie-infected cell cultures and showed long-lasting activity. In vivo, CR 36 showed none of the acute toxicity observed with PPS and reduced PrPres accumulation in spleens, but had only a marginal effect on the survival time of mice infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy. In contrast, mice treated with PPS that survived the initial toxic mortality had no detectable PrPres in the spleens and lived 185 days longer than controls (+ 55 %).

Different toxin serotypes have different protein receptors; yet, most share a common ganglioside co-receptor, GT 1 b. We determined the crystal structure of the botulinum neurotoxin serotype A binding domain (residues 873 – 1297) alone and in complex with a GT 1 b analog at 1. 7 A ˚ and 1. 6 A˚, respectively. The ganglioside GT 1 b forms several key hydrogen bonds to conserved residues and binds in a shallow groove lined by Tryptophan 1266. GT 1 b binding does not induce any large structural changes in the toxin; therefore, it is unlikely that allosteric effects {{play a major role in}} the dual receptor recognition. Together with the previously published structures of botulinum neurotoxin serotype B in complex with its <b>protein</b> <b>co-receptor,</b> we can now generate a detailed model of botulinum neurotoxin’s interaction with the neuronal cell surface.

40|$|Introduction: Cancer {{cells can}} {{influence}} their cellular microenvironment through intercellular communication. Growing {{evidence indicates that}} microenvironment control {{is supported by the}} release of extracellular microvesicles, called exosomes. Exosomes have the capacity to transfer their cellular content to neighbouring cells and modify their microenvironment to promote tumour-induced immune suppression, angiogenesis, and pre-metastatic niche formation. Still, the function of proteins found in the exosomal cargo and their mechanisms in membrane transport and the signalling events is not clearly defined. The multifaceted receptor, neurotensin (NT) receptor- 3, also called sortilin plays a multitude of roles in the cell as a receptor or a <b>co-receptor,</b> in <b>protein</b> transport to the plasma membrane and to lysosomes, and in the regulated secretion. Numerous studies indicate that sortilin expression is elevated in several human cancers. In this study, we examined closely the secretion mechanism utilized for the extracellular domain of sortilin from human lung cancer cells (A 549) and the effect on the microenvironment. Methods: We use a number of experimental approaches in our studies including lentivirus-mediated RNAi, metabolic labelling, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence (indirect and confocal), Western blot, exosome purification, EM, FACs analysis, co-culture using AMNIS, microarray, invasion assays, ELISA and the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. Results: Here, we show {{for the first time that}} sortilin uses a “canonical pathway” and can be found in exosomes. We demonstrate that sortilin is a key component of exosomes mediating communication between A 549 and endothelial cells. Sortilin is already known to play a prime function in cancer cells; however we report herein that it plays new role in both assembly of a tyrosine kinase complex and its exosome release. This novel complex (TES complex) expressed by exosomes results in the linkage of 2 tyrosine kinase receptors, TrkB and EGFR with sortilin. Using in vitro and ex vivo models, we demonstrate that this complex containing sortilin exhibits a control on endothelial cells and angiogenesis activation through exosome transfer. Summary/conclusion: Taken together our data suggest a paracrine function for sortilin and its partners in exosome transfer and the control of the microenvironment. This novel complex containing sortilin could play the role of as a molecular switch in cancer progression by promoting angiogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{developmental}} {{processes of}} lymphopoiesis generate mature B lymphocytes from hematopoietic stem cells through increasingly restricted intermediates. Networks of transcription factors regulate these cell fate choices and {{are composed of}} both ubiquitously expressed and B lineage-specific factors. E-protein transcription factors are encoded by the three genes E 2 A, E 2 - 2 (SEF 2 - 1), and HEB. The E 2 A gene is required for B cell development and encodes the alternatively spliced proteins E 12 and E 47. During B lymphocyte development, the cells have to pass several checkpoints verifying the functionality of their antigen receptors. Early in the development, {{the expression of a}} pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) with membrane-bound immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain protein associated with surrogate light chain (SLC) proteins is a critical checkpoint that monitors for functional Ig heavy chain rearrangement. Signaling from the pre-BCR induces survival and a limited clonal expansion. Here it is shown that pre-BCR signaling rapidly down-regulates the SLCs l 5 and VpreB and also the co-receptor CD 19. Ca 2 + signaling and E 2 A were shown to be essential for this regulation. E 2 A mutated in its binding site for the Ca 2 + sensor protein calmodulin (CaM), and thus with CaM-resistant DNA binding, makes l 5, VpreB and CD 19 expression resistant to the inhibition following pre-BCR stimulation. Thus, Ca 2 + down-regulates SLC and CD 19 gene expression upon pre-BCR stimulation through inhibition of E 2 A by Ca 2 +/CaM. A general negative feedback regulation of the pre-BCR proteins as well as many <b>co-receptors</b> and <b>proteins</b> in signal pathways from the receptor was also shown. After the ordered recombination of Ig heavy chain gene segments, also Ig light chain gene segments are recombined together to create antibody diversity. The recombinations are orchestrated by the recombination activating gene (RAG) enzymes, other enzymes that cleave/mutate/assemble DNA of the Ig loci, and the transcription factor Pax 5. A key feature of the immune system is the concept that one lymphocyte has only one antigen specificity that can be selected for or against. This requires that only one of the alleles of genes for Ig chains is made functional. The mechanism of this allelic exclusion has however been an enigma. Here pre-BCR signaling was shown to down-regulate several components of the recombination machinery including RAG 1 and RAG 2 through CaM inhibition of E 2 A. Furthermore, E 2 A, Pax 5 and the RAGs were shown to be in a complex bound to key sequences on the IgH gene before pre-BCR stimulation and instead bound to CaM after this stimulation. Thus, the recombination complex is directly released through CaM inhibition of E 2 A. Upon encountering antigens, B cells must adapt to produce a highly specific and potent antibody response. Somatic hypermutation (SH), which introduces point mutations in the variable regions of Ig genes, can increase the affinity for antigen, and antibody effector functions can be altered by class switch recombination (CSR), which changes the expressed constant region exons. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is the mutagenic antibody diversification enzyme that is essential for both SH and CSR. The AID enzyme has to be tightly controlled as it is a powerful mutagen. BCR signaling, which signals that good antibody affinity has been reached, was shown to inhibit AID gene expression through CaM inhibition of E 2 A.   SH increases the antigen binding strength by many orders of magnitude. Each round of SH leads to one or a few mutations, followed by selection for increased affinity. Thus, BCR signaling has to enable selection for successive improvements in antibodies (Ab) over an extremely broad range of affinities. Here the BCR is shown to be subject to general negative feedback regulation of the receptor proteins as well as many <b>co-receptors</b> and <b>proteins</b> in signal pathways from the receptor. Thus, the BCR can down-regulate itself to enable sensitive detection of successive improvements in antigen affinity. Furthermore, the feedback inhibition of the BCR signalosome and most of its protein, and most other gene regulations by BCR stimulation, is through inhibition of E 2 A by Ca 2 +/CaM. Differentiation to Ab-secreting plasmablasts and plasma cells is antigen-driven. The interaction of antigen with the membrane-bound Ab of the BCR is critical in determining which clones enter the plasma cell response. Genome-wide analysis showed that differentiation of B cells to Ab-secreting cell is induced by BCR stimulation through very fast regulatory events, and induction of IRF- 4 and down-regulation of Pax 5, Bcl- 6, MITF, Ets- 1, Fli- 1 and Spi-B gene expressions were identified as immediate early events. Ca 2 + signaling through CaM inhibition of E 2 A was essential for these rapid down-regulations of immediate early genes after BCR stimulation in initiation of plasma cell differentiation...|$|R

Leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin domain-containing protein (Lingo- 1) is a potent negative regulator of axonal myelination and neurite extension. As co-factors of Lingo- 1 signaling (Nogo receptor (NgR), With No Lysine (K) (WNK 1) and Myelin transcription factor 1 (Myt 1)) have been implicated in the genetics of schizophrenia, we explored {{for the first time}} the role of Lingo- 1 signaling pathways in this disorder. Lingo- 1 protein, together with its <b>co-receptor</b> and co-factor <b>proteins</b> NgR, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor orphan Y (TROY), p 75, WNK 1 and Myt 1, have never been explored in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We examined protein levels of Lingo- 1, NgR, TROY, p 75, WNK 1, Myt 1 and myelin basic protein (MBP) (as a marker of myelination) within the post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (37 schizophrenia patients versus 37 matched controls) and hippocampus (Cornu Ammonis, CA 1 and CA 3) (20 schizophrenia patients versus 20 matched controls from the same cohort). Both of these brain regions are highly disrupted in the schizophrenia pathophysiology. There were significant increases in Lingo- 1 (P 0. 05) between the schizophrenia and control groups in the three tested regions.

In these cells, the <b>co-receptor</b> CCR 5 <b>protein,</b> which, like CXCR 4, is a chemokine receptor, is detected mainly intracellularly. We hypothesized that CD 34 + cells secrete CCR 5 -binding chemokines and that these factors interfere with HIV R 5 interactions with these cells, possibly by binding CCR 5 or by inducing its internalization. We found that human CD 34 + cells and CD 34 +KIT+ cells, which are enriched in myeloid progenitor cells, expressed and secreted the CCR 5 ligands RANTES, MIP- 1 α, and MIP- 1 β and that IFN-γ stimulated expression of these chemokines. In contrast, SDF- 1, a CXCR 4 ligand, was not detectable in the CD 34 +KIT+ cells, even by RT-PCR. Conditioned media from CD 34 + cell culture significantly protected the T lymphocyte cell line PB- 1 from infection by R 5 but not X 4 strains of HIV. Interestingly, the secretion of endogenous chemokines decreased with the maturation of CD 34 + cells, although ex vivo, expanded megakaryoblasts still secreted a significant amount of RANTES. Synthesis of CCR 5 -binding chemokines by human CD 34 + cells and megakaryoblasts therefore largely determines the susceptibility of these cells to infection by R 5 HIV strains.

The Hedgehog family consists of three protein ligands: Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Indian Hedgehog (IHH), and Desert Hedgehog (DHH), of which two are expressed in the craniofacial complex (IHH and SHH). Dysregulations in HH signaling are well documented {{to result in a}} wide range of craniofacial abnormalities, including holoprosencephaly, hypotelorism, and cleft lip/palate. Furthermore, mutations in HH effectors, <b>co-receptors,</b> and ciliary <b>proteins</b> result in skeletal and craniofacial deformities. Cranial suture morphogenesis is a delicate developmental process that requires control of cell commitment, proliferation and differentiation. This review focuses on both what is known and what remains unknown regarding HH signaling in cranial suture morphogenesis and intramembranous ossification. As demonstrated from murine studies, expression of both SHH and IHH is critical to the formation and fusion of the cranial sutures and calvarial ossification. SHH expression has been observed in the cranial suture mesenchyme and its precise function is not fully defined, although some postulate SHH to delay cranial suture fusion. IHH expression is mainly found on the osteogenic fronts of the calvarial bones, and functions to induce cell proliferation and differentiation. Unfortunately, neonatal lethality of deficient mice precludes a detailed examination of their postnatal calvarial phenotype. In summary, a number of basic questions are yet to be answered regarding domains of expression, developmental role, and functional overlap of HH morphogens in the calvaria. Nevertheless, SHH and IHH ligands are integral to cranial suture development and regulation of calvarial ossification. When HH signaling goes awry, the resultant suite of morphologic abnormalities highlights the important roles of HH signaling in cranial development...|$|R

However, the exact mechanism is currently unknown. We examined a potential role for Wnt signalling and functional cross-talk of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) - 2 in osteoblast differentiation. To assess the contribution of Wnt, we generated C 2 C 12 cells overexpressing Wnt 3 a or Wnt 5 a and treated these with BMP- 2. We showed that expression of matix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein was induced by BMP- 2 in Wnt 3 a over-expressing C 2 C 12 cells but not in Wnt 5 a over-expressing C 2 C 12 cells. Overexpression of Wnt 3 a blocked BMP- 2 -induced inhibition of myotube formation in C 2 C 12 cells when switched to low mitogen medium. In these cultures, expression of inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation (Id) 1, a basic helix-loop-helix protein induced by BMP- 2, decreased in stable Wnt 3 a, but not Wnt 5 a, expressing cells. This suppression is mediated by a GC rich region of the BMP- 2 responsive element of the Id 1 gene promoter and interaction between Smad 1 / 4 and β-catenin is crucial for Wnt-mediated suppression of the BMP- 2 response in C 2 C 12 cells. Overexpression of the inhibitor of canonical Wnt signalling, Dickkopf, inhibits this suppression. In contrast, BMP- 2 or Smad 1 / 4 up-regulated Wnt 3 a or activated β-catenin-induced lymphoid enhancing factor 1 /T cell factor-dependent transcriptional activity. These findings identify functional cross-talk of Id 1 expression between Wnt and BMP signalling and demonstrate a novel mechanism for Wnt regulation of the BMP- 2 response, linking Id 1 expression to Wnt/β-catenin signalling...|$|R

Studies in different organisms have demonstrated that the first embryonic site that generates HSCs is the dorsal aorta that is surrounded by the gonad and mesonephros (aorta-gonad-mesonephros [AGM]; Medvinsky and Dzierzak, 1996). More recently, cell-tracing {{studies have demonstrated that}} HSCs derive from endothelial-like precursors that express VE-cadherin (VEC; Zovein et al., 2008) as well as Runx 1 (Chen et al., 2009). Important {{progress has been made in}} the understanding of regulatory signals that govern the emergence of HSCs. Some of the signals required for both adult BM HSCs and embryonic hematopoiesis include the cytokine IL- 3 and the transcription factors such as GATA 2 and SCL (Robin et al., 2006). However, other signals, including those mediated by the Notch receptor, are specifically required for embryonic hematopoiesis (Kumano et al., 2003; Robert-Moreno et al., 2005, 2008) and not essential for BM HSC (Radtke et al., 1999; Maillard et al., 2008). There is also strong evi-dence that Notch, Wnt, and BMP pathways col-laborate to generate HSC in the zebrafish embryo and also regulate hematopoietic development from embryonic stem cells (ESCs; Burns et al., 2005; Lengerke et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2008; Clements et al., 2011). Wnt is an important regulator of multiple aspects of embryonic development. However, there is as yet no evidence for its involvement in the onset of hematopoiesis in mammals.
