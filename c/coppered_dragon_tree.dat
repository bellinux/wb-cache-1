50|$|When {{it comes}} to combat, <b>copper</b> <b>dragons</b> prefer to avoid it. Rather than {{fighting}} openly, they prefer to taunt, humiliate, and tease their opponents until they simply give up and run away. Their ability to dramatically slow opponents often gives them ample time to run away. When forced, however, a <b>copper</b> <b>dragon</b> will fight to the very end, and is an incredibly devious antagonist. Their acid breath {{is not to be}} taken lightly.|$|R

50|$|A typical copper dragon's lair is a cave, whose {{entrance}} is concealed by rocks and boulders. Upon entering, visitors {{find themselves in}} a huge labyrinth of tunnels. <b>Copper</b> <b>dragons</b> compete amongst themselves to see who can design the most confusing layout. If a friendly visitor becomes hopelessly lost (which is rather common), the <b>copper</b> <b>dragon</b> will rescue them before they are actually endangered. Once through the labyrinth, visitors {{find themselves in a}} spacious foyer, beyond which is the Main Entertaining Chamber, where the dragon will spend the bulk of its time. Opening off the MEC is a much more straightforward escape tunnel, whose outside {{entrance is}} often fiendishly difficult to locate even when one knows exactly where it is. The <b>copper</b> <b>dragon</b> will know, however, and often uses its 'back door' to get into its lair instead of taking the time to navigate the maze. Obviously, it is far easier for a visitor to enter via the secret door if they can find it, but doing so is considered impolite, especially if they are a first-time visitor.|$|R

50|$|<b>Copper</b> <b>dragons</b> {{lay their}} eggs in a nest of cool sand or clay. Both parents watch over the eggs and raise the wyrmling until it reaches adulthood, whereupon the parents separate. When new hatched, the scales of a copper wyrmling are a muddy brown in color, which {{gradually}} shifts to a glowing copper as it matures. Adult <b>copper</b> <b>dragons</b> are quite social, mainly due to the desire to play tricks upon each other. A visitor to a copper dragon's lair can expect to be entertained at length, although the dragon will become angry if the visitor does not appear impressed with their tricks, riddles, and stories.|$|R

When the mouth is closed, the teeth are completely hidden. They exude a stony odor.|$|R
