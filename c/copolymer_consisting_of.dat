XPS results for PS, PEO, heparin and PS-PEO as powder agreed well with qualitative and quantitative predictions. XPS results for films of PS-PEO and PS-PEO-Hep block copolymers showed enrichments of PEO in the top layers of the coatings. This effect was more pronounced for hydrated surfaces.

3000|$|... 2 -Acrylamido- 2 -methyl-propane {{sulfonic}} acid (AMPS) with a vinyl group {{is commonly used}} as monomer of synthetic FLA due to good thermal stability and low sensitivity to cations (Plank et al. 2006, 2010; Ma et al. 2014). Related researchers developed a series of FLA by copolymerization of AMPS with other monomers to control fluid loss of cement slurry (Peng et al. 2010). It was reported that the <b>copolymer</b> <b>consisting</b> <b>of</b> AMPS and acrylamide (AM) (coded as AAM) had a good performance reducing the fluid loss in oil well cementing (Tao et al. 2011). To further improve the performance of FLA, N,N-dimethyl acrylamide (DMAM) was used instead of AM to copolymerize with AMPS, and the copolymer synthesized (coded as ADM) {{was found to have}} a stronger temperature tolerance, resulting from reinforcement of molecular rigidity due to the existence of −CH 3 (Guo et al. 2012). However, a more detailed study about performance of ADM was still needed under complicated formation environment. N,N-Diethyl acrylamide (DEAM) as homolog of DMAM has longer carbochain and thus, stronger rigid structure, which gives rise to a supposition that the <b>copolymer</b> <b>consisting</b> <b>of</b> DEAM and AMPS (coded as ADE) could possess better fluid loss control performance.|$|E
