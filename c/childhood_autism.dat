40|$|This {{thesis is}} a piece of Creative Analytic Practice which uses auto/ethnographic {{storytelling}} to dis/orientate <b>autism,</b> <b>childhood,</b> and dis/ability. Dis/orientation is a theoretical tool I developed through, and with, the thesis borrowing from Critical Disability Studies’ dis/humanism and Ahmed’s orientation in queer phenomenology. Dis/humanism both desires the human and rejects it at the same time; the vital and giddy experience of dis/orientation is both to be drawn towards a comfortable orientation and at once to reject its seductive temptation as a final resting place or single terrain when encountering lives lived as ‘autistic’ and ‘child’. All orientations to <b>autism,</b> <b>childhood</b> and dis/ability are the effects of repeated and often concealed actions over time which I argue are temporary and changeable, given time and dis/orientating labour. Herein lies the hopeful call of dis/orientation throughout this thesis. Ethnographic fieldwork took place with children and families at home, school, nursery, public spaces and a muddy allotment over an 18 month period. Stories of the fieldwork are told as both method of inquiry and analytical tool. Three analysis chapters respond to my research questions exploring the ‘talking’, ‘being’ and ‘becoming’ of <b>autism,</b> <b>childhood,</b> and dis/ability. I argue that through talk, autism becomes rhizomatic in families' lives and is shaped by, and shaping of, collective identity work, emotional labour, and the neuro-governance of everyday life in neoliberal, commodified times. I argue that some orientations make some beings and becomings of childhood's labelled autistic more im/possible than others. Most significantly, I claim that a turn to embodiment outside of Cartesianism is valuable to theory, policy, practice and research in recognising the potential ‘becomings’ of disabled children’s childhoods in which they exceed subjectivation as ‘autistic’ or ‘child’ with and through their bodies in everyday life. ...|$|R

40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} conditions (ASC) affect more males {{than females}} in the general population. However, within ASC it is unclear if there are phenotypic sex differences.

Using cognitive and behavioral measures, we investigated similarities and differences between the sexes in age- and IQ-matched adults with ASC (high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome).

The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children were administered in childhood (ages 6 – 12) and in adolescence (ages 12 – 20) to 72 individuals with a pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). ADOS calibrated severity scores showed a large stability (r =. 51). Psychiatric comorbidity in child-hood and adolescence were not associated with ASD severity in adolescence.

Both pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of adenine nucleotide transferase 1 (Ant 1) disrupts the non-radial migration of interneurons, but not the radial migration of cortical projection neurons.

40|$|Since 1980 {{the number}} of {{children}} in the United States diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been on the rise. It is currently the number one diagnosed <b>childhood</b> affliction (<b>Autism</b> Speaks, 2011). Despite the increased prevalence, awareness, and diagnostic improvements over the last 20 years much of ASD remains a mystery. There is no known cause and no cure for ASD. A two year old child, who appeared to be developing normally, fails to develop language, shows little interest in other people, engages in repetitive behaviors, and spends hours spinning the wheels of his favorite Hot Wheels ™ car. Parents begin a journey into the world of autism, navigating through the diagnostic process while trying to understand why their child is no longer developing normally. Parents are faced with a myriad of questions and concerns. The stress and sense of loss they experience can be overwhelming to the strongest of individuals. This paper gives a brief history of ASD, identifies the main characteristics of ASD, identifies suspected causes, explores the sense of loss and grief parents often may experience, discusses parental stress, coping strategies, the special challenges faced while parenting a child with ASD and positive personal growth parents may experience because of the child’s ASD. ...|$|R
