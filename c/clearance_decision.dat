40|$|Unexploded landmines {{have severe}} post-conflict {{humanitarian}} repercussions: landmines cost lives, limbs and land. For deminers engaged in humanitarian landmine clearance, metal detectors remain the primary detection tool as more sophisticated technologies fail to get adopted due to restrictive cost, low reliability, and limited robustness. Metal detectors are, however, of limited effectiveness, as modern landmines contain only minimal amounts of metal, making them {{difficult to distinguish}} from the ubiquitous but harmless metallic clutter littering post-combat areas. We seek to improve the safety and efficiency of the demining process by developing support tools that will enable deminers to make better decisions using feedback from existing metal detectors. To this end, {{in this paper we}} propose and evaluate a novel, pattern-based visual support approach inspired by the documented strategies employed by expert deminers. In our laboratory study, participants provided with a prototype of our support tool were 80 % less likely to mistake a mine for harmless clutter. A follow-up study demonstrates the potential of our pattern-based approach to enable peer decision-making support during landmine clearance. Lastly, we identify several design opportunities for further improving deminers ’ decision making capabilities.

40|$|Introduction: There {{is a need}} to {{evaluate}} the influence of risk factors such as patency of foramen ovale (PFO) or "daredevil" psychological profile on contra-indication policy after a decompression sickness (DCS). Methods: By crossing information obtained from Belgian Hyperbaric Centers, DAN Emergency Hotline, the press, and Internet diving forums, it was possible to be accountable for the majority if not all DCS, which have occurred in Belgium from January 1993 to June 2013. From the available 594 records we excluded all cases with tentative diagnosis, medullary DCS or unreliability of reported dive profile, leaving 209 divers records with cerebral DCS for analysis. Demographics, dive parameters, and PFO grading were recorded. Twenty-three injured divers were tested using the Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale V and compared to a matched group not involved in risky activities. Results: 41. 2 % of all injured came for iterative DCS. The average depth significantly increases with previous occurrences of DCS (1 st DCS: 31. 8 ± 7. 9 mfw; 2 nd DCS: 35. 5 ± 9. 8 mfw; 3 rd DCS: 43. 4 ± 6. 1 mfw). There is also an increase of PFO prevalence among multiple injured divers (1 st DCS: 66. 4 % 2 nd & 3 rd DCS: 100 %) with a significant increase in PFO grade. Multiple-times injured significantly scored higher than control group on thrill and adventure seeking (TAS), experience seeking, boredom susceptibility and total score. Conclusion: There is an inability of injured diver to adopt conservative dive profile after a DCS. Further work is needed to ascertain whether selected personality characteristics or PFO should be taken into account in the <b>clearance</b> <b>decision</b> to resume diving.

40|$|On 13 July 2006, the European Court of First Instance (CFI) annulled the European Commission’s {{approval}} of the merger between the music units of Sony and Bertelsmann. In its Impala ruling, the CFI severely criticized the 2004 Commission decision because it found that the evidence relied upon by the Commission was not capable of substantiating its conclusion that the Sony BMG joint venture would not create or strengthen a collective dominant position. This judgment is highly significant {{for at least two}} reasons. First of all, it has potential implications for the future shape of the music industry, since the already completed concentration, which reduced the major players from five to four, is now being re-examined by the Commission. Secondly, and more importantly, the CFI judgment raises fundamental questions about the standard of proof incumbent on the European Commission when dealing with merger cases. After the CFI’s annulment of three prohibition decisions in 2002 (Airtours, Schneider Electric and Tetra Laval), the Sony BMG decision could in fact be seen as an attempt by the Commission {{to take into account the}} high burden of proof imposed on it by the Community Courts. The fact that this decision was annulled for not meeting the requisite legal standard for authorizing a merger, is therefore both ironic and challenging because it puts the Commission on a knife-edge. This paper will address this issue by assessing (1) to what extent the Impala judgment has actually raised the standard of proof incumbent on the Commission and, subsequently, (2) whether or not Impala - seen together with other recent jurisprudence concerning the required standard of proof in merger control - is imposing a too heavy burden on the Commission. Or, to put it more colloquially, this paper will seek to find out whether or not the CFI is imposing a too high standard of proof that the Commission, due to lack of the necessary resources, perhaps cannot meet. First, the concept of collective dominance will be explained and an overview will be given of the case law on the assessment of collective dominant positions in EC merger control. Second, the Commission’s 2004 <b>clearance</b> <b>decision</b> will be discussed. Where relevant, references will be made to previous merger cases in the music industry.

40|$|Tropical {{deforestation}} {{is significant}} {{to a range}} of themes that have relevance for the study of environmental change and economic development, including global warming, land degradation, species extinction, and sustainability issues. Recognition that both the location and pattern of forest clearance are often as important as its magnitude has motivated an increasing number of econometric studies that link satellite data and government census data with the aim of modeling the spatial dimensions of deforestation processes. Initial research focused on time series analysis, while recent work has started developing models that make use of time series data on land use. In this paper, we use satellite data from three dates over an approximate 15 -year period to estimate the probability of a satellite pixel being in a forested or human-disturbed state. Our study focuses on land-use change in an agricultural frontier spanning the southern Mexican states of Campeche and Quintana Roo. This region contains {{one of the largest and}} oldest expanses of tropical forests in the Americas outside of Amazonia and has been identified as a "hot spot" of forest and biotic diversity loss. Over the past 30 years, these forests have been under sustained pressure following the construction of a highway in 1972 that opened the frontier to settlement. The road was part of a larger development effort to promote agricultural colonization and has contributed to a prolonged period of land transformation that has been captured by Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery. We capture these landscape dynamics by assembling a spatial database that links the pixels from three TM images spanning the years 1986 - 1997 and other spatial environmental and GIS-location derived data with government census socio-economic data of data. We develop a simple utility-maximizing model of the forest <b>clearance</b> <b>decision.</b> Based on previous research, the theoretical model suggests many possible determinants of forest clearance in an economic environment characterized by missing or thin markets, as typifies frontier regions in the nascent stages of economic development. We subsequently test the significance of these determinants using discrete choice analysis These modeling questions have particular relevance for informing carbon sequestration and global warming policy initiatives. Other on-going research conducted by the ecologists associated with the project focus on the species composition, abundance, structure, and re-growth of the different forests types in the region. In addition, litter and biomass studies have been completed which included carbon estimates for the different forest types, including forest re-growth on agricultural land, as function of fallow cycle dynamics. Fallow cycle dynamics are extremely important as the region is dominated by semi-subsistence agriculture with very little chemical inputs, so farmers depend on the fallow cycle to restore soil productivity. It will be these detailed data that will be used to calculate baseline carbon sequestration amounts. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E

40|$|This report {{discusses}} the methodology, formulas, and inputs {{needed to make}} characterization and <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions</b> for Bacillus anthracis-contaminated and uncontaminated (or decontaminated) areas using a statistical sampling approach. Specifically, the report includes the methods and formulas for calculating the • number of samples required to achieve a specified confidence in characterization and <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions</b> • confidence in making characterization and <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions</b> for a specified number of samples for two common statistically based environmental sampling approaches. In particular, the report addresses an issue raised by the Government Accountability Office by providing methods and formulas to calculate the confidence that a decision area is uncontaminated (or successfully decontaminated) if all samples collected according to a statistical sampling approach have negative results. Key to addressing this topic is the probability that an individual sample result is a false negative, which is {{commonly referred to as}} the false negative rate (FNR). The two statistical sampling approaches currently discussed in this report are 1) hotspot sampling to detect small isolated contaminated locations during the characterization phase, and 2) combined judgment and random (CJR) sampling during the clearance phase. Typically if contamination is widely distributed in a decision area, it will be detectable via judgment sampling during the characterization phrase. Hotspot sampling is appropriate for characterization situations where contamination is not widely distributed and may not be detected by judgment sampling. CJR sampling is appropriate during the clearance phase when it is desired to augment judgment samples with statistical (random) samples. The hotspot and CJR statistical sampling approaches are discussed in the report for four situations: 1. qualitative data (detect and non-detect) when the FNR = 0 or when using statistical sampling methods that account for FNR > 0 2. qualitative data when the FNR > 0 but statistical sampling methods are used that assume the FNR = 0 3. quantitative data (e. g., contaminant concentrations expressed as CFU/cm 2) when the FNR = 0 or when using statistical sampling methods that account for FNR > 0 4. quantitative data when the FNR > 0 but statistical sampling methods are used that assume the FNR = 0. For Situation 2, the hotspot sampling approach provides for stating with Z% confidence that a hotspot of specified shape and size with detectable contamination will be found. Also for Situation 2, the CJR approach provides for stating with X% confidence that at least Y% of the decision area does not contain detectable contamination. Forms of these statements for the other three situations are discussed in Section 2. 2. Statistical methods that account for FNR > 0 currently only exist for the hotspot sampling approach with qualitative data (or quantitative data converted to qualitative data). This report documents the current status of methods and formulas for the hotspot and CJR sampling approaches. Limitations of these methods are identified. Extensions of the methods that are applicable when FNR = 0 to account for FNR > 0, or to address other limitations, will be documented in future revisions of this report if future funding supports the development of such extensions. For quantitative data, this report also presents statistical methods and formulas for 1. quantifying the uncertainty in measured sample results 2. estimating the true surface concentration corresponding to a surface sample 3. quantifying the uncertainty of the estimate of the true surface concentration.

Trained as an astronomer, Kameny transformed his personal struggle into a cultural struggle that radicalized the gay rights movement and seized the rhetorical high ground.

40|$|Recovery of spores from {{environmental}} surfaces {{is known to}} vary due to sampling methodology, techniques, spore size and characteristics, surface materials, and environmental conditions. A series of tests were performed to evaluate a new, validated sponge-wipe method. Specific factors evaluated were the effects of contaminant concentrations and surface materials on recovery efficiency (RE), false negative rate (FNR), limit of detection (LOD) - and the uncertainties of these quantities. Ceramic tile and stainless steel had the highest mean RE values (48. 9 and 48. 1 %, respectively). Faux leather, vinyl tile, and painted wood had mean RE values of 30. 3, 25. 6, and 25. 5, respectively, while plastic had the lowest mean RE (9. 8 %). Results show a roughly linear dependence of surface roughness on RE, where the smoothest surfaces have the highest mean RE values. REs were not influenced by the low spore concentrations tested (3 x 10 {sup - 3 } to 1. 86 CFU/cm{sup 2 }). The FNR data were consistent with RE data, showing a trend of smoother surfaces resulting in higher REs and lower FNRs. Stainless steel generally had the lowest mean FNR (0. 123) and plastic had the highest mean FNR (0. 479). The LOD{sub 90 } varied with surface material, from 0. 015 CFU/cm{sup 2 } on stainless steel up to 0. 039 on plastic. Selecting sampling locations {{on the basis of}} surface roughness and using roughness to interpret spore recovery data can improve sampling.

40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2013 the European Commission cleared two mergers, Nynas/Shell/Harburg Refinery and Aegean/Olympic II, {{on the basis of}} the failing firm defence. Since the European Commission had only twice before {{accepted}} a concentration on the basis of this defence these clearances raised the question whether the Commission’s interpretation of the failing firm defence had become more lenient. Such a change of practice would have been welcomed both by those who believed that the Commission’s failing firm doctrine was too demanding for merging parties to live up to and by European companies that were experiencing financial difficulties in the midst of the economic crisis. However, the European Commission has repeatedly stated that it cannot relax its application of EU merger control rules and that social concerns such as employment should be tackled by instruments designed specifically for them. This thesis assesses the development of the failing firm doctrine of the European Commission. The aim is to clarify how the Commission has reviewed failing firm arguments invoked by the merging parties and whether the decisions adopted during the recent economic crisis have affected this assessment. The thesis has a doctrinal standpoint as it attempts to explain how the European Commission has been and now is applying the failing firm defence. The failing firm defence is invoked when a concentration has anti-competitive effects but one of the parties to the transaction is in financial ruins and would be forced to exit the market without the merger. Competition authorities accept such arguments only when they assess that the merger is more favourable than the exit of the failing company and its assets from the market. It is argued here, that the European Commission has been fairly consistent with its application of the failing firm defence. Ever since clearing a concentration for the first time {{on the basis of the}} defence in Kali and Salz the Commission has insisted that the defence can be accepted only if the concentration in question is not causing the deterioration of the competitive structure. The purpose of the failing firm criteria it has established is to assist in the assessment of this causality. However, the 2013 <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions</b> seem to have changed the way in which the failing division defence, where only a business branch or a subsidiary of a financially healthy parent company is failing, is assessed in EU merger control. According to the Commission’s initial approach such a transaction could not take place only due to unfulfilled expectations of the parent company. However, both in Nynas/Shell/Harburg Refinery and Aegean/Olympic II the Commission assessed the strategic interests of the parent companies to continue funding their subsidiaries, which it had not done in its previous decisions. The thesis also has a theoretical aspect to it. Competition law has an inherent law and economics approach which is followed here as a series of economic theories concerning merger control is introduced. These theories serve a purpose in educating the reader about the basic concepts relating to the appraisal of failing firm arguments. However, they are also used here for assessing how the European Commission’s failing firm doctrine has developed. It is argued here that the acceptance of the defence in Kali and Salz and in BASF/Eurodiol/Pantochim is compatible with the theory of contestable markets as the clearances were followed by de facto monopoly market structures. Similarly in the 2013 <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions</b> the Commission seems to have taken due notice of the theory as the parent companies were allowed to exit unprofitable markets. However, the Commission has not relied on such reasoning every time it has faced failing firm arguments as its initial approach towards failing division arguments illustrates. Instead it can be argued that both the Commission’s failing firm doctrine as well as EU merger control on a more general level have been and still are influenced by a variety of partly contradicting economic theories...|$|R

Some would take all. The vast majority reported that they would accept such fermented alcohol products as beer and wine, but not for distilled liquor products. Others indicated that their stations refused all alcoholic beverage advertisements and would even refuse to air ads for nightclubs. An index of willingness to air alcoholic beverages and related products became the main dependent variable for the study. An analysis of the research literature suggested ethical, economic and audience factors would best account for the observed variation in station managers 2 ̆ 7 alcohol <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions.</b> Each factor was explored using statistical analysis. Stations with a religious format were unlikely to air commercials for alcohol products as were stations {{with a history of}} format stability. Younger general managers with a business-oriented educational background were the most likely to accept advertisements for alcohol-related products and businesses. However, the most powerful variable in explaining the differences in clearance of these controversial advertisements was found to be the ethical values of the manager, including his or her concern for the audience. Remarkably, the station 2 ̆ 7 s economic and technical conditions did not have much predictive value. No strong evidence was found for a hypothesis that alcoholic beverage advertisements are price discriminated against by stations; that is, these advertisers are charged a higher price by stations because of controversial content. ...|$|R
5000|$|CRI in {{particular}} offers especially broad protection to service members and {{employees of the}} Defense Intelligence Community through the Defense Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Program because CRI is the lead federal investigative entity reviewing security clearance decision-making as a pretext for reprisal. This is done under the Inspector General’s authority, and not through an application of the Whistleblower Protection Act. Section 2302 of title 5 lists twelve distinct prohibited personnel practices that, when following a disclosure of wrongdoing, may constitute a whistleblower reprisal. Severe actions such as termination, reassignment, or demotion are included among these title 5-defined adverse actions; however, security clearance decision-making and other adverse personnel security decisions {{are not covered by}} the Whistleblower Protection Act. Since intelligence and counterintelligence employment is absolutely contingent upon gaining and maintaining a security clearance, review of security clearance decision-making used as a pretext for reprisal is necessary in the protection of Defense Intelligence Community whistleblowers. For this reason, CRI investigates reprisal allegations regarding security determinations through the IG Act, which is not limited by [...] exemptions for intelligence and counterintelligence agencies. Accordingly, a revocation of a security clearance is reviewable as a pretext for reprisal. In its reports of investigation reviewing security <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions,</b> CRI classifies a negative action taken by a responsible management official as a “unfavorable personnel security determination” (USPD) and then applies title 5 standards to its review. In addition to the actions included under the definition of a UPSD, CRI also investigates suspension of security clearances as well as recommendations to an agency’s central adjudication facility to revoke, deny, or suspend security clearances as possible unfavorable personnel security determinations. While not actionable in and of themselves, suspensions and recommendations to a CAF are examined by CRI because they may constitute contributing pretexts to reprisal through security determination. By identifying these measures as actionable unfavorable personnel security determinations, CRI is able to provide broad protection to whistleblowers within the DoD intelligence community.|$|R
40|$|Firms {{that sell}} very short life cycle {{products}} often receive quantity discounts from their suppliers and transporters for placing larger orders. Practitioners and researchers {{have begun to}} recognize the need to decide {{the end of the}} season markdowns by studying the sales pattern. The use of these options can affect supply chain mismatch risks and costs. In this paper, we study the impact of quantity discounts and transportation cost structures on procurement, shipment and <b>clearance</b> pricing <b>decisions</b> through a stochastic programming with recourse formulation. We propose a solution procedure that efficiently solves this stochastic non-linear problem. Our computational experiments suggest that it is not always necessary to select the most complex action plan. Under some business environments, the conventional strategy of placing and transporting a single large order is a better option. We then identify situations where options such as markdowns and the use of quick response suppliers could be useful. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has the {{authority}} to investigate adverse security <b>clearance</b> and access <b>decisions</b> as part of its broad responsibility for investigating allegations that individuals suffered reprisal for making disclosures of fraud, waste and abuse to certain authorities. These responsibilities derive from both the Inspector General Act of 1978 and various statutory provisions applicable to specific classes of individuals. These laws were enacted and amended various times since 1978, and while similar in many respects they are not uniform in the protections they afford. However, they do provide a quilt of legislative provisions organized by the status of individual alleging they were reprised against {{as a result of their}} protected activity.|$|R
5000|$|The bridge {{clearance}} is 135 ft, {{which some}} officials have deemed {{too low for}} ships to navigate. [...] By the time the V-struts supporting the mainspan were put in place, the Port of Houston claimed the struts were an even more dangerous hazard to ships that must veer {{from the middle of}} the waterway. By some accounts, port officials protested, but TxDOT did not listen to their pleas. The bridge cost TxDOT $19 million in its current configuration; a higher clearance would have cost more, and the agency went on to investigate that ships did not need a 120 foot (37 m) <b>clearance.</b> This <b>decision</b> proved to be a mistake. Several ships have collided with the bridge over a period of 27 years, but despite this the bridge only suffered minor damage and was still intact. That all changed in December 2000 when a cargo crane struck the bridge, knocking a hole in the concrete deck and damaging a steel beam. The damage took six weeks to repair, forcing several lanes to be closed in the process. [...] However, the worst accident happened in May 2001 when a freighter's cargo boom caused severe damage to a girder and put another gaping hole in the span. Several lanes of the bridge were closed for two months while repairs were completed.|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{tracheitis}} {{is due to}} {{a secondary}} bacterial infection of the trachea, resulting in the formation of mucopurulent exudates that may acutely obstruct the upper airway, resulting in a life-threatening condition. Bacterial tracheitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any child with acute upper airway obstruction. This diagnosis should also be considered in any child with viral croup that is nonresponsive to conventional therapy. The only definitive way to diagnose bacterial tracheitis is by direct visualization of the trachea via bronchoscopy; however, this may not be required in all cases. Management includes close observation and monitoring, early initiation of broad spectrum antibiotics, pain management and aggressive airway <b>clearance</b> techniques. The <b>decision</b> to intubate should be individualized based on the severity of symptoms, age of child and accessibility of personnel skilled at emergency intubation techniques.

40|$|Two {{concerns}} {{were raised by}} the Government Accountability Office following the 2001 building contaminations via letters containing Bacillus anthracis (BA). These included the: 1) lack of validated sampling methods, and 2) need to use statistical sampling to quantify the confidence of no contamination when all samples have negative results. Critical to addressing these concerns is quantifying the false negative rate (FNR). The FNR may depend on the 1) method of contaminant deposition, 2) surface concentration of the contaminant, 3) surface material being sampled, 4) sample collection method, 5) sample storage/transportation conditions, 6) sample processing method, and 7) sample analytical method. A {{review of the literature}} found 17 laboratory studies that focused on swab, wipe, or vacuum samples collected from a variety of surface materials contaminated by BA or a surrogate, and used culture methods to determine the surface contaminant concentration. These studies quantified performance of the sampling and analysis methods in terms of recovery efficiency (RE) and not FNR (which left a major gap in available information). Quantifying the FNR under a variety of conditions is a key aspect of validating sample and analysis methods, and also for calculating the confidence in characterization or <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions</b> based on a statistical sampling plan. A laboratory study was planned to partially fill the gap in FNR results. This report documents the experimental design developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) for a sponge-wipe method. The testing was performed by SNL and is now completed. The study investigated the effects on key response variables from six surface materials contaminated with eight surface concentrations of a BA surrogate (Bacillus atrophaeus). The key response variables include measures of the contamination on test coupons of surface materials tested, contamination recovered from coupons by sponge-wipe samples, RE, and FNR. The experimental design involves 16 test runs, performed in two blocks of eight runs. Three surface materials (stainless steel, vinyl tile, and ceramic tile) were tested in the first block, while three other surface materials (plastic, painted wood paneling, and faux leather) were tested in the second block. The eight surface concentrations of the surrogate were randomly assigned to test runs within each block. Some of the concentrations were very low and presented challenges for deposition, sampling, and analysis. However, such tests are needed to investigate RE and FNR over the full range of concentrations of interest. In each run, there were 10 test coupons of each of the three surface materials. A positive control sample was generated {{at the same time as}} each test sample. The positive control results will be used to 1) calculate RE values for the wipe sampling and analysis method, and 2) fit RE- and FNR-concentration equations, for each of the six surface materials. Data analyses will support 1) estimating the FNR for each combination of contaminant concentration and surface material, 2) estimating the surface concentrations and their uncertainties of the contaminant for each combination of concentration and surface material, 3) estimating RE (%) and their uncertainties for each combination of contaminant concentration and surface material, 4) fitting FNR-concentration and RE-concentration equations for each of the six surface materials, 5) assessing goodness-of-fit of the equations, and 6) quantifying the uncertainty in FNR and RE predictions made with the fitted equations...|$|R
50|$|During {{the winter}} of 2006, Meyer {{appeared}} in Congressional testimony with Mr. Thomas F. Gimble, Acting Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Defense, and Ms. Jane Deese, Director of Military Reprisal Investigations before the U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Government Reform, Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats, and International Relations. The hearing was called by Congressman Chris Shays (R-CT). In the testimony, the Office of the Inspector General stated that it {{had the authority to}} investigate adverse security <b>clearance</b> and access <b>decisions</b> as part of its broad responsibility for investigating allegations that individuals suffered reprisal for making disclosures of fraud, waste and abuse to certain authorities. Meyer's February 2006 testimony discussed the importance of whistleblower-initiated complaints driving the investigative process so that the offices of inspectors general are not used to target whistleblowers. The issue arose in an exchange with Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) and related to the experience of Sgt. Samuel Provance. In his Congressional testimony, Meyer's positions have typically supported the independence of discrete constitutional actions. This concern for the independence of government decision-making is also present in his first appearance in a court of law, making oral argument in United States v. Graf, 35 M.J. 450, 1992 CMA LEXIS 1032 (Sept. 30, 1992).|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} Air Traffic Control (ATC) system safety, security and efficiency, conformance monitoring must be performed to ensure that aircraft adhere to their assigned <b>clearances.</b> New <b>Decision</b> Support Tools (DSTs), coupled to advanced communication, navigation and surveillance technologies are being developed which may enable more effective conformance monitoring to be undertaken relative to today. However, there are currently no general analysis techniques to help identify fundamental conformance monitoring issues and more effective approaches that new DSTs should employ. An approach to address this need is presented in this work that draws parallels between ATC conformance monitoring and general system fault detection, allowing fault detection methods developed for other domains to be employed for this new application. The resulting Conformance Monitoring Analysis Framework provides a structure to research conformance monitoring issues and approaches. Detailed discussions are presented {{for each of the}} elements of the framework, including the Conformance Basis, Actual System Representation, Conformance Monitoring Model, Conformance Residual Generation and Decision-Making components. Flight test data during a simple lateral non-conformance maneuver was used to demonstrate various implementation options of the framework. Application of the framework for ATC conformance monitoring research was demonstrated using flight test and simulator data in various operational and surveillance environments. Key findings in the lateral, vertical and longitudinal domains during non-transitioning and transitioning flight regimes are presented. In general, it was found that more effective conformance monitoring can be conducted relative to existing systems in the non-transitioning environments when advanced surveillance systems provide higher accuracy, higher update rate and higher order dynamic state information for use in more sophisticated DST algorithms. This is contrasted to the significantly greater conformance monitoring challenges that exist in the transitioning regimes due to Conformance Basis and modeling uncertainties. These challenges can be handled through the use of procedural design, higher fidelity modeling techniques or the surveillance of intent states. Two extended applications of the framework are also presented: a method for intent inferencing to determine what alternative trajectory a non-conforming aircraft may be following and a technique for environmental parameter estimation.

40|$|Passing {{maneuvers}} allow faster {{drivers to}} continue driving {{at their own}} desired speeds without being delayed behind an impeding vehicle. On two lane rural roads, this requires from the passing driver to occupy the opposing lane. This has tremendous implications on safety and operation of two-lane roads. In the literature, several studies investigated the passing behavior of drivers, and some have used driving simulators to analyze drivers’ behavior during following and passing maneuvers. However, the validity of simulators has not been ensured, as their results have rarely been compared with real data. The objective {{of this study is}} to compare drivers’ passing behavior as observed in the field with 49 passing behavior in a driving simulator. This may improve both methods to validate the use of simulation instead of observations. For this purpose, data on passing performance and passing gap acceptance decisions is required. This paper carried out a comparative analysis of the most significant variables related to passing behavior. The results showed similarities between passing time and passing distance of completed maneuvers (during the occupation of the opposing lane). However, drivers passed faster in the driving simulator, keeping higher <b>clearances.</b> Gap acceptance <b>decisions</b> were also found to be similar, as the distributions of both accepted and rejected gaps were similar, although critical gaps were found to be lower in the driving simulator. This might be explained by the absence of objective risks. Consequently, the applicability of driving simulation seems reasonable, although some improvements are still possible, in order to account for sight distance limitations, replicate age and gender distributions, and reproduce better the opposing 60 traffic flow.

40|$|Objective. To {{examine the}} {{duration}} of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage and its determinants {{and the influence of}} eradication regimens. Design. Retrospective cohort study. Setting. A 1, 033 -bed tertiary care university hospital in Bern, Switzerland, in which the prevalence of methicillin resistance among S. aureus isolates is less than 5 %. Patients. A total of 116 patients with first-time MRSA detection identified at University Hospital Bern between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2003, were followed up for a mean duration of 16. 2 months. Results. Sixty-eight patients (58. 6 %) cleared colonization, with a median time to clearance of 7. 4 months. Independent determinants for shorter carriage duration were the absence of any modifiable risk factor (receipt of antibiotics, use of an indwelling device, or presence of a skin lesion) (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 20 [95 % confidence interval {CI}, 0. 09 - 0. 42]), absence of immunosuppressive therapy (HR, 0. 49 [95 % CI, 0. 23 - 1. 02]), and hemodialysis (HR, 0. 08 [95 % CI, 0. 01 - 0. 66]) at the time MRSA was first MRSA detected and the administration of decolonization regimen {{in the absence of a}} modifiable risk factor (HR, 2. 22 [95 % CI, 1. 36 - 3. 64]). Failure of decolonization treatment was associated with the presence of risk factors at the time of treatment (P =. 01). Intermittent screenings that were negative for MRSA were frequent (26 % of patients), occurred early after first detection of MRSA (median, 31. 5 days), and were associated with a lower probability of clearing colonization (HR, 0. 34 [95 % CI, 0. 17 - 0. 67]) and an increased risk of MRSA infection during follow-up. Conclusions. Risk factors for MRSA acquisition should be carefully assessed in all MRSA carriers and should be included in infection control policies, such as the timing of decolonization treatment, the definition of MRSA <b>clearance,</b> and the <b>decision</b> of when to suspend isolation measure...|$|R
