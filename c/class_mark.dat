40|$|An {{estimation}} of the size composition and condition factor of Ophiocara porocephala from Amassoma flood plains, Niger Delta, Nigeria was carried out {{for a period of}} six months (April-June 2010 and November, 2011 - January, 2012) to assess aspects of the fishery status. The flood plain of Amassoma is one of the low lands in Niger Delta providing nursery and breeding grounds for variety of both finfish and shell fish species. Fish plays on important {{role in the development of}} a nation. Apart from being a cheap source of highly nutritive protein, it also contains other essential nutrients required by the body. Therefore the study of condition factor and size composition of Ophiocara porocephala from Amassoma flood plains will provide information on the amount of stock available for the fishery, evaluation of production, information for stock sizes, an important information for the evaluation of mortalities and status of the fish population, estimating the average weight at a given length group and an index of growth and feeding intensity. Length measurement values ranged from 8. 2 - 15. 3 cm; while width, weight and condition factor measurement values ranged from 1. 2 - 2. 5 cm, 3. 98 g– 40. 35 g and 0. 29 - 1. 78. The highest length frequency (26) was estimated for values ranging from 11. 5 - 12. 5 with <b>class</b> <b>mark</b> 12. 0 mm. The lowest length frequency (1) was estimated for length range 14. 8 - 15. 8 mm with <b>class</b> <b>mark</b> 15. 3 mm. The highest width frequency (27) was estimated for values ranging 1. 8 - 1. 9 mm with <b>class</b> <b>mark</b> 1. 85 mm. The lowest width frequency (2) was estimated for values ranging from 2. 2 - 2. 4 and 2. 5 - 2. 6 mm with class marks 2. 45 and 2. 65 mm, respectively. The highest weight frequency (31) was estimated for values ranging from 10. 0 - 14. 9 g with <b>class</b> <b>mark</b> 12. 45 g. The lowest weight frequency (2) was estimated for values ranging 6. 0 - 10. 9 g with <b>class</b> <b>mark</b> 8. 45 g. The highest condition factor frequency (49) was estimated for values ranging from 0. 9 - 1. 1 with <b>class</b> <b>mark</b> 1. 0. The lowest condition factor frequency (4) was estimated for values ranging from 0. 3 - 0. 5 with <b>class</b> <b>mark</b> 0. 4. From a sample size of 81 specimens, K value was 0. 999 and the exponential equation was Wt = = 0. 05998 (TL) 2 719, indicating an isometric growth pattern. There was no temporal variation in the condition of the fish with condition index value 0. 99 - 1. 00 and condition factor value of 0. 999 is an indication of the fish species poor condition...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} research was enhancing lhe self learning motivation by using Problem Based Instruction (PBI) model. The research conducted in 2 cycles, using the criteria of teacher's performance and student's ability toward biological learning. The data awas then analized and intepreted to show the improving teacher performance for each cycle. The result showed that the teacher was a good fascilitalor (score 2, 98 in cycle I and 2, 93 in cycle), so it's able to enhace the self learning motivation of a student, indicated with the increasing point of the readiness of study, the higly motivated in answer and question interaction, ability in answering the questions, giving opinion, creative, and highly motivated initiative to study.

40|$|In Slovenia, the {{majority}} of libraries use the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC). The authors give {{an overview of the}} extent of the use of classification in both open access and bibliographic control in their country. Since 1991 there have been no editions of the UDC published in the Slovenian language and this paper announces the change that occurred when two very important tools were made available to UDC users in 2006 and 2007 respectively. The new Slovenian translation of the UDC was produced by the National and University Library (NUL) in Ljubljana in 2007. This Web edition uses the original structure of the ISO 2709 file format which allows searching of UDC numbers (string searching and full text searching), searching UDC captions, notes, examples, etc. The tool has a user friendly web interface for browsing and navigating UDC schedules via hyperlinks, facilitating checking and selection of an appropriate <b>class</b> <b>mark.</b> At the same time a group of authors in the Slovenian National Library published a Slovenian UDC manual addressing the specific needs of Slovenian libraries and established practice in subject indexing. The manual is abundant with practical examples for both inexperienced and advanced users of UD...|$|E
