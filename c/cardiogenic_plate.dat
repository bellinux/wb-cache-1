40|$|AbstractEndogenous {{patterns}} of retinoic acid (RA) signaling in avian cardiac morphogenesis {{were characterized by}} localized expression of a key RA-synthetic enzyme, RALDH 2, which displayed a biphasic pattern during heart development. RALDH 2 immunoreactivity was initially apparent posterior to Hensen's node of stage 5 – 6 embryos and subsequently in somites and unsegmented paraxial and lateral plate mesoderm overlapping atrial precursors in the <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>plate</b> of stage 9 – embryos. Initial RALDH 2 synthesis in the posterior myocardium coincided with activation of the AMHC 1 gene, a RA-responsive marker of inflow heart segments. A wave of RALDH 2 synthesis then swept the myocardium in a posterior-to-anterior direction, reaching the outflow tract by stage 13, then fading from the myocardial layer. The second phase of RALDH 2 expression, initiated at stage 18 in the proepicardial organ, persisted in migratory epicardial cells that completely enveloped the heart by stage 24. Early restriction of RALDH 2 expression to the posterior <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>plate,</b> overlapping RA-inducible gene activation, provides evidence for commitment of posterior avian heart segments by localized production of RA, whereas subsequent RALDH 2 expression exclusively in the migratory epicardium suggests a role for the morphogen in ventricular expansion and morphogenesis of underlying myocardial tissues...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional (3 -D) {{distribution}} of atrial and ventricular isomyosins is analysed immunohistochemically during {{the formation of}} the tubular chicken heart (stage 7 to 12 [H/H]) using antibodies specific for adult chicken atrial and ventricular myosin heavy chains, respectively. This analysis revealed that both types of isomyosins can be first detected at stage 8 (H/H, possessing four pairs of somites), i. e., when the heart primordium still exists as two separate cardiogenic plates. The ventricular type of isomyosin is initially expressed in those areas of cardiogenic plates {{in the vicinity of the}} anterior intestinal portal. The atrial type of isomyosin is initially expressed in zones caudal and lateral to the areas of ventricular isomyosin expression. Medial to the atrial isomyosin-expressing areas, <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>plate</b> areas exist that initially lack myosin expression. Those parts of the cardiogenic plates that fuse in front of the anterior intestinal portal, thereby forming the heart tube, are characterized by the expression of both isomyosins; however, the caudolateral parts of the heart primordium maintain their single atrial isomyosin expression during further development. Cardiac contractions are therefore first observed at stage 10 (H/H, possessing ten pairs of somites) in myocardium that coexpresses both isomyosin...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{developmental}} appearance of acetylcholinesterase in early embryonic hearts, an enzyme-histochemical study {{was carried out}} in chicken embryos ranging from <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>plate</b> to late tubular stages. Initially acetylcholinesterase is present in all cells of the (future) myocardium. When 13 - 14 pairs of somites have developed, i. e., shortly before blood propulsion starts, acetylcholinesterase selectively disappears from the ventral and lateral wall of the developing ventricle. Slightly later, when 18 - 19 pairs of somites have developed, acetylcholinesterase also disappears from the dorsal and anterior wall of the atrium. High concentrations of acetylcholinesterase remain present in the outflow tract and lower concentrations in a continuous tract along the lesser curvature of the heart, the atrial side of the atrioventricular canal, and the left wall of the atrium. In late tubular stages of heart development, acetylcholinesterase is reexpressed in the inner myocardial layer of the ventricle, i. e., in the developing trabeculae and the ventricular side of the atrioventricular canal, where it is continuous with the acetylcholinesterase-expressing cells of the atrial side of the atrioventricular canal. The expression pattern of acetylcholinesterase in early embryonic chick hearts coincides with that of areas that control the conduction of the impulse and may reveal a cholinergic signal transduction system that is responsible for a coordinated contraction pattern of the myocardium prior {{to the development of the}} definitive conductive syste...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decade we have made an {{inventory}} of the changing three-dimensional patterns of expression {{of a number of}} key proteins involved in contraction, energy metabolism and conduction in developing and adult chicken, rat, bovine and human hearts. These integrated morphological and immunohistochemical studies were complemented with electrophysiological studies in developing chicken hearts and have resulted in a preliminary model of heart development, that explains how the embryonic heart can function without valves and without an atrioventricular conduction system that is indispensable for the adult heart. Cardiomyocyte-specific proteins are first expressed in the <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>plate</b> when 6 somites have developed, while electrical activity becomes detectable only slightly later. Development proceeds as follows: 1. Upon its formation 'primary' myocardium is characterised by anteroposterior gradients in gene expression. Therefore cardiogenesis resembles many other developmental processes in the embryo. It serves as source for endocardial cells and cells specialized in mechanical contraction and in impulse generation/conduction supporting the view that a single population of cells (the 'primary' myocardium) serves as a precursor for these distinct cell types. 2. 'Primary' myocardium is characterized by the expression of alpha and beta myosin, acetylcholinesterase and the absence of fast sodium channels and of connexin 43. It has a peristaltoid contraction form due to a relatively slow propagation of the impulse. 3. In the looping stage, two cardiac segments appear due to the development of atrial and ventricular working myocardium, that is characterized by the expression of either alpha or beta myosin, connexin 43, fast sodium channels, the disappearance of acetylcholinesterase and by a relatively fast conduction. 2 + sinuatrial and atrioventricular node...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} clonal {{analysis}} and sequence of rat phospholamban (PLB) cDNA clones and the temporal appearance {{and patterns of}} distribution of the mRNAs encoding sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase (SERCA 2) and PLB in the developing rat heart determined by in situ hybridization. Both proteins {{play a critical role}} in the contraction-relaxation cycle of the heart. SERCA 2 mRNA is already abundantly present in the first stage studied, in the <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>plate</b> of the 9 -day-old presomite embryo, before the occurrence of the first contractions. This very early expression makes it an excellent marker for the study of early heart development. Subsequently, SERCA 2 mRNA becomes expressed in a craniocaudal gradient, being highest at the venous pole and decreasing in concentration toward the arterial pole of the heart. PLB mRNA can be detected in hearts from 12 days of development onward in a virtually opposite gradient. In essence, these patterns do not change during further development. PLB mRNA levels remain highest in the ventricle and outflow tract, whereas SERCA 2 mRNA prevails in the inflow tract and atrium, although the difference between atrium and ventricle becomes less pronounced. These observations are compatible with a model in which the upstream part of the heart (inflow tract and atrium) would have a greater capacity to clear calcium and hence would have a longer duration of the diastole than the downstream compartments (atrioventricular canal, ventricle, and outflow tract), similar to the observed pattern of contraction of the embryonic heart. The sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes do not reveal an expression pattern of SERCA 2 and PLB mRNA that allows one to distinguish them from the surrounding atrial working myocardium. However, the ventricular part of the conduction system, comprising atrioventricular bundle and bundle branches, are almost devoid of SERCA 2 mRNA. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{dealing with}} the {{problems}} on {{the early stages of}} development of the heart of the toad, have left very little for further study except the question of the origin of the angioblast. However {{on the development of the}} heart of the giant salamander, there are on record only a few experiments which are, as yet, far from satisfaction. Consequently Prof. Shikinami gave me the problem on the first appearance and the further developmental stages of the heart primordia in the amphibia, especially on the difference between these two species of the amphibia (urodela and anura). From many embryos, thirteen giant salamanders and twelve toads were selected and used for this study. A large majority of them were fixed in Zenker's fluid, and stained with borax carmine. After the subsequent treatments in the usual manner, these specimens were embedded in paraffin, trimmed and cut in transverse serial sections with a thickness of ten microns. A number of models were prepared according to Born-Peter's method of wax-plate reconstruction. From the results of these experiments, the following summary and conclusions may be made: 1) The heart primordia in the amphibia is formed from the bilateral primordia which are derived from the <b>cardiogenic</b> <b>plate.</b> 2) In the giant salamander, the pericardial cavity and the angioblast first appear in an embryo with 12 - 13 somites, and the ventral and the dorsal mesocardium are first formed in 17 and 20 somites stages respectively. The ventral mesocardium is more defined than that of the toad. The bending of the heart is first indicated in an embryo with 22 - 23 somites and the blood-corpuscles first appear in the heart in the 28 - 29 somite stage. 3) In the toad, the pericardial cavity first appears in an embryo with 8 somites and it is earlier than the first appearance of the angioblast, since the latter is first distinguishable in the 5 - 6 somite stage. The formation and the rupture of the ventral and the dorsal mesocardium are indicated a little earlier than in the giant salamander. The time of the first appearance of the blood-corpuscles in the heart and the bending of the heart, is also somewhat earlier than the latter...|$|E
