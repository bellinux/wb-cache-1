50|$|Gnateaters are {{notable for}} their absence from these flocks, while swifts and {{swallows}} rarely join them, but will {{if there is}} for example an ant or termite swarm. <b>Cotingidae</b> (<b>cotingas)</b> are mainly opportunistic associates which rarely join flocks for long if they do so at all; {{the same holds true}} for most Muscicapoidea (mockingbirds and relatives), though some thrushes may participate on more often. And though most Tityridae rarely join mixed flocks, becards do so regularly. Tapaculos are rarely seen with mixed flocks, though the collared crescentchest, doubtfully assigned to that family, may be a regular member. Icteridae (grackles and relatives) are also not too often seen to take part in these assemblages, though caciques like the golden-winged or red-rumped cacique join mixed flocks on a somewhat more regular basis. Cuculiformes (cuckoos and allies) are usually absent from mixed feeding flocks, but some - for example, the squirrel cuckoo - can be encountered not infrequently.|$|E

5000|$|The purple-throated fruitcrow (Querula purpurata) is {{a species}} of bird in the family <b>Cotingidae,</b> the <b>cotingas.</b> It is the only species of the genus Querula. It is native to Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama {{and most of the}} {{northern}} half of South America, its habitat being humid lowland forest where it feeds mainly on insects and fruit. It is a glossy black, medium-sized bird and the male has a purple-red throat patch. It nests in close vicinity with other birds of its species. Its population is in decline, but it is a common species with a very wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
500|$|Which {{family the}} species belonged to {{remained}} unresolved {{for over a}} century. According to the Handbook of the Birds of the World, Xenopsaris and its allies were [...] "taxonomically problematic genera that have {{for more than a}} hundred years been shifted back and forth between the <b>cotingas</b> (<b>Cotingidae)</b> and the Tyrannidae". When placed with the tyrant-flycatchers, Tyrannidae, it was considered closely related to the genera Suiriri, Serpophaga and Knipolegus. The uncertainty was not confined to this species, as there was a general confusion about where to draw the lines between the cotingas, tyrant-flycatchers and manakins.|$|R
