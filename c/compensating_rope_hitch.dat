40|$|Tall {{buildings}} {{are susceptible to}} large sway motions when subjected to earthquake excitations. They are particularly affected by long period earthquake ground motions. These low frequency seismic waves resonate with the fundamental mode of the building structure which in turn causes resonance interactions with long slender continua such as lift suspension <b>ropes,</b> <b>compensating</b> <b>ropes</b> and overspeed governor ropes deployed in modular lift installations. Damage due to large resonance motions of suspension/ <b>compensating</b> <b>ropes</b> and cables during earthquake {{are one of the}} most common modes of failure in high-rise lift installations. In this paper an analytical model to predict the dynamic responses of suspension/ compensating/ governor rope system installed in tall buildings under seismic conditions is presented. The model is then used to predict the dynamic performance of the system under long period earthquake excitations. The predictions can then be used to develop suitable mitigating strategies and protective measures to minimize the earthquake damage...|$|R

About an hour after all hands {{had come to a}} halt the clatter of hoofs was heard, and a solitary female, of the Nez Perce tribe, came {{galloping}} up. She was mounted on a mustang or half wild horse, which she managed by a long <b>rope</b> <b>hitched</b> round the under jaw by way of bridle. Dismounting, she walked silently into the midst of the camp, and there seated herself on the ground, still holding her horse by the long halter.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of lift (elevator) systems {{deployed in the}} modern tall built environment can be substantially affected by adverse environmental conditions suchs as seismic (earthquake) activities (as well as strong winds). The building motion (sway) which is induced by those environmental conditions excites the lift system elastic components such as suspension / <b>compensating</b> <b>ropes,</b> belts and cables. A complex dynamic situation arises when the building is excited near its natural frequency which in turn approaches the natural frequency of the ropes. In this scenario resonances interactions phenomena take place. These phenomena severely affect lightly tensioned <b>compensating</b> <b>ropes,</b> as well as travelling cables, that sway at {{the frequency of the}} building displaying non-planar responses. Thus, the lift system designers have to take into consideration the critical characteristics of the building structure before the lift installation is constructed and installed. In this presentation the excitation mechanism is explianed and the dynamic analysis of responses of lift ropes is discussed. Suitable control strategies can then be developed and applied to minimize the effects of adverse dynamic responses arising in the building â€“ lift system...|$|R
40|$|Coupled lateral and {{longitudinal}} vibrations of {{suspension and}} <b>compensating</b> <b>ropes</b> in a high-rise lift system are often {{induced by the}} building motions due to wind or seismic excitations. When the frequencies of the building become near the natural frequencies of the ropes, large resonance motions of the system may result. This leads to adverse coupled dynamic phenomena involving nonplanar motions of the ropes, impact loads between the ropes and the shaft walls, as well as vertical vibrations of the car, counterweight and compensating sheave. Such an adverse dynamic behaviour of the system endangers {{the safety of the}} installation. This paper presents two mathematical models describing the nonlinear responses of a suspension/ <b>compensating</b> <b>rope</b> system coupled with the elevator car / compensating sheave motions. The models accommodate the nonlinear couplings between the lateral and longitudinal modes, with and without longitudinal inertia of the ropes. The partial differential nonlinear equations of motion are derived using Hamilton Principle. Then, the Galerkin method is used to discretise the equations of motion and to develop a nonlinear ordinary differential equation model. Approximate numerical solutions are determined and the behaviour of the system is analysed...|$|R
40|$|In a {{high-rise}} elevator system lateral vibrations of the suspension and <b>compensating</b> <b>ropes,</b> coupled with vertical {{motions of the}} car and counterweight are induced by the building structure motions. When the frequency of the building coincides with the fundamental natural frequency of the ropes, large resonance whirling motions of the ropes result. This phenomenon leads to impacts of the ropes on the elevator walls, large displacements {{of the car and}} counterweight making the building and elevator system unsafe. This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model of {{a high-rise}} elevator system taking into account the combined lateral stiffness of the roller guides and guide rails. The results and analysis presented in the paper demonstrate frequency curve veering phenomena and a wide range of resonances that occur in the system. A case study is presented when the car is parked at a landing level where the fundamental natural frequencies of the car, suspension and <b>compensating</b> <b>rope</b> system coincide with one of the natural frequencies of the high-rise building. The results show a range of nonlinear dynamic interactions between the components of the elevator system that {{play a significant role in}} the operation of the entire installation...|$|R

40|$|Lateral {{vibrations}} of {{suspension and}} <b>compensating</b> <b>ropes</b> in a high-rise elevator system are {{induced by the}} building motions. When {{the frequency of the}} building coincides with the fundamental natural frequency of the ropes, large resonance whirling motions of the ropes result. This phenomenon leads to impacts of the ropes the elevator walls, making the building and elevator system unsafe. The impact loads affect the performance of the elevator installation resulting in interruptions of service and damage to the components of the system. Furthermore, the car, counterweight and compensating sheave suffer from vertical vibrations due to the coupling with the lateral vibrations of the ropes. This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model of a high-rise elevator system taking into account a scenario when the car is parked at the landing level corresponding to the resonance length of the ropes. The model is implemented in a high performance computational environment and the dynamic response of the system when the building is subject to a low frequency sway, is determined through numerical simulation. The results predict a range of nonlinear dynamic interactions between the components of the elevator system that {{play a significant role in}} the operation of the entire installation...|$|R

40|$|Lateral {{vibrations}} of {{the suspension}} and <b>compensating</b> <b>ropes</b> in a high-rise elevator system are {{induced by the}} building motions. When the elevator is in motion {{the length of the}} ropes change so that the natural frequencies vary, rendering the dynamics of the system nonstationary. In this scenario large displacements of the ropes occur when a passage through resonance takes place. Due to the nonlinear coupling, interactions between the in-plane and out of plane directions occur. Furthermore, the car, counterweight and compensating sheave suffer from vertical vibrations due to the coupling with lateral vibrations of the ropes. This paper presents a comprehensive mathematical model of a high-rise elevator system which can predict the dynamic interactions taking place during its operation. A case study when the car is stationary at the top landing level corresponding to the resonance length of the ropes and starts to move downward to the bottom landing level will be discussed. The model is implemented in the MATLAB computational environment and the dynamic response of the system when the building is subjected to a low frequency sway, is determined through numerical simulation with the car following the kinematic profile dictated by the drive control algorithm. The results predict a range of nonlinear dynamic interactions between the components of the elevator system, during travel...|$|R
40|$|Moving slender elastic {{elements}} such as ropes, cables and belts are pivotal components of vertical transportation systems such as traction elevators. Their lengths vary within the host building structure during the elevator operation which results in the change of the mass and stiffness characteristics of the system. The structure of modern high-rise buildings is flexible and when subjected to loads due to strong winds and earthquakes it vibrates at low frequencies. The inertial load induced by the building motion excites the flexible components of the elevator system. The <b>compensating</b> <b>ropes</b> due to their lower tension are particularly affected and undergo large dynamic deformations. The paper focuses on {{the presentation of the}} non-stationary model of a building-compensating rope system and on the analysis to predict its dynamic response. The excitation mechanism is represented by a harmonic process and the results of computer simulations to predict transient resonance response are presented. The analysis of the simulation results leads to recommendations concerning the selection of the weight of the compensation assembly to minimize the effects of an adverse dynamic response of the system. The scenario when the excitation is represented as a narrow-band stochastic process with the state vector governed by stochastic equations is then discussed and the stochastic differential equations governing the second-order statistical moments of the state vector are develope...|$|R

50|$|This knot is {{particularly}} useful where {{the length of}} the running end needs to be adjustable, since feeding in rope from either direction will loosen the knot to be tightened at a new position. With certain types of cord, the clove hitch can slip when loaded. In modern climbing <b>rope,</b> the clove <b>hitch</b> will slip to a point, and then stop slipping. With smaller diameter cords, after being heavily weighted it may become difficult to untie. It is also unreliable when used on a square or rectangular post, rather than round.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{application}} for the cow hitch {{is in the}} handling of large electric power cable in surface mines. Known colloquially as a [...] "Cableman's hitch", it {{is also used to}} attach loops of cable to the back of a pick-up truck during a shovel move. As the cable can weigh upwards of 22 pounds per foot and 3-4 loops of cable can be attached to one length of <b>rope,</b> a clove <b>hitch's</b> shearing force would damage the cable jacket. The Cableman's hitch puts the strain onto the hitch crossing over the two running ends of the rope.|$|R

This technique can be used with a special [...] "pear-shaped" [...] HMS locking carabiner, or any locking carabiner wide enough to take two turns of the <b>rope.</b> The Munter <b>hitch</b> is named after a Swiss mountain guide, Werner Munter, who popularised its use in mountaineering around 1970.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>compensating</b> wire <b>rope</b> line is {{attached}} to the top and to the underside of an arbor and runs through sheaves near those for the operating line. This wire rope line follows a similar path to the operating line. The compensating line is made of two lengths of wire rope: a thick heavy wire rope (e.g. 1" [...] diameter), and a thin wire rope (e.g. 1/4" [...] diameter). One end of each length {{is attached}} together. The free thick end of the compensating line {{is attached to}} the underside of the arbor and the free thin end {{is attached to the}} top. As fly pipe lowers and the arbor rises, more of the thick heavy wire rope hangs beneath the arbor and compensates for the additional weight of the fly lines. This mechanism works well with T-track counterweight systems.|$|R

60|$|Cries of Hush and Silence {{are heard}} among the townsfolk; {{and the sound}} of a {{military}} band, playing the Dead March from Saul, is heard. The crowd becomes quiet at once; and the sergeant and petty officers, hurrying {{to the back of the}} square, with a few whispered orders and some stealthy hustling cause it to open and admit the funeral procession, which is protected from the crowd by a double file of soldiers. First come Burgoyne and Swindon, who, on entering the square, glance with distaste at the gallows, and avoid passing under it by wheeling a little to the right and stationing themselves on that side. Then Mr. Brudenell, the chaplain, in his surplice, with his prayer book open in his hand, walking beside Richard, who is moody and disorderly. He walks doggedly through the gallows framework, and posts himself a little in front of it. Behind him comes the executioner, a stalwart soldier in his shirtsleeves. Following him, two soldiers haul a light military waggon. Finally comes the band, which posts itself at the back of the square, and finishes the Dead March. Judith, watching Richard painfully, steals down to the gallows, and stands leaning against its right post. During the conversation which follows, the two soldiers place the cart under the gallows, and stand by the shafts, which point backwards. The executioner takes a set of steps from the cart and places it ready for the prisoner to mount. Then he climbs the tall ladder which stands against the gallows, and cuts the string by which the <b>rope</b> is <b>hitched</b> up; so that the noose drops dangling over the cart, into which he steps as he descends.|$|R
50|$|The type {{of clothes}} worn {{underground}} {{varies according to}} {{the environment of the}} cave being explored, and the local culture. In cold caves, the caver may wear a warm base layer that retains its insulating properties when wet, such as a fleece ("furry") suit and/or polypropylene underwear, and an oversuit of hard-wearing (e.g., cordura) and/or waterproof (e.g., PVC) material. Lighter clothing may be worn in warm caves, particularly if the cave is dry, and in tropical caves thin polypropylene clothing is used, to provide some abrasion protection whilst remaining as cool as possible. Wetsuits may be worn if the cave is particularly wet or involves stream passages. On the feet boots are worn - hiking-style boots in drier caves, or rubber boots (such as wellies) often with neoprene socks ("wetsocks") in wetter caves. Knee-pads (and sometimes elbow-pads) are popular for protecting joints during crawls. Depending {{on the nature of the}} cave, gloves are sometimes worn to protect the hands against abrasion and/or cold. In pristine areas and for restoration, clean oversuits and powder-free, non-latex surgical gloves are used to protect the cave itself from contaminants.Ropes are used for descending or ascending pitches (single rope technique or SRT) or for protection. Knots commonly used in caving are the figure-of-eight- (or figure-of-nine-) loop, bowline, alpine butterfly, and Italian <b>hitch.</b> <b>Ropes</b> are usually rigged using bolts, slings, and carabiners. In some cases cavers may choose to bring and use a flexible metal ladder.|$|R
