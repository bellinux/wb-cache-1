This ignorance, which obscures the ultimate reality, is necessary because without the realization of this ignorance, true knowledge <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>achieved.</b> Dhumavati also represents yogic sleep (Yoganidra), the pre-creation state of consciousness, {{as well as the}} primal sleep (the Void) in which all creation would dissolve and reach ultimate reality of Brahman. This void is pure consciousness, the cessation of movements of the mind, and silence. Even Dhumavati's ability to spread disease is also considered positive, as disease punishes the wicked and restores cosmic order.

This platform is being built to demonstrate and test the applicability of CORBA technology and TINA principles to support Telecommunication Public Network Operators (PNOs) in their attempt to open their interfaces to third party service providers. The introduction of a Naming Service requires the definition of a naming hierarchy and configuration of ORBs to interwork with the Naming Service. A distribution strategy for the Naming Service in the ESP was devised to minimise the cost of name look ups and to increase reliability of the platform. The support for federation of Naming Services i. e. interoperability of existing Naming Services is assessed. A federated Naming Service is the primary bootstrapping mechanism that enables the application objects throughout Europe to find each other.
