The reviewer found that Viralheat {{was the lowest}} cost, and supported more social media sites than competitors, but lacked the features to support multi-user accounts needed for large (enterprise) customers. The reviewer also praised Viralheat for its user interface and easy <b>cross-posting</b> across different social networks, but said its reporting and analytics were limited. For example, only three date-ranges could be selected when generating a report.|$|E

50|$|A spamtrap {{can also}} be a Usenet {{newsgroup}} whose sole purpose is to lure <b>cross-posted</b> spam. For example, the alt.sex.cancel newsgroup charter states that any article posted there may be cancelled immediately. Thus, a spammer who <b>cross-posts</b> an article to the entire alt.sex.* hierarchy, including alt.sex.cancel, will find that article is quickly cancelled.|$|R

50|$|Like {{the network}} itself, these {{developing}} norms {{remain in a}} state of flux and vary from community to community. The points most strongly emphasized about Usenet netiquette often include using simple electronic signatures, and avoiding multiposting, <b>cross-posting,</b> off-topic posting, hijacking a discussion thread, and other techniques used to minimize the effort required to read a post or a thread. Similarly, some Usenet guidelines call for use of unabbreviated English while users of instant messaging protocols like SMS occasionally encourage just the opposite, bolstering use of SMS language. However, many online communities frown upon this practice.|$|E

25|$|Informal sub-hierarchy {{conventions}} also exist. *.answers {{are typically}} moderated <b>cross-post</b> groups for FAQs.

5000|$|Canter and Siegel {{sent their}} advertisement, {{with the subject}} [...] "Green Card Lottery - Final One?", to at least 5,500 Usenet {{discussion}} groups, a huge number at the time. Rather than <b>cross-posting</b> a single copy of the message to multiple groups, so a reader would only see it once (considered a common courtesy when posting the same message {{to more than one}} group), they posted it as separate postings in each newsgroup, so a reader would see it in each group they read. Their internet service provider, Internet Direct, received so many complaints that its mail servers crashed repeatedly for the next two days; it promptly terminated their service. Despite the ire directed at the two lawyers, they posted another advertisement to 1,000 newsgroups in June 1994. This time, Arnt Gulbrandsen put together the first software [...] "cancelbot" [...] to trawl Usenet and kill their messages within minutes. The couple claimed in a December 1994 interview to have gained 1,000 new clients and [...] "made $100,000 off an ad that cost them only pennies".|$|E
5000|$|Opponents of {{this theory}} argue that social media {{websites}} {{should not be}} treated as public utilities. because these platforms are changing every year, {{and because they are}} not essential services for survival as common public utilities are, such as water, natural gas, and electricity. Furthermore, opponents fear that imposing [...] "utility" [...] status on a social network site, and forcing regulation might lock such a site in as a real monopoly, which consequently, will stop innovation, and counteract competition. Opponents point out that because social media is constantly evolving, innovation and competition are necessary for its growth. But that argument does not take into consideration that a middle path regulation could be, for example, to free the code so that they would use open source software, which promotes participation, collaboration, innovation, learning, transparency, confidence and cost reduction. Reasons that have made Linux, as well as many other open source programs, systems and services (like Apache web server, Wikipedia, etc.), the most popular systems on the Internet. Linux has become the mostly used operating system on the most powerful computers and the preferred operating system for most system administrators around the world. Besides, protocol standards or connectivity between social networks (to guarantee <b>cross-posting,</b> for example) could be made compulsory so that one company cannot place barriers to communication among citizens in order reinforce their monopoly.|$|E
5000|$|After the handover, one new {{neighborhood}} magazine, Boulevards, {{had been}} established by Media Ink. Under Media Ink the neighborhood magazines had focuses on citywide calendar listings, historical events, lifestyle columns, local events, and people. In 1996 Media Ink changed the six monthly neighborhood magazines into a new format. The company began using large, high-quality photos frequently and adopting a magazine-style format described by Walker C. Wooding, Jr. of the Houston Business Journal as [...] "more sophisticated". 1999 Wooding said [...] "Media Ink has transformed the design with a more sophisticated, magazine-style format and the extensive use of large, high-quality photos." [...] He added that [...] "In conceptualizing and styling the covers, Media Ink took the approach of treating black and white photography as high art rather than a limitation in printing" [...] and that it slowly became [...] "the publication's feature photography." [...] Collins said [...] "We feel that black and white photography {{should be treated as}} art, not as a limitation of printing." [...] Media Ink had considered establishing other neighborhood titles, but it chose not to. Media Ink chose to distribute its magazines on newsstands to increase circulations. In its neighborhood magazines Media Ink established a new contents page [...] "Grapevine" [...] section that was distinct from its other regular-running columns. The company began <b>cross-posting</b> stories to various neighborhood publications, so that a story occurring in one neighborhood that would be of interest to another appeared in the other neighborhood's magazine.|$|E
