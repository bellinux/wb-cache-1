25|$|Concrete is a {{composite}} material composed of <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregate</b> bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time. Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as ciment fondu. However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer.|$|E
25|$|Concrete {{surfaces}} (specifically, Portland cement concrete) {{are created}} using a concrete mix of Portland cement, <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregate,</b> sand and water. In virtually all modern mixes {{there will also}} be various admixtures added to increase workability, reduce the required amount of water, mitigate harmful chemical reactions and for other beneficial purposes. In many cases {{there will also be}} Portland cement substitutes added, such as fly ash. This can reduce the cost of the concrete and improve its physical properties. The material is applied in a freshly mixed slurry, and worked mechanically to compact the interior and force some of the cement slurry to the surface to produce a smoother, denser surface free from honeycombing. The water allows the mix to combine molecularly in a chemical reaction called hydration.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{shows the}} effect of <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregates</b> in {{concrete}} with perfobond rib via experimental and FE analysis. First, the model of a single PBL in ordinary concrete was reproduced through a three-dimensional nonlinear FE model. <b>Coarse</b> <b>aggregates</b> {{were added to the}} model; {{it was found that the}} <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregates</b> around the perforation of PBL increased its initial load-carrying capacity. Furthermore, the interlocking of these <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregates</b> was found to affect PBL behavior after the peak of load-carrying capacity. Next, analytical numerical modeling of push-out tests of single PBL was performed to investigate the role of <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregates.</b> It was confirmed that the initial load-carrying capacity could be increased via the vertical loading stress from the steel to the <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregates.</b> Finally, the numerical modeling results were verified by actual push-out tests of single PBL with systematically sorted <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregates...</b>|$|R

The particle sizes of the CSs used as main <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregates</b> range from 5 mm to 20 mm. The Marshall Stability test shows that the optimum bitumen content for asphalt mixtures is 5. 1 %. The engineering properties investigated include the volumetric, dynamic creep, indirect tensile strength, and resilient modulus. Test results show that stability decreases with increasing CS content because of high water absorption. Considering that CSs absorb bitumen, a further detailed investigation is needed to assess the performance of modified bitumen on mixture. Furthermore, the use of CSs as <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregates</b> in asphalt concrete help increase the resilient modulus, stiffness, and indirect tensile strength up to 30 %.

40|$|International audienceThe {{following}} work is {{an experimental}} study of the behaviour of very early-age concrete. Six different concretes, four of them containing recycled <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregates</b> were studied for the first 2. 5 hours. The {{studies were carried out}} in a ventilated tunnel in order to imitate severe desiccation conditions. In order to indirectly obtain the permeability coefficient, settlement, capillary depression and evaporation were measured for all six concretes. The initial permeability coefficient of each concrete is determined starting from initial bleeding rate. The use of recycled <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregates</b> leads to a high bleeding rate for high water to cement ratios. Permeability coefficients at air entry are then determined starting from capillary depression gradients. Recycled <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregates</b> do not seem to influence the air entry value which is highly dependent on the paste quality. At air entry, the permeability coefficient of recycled <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregates</b> concrete mixes is higher than that of natural aggregates concrete mixes. At high evaporation rates, in severe desiccation conditions, recycled <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregates</b> seem to reduce bleeding for mixture with low water cement ratios.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, the {{flexible}} road pavements {{have been subjected}} to the action of a more intense traffic, which has often originated their premature degradation. Among others, to guarantee a better performance of the pavement, it is essential that the bituminous mixtures show an appropriate behaviour in situ for the high solicitations to which they will be submitted. The bituminous mixtures behaviour is evaluated through tests that allow the study of their properties. The bond between the mastic and the <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregates</b> may possibly influence the behaviour of a bituminous mixture in the pavement. Thus, the main aim of this work was the study of the bond between mastic and <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregates,</b> trying not only to contribute to a better knowledge of this property, but also to a better behaviour of the bituminous mixtures in situ. A proceeding to study the mastic composition was developed and mechanical tests were used in order to evaluate the bond between mastic and <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregates,</b> which is determined through the tensile and shear strengths.

Therefore, the recycled aggregate satisfies the absorption specification. Also, add different portions of recycled aggregate to the mixture will have different degrees of influences on the specific gravity, characteristic strength, compressive strength, modulus elasticity and flexural strength. They mix 0%, 35%, 50% and 65% of recycled aggregate into the mixture and found that as the percentage of recycled aggregate are added increases, the specific gravity, characteristic strength, compressive strength, modulus elasticity and flexural strength decreases. We couldn't indicate that the recycled aggregate is not good for using just by comparing these data with the natural aggregate properties. If we use 65% of recycled aggregate or above, each physical properties will drop greatly. However, if we limit the portion of recycled aggregate adds to concrete, it won't affect each property much.

5000|$|FMA is a gap-graded {{mix with}} a high <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregate</b> (stone) content of 70-80 %, binder (asphalt) content of 6 % and filler (limestone sand) content of around 7-11 %. The {{percentage}} of cellulose fibre that {{is required for the}} FMA is 0.4 % and air voids of around 4 %. The skeletal formation of the <b>coarse</b> <b>aggregate</b> provides high resistance to deformation. Adding the fibres to the binder will prevent the asphalt from draining off during storage, transport and paving. The mastic fills the voids and retaining the aggregate in place. It has an additional stabilising effect, as well as providing the designed air voids. The result is a highly durable rut resistant asphalt mix. FMA can be used on all types of road and it is suitable for roads with heavy traffic loads and frequency. It is high binder content gives a longer lifetime than conventional mixes. Furthermore, it allows for the bitumen to bulk or thicken in order to prevent it from running off the aggregate before compaction. Its coarse and open texture generally provides high skid resistance at all speeds, as well as good drainage and fewer spray problems. Modification and stabilization of the asphalt binder is the approach to improve the pavement performance especially for the gap-graded mixtures such as FMA, which required higher viscosity asphalt binder. The method for this asphalt binder modification is by adding cellulose fibre and other oil- based materials are being used to enhance the viscosity of the base binder.|$|E
