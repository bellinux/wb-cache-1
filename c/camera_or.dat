5|$|In 3D video games, {{a virtual}} camera system aims at {{controlling}} a <b>camera</b> <b>or</b> {{a set of}} cameras to display a view of a 3D virtual world. Camera systems are used in videogames where their purpose is to show the action at the best possible angle; more generally, they are used in 3D virtual worlds when a third person view is required.|$|E
5|$|The {{video of}} the {{performance}} was recorded using six cameras. At brief times during the performance, the video recorded a moment of white on <b>camera</b> <b>or</b> a dark screen, {{both of which were}} related to the use of strobe lights. An individual dressed in costume as Friday the 13th character Jason Voorhees made an appearance on-stage at one point during the performance.|$|E
5|$|The postcards used to {{introduce}} a country and their participants were shot in their respective countries and featured the artists using unique ways to create their country's flag, e.g. the postcard for the United Kingdom features Molly creating the Union Flag from AEC Routemaster buses, Royal Mail vans, and people wearing blue raincoats along with strips of red and white paper, and the postcard for Denmark featuring Basim and his singers using old furniture and red and white paint to paint the Danish flag. The postcards then ended with the act taking a picture on a <b>camera</b> <b>or</b> phone and a close up of the resulting artwork was shown onscreen. The flag created by the artist(s) is then captured into a diamond and it transitions to the official flag. It then swirls round for the before-hand details of the artist/composer. For example, the entry for San Marino features the painting of the flag that Valentina Monetta (the artist) created, transitioning into the official flag for San Marino.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{participants}} {{have attempted to}} document their activities with <b>cameras</b> <b>or</b> video recorders. The film or tape from these are often seized by store authorities.

5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a video display screen (provided by a video <b>camera</b> <b>or</b> digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E

These are usually wide-angle lenses with fixed aperture, and cameras with these lenses generally use a viewfinder for composition.|$|R
