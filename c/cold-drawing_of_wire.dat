40|$|Abstract. The term <b>cold-drawing</b> <b>of</b> tubes {{refers to}} forming {{when the final}} {{material}} (a tube) is formed in a pipe bell and its vertical cross-section is smaller, the tube wall is thinner or thicker and its length is greater. Steel is most commonly the final material. The forming proceeds in a few draws which depend on the final tube dimension. The selection of relative reduction for particular diameters {{plays an important role}} because an unbalanced reduction causes stress, and therefore also deformation or cracks during drawing. For cold-drawn tubes occurs to the deformation of hardening. In the technological process has an important role in recrystallization. In the paper we evaluate the microstructure of drawn tubes in the longitudinal direction between operating without recrystallization annealing.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} self-producing heat and {{external}} radiation on the insulating property <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> are studied experimentally in this paper. In the experiments of self-producing heat <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> 6 types <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> are used under {{the situation of}} overloading. The {{results show that the}} effect of the temperature rise <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> on insulating property <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> is remarkable. Under the situation of having electric current wired to produce heat by itself, the insulation resistance <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> decreases and the leakage of electricity electric current enhances. Under the situation that electric current is relatively stable, the temperature becomes stable when rising to a certain value, conducting wire heat dissipating and fever heat are in an equilibrium state. In the experiments of external radiation, such as the situation of building fire, RV sheathed wires present a similar regulation to the self-producing heat experiments. The difference is that the effect of external factor (such as air flow, voltaic instability, etc.) on temperature <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> is more obvious than that on the insulation resistance <b>of</b> <b>wire.</b> When external factor makes the wire temperature decrease to a certain value, the insulation resistance value is higher than that out of the effect...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the reproducibility <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes to characterise residential power line configurations {{and to determine}} the extent to which wire codes provide a proxy measure of residential magnetic field strength in a case-control study of childhood leukaemia conducted in nine states within the United States. METHODS: Misclassification <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes was assessed with independent measurements by two technicians for 187 residences. The association between categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and measured level of magnetic field was evaluated in 858 residences with both a wire code measurement and a 24 hour measurement of the magnetic field in the bedroom. The strength of the association between category <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and risk of leukaemia was examined in two regions with different average levels of magnetic field in homes with high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code. RESULTS: The reproducibility of any of three different classifications <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes was excellent (kappa > or = 0. 89). Mean and median magnetic fields, and the percentage of homes with high magnetic fields increased with increasing category for each <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code classification schemes. The size of the odds ratios for risk of leukaemia and high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code did not reflect the mean levels of the magnetic field in those categories in two study regions. CONCLUSION: Misclassification <b>of</b> categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code is not a major source of bias in the study. Wire codes provide a proxy measure of exposure to residential magnetic fields. If magnetic fields were a risk factor for leukaemia, however, there would be some attenuation of risk estimates based on <b>wire</b> codes because <b>of</b> misclassification of exposure to magnetic fields at both extremes <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code range. The lack of an association between high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and risk of leukaemia cannot be explained by a failure <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code classification schemes to estimate exposure to magnetic fields in the study area...|$|R
