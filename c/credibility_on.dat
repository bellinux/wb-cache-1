5|$|In 1939, the Department of Justice {{created the}} Civil Rights Section, which focused {{primarily}} on First Amendment and labor rights. The increasing scrutiny of totalitarianism in the lead-up to World War II brought increased attention to issues of slavery and involuntary servitude, abroad and at home. The U.S. sought to counter foreign propaganda and increase its <b>credibility</b> <b>on</b> the race issue by combatting the Southern peonage system. Under the leadership of Attorney General Francis Biddle, the Civil Rights Section invoked the constitutional amendments and legislation of the Reconstruction Era {{as the basis for}} its actions.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{election}} was a surprise for the public, later investigations by newspaper Capital {{made clear that the}} appointment was not as spontaneous as claimed by BSP. In fact, it was carefully orchestrated and prepared long before BSP was able to form a cabinet. The appointment of Peevski caused widespread indignation. Even president Plevneliev spoke out against it and stated that the Cabinet of Prime Minister Oresharski has lost <b>credibility.</b> <b>On</b> 14 June 2013, Plevneliev cancelled his intended visit to Vidin for the unveiling of the Danube Bridge 2 due to his disagreement with the Peevski nomination. Political scientist Ivan Krastev commented that the Peevski appointment made sense only if the government had taken a decision for the country to leave the European Union. In the early phase of the protest, center-right politician and poet Edvin Sugarev began a hunger strike, though he was persuaded to discontinue it by family members after 22 days, as his worsening health condition necessitated a hospitalization.|$|E
25|$|In {{opposition}} to Ramesses' strength in international affairs, Hattušiliš III was disadvantaged by questions of legitimacy that raised {{doubts about his}} position as king of the Hittites. Although Hattušiliš had defeated his nephew, Urhi-Tesub, for the throne in all regards he continued {{to be seen as}} a usurper of the kingship. Urhi-Tesub's determination to regain the throne from his uncle caused the Hittite empire to enter into a period of instability both at home and abroad. The nephew had been banished after an unsuccessful coup and had ended up in Egypt. Ramesses II thereby posed a direct threat to Hattušiliš' reign by harboring Urhi-Tesub within Egypt's borders. Hattušiliš realized that only an alliance with Ramesses could prevent the monarch from unleashing his nephew back into contention with him for the throne. By completing a treaty with Egypt, Hattušiliš also hoped that garnering the endorsement as the true king of Hatti by Ramesses would effectively reconcile the disaffected elements in his kingdom that backed Urhi-Tesub as the rightful possessor of the kingship. In the Near Eastern world Ramesses wielded great power amongst the rulers of the day and formal recognition from him would give Hattušiliš <b>credibility</b> <b>on</b> the international scene as well.|$|E

500|$|On 6 May 1948, Kenney {{spoke to}} a crowd in Bangor, Maine, telling them that the US {{was likely to be}} {{attacked}} by the Soviet Union as soon as the latter had enough atomic bombs. In Washington, D.C., a group of senators including Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. complained of Kenney's [...] "belligerent" [...] speech, and previous ones in the same vein by Symington, saying that matters of foreign policy should be left to the president and the secretary of state, not to leaders of the United States Air Force (USAF). Another controversy that Kenney became embroiled in concerned the Convair B-36 Peacemaker. He was less than impressed with this expensive and under-performing aircraft, preferring the Boeing B-50 Superfortress, an upgraded version of the B-29 instead. The USAF, however, had staked much of its <b>credibility</b> <b>on</b> the B-36, something that Kenney did not seem to appreciate.|$|E

Throughout the month, he visited Iowa and reflected similar rhetoric to the 2004 Kerry campaign, advocating energy independence, fair trade, lowering the federal deficit and an improved handling of the war in Iraq.

500|$|Twenty-six people, mainly police officers, {{were interviewed}} in 1998 {{as part of}} the {{subsequent}} PIC inquiry. Several witnesses from the party, as well as Webster, Wilson and NC1 were also questioned. The inquiry heard allegations that police assaulted four people during interviews: Webster, Wilson, NC1 and another unnamed suspect referred to as NC5, a relative of Webster who was 17 {{at the time of the}} murder. Admitting to the inquiry that he killed Leigh and insisting that he was alone in doing so, Webster stated that police repeatedly punched and kicked him when he refused to confess to her murder. According to Scott Tucker writing in The Newcastle Herald, police were also accused of threatening violence, falsifying reports and withholding evidence; one of the officers being investigated had his police locker raided by internal affairs, who discovered several records on the murder that had previously been listed as missing. Carrington was also summoned to give evidence, though she was not informed why; her book, Who Killed Leigh Leigh, which criticised police over their handling of the investigation, had been released earlier that year. Carrington was cross-examined for three days, longer than any of the police officers who were questioned, in what was described by Hillary Byrne-Armstrong as [...] "an inquisition on just about every word she had spoken [...] written" [...] in relation to Leigh's murder". Byrne-Armstrong accused the PIC of summoning Carrington for the sole purpose of attacking her <b>credibility</b> <b>on</b> issues they had no intention of investigating, and to discredit someone who had attracted considerable media attention for criticising police.|$|E

40|$|Background problem: Previous {{studies have}} found that source {{credibility}} of eWOM has impact on perceived persuasiveness of the source. Source credibility {{plays an important role in}} the effectiveness of eWOM. The more credibility a product is perceived, the more persuasiveness the information has. There are two models that are commonly used in studying the perceived credibility of the source of information, which are source credibility model (Perceived source <b>credibility</b> depends <b>on</b> expertise and trustworthiness.) and source attractiveness model (Perceived source <b>credibility</b> depends <b>on</b> familiarity, similarity and likeability). Purpose: Combining the two commonly used models, this study investigated the perceived <b>credibility</b> of sources <b>on</b> social media and its impact on Chinese students’ travel destination decisions. Method: In this study, a qualitative semi-structured interview approach was adopted. Chinese students were invited to recall and talk about their experience of using social media to gather travel information. After the answers were transcribed, they were coded into categories based on the meaning of the context. Findings: The results showed that higher perceived trustworthiness, expertise and attractiveness lead to higher perceived source credibility. Higher source credibility results in more persuasion.

2500|$|His own {{letters and}} diary entries, at times written under {{emotional}} duress as he relived events that would as always disturb him greatly, support the conventional historical {{account of the}} assassination. His frankness, his tone, and the details that he provides all speak to his <b>credibility</b> <b>on</b> this topic. His final break with Yusupov in London in 1920 is well documented in letters exchanged between the two men, none of which has ever been published. The originals {{are all part of}} the Ilyinsky family collection, along with Dmitri's diaries, and have been woefully, almost incredibly, neglected by scholars. Dmitri, [...] who, as an adolescent, had envisioned Nicholas II as a 'man of action' and admired him greatly, was devastatingly disillusioned by the Tsar's attitude and behavior during the war years. Like many other grand dukes, he unsuccessfully tried to warn Nicholas of Russia's imminent peril. The assassination was, in his conception, a patriotic act and one of desperation, but he almost immediately regretted it and would later describe on several occasions in his letters and diaries the disgust and remorse that he felt about his own involvement in the affair. Yusupov was, in 1920, offered a chance to speak about the assassination in a US lecture tour, the profits from which would go to the Red Cross, and it was his interest in pursuing the tour that proved to be the last straw in his relationship with Dmitri.|$|E
