40|$|The 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris (COP 21) {{agreed upon}} {{limiting}} {{global mean temperature}} increase to less than 2 °C compared to pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts towards limiting temperature increase to 1. 5 °C. Policymakers that face this <b>climate</b> <b>objective</b> are confronted with difficult questions about how this goal can be achieved. Several fields of research, methods and tools are available to help shape {{our understanding of the}} needed change to attain the above-mentioned <b>climate</b> <b>objective,</b> including the use of historical references to draw lessons from the past for the future, expert knowledge on current trends and future transition routes and model-based scenarios that allow to explore different future pathways under specific conditions and climate policies. Model-based scenarios, developed by Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), have proven to be helpful in informing policy makers about key elements of long-term systemic change in the past. However, as insights are generally based on simplified and idealised assumptions on future system change, these studies may be considered as being more of an exploratory rather than predictive nature. It is therefore relevant to assess the ability of IAMs to represent future system change and thereby their ability to inform policy makers on meeting a long-term <b>climate</b> <b>objective.</b> By placing IAM outcomes in the light of other fields of knowledge one can evaluate whether IAMs are able to complement or contrast the various perspectives on future system change. In this dissertation, three perspectives have been systematically compared to identify the commonalities and differences in prospected future change. First, various IAMs have been compared amongst each other to study the robust patterns in model-based scenario analyses looking into limiting global mean temperature increase to 2 °C. Secondly, the projected future rates of change by IAMs have been compared to rates of change as observed in the past. Thirdly, the projected rates of change by IAMs have been compared to rates of change as estimated by experts in the field of various energy technologies. To move beyond the existing conceptualisation of systems change as devised by IAMs - which is often based on economics, engineering, and natural sciences - new approaches to broaden the scope of IAMs have been developed and researched. In a final study the national arrangements and policy-evaluation processes for long-term climate policy have been analysed. The dissertation concludes that a broader perspective on future system change allows a more critical appraisal of the considered future opportunities and challenges in a disciplinary field. Overall agreement between the various perspectives has been found for the 2 °C development trajectory for wind power towards 2050, whereas differences in perspective have been revealed for other (energy) technologies, particularly nuclear power, bioelectricity and carbon capture and storage. However, in order to come to a more holistic view on future system change in line with the 2 °C <b>climate</b> <b>objective,</b> further research may focus on broadening the scope of assessment. Considered avenues are the inclusion of a broader system view, greater engagement with other fields of research and the development of alternative transition pathways...|$|E

However, because of incomplete understanding of the effects of geoengineering on the climate system, its implementation would be in the presence of substantial uncertainties. In our study, we use two fully coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation models: one in which the geoengineering strategy is designed, and one in which geoengineering is implemented (a real-world proxy). We show that regularly adjusting the amount of solar geoengineering in response to departures of the observed global mean climate state from the predetermined objective (sequential decision making; an explicit feedback approach) can manage uncertainties and result in achievement of the <b>climate</b> <b>objective</b> in both the design model and the real-world proxy.

However, minimizing {{greenhouse gas emissions}} is not necessarily compatible with environmental protection or sustainable development, as the examples of nuclear energy, hydropower and biofuels illustrate. Therefore, climate policy integration needs to be compatible with the overarching objective of sustainable development. This article discusses under which conditions legislation that integrates <b>climate</b> <b>objectives</b> contributes to sustainable development and how this can be evaluated at the policy proposal stage. The key contribution is to illustrate in the European context how legislation on climate policy integration can be designed to also contribute to sustainable development.

Policy implications are the inclusion of these criteria for sustainable climate policy integration into EU impact assessments and their use as minimum benchmarks in the policy debate as an evaluation tool that can be easily used by policy makers and stakeholders to evaluate if a negotiated compromise on a policy that integrates <b>climate</b> <b>objectives</b> still contributes to both reducing emissions and sustainable development...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} when a {{subgroup}} of countries cooperate on emission reduction, the optimal response of non-signatory countries reflects the interaction between three potentially opposing factors, the incentive to free-ride {{on the benefits of}} cooperation, the incentive to expand the demand of fossil fuels, and the incentive to adopt cleaner technologies introduced by the coalition. Using an Integrated Assessment Model with a game theoretic structure we find that cost-benefit considerations would lead OECD countries to undertake a moderate, but increasing abatement effort (in line with the pledges subscribed in Copenhagen). Even if emission reductions are moderate, OECD countries find it optimal to allocate part of their resources to energy R&D and investments in cleaner technologies. International spillovers of knowledge and technology diffusion then lead to the deployment of these technologies in non-signatory countries as well, reducing their emissions. When the OECD group follows more ambitious targets, such as 2050 emissions that are 50 % below 2005 levels, the benefits of technology externalities do not compensate the incentives deriving from the lower fossil fuels prices. This suggests that, when choosing their unilateral <b>climate</b> <b>objective,</b> cooperating countries should take into account the possibility to induce a virtuous behaviour in non-signatory countries. By looking at a two-phase negotiation set-up, we find that free-riding incentives spurred by more ambitious targets can be mitigated by means of credible commitments for developing countries in the second phase, as they would reduce lock-in in carbon intensive technologies.

The {{objective is to}} provide insights into the possible developments of international climate policies, viewed {{from the perspective of}} different images of the future with respect to socio-economic developments. How can various possible <b>climate</b> <b>objectives</b> (e. g. CO 2 stabilization at 450, 550, 650 and 750 ppm) be achieved in such different worlds? Options for solutions are evaluated using three groups of criteria: cost-effectiveness, sustainability, and feasibility. How well options score on these various criteria is strongly dependent on the world view. For example, in an image of the future in which socio-economic developments are characterized by sustainability concerns, in which there is broad support for international co-ordination of policies, and in which environmentally sound technologies are developed and transferred quickly, independent on climate policy, achieving climate targets is easier and cheaper. The report shows that there are clear leads for energy policy to support international climate policy. The report focuses on the global level, but sometimes zooms in on the European and Netherlands level. It provides conclusions with respect to so-called "robust" options, i. e. options which could {{play a key role in}} various world views as well as for various <b>climate</b> <b>objectives.</b> These options include energy conservation and efficiency as well as increased usage of natural gas and renewables (biomass on the short to medium term and other renewables on the longer-term).

Reprocessing improves data quality through more scrutiny and improved retrieval techniques for individual observing systems, while reanalysis merges many disparate observations with models through data assimilation, yet both aim to provide a climatology of Earth processes.

40|$|The Kyoto Protocol prescribes {{obligatory}} {{limits on}} the emission of greenhouse gases by the industrialized countries during the period 2008 - 2012. Six specific gases are covered. The Kyoto limits apply to an aggregate of emissions of the covered gases expressed in carbon dioxide (CO 2) equivalents, obtained by application of a "global warming potentials" (GWPs). In regard to concentrations, or stocks in the atmosphere, such equivalents are relatively unproblematic. But it is not obvious how to define CO 2 - equivalent emissions of different greenhouse gases, since such emissions affect not only the stock today but the stocks in the future, each with a different characteristic residence path through time (pulse response function). In constructing the GWP of a gas, the increments to radiative forcing at different times resulting from emission of an incremental emitted ton are simply summed out to some arbitrarily chosen time horizon. As has been recognized in the literature, the GWP measure has some serious defects. In the first place, {{it depends on the}} horizon one chooses to use in calculating it. Equally problematic, the GWP takes no account of the fact that increases in radiative forcing in the future are generally worse than increases in the present for two related reasons: They impose larger costs in the form of climate damage and they impose larger costs in the form of offsetting abatement then required to meet any given <b>climate</b> <b>objective.</b> A further shortcoming related to timing is that the GWP takes no account of the opportunity cost of capital.

Five climate regimes are explored: (1) the Brazilian Proposal, with differentiation of emission reductions based on countries' relative contribution to the global temperature increase realised. (2) Multi-Stage (MS) approach with a gradual {{increase in the number}} of Parties involved and their level of commitment according to participation and differentiation rules. (3) Per Capita Convergence approach (PCC) or 'Contraction & Convergence', with universal participation and a convergence of per capita emissions. (4) Preference Score (PS) approach, an allocation derived from a population weighted preference score voting for either grandfathering or per capita allocation. (5) Jacoby Rule (JR) approach with both participation thresholds and burden allocation based on per capita income. It is found that, on the short-term (2025) and under a emission profile for stabilising CO 2 concentrations at 450 ppmv (consistent with the EU-target), all approaches result into reductions of emission allowances of Annex I regions of about 20 to 60 percent compared to their 1990 emission levels. For Europe the reductions are 40 - 60 percent in 2025. At the same time, major non-Annex I regions (East Asia and South Asia) need to start participating in global emission reduction before the middle of this century, irrespective of the emission allocation approach and type of threshold chosen. In addition to the quantitative analysis the strengths and weaknesses of the various regimes were also explored in a qualitative way on the basis of a multi-criteria evaluation. Different types of criteria were identified: environmental, political, economic, technical and institutional and general policy criteria. Overall, the MS approach seems, in principle, to best satisfy the various types of criteria. However, other approaches could improve their performance by making adjustments in their design...|$|E

The LULUCF proposal regulates a "no debit" target for LULUCF (Forests and Agricultural soils), and regulates the accounting of any additional mitigation potential that might be expected of it. We find that the forest share of the LULUCF sector can achieve much more than what is in the regulation now. We elaborate a strategy for unlocking European Union (EU) forests and forest sector potential based on the concept of "climate smart forestry" (CSF).

Due to the close integration of the European electricity markets, the EU’s long-term transition to a low-carbon and energy-efficient economy has vast implications for the levels and structures of the wholesale electricity prices in Norway, which in turn determine the revenues for Norwegian wind power projects. Following the Norwegian government’s decision to withdraw Norway from the electricity certificate market after 2021, the long-term development of the wholesale electricity price {{and the costs of}} wind projects will solely determine whether it becomes profitable to develop onshore wind in Norway in 2030. I find that the EU’s climate and energy policies lead to higher and more volatile electricity prices in Norway under all scenarios, which particularly favors the development of wind power in Norway. In the Base Scenario of this analysis, Norway’s average electricity price increases to 44 €/MWh in 2030, while the market value factor of onshore wind is 101 % in all Norwegian bidding zones. By comparing the volume-weighted electricity prices for onshore wind with my estimates of the levelized cost of electricity for 25 onshore wind power projects in Norway, I find that onshore wind reaches grid parity in 2030. Finally, I find that the wind value factors in Norway range from 99 % to 103 %, for wind shares between 5. 8 % and 16 % of the Norwegian electricity mix across the four scenarios for 2030. This stands {{in stark contrast to the}} wind value factors in Sweden, Denmark and Germany, which drop to 94 %, 93 % and 82 % respectively in the scenario with high renewable energy development and low carbon prices in Europe.

To assess the scenarios of natural gas development up to 2050, we employ a global energy-economic model—the MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model. The results show that a cap-and-trade policy will enable China to achieve its climate mitigation goals, but will also reduce natural gas consumption. An integrated policy that uses a part of the carbon revenue obtained from the cap-and-trade system to subsidize natural gas use promotes natural gas consumption, resulting in a further reduction in coal use relative to the cap-and-trade policy case. The integrated policy has a very moderate welfare cost; however, it reduces air pollution and allows China to achieve both the <b>climate</b> <b>objective</b> and the natural gas promotion objective.

40|$|China has {{a goal of}} {{reducing}} carbon emissions. At the same time, China is currently targeting an increase in natural gas consumption {{as a part of}} broader national strategies to reduce the environmental (air pollution) impacts of the nation's energy system, which at present is still heavily reliant on coal. Natural gas is also being promoted in residential sector as a way to improve living standards. Chinese policy makers have recently launched nationwide gas pricing reform that links the natural gas price to oil prices to address natural gas supply shortages. My analysis of the pricing reform shows that it leads to a better predictability and transparency than the previous pricing regime. The reform also increased natural gas price that incentivized gas suppliers to produce and import more gas. However, there are also some limitations of the reform. First, it creates biased incentives that favor suppliers. Second, natural gas and oil have different supply and demand patterns and linking natural gas price to oil price may create distortions for natural gas use. The Chinese government should support a market-based natural gas pricing system because it will establish a better resource allocation system and improve welfare of China. To assess natural gas scenarios up to 2050, I use the EPPA model, which is a global energy-economic model where China is represented as a separate region. Based on my updates to the EPPA model to represent China's energy system and cost of technologies, three main policy scenarios are explored: the reference scenario, the cap-and-trade policy scenario, and the integrated policy scenario that coordinates the natural gas subsidy with economy-wide emission constraints. The results show that the cap-and-trade policy will reduce natural gas consumption while enabling China to achieve its climate goals. The integrated policy uses a part of the carbon revenue obtained from the cap-and-trade system and promotes natural gas consumption. The integrated policy results in a further reduction in coal use relative to the cap-and-trade policy case. Both the <b>climate</b> <b>objective</b> and the natural gas promotion objective can be achieved with the integrated policy. The integrated policy has a very moderate welfare cost while leading to a reduction in air pollution. The results are tested for their sensitivity to excluding the household sector from the cap-and-trade scheme, the cost of natural gas-based power generation, substitutability of fuels in final consumption, and the level of nuclear power generation in China. by Danwei Zhang.

A second key concept, the Deep Decarbonization Pathways (DDP), although less institutionalized, has been an effective tool to describe how these medium-term national targets were likely to fit into a longer-term perspective of global mitigation scenarios as studied in particular by the IPCC. The dialectical interaction between these two concepts should result in a more ambitious definition of national <b>climate</b> <b>objectives</b> and consequently in the design and implementation of stronger national climate policies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{world today}} {{is moving toward}} smart {{distribution}} grids and dispersed generation. Those tendencies are caused by different reasons. These include the decrease of fossil fuel consumption, EU directives of CO 2 emissions and <b>climate</b> <b>objectives</b> etc. Innovation and change in technology is a highly welcomed trend but one must not forget that there are drawbacks as well as benefits. One {{of the most important}} issues in future grids are the power quality and supply reliability issues. This paper describes how the change to dispersed generation and smart grids should look like and what are the main problems, that need quick and active solutions, so that future grids would be fully functional and reliable.

However, a key obstacle {{is the lack of}} financing schemes adapted to the existing building stock, whether public, commercial or residential. We propose a critical inventory of traditional and alterna-tive financing schemes. Case studies include schemes based on energy performance contracting, such as market facilitation in Berlin and EPC for {{deep renovation}} in in Latvia and France. Pooling buildings or bundling different building owners is pre-sented as a way to make projects more bankable. We then analyse third-party investment schemes which dis-connect the burden of debt from the building owner and attach it to the building, such as PACE schemes (US) and the Gree...|$|R
40|$|International audienceClimate change {{raises the}} issue of intergenerational equity, as catastrophes may unfairly affect some generations. As climate change threatens {{irreversible}} and dangerous impacts (IPCC, 2014), possibly leading to economic collapse, the tradeoff is no longer between present and future consumption, but between present consumption and the possible future extinction of civilization (Weitzman, 2009). This paper aims at identifying public policies that can reduce unfairness and strike a compromise between present and future generations when {{the potential impact of}} catastrophic climate change on the economy is accounted for. It explores the impact of inequality aversion and the impact of the attitudes towards population size on optimal climate policy when that catastrophic risk is accounted for. We use an integrated assessment model which simulates the future joint evolution of the economy and the climate. The Response model is a dynamic optimization model (Pottier et al., 2015), which belongs to the tradition of compact integrated assessment models such as DICE. It combines a Ramsey-like macroeconomic module and a climate module, and can be used to determine the optimal <b>climate</b> <b>objective</b> by comparing mitigation costs and avoided climate damages. We account for the risk of extinction due to climate change, first by assuming an exogenous probability of extinction, then by assuming a probability of extinction that depends on the temperature and on the level of economic output. We assume that the states of the world where people are wealthy will show enhanced resilience to climate damages, and will therefore face a lower probability of extinction under a given level of climate damages. Integrated assessment models can reveal the policy implications of various normative choices through the use of social welfare functions. Ideally, social welfare criteria should (i) account for inequality aversion (it should thus differ from the utilitarian criterion, which does not account for the distribution of utilities), (ii) satisfy the Pareto principle (i. e. it should account for the preferences of individuals) and (iii) be separable (i. e. the situation of past generations should not impact the evaluation). The ‘Expected Prioritarian Equally Distributed Equivalent’ (Fleurbaey and Zuber, 2014) accounts for the inequality aversion of the social planner and respects a weak form of Pareto, but is not separable under risky prospects (but we will not consider past generations in our analysis). This criterion includes a critical level of consumption which can be interpreted as the level of subsistence. In order to reveal the impact of inequality aversion on optimal climate policy, we consider various isoelastic functions φ, which translate the inequality aversion of the social planner, and various isoelastic functions u, which translate the risk aversion of the social planner. Inequality aversion here relates to the average consumption by individual at time t. Preliminary results using Response in the certain case (with no risk of extinction), and using the standard discounted utilitarian criterion, show that the optimal policy (i. e. the timing of optimal abatement) is identical for equal discount rates r = ρ + ηg, whatever the values of the pure time preference rate ρ and the degree of inequality aversion η. In the risky case, the degree of inequality aversion has {{a significant impact on the}} optimal climate policy. In order to reveal the impact of the attitudes towards population size N (which refers to the total number of individuals in all generations), welfare is weighted by the population size through αN, which is a bounded increasing sequence of N. In this case, the criterion gives priority to large populations...|$|E
40|$|Interest in the {{potential}} of smart grid to transform the way societies generate, distribute, and use electricity has increased dramatically over the past decade. A smarter grid could contribute to both climate change mitigation and adaptation by increasing low-carbon electricity production and enhancing system reliability and resilience. However, climate goals are not necessarily essential for smart grid. Climate change {{is only one of}} many considerations motivating innovation in electricity systems, and depending on the path of grid modernization, a future smart grid might do little to reduce, or could even exacerbate, risks associated with climate change. This paper identifies tensions within a shared smart grid vision and illustrates how competing societal priorities are influencing electricity system innovation. Co-existing but divergent priorities among key actors’ are mapped across two critical dimensions: centralized versus decentralized energy systems and radical versus incremental change. Understanding these tensions provides insights on how <b>climate</b> change <b>objectives</b> can be integrated to shape smart grid development. Electricity system change is context-specific and path-dependent, so specific strategies linking smart grid and climate change need to be developed at local, regional, and national levels. And while incremental improvements may bring short term gains, a radical transformation is needed to realize <b>climate</b> <b>objectives...</b>|$|R
40|$|India and China have {{established}} reputations {{in the international}} community for rapid economic development, innovative technology and exploitation of natural resources. Aside from the United States, China and India are the two major producers of carbon dioxide emissions in the world. At the same time China and India are two of the leading developing countries in promoting green energy and international <b>climate</b> change <b>objectives.</b> The local wind energy industry, as an alternative to replace fuel, witnessed a politically-sponsored take-off in both countries in terms of global market share as well as domestically-installed wind energy capacity in the late 2000 s. In particular, the current governments have taken the issue seriously on both the local and international levels. China and India ratified the Paris Agreement in 2015 and their national <b>climate</b> <b>objectives.</b> The puzzle of rapidly growing and politically supported wind energy sectors in these two countries in which environmental protection is strategically ignored in favour for economic growth has to be understood in the terms of the bigger picture of Beijing and New Delhi fostering external and internal legitimation by transforming norms and values to measureable outcomes. To do so, the paper illuminates the development of renewed legislative commitments for wind energy, the increasing external pressure for emission reductions, institutional changes, and demands for legitimation in India and China...|$|R
40|$|A new {{framework}} for analysing subnational policy-making {{is applied to}} climate governance in the 'twin towns' of Newcastle upon Tyne and Gelsenkirchen. Low levels of resource interdependence between central and local government in England mean that Newcastle Council has to rely heavily on other horizontal actors to achieve its <b>climate</b> <b>objectives.</b> In contrast, Gelsenkirchen Council receives substantial support from higher tiers of government, which gives it greater control over policymaking within the locality. Greater independence between tiers of government can {{make it more difficult}} for subnational bodies to adopt the kind of ambitious policies that may be necessary to combat wicked and/or significant policy challenges such as climate change. Instead, interdependent ‘joint-decision’ systems, which facilitate mutual support across tiers of government, may be better equipped to ensure that subnational public bodies have the capacity to act appropriately...|$|R

By building and testing representative optimization methodologies for low-carbon stock indices, this study investigates their ability to both (i) allow investors to hedge against climate-related financial risks and (ii) promote companies with higher contribution to the energy transition. The analysis is based on a large European stock index for which we benefit from a complete set of bottom-up calculated environmental indicators, including indirect and avoided carbon emissions figures. The results indicate that mainstream low-carbon indices methodologies fail to address the challenges they are based on and call for further improvements in order to align diversified financial instruments with ambitious <b>climate</b> <b>objectives...</b>|$|R
