First, this paper gives expressions of the stator flux and rotor current during the grid fault occurrence <b>and</b> <b>clearing</b> by solving the mathematical model of DFIG. The results of simulation conducted on a 1. 5 MW DFIG in the PSCAD/EMTDC verified the correctness of the derivation. Through qualitative analysis of stator flux expression, different fault durations will lead to the difference of transient during fault <b>clearing</b> <b>and</b> ignoring the process of fault clearing will lead to excessive crowbar resistance. Therefore, this paper optimizes the Crowbar resistance by considering both the process of grid fault <b>and</b> fault <b>clearing,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>presents</b> a Crowbar resistance adaptive setting principle based on Crowbar structure with parallel resistor. Simulation confirms this method can improve LVRT of wind farms.

60|$|THE {{forest of}} Montacute, {{in the north}} of England, is the name given to an {{extensive}} district, which in many parts offers no evidence of the propriety of its title. The land, especially during the last century, has been effectively <b>cleared,</b> <b>and</b> <b>presents,</b> in general, a champaign view; rich and rural, but far from picturesque. Over a wide expanse, the eye ranges on cornfields and rich hedgerows, many a sparkling spire, and many a merry windmill. In the extreme distance, on a clear day, may be discerned the blue hills of the Border, and towards the north the cultivated country ceases, and the dark form of the old forest spreads into the landscape. The traveller, however, who may be tempted to penetrate these sylvan recesses, will find much that is beautiful, and little that is savage. He will be struck by the capital road that winds among the groves of ancient oak, and the turfy and ferny wilderness which extends on each side, whence the deer gaze on him with haughty composure, as if conscious that he was an intruder into their kingdom of whom they need have no fear. As he advances, he observes the number of cross routes which branch off from the main road, and which, though of less dimensions, are equally remarkable for their masterly structure and compact condition.|$|R

25|$|The Court {{proceeded}} {{to reject the}} <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>present</b> danger test for the following reasons. To begin with, the test {{is linked to the}} United States' unique culture and constitutional position on freedom of speech, which does not represent the position in most Commonwealth jurisdictions and Singapore. In particular, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution {{is quite different from the}} corresponding provisions in the respective constitutions of Commonwealth jurisdictions. The Court cautioned that the United States approach should not be followed as it could result in possible abuse and negation of the right itself. Furthermore, the Court emphasized that the real risk test is already a weighty test which pays the correct attention to the balance between the right to freedom of speech and the possibility of its abuse.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{extremism}} and blindness of the Li Lisan line, the CCP suffered great losses. The Comintern sent Qu Qiubai and Zhou Enlai back to China to enforce its policies. The 28 Bolsheviks sent back by their mentors to take charge of the Chinese revolution took advantage of this opportunity to denounce Li. Xiang and Li still didn’t realize the <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>present</b> danger and criticized these young, immature students heavily. Then the Comintern sent a telegram recalling Li to Moscow to account for his policies. Pavel Mif went to Shanghai as an envoy of the Comintern too. Under Mif’s direction, the 4th Plenary Meeting of 6th National Congress of the CCP was held, Li was replaced by Mif’s protégé Wang Ming, and his associates Bolsheviks took other important jobs. Although Xiang sought to tender his resignation, the Comintern and senior leaders of the CCP, such as Qu and Zhou, thought Xiang’s symbolic value as a worker among the CCP leadership might still be helpful to the revolution, so they blocked his resignation.|$|E
