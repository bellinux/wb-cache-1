One contribution might be making them more moral, and that is fine. But finally, true morality cannot aim simply at the spread of morality.

2500|$|... "The <b>crucial</b> <b>question</b> {{was being}} debated {{was not what}} form sport should take, but whether {{competitive}} sport should exist {{at all in the}} new workers' state. After all, some revolutionaries argued, sports such as athletics, soccer, rowing, tennis and gymnastics were invented by the industrial bourgeoisie for their own diversion and character training for future careers as captains of industry and empire. It was thought perfectly natural by some after the Russian Revolution that a new pattern of recreation would emerge, reflecting the dominant values and needs in the new Socialist state... the two major groups that regarded sport as debasing workers' physical culture and inculcating non-socialist habits were known as the Hygienists and the Proletkul'tists (from 'proletarian culture')." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scholars broadly {{agree that}} the Torah {{is a product of}} the mid-Persian period, {{approximately}} 450-400 BCE, although some place its final form somewhat later, in the Hellenistic era. Many theories have been advanced to explain its composition, but two have been especially influential. The first of these, Persian Imperial authorisation, advanced by Peter Frei in 1985, holds that the Persian authorities required the Jews of Jerusalem to present a single body of law as the price of local autonomy. Frei's theory was deconstructed at an interdisciplinary symposium held in 2000, but the relationship between the Persian authorities and Jerusalem remains a <b>crucial</b> <b>question.</b> The second theory, sometimes called the [...] "Citizen-Temple Community", proposes that the Exodus story was composed to serve the needs of a post-exilic Jewish community organised around the Temple, which acted in effect as a bank for those who belonged to it. The Torah (the Exodus story) served as an [...] "identity card" [...] defining who belonged to this community (i.e., to Israel), thus reinforcing Israel's unity through its new institutions. Both explanations see the Exodus story as a [...] "charter myth" [...] for Israel, telling how Israel was delivered from slavery by Yahweh and therefore belongs to him through the covenant.|$|E
6000|$|Let me put a <b>crucial</b> <b>question.</b> Are the archaic {{markings}} on the disputed objects better, or worse, or much {{on a level}} with the general run of such undisputably ancient {{markings on}} large rocks, cists, and cairns in Scotland? I think the art in both cases is on the same low level. When the art on the disputed objects is more formal and precise, as on some shivered stones at Dunbuie, [...] "the stiffness of the lines and figures reminds one more of rule and compass than of the free-hand work of prehistoric artists." [...] {85c} The modern faker sometimes drew his marks [...] "free-hand," [...] and carelessly; sometimes his regularities suggest line and compass.|$|E

6000|$|... "Her {{purpose is}} left obscure. How easily, however, we see {{possibilities}} {{in a direction}} such as this. The father, perhaps a proud, handsome man, deserts the woman, and removes the child. The woman hates both for scorning her, but the father dies, or disappears, and is beyond her vengeance. Then the child, victim to the ills in his blood, creeps back to the opium den, not knowing his mother, but immediately recognized by her. She will make the child suffer {{for the sins of}} the father, who had destroyed her happiness. Such a theme was one which appealed to Dickens. It must not, however, be urged; and the <b>crucial</b> <b>question</b> after all is concerned with the opium woman as one of the unconscious instruments of justice, aiding with her trifle of circumstantial evidence the Nemesis awaiting Jasper.|$|E
60|$|Kropotkin {{has devoted}} {{much of his}} writing to {{technical}} questions of production. In ``Fields, Factories and Workshops'' and ``The Conquest of Bread'' he has set himself to prove that, if production were more scientific and better organized, a comparatively small amount of quite agreeable work would suffice to keep the whole population in comfort. Even assuming, as we probably must, that he somewhat exaggerates what is possible with our present scientific knowledge, it must nevertheless be conceded that his contentions contain a very large measure of truth. In attacking the subject of production he has shown that he knows what is the really <b>crucial</b> <b>question.</b> If civilization and progress are to be compatible with equality, {{it is necessary that}} equality should not involve long hours of painful toil for little more than the necessaries of life, since, where there is no leisure, art and science will die and all progress will become impossible. The objection which some feel to Socialism and Anarchism alike on this ground cannot be upheld in view of the possible productivity of labor.|$|E
6000|$|And now {{we come to}} the <b>crucial</b> <b>question</b> which truly concludes {{the whole}} matter. A {{reasonable}} agnostic, if he has happened to agree with me so far, may justly turn round and say, [...] "You have found a practical philosophy in the doctrine of the Fall; very well. You have found a side of democracy now dangerously neglected wisely asserted in Original Sin; all right. You have found a truth in the doctrine of hell; I congratulate you. You are convinced that worshippers of a personal God look outwards and are progressive; I congratulate them. But even supposing that those doctrines do include those truths, why cannot you take the truths and leave the doctrines? Granted that all modern society is trusting the rich too much because it does not allow for human weakness; granted that orthodox ages have had a great advantage because (believing in the Fall) they did allow for human weakness, why cannot you simply allow for human weakness without believing in the Fall? If you have discovered that the idea of damnation represents a healthy idea of danger, why can you not simply take the idea of danger and leave the idea of damnation? If you see clearly the kernel of common-sense in the nut of Christian orthodoxy, why cannot you simply take the kernel and leave the nut? Why cannot you (to use that cant phrase of the newspapers which I, as a highly scholarly agnostic, am a little ashamed of using) why cannot you simply take what is good in Christianity, what you can define as valuable, what you can comprehend, and leave all the rest, all the absolute dogmas that are in their nature incomprehensible?" [...] This is the real question; this is the last question; and it is a pleasure to try to answer it.|$|E

60|$|The <b>crucial</b> <b>question</b> now arises, What is Letter IV? If it be genuine (in substance), then, {{whatever}} {{the details of}} the Gowrie Conspiracy may have been, a conspiracy there was. This can only be denied by ignorance. If the enterprise fails, says the author of Letter IV, the plotters will lose their lives, their lands and houses will be ‘wrecked,’ their very names will be extirpated; and, in fact, James did threaten to extirpate the name of Ruthven. The letter deliberately means High Treason. The objection of Calderwood, and of all the Ruthven apologists, that Sprot confessed to having forged all the letters, we have shown to rest on lack of information. He said, at last, that he had forged many papers (some did not appear in Court in 1609), and that he forged three letters on the model of Letter IV. These three letters may either be I, III, and V; or III, V, and the torn letter. The case of Letter I is peculiar. Though it contains much that is in Letter IV, and might have been taken from it, the repetitions need not imply copying from Letter IV. Byron and others would say the same things, on the same day, to two or three correspondents. Letter IV is subsequent, as dated, to Letter I, and Logan might say to the Unknown, on July 18, what, after the announced interval of ten days, he said to Gowrie. Letter I contains this remark {{on the nature of the}} plot: ‘It is not far by’ (not unlike) ‘that form, with the like stratagem, whereof we had conference in Cap. h,’ which may be Capheaton, on the English side of the Border. Probably Logan often discussed ingenious ways of catching the King: new plots were hatched about once a month, as Cecil’s and the other correspondence of the age abundantly proves. The plot (the letter says) is like that in a Paduan story of a nobleman. The rest of the letter is identical with the matter of III, IV, and V. We cannot be sure whether Letter I is one of the three forged on IV or not.|$|E
