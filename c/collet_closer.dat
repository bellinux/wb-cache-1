5000|$|A toolroom lathe is a lathe {{optimized}} for toolroom work. It is essentially just a top-of-the-line center lathe, {{with all of}} the best optional features that may be omitted from less expensive models, such as a <b>collet</b> <b>closer,</b> taper attachment, and others. The bed of a toolroom lathe is generally wider than that of a standard centre lathe. There has also been an implication over the years of selective assembly and extra fitting, with every care taken in the building of a toolroom model to make it the smoothest-running, most-accurate version of the machine that can be built. However, within one brand, the quality difference between a regular model and its corresponding toolroom model depends on the builder and in some cases has been partly marketing psychology. For name-brand machine tool builders who made only high-quality tools, there wasn't necessarily any lack of quality in the base-model product for the [...] "luxury model" [...] to improve upon. In other cases, especially when comparing different brands, the quality differential between (1) an entry-level center lathe built to compete on price, and (2) a toolroom lathe meant to compete only on quality and not on price, can be objectively demonstrated by measuring TIR, vibration, etc. In any case, because of their fully ticked-off option list and (real or implied) higher quality, toolroom lathes are more expensive than entry-level center lathes.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{most other}} machine collet systems, 5C collets were {{developed}} primarily for work holding. Superficially similar to R8 collets, 5C collets have an external thread {{at the rear}} for drawing the <b>collet</b> <b>closed</b> and so work pieces may pass right through the collet and chuck (5C collets often also have an internal thread). Collets are also available to hold square stock. 5C collets have a limited closing range and so shank and collet diameters must be a close match.|$|R
50|$|In {{precision}} work, {{and in some}} {{classes of}} repetition work, cylindrical workpieces are usually held in a collet inserted into the spindle and secured either by a draw-bar, or by a <b>collet</b> <b>closing</b> cap on the spindle. Suitable collets may {{also be used to}} mount square or hexagonal workpieces. In precision toolmaking work such collets are usually of the draw-in variety, where, as the collet is tightened, the workpiece moves slightly back into the headstock, whereas for most repetition work the dead length variety is preferred, as this ensures that the position of the workpiece does not move as the collet is tightened.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{cosmopolitan}} {{life of the}} little-known English religious liberal, feminist and writer, Sophia Dobson Collet (1822 - 1894). It examines <b>Collet’s</b> <b>close</b> connection {{with members of the}} Brahmo Samaj, a movement founded in 1820 s Calcutta by Rammohun Roy to promote religious and social reform among Hindus. It shows her pivotal role in shaping a ‘cosmopolitan thought zone’ connecting Brahmos with British and American Unitarians, Transcendentalists, Theists and liberal Christians. Collet, if argues, enacted spiritual fellowship and a shared commitment to social reform within a respectful trans-racial and trans-faith affective community. Although she did not articulate an anti-imperial politics, she was committed to bridging the racialized divisions and hierarchies that characterised the ‘imperial social formation’ between Britain and India...|$|R
5000|$|One of the corollaries of the conical {{action is}} that collets may draw the work axially a slight amount as they <b>close.</b> <b>Collet</b> chuck systems that make no {{provision}} {{to prevent this}} draw-in are often called draw-in collet chucks, in contrast to systems which circumvent this movement, usually by pushing the tapered closing ring toward the collet rather than pulling the collet into the ring. Such non-draw-in types are often called [...] "dead-length" [...] or [...] "non-draw-in" [...] collet chucks. Draw-in {{is not always a}} problem, but avoiding it can be helpful on some work where failing to account for it might result in inaccuracy on part overall length, shoulder lengths, etc.|$|R
40|$|Cubatão, na Baixada Santista ficou caracterizada na década de 70 pelo caos {{ambiental}} propiciado pela instalação de dezenas de indústrias de base, sem planejamento territorial urbano adequado, sem estudo de impacto ambiental e com poucos equipamentos de controle de poluição do ar, solo e água. 	Dentre as indústrias sediadas no pólo industrial de Cubatão, a siderúrgica é responsável pela poluição das águas do estuário santista com a maior carga tóxica e 60 por cento de Fenol e 70 por cento de Metal Pesado, do total lançado por todas as indústrias do Polo. 	Este trabalho faz levantamento bibliográfico nacional e internacional sobre poluição hídrica de Siderúrgicas notadamente coquerias e mostra pesquisa de campo realizada em 13 campanhas, com amostragens junto a saída de efluentes no porto da empresa no estuário santista. 	Os resultados das amostras no ponto responsável pelos efluentes das fábricas de coqueria, laminação, aciaria e altos fornos, indicam toxicidade em 80 por cento das campanhas e mutagenicidade de moderada a alta em 75 por cento das amostras pesquisadas. 	Os resultados dos bioensaios utilizados, Microtox e Ames, respectivamente para toxicidade aguda e mutagenicidade, foram comparados aos dos últimos trabalhos realizados na COSIPA em 1986 e 1993, e aos relatórios do órgão controlador, CETESB de 1992 e 1994. 	Abrem - se discussões sobre os resultados que apontam o particulado presente na amostra como tóxico e mutagênico e induzem à proposta de recirculação e reaproveitamento total à jusante da empresa, de todas águas servidas descartadas no processo, a exemplo de países do 1 º Mundo que convivem com a produção do açoCubatão, {{situated in}} the low lying basin behind the porto f Santos {{on the coast of}} the state of São Paulo, Brazil, was notorious during the seventies for the environmental chaos produced by the dozens of basic industries and the lack of adequate urban planning, of studies of the environmental impact caused and with negligible resources for the control of pollution, whether of the air, soil or water. 	 Among the factories located in the industrial park of Cubatão, the steelworks is responsible for the largest toxic contribution as also for 60 per cent of the fenol and 70 per cent of the heavy metals of the overall total of these substances expelled by the factories of the industrial park. 	A survey of the literature, both national and international, dealing with the associated coke producing plants, was undertaken and presents field research carried out in the course of 13 campaigns giving the results of samples <b>colleted</b> <b>close</b> to the effluents in the company´s port in the Santos estuay. 	The results of the bioassays used to assess acute toxicity and mutagenicity, Microtox and Ames respectively, were compared with those found in the last researths undertaken by COSIPA in 1986 and 1993 and with those given in the reports of CETESB, the organ responsible for pollution control, in 1992 and 1994. 	The results which show that the particles presents in the samples were toxic and mutagenic are discussed and lay the foundation for the proposal that the totality of the water used shoud be returned to above the plant in such away as to permit its constant re use, in accordance with the example given by countries of the first world which have learnt to live with the nead for the production of stee...|$|R
