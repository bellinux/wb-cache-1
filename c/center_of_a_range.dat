40|$|Immune system defects {{are at the}} <b>center</b> <b>of</b> {{aging and}} <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> diseases. Here, we show that {{prolonged}} fasting reduces circulating IGF- 1 levels and PKA activity in various cell populations, leading to signal transduction changes in long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and niche cells that promote stress resistance, self-renewal, and lineage-balanced regeneration. Multiple cycles of fasting abated the immunosuppression and mortality caused by chemotherapy and reversed age-dependent myeloid-bias in mice, in agreement with preliminary data on the protection of lymphocytes from chemotoxicity in fasting patients. The proregenerative effects of fasting on stem cells were recapitulated by deficiencies in either IGF- 1 or PKA and blunted by exogenous IGF- 1. These findings link the reduced levels of IGF- 1 caused by fasting to PKA signaling and establish their crucial role in regulating hematopoietic stem cell protection, self-renewal, and regeneration...|$|R
40|$|The central-abundance {{hypothesis}} {{predicts that}} local adaptation is <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> {{the distance to}} the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> species' geographic <b>range.</b> To test this hypothesis, we gathered genomic diversity data from 49 populations, 646 individuals and 33, 464 SNPs of two wild relatives of maize, the teosintes Zea mays ssp. parviglumis and Zea. mays. ssp. mexicana. We examined the association between {{the distance to the}}ir climatic and geographic centroids and the enrichment of SNPs bearing signals of adaptation. We identified candidate adaptive SNPs in each population by combining neutrality tests and cline analyzes. By applying linear regression models, we found that the number of candidate SNPs is positively associated with niche suitability, while genetic diversity is reduced at the limits of the geographic distribution. Our results suggest that overall, populations located at the limit of the species' niches are adapting locally. We argue that local adaptation to this limit could initiate ecological speciation processes and facilitate adaptation to global chang...|$|R
40|$|Premise of research. Comparative {{studies of}} {{variation}} in the ecology and genetics of natural plant populations located at the limits and in the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> species <b>range</b> provide fundamental insights into the historical formation of species distribution patterns. Methodology. In this study, we quantify variation in the ecological niche and the expression <b>of</b> <b>a</b> floral polymorphism across {{the range of the}} Mediterranean geophyte Narcissus dubius Gouan. An exhaustive data set of known locations was compiled to distinguish groups of geographically central and peripheral populations in both Spain and France. These occur across a double climatic gradient. First, there is a gradient from a hot and dry Mediterranean climatic regime in eastern Spain to a milder Mediterranean climatic regime in southern France (lower maximum temperature and shorter summer drought). Second, there is a shift to a more continental climate in peripheral populations in inland Spain. We also modeled the current climatic niche and produced historical projections of potential glacial refugia for this species. Pivotal results. Peripheral populations showed consistent patterns of ecological niche differences with a less rupicolous ecology, more bare soil, and <b>a</b> higher cover <b>of</b> annual species. The ecological niche was more variable among peripheral populations than among central populations. Peripheral populations showed <b>a</b> repeated pattern <b>of</b> loss of stigma-height polymorphism and floral traits indicative <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reproductive strategy based on within-morph mating (probably selfing to assure seed set). Climate models indicate that contemporary peripheral populations (particularly in Spain) occur in areas that were least likely to have served as glacial refugia. Conclusions. Historical isolation and recolonization may have shaped contemporary patterns of ecological niche and reproductive trait variation among central and peripheral populations. © 2015 by The University of Chicago.

25|$|Conflicts between {{territorial}} Ugandan kob (K. k. thomasi) {{are usually}} settled with ritual and rarely actual fighting, whether in conventional territories or leks. A male usually needs only {{to walk in}} an erect posture towards the intruder to displace him. Neighboring males in leks {{do the same thing}} when they encounter their borders. Lek-holding white-eared kobs fight more often. Ugandan kob do sometimes sustain serious or fatal injuries, especially when control <b>of</b> <b>a</b> territory is at stake. Fights usually involve the combatants clashing, pressing and twisting each other with their horns head-on. However, a neighbor may attack from the rear or side. In lek clusters, the most dominant males occupy the <b>center.</b> The number <b>of</b> males in the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lek cluster <b>ranges</b> from three to seven, and their leks are the most clustered and they monopolize copulations with estrous females. Replacement of males in leks are much more common than in traditional territories, and most males are able to stay in the centre positions for only a day or two and rarely up to a week. This is largely due to intense competition and because most males leave their territories to feed and drink. Centrally located males reduce their chances of being replaced by leaving to feed during periods of relative calmness, yet they are not able to get enough food and water and have to eventually leave their leks. However, a male can gain enough energy after a week or two, and try to take back his position. At every lek cluster, males are always waiting take or retake a central lek. Males in traditional territories are able to stay {{for at least a year}} or two.|$|R

5000|$|Kob {{have few}} strong social bonds, but females {{can live in}} herds {{numbering}} in the thousands. They move more and are more social than territorial males. Females are {{at the front of}} the daily movements to water. Individuals learn where to go from their mothers. However, in larger herds, the females take their signals from other females. Males are also present in the migratory herds and follow the females. All-male herds may number in the hundreds and accompany females as they travel during dry season. [...] The social and reproductive organization of kob can vary. When in average or low population densities, males establish conventional territories and do not travel much. Adult males try to establish their territories in the best habitat available, which are inhabited by herds of females and their young. Herds are fluid and change in size and structure as individuals travel to find green vegetation. Other males, particularly young males, live in bachelor herds and are segregated from the females by the territorial males. On floodplains, where kob are densely populated, around two-thirds of the territorial males establish traditional territories, while the rest live in clustered territories known as leks. These clusters are sometimes smaller than a single traditional territory. Lek clusters are located on patches of short grass or bare ground within comparably tall grassland. As such, these territories have little to no value other than to the males that reside in them. About eight or 9 of every 10 females visit leks to mate, trading spacing and food for mating success. The kob tends to live in smaller herds consisting of 5 to 15 individual kob, but herds as many as 40+ have been observed. [...] Females and bachelor males live in large herds of up to 2000 and move through the leks, which are surrounded by high-quality grass and are near waterholes and commonly travelled routes. Conflicts between territorial Ugandan kob (K. k. thomasi) are usually settled with ritual and rarely actual fighting, whether in conventional territories or leks. A male usually needs only to walk in an erect posture towards the intruder to displace him. Neighboring males in leks do the same thing when they encounter their borders.
