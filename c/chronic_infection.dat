5|$|The {{infectious}} disease hepatitis C {{is caused by}} the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which affects the liver and is transmitted by blood-to-blood contact, or by exposure to another person's infected blood. The infection is often asymptomatic, but <b>chronic</b> <b>infection</b> can cause inflammation of the liver (chronic hepatitis). This condition can progress to scarring of the liver (fibrosis), and advanced scarring (cirrhosis). In some cases, those with cirrhosis go on to develop liver failure or liver cancer.|$|E

40|$|Background: Many chronic {{diseases}} and illnesses {{are associated with}} one or more <b>chronic</b> <b>infections,</b> dysfunction of mitochondria and reduced production of ATP. This results in fatigue and other symptoms that occur in most if not all chronic conditions and diseases. Methods: This is a review of the published literature on <b>chronic</b> <b>infections</b> in neurodegenerative diseases and fatiguing illnesses that are also typified by mitochondrial dysfunction. This contribution also reviews the use of natural supplements to enhance mitochondrial function and reduce the effects of <b>chronic</b> <b>infections</b> to improve overall function in various chronic illnesses. Results: Mitochondrial function can be enhanced by the use of various natural supplements, notably Lipid Replacement Therapy (LRT) using glyerolphospholipids and other mitochondrial supplements. In various chronic illnesses that are characterized by the presence of <b>chronic</b> <b>infections,</b> such as intracellular bacteria (Mycoplasma, Borrelia, Chlamydia and other infections) and viruses, LRT has proven useful in multiple clinical trials. For example, in clinical studies on chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia syndrome and other chronic fatiguing illnesses where a large majority of patients have <b>chronic</b> <b>infections,</b> LRT significantly reduced fatigue by 35 - 43...|$|R

5|$|When {{properly}} treated, {{people with}} malaria can usually expect a complete recovery. However, severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days. In {{the most severe}} cases of the disease, fatality rates can reach 20%, even with intensive care and treatment. Over the longer term, developmental impairments have been documented in children who have suffered episodes of severe malaria. <b>Chronic</b> <b>infection</b> without severe disease can occur in an immune-deficiency syndrome associated with a decreased responsiveness to Salmonella bacteria and the Epstein–Barr virus.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on <b>chronic</b> <b>infection</b> typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated {{blood vessels in the}} esophagus and stomach.|$|E
5|$|Medical student Georges Garoyan {{published}} a thesis on Calment {{when she was}} 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with athropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, <b>chronic</b> <b>infection</b> or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed {{the presence of the}} DR1 allele, common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.|$|E
40|$|<b>Chronic</b> <b>infections</b> with {{persistent}} pathogens such as helminths, mycobacteria, Plasmodium, and hepatitis viruses affect {{more than}} a third of the human population and are associated with increased susceptibility to other pathogens as well as reduced vaccine efficacy. Although these observations suggest an impact of <b>chronic</b> <b>infections</b> in modulating immunity to unrelated antigens, little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms. Here, we summarize evidence of the most prevalent infections affecting immunity to unrelated pathogens and vaccines, and discuss potential mechanisms of how different bystander <b>chronic</b> <b>infections</b> might impact immune responses. We suggest that bystander <b>chronic</b> <b>infections</b> affect different stages of host responses and may impact transmission and recognition of other pathogens, innate immune responses, priming and differentiation of adaptive effector responses, as well as the development and maintenance of immunological memory. Further understanding of the immunological effects of coinfection should provide opportunities to enhance vaccine efficacy and control of infectious diseases...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Common {{variable}} immunodeficiency {{represents the}} largest group of primary immunodeficiency patients. The variable clinical manifestations include an increased susceptibility to <b>chronic</b> <b>infections,</b> granulomatous disease and the lymphoproliferative predisposition to develop lymphoma. This review discusses the latest insights into common variable immunodeficiency and uses common variable immunodeficiency as a model to examine the links between immunodeficiency and <b>chronic</b> <b>infections</b> in causing lymphoma. RECENT FINDINGS: Newly identified disease genes within the common variable immunodeficiency population, have advanced the understanding of human immunodeficiency and the molecular basis of B-cell biology. Refined laboratory techniques have better defined this heterogeneous condition by classifying the underlying B-cell and T-cell abnormalities. New sensitive methods have also identified the presence of persistent infections that {{may play a role in}} the development of lymphoma. SUMMARY: There are several reasons for an increased risk of lymphoma in common variable immunodeficiency patients. These include genetics, immune dysregulation, radiosensitivity and <b>chronic</b> <b>infections</b> such as Helicobacter pylori, human herpes virus type 8 and cytomegalovirus. <b>Chronic</b> <b>infections</b> may enhance the development of lymphoma in an antigen specific manner. The interaction between <b>chronic</b> <b>infections</b> and the development of lymphoma is still unclear but studies to clarify this may lead to prevention measures and lymphoma reduction strategies...|$|R

40|$|Natural killer {{cells are}} {{important}} effector lymphocytes of the innate immune system, playing critical roles in antitumor and anti-infection host defense.

In many tumors or <b>chronic</b> <b>infections,</b> multiple mechanisms {{might contribute to}} the exhaustion of NK cells, such as dysregulated NK cell receptors signaling, as well as suppressive effects by regulatory cells or soluble factors within the microenvironment. Better understanding of the characteristics, {{as well as the}} underlying mechanisms of NK cell exhaustion, not only should increase our understanding of the basic biology of NK cells but also could reveal novel NK cell-based antitumor/infection targets.

25|$|Screening {{consists}} of a blood test that detects hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).

25|$|Unlike {{hepatitis}} B, {{most cases}} of hepatitis C lead to <b>chronic</b> <b>infection.</b> Hepatitis C {{is the second}} most common cause of cirrhosis in the US (second to alcoholic hepatitis). In the 1970s and 1980s, blood transfusions were a major factor in spreading hepatitis C virus.

25|$|Vertical {{transmission}} {{is a significant}} contributor of new HBV cases each year, with 35–50% of transmission from mother to neonate in endemic countries.
