5|$|A {{total of}} six venues—the Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range, the Indira Gandhi Sports Complex, the Jawaharlal Nehru Sports Complex, the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, the Siri Fort Sports Complex and the Yamuna Sports Complex—had varying {{capacities}} {{as reflected in the}} table as they <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> their allocated sport(s) in more than one facility. For example, the Yamuna Sports Complex's archery facility <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> 1,500 while its facility for table tennis <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> 4,297.|$|E
5|$|The narrow pavement, {{which could}} {{accommodate}} {{a maximum of}} 12,000 per day, was transformed into an enormous plaza that <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> in excess of 400,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{modified}} castle {{was completed}} by 1808, and held eight 24-pounder (11kg) guns along the outer wall, a gun {{on the roof of}} the southern bastion, and another on top of the keep itself. The new castle <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> a garrison of 40 men.|$|E

5|$|Before the Taylor Report {{demanded that}} the stadium be all-seated, Easter Road had vast banks of {{terracing}} on three sides, which meant that it <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> crowds in excess of 60,000. The record attendance of 65,860, {{which is also a}} record for a football match played in Edinburgh, was set by an Edinburgh derby played on 2 January 1950. Such vast crowds were drawn by the success of the Famous Five.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the main}} bailey walls lies the stable block, now ruined {{but with a}} visible cobble floor. The stables and {{the north and west}} sides of the castle were {{protected}} by another, smaller curtain wall, but this is now largely ruined. Accounts suggest that the original stables <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> around 60horses, although by the 17th century they had been expanded to accommodate more.|$|E
5|$|The Kop {{was built}} in 1906 due to the high turnout for matches and was called the Oakfield Road Embankment initially. Its first game was on 1 September 1906 when the home side beat Stoke City 1–0. In 1906 the banked stand {{at one end of}} the ground was {{formally}} renamed the Spion Kop after a hill in KwaZulu-Natal. The hill was the site of the Battle of Spion Kop in the Second Boer War, where over 300 men of the Lancashire Regiment died, many of them from Liverpool. At its peak, the stand <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> 28,000 spectators and was one of the largest single-tier stands in the world. Many stadia in England had stands named after Spion Kop, but Anfield's was the largest of them at the time; it <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> more supportersc than some entire football grounds.|$|E

5|$|The {{calculator}} was {{powered by}} a Texas Instruments TMC1802NC, a metal oxide semiconductor integrated circuit with 7000 transistors. This CPU normally consumes 350 milliwatts, but by pulsing the power this requirement was reduced to 20 milliwatts. It was discovered that an early prototype continued to work if the batteries were disconnected and then reapplied quickly enough, as the capacitors in the circuit <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> a charge {{for up to five}} seconds.|$|E
5|$|Árbenz {{was asked}} to fill a vacant {{teaching}} position at the academy in 1937. Árbenz taught {{a wide range of}} subjects, including military matters, history, and physics. He was promoted to captain six years later, and placed in charge of the entire corps of cadets. His position was the third highest in the academy and was {{considered one of the most}} prestigious positions a young officer <b>could</b> <b>hold.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Michigan gained statehood, {{governors}} {{held the}} office for a two-year term, until the 1963 Michigan Constitution changed the term to four years. The number of times an individual <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> the office was unlimited until a 1992 constitutional amendment imposed a lifetime term limit of two four-year governorships. The longest-serving governor in Michigan's history was William Milliken, who was promoted from lieutenant governor after Governor George W. Romney resigned, then was elected to three further successive terms.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the need}} to defend against these incursions, the Byzantines could not afford to use all their forces against the Persians. Heraclius sent an envoy to the Avar Khagan, saying that the Byzantines would pay a tribute in return for the Avars to {{withdraw}} north of the Danube. The Khagan replied by asking for a meeting on 5 June 623, at Heraclea in Thrace, where the Avar army was located; Heraclius agreed to this meeting, coming with his royal court. The Khagan, however, put horsemen en route to Heraclea to ambush and capture Heraclius, so they <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> him for ransom.|$|E
5|$|Between 1869 and 1870, {{the society}} {{completed}} {{construction of a}} new two-story brick building on Lot 56 at the corner of West Main and North High Streets known as Literary Hall, where it <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> its meetings and reassemble the remaining volumes from its original library. Literary Hall was built upon the former location of the shuttered Bank of the South Branch of the Potomac. In addition to the 400 volumes that were initially recovered following the war, the society recovered several more volumes from its original library, and set about purchasing new books; the restored library was reopened with about 700 volumes.|$|E
5|$|Born in Rome in 1783, Pistrucci studied {{briefly with}} other artists before {{striking}} {{out on his}} own at age 15. He became prominent as a cameo carver and was patronised by royalty. In 1815, he moved to Britain, where he would live for {{most of the rest of}} his life. His talent brought him to the attention of notables including William Wellesley-Pole, the Master of the Mint. Pole engaged Pistrucci to design new coinage, including the sovereign, which was first issued in 1817 to mixed reactions. Although Pole probably promised Pistrucci the post of Chief Engraver, the position could not be awarded as only a British subject <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> it. This slight became a long-term grievance for Pistrucci.|$|E

50|$|Geologists have {{estimated}} that the mine <b>could</b> potentially <b>hold</b> 2,100,000 troy ounces of gold, of which 25% is silver content.|$|R
5|$|By the 1880s and 1890s, {{both the}} power of naval {{artillery}} and the speed of warships had further increased, leading to further investment in the castle between 1888 and 1893. The keep's magazine, which <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> up to 2,250 shells, was reinforced with concrete and the south bastion of the old castle was filled in with shingle and concrete for additional protection. New 6-pounder (2.7kg) quick-firing guns were installed in a battery {{on the end of}} the east wing, supported by machine guns, to enable them to target fast moving vessels, particularly the new torpedo boats. Further emplacements for 12-pounder (5.4kg) guns followed, including one on the top of the keep.|$|E
5|$|Constructed {{and opened}} in 1906 {{to replace the}} Muntz Street ground, which had become too small to meet the club's needs, the {{original}} St Andrew's <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> an estimated 75,000 spectators, housed in one grandstand and a large uncovered terrace. The attendance record, variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341, was set at a 1939 FA Cup tie against Everton. During the Second World War, St Andrew's suffered bomb damage and the grandstand, housing a temporary fire station, burned down in an accidental fire. In the 1950s, the club replaced the stand and installed floodlights, and later erected a second small stand and roofed over the open terraces, but there were few further changes.|$|E
5|$|Dewhurst {{continued}} to play for Trinidad between 1923 and 1926, although, owing to his business commitments, {{he was unable to}} play in every game. In 1926 he played against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which was touring the West Indies, for both Trinidad and a West Indies team. He passed fifty three times against the touring team, and such was his improvement as a batsman that critics suggested he <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> a place in the West Indies team for his batting alone. However, Dewhurst did not play another first-class match until 1930.|$|E
60|$|Felix laughed shortly. He was {{lighting}} a cigarette, but his hand trembled {{so that he}} <b>could</b> scarcely <b>hold</b> the match.|$|R

5|$|Ernst {{depended}} on {{his brother and}} the Catholic barons in the Cathedral Chapter to hold the territory he acquired. In 1585, Munster, Paderborn, and Osnabrück succumbed to Ferdinand's energetic pursuit in the eastern regions of the electorate, and a short time later, Minden. With their help, Ernst <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> Bonn. Support {{from the city of}} Cologne itself was also secure. To oust Gebhard, though, Ernst ultimately had to appeal for aid to Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, who commanded Spanish forces in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Highbury <b>could</b> <b>hold</b> {{more than}} 60,000 spectators at its peak, {{and had a}} {{capacity}} of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium {{in time for the}} 1993–94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators. This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate additional advertising boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley, which could house more than 70,000 spectators.|$|E
5|$|However, Osborn had {{no control}} over his Super-Adaptoid abilities; he would {{automatically}} absorb the powers of any superhuman he touched, even if he did not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his body <b>could</b> <b>hold,</b> as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all touched him at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry, resulting in him going into a coma. After he regained consciousness, these powers were apparently burnt out, returning him to his Goblin-level strength instead.|$|E
