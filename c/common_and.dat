5|$|Adult birds may {{be killed}} by cats, little owls and sparrowhawks, and eggs and nestlings are taken by magpies, jays, and, where present, grey squirrels. As with other {{passerine}} birds, parasites are <b>common,</b> <b>and</b> include endoparasites, such as the nematode Splendidofilaria (Avifilaria) mavis whose specific name mavis derives from this thrush. A Russian study of blood parasites showed that all the fieldfares, redwings and song thrushes sampled carried haematozoans, particularly Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma. Ixodes ticks are also <b>common,</b> <b>and</b> can carry pathogens, including tick-borne encephalitis in forested areas {{of central and eastern}} Europe and Russia, and, more widely, Borrelia bacteria. Some species of Borrelia cause Lyme disease, and ground-feeding birds like the song thrush may act as a reservoir for the disease.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Commons</b> <b>and</b> Anticommons {{problems}} are {{the consequence of}} symmetric structural departures from a unified conception of property. In this paper, we endeavor to provide a dual model of property, where <b>commons</b> <b>and</b> anticommons {{problems are}} the consequence {{of a lack of}} conformity between use and exclusion rights. While <b>Commons</b> <b>and</b> Anticommons problems are symmetric in this sense, they are associated with asymmetric transaction costs. The paper formulates a hypothesis of legal rules for promoting unity in property and suggests a list of possible areas of application. 1...|$|R
