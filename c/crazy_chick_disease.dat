5000|$|On February 15, 1961, in Manhattan, Wilson {{was injured}} in a shooting. It is said the real story behind this {{incident}} {{is that one of}} his girlfriends, Juanita Jones, shot and wounded him in a jealous rage when he returned to his Manhattan apartment with another woman, fashion model Harlean Harris, an ex-girlfriend of Sam Cooke's. Wilson's management supposedly concocted a story to protect Wilson's reputation; that Jones was an obsessed fan who had threatened to shoot herself, and that Wilson's intervention resulted in him being shot. Wilson was shot in the stomach: The bullet would result in the loss of a kidney, and lodged too close to his spine to be operated on. In early 1975, during an interview with author Arnold Shaw, Wilson maintained it actually was a zealous fan whom he did not know that shot him. [...] "We also had some trouble in 1961.

The study suggested an effective vaccination schedule of Baby <b>Chick</b> Ranikhet <b>Disease</b> Vaccine in <b>chicks</b> of vaccinated and nonvaccinated origin. The optimum age for vaccination of chicks of vaccinated and nonvaccinated origin were determined by inoculating vaccine following two different vaccination schedules. In one schedule chicks of group C of vaccinated origin and group F of nonvaccinated origin were vaccinated primarily at day 4 and was boosted at day 19 and in another schedule the chicks of group D of vaccinated origin were vaccinated once at day 14 without giving booster dose. It was found that maternally derived antibody passed over from the parents to progeny chicks and remain protective for the chicks of group A of vaccinated origin until 18 days of age and the chicks of group B of nonvaccinated origin until 5 days of age. This maternally derived antibody was retained particularly up to 24 days and 11 days in chicks of group A and B obtained from parent vaccinated and nonvaccinated flock respectively. Chicks of group C primarily vaccinated with Baby <b>Chick</b> Ranikhet <b>Disease</b> Vaccine revealed slightly positive effect to rise of antibody during their gradual increase of age due to the presence of high level of antibody at the time of primary vaccination where as in chicks of group F antibody level was increasing impetuously due to the low level of antibody at the time of vaccination.

In group A (n= 50), vaccination was performed twice with BCRDV at 2 and 21 days of age through intraocular route (i/o) followed by once with RDV at 60 -day of age through intramuscular (i/m) route. Group B (n= 50) was kept as unvaccinated control. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was evaluated by measuring the serum HI antibody titers at 1 -, 20 -, 36 -, and 76 -day of age, while the vaccine efficacy was examined by a challenge infection experiment with a velogenic field isolate of NDV as well as passive protection test. It was observed that the maternal antibody titers of the unvaccinated control group B gradually declined from day 1 to day 76 of age. Conversely, after primary and secondary vaccination with BCRDV, the levels of serum HI titer slightly increased in vaccinated group A compared with those in control group B. Finally administration of RDV resulted in a sharp increase in HI titer, leading to protection from challenge infection with virulent field virus as well as passive protection test.

40|$|The Belgian PCB/dioxin {{incident}} is a food contamination {{that occurred in}} Belgium in January 1999 when a tank of recycled fats used to produce animal feeds was accidentally contaminated by approximately 100 L of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) oil containing 50 kg PCBs expressed as {{the sum of the}} seven markers, 1 g (TEQ) dioxins (PCDD/Fs) and 2 g toxic equivalent (TEQ) dioxin-like PCBs. The incident was discovered when a poultry poisoning resembling the classic <b>chick</b> edema <b>disease</b> broke out in several farms that had received contaminated feeds. The delay in making public this incident resulted in a major political and food crisis and caused much concern in the population. We review here the health risk evaluations that were made after this incident and we assess the likelihood of the different scenarios by taking into account recent data on the real scale of the contamination and on the dioxin body burden of the general population in Belgium. These new data confirm that the incident was too limited in time and in scale to have increased the PCB/dioxin body burden of the general population at large, a conclusion supported by a survey of dioxin levels in blood conducted at the end of 1999. Only farmers in poultry farms affected by the incident (about 30 farms) and having regularly consumed their own products could have increased their PCB/dioxin body burden. It is unlikely, however, that these farmers could have increased their PCB/dioxin body burden above levels prevailing in the 1980 s or now found in communities regularly consuming seafood...|$|R

In this study twelve chickens were grouped into vaccinated broilers (D 14 and D 28) which had received vaccines first at D 3 of age and a booster dose given at D 13; and non-vaccinated broilers (D 1) which had not been vaccinated. In this study, {{it was observed that}} the frequency and distribution of Igs-positive cells were higher at D 14 and at D 28 rather than D 1. Among Igs-positive cells, the IgG-positive cells were significantly higher than IgM and IgA-positive cells in the Harderian gland of D 14 and D 28 groups of chickens, however, in dayold chickens, the frequency of IgM-positive cells in this gland were greater. In the cecal tonsil, the frequency and distribution of IgG-positive cells were significantly higher than IgA- and IgM-positive cells both at D 14 and D 28 ages of chicken. On the other hand, in day-old chickens, the frequency and distribution of IgA-positive cells were insignificantly greater, followed by IgM and IgG-positive cells. In the trachea, few immunoglobulin-containing plasma cells were distributed in the subepithelial layer. IgM-positive cells were higher followed by IgG and IgA-positive cells in the trachea in D 14 and D 28 groups of chickens. In the same organ, IgG-positive plasma cells were greater than IgA and IgM-positive cells at one-day old. When the data for Harderian gland, cecal tonsil and trachea were compared statistically, it was observed that Igs-positive cells were statistically more common in cecal tonsils in day old chickens, and with the advancement of age, Igs-positive cells were found more in the Harderian gland.

40|$|The Belgian PCB {{incident}} {{occurred at the}} end of January 1999 when a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) contaminated with dioxins was accidentally added to a stock of recycled fat used in the production of animal feeds. Although signs of poultry poisoning were noticed by February, 1999, the source and the extent of the contamination were discovered only in May 1999, when it appeared that more than 2500 farms could have been supplied with contaminated feeds. This resulted in a major food crisis, which rapidly extended to the whole country and could be resolved only by the implementation of a large PCB/dioxin food monitoring program. Screening for PCB contamination was based on the determination of the seven PCB markers. When PCB concentrations exceeded the tolerance levels of 0. 1 (milk), 0. 2 (poultry, bovine, and pig meat), or 1 (animal feed) microg/g fat, dioxins (17 PCDD/Fs congeners) were also determined. At the end of December 1999, the database contained the results of more than 55, 000 PCB and 500 dioxin analyses. The study of PCB levels and profiles in contaminated feeds delivered to poultry or pig farms confirmed that the Belgian PCB incident was due to a single source of PCB oil introduced into the food chain {{at the end of}} January 1999. This PCB oil had a congeners pattern closely matched to a mixture of Aroclor 1260 / 1254 in the proportion 75 / 25. The total amount of PCBs added to recycled fats was estimated at 50 kg (sum of the seven markers) or approximately 150 kg total PCBs, which corresponds to about 100 liters of PCB oil. This PCB mixture contained about 1 g TEQ dioxins (more than 90 - contributed by PCDFs) and about 2 g TEQ dioxin-like PCBs. The proportions of PCB 52 and 101 congeners were fairly constant in animal feeds, excluding the possibility of secondary contamination due to fat recycling from contaminated animals. The highest concentrations of PCBs and dioxins were found in poultry and especially in the reproduction animals (hens and chicks), which showed the classical manifestations of <b>chick</b> edema <b>disease.</b> The pigs were also affected but to a lesser extent and no sign of intoxication was observed. The study of PCB/dioxin patterns and of the PCB:dioxin ratios revealed major differences in the metabolism of these compounds by farm animals. Whereas the PCBs:dioxins ratio was fairly constant in all poultry products with a mean value similar to that found in contaminated feeds (50, 000), in pigs this ratio was both much higher and more variable (values up to 10, 000, 000), reflecting a faster elimination of dioxins than PCBs in these animals. These metabolic differences also emerged from the PCB and dioxin patterns which were altered much more in pigs than in poultry. Although the most contaminated food products (chicken meat) had PCB and dioxin levels more than 100 times above maximal recommended values, it is unlikely that this incident could have caused adverse effects in the general population of Belgium. A doubling of the PCB and dioxin burden of the young adult population would require the consumption of, respectively, 10 and 20 highly contaminated meals. In view of the very limited proportion of the poultry chain effectively contaminated during the incident (around 2 %), such an extreme scenario was quite improbable for the general population except perhaps for farmers consuming their own products. But even in that case, it would have meant going back to the levels in the 1980 s or attaining the body burden of subjects regularly eating contaminated seafood. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Shortage of pullet {{supply and}} high {{mortality}} of local <b>chicks</b> arising from <b>diseases</b> and inadequate feed {{were the main}} challenges identified through a rapid diagnostic survey on the poultry value chain in Dale. Accordingly, women group-based commercial pullet rearing as an input for smallholder poultry production was initiated by the Office of Agriculture and Rural Development (OoARD) and IPMS. To develop the program, a credit scheme was initiated by the Regional Rural Finance Fund Administration, using IPMS’s credit innovation funds. With assistance of OoARD, eighty women subdivided into five (village) groups, collectively purchased 4000 day-old chicks (50 /woman) and other inputs such as feed, vaccines, hay box brooder and watering equipment. The women were trained and developed their skills through their group structures. The required vaccinations were also given by the women themselves {{under the auspices of}} the group structures that taught them how to make best use of available vaccine size (500 doses/vial). After 4 – 5 months, 3470 pullets survived and were kept by the women or sold to others for egg production. Empirical results show that: i) the group approach helped to improve linkages, communication, and access to knowledge, technology, finance, inputs (day-old chicks and feed), veterinary service, and market; ii) the groups were able to successfully produce and supply pullets thus making an additional income of Ethiopian birr (ETB) 1 833 /hh; iii) the approach stimulates growing demand for the 5 months-old pullets, especially by government/donor financed programs. While being technically and economically viable, the system requires institutional upgrading so as to ensure sustainability of input supply (chicks, feed and vaccine/drugs) at the nearest market both for pullet and egg producers. The commitment shown by WoARD to provide technical backstopping in all aspects of poultry production also leaves much to be desired. These are crucial at least for the first few cycles, while more emphasis should be given to promoting improved local birds. As the follow-up studies on subsequent egg production showed, considerable attention needs to be paid to building the capacity of poultry farmers to engage in semi-commercial egg production, since egg production was still far below its potential. The study also shows that a difference of as high as 35 % existed between egg production level by households who had purchased the pullets privately and households who had received the pullets through food security funded projects in Dale area.
