40|$|An {{inherent}} characteristic of concrete is {{the tendency for}} it to change volume. If this volume change is restrained, residual tensile stresses will be induced, ultimately leading to crack formation. Concrete placed in slabs-on-grade applications, i. e., sidewalks, roadways, and parking lots, are especially susceptible to cracking. Welded-wire fabric is commonly used to provide reinforcement and <b>control</b> the <b>cracking</b> behavior of concrete. However, {{in the last several}} decades, the use of fiber-reinforced concrete and shrinkage-reducing admixtures have gained acceptance as an alternative to <b>crack</b> <b>controlling</b> measures. ^ Current standard laboratory testing procedures for quantifying the shrinkage and cracking tendency of concrete provide a convenient means to evaluate these effects using small scale specimens. These small scale test methods do not fully represent the behavior of concrete in the field. This thesis describes a large scale, restrained slab testing system that is designed to simulate full scale performance under standard drying conditions. ^ The large scale slab system allows for a direct comparison between welded wire fabric, fiber reinforcement, and shrinkage-reducing admixtures in their ability to <b>control</b> <b>crack</b> formation and transfer of tensile stresses across the crack. The restrained slab data of this research was able to show the benefits of fiberreinforced concrete and shrinkage reducing admixtures over the welded wire fabric.

40|$|The <b>cracking</b> <b>control</b> {{of plain}} {{concrete}} slabs on soil foundation requires {{the execution of}} joints with mechanisms of load transfer between adjacent panels. These joints increase the construction costs and, often, {{are the source of}} local damage and loss of service performance. Slabs reinforced with steel wire mesh have been used in order to increase the load carrying capacity and to enhance the <b>cracking</b> <b>control.</b> However, the use of this conventional reinforcement increases the costs, mainly due to labor time spent on the arrangement and positioning of the reinforcement. Fiber reinforced concrete is a recent material well fitted for applications in industrial floors on soil foundation.

The fatigue, impact and flexural strength are significantly improved when steel fibers are added to the concrete mix.

The aim is to prove that under the action of Characteristic design loads (un-factored), and/or whilst applying certain (un-factored) magnitudes of imposed deformations, settlements, or vibrations, or temperature gradients etc. the structural behavior complies with, and does not exceed, the SLS design criteria values, specified in the relevant standard in force.

40|$|Purpose – To {{evaluate}} manufacturers' {{claims that}} structural polypropylene fibres provide satisfactory <b>crack</b> <b>control</b> reinforcement {{and compare the}} findings against steel fabric used as <b>crack</b> <b>control</b> in screeds where tensile forces are likely to occur. Design/methodology/approach – The procedure used to provide load, deflection data, toughness indices and residual strength factors was compliant with ASTM C 1018 - 97 and in part ASTM C 78 - 02 to define first crack toughness and first crack strength. Findings – A 142 steel fabric reinforcement as used in screeds was more effective in producing toughness and residual strength when directly compared {{with the performance of}} structural polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete. Where polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete did have an advantage over the steel reinforced concrete was when I 20 was exceeded and the deflection and crack width was excessive. Steel fabric tended to fail and/or the screed material failed either prior to or in excess of I 20, whereas the fibre reinforced concrete held together albeit at a very much reduced load transfer when compared with steel fabric. Practical implications – If the forces to be encountered through expansion or contraction are small, then, due to the small distances between the fibres redistributing the stress and minimising the cracks within the concrete matrix, polypropylene fibres may be suitable for <b>crack</b> <b>control</b> when directly compared with A 142 fabric reinforcement.
