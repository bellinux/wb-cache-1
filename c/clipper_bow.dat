5|$|Admiral Scheer {{underwent}} a refit while her sister ships {{set out on}} commerce raiding operations in the Atlantic. Admiral Scheer was modified during {{the early months of}} 1940, including the installation of a new, raked <b>clipper</b> <b>bow.</b> The heavy command tower was replaced with a lighter structure, and she was reclassified as a heavy cruiser. Additional anti-aircraft guns were also installed, along with updated radar equipment. On 19–20 July RAF bombers attacked Admiral Scheer and the battleship , though they failed to score any hits. On 27 July, the ship was pronounced ready for service.|$|E
5|$|The Kriegsmarine {{considered}} the ships {{to be good}} sea boats, with a slight roll. As built, they were wet in a head sea, though this was significantly improved by the installation of a <b>clipper</b> <b>bow</b> in 1940–1941. The ships were highly maneuverable, particularly when the maneuvering setting for the diesel engines was used, in which half of the engines for each shaft were run in reverse. The ships heeled over up to 13degrees with the rudder hard over. The low stern was wet in a stern sea, and equipment stored there was frequently lost overboard.|$|E
5|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} from transverse and longitudinal steel frames, and {{were divided into}} nine watertight compartments, with a double bottom that extended for 60percent {{of the length of}} the hull. Both vessels had two pole masts fitted with spotting tops. Nautilus and Albatross had different bows; Nautilus received a <b>clipper</b> <b>bow,</b> while Albatross had a ram bow like contemporary German light cruisers. Albatross also had a higher forecastle that extended {{to the base of the}} main mast, while Nautilus was completed with a superstructure deck that began just aft of the fore mast.|$|E
50|$|Aberdeen had <b>clipper</b> <b>bows</b> {{and three}} barque-rigged masts. There was {{accommodation}} for 45 first and 650 third class passengers.|$|R
50|$|Cyrene was a {{steamboat}} that operated initially on Puget Sound {{and later}} on Lake Washington from 1891 to about 1912. Cyrene and another similar vessel Xanthus were somewhat unusual in that they had <b>clipper</b> <b>bows</b> and were both originally built as yachts.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>clipper</b> type <b>bow</b> of the pinas {{often carried}} a carved figurehead called [...] "Gobel" [...] and the transom stern was raked aft and reached pretty high {{up above the}} waterline. The pinas had a well defined sheer and was a {{seaworthy}} vessel.|$|R
5|$|Admiral Hipper {{was ordered}} by the Kriegsmarine from the Blohm & Voss {{shipyard}} in Hamburg. Her keel was laid on 6 July 1935, under construction number 246. The ship was launched on 6 February 1937, and was completed on 29 April 1939, {{the day she was}} commissioned into the German fleet. The Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine, Großadmiral (Grand Admiral) Erich Raeder, who had been Franz von Hipper's chief of staff during World War I, gave the christening speech and his wife Erika Raeder performed the christening. As built, the ship had a straight stem, though after her launch this was replaced with a <b>clipper</b> <b>bow.</b> A raked funnel cap was also installed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{built in}} {{response}} to Gloire, the Warriors had a very different operational concept from the French ship, which was meant to replace wooden ships of the line. The Warriors were designed by Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates and were not intended {{to stand in the}} line of battle, as the Admiralty was uncertain about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two- and three-deck ships of the line. Unlike Gloire, they were planned to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought to their own advantage. In contrast to Gloires square profile, Warrior has a <b>clipper</b> <b>bow,</b> but she is twice as long as a typical clipper ship.|$|E
5|$|Kapitän zur See (Captain at Sea) Hellmuth Heye {{was given}} {{command of the}} ship at her {{commissioning}}. After her commissioning in April 1939, Admiral Hipper steamed into the Baltic Sea to conduct training maneuvers. The ship also made port calls to various Baltic ports, including cities in Estonia and Sweden. In August, the ship conducted live fire drills in the Baltic. At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the ship was still conducting gunnery trials. She was briefly used to patrol the Baltic, {{but she did not}} see combat, and was quickly returned to training exercises. In November 1939, the ship returned to the Blohm & Voss dockyard for modifications; these included the replacement of the straight stem with a <b>clipper</b> <b>bow</b> and the installation of the funnel cap.|$|E
50|$|These {{boats are}} also called Perahu (Malay: boat) pinas Golok, to {{distinguish}} them from other types built {{with a straight}} stem and without a beak (figurehead) the pinas Dogar. Golok,(Malay: cleaver/machet) or sword with a convex cutting edge, refers to the curved, <b>clipper</b> like <b>bow.</b>|$|R
500|$|The three Deutschland-class ships varied {{slightly}} in dimensions. All three ships were [...] long at the waterline, and as built, [...] long overall.

For some historians, the Rainbow was the first true [...] "Yankee clipper". She was built in 1845 to a new design by the American naval architect John Willis Griffiths {{who is said to}} have based his design on the owner's previous ship Ann McKim. This type of vessel had been in demand for the China trade, but they were rather small. From the experience gained in the service of these first clippers, the builder soon found the changes that were necessary in the design for the building of larger and faster ships demanded in 1850 for the California, China and Australia clipper routes.|$|R
25|$|The {{design of}} the two Yodo-class cruisers {{differed}} noticeably. Not only was Mogami larger and heavier than Yodo, it also had a straight raked bow with three smokestacks, compared to Yodo which had a <b>clipper</b> <b>bow</b> and two smokestacks. Another {{significant difference between the}} two ships was their propulsion systems, while Yodo had a conventional two shaft, four cylinder reciprocating (VTE) engines with four Miyabara boilers, Mogami has the distinction of being the first Parsons-type turbine-powered vessel in the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|E

Seydlitz and Lützow were [...] long overall, with beams of [...] and drafts of [...] standard and [...] at full load.|$|E
500|$|The {{two ships}} had {{different}} bow designs for comparison purposes; Settsus <b>clipper</b> <b>bow</b> was longer than Kawachis vertical stem.

50|$|The three Deutschland-class ships varied {{slightly}} in dimensions. All three ships were 181.70 m long at the waterline, and as built, 186 m long overall. Deutschland and Admiral Scheer had <b>clipper</b> <b>bows</b> installed in 1940-1941; their overall length was increased to 187.90 m. Deutschland had {{a beam of}} 20.69 m, Admiral Scheers beam was 21.34 m, while Admiral Graf Spees was 21.65 m. Deutschland and Admiral Scheer had a standard draft of 5.78 m and a full-load draft of 7.25 m. Admiral Graf Spees draft was 5.80 m and 7.34 m, respectively. The displacement of the three ships increased over the class. Standard displacement grew from 10600 LT for Deutschland to 11550 LT for Admiral Scheer and 12340 LT for Admiral Graf Spee. The ships' full load displacements were significantly higher, at 14290 LT for Deutschland, 13660 LT for Admiral Scheer, and 16020 LT for Admiral Graf Spee. The ships were officially stated to be within the 10000 LT limit of the Treaty of Versailles, however.|$|R
5000|$|The General Board was {{convinced}} that the major sea powers would jump to 15 in or 16-inch naval guns as a main armament and asked for designs based on the 16-inch gun. A series of designs was laid out with the last being a design with 8 16-inch guns on the 31000 LT design of the earlier Pennsylvania design. No one reviewing the design was at all happy with it. Strangely enough, this would except in small details, become the blueprint of the Colorado-class battleships. On July 30, the Secretary of the Navy ordered that, except for the inclusion of individual slides for the main guns, <b>clipper</b> <b>bows</b> for improved seakeeping and, in New Mexico, an experimental turbo-electric propulsion system, the New Mexico class would be a reproduction of the preceding Pennsylvania class. A third ship, Idaho, was added with funding from the proceeds of the sale of the obsolescent pre-dreadnoughts [...] and [...] to Greece.|$|R
5000|$|Officially, Ship Characteristics Board Program 27 proper {{referred}} to the completion of , left unfinished at war's end, to a heavily revised design; reconstructions of earlier ships were programs SCB-27A and 27C. The SCB-27 modernization was very extensive, requiring some two years for each carrier. To handle the much heavier, faster aircraft of the early jet-era, the flight deck structure was significantly reinforced, able to support aircraft weighing up to 52000 lb, namely the North American AJ Savage. Stronger and larger elevators, much more powerful catapults, and new Mk 5 arresting gear were installed. The original four twin 5-inch/38 gun mounts were removed, clearing the flight deck of guns. The new five-inch gun battery consisted of eight weapons, two on each quarter beside the flight deck. Twin 3-inch/50 gun mounts replaced the 40 mm guns, offering much greater effectiveness {{through the use of}} proximity fuzed ammunition. The reconstruction eliminated the difference between [...] "short-hull" [...] and [...] "long-hull" [...] ships; all now had similar <b>clipper</b> <b>bows.</b>|$|R
500|$|The Colorados were {{extremely}} similar overall to the Tennessees, with a [...] overall length and a beam at the waterline of [...] They displaced [...] at normal load and [...] at deep load {{and had a}} draft of [...] Like the Tennessees, they were designed with a <b>clipper</b> <b>bow</b> to make the ships dryer in rough weather. One improvement over previous classes was {{the location of the}} secondary battery in the superstructure rather than the upper hull, where it had proved to be excessively wet.|$|E
500|$|The Nautilus {{class was}} a pair of minelaying cruisers built by the Imperial German Navy. [...] was laid down in 1905 and {{completed}} by 1907, and [...] was laid down in 1907, and completed in 1908. Both ships were built by the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen, but to slightly different designs. Nautilus had a <b>clipper</b> <b>bow,</b> while Albatross had a bow similar to contemporary German light cruisers.

500|$|The Victoria Louise {{class of}} {{protected}} cruisers {{was the last}} class of ships of that type built for the German Imperial Navy. The class design introduced the combined <b>clipper</b> and ram <b>bow</b> and the blocky sides that typified later German armoured cruisers. The class comprised five vessels, , the lead ship, , , , and [...] The ships were laid down in 1895–1896, and were launched in 1897–1898 and commissioned into the fleet over the following year.|$|R
50|$|Extreme {{clippers}} {{remained in}} vogue {{only a few}} years. Owing to the depth and sharpness of their floors they lacked stability, and in consequence of the sharpness of the ends those parts did not have buoyancy enough to sustain their own weight—a fact {{which led to the}} straining and weakening of the vessel. A change was made in 1855 by joining to the <b>clipper</b> top, <b>bow,</b> and stern the fuller bottom of the old-fashioned freighting ship. The midship section, or widest part of the ship, was also moved farther aft, so as to be only a trifle forward of the middle of the ship's length, and the vessel was made to float substantially on an even keel. That style of vessel remains in use to the present day 1884, although capacity is now the chief aim in American sailing ships rather than speed.|$|R
500|$|Niobe {{was among}} the ships {{permitted}} by the Treaty of Versailles {{after the end of}} the war, and so she continued on in service with the newly reorganized Reichsmarine. During this period, she was significantly modernized; her old ram bow was replaced with a <b>clipper</b> <b>bow.</b> Her old 10.5cm SK L/40 guns were replaced with newer SK L/45 guns in U-boat mountings and two [...] torpedo tubes in deck-mounted launchers were installed. On 24 June 1925, Niobe was stricken from the naval register and sold to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia).|$|E

500|$|In 1916, Amazone was {{disarmed}} {{and used}} as a basic training ship for naval cadets. The following year, she was converted into a barracks ship, based in Kiel, a role she filled {{until the end of}} the war. The Treaty of Versailles permitted Germany to retain six light cruisers, and Amazone was among those kept in service of the newly reorganized Reichsmarine. She was modernized at the Reichsmarine Werft in Wilhelmshaven in 19211923, and had her ram bow replaced with a <b>clipper</b> <b>bow.</b> She was also rearmed with ten 10.5cm SK L/45 guns in U-boat mountings and two [...] torpedo tubes in deck launchers.|$|E
5000|$|By 1930, {{looking back}} on the <b>clipper</b> era, the <b>bow</b> {{appeared}} much less shocking than it did at the time. Cutler writes, “The Rainbow represented a certain departure from fast-sailing models of her day but she was {{far from being a}} radically new type ... However, her appearance as she gradually took shape on the stocks aroused so much criticism that her owners delayed her completion for more than a year. She was, perhaps, the first ship of the extremely hollow bow type, and {{in spite of the fact}} that very similar lines had been incorporated in pilot boats for years, old wiseacres grumbled that her bows were 'turned inside out.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|CGS Earl Grey {{was built}} in 1909 in Barrow-in-Furness for the Saint Lawrence River winter service as an [...] "icebreaking freight and {{passenger}} steamer". Its engine was just 30% less powerful than the engine of Yermak, the largest true icebreaker of the period, although Yermak was slower due to a bulky ice-crushing layout. Earl Grey was equipped with a <b>clipper</b> style Stanley <b>bow,</b> giving it a yacht-like appearance and its owners claimed {{it to be the}} [...] "First Canadian ice fighting machine". Later Russian crew members praised its living quarter luxuries but scorned the substandard shower room. The ship also rolled excessively, even on relatively calm seas.|$|R
500|$|The Victoria Louise {{class was}} the last class of {{protected}} cruisers built for the German Navy. The class design introduced the combined <b>clipper</b> and ram <b>bow</b> and the blocky sides that typified later German armored cruisers. The class comprised five vessels: the lead ship , , , , and [...] The ships were laid down in 1895 and 1896, launched in 1897 and 1898, and commissioned into the fleet over the following year. Problems with the Niclausse boilers installed on Vineta prompted the Navy to standardize boiler types in future warships; from then on, only Schulz-Thornycroft or Marine type boilers would be used. All five ships were armed with a main battery of two 21 cm SK L/40 guns and eight 15 cm SK L/40 guns.|$|R
500|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} with longitudinal and transverse steel frames; {{a single layer}} of wood planks {{were used for the}} hull. A later of Muntz metal sheathing extended up to [...] above the waterline to protect against fouling of the hull. This sheathing was later removed from Victoria Louise, Hertha, and Freya. The hull was divided into twelve watertight compartments, which were later reduced to eleven, with the exception of Freya. The hull also incorporated a double bottom that extended for 60percent of the length of the hull. The ships' design set a precedent for later armored cruisers, with large, bulky sides and a combined <b>clipper</b> <b>bow</b> and ram.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{her sister}} ship, , Settsu had a <b>clipper</b> <b>bow</b> {{that made her}} [...] longer than her sister. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draft of [...] She {{displaced}} [...] at normal load. Her crew ranged from 999 to 1100 officers and enlisted men.

The turbines were rated at a total of [...] for a design speed of [...] She carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of [...] at a speed of [...]|$|E
500|$|Blücher {{was ordered}} by the Kriegsmarine from the Deutsche Werke {{shipyard}} in Kiel. Her keel was laid on 15 August 1936, under construction number 246. The ship was launched on 8 June 1937, and was completed slightly over two years later, on 20 September 1939, {{the day she was}} commissioned into the German fleet. The commanding admiral of the Marinestation der Ostsee (Baltic Naval Station), Admiral Conrad Albrecht, gave the christening speech. Frau Erdmann, widow of Fregattenkapitän Alexander Erdmann, former commander of , performed the christening. As built, the ship had a straight stem, though after her launch this was replaced with a <b>clipper</b> <b>bow</b> increasing the overall length to [...] A raked funnel cap was also installed.|$|E
500|$|The {{design for}} the ships of the Magdeburg class was {{prepared}} in 1908–1909. The design incorporated a number of innovations, including a new longitudinal frame system in the hull, the development of which delayed construction by three to four years. The hull form was also redesigned to improve efficiency, and a new <b>clipper</b> <b>bow</b> was used instead of the old cruiser ram bow. They were the first German light cruisers to incorporate an armored belt at the waterline; this increased {{the strength of the}} hull and became standard practice in warship construction for decades. The quarterdeck was cut down to provide [...] a location to drop mines. All of these features became standard for subsequent German cruiser designs.|$|E
500|$|Ancona was {{commissioned}} into the Italian Navy on 6 May 1925. She was modified extensively in 19281929, during which a fixed aircraft catapult {{was installed in}} the bow. The modifications required a longer bow to fit the catapult, so a longer <b>clipper</b> <b>bow</b> was installed. This was to test the utility of a fixed catapult on the bow, an arrangement that would later {{be used in the}} [...] and es of heavy cruisers built in the 1920s and 1930s. Ancona thereafter served in secondary roles until 1932 when she was placed in reserve in Taranto. She was stricken on 11 March 1937 and was retained for some time as a source of spare parts for the other two ex-German cruisers in Italian service, Bari and Taranto. Ancona was eventually broken up for scrap {{by the end of the}} 1930s.|$|E
500|$|Bismarck {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Blohm & Voss {{shipyard}} on 1 July 1936. The ship was assigned construction number 509, and the contract name Ersatz Hannover, {{as a replacement for}} the old battleship [...] The ship was launched on 14 February 1939, with Adolf Hitler in attendance. The granddaughter of the ship's namesake, Otto von Bismarck, christened the ship. As with other German capital ships, Bismarck was originally built with a straight bow. Experiences with other ships revealed the necessity of a <b>clipper</b> <b>bow,</b> which was installed on Bismarck during the fitting-out process. The ship was commissioned into the fleet on 24 August 1940, with Kapitän zur See Ernst Lindemann in command. Three weeks later, the ship left Hamburg for trials in the Baltic Sea, before returning in December for final fitting-out work. Further trials and tests were conducted in the Baltic in March and April; Bismarck was placed on active status the following month.|$|E
