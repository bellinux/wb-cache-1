40|$|ABSTRACT. Experience in the Soviet Union and Alaska {{indicates}} that the major poten-tial conflicts between domestic reindeer and their wild counterparts (both caribou and reindeer are of the same species, Rangifer tarandus) are: (I) Loss of domestic reindeer to wild herds. Although this can be reduced under <b>close</b> <b>herding,</b> {{it is still a}} serious problem wherever wild reindeer or caribou and domestic reindeer coexist. Domestic reindeer joining wild herds appear to have low breeding success and therefore probably have little genetic influence on the larger wild populations. (2) Competition for forage between domestic reindeer and wild herds, which is primarily restricted to the winter range. Herded reindeer feed more intensively than the wild, free-ranging animals and therefore their effect on range forage is greater. (3) Diseases and parasites may be readily transmitted between domestic reindeer and their wild counterparts. However, most diseases and parasites common to the species are endemic to both wild and domestic herds. RÉSUMÉ. L’exptrience de l’Union SoviCtique et de l’Alaska montre que les conflits majeurs qui peuvent survenir entre le renne domestique et sa contrepartie sauvage (le caribou et le renne appartiennent A la même esptce, Rangifer tarandus) sont de trois ordres...|$|E
30|$|The {{perception}} of apathy demonstrated by owners and herders alike could also {{arise from the}} subsistence nature of extensive livestock farming in Botswana, which may not necessarily require intensive herd management. It is a low-input, low-output system. A similar observation has been made by McGahey (2011) in Botswana’s Ngamiland, where there was positive attitude among some livestock owners and herders towards veterinary cordon fences particularly in curbing stock theft and preventing cattle from straying as far as Namibia. People are aware that their livestock cannot go beyond the cordon fences (barring permeability due to wildlife and anthropogenic damage), and so, they let their stock graze freely within the area without <b>close</b> <b>herding</b> or no herding at all. This is even more so during dry seasons when water sources become key focal points where livestock congregate, thereby reducing herding labour demand as well as time to round up the animals. Even in instances where animals do go astray, herders and owners will search for them {{within the confines of}} the cordon fences first, before raising an alarm. And since the last FMD outbreaks in the study area were recorded in 2002 and 2003, it is natural for people in general to let their guard down once a perceived threat has passed.|$|E
40|$|To {{address the}} problem of {{restricted}} access to grazing by cattle in wet season in the Sahel, a grazing trial was conducted to study the effect of duration of grazing and grazing method on cattle nutrition and performance. Twenty-four intact steers weighing 259 kg (SD ¼ 62) were randomly allotted to four treatments to study the effect of the combination of grazing method (tethering and <b>close</b> <b>herding)</b> and grazing duration (6 and 9 h per day) on diet selection, faecal output, forage intake, grazing behaviour and weight changes in the wet season. Three esophageally fistulated steers were used in a cross-over design to sample diet selected by tethered and herded animals. Extrusa samples from esophageally fistulated steers and faecal output from intact steers were collected in weeks 6 and 9 of the experiment and grazing behaviour of the intact steers was observed in week 6. Tethered animals selected diets of lower organic matter digestibility (OMD) but tethering had no significant effect on crude protein. Close herded steers consistently consumed more forage than those tethered in both periods. Both grazing method and duration had significant effect on ingestion rate by the steers. Tethered steers had lower average daily gain than those herded. The results demonstrate that the common practice of tethering sedentary cattle in the wet season in the southern Sahel in West Africa reduces forage intake and consequently average daily gai...|$|E

This study gathered expert opinion from farmers, veterinarians, consultants, academics, and government and industry representatives on the practicality and effectiveness of different biosecurity measures on dairy farms. The study used best-worst scaling, a technique that allows for greater discrimination between choices and avoids the variability in interpretation associated with other methods, such as Likert scales and ranking methods. Keeping a <b>closed</b> <b>herd</b> was rated as the most effective measure overall, and maintaining regular contact with the veterinarian was the most practical measure. Measures relating to knowledge, planning, and veterinary involvement; buying-in practices; and quarantine and treatment scored highly for effectiveness overall. Measures relating to visitors, equipment, pest control, and hygiene scored much lower for effectiveness. Overall, measures relating to direct animal-to-animal contact scored much higher for effectiveness than measures relating to indirect disease transmission. Some of the most effective measures were also rated as the least practical, such as keeping a <b>closed</b> <b>herd</b> and avoiding nose-to-nose contact between contiguous animals, suggesting that real barriers exist for farmers when implementing biosecurity measures on dairy farms. We observed heterogeneity in expert opinion on biosecurity measures; for example, veterinarians rated the effectiveness of consulting the veterinarian on biosecurity significantly more highly than dairy farmers, suggesting a greater need for veterinarians to promote their services on-farm. Still, both groups rated it as a practical measure, suggesting that the farmer-veterinarian relationship holds some advantages for the promotion of biosecurity...|$|R

The results showed that identical viruses were isolated within a herd during outbreaks and that viruses from recurrent infections varied by up to 11 % in sequence even in <b>closed</b> <b>herds.</b> It is possible that a quasispecies variant swarm of BRSV persisted {{in some of the}} calves in each herd and that a new and different highly fit virus type (master and consensus sequence) became dominant and spread from a single animal in connection with each new outbreak.

The current Dutch certification-and-monitoring schemes {{were compared with}} 11 alternative schemes in which individual and pooled fecal culture, ELISA, Johnin-intradermal test and gamma-IFN ELISA were used, varying the test frequency, tested age group and number of tested animals. On reaching the 'Map-free' status with the standard certification scheme, 11 % of the simulated herds were not truly Map-free. Therefore, the designation 'Map-free' should be changed into, for instance, 'low-risk Map'. In the most-attractive alternative certification scheme, the 'Map-free' status was reached after four herd examinations (at 2 -year intervals) consisting of serial testing of all cattle > or = 2 years of age with a pooled fecal culture and individual fecal culture of positive pools. This scheme resulted in lower total and annual discounted costs and a lower animal-level prevalence at reaching the 'Map-free' status compared to the standard scheme, assuming {{that there was no}} new introduction of the infection. Schemes to monitor the 'Map-free' status were compared, assuming that this status was reached with the standard certification scheme. In comparison to the standard monitoring scheme, none of the alternative monitoring schemes resulted in both a lower animal-level prevalence of undetected pre-existing Map infections in <b>closed</b> <b>herds,</b> and lower median annual discounted costs.

Under typical management conditions one persistently infected animal poses a real threat to a herd, and the prospect of the herd becoming infection free in a 10 -year period without intervention is remote. Seroconverting animals are found to be an important source of infection in herds with few immune animals. The increased loss of PI calves is likely to restrict the numbers of PI animals in a herd, and loss of immunity is important since it increases the possibility of a PI calf being born...|$|R
5000|$|Some breeders keep {{horses in}} {{semi-natural}} conditions, {{with a single}} stallion amongst a group of mares. This {{is referred to as}} [...] "pasture breeding."
