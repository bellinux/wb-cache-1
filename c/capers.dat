5|$|The film began full {{production}} in 2002. While most projects of its type took 18–24 months to complete, the development team completed {{the film in}} 13months. The project's budget was later estimated as being between $3.5 to $5million. In addition to Creative <b>Capers,</b> Taiwanese studio CGCG created most of the animation: at the time, overseas outsourcing was a rarity for CGI movies. By the end of production, the film ran to 77minutes of raw footage. At this stage, 310 Studios {{was brought in to}} handle post production, which mostly entailed cutting the film's length down by 7minutes. According to 310 Studios president Billy Jones, the hardest part of this was deciding which pieces needed to be cut, as they were impressed with everything that had been produced. 310 Studios also created the opening title and ending credit sequences. Lego also partnered with Miramax to distribute the film, along with developing a future full feature-length theatrical film.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objective: Nowadays, {{the general}} {{interest}} in complementary medicine and traditional medicine is increasing. Traditional Iranian medicine {{is one of}} the oldest forms of complementary medicine. The aim of this study is to introduce <b>Caper</b> drug combinations and their application in the treatment of diseases based on traditional medicine sources, with the goal of establishing complementary studies for the development of effective drugs in the treatment of multiple diseases. Method: A review of the traditional medicine books on <b>Caper</b> drug products and the introduction of <b>Caper</b> properties in new findings has been done in the present study.
