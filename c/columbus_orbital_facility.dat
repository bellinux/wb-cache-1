50|$|The International Space Station (ISS) External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) {{maintains}} an equilibrium when the ISS environment or heat loads exceed {{the capabilities of}} the Passive Thermal Control System (PTCS). Note Elements of the PTCS are external surface materials, insulation such as Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI), or Heat Pipes. The EATCS provides heat rejection capabilities for all the U.S. pressurized modules, the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), the <b>Columbus</b> <b>Orbital</b> <b>Facility</b> (COF), and the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 Trusses. The EATCS consists of two independent Loops (Loop A & Loop B), which both use mechanically pumped fluid state ammonia in closed-loop circuits. The EATCS is capable of rejecting up to 70 kW, and provides a substantial upgrade in heat rejection capacity from the 14 kW capability of the Early External Active Thermal Control System (EEATCS) via the Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS), which was launched on STS-105 and installed onto the P6 Truss.|$|E

40|$|Measurement of the {{microgravity}} acceleration {{environment on}} the International Space Station {{has been accomplished}} by two accelerometer systems since 2001. The Microgravity Acceleration Measurement System records the quasi-steady microgravity environment, including the influences of aerodynamic drag, vehicle rotation, and venting effects. Measurement of the vibratory/transient regime, comprised of vehicle, crew, and equipment disturbances, has been accomplished by the Space Acceleration Measurement System-II. Until {{the arrival of the}} <b>Columbus</b> <b>Orbital</b> <b>Facility</b> and the Japanese Experiment Module, the location of these sensors, and therefore, the measurement of the microgravity acceleration environment, has been limited to within the United States Laboratory. Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency has developed a vibratory acceleration measurement system called the Microgravity Measurement Apparatus which will be deployed within the Japanese Experiment Module to make distributed measurements of the Japanese Experiment Module's vibratory acceleration environment. Two Space Acceleration Measurement System sensors from the United States Laboratory will be re-deployed to support vibratory acceleration data measurement within the <b>Columbus</b> <b>Orbital</b> <b>Facility.</b> The additional measurement opportunities resulting from the arrival of these new laboratories allows Principal Investigators with facilities located in these International Space Station research laboratories to obtain microgravity acceleration data in support of their sensitive experiments. The Principal Investigator Microgravity Services project, at NASA Glenn Research Center, in Cleveland, Ohio, has supported acceleration measurement systems and the microgravity scientific community through the processing, characterization, distribution, and archival of the microgravity acceleration data obtained from the International Space Station acceleration measurement systems. This paper summarizes the PIMS capabilities available to the International Space Station scientific community, introduces plans for extending microgravity analysis results to the newly arrived scientific laboratories, and provides summary information for known microgravity environment disturbers...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} unsolved {{problems}} in space projects, where human beings are involved, is the impossibility of simulating on the ground the effects of microgravity on astronauts' operability in space. [1] In particular, this is traceable {{in the performance of}} work activities, such as performing physiological scientific experiments. [2] This paper focuses on a study of the gap between the two operational scenarios: the ground test simulation and the in-flight space performance of complex physiological experiments. The major differences between the two operational scenarios are highlighted, and recommendations for improvement are suggested. The main finding of this paper is that, in order to make experiment performance not only possible but also easy and efficient, it is necessary to consider all human factors involved. With this perspective, the author's aim has been to find an effective way to consider all human factors of the ground and space operational conditions. For this purpose, a set of analysis and simulation tools were selected and tested while studying the <b>Columbus</b> <b>Orbital</b> <b>Facility's</b> physiological experiments. These tools enabled the author to build operational scenarios where spatial, temporal and procedural considerations could be studied simultaneously, so that operational problems were highlighted.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of object-oriented software affect type and relevance of faults.

This paper proposes a new technique for interclass testing, that is, the problem of deriving test cases for suitably exercising interactions among clusters of classes. The proposed technique uses data-flow analysis for deriving a suitable set of test case specifications for interclass testing. The paper then shows how to automatically generate feasible test cases that satisfy the derived specifications using symbolic execution and automated deduction.

In this context, the main area of application now emerging is the scientific missions domain.

40|$|The ESA {{communication}} network for decentralized remote telescience during the Spacelab mission IML- 2, called Interconnection Ground Subnetwork (IGS), provided data, voice conferencing, video distribution/conferencing and high rate data services to 5 remote user centers in Europe. The combination of services allowed the experimenters {{to interact with}} their experiments as they would normally do from the Payload Operations Control Center (POCC) at MSFC. In addition, to enhance their science results, {{they were able to}} make use of reference facilities and computing resources in their home laboratory, which typically are not available in the POCC. Characteristics of the IML- 2 communications implementation were the adaptation to the different user needs based on modular service capabilities of IGS and the cost optimization for the connectivity. This was achieved by using a combination of traditional leased lines, satellite based VSAT connectivity and N-ISDN according to the simulation and mission schedule for each remote site. The central management system of IGS allows minimization of staffing and the involvement of communications personnel at the remote sites. The successful operation of IGS for IML- 2 as a precursor network for the <b>Columbus</b> <b>Orbital</b> <b>Facility</b> (COF) has proven the concept for communications to support the operation of the COF decentralized scenario...|$|E
