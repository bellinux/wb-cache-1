He became Chancellor of Scotland by 30 January 1301. Balmyle's pension for being Chancellor {{was to be}} paid by Arbroath Abbey, for which the abbey later fell into arrears.|$|E

In the series, some of his comments and actions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> dumbfound his co-workers and superiors. His relationship with his subordinates in the office is portrayed as being a father figure to the team, but very professional in his work.|$|E

5|$|In {{the south}} range, {{parts of the}} medieval {{buildings}} survive and are incorporated into staircase ten — the straight, steep flight of stairs and timber framed partitions date from a mid-15th century rebuilding of St Mary Hall. The former Chapel, Hall and Buttery of St Mary Hall, built in 1640, form part of the Junior Library and Junior Common Room. Viewed from the third quad, the Chapel, with its Gothic windows, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> have been built neatly {{on top of the}} Hall, a unique example in Oxford of such a plan.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Marathon was a {{watershed}} in the Greco-Persian wars, showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten; the eventual Greek triumph in these wars <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> begin at Marathon. The battle also showed the Greeks {{that they were}} able to win battles without the Spartans, as they had heavily relied on Sparta previously. This win was largely due to the Athenians, and Marathon raised Greek esteem of them. Since the following two hundred years saw the rise of the Classical Greek civilization, which has been enduringly influential in western society, the Battle of Marathon is often seen as a pivotal moment in Mediterranean and European history.|$|E
5|$|The {{cell nucleus}} {{contains}} {{the majority of}} the cell's genetic material in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. Each human cell contains roughly two meters of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> form the well-defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. A small fraction of the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria.|$|E
5|$|When {{observed}} {{under the}} electron microscope, the nucleolus <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> consist of three distinguishable regions: the innermost fibrillar centers (FCs), {{surrounded by the}} dense fibrillar component (DFC), {{which in turn is}} bordered by the granular component (GC). Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and, therefore, when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased, more FCs are detected. Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occur in the GC.|$|E

5|$|The Renaissance in Scotland was a cultural, {{intellectual}} and artistic movement in Scotland, {{from the late}} fifteenth century {{to the beginning of}} the seventeenth century. It is associated with the pan-European Renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in Italy in the late fourteenth century and reaching northern Europe as a Northern Renaissance in the fifteenth century. It involved an attempt to revive the principles of the classical era, including humanism, a spirit of scholarly enquiry, scepticism, and concepts of balance and proportion. Since the twentieth century the uniqueness and unity of the Renaissance has been challenged by historians, but significant changes in Scotland <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> have taken place in education, intellectual life, literature, art, architecture, music and politics.|$|E
5|$|The lack of old native {{names for}} {{it has been}} used to {{demonstrate}} its absence in Britain before introduction in around 1487, but this is challenged by the presence of an old Scottish Gaelic name for the tree, fior chrann which suggests a longer presence in Scotland at least {{as far back as the}} Gaelic settlement at Dál Riata in the late 6th and early 7th centuries. This would make it either an archaeophyte (a naturalised tree introduced by humans before 1500) or perhaps native if it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> have reached Scotland without human intervention. At the moment it is usually classified as a neophyte, a plant that is naturalised but arrived with humans on or after the year 1500. Today, the sycamore is present in 3,461 (89.7%) of hectads in Britain, more than any native tree species.|$|E
5|$|These revelations {{make the}} {{painting}} difficult to date. Velázquez's painting technique offers no assistance, although its {{strong emphasis on}} colour and tone suggest that the work dates from his mature period. The best estimates of its origin put its completion in the late 1640s or early 1650s, either in Spain or during Velázquez's last visit to Italy. If this is the case, then the breadth of handling and the dissolution of form <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> {{mark the beginning of}} the artist's final period. The conscientious modelling and strong tonal contrasts of his earlier work are here replaced by a restraint and subtlety which would culminate in his late masterpiece, Las Meninas.|$|E

5|$|While {{humans have}} the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an {{environment}} in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> be adapted specifically to these purposes. Due {{to the way in which}} language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.|$|E
5|$|Adding a {{multiple}} of any row to another row, or {{a multiple}} of any column to another column, {{does not change the}} determinant. Interchanging two rows or two columns affects the determinant by multiplying it by −1. Using these operations, any matrix can be transformed to a lower (or upper) triangular matrix, and for such matrices the determinant equals the product of the entries on the main diagonal; this provides a method to calculate the determinant of any matrix. Finally, the Laplace expansion expresses the determinant in terms of minors, that is, determinants of smaller matrices. This expansion can be used for a recursive definition of determinants (taking as starting case the determinant of a 1-by-1 matrix, which is its unique entry, or even the determinant of a 0-by-0 matrix, which is 1), that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>to</b> be equivalent to the Leibniz formula. Determinants can be used to solve linear systems using Cramer's rule, where the division of the determinants of two related square matrices equates to the value of each of the system's variables.|$|E
