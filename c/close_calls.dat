5|$|Following an {{encounter}} with the rich and detestable Parta, who intends to take her as his second wife, Rasminah goes to the nearby city of Batavia (now Jakarta) to find a job. Several days later, having found work, she returns to Puncak to pick up Hadidjah and take her to Batavia. However, Parta and his cohort Doel are waiting in ambush. When Rasminah's carriage is stuck in a rut, the two begin to chase after her. Rasminah runs into the woods and, after several <b>close</b> <b>calls,</b> finds shelter in a small house.

5|$|This left Australia {{to chase}} 404 runs for victory. At the time, {{this would have}} been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, {{predicting}} that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating spinners' wicket. Morris and Hassett started slowly, with only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch that offered spin and bounce. Only 44 runs came in the first hour, leaving 360 runs needed in 285 minutes. Both players survived <b>close</b> <b>calls</b> before Hassett fell at 1/57.|$|E
5|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of outdoor enthusiasts attempt to summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a piker {{if you think this}} is the summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of the north and west sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous {{for a variety of reasons}} and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had <b>close</b> <b>calls.</b>|$|E

The introduction of the <b>closing</b> <b>call</b> auction is associated with a reduction in trading volume at the close of continuous trading.

5|$|The Phillies {{opened the}} month of August with three {{straight}} losses, but the stopper's role again fell to the rookie Happ, who pitched his second shutout of the season—and the second of his career—against the Rockies on August 5. He earned the team's 60th win of the season while allowing four hits and striking out ten batters {{for the first time}} in his career. In accordance with his 8–2 record and strong performances, Amaro announced that Happ would remain in the Phillies' starting rotation despite the team's acquisitions of Lee and Pedro Martínez; rumors regarding Happ's status had been rampant since Martínez' signing and during the trade season when Happ was rumored to be the centerpiece of a potential trade for the Blue Jays' Roy Halladay. New pitcher Lee stifled the Rockies the following day to win the series for the Phillies with a second consecutive strong performance, allowing one run over seven innings and allowing only six hits. In the following series with Florida, however, the Phillies struggled. The Marlins swept all three games of the series, which included Victorino's first career ejection on several <b>close</b> <b>calls</b> by umpire Ed Rapuano, and a crucial error by Victorino's center field replacement, Werth, in the final game of the series. Moyer pitched against the Marlins in that game, a team against which he had prior success in his career (13–3, 2.87 ERA in 100 innings pitched), and allowed two earned runs on eleven singles through five innings; however, with a rotation-high 5.47 ERA, the Phillies demoted Moyer to the bullpen to allow Martínez to start. Francisco hit his second Phillies home run against the Cubs on August 11; it came in the 12th inning and scored the game-winning run for the Phillies. It became the first win of a three-game series sweep, which Lee closed out with a third straight dominant performance (eight innings pitched, one run allowed, eight strikeouts). The Phillies took two of three games from the Braves in their next series, and completed a three-game homestand against the Diamondbacks with a complete game from Lee, who carried a no-hitter into the sixth inning, and eight innings of three-run baseball from Blanton.|$|E

40|$|To reduce market {{volatility}} observed {{at the close}} of trading and to enhance the fairness of the closing price, the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE) changed the way it executed its closing transactions by instituting a five-minute <b>closing</b> <b>call</b> auction. This paper examines the effectiveness of this new mechanism for the TSE. The empirical results show that the <b>closing</b> <b>call</b> has effectively reduced {{market volatility}} at closing and enhanced market efficiency by reducing noise in stock closing prices. However, market liquidity has declined, primarily due to the actions of individual investors. Because the limit order book is fully opaque for the five-minute call period, investors may close their position earlier than the closing period to avoid additional risk. This implies that, to maximize the benefits of the <b>closing</b> <b>call,</b> the TSE should provide the transparency of the limit order book for the <b>closing</b> <b>call</b> period. call auction, market microstructure, market quality.,...|$|R

Rusk was most familiar with Mount Adams, climbing it many times and exploring the area around it extensively.|$|E
25|$|Butler {{had made}} it back to the National Championship {{for the second year in}} a row after losing their best player and {{eventual}} NBA star Gordon Hayward of the Utah Jazz.

The Butler basketball team was able to pull off upset after upset, game winning shot after game winning shot. Matt Howard made the game winning free throw against The University Pittsburgh after they were losing by one and Matt was fouled 86 feet away from the basket. That wouldn’t be the final of their <b>close</b> <b>calls</b> for this tournament, nor was it their first.

25|$|The PW-4 {{was built}} for U.S. Navy Specification No. 96, calling for a carrier-based light fighter. This {{specification}} was eventually revealed as a cover for the Navy's actual desire for an airship fighter, the Curtiss XF9C. The XFA was a single-bay biplane with an all-metal fuselage and metal laminate skin. The construction of its fuselage was innovative in that instead of using lap jointing, the edges of each panel were bent inwards, with the rivets fastening them on the inside, instead of being visible on the surface. It had a gull-type upper wing which was fabric covered. The prototype was ordered in 1930, but the company was engaged in another reorganization, which delayed its work. Delivered for evaluations in 1932, it showed poor flying characteristics, including longitudinal instability and over-sensitive controls. General Aircraft increased {{the area of the}} tail surfaces and made other changes, then returned the prototype for more testing; but now the stability problems were worse. The plane would nose up with more throttle, but then drop its nose when the throttle was reduced. After another round of modifications, and some <b>close</b> <b>calls,</b> the plane was finally classed as unsafe and testing was abandoned.|$|E
