50|$|Park et al. {{conceptualized}} carcinogenesis of {{hepatocellular carcinoma}} (HCC) as a multistep process involving parenchymal arterialization, sinusoidal capillarization, {{and development of}} unpaired arteries (a vital component of tumor angiogenesis). All these events lead to a gradual shift in tumor blood supply from portal to arterial circulation. This concept has been validated using dynamic imaging modalities by various investigators. Sigurdson et al. demonstrated that when an agent was infused via the hepatic artery, intratumoral concentrations were ten times greater compared to when agents were administered through the portal vein. Hence, arterial treatment targets the tumor while normal liver is relatively spared. Embolization induces ischemic necrosis of tumor causing {{a failure of the}} transmembrane pump, resulting in a greater absorption of agents by the tumor cells.

40|$|ACE-related contribution) This paper {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} unplanned coordination among independent agents in a market selection game, which is a non-cooperative repeated game with many agents (e. g., 100 agents) and several markets (e. g., five markets). Every agent is supposed to simultaneously choose a single market for maximizing its own payoff obtained by selling its product at the selected market. It is assumed that the market price is determined by a linear decreasing function of the total supply at each market. For example, if many agents choose a particular market, the market price at that market is low. On the contrary, the market price is high if {{only a small number}} of agents choose that market. In this manner, the market prices are determined by the actions of all agents. The point of our market selection game is to choose a market with a high market price, i. e., a market that is not chosen by many other agents. In this paper, the evolution of game strategies is performed by localized selection and mutation. A new strategy of an agent is probabilistically selected from its neighbors' strategies by the selection operation or randomly updated by the mutation operation. It is shown that the maximization of each agent's payoff through the genetic operations leads to the unplanned coordination of the market selection where the undesired <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>agents</b> is avoided. Through computer simulations, the unplanned coordination is compared with the planned global coordination realized by the maximization of the total payoff over all agents. Simulation results show that almost the same average payoff is obtained by these two schemes. That is, the selfish maximization of each agent's payoff through the genetic operations leads to a near-optimal result with resp [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Many {{studies have}} shown that {{microorganisms}} are the main cause of pulpal diseases and the main purpose of root canal therapy is their elimination from the root canal system. Antiseptic agents are used to reduce bacteria but their antibacterial activities differ from in vivo to in vitro studies and might be inactivated by dentin and its components in root canal space. This study was designed to investigate the effect of dentin on antibacterial activity of different antimicrobial agents. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, two antibacterial agents (sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine) with different concentrations were used in four experimental groups: Group 1 : dentin, Group 2 : demineralized dentin with EDTA, Group 3 : dentin matrix and Group 4 : dentin mineral component. The species used in this study was Entrococcus faecalis. Different <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>agents</b> were added to mixture of each experimental group and bacteria. At the baseline and after one and 24 hours, samples were collected and cultured. After incubation period, colonies were counted. Data were analyzed by Tukey test with p< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: 2 % and 0. 2 % chlorhexidine, and 5 % sodium hypochlorite solutions at the three studied times eliminated Entrococcus faecalis completely. 1 % sodium hypochlorite eliminated all bacteria in 1 h and 24 hs. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between experimental and control groups (P< 0. 05). Sodium 1 % hypochlorite at time 0, could reduce bacteria significantly (P< 0. 05) but didn’t eliminate them completely. Conclusion: Inactivation of intracanal antiseptics was not observed in this study. As elimination of bacteria occurred, application of these antibacterial agents are recommended in endodontic treatment. Further investigations on other antibacterial agents, other concentrations and shorter time intervals are recommended...|$|E
40|$|Vascularized tumor {{growth is}} {{characterized}} by both abnormal interstitial fluid flow and the associated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP). Here, we study the effect that these conditions have on the transport of therapeutic agents during chemotherapy. We apply our recently developed vascular tumor growth model which couples a continuous growth component with a discrete angiogenesis model to show that hypertensive IFP is a physical barrier that may hinder vascular extravasation of agents through transvascular fluid flux convection, which drives the agents away from the tumor. This result {{is consistent with previous}} work using simpler models without blood flow or lymphatic drainage. We consider the vascular/interstitial/lymphatic fluid dynamics to show that tumors with larger lymphatic resistance increase the agent concentration more rapidly while also experiencing faster washout. In contrast, tumors with smaller lymphatic resistance accumulate less agents but are able to retain them for a longer time. The agent availability (area-under-the curve, or AUC) increases for less permeable agents as lymphatic resistance increases, and correspondingly decreases for more permeable agents. We also investigate the effect of vascular pathologies on agent transport. We show that elevated vascular hydraulic conductivity contributes to the highest AUC when the agent is less permeable, but to lower AUC when the agent is more permeable. We find that elevated interstitial hydraulic conductivity contributes to low AUC in general regardless of the transvascular agent transport capability. We also couple the agent transport with the tumor dynamics to simulate chemotherapy with the same vascularized tumor under different vascular pathologies. We show that tumors with an elevated interstitial hydraulic conductivity alone require the strongest dosage to shrink. We further show that tumors with elevated vascular hydraulic conductivity are more hypoxic during therapy and that the response slows down as the tumor shrinks due to the heterogeneity and low <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>agents</b> in the tumor interior compared with the cases where other pathological effects may combine to flatten the IFP and thus reduce the heterogeneity. We conclude that dual normalizations of the micronevironment ? both the vasculature and the interstitium ? are needed to maximize the effects of chemotherapy, while normalization of only one of these may be insufficient to overcome the physical resistance and may thus lead to sub-optimal outcomes.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of research on the influence of the developed complex preparation Metisevit on the dynamics of morphological and biochemical blood indicators of piglets under nitrate loading. The research established that sodium nitrate intoxication causes disbalance of the physiological level of hematological indicators of the tested animals’ organisms. This was indicated by the manifestations of subclinical chronic nitrate-nitrite toxicosis: the increase in the level of nitrates, nitrites and methemoglobin in the blood. After prolonged feeding of the piglets with sodium nitrate at a dose of 0. 3 g nitrate ion/kg, the concentration of nitrates and nitrites in the blood serum reached its maximum on the 60 th day of the experiment. Also, the number of leukocytes and erythrocytes in the blood increased, and the activity of aspartate- and alanineaminotransferase in the blood serum increased. We rank the extent of liver intoxication with nitrates according to intensity of aminotransferase in the blood serum of the tested piglets. The normalization of morphological and biochemical blood indicators of piglets under nitrate-nitrite intoxication requires usage of a preparation which contains vitamins, zeolites and antioxidants. If the fodder contains high doses of nitrates, 1. 0 mg/kg dose of Metisevit is added to the fodder for preventing subclinical nitrate-nitrite toxicosis. Metisevit contains the following agents: phenozan acid, methionine, zeolite, selenium, vitamins E and C. The research conducted proved the feasibility of using Metisevit for preventing chronic nitrate-nitrite toxicosis in piglets. This preparation caused a decrease in the concentration of nitrates, nitrites and in the level of methemoglobin in the blood of piglets. Usage of Metisevit on piglets showed normalization of the number of erythrocytes and hemoglobin in the blood on the 10 th day, and normalization of ASAT and ALAT on 30 th and 90 th days. The mechanism of Metisevit activity is connected with the direct contribution of its elements to the inhibition of the processes of absorbing metabolites which cause a toxic effect on the cell membranes of an animal’s organism. The absorbing activity of zeolite leads to decrease in <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>agents</b> which can be substrates for processes of peroxidation of lipids in the alimentary canal, and also to elimination of toxic pro-oxidant metabolites from the blood. This process occurs through osmosis and diffusion of these elements in the capillaries of microvilli of the small intestine and through their further fixation on sorbent granules...|$|E

When the phenol formation is high, reductive reverse reaction utilizing conduction band electron leading to forniation of benzene becomes more prominent, thereby decreasing the photocatalytic degradation rate.
