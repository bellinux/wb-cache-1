One of the few additions to the book was Mrs. Voorhees begging the Christy family to take her back after the loss of her son; they agreed. Another addition in the novel is more understanding in Mrs. Voorhees' actions. Hawke felt the character had attempted to move on when Jason died, but her psychosis got the best of her. When Steve Christy reopened the camp, Mrs. Voorhees saw it as a chance that what happened to her son <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again.</b> Her murders were against the counselors, because she saw them all as responsible for Jason's death.|$|E
25|$|Using {{vector control}} and strict {{vaccination}} programs, the urban cycle of yellow fever was nearly eradicated from South America. Since 1943, {{only a single}} urban outbreak in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, has occurred. Since the 1980s, though, the number of yellow fever cases has been increasing again, and A. aegypti {{has returned to the}} urban centers of South America. This is partly due to limitations on available insecticides, as well as habitat dislocations caused by climate change. It is also because the vector control program was abandoned. Although no new urban cycle has yet been established, scientists believe this <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again</b> at any point. An outbreak in Paraguay in 2008 was thought to be urban in nature, but this ultimately proved not to be the case.|$|E

500|$|In 1766 {{supercargo}} Johann Krause {{was probably}} the most experienced merchant trading in Madagascar, although he had been [...] "guilty of an earlier indiscretion in 1760", on the VOC ship Neptunus. To avoid the loss of profit caused by captive Malagasy dying while at sea, Krause convinced Captain Muller, who was in his first command and was unwell at the time, to unshackle some of them and let them work on deck. Disease was spreading among the Malagasy in the unsanitary conditions below deck, and the ship's surgeon had reported that, while there were no suitable medicines on board, disease was spreading to the crew. Consequently, two days after the ship had left Madagascar, the crew released a [...] "large party of [...] " [...] from confinement, the men assisting the crew and the women providing entertainment by dancing and singing. The Malagasy Massavana and some others were set to controlling and taking care of the sails, which has been described as [...] "unheard of, and certainly against all [...] regulations". Allowing slaves into secure areas on deck was common practice on most European vessels, and VOC regulations did permit slaves to be released onto the deck from time to time, under careful supervision. But the chief concern was that slaves might jump overboard to escape, rather than that they might mutiny, despite a slave mutiny on the VOC ship Drie Heuvelen in 1753. That mutiny was quickly suppressed, but clearly it <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> <b>again,</b> making Captain Muller's agreement to the kind of release that occurred on Meermin [...] "appear all the more foolish." ...|$|E
