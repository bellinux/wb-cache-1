In this quarter runs for methane regeneration were completed. The data obtained were evaluated and interpreted. When the sulfated sorbent was regenerated with methane coke formation on the sorbent was observed. Treatment of fresh sorbent with methane also resulted in <b>coking.</b> <b>Coke</b> formed on the sorbent disappeared very rapidly after the methane flow was replaced with nitrogen. The order of the regeneration reaction with respect to methane was estimated as 0 : 76 and the activation energy of the reaction was estimated as 130 kJ/mol. During repeated sulfation-regeneration cycles the decrease in the sulfur capacity after the first cycle was slightly more when regeneration was done with methane compared to that observed with hydrogen regeneration. In the subsequent 4 cycles, the ceria sorbent preserved its sulfur capacity. The regenerated sorbent was able to capture 1. 5 sulfur atoms per cerium atom in less than an hour of sulfation, compared to S/Ce of 2. 5 for fresh sorbents and 2 for sorbents regenerated with hydrogen...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- During {{the past}} century, many {{efforts were made}} to develop {{processes}} for producing iron for steel making without the use of coke. This becomes vital where country like India has limited reserve of <b>coking</b> coal. <b>Coke</b> making is extremely problematic from environmental point of view. The reduction of iron ore with non coking coal or gas below the melting point of the iron produced is classified as Direct Reduction process and product referred to as Direct Reduced Iron (DRI). The iron making reactions in iron oxide plus carbon involve the disappearance of two solid phases (iron oxide and carbon) and formation of two phases (metallic iron and gases). The location of the regions where the production of DRI is concentrated is determined by two factors: the availability of cheap natural gas or non coking coal plus the availability of high quality iron bearing raw material (65 % Fe content or more). In the present investigation an attempt has been made to study the direct reduction behaviour of iron ore fines with non-coking coal fines. For this purpose the effect of reduction time,temperature and Fe 2 O 3 : C ratio on degree of reduction has been studied. It is observed that degree of reduction increases with increase in Fe 2 O 3 : C ratio, temperature and time. The value of activation energy in the temperature range 1173 - 1323 K is 203. 2 KJ/mole.

40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The carbonization of some low volatile matter coals {{for the production of}} metallurgical coke in slot type ovens is accompanied by the exertion of pressures on the walls which can be dangerous and destroy the walls. It is generally accepted that coking pressure originates from the volatile matter released from the coal being retained as pressurized vapours trapped within the plastic layer of the carbonizing coal charge. Pressure during carbonization also influences the nature of the carbon texture and the porous structure of coke is strongly dependent on volatile matter release during the plastic stage of the carbonization process. There is therefore a possible association of <b>coking</b> pressure, <b>coke</b> porous structure and coke carbon texture. Seven coals giving a variety of wall pressures, as measured in a movable-wall oven,ranging from safe to dangerously coking, were carbonized in a small laboratory oven. The textural compositions of the resultant cokes were assessed by polarized light microscopy while pore structural parameters were measured by computerized image analysis. The textural compositions varied with volatile matter content of the coals while the porosities varied linearly with the internal gas pressures measured in a single plastic layer. In an attempt to investigate possible relations between the pore structure development and internal gas pressures generated in a single plastic layer, polished surfaces showing the coal-to-coke transformation were prepared after quenching carbonized single-wall oven charges. These surfaces were studied by image analysis techniques to obtain measurements of the pore sizes as carbonization proceeded. Pore sizes generally rose to a maximum within the plastic temperature range before falling to the almost constant value seen in the semicoke. No systematic variation between the pore structure development and the internal gas pressures could be established...|$|R
50|$|As the {{machines}} became bigger and moved from water power to steam power, locally mined coal and charcoal became expensive {{and there was}} not enough of it. The Bergische industry ordered more and more coal from the new coal mining area along the Ruhr river. Impressive and expensive railways were constructed through the hilly Wupper region, to bring coal, and later steel, in from the Ruhr, and for outward transport of finished products.By 1850, there were almost 300 coal mines in operation in the Ruhr area, in and around the central cities of Duisburg, Essen, Bochum and Dortmund. The coal was exported or processed in <b>coking</b> ovens into <b>coke,</b> used in blast furnaces, producing iron and steel. In this period the name Ruhrgebiet became common. Before the coal deposits along the Ruhr were exhausted, the mining industry moved northward to the Emscher and finally to the Lippe, drilling ever deeper mines as it went. Locks built at Mülheim on the Ruhr led to the expansion of Mülheim as a port. With the construction of the Cologne-Minden railway in the late 19th century, several iron works were built within the borders of the present-day city of Oberhausen.|$|R
40|$|The Reflux Classifier (RC) is a {{separation}} technique {{which has been}} used in the coal and mineral processing industries. It uses water as a medium, and is therefore a suitable preparation device for studies on coking coal as other separation techniques may change coking properties. The separation process was conducted by using a channel spacing of 3 mm between two adjacent plates (a deviation from the previous 1. 77 -mm spacing which promoted laminar flow). The 3 -mm channel gap which equated to nominal particle size of <b>coking</b> coal in <b>coke</b> oven charge could lead to a transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the separation process. By changing water flow rate in the separation system, two coals, one coking coal and one thermal coal with particle size of − 210 + 100 μm, were separated into different fractions. The fractions contained vitrinite-rich and inetinite-rich concentrates with vitrinite concentration between 28 – 84 % for the coking coal and 20 – 75 % for the thermal coal.

40|$|Direct-reduced iron (DRI), {{also called}} sponge iron, is {{produced}} from direct reduction of iron ore (in {{the form of}} lumps, pellets or fines) by a reducing gas produced from natural gas or coal. Unlike the conventional process, the process does not require <b>coking</b> coal; the <b>coke</b> ovens in a steel plant are expensive and polluting units. Direct reduction, has been developed to overcome these difficulties of conventional blast furnaces.

40|$|Thesis (MTech(Environmental Health) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011 Coke ovens {{may occur}} in the aluminium, steel, graphite, electrical, and {{construction}} industries. In the work area coke-oven workers may be exposed to various chemical compounds. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as human carcinogen, are primary compounds in coke oven emissions (COEs) generated in the <b>coking</b> process. <b>Coke</b> oven workers are often exposed to PAHs {{and can lead to}} a variety of human diseases. The primary routes of potential human exposure to coke oven emissions are inhalation and dermal contact. Occupational exposure may occur during the production of coke from coal, or while using coke to extract metals from their ores to synthesize calcium carbide, or to manufacture graphite and electrodes. Workers at coking plants and coal tar production plants, as well as the residents surrounding these plants, have a high risk of possible exposure to coke oven emissions. It is known that coke production could be carcinogenic to humans (Group- 1) by IARC. There has been sufficient epidemiological evidence suggesting an etiological link between carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) exposure and lung cancer risk among coke-oven workers. Lung cancer among coke-oven workers has been classified as one of the eight prescribed occupational cancers in China, and its incidence rate was about 10 times that of the general population. Therefore, lung cancer of coke-oven workers is still a critical issue in the field of prevention and control of occupational cancers in China. This thesis explores the various exposure levels of workers to PAHs at a steel plant in China. The measurement will focus on the exposure difference of personal sampling among workers in selected job classifications given the job descriptions and the coking process. The Benxi Steel Industry in Liaoning province of China (BXSI) was selected as the research location. Liaoning province is in the North of China and the location of various heavy industries in China. The measurements will be done two separate coke ovens in Benxi Steel Industry.

40|$|A {{two-stage}} {{study was}} undertaken to establish what effect, if any, perchloroethylene has on coal coking properties. Stage 1 was a kinetic {{study in which}} the Gieseler fluidity of samples of a high fluidity coal was measured over a 64 -week period. Two of the samples were left untreated, with one stored in air and one immersed in water. The third sample was also stored in air, but was soaked in perchloroethylene for 2 h and then air dried immediately prior to fluidity testing. In Stage 2, seven different coking coals were studied, covering three different Australian coal measures and {{a wide range of}} coking rank. For each coal, a 40 kg clean coal composite was formed using laboratory water-based methods, a Reflux Classier for the 0. 038 – 0. 25 mm and 0. 25 – 2. 0 mm size fractions and a Mintek jig for the 2. 0 – 16 and 16 – 50 mm size fractions. This 40 kg composite was then subdivided into four sub-samples. Samples A and B were coked immediately, whereas Samples C and D were stored in open trays at ambient conditions for a month before coking. Samples B and D were soaked in perchloroethylene for 2 h and then air dried prior to coke testing, whereas Samples A and C were left untreated. Coal properties were measured prior to coking, and after <b>coking</b> the NSC <b>Coke</b> Reactivity Index (CRI) and Coke Strength after Reaction (CSR) were measured. In Stage 1 it was found that storage under water was able to maintain the sample fluidity better than refrigerated storage. The combined Stage 1 and 2 results showed that perchloroethylene had a detrimental effect on the coking properties of many coals. Hence coking tests on clean coal composites formed using heavy organic liquids may often under predict a coal’s true coking properties. This could lead to many coal deposits being undervalued. Perchloroethylene had the largest detrimental effect on the fluidity, CRI and CSR of coals that started with relatively poor properties. Perchloroethylene had a negligible effect on coals with relatively good initial coking properties. There was no clear correlation with vitrinite reflectance. The three most seriously affected coals all had relatively high inertinite content. It is speculated that the higher porosity of inertinite might allow greater access and retention of perchloroethylene in the coal particles. The laboratory water-based methods were able to produce clean coal composites that matched the proximate, petrographic and coal swelling number properties of the coal preparation plant product. The dilatometer and fluidity results were lower than those of the coal preparation plant, but this {{can be explained by the}} up to three month delay between mining of the original sample and the coking of the composite. These delays were an unavoidable part of the research nature of this project and had nothing to do with the water based methods deployed. If these water-based methods of preparing clean-coal composites were to become standardized, then there is no reason why a well equipped coal testing facility could not receive a refrigerated bore core and produce a clean coal composite within the period of a week...|$|R
