5000|$|The design {{specifications}} {{for the six}} ships were for length overall of 459 ft, length between perpendiculars 435 ft, molded beam of 63 ft, depth to shelter deck of 40 ft and loaded draft of 25 ft. Cargo capacity was for [...] with loaded displacement of 13900 LT and <b>cargo</b> <b>deadweight</b> of 7613 LT. With fuel capacity of 1500 LT cruising range was approximately 20000 mi at a normal speed of 15.5 kn. The hull was a full shelter deck type with seven transverse water tight bulkheads, five holds, three forward and two aft of the engine spaces with 20 ft by 30 ft hatches except for #1 at 29 ft in length and #3 which was 50 ft in length. Holds were served by booms and 50 horsepower electric winches on six king posts. The four story deck house had quarters for officers and six staterooms with private baths on the bridge deck for twelve passengers. Crew spaces were on the shelter deck level of the deck house.|$|E
2500|$|Initially {{constructed}} as two-decks three-masted full-rigged ship, in 1898 the Star of Bengal was re-rigged as a barque. Her gross tonnage was 1877, net tonnage 1694, tonnage under deck 1684. She was [...] long, [...] wide and [...] deep, {{and designed to}} be operated by a crew of seventeen.

5000|$|The Berge Fjord {{was built}} in 1986 by {{shipbuilder}} Industrias Verolme Ishibras in the yard of Brazil Estaleiros S.A. The ship has an overall length of 331.50 m, while the length between perpendiculars is 316.00 m. Berge Fjord has moulded breadth 57.20 m and extreme breadth of 57.26 m. The depth of the ship is 30.90 m, while the draft, when fully loaded, is 23.19 m. The ship is built according to double hull technology.Builders utilized the space between double hulls for ballast tanks, which are easier for usage and maintenance, without interfering with the <b>cargo</b> spaces.The <b>deadweight</b> of Berge Fjord is 310,698 metric tons, the gross tonnage is 159,534 and the net tonnage is 63,935.|$|R
5000|$|The vessel {{is among}} the largest {{container}} ships {{in the world and}} has overall length of 398 m, moulded beam of 54 m and maximum draft of 16.0 m. The <b>cargo</b> ship has <b>deadweight</b> of 185,000 DWT and gross tonnage of 175,000 GRT with capacity for 17,722 TEU. The cargo ship has 1,254 reefer points for transportation of temperature controlled containers. With a breadth of 54 metres, it can carry 21 containers across, athwartships.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} choosing the optimal value of the <b>cargo</b> ships <b>deadweight.</b> The method may be useful at the stage of establishing the main owners requirements concerning the ship design parameters {{as well as for}} choosing a proper ship for a given transportation task. The deadweight is determined {{on the basis of a}} selected economic measure of the transport effectiveness of ship - the Required Freight Rate (RFR). The mathematical model of the problem is of a deterministic character and the simplifying assumptions are justified for ships operating in the liner trade. The assumptions are so selected that solution of the problem is obtained in analytical closed form. The presented method can be useful for application in the pre-investment ships designing parameters simulation or transportation task studies...|$|R
5000|$|Hyundai Pride {{was ordered}} by Hyundai Merchant Marine in August 2011 at the {{shipyard}} of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering in Geoje, South Korea. The vessel was planned to start serving the G6 Asia-Europe Loop 6 sea {{line of the}} company. The container ship has length of 366.5 m, beam of 48 m, depth of 30 m and maximum summer draft of 14.5 m. The <b>cargo</b> ship has <b>deadweight</b> [...] and gross tonnage [...] With such dimensions the vessel can carry 13,154 TEU and has 900 reefer points for transportation of temperature controlled containers.|$|R
50|$|The canal runs {{partially}} along several canalized {{rivers and}} Lake Vygozero. The total {{length of the}} route is 227 km. As of 2008, the canal sees only light traffic, carrying between ten and forty boats per day. Its economic advantages are limited by its minimal depth of 3.5 m, inadequate for most sea-going vessels. The canal was originally proposed to be 5.4 m deep; however, various cost issues forced completion to a much lesser depth. This depth typically corresponds to river craft with <b>deadweight</b> <b>cargo</b> up to 600 t, whilst useful sea going vessels of 2,000-3,000 dwt typically have drafts of 4.5 - 6 m.|$|R
5000|$|During 1957 {{the main}} {{efforts of the}} entire staff of the {{shipyard}} was directed {{to the construction of}} the first in this class <b>cargo</b> ship with <b>deadweight</b> 16 000 mt? the bigger merchant ship in USSR. From the beginning the pre-production was delayed due to the backlog of the design work in the Nicholayev Central Design Buro [...] "Chernomorsudoproekt", as well as extremely unsatisfactory receipt of rolled metal products. These circumstances made a very difficult situation for shipbuilders. A particularly large amount of work was to perform The chief technologist's department and technicians workshops had too much works: to develop a fundamentally new technology of ship's construction, create standard technological processes and schedules for preparation of production in a short time.|$|R
