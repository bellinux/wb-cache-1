Almost all of these microactuators {{are based on the}} electromagnetic effect and the force is generated by the electromagnetic coil, between the soft magnetic <b>core</b> <b>and</b> the (magnetic) cantilever. To integrate all of these magnetic components on the same chip, microstructures with different aspect ratios were fabricated in a single layer by using a photolithography process using the negative photoresist SU- 8 2000. A copper microcoil, a permalloy <b>core</b> <b>and</b> a <b>nickel</b> <b>metal</b> post for suspending a cantilever beam were electroplated on the same seed layer with aspect ratios varying from 1 : 1, 5 : 1 to 10 : 1, and the dimensions of the features ranging from 25 µm to 500 µm. The three different features were fabricated separately in three layers. Different viscosity of SU- 8 2000 was used in three layers. 50 µm, 80 µm and 200 µm thick SU- 8 are used to pattern the molds for electroplating three different features. 25 µm thick copper microcoils with an aspect ratio 1 : 1 was first electroplated on the Ti/Cu/Ti seed layer. This is followed by electroplating of 50 µm thick permalloy layer with an aspect ratio 10 : 1 on the same seed layer. A 100 µm thick copper post with an aspect ratio 5 : 1 was electroplated on to the same seed layer in the next step. SU- 8 resist molds were removed between each of these layers. Finally, the residual SU- 8 was cleaned by CF 4 plasma etching. The coils have 19 turns with a footprint area of 10 mm 2. The microcoils were tested to ascertain their maximum current densities before burnout. Similarly, the magnetic properties of the Permalloy core were also tested. The profiles of different layers and the coil <b>and</b> permalloy <b>core</b> test results were discussed in detail in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Proceedings of the 32 nd Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference, Honolulu, HI, July 27 - August 1, 1997 A {{spreadsheet}} {{model for}} the analysis of batteries of various types has been developed that permits the calculation of the size and performance characteristics of the battery based on its internal geometry and electrode/electrolyte material properties. The method accounts for most of the electrochemical mechanisms in both the anode and cathode without solving the governing partial differential equations. The spreadsheet calculations for a particular battery design are performed much like a battery test in that the C/ 3 capacity of the battery to a specified cut-off voltage is determined and then the pulse power capability at a given state-of-charge is determined by finding the maximum current density (A/cm 2) for which the cell voltage equals a specified minimum value. For a multi-cell module, the module characteristics are calculated using the cell results and packaging input information. The spreadsheet model has been validated for existing lead-acid (Sonnenschein), <b>nickel</b> cadmium (Saft), <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> <b>metal</b> hydride (Ovonic) batteries for which test data and internal geometry information are available.
