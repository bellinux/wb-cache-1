5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1961, Butlin began work on his camp in Minehead. The site {{opened to the public}} on 26 May 1962 having cost £2 million to construct. Over the next decade several attractions were added to the site; a {{miniature}} railway was added in 1964, <b>chairlifts</b> in 1965, and a monorail in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Modern winter service {{vehicles}} will usually {{also have a}} satellite navigation system connected to a weather forecast feed, allowing the driver to choose the best areas to treat and to avoid areas in which rain is likely, which can wash away the grit used—the most advanced can even adapt to changing conditions, ensuring optimal gritter and plow settings. Most run on wheels, often with snow chains or studded tires, but some are mounted on caterpillar tracks, with the tracks themselves adapted to throw the snow towards {{the side of the}} road. Off-road winter {{service vehicles}} mounted on caterpillar tracks are known as snowcats. Snowcats are commonly fitted with snowplows or snow groomers, and are used by ski resorts to smooth and maintain pistes and snowmobile runs, although they can also be used as a replacement for <b>chairlifts.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Gillett {{acquired}} Vail Associates' Vail and Beaver Creek ski resorts. George {{would often}} ride <b>chairlifts</b> and greet guests, {{and launched a}} massive installation of high-speed detachable <b>chairlifts.</b> Gillett also supported major alpine ski events {{at a time when}} most ski areas in America declined to host international races, starting with the 1989 World Alpine Ski Championships, and through his support hosted the 1999 World Alpine Ski Championships.|$|E

25|$|Transport rides {{are used}} to take large numbers of guests from one area to another, as an {{alternative}} to walking, especially for parks that are large or separated into distant areas. Transport rides include <b>chairlifts,</b> monorails, aerial trams, and escalators.|$|E
25|$|Snow play is {{available}} at Corin Forest, near Canberra, at an elevation of 1200m. A development plan was drafted following the 2003 Canberra bushfires which would see three 600m <b>chairlifts</b> installed together with snowmaking facilities and accommodation at this site.|$|E
50|$|A <b>chairlift</b> is {{the longest}} {{single-span}} <b>chairlift</b> in the world, with the longest span being 308 m. The <b>chairlift,</b> built in 1972, has a total span of 457 m.|$|R
50|$|The Magic Mile <b>chairlift</b> was {{the longest}} <b>chairlift</b> in the world, and the second <b>chairlift,</b> of those built to be a <b>chairlift</b> {{when it opened in}} 1939. Financial {{troubles}} operating the Lodge and World War II closed it for several years during the 1940s and 1950s. The ski area has successfully operated since 1956.|$|R
50|$|A skiing area of {{the same}} name also belongs to Pustevny. There are 11 lifts and one <b>chairlift.</b> The saddle is {{accessible}} by a <b>chairlift</b> from Ráztoka. This lift was the first <b>chairlift</b> built in Europeneeded.|$|R
25|$|Action Park's alpine slide {{descended the}} {{mountain}} roughly below {{one of the}} ski area's <b>chairlifts,</b> resulting in much verbal harassment and sometimes spitting from passengers going up for their turn, who would often be entertained by the accidents they witnessed {{while at the same}} time hoping to avoid similar fates.|$|E
25|$|Both ski {{fields are}} {{accessible}} by car and <b>chairlifts,</b> with beginners' to advanced skiing slopes. Whakapapa has five chair lifts with limited accommodation and refreshments available at Top o' the Bruce (the car {{park at the}} top of Bruce Road) and at the entry to Whakapapa, and elsewhere on the mountain. Alpine huts are provided for trampers and climbers. These are mainly owned by private clubs.|$|E
25|$|Sunshine Village ski {{runs and}} lifts are {{accessed}} via an eight-person high-speed gondola.

Leaving <b>Chairlift</b> meant leaving a major record label deal.|$|R
50|$|The Normal Route is the easiest, safest and fastest {{on account}} of the cable car and <b>chairlift</b> system which {{operates}} from about 9am till 3pm. Starting for the summit at about 2am from the Diesel Hut should allow just enough time to get back down to the <b>chairlift</b> if movement is efficient. In bad weather the <b>chairlift</b> section may be closed, also note the <b>chairlift</b> ride is 15 minutes long and can be very cold.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chairlift</b> was an American synthpop band. Caroline Polachek and Aaron Pfenning formed <b>Chairlift</b> in 2005 {{while living}} in Boulder, Colorado, and Patrick Wimberly joined them when they moved to Brooklyn in 2007. In 2008, <b>Chairlift</b> {{released}} their debut album Does You Inspire You.

50|$|Riblet <b>chairlifts</b> can {{be found}} in many places still in service, though the {{majority}} have been removed. This table contains those documented by SkiLifts.org as of December 28, 2007. More Riblet <b>chairlifts</b> may be in existence, though some listed below may have already been removed. There is a total of 160 existing Riblet <b>chairlifts</b> and 103 no longer installed.|$|E
50|$|The {{resort is}} {{accessible}} by road {{and by the}} Skitube, Australia's only underground rack railway. The main skiing period is in July and August, with the official season running from the second weekend in June to the first weekend of October. Perisher consists of 47 lifts: The Village Eight Express, an eight-seater chairlift (built in 2003), two high-speed quad detachable <b>chairlifts,</b> five fixed-grip quad <b>chairlifts,</b> four double <b>chairlifts,</b> two triple <b>chairlifts,</b> 21 T-Bars, three J-bars, seven ski carpets, and 2 rope tows. The run difficulties are graded 22% beginner, 60% intermediate and 18% advanced.|$|E
50|$|Restraining bars (almost {{always with}} foot rests) on <b>chairlifts</b> {{are more common}} in Europe and also {{naturally}} used by passengers of all ages. Some <b>chairlifts</b> have restraining bars that open and close automatically.|$|E
40|$|Sit-snowboards allow {{a person}} with the {{inability}} to actively use his/her legs to snowboard while sitting. However, existing prototypes do not allow using a <b>chairlift.</b> The goal {{of this study was}} to modify a prototype sit-snowboard, MINI, to add <b>chairlift</b> accessibility. MINI has a seat construction and two handlebars which allow the user to steer the snowboard. After thorough assessment of all constructed design parameters the most important design parameters for this research were determined; 1) the sit-snowboard seat needs to turn 90 degrees with respect to the snowboard, 2) the tubes of the sitting construction have to be constructed differently to allow the <b>chairlift</b> seat to get under the sit-snowboard seat, and 3) the rear handlebar needs to make way to allow space for the <b>chairlift.</b> A redesign of MINI was made with a bearing and locking mechanism for the sit-snowboard seat and detachable handlebars with a locking mechanism. Subsequently the prototype, SnowGo, was built and tested on snowboard-functionality and <b>chairlift</b> accessibility. The test results show that with SnowGo, it is possible to use the <b>chairlift</b> and maintain the ability to sit-snowboard. Using the <b>chairlift</b> without tumbling over during loading and unloading requires practice, but the sit-snowboarder showed that he did not need a lot of practice with SnowGo since he was able to use the <b>chairlift</b> without falling in four out of five trials. Two advantages were that the safety-bar of the <b>chairlift</b> can be closed during the <b>chairlift</b> ride and that the <b>chairlift</b> can be used by the sit-snowboarder completely independent of any help from a second person.
