5|$|The global {{financial}} {{system is the}} worldwide framework of legal agreements, institutions, and both formal and informal economic actors that together facilitate international flows of financial capital for purposes of investment and trade financing. Since emerging in the late 19th century during the first modern wave of economic globalization, its evolution is marked by the establishment of central banks, multilateral treaties, and intergovernmental organizations aimed at improving the transparency, regulation, and effectiveness of international markets. In the late 1800s, world migration and <b>communication</b> <b>technology</b> facilitated unprecedented growth in international trade and investment. At the onset of World War I, trade contracted as foreign exchange markets became paralyzed by money market illiquidity. Countries sought to defend against external shocks with protectionist policies and trade virtually halted by 1933, worsening {{the effects of the}} global Great Depression until a series of reciprocal trade agreements slowly reduced tariffs worldwide. Efforts to revamp the international monetary system after World War II improved exchange rate stability, fostering record growth in global finance.|$|E

This paper discusses these challenges and their potential impact. It first looks at what defines the two technologies then explores the laws and methods used for their investigation.

The Federal State Educational Standards for elementary education calls for developing pupils’ motivation sphere at every lesson and in each school subject. There is a system of means of developing pupils’ learning motivation which were elaborated in pedagogy and psychology but modern education places special emphasis on information and <b>communication</b> <b>technologies.</b> The purpose of the research is to define pedagogical and psychological conditions of using information and <b>communication</b> <b>technologies</b> {{as a means of}} develop a pupil's learning motivation in elementary school.

We made our research with the primary goal to examine conditions during complex experimental work in elementary school. According to the results, we made a system of lessons using information and <b>communication</b> <b>technologies</b> at different stages of lessons and teach pupils how to use these technologies on their own.
