40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a type system for support of subtypes, parameterized types with sharing and <b>categories</b> in <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> algebra environment. By modeling representation of instances {{in terms of}} existential types, we obtain a simplified model, and build a basis for defining subtyping among algebraic domains. The inheritance at category level has been formalized; this allows the automatic inference of type classes. By means of type classes and existential types we construct subtype relations without involving coercions. A type sharing mechanism works in parallel and allows the consistent extension and combination of domains. The expressiveness {{of the system is}} further increased by viewing domain types as special case of package types, forming weak and strong sums respectively. The introduced system, although awkward at first sight, is simpler than other proposed systems for computer algebra without including some of their problems. The system can be further extended in order to support more constructs and increase its flexibility...|$|R

40|$|Topological quantum {{computation}} (TQC) {{is a new}} fault-tolerant approach to quantum information, where computations are carried out by braiding particles called anyons. Anyons are quasiparticles that exist in 2 + 1 dimensions and are neither bosons or fermions. Modular tensor categories capture the structure of anyon systems and thus serve as models for topological {{quantum computation}}. However, program of using category theory to find higher-level structures and protocols {{has yet to be}} applied to TQC due to the difficulty of working with modular tensor categories. This difficulty could be greatly mitigated by the development of <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> algebra system to represent such <b>categories.</b> Thus, <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> algebra system for representing modular tensor categories within the symmetric monoidal 2 -category 2 Vect was developed. A general representation for 2 Vect is described. This involves extending basic linear algebra operations to handle matrices of zero-dimension and 2 -matrices (matrices of matrices). Then, representations for the 0 -cells, 1 -cells, and 2 -cells of 2 Vect are found. Due to the chosen representation, various structural isomorphisms are required to ensure equations expected of 1 -categories hold in the 2 -categories setting. These structural isomorphisms are explicitly constructed. In order to identify special categories, such as modular tensor <b>categories,</b> <b>a</b> diagrammatic language of monoidal categories is extended for 2 -categories. This language is used to construct the axioms for these special categories within 2 Vect. Finally, a way of implementing these axioms within 2 Vect in the computer algebra system is described. This system will now be used for the investigation of higher-level structures within modular tensor categories to better understand the structure of topological quantum computing. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Differences in facial {{height and}} breadth between Okinawa Islanders and {{mainland}} Japanese {{have been reported}} in previous craniometric and somatometric studies. This study using three-dimensional (3 D) images aimed to identify more detailed characteristics of facial morphology in each population. METHODS: Using a hand-held 3 D scanner, we obtained 60 facial surface images each from Okinawa Islanders and mainland Japanese. Twenty-one landmarks were plotted on <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> and <b>27</b> measurements of distances and angles between the landmarks were taken. Statistical analyses such as t test, principal component analysis (PCA), regression analysis, and discriminant analysis were performed to identify sex and regional differences, the patterns of facial features, factors explaining the facial patterns, and other features. RESULTS: Okinawa Islanders showed lower facial and nasal heights than mainland Japanese. Furthermore, we identified larger protrusions of the glabella and nasal root in Okinawa Islanders than in mainland Japanese. In the PCA, we observed components of facial shape patterns. These components mainly represented facial size (PC 1), facial depth (PC 2), the prominence of the glabella and nasal root (PC 3), and facial breadth (PC 4). We identified that the population difference is strongly associated with PC 3. CONCLUSIONS: This study quantitatively identified differences in the facial morphology between Okinawa Islanders and mainland Japanese using 3 D digital images, with special emphases on the differences in the nasal height and the prominence of the glabella and nasal root...|$|R

5000|$|For a {{while the}} VAX-11/780 {{was used as a}} {{standard}} in CPU benchmarks. It was initially described as a one-MIPS machine, because its performance was equivalent to an IBM System/360 that ran at one MIPS, and the System/360 implementations had previously been de facto performance standards. The actual number of instructions executed in 1 second was about 500,000, which led to complaints of marketing exaggeration. The result was the definition of a [...] "VAX MIPS," [...] the speed of <b>a</b> VAX-11/780; <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> performing at <b>27</b> VAX MIPS would run the same program roughly 27 times faster than the VAX-11/780. Within the Digital community the term VUP (VAX Unit of Performance) was the more common term, because MIPS do not compare well across different architectures. The related term cluster VUPs was informally used to describe the aggregate performance of a VAXcluster. (The performance of the VAX-11/780 still serves as the baseline metric in the BRL-CAD Benchmark, a performance analysis suite included in the BRL-CAD solid modeling software distribution.) The VAX-11/780 included a subordinate stand-alone LSI-11 computer that performed microcode load, booting, and diagnostic functions for the parent computer. This was dropped from subsequent VAX models. Enterprising VAX-11/780 users could therefore run three different Digital Equipment Corporation operating systems: VMS on the VAX processor, and either RSX-11M or RT-11 on the LSI-11.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} {{to examine the effects of}} early orientation of counseling related students to the two most prevalent paradigms of psychodiagnostic decision-making on first, the integration of the model, and second, on the ability to make proficient diagnostic decisions while in training. Using an experimental, pretest posttest design, 60 participants from two higher educational sites were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. Participants in each group were oriented to one of two treatment conditions [...] a binary decision tree model or a problem-solving model (multiple competing hypotheses). Participants were then introduced to DSM Axis II diagnostic <b>categories</b> utilizing <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> assisted learning laboratory. Results suggested that participants learned diagnosis during the experiment. However, no significant difference in diagnostic proficiency occurred as a result of the two treatment conditions. Additional analyses raised questions about use of case studies as a means of assessing diagnostic proficiency. Item difficulty appeared to be linked to diagnostic clusters and individual diagnoses. Item difficulty factors influenced the internal consistency and validity of test instruments. The assumption of the unidimensial weight of syndromes in the construction of assessment instruments is suspect. Considering the preponderance of case study use for counselor training assessment, caution during instrument construction and use is advised. Evidence also existed that treatment groups responded differently to particular DSM diagnostic clusters and items. This suggested that cluster and item difficulty may be important to consider for instruction of diagnosis in the classroom. Results also suggested that as diagnoses become more complex, problem-solving diagnostic decision-making may become more important. Secondary analysis of computer assisted learning resulted in significant evidence that nonsequential, user-friendly computer assisted instruction may overcome teaching-study style mismatch, resulting in more even distribution of learning over the sample population...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1984 The {{research}} {{reported in}} this dissertation {{has been based on}} the idea that a cartographic line is a probabilistic representation of the geographic feature which it symbolizes. Numeric parameters have been measured for two orders of structural relationships, and these parameters have been shown to provide significant distinctions between categories of cartographic line structure. The categories which have been developed are not intended as an exhaustive typology of line structure, but rather to demonstrate that meaningful categories of graphic structure can be defined numerically, and statistically verified. Categories for both orders of structure have been summarized graphically, as structure signatures, and digitally, by storing parameters for each <b>category</b> as <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> look-up table. Structure signatures can be applied to cartographic line generalization in several ways which utilize the digital look-up tables. One application involves generating lines of predictable graphic structure, by stochastic modelling techniques. The other application does not serve to generate line structures, but to identify them, to provide a means by which threshold criteria may be automatically set and modified during computer generalization. Line identification proceeds by matching measured parameters against parameters stored in the look-up tables. A possible problem arises when a line is identified which does not match any of the existing structure categories. An algorithm is presented which has the flexibility to incorporate new structures into an existing knowledge base, in effect, to learn new structures, and to become more proficient in line identification over time. Intelligent algorithms have been developed for pattern recognition by other authors, but the contribution of this research is to provide an intelligent algorithm for a specifically cartographic task, the automated modification of tolerance criteria during line generalization...|$|R

40|$|The {{idea that}} <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> can {{understand}} natural language text is examined {{in relation to}} its ability to conceptualize it.

40|$|Monoidal <b>computer</b> is <b>a</b> {{categorical}} {{model of}} intensional computation, where many different programs {{correspond to the}} same input-output behavior. The upshot of yet another model of computation is that a categorical formalism should provide a much needed high level language for theory of computation, flexible enough to allow abstracting away the low level implementation details when they are irrelevant, or taking them into account when they are genuinely needed. A salient feature of the approach through monoidal categories is the formal graphical language of string diagrams, which supports visual reasoning about programs and computations. In the present paper, we provide a coalgebraic characterization of monoidal computer. It {{turns out that the}} availability of interpreters and specializers, that make <b>a</b> monoidal <b>category</b> into <b>a</b> monoidal <b>computer,</b> is equivalent with the existence of a *universal state space*, that carries a weakly final state machine for any pair of input and output types.
