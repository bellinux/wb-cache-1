2500|$|In 1906, the Court {{asserted}} {{its original}} jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for {{contempt of court}} in United States v. Shipp. The resulting proceeding remains the only contempt proceeding and only criminal trial in the Court's history. The contempt proceeding arose from the lynching of Ed Johnson in Chattanooga, Tennessee the evening after Justice John Marshall Harlan granted Johnson a stay of execution to allow his lawyers to file an appeal. Johnson was removed from his jail cell by a lynch mob—aided by the local sheriff who left the prison virtually unguarded—and hung from a bridge, after which a deputy sheriff pinned a note on Johnson's body reading: [...] "To Justice Harlan. <b>Come</b> <b>get</b> your nigger now." [...] The local sheriff, John Shipp, cited the Supreme Court's intervention as {{the rationale for the}} lynching. The Court appointed its deputy clerk as special master to preside over the trial in Chattanooga with closing arguments made in Washington before the Supreme Court justices, who found nine individuals guilty of contempt, sentencing three to 90 days in jail and the rest to 60 days in jail.|$|E
