The current study examined survey response data from over two thousand university students to clarify potential interactive effects that measures of an individual’s self-control and ethical beliefs might have on the relationship between social learning and music piracy. The results indicated that self-control conditioned the effect that differential association and differential reinforcement had on levels of music piracy.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of <b>computer-related</b> <b>crime.</b> Nine varieties of crime are considered: theft of services; communications in furtherance of criminal conspiracies; information piracy and forgery; the dissemination of offensive materials (including extortion threats); electronic money laundering; electronic vandalism and terrorism; telemarketing fraud; illegal interception; and electronic funds transfer fraud. <b>Computer-related</b> <b>crime,</b> like crime in general, may be explained by the conjunction of three factors, motivation, opportunity and the absence of capable guardianship. Motivations will vary depending {{on the nature of the}} crime in question, but may include greed, lust, revenge, challenge or adventure. Opportunities are expanding dramatically with the rapid proliferation and penetration of digital technology. Significant challenges are posed by the transnational nature of much computer crime. The most appropriate strategies for the control of <b>computer-related</b> <b>crime</b> entails a mixture of law enforcement, technological and market-based solutions. The pursuit of a strict enforcement agenda is, in most cases not feasible because of the limited capacity of the state. Over-regulation, moreover, may stifle commercial and technological development.

40|$|Abstract—The {{concept of}} {{offender}} profiling in computerrelated crime {{is in its}} infancy. Virtually no research exists that relates offender profiling explicitly to cyber crimes or cyber criminals. Yet it cannot be denied that, given the breadth of potential suspects in a cyber event, some method of reducing that number to a manageable level followed by the ability to identify {{a small number of}} credible suspects is very desirable. Today, much cyber crime is treated by the criminal justice system as special cases of physical crime. There is little argument, however, that there are aspects of <b>computer-related</b> <b>crimes</b> and the criminals who perpetrate them that are unique to the virtual, rather than the physical world. The research described in this paper seeks to establish criteria for analyzing cyber crimes and criminals in the clear, unambiguous context of the virtual world. The authors have hypothesized four general classes of computer-related crime: 1) theft, 2) system attack, 3) personal and 4) terrorism. This paper discusses a specific aspect of the personal class of cyber crime: cyber stalking. The four sub-types discussed are the result of decades of empirical application comprising thousands of cases in the physical world. They have proven reliable in investigation of violent crimes such as rape and murder. An underlying purpose in the current research is application of the sub-types in cyber investigation. This is a “research-in-progress ” paper, presenting a hypothesis that will be tested empirically in the next phase of the research. However, we present an exemplar case with which we illustrate the potential use of the profiling techniques presented...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the first commercial computer into the U. S. business world in the early 50 s, the use of computers has grown tremendously.

40|$|M. Comm. Soon {{after the}} {{introduction}} of the automobile in the early 201 h century, the number of crimes doubled. The projection for the future is that the computer might produce an impact for law and law enforcement greater than that created by the invention of the motor car. Experts agree that computer crime will be the single greatest crime generator of the 21 st century (Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, 1999 : 1). Although the advances in technology have an impact on all walks of life, this short dissertation will focus on the effects thereof on crime in the workplace. Electronic commerce touches all major aspects of economic life and presents a series of complex issues. It involves the integration of many elements of technology, infrastructure, business operation and public policy. All these elements need to operate together as smoothly as possible to yield the maximum benefits to the public (South Africa, 2000), and all other stakeholders. Today very few business organisations and government departments have business information systems that are not computer based. More and more organisations connect to the Internet to conduct their business and/or to provide a variety of services. Computer-based crimes have now {{become a part of the}} general problem of white-collar crime. The problem of fraud, or white-collar crime, is serious. Statistics have shown that corporate losses due to fraud and embezzlement exceed total losses due to bribery, burglary and shoplifting by a wide margin (Bodnar & Hopwood 1998 : 218). The introduction of networks, and specifically the Internet, has exacerbated this problem. Pincott (2001 : 76) found that fraud costs firms an estimated GBP 40 million a day and is a factor in 30 per cent of all insolvencies. As the complexity and global pervasiveness of fraud escalates, a new survey concludes that managements are failing both to implement preventive measures and to address the issue once an offence has occurred (Anon., 2000 : 11 }. There is a lack of common understanding of <b>computer-related</b> <b>crimes</b> and more research into the field is required...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we aim to}} briefly {{overview}} recent developments and trends in 'cybercrime'. A number of criterion may be applied to gauge prominence or salience of the particular forms of cybercrime now manifest. These include the prevalence (including frequency of specific forms) of the crime among the population or a particular sub-population (including a geographical area or commercial arena), duration (the intensity or persistence of the problem) and finally the severity (harm or gravity of the offence) of the cybercrime. In order to prioritize the most prominent forms of cybercrime these basic measurements are required – {{for the most part}} cybercrime eludes the kinds of measurement we may need in order to perceive either trends in certain forms or assess the seriousness of the different types of cybercrime. For example, what is the relevant importance of persistent spamming in comparison to the occasional virus? Or occasional theft like intrusion offences versus a complex payment card duplication activity (carding) ? Of course the priorities will to some extent depend on the circumstances and on what standpoint is taken – the victim, public police, and the information communication technology (ICT) industry. At present law enforcement agencies around the world struggle to assess the relative risks of the various forms of cyber crime now encountered. One hurdle to this necessary assessment is the problem of the classification of the different forms of cybercrime. Such a formal or even a provisional classification of cybercrime has proven elusive despite the benefits this would yield in assessing the relative risks of the different forms of cybercrime. The lack of a classification system is a significant handicap and {{may be due to the}} considerable confusion that occurs around the very notion of what constitutes 'cybercrime' or <b>computer-related</b> <b>crime</b> and indeed whether it is new or old crime in new bottles...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} in <b>computer-related</b> <b>crime</b> has caused {{law enforcement agencies}} to seize digital evidence {{in the form of}} network logs, text documents, videos, and images. However, digital evidence normally does not come in a complete form. Therefore, in many cases forensic analysts have to investigate a piece of data, such as a disk block or a network packet, to identify the file type of the data so that they can retrieve necessary information from that piece of data. Much research effort has been made to solve this problem. However, there is no approach referred to in the literature that can bring high identification rates for most of the file types. This research project focuses on identifying file type for high entropy file fragments which are parts of widely used file formats. Particularly, the research aims at considering file fragments which share the same compression method, namely deflate algorithm. It is shown that sharing the same encoding method makes the problem of file fragment identification more severe; because compression algorithms eliminate statistical features {{that can be used to}} distinguish between different file types. Deflate-encoded data must be detected then decompressed to retrieve the underlying data which have discernible patterns and these patterns are then combined with pattern recognition techniques to identify the file types of file fragments. This thesis also exploits entropy which is a measurement to evaluate the randomness of data. Entropy is used to cluster file fragments into three groups. In each group, all data fragments have the same entropy value range of either low, medium or high. Different pattern recognition models and different features are built to identify the file type for executable, PDF compound and PNG image file formats. Evaluation experiments performed on the public dataset Govdocs 1 and other datasets show very good results in term of detection accuracy for proposed techniques. In digital forensics, practical tools are crucial. The experiments also show that the proposed methods can be implemented for real life applications...|$|E
