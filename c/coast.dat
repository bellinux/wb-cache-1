5|$|According to the Azores High hypothesis, an anti-phase {{pattern is}} {{expected}} to exist between the Gulf of Mexico <b>coast</b> and the Atlantic <b>coast.</b> During the quiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic <b>coast.</b> During the hyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf <b>coast</b> as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP, and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf <b>coast.</b> Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic <b>coast</b> seem to support the Azores High hypothesis.

5|$|After the <b>Coast</b> Guard Act 1978 {{came into}} force on 19 August 1978, the first Director General was {{appointed}} {{on the same}} day. Vice Admiral V. A.

Traditionally, appointees to the DG position have come from the Indian Navy, although the current office holder, Rajendra Singh, is a direct entry <b>Coast</b> Guard officer. While several previous Directors General have come from the <b>Coast</b> Guard stream – such as Rameshwar Singh and P.

During World War I, Hispanics served in the United States Revenue Cutter Service and U.S. Life-Saving Service; and during World War II, Hispanics served aboard ships guarding the shores of the United States and the Atlantic Ocean against enemy submarines. However some men, such as Jose R. Zaragoza, served on missions on lonely atolls. Hispanics have served in every major conflict, and continue to do so. <b>Coast</b> guard service is not limited to armed conflicts with other nations; the <b>Coast</b> Guard also plays a vital role in the apprehension of illegal immigrants and drug smugglers.|$|E

40|$|Coastal {{vegetation}} comprises {{a number}} of coastal specialists and terrestrial generalists. It remains unclear how they persist on disturbed and undisturbed coastal conditions. We tested the hypothesis that coastal specialists may be superior to terrestrial generalists on supratidal zones of <b>coasts,</b> but their superiority can be influenced by human disturbances. Eight separate sandy <b>coasts</b> of the Shandong Peninsula were sampled, representing for disturbed and undisturbed sandy <b>coasts.</b> Plants growing on their supratidal zones were surveyed. On this basis, we compared the relative dominances, niche widths, and commonness of all species, and also analyzed species diversities of the <b>coasts.</b> Coastal specialists {{were found to be}} more common and widespread on supratidal zones of the sandy <b>coasts</b> than terrestrial generalists haphazardly invading from hinterlands. Coastal specialists exhibited lower Sørensen dissimilarities than terrestrial generalists among the <b>coasts.</b> Tourist trampling seemed more detrimental than pond fishery to coastal vegetation. Relative to terrestrial generalists, coastal specialists responded to human disturbances more deterministically, with steady decreases in species diversities. These evidences verify that coastal specialists are intrinsically superior to terrestrial generalists on supratidal zones of <b>coasts,</b> especially of undisturbed <b>coasts,</b> because their dispersal among <b>coasts</b> adapts well to local storm surge regime. They also validate that human disturbances can depress the superiority of coastal specialists, partly by inducing invasion of terrestrial generalists...|$|R
