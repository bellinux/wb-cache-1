The cottage marked the place where gates once stood across the Barnsley and Shepley Lane Head Turnpike which was built by Blind Jack of Knaresborough in 1825 {{following}} an Act of Parliament passed two years earlier. Another Turnpike between Saddleworth and Shepley Lane Head via Holmfirth was constructed around this time, having been surveyed by Thomas Dinsley in 1819. As {{the name of the}} building suggests, a toll was collected at this point from travellers. The tolls were abolished on 1 August 1875.|$|E
25|$|The film's soundtrack debuted {{at number}} 8 and later jumped up to number 5 during its second week.

Along North Bush, NY399 passed a cemetery and local radio tower. Bending along a curve around the hill, the route reached a junction with McGregor Road, reaching the junction with Fulton Street Extension, where it turned northeast around another hill. After turning eastward, the route reached the hamlet of Meco, where it met a junction with NY29A, which marked the eastern terminus of NY399.|$|E

25|$|Coming {{off their}} disappointing playoff loss, the Stars would {{get off to}} a shaky start to the 2003–04 season, as they played mediocre hockey through {{the first three months of}} the season, posting a sub-.500 record. As the {{calendar}} turned to 2004, however, the Stars began to find their game, as they posted a 9–4–3 record in January. As the season wore on, the Stars would get stronger, <b>climbing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> playoff ladder and eventually reaching second place in the Pacific Division, where they finished with a solid 41–26–13–2 record; Marty Turco had another outstanding season, recording a 1.98 GAA. However, the Stars could not carry their momentum into the playoffs, as they were beaten by the Colorado Avalanche in five games in the first round.|$|E
25|$|The route <b>climbing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hill is also tricky and {{has seen}} a few {{accidents}} resulting in fatalities. In 2008, a private bus fell into the valley while navigating along a U-turn resulting in deaths of 43 people. Post this incident, a few measures {{have been taken to}} prevent such accidents, like erection of barricades and warning signs. Toll collection has also started {{at the foot of the}} hill to financially provide for these measures. The measures taken were still reported to be insufficient in a news report by Sakal in 2010. Being a site of mass gathering on various occasions, the temple is also listed on the hit-list of terrorists. Mock drills of emergency situations are conducted by State police.|$|E
25|$|Traverse: Crossing the {{mountain}} {{as part of}} a three-day ascent of Mont Blanc involves <b>climbing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> south ridge of the Aiguille de Bionnassay from the Col de Miage, then descending from the summit down its razor-sharp, icy, and often corniced east (frontier) ridge. From there the route climbs again up the west ridge of the Dome du Gouter, past the Vallot Hut, to reach the Bosses ridge and thence to the summit of Mont Blanc. The route has been described as 'a truly magical expedition of ice and snow aretes at great altitude'. The Durier Hut on the Col de Miage can either be reached directly from the village of Tresse via an increasingly broken slope of scree in its upper reaches, or via a traverse from the Conscrits Hut over the Dômes de Miage.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} meet this Union threat, Longstreet {{developed}} a plan, whereby he would command the gap from the high ground on either side and then outflank the Union position on the eastern ridge. The 9th Georgia from Col. George T. Anderson's brigade was sent to Chapman's Mill {{on the east side}} of the gap to repulse a Federal attack by the 11th Pennsylvania, who ironically, to reach the gap, had to remove the trees felled by Wyndham earlier that morning. The impediment allowed Anderson to send half of his brigade up to the slope to the north of the gap to occupy the high ground while still having sufficient men to repulse the 11th Pennsylvania. To the south of the gap, the 2nd and 20th Georgia regiments from Henry Benning's brigade raced up the slopes on the west against the 13th Massachusetts, <b>climbing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> east side. The Georgians won out and drove the 13th Massachusetts back down the steep slopes.|$|E
25|$|Audleya large, {{flat area}} {{at the base of}} one of the larger valleys in the park. The main road into the park from the north drops quickly from the heights to Audley, where it crosses the Hacking River on a weir before <b>climbing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> other side of the valley to {{continue}} further into the park. Audley was developed in the late 19th century as a picnic area for Sydneysiders on a day trip. A large, heritage listed timber boathouse from that time still exists on the western bank of the weir and currently rents rowing boats and canoes to allow leisurely exploration of {{the upper reaches of the}} river. It also rents mountain bikes. A timber dance hall built in the early 20th century on the eastern bank is available for functions. Large picnic areas, grassy meadows and a café, rest rooms and a colony of hungry ducks complete the picnic picture. Audley is as popular with families today as it was in the 19th century. After a heavy rain the weir floods, closing the road and forcing the residents of Bundeena to drive an extra 30 kilometres to the southern end of the park if they wish to drive to Sydney.|$|E
25|$|While {{the season}} was over in the Champions League, Neptūnas went on a win streak in the LKL, <b>climbing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> standings. They {{finished}} the regular season in fourth seed with 21 victories and 15 defeats balance. During the 2016–17 LKL Playoffs quarter-final Neptūnas eliminated Juventus Utena 3–0, and advanced into the semi-finals where they faced Lithuanian champions Žalgiris Kaunas. Game 1 of the series did not provide much intrigue in Kaunas, with Žalgiris desperately crushing Neptūnas 83–54. The view was completely different during Game 2 in Klaipėda where Neptūnas defeated Žalgiris 73–70 to even the series 1–1. In Kaunas, Žalgiris won again, 83:60 and finished the series in Klaipėda, where Neptūnas lost the game 53:69 and the series 1-3. During the LKL bronze final Neptūnas faced Lietuvos rytas Vilnius for the intense series. Both teams successfully defended their home courts with Neptūnas losing the opening game on May 29, 2017 in Vilnius 79–60, but revening 83–70 on June 1 in Klaipėda. Later the series continued {{in the same order}} with Lietuvos rytas defeating Neptūnas 71–54 {{for the second time in}} Vilnius on June 4, and Neptūnas doing the same 70–65 in Klaipėda on June 7 to force the Game 5 of the series. Neptūnas lost the series on June 10 in Vilnius after losing the crucial game 75–66 and the series 3–2, mostly because of two former Neptūnas players Jimmy Baron and Deividas Gailius who combined for more than a half of Rytas' points (39). A very promising season at the beginning ended on a very disappointing note.|$|E
