50|$|Many {{colocation}} facilities {{can provide}} redundant, A and B power feeds to <b>customer</b> <b>equipment,</b> and high end servers and telecommunications equipment often can have two power supplies installed.|$|E
5000|$|Access devices {{normally}} {{exist at}} a customer's premises, unit, or wireless base station. This is the network that connects <b>customer</b> <b>equipment,</b> and may include optical network terminal (ONT), a residential gateway, or office router.|$|E
50|$|<b>Customer</b> <b>equipment</b> {{installed}} {{before these}} upgrades {{will all be}} single phase, and can be reused after the upgrade. If small amounts of three-phase power are needed, it can be economically synthesized from two-phase power with on-site equipment.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, the NT1 is {{considered}} customer-premises equipment (CPE) and is as such generally {{provided by the}} customer or integrated into the <b>customer's</b> <b>equipment.</b> In this case, the U interface is the termination point of the ISDN network. In Europe, the NT1 is generally provided by the provider, and the S/T is the termination point of the ISDN network.|$|R

50|$|The Metered Supply Point (MSP) is {{the point}} at which the meter {{measuring}} a customer's consumption is located. It is thus also {{the point at which}} either the distribution network operator's supply, or the building network operator's lateral cable terminates and the <b>customer's</b> <b>equipment</b> begins. In order to firmly establish a supply's MSP, the MPAN needs to be associated with a meter serial number.|$|R
50|$|Network Termination 1 (NT1) or Network Termination type 1 {{refers to}} {{equipment}} in an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) that physically and electrically terminates the network at the customer's premises. The NT1 network termination provides signal conversion and timing functions which correspond to layer 1 of the OSI model. In a Basic Rate Interface, the NT1 connects to line termination (LT) {{equipment in the}} provider's telephone exchange via the local loop two wire U interface and to <b>customer</b> <b>equipment</b> via the four wire S interface or T interface. The S and T interfaces are electrically equivalent, and the <b>customer</b> <b>equipment</b> port of a NT1 is often labelled as S/T interface. There are many types of NT1 available.|$|E
50|$|These {{alarm states}} are also lumped under the term Carrier Group Alarm (CGA). The meaning of CGA is that {{connectivity}} on the digital carrier has failed. The {{result of the}} CGA condition varies depending on the equipment function. Voice equipment typically coerces the robbed bits for signaling to a state {{that will result in}} the far end properly handling the condition, while applying an often different state to the <b>customer</b> <b>equipment</b> connected to the alarmed equipment. Simultaneously, the customer data is often coerced to a 0x7F pattern, signifying a zero-voltage condition on voice equipment. Data equipment usually passes whatever data may be present, if any, leaving it to the <b>customer</b> <b>equipment</b> to deal with the condition.|$|E
50|$|A smartjack {{may provide}} signal conversion, {{converting}} codes and protocols (e.g. framing types) {{to the type}} needed by the <b>customer</b> <b>equipment.</b> It may buffer and/or regenerate the signal, to compensate for signal degradation from line transmission, similar to what a repeater does.|$|E

50|$|Additional smartjack {{diagnostic}} capabilities include {{alarm indication}} signal, which reports trouble {{at one end}} of the line to the far end. This helps the telephone company know if trouble is present in the line, the smartjack, or <b>customer</b> <b>equipment.</b> Indicator lights to show configuration, status, and alarms are also common.|$|E
50|$|If an ISP deploys a CGN, {{and uses}} RFC 1918 address space to number their customers, {{there is a}} risk that <b>customer</b> <b>equipment</b> already using RFC 1918 space will stop working. The reason is that routing and NAT will not work if the same {{addresses}} occur on both inside and outside network interfaces.|$|E

They include ISO / IEC 27001:2005 and 27001:2013 Information Security Management System Standard, related to information and physical security and business continuity, and the PCI-DSS Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, related to physical security access to <b>customer</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E

Much of Southern California {{operated on}} 50 Hz {{and did not}} completely change frequency of their generators and <b>customer</b> <b>equipment</b> to 60 Hz until around 1948. Some projects by the Au Sable Electric Company used 30 Hz at transmission voltages up to 110,000 volts in 1914.|$|E

50|$|Customer-premises {{equipment}} or customer-provided equipment (CPE) is any terminal and associated equipment located at a subscriber's premises and {{connected with a}} carrier's telecommunication channel at the demarcation point ("demarc"). The demarc is a point established in a building or complex to separate <b>customer</b> <b>equipment</b> from the equipment located in either the distribution infrastructure or central office of the communications service provider.|$|E

5000|$|In 1899, the Berliner Elektrizitäts-Werke (BEW), a Berlin {{electrical}} utility, {{decided to}} greatly increase its distribution capacity by switching to 220 volt nominal distribution, {{taking advantage of}} the higher voltage capability of newly developed metal filament lamps. The company was able to offset the cost of converting the <b>customer's</b> <b>equipment</b> by the resulting saving in distribution conductors cost. This became the model for electrical distribution in Germany and the rest of Europe and the 220-volt system became common. North American practice remained with voltages near 110 volts for lamps.|$|R

50|$|In some DSL {{variations}} (for example, HDSL), {{the terminal}} adapter connects {{directly to the}} computer via a serial interface, using protocols such as ethernet or V.35. In other cases (particularly ADSL), {{it is common for}} the <b>customer</b> <b>equipment</b> to be integrated with higher level functionality, such as routing, firewalling, or other application-specific hardware and software. In this case, the equipment is referred to as a gateway.|$|E
50|$|In IP telephony, no such {{direct link}} between {{location}} and communications end point exists. Even a provider having hardware infrastructure, such as a DSL provider, may only know the approximate location of the device, based on the IP address allocated to the network router and the known service address. However, some ISPs do not track the automatic assignment of IP addresses to <b>customer</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Soon enough, <b>customer</b> <b>equipment,</b> [...] "selective call", was {{developed}} {{that had a}} built-in circuit that could be programmed to recognize a five-digit code as its own, {{in a manner similar}} to IMTS systems and crude compared to cellular phones. The phone company would assign the customer a number and the customer would have it programmed into the set by the phone company or by a dealer.|$|E

50|$|ITU G.992.3 is an ITU (International Telecommunication Union) standard, also {{referred}} to as ADSL2 or G.dmt.bis. It optionally extends the capability of basic ADSL in data rates to 12 Mbit/s downstream and, depending on Annex version, up to 3.5 Mbit/s upstream (with a mandatory capability of ADSL2 transceivers of 8 Mbit/s downstream and 800 kbit/s upstream). ADSL2 uses the same bandwidth as ADSL but achieves higher throughput via improved modulation techniques. Actual speeds may decrease depending on line quality; usually the most significant factor in line quality is the distance from the DSLAM to the <b>customer's</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
