40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{goal was}} to develop a quantifiable, {{self-assessment}} health-related quality of life (QoL) instrument for use in cochlear implant (CI) users. DESIGN: Three principal domains were distinguished: physical, psychological, and social. Forty-five postlingually deaf adult multichannel CI users and 46 deaf candidates on the waiting list for <b>CIs</b> (<b>control</b> group) participated in the study. RESULTS: Retrospective scores for the CI group corresponded very well with the scores for the control group. Current QoL scores were substantially higher for all 6 subdomains. Internal consistency and testretest reliability coefficients proved to be satisfactory, and the ability to detect clinical changes with the Nijmegen Cochlear Implantation Questionnaire (NCIQ) proved to be good. CONCLUSIONS: The psychometric characteristics of the NCIQ proved to be reliable and probably valid and sensitive to clinical changes. The data obtained with the NCIQ reflected that the instrument was able to detect that a CI had significant effects on several health-related QoL aspects, including the social and psychological domains...|$|E

We also examined the <b>cis</b> <b>control</b> regions by constructing a series of transgenic plants that carry green fluorescent protein {{under the control of the}} FIL promoter with several types of deletions, base changes, and tandem repeats and showed that the unique expression pattern is dependent on at least two cis-acting elements in the 5 ′ regulatory region.

40|$|SummaryRiboswitches are RNA {{elements}} {{acting in}} <b>cis,</b> <b>controlling</b> expression of their downstream genes through a metabolite-induced alteration of their secondary structure. Here, we demonstrate that two S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) riboswitches, SreA and SreB, can also function in trans {{and act as}} noncoding RNAs in Listeria monocytogenes. SreA and SreB control expression of the virulence regulator PrfA by binding to the 5 ′-untranslated region of its mRNA. Absence of the SAM riboswitches SreA and SreB increases the level of PrfA and virulence gene expression in L. monocytogenes.

40|$|A novel {{methodology}} {{is described}} in which transcriptomics is combined with the measurement of bread-making quality and other agronomic traits for wheat genotypes grown in different environments (wet and cool or hot and dry conditions) to identify transcripts associated with these traits. Seven doubled haploid lines from the Spark ? Rialto mapping population were selected to be matched for development and known alleles affecting quality. These were grown in polytunnels with different environments applied 14 days post-anthesis, and the whole experiment was repeated over 2 years. Transcriptomics using the wheat Affymetrix chip was carried out on whole caryopsis samples at two stages during grain filling. Transcript abundance was correlated with the traits for approximately 400 transcripts. About 30 of these were selected as being of most interest, and markers were derived from them and mapped using the population. Expression was identified as being under <b>cis</b> <b>control</b> for 11 of these and under trans control for 18.

40|$|An UGA {{stop codon}} context which is inefficient {{because of the}} 3 ′-flanking context and the last two amino acids in the gene protein product has a {{negative}} effect on gene expression, as shown using a model protein A′ gene. This is particularly true at low mRNA levels, corresponding to a high intracellular ribosome/mRNA ratio. The negative effect is smaller if this ratio is decreased, or if the distance between the initiation and termination signals is increased. The results suggest that an inefficient termination codon can cause ribosomal pausing and queuing along the upstream mRNA region, thus blocking translation initiation of short genes. This <b>cis</b> <b>control</b> effect is dependent on the stop codon context, including the C-terminal amino acids in the gene product, the translation initiation signal strength, the ribosome/mRNA ratio {{and the size of the}} mRNA coding region.

The two issues of gene-specific <b>cis</b> <b>control</b> and genomic position can be studied by determining the extent of dosage compensation of a transposable element at different chromosomal locations. To determine whether the multicopy copia transposable element can dosage compensate, we used the X-linked white-apricot (w(a)) mutation in which a copia element is present. The extent of dosage compensation was determined for the white and copia promoters in larvae and adults in two different genomic locations of the w(a) allele. We conclude that copia is able to dosage compensate, and that the white promoter and the copia promoter are not coordinate in their dosage compensation abilities when assayed under these various conditions. Thus, two transcriptional units, one within the other, {{both of which are}} able to dosage compensate, do so differently in response to developmental stage and genomic position...|$|E

This review describes four new interventions aimed at reducing fall risk in older adults by promoting more effective CIS reactions: (1) balance training, (2) balance-enhancing footwear, (3) safer mobility aids, and (4) handrail cueing systems. The training program uses unpredictable support-surface perturbations to counter specific <b>CIS</b> <b>control</b> problems associated with aging and fall risk. Pilot testing has demonstrated that the program is well-tolerated by balance-impaired older adults, and a randomized controlled trial is now in progress. The balance-enhancing footwear insole improves control of stepping reactions by compensating for age-related loss of plantar cutaneous sensation. In a clinical trial, subjects wore the insole for 12 weeks with no serious problems and no habituation of the balance-enhancing benefits. The mobility-aid intervention involves changes to the design of pickup walkers so as to reduce impediments to lateral stepping. Finally, work is underway to investigate the effectiveness of handrail cueing in attracting attention to the rail and ensuring that the brain registers its location, thereby facilitating more rapid and accurate grasping...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that altered levels or function of alpha-haemoglobin stabilising protein (AHSP), an erythroid-specific protein that binds specifically to free alpha-(haemo) globin, might account for some of the clinical variability in beta-thalassaemia. To assess the variation of AHSP expression, mRNA levels in circulating reticulocytes of 103 healthy individuals were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. AHSP expression varied up to threefold, and did not correlate with age or sex. A systematic survey of the AHSP locus identified eight sequence variants, of which six were common. Four common variants, including the longer homopolymer (T 18) in the putative promoter, are strongly associated with AHSP expression. Reporter assays in K 562 cells showed that the activity of the shorter (T 15) reporter was relatively lower than that of the T 18 reporter. In a study of nine anaemic patients who were heterozygous for beta-thalassaemia and also heterozygous for the triplicated alpha-globin gene (alpha alpha alpha/alpha alpha), frequency of the shorter homopolymer was higher than expected. AHSP expression is variable, with <b>cis</b> <b>control</b> accounting for some of its variance. In some families, the subtle altered levels in AHSP related to the AHSP genotype appears to be a relevant contributory factor in the haematological phenotype...|$|E

This chromosome, which carries the {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) originated from a human B cell which expresses class I and class II MHC antigens. EC cells do not express class I or class II antigens on their cell surface. Northern blot analysis has now shown that in the MCP 6 hybrid, human class I genes, i. e., HLA-A,B,C, continued to be transcribed, and cellular levels of the transcripts were similar to, or only slightly lower than, levels in hybrids with a non-EC phenotype. However, very low levels of mRNA species recognised by a mouse class I gene (H- 2) probe were also detected in EC cells and EC hybrids. Comparison of the relative levels of H- 2 and HLA class I gene transcripts in the EC hybrids and non-EC hybrids indicated that the introduced HLA-A,B,C genes were not appropriately regulated in the EC cell but were subject {{at least in part}} to <b>cis</b> <b>control.</b> In contrast to the class I genes, no class II gene (i. e.

Women who had used OCs had an increased risk of CIS compared with those who had never used OCs (relative risk, 1. 6; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 2 to 2. 2). However, further analyses indicated that this increased risk was confined to those who had recently used OCs. Also, the risk of CIS was not elevated in subgroups in which a history of cervical smears was not strongly linked to OC use.

Copy number variation (CNV) is an important type of genomic variation, but CNV profiling from whole-exome sequencing (WES) is challenging due to the high level of biases and artifacts. We propose CODEX, a normalization and CNV calling procedure for WES data. CODEX includes a Poisson latent factor model, which includes terms that specifically remove biases due to GC content, exon capture and amplification efficiency, and latent systemic artifacts. CODEX also includes a Poisson likelihood-based segmentation procedure that explicitly models the count-based WES data. CODEX is compared to existing methods on germline CNV detection in HapMap samples using microarray-based gold standard and is further evaluated on 222 neuroblastoma samples with matched normal, with focus on somatic CNVs within theATRX gene. ^ Part 2 : Cancer is a disease driven by evolutionary selection on somatic genetic and epigenetic alterations. We propose Canopy, a method for inferring the evolutionary phylogeny of a tumor using both somatic copy number alterations and single nucleotide alterations from one or more samples derived from a single patient. Canopy is applied to bulk sequencing datasets of both longitudinal and spatial experimental designs and to a transplantable metastasis model derived from human cancer cell line MDA-MB- 231. Canopy successfully identifies cell populations and infers phylogenies that are in concordance with existing knowledge and ground truth.

40|$|Studies of {{bacterial}} and eukaryotic systems have identified two-gene operons {{in which the}} translation product of the upstream gene influences translation of the downstream gene. The upstream gene, {{referred to as a}} leader (gene) in bacterial systems or an upstream open reading frame (uORF) in eukaryotes, encodes a peptide that interferes with a function(s) of its translating ribosome. The peptides are therefore cis-acting negative regulators of translation. The inhibitory peptides typically consist of fewer than 25 residues and function prior to emergence from the ribosome. A biological role for this class of translation inhibitor is demonstrated in translation attenuation, a form or regulation that controls the inducible translation of the chloramphenicol resistance genes cat and cmlA in bacteria. Induction of cat or cmlA requires ribosome stalling at a particular codon in the leader region of the mRNA. Stalling destabilizes an adjacent, downstream mRNA secondary structure that normally sequesters the ribosome-binding site for the cat or cmlA coding regions. Genetic studies indicate that the nascent, leader-encoded peptide is the selector of the site of ribosome stalling in leader mRNA by cis interference with translation. Synthetic leader peptides inhibit ribosomal peptidyltransferase in vitro, leading to the prediction that this activity is the basis for stall site selection. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} leader peptides are rRNA-binding peptides with targets at the peptidyl transferase center of 23 S rRNA. uORFs associated with several eukaryotic genes inhibit downstream translation. When inhibition depends on the specific codon sequence of the uORF, it has been proposed that the uORF-encoded nascent peptide prevents ribosome release from the mRNA at the uORF stop codon. This sets up a blockade to ribosome scanning which minimizes downstream translation. Segments within large proteins also appear to regulate ribosome activity in cis, although in most of the known examples the active amino acid sequences function after their emergence from the ribosome, <b>cis</b> <b>control</b> of translation by the nascent peptide is gene specific; nearly all such regulatory peptides exert no obvious trans effects in cells. The in vitro biochemical activities of the cat/cmla leader peptides on ribosomes and rRNA suggest a mechanism through which the nascent peptide can modify ribosome behavior.

Cis dimerization of JAM-L is required to engage in heterophilic interactions with its cognate counter-receptor CAR (coxsackie and adenovirus receptor). Interestingly, JAM-L expressed on neutrophils binds CAR independently of integrin activation. However, on resting monocytes and T lymphocytes, which express the integrin VLA- 4, JAM-L molecules engage in complexes with VLA- 4 and mainly accumulate in their monomeric form. Integrin activation {{is required for the}} dissociation of JAM-L–VLA- 4 complexes and the accumulation of functional JAM-L dimers, which indicates that the leukocyte integrin VLA- 4 controls JAM-L function in <b>cis</b> by <b>controlling</b> its dimerization state. This provides a mechanism through which VLA- 4 and JAM-L functions are coordinately regulated, allowing JAM-L to strengthen integrin-dependent adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells...|$|R

We have previously shown that AtoC is the response egulator of the AtoS-AtoC two-component signal transduction system that activates atoDAEB when Escherichia coli {{is exposed to}} acetoacetate. Here, we show that the same <b>cis</b> elements <b>control</b> both promoter inducibility and AtoC binding. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the acetoacetate-inducible binding of AtoC to the predicted DNA region in vivo. DNase I protection footprinting analysis revealed that AtoC binds two 20 -bp stretches, constituting an inverted palindrome, that are located at 146 to 107 relative to the transcription initiation site. Analyses of promoter mutants obtained by in vitro chemical mutagenesis of the atoDAEB promoter verified both the importance of AtoC binding for the inducibility of the promoter by acetoacetate and the 54 dependence of atoDAEB expression. The integration host factor was also identified as {{a critical component of}} the AtoC-mediated induction of atoDAEB...|$|R

40|$|The phase {{variation}} of type 1 fimbriation in Escherichia coli {{is associated with}} the inversion of a short DNA element. This element (switch) acts in <b>cis</b> to <b>control</b> transcription of fimA, the major fimbrial subunit gene. Thus, fimA is transcribed when the switch is in one orientation (the on orientation) but not the other (the off orientation). The fim inversion requires either fimB (on-to-off or off-to-on inversion) or fimE (on-to-off inversion only), as well as integration host factor, and is also influenced by the abundant DNA-binding protein H-NS. Here we report that an additional gene, lrp, a factor known to influence the expression of both Pap and K 99 fimbriae, is also required for normal activity of the fim switch. The frequencies of both fimB-promoted and fimE-promoted inversions, and consequently the {{phase variation}} of type 1 fimbriation, are lower in lrp mutants. Lrp affects slightly the transcription of both fimB (which is increased) and fimE (which is decreased). We believe that these alterations in fimB and fimE transcription alone are unlikely to account for the sharp reduction in switching found in lrp mutants...|$|R
40|$|The {{cyanobacterium}} Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 exhibits oscillations in mRNA transcript abundance with 24 -h periodicity under {{continuous light}} conditions. The mechanism underlying these oscillations remains elusive—neither <b>cis</b> nor trans-factors <b>controlling</b> circadian gene expression phase have been identified. Here, {{we show that}} the topological status of the chromosome is highly correlated with circadian gene expression state. We also demonstrate that DNA sequence characteristics of genes that appear monotonically activated and monotonically repressed by chromosomal relaxation during the circadian cycle {{are similar to those}} of supercoiling-responsive genes in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, perturbation of superhelical status within the physiological range elicits global changes in gene expression similar to those that occur during the normal circadian cycle...|$|R
30|$|The spray {{pyrolysis}} method (SPM) is a {{very important}} non-vacuum deposition method to fabricate thin films because it is a relatively simple and inexpensive non-vacuum deposition method for large-area coating [14]. In this study, the micro-sized CIS powder was synthesized by the hydrothermal process by Nanowin Technology Co. Ltd. Because the formed CIS powder was aggregated in the micro-scale, for that we ground the CIS powder by the ball milling method. Particle-size change during process has been observed by Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns to examine the effect of adding dispersant or not and grinding time on particle size. A SPM method was used to develop the CIS absorber layers with high densification structure. However, only few efforts had been made to systematically investigate the effects of thermal-treated parameters in a selenization furnace on the physical and electrical properties of the CIS absorber layers. We would investigate the effects of annealing parameters on the physical and electrical properties of the CIS absorber layers. The feasibility of the crystalline phase <b>CIS</b> by <b>controlling</b> RTA-treated temperature and time has been checked.|$|R
