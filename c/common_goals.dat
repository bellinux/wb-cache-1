5|$|Kitsune {{are often}} {{presented}} as tricksters, with motives that vary from mischief to malevolence. Stories tell of kitsune playing tricks on overly proud samurai, greedy merchants, and boastful commoners, while the crueler ones abuse poor tradesmen and farmers or devout Buddhist monks. Their victims are usually men; women are possessed instead. For example, kitsune {{are thought to}} employ their kitsunebi to lead travelers astray {{in the manner of}} a will o' the wisp.

Finishing the game unlocks one of more than a dozen game endings, dependent on the player's actions during the game.|$|E

The cornerstone of local and regional affiliations in support of <b>common</b> <b>goals</b> was laid out to show ways to maximize the unions bargaining potential. The immediate <b>common</b> <b>goals</b> were wage and hour demands, and death and sickness benefits. The union grew from its 1881 membership of 2000, to 50,000 by 1890, and 100,000 by 1900.|$|E

25|$|First {{dates are}} {{designed}} to produce a number of relationship outcomes. (e.g., sexual partner, friendship, short-term romantic relationship, or life partnership.) However, as Mongeau says “the desired relationship outcome (if any) is, of course, not directly observable.” Mongeau quotes Theiss and Solomon, who have done many scholarly articles on dating, stating that first dates are very important because partners are both {{getting to know each}} other and attempting to establish a relationship definition as well. The three most <b>common</b> <b>goals</b> that people have on first dates are to reduce uncertainty, achieve relational escalation, and to have fun.|$|E

The governments may be based on heredity, religion, military power, work projects such as canal building, food distribution, land ownership, agriculture, commerce, manufacturing, finance, {{or a combination of}} these. Societies that live in cities are often called civilizations.|$|E

25|$|George Panu (March 9, 1848 – November 6, 1910) was a Moldavian, later Romanian memoirist, {{literary}} critic, {{journalist and}} politician. A native of Iași, educated {{there as well}} as in Paris and Brussels, he worked as a schoolteacher and lawyer, but {{made a name for himself}} in politics and journalism. His outlook was a radical one that shared <b>common</b> <b>goals</b> with the socialist movement. Noted for his bitter polemics, he served several terms in parliament, alternating between the main parties as well as heading his own small faction for nearly a decade. In the last years of his life, Panu wrote a valuable memoir detailing his experiences in the Junimea literary society, of which he had become an implacable adversary.|$|E
25|$|A seminal event {{occurred}} in August 1968, when Ceaușescu highlighted his anti-Soviet discourse by vocally opposing the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia; a highly popular measure with the Romanian public, {{it led to}} sizable enrollments in the PCR and the newly created paramilitary Patriotic Guards (created {{with the goal of}} meeting a possible Soviet intervention in Romania). From 1965 to 1976, the PCR rose from approximately 1.4million members to 2.6million. In the contingency of an anti-Soviet war, the PCR even sought an alliance with the maverick Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito—negotiations did not yield a clear result. Although military intervention in Romania was reportedly taken into consideration by the Soviets, there is indication that Leonid Brezhnev had himself ruled out Romanian participation in Warsaw Pact maneuvers, and that he continued to rely on Ceaușescu's support for other <b>common</b> <b>goals.</b>|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{the kings}} of Poland denounced the Order of holding lands {{rightfully}} theirs, specifically Chełmno Land and Polish lands that would be conquered later, such as Pomerelia (also Pomorze Gdańskie or Pomerania), Kujawy, and Dobrzyń Land. Furthermore, {{the rule of the}} Teutonic Knights was seen as increasingly anachronistic—taxes (customs) and the system of grain licenses (every trader had to pay large fees for the privilege of trading grain) hindered economic development in the province. At the same time the nobility sought a larger say in the running of the country, and were looking enviously at neighboring Poland, where the Polish nobility enjoyed wider privileges. The Knights were also accused of violating the few existing privileges of the nobility and the cities. Craftsmen were discontented because of competition from so-called partacze, or artisans settled by the Knights near their castles. Kashubians, Poles, Germans, and Prussians were slowly melting into one nation, and as national differences disappeared, the <b>common</b> <b>goals</b> of all the ethnic and social groups of Prussia became more prominent, and the Prussian estates leaned increasingly towards Poland.|$|E
