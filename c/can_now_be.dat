5|$|Before the {{construction}} of I-70 the San Rafael Swell was relatively inaccessible and not well known or explored. There were, however, a few efforts to protect the swell as early as 1935. Since {{the construction}} of the freeway the number of visitors to the swell has increased significantly, as the swell <b>can</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> accessed by automobile. As such, several groups are increasing efforts for protected status of the area, via National Park, National Monument or wilderness designation.|$|E

2500|$|Any {{new system}} of romanization, {{regardless}} of its merits, makes romanization choices harder rather than simpler. New spellings are introduced for and even compete with the different spellings (such as Wade–Giles) that already exist.

5|$|An outward {{shift of}} the PPF results from growth of the {{availability}} of inputs, such as physical capital or labour, or from technological progress in knowledge of how to transform inputs into outputs. Such a shift reflects, for instance, economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of both outputs <b>can</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing the output of either good. Conversely, the PPF will shift inward if the labor force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or a natural disaster decreases the stock of physical capital.|$|E

5|$|In the Case 1 diagram, B1 cells show {{canonical}} values, {{which are}} color-coded {{to show their}} row-wise distribution in B2 triplets. Colors reflect distribution but not location or values. For this case: the B2 top row triplet (r21) has 1 value from B1 middle triplet, the other colorings <b>can</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> deduced. E.g. the B2 bottom row triplet (r23) coloring is forced by r21: the other 2 B1 middle values must go to bottom, etc. Fill {{in the number of}} B2 options for each color, 3..1, beginning top left. The B3 color-coding is omitted since the B3 choices are row-wise determined by B1, B2. B3 always contributes 3! permutations per row triplet, or 63 for the block.|$|E
