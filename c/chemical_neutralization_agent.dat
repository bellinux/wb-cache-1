40|$|AbstractPorter {{has shown}} that excited neutrals of {{specified}} internal energies can be prepared by neutralization of an ion beam with metal vapors of low ionization potential (IP). For specific problems in neutralization-reionization mass spectrometry, a metal with the desired IP value may not be available, or it may present experimental problems such as a high vaporization temperature, instrument contamination, or detector instability. The use of organic <b>neutralization</b> <b>agents</b> such as tetra-p-anisylethylene (IP = 6. 0 eV) can minimize these problems (although cross sections for neutralization with these are a factor of 5 lower than those with metals), and can provide a much wider range of IP values.

The preparation conditions applied in the production step of nanocrystalline boehmite strongly affect its morphology, which in turn is reflected to the final transition alumina. In this work, a precipitation method {{for the production of}} nanocrystalline boehmite is described studying the effect of pH, temperature and ageing time on the morphology of the final precipitate. The experiments were performed at temperatures 30, 60 and 90 degrees C, under moderate pH conditions (5, 6, 7) and 1 week of ageing in the mother liquor. What are noteworthy in the performed experiments are the starting solution used and the mixing procedure. The starting solution was a supersaturated sodium aluminate solution (SSA) with concentration equal to the Bayer liquor, which is not usually used in such synthesis experiments. On the other hand, the mixing procedure did not follow the usual route of addition of the <b>neutralization</b> <b>agent</b> (acid) to the SSA solution; on the contrary the SSA solution was added to the <b>neutralization</b> <b>agent.</b> Amorphous boehmite was prepared at temperatures as low as 30 degrees C and pH 7 under prolonged ageing conditions. At 60 degrees C the formation of pure nanocrystalline boehmite with crystallites 3 - 8 nm, was facilitated at pH 6 and pH 7 after ageing in the mother liquor, while at the higher temperature of 90 'C the formation of pure nanocrystalline boehmite with crystallite size between 3 and 13 nm was achieved at pH 5, pH 6 and pH 7. Ageing and temperature influenced the crystallinity of the precipitated phases, with prolonged ageing and high temperatures inducing high crystallinity. The pH conditions also had a strong effect on the crystallite size of precipitates. Actually, for the same temperature and ageing time the higher the pH the larger the crystallites of the precipitates. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V All rights reserved...|$|R

The polyol was modified with hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and hydroxyl-terminated acryloni-trile–butadiene copolymer (HTBN). The effect of the HTPB and HTBN content on the adhesive strength was investi-gated. The effect of the prepolymer molecular weight was also investigated. Increases in the HTPB and HTBN contents led {{to an increase in}} the adhesive strength because of the increase of chemical affinity between the adhesive and the substrate.

From a waste minimization standpoint, the use of spent magnesia pyrochemical crucibles as the acid <b>neutralization</b> <b>agent</b> is attractive since this process would take a stream destined for transuranic waste {{and use it as}} a reagent in routine plutonium residue processing. Since Los Alamos National Laboratory has several years of experience using magnesium hydroxide as a neutralizing agent for waste acid from plutonium processing activities, the use of spent magnesia pyrochemical crucibles appeared to be an attractive extension of this activity. In order to be competitive with magnesium hydroxide, however, size reduction of crucible shards had to be performed effectively within the constraints of glovebox operations, and acid neutralization time using crucible shards had to be comparable to neutralization times observed when using reagent-grade magnesium hydroxide. The study utilized non-plutonium-contaminated crucibles for equipment evaluation and selection and used nonradioactive acid solutions for completing the neutralization experiments.
