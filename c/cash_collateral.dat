40|$|The Objective of this {{research}} is to analyse the influence of free <b>cash</b> flow, <b>collateral</b> assets, debt to equity ratio and profitability toward dividend policy in manufacture companies that is listed in BEI over period 2009 - 2011. Sampling technique used here is purposive sampling. The data is obtained based on Indonesian Capital Market Directory and audited financial reports. It is gained sample amount of 188 observations. The analysis technique used here is multiple regression with the least square difference and hypothesis test using tstatistic to examine partial regression coefficient and f-statistic to examine the mean of mutual effect with level of significance 1 percent. In addition, classical assumption is also performed including normality test, multicolinearity test, heteroscedasticity test and autocorrelation test.

Letters of credit are becoming less common forms of credit enhancement, as much of their appeal was lost when the rating agencies downgraded the long-term debt of several LOC-provider banks in the early 1990s. Because securities enhanced with LOCs from these lenders faced possible downgrades as well, issuers began to utilize <b>cash</b> <b>collateral</b> accounts instead of LOCs in cases where external credit support was needed.|$|E

The main point of contention was that the collateral is aimed to be a <b>cash</b> deposit, a <b>collateral</b> the Greeks can only give by recycling part of the funds loaned by Finland for the bailout, which means Finland and the other eurozone countries guarantee the Finnish loans {{in the event of a}} Greek default.|$|R
30|$|Repurchase {{agreements}} (repos) are secured {{money market}} transactions. The <b>cash</b> taker provides <b>collateral</b> {{in the form}} of securities and in return receives money from the cash provider. To ensure the continuous covering of the cash amount, the definition of eligible collateral, its handling and valuation play an important role. This is mainly because the collateral nearly eliminates credit risk. In Switzerland, Swiss franc repos are almost exclusively conducted via the highly standardized repo platform, with four different pre-defined collateral baskets. Each basket comprises different security categories, such as government bonds or covered bonds. This paper analyzes the interest rate setting on the repo market with data from June 1999 to June 2005. It evaluates if the securities provided as collateral influenced the repo rate or not. A price differentiation with respect to the collateral provided is found.|$|R
