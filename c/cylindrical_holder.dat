The radio-frequency coil features an eight-element microstrip line configuration that, in conjunction with a segmented outer copper shield, forms a transversal electromagnetic (TEM) resonator structure. Matching and active tuning/detuning is achieved through fixed/variable capacitors and a PIN diode for each resonator element. These components along with radio-frequency chokes (RFCs) and blocking capacitors are placed on two printed circuit boards (PCBs) whose copper coated ground planes form the front and back of the volume coil and are therefore {{an integral part of the}} resonator structure. The magnetic resonance signal response is received with a dome-shaped single-loop surface coil that can be height-adjustable with respect to the animal 2 ̆ 7 s head.

40|$|One {{limitation}} of electrospinning {{stems from the}} charge build-up that occurs during processing, preventing further fibre deposition and limiting the scaffold overall thickness and hence their end-use in tissue engineering applications targeting large tissue defect repair. To overcome this, we have developed a technique in which thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) and electrospinning are combined. Thick three-dimensional, multilayered composite scaffolds were produced by simply stacking individual polycaprolactone (PCL) microfibrous electrospun discs into a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>holder</b> that {{was filled with a}} 3 % poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) solution in dimethylsulfoxide (a good solvent for PLGA but a poor one for PCL). The construct was quenched in liquid nitrogen and the solvent removed by leaching out in cold water. This technique enables the fabrication of scaffolds composed principally of electrospun membranes that have no limit to their thickness. The mechanical properties of these scaffolds were assessed under both quasi-static and dynamic conditions. The multilayered composite scaffolds had similar compressive properties to 5 % PCL scaffolds fabricated solely by the TIPS methodology. However, tensile tests demonstrated that the multilayered construct outperformed a scaffold made purely by TIPS, highlighting the contribution of the electrospun component of the composite scaffold to enhancing the overall mechanical property slate. Cell studies revealed cell infiltration principally from the scaffold edges under static seeding conditions.

Prior to this investigation, the radiation chemical yield of the ferric ions (G-value) at the lr- 192 equivalent photon energy was established by interpolating between G-values obtained for Co- 60 and 250 kV x-rays. An irradiation geometry was developed with a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>holder</b> to contain the Fricke solution and allow irradiations in a water phantom to be conducted using a standard Nucletron microSelectron V 2 HDR Ir- 192 afterloader.

Initial investigations focused on reproducible positioning of the ring-shaped holder for the Fricke solution with respect to the Ir- 192 source and obtaining an acceptable type A uncertainty in the optical density measurements required to yield the absorbed dose. Source positioning was found to be reproducible to better than 0. 32 ̆ 009 mm, and a careful cleaning and control procedure reduced the variation in optical density reading due to contamination of the Fricke solution by the PMMA holder.

High-field, high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy at W- (∼ 95 GHz) and D-band (∼ 140 GHz) is important for investigating the conformational dynamics of flexible biological macromolecules because this frequency range has increased spectral sensitivity to nitroxide motion over the 100 ps to 2 ns regime. However, low concentration sensitivity remains a roadblock for studying aqueous samples at high magnetic fields. Here, we examine the sensitivity of a non-resonant thin-layer <b>cylindrical</b> sample <b>holder,</b> coupled to a quasi-optical induction-mode W-band EPR spectrometer (HiPER), for continuous wave (CW) EPR analyses of: (i) the aqueous nitroxide standard, TEMPO; (ii) the unstructured to α-helical transition of a model IDP protein; and (iii) the base-stacking transition in a kink-turn motif of a large 232 nt RNA.

40|$|Fat {{crystallization}} plays {{a critical}} role in determining the macroscopic properties of fat containing food products, such as chocolate, butter and margarine. However, most of the currently used techniques to monitor fat crystallization are off-line techniques, while on-line techniques could have considerable financial benefits by avoiding expensive rework or disposal of out-of-specification products. The aim of this PhD research was therefore to study the potential of an advanced ultrasonic shear wave reflection (USWR) technique based on low intensity ultrasound which has the potential to measure the crystallization behavior on-line. This reflection set-up was chosen to avoid problems with the high attenuation of fats and shear waves were used to obtain information about the microstructure of fats. The proposed technique was developed under both static (chapter 3) and dynamic (stirring) conditions (chapter 6) using cocoa butter as a substrate. The validation of both techniques (chapter 5 and 8) was conducted by varying process conditions and adding minor components to cocoa butter. Limonene and lecithin were chosen as minor components and their effects on the crystallization behavior of cocoa butter were also studied in depth by conventional techniques (chapter 4 and 7). In chapter 3, an USWR technique to monitor the isothermal crystallization process of cocoa butter under static conditions was developed. The custom-built experimental set-up basically consists of a <b>cylindrical</b> sample <b>holder,</b> which is open at both sides, with the bottom side connected to a thick plexiglass plate. A shear wave transducer is positioned {{at the bottom of the}} plexiglass plate. The remarkable oscillatory damped response in the shear wave reflection coefficient (swRC) as function of the crystallization time could be explained by constructive and destructive interference of a first reflection at the boundary between the plexiglass delay line and the crystallized cocoa butter and a second reflection occurring at the interface between crystallized and liquid substance. This hypothesis was supported by the excitation frequency dependence of the oscillations. An inverse model was developed based on the oscillatory damped response including four parameters: tind (induction time), K (crystallization rate constant), vs 2 (shear ultrasonic velocity) and as 2 (shear ultrasonic attenuation coefficient). Before this technique was validated, the effect of limonene on the crystallization behavior of cocoa butter was first studied with conventional techniques (chapter 4). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction measurements revealed that the effect of limonene on the crystallization kinetics was temperature dependent. This could be explained by a two-sided effect: the addition of limonene resulted in a reduction of the amount of unstable crystals and an acceleration of polymorphic transitions. At 17 °C, the crystallization process was accelerated due to the acceleration of the formation of more stable polymorphic forms, while there were insufficient a crystals for an a mediated b’ nucleation at 20 °C, resulting in a slower crystallization process. In chapter 5, both the temperature effect and the effect of limonene in different concentrations on the isothermal crystallization of cocoa butter were studied by way of the USWR technique and the associated inverse model. Subsequently, the USWR parameters were compared to results of conventional techniques to monitor fat crystallization (DSC, microscopy). The study showed that tind and K provide information on the kinetics of the microstructure development, as the results of the USWR technique were much more comparable to microscopy measurements providing information about the developed microstructure than to DSC experiments which are known to measure the primary crystallization. The parameter vs 2 is related with the equilibrium SFC (solid fat content), while as 2 is both influenced by the SFC and the organization of the crystals in the network, yielding information about the microstructure of the crystallized samples. In chapter 6, the monitoring technique was adapted for dynamic conditions by placing an overhead stirrer above the sample holder. Under dynamic conditions, the typical pattern of the swRC exhibited a monotonic decline instead of the oscillating pattern and also the frequency dependence disappeared. This drastic change could be explained by the fact that in this case a homogeneous sample was measured, without the formation of additional layering and surfaces, and hence without interferences. Therefore, the inverse model has also been adjusted to be able to fit this monotonic decline, resulting in two parameters: t 1 and Kini, indicating the start and initial rate constant of the microstructural development respectively. Only the first 30 minutes were modeled as a much faster stick release between the plexiglass and the sample was observed under dynamic conditions, making a further measurement impossible. In chapter 7, the effect of different lecithins on cocoa butter crystallization was studied with conventional techniques (DSC, rheology and a simple dynamic experiment). It was however very difficult to infer general conclusions as the effect of lecithin depended on the concentration and the matrix to which they were added. Furthermore, the observed effects depended on the measuring technique used to study the crystallization, whereby only the dynamic experiment could detect a difference between the different lecithins. Therefore in chapter 8, the effect of different lecithins was investigated with the more advanced dynamic USWR technique. To investigate the sensitivity of this technique, the stirring rate was first varied, and it was observed that a higher stirring rate resulted in a lower t 1 and higher Kini, which is consistent with a faster microstructural development. Furthermore, one sunflower lecithin demonstrated a lower t 1 and a much faster release between the plexiglass and the sample, suggesting that certain differences in microstructural development could be detected by the dynamic USWR technique, while no differences were observed by static DSC experiments measuring the primary crystallization. In conclusion, the proposed USWR technique shows definite promise to monitor the fat crystallization process. Its major advantages are the non-destructive character, the information about the microstructural development and the ability to measure under dynamic conditions. nrpages: 205 status: publishe...|$|R
