5|$|The Hattiesburg section {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with Interstate 59 (I-59) and US 98 in Hattiesburg, Lamar County, {{where the road}} continues west as part of US 98.

5|$|As the Market {{was being}} built, a {{cut and cover}} railway tunnel was {{constructed}} underground <b>City</b> <b>street</b> level to create a triangular junction with the railway between Blackfriars and Kings Cross through Snow Hill Tunnel — closed in 1916, it has been revived and is now used for Thameslink rail services. The construction of extensive railway sidings, beneath Smithfield Park, facilitated the transfer of animal carcases to its Cold Store, and directly up to the Meat Market via lifts. These sidings closed in the 1960s, and are now used as a car park, accessed via a cobbled descent at the centre of Smithfield Park. Today, much of the meat is delivered to market by road.|$|E
5|$|Earp's {{good friend}} William Hart {{produced}} {{and wrote the}} seven-reel epic Wild Bill Hickok released by Paramount in 1923. It was the first movie to depict Wyatt Earp and the only movie that included his character before he died in 1929. Hart played Wild Bill Hickok and Bert Lindley played Earp. The role of Earp's character in the movie was very small. He appears {{at the back of}} a crowd scene when Hickok meets some gentlemen on the <b>city</b> <b>street.</b> Bert Lindley is not listed on some descriptions of the movie and this portrayal of Earp is often overlooked. Alan Barra, author of Inventing Wyatt Earp: His Life and Many Legends, overlooked this movie in his biography. Earp served as a technical adviser on the film.|$|E
5|$|M-102 is an east–west state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that {{runs along the}} northern boundary of Detroit following 8Mile Road. The highway follows the Michigan Baseline, {{a part of the}} land survey of the state, and the roadway is also called Base Line Road in places. As a county road or <b>city</b> <b>street,</b> 8Mile Road extends both east and west of the M-102 designation, which leaves 8Mile on the eastern end to follow Vernier Road. The western terminus of M-102 is at the junction of 8Mile Road and M-5 (Grand River Avenue) and the opposite end is at Vernier Road and Interstate94 (I-94). The 8Mile Road name extends west to Pontiac Trail near South Lyon with a discontinuous segment located west of US Highway23 (US23). The eastern end of 8Mile Road is in Grosse Pointe Woods near I-94.|$|E

5|$|In Washtenaw County, US12 {{passes through}} Benton {{in a rural}} {{southern}} section of the county. At Saline, the highway enters the suburban edge of the Ann Arbor–Ypsilanti metro area. US12 follows Michigan Avenue northeasterly through Saline and across an interchange with US23 before intersecting I-94 in Pittsfield and Ypsilanti townships. US12 leaves Michigan Avenue to follow I-94 at that freeway's exit181; Michigan Avenue continues into downtown Ypsilanti as a <b>city</b> <b>street.</b> I-94/US12 skirts around {{the south side of}} the city and intersects the western end of Business US12 (Bus. US12) at Huron Street south of downtown. The freeway continues around {{the south side of the}} city and rounds the north end of Ford Lake.

With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the <b>city</b> <b>street,</b> holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E
