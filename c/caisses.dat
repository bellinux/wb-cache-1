2500|$|The Raiffeisen {{banks in}} Germany relied on parish-based bonds, as parishes were {{very small and}} people were in {{constant}} communication with {{each other through the}} central nexus of the local church.

2500|$|And while {{acknowledging}} their debt to Coady {{and to the}} study club approach, Acadians felt like outsiders in the New Brunswick Credit Union League. This {{led to the emergence}} of a parallel Acadian federation in New Brunswick in 1946. [...] Today, the credit union system in this officially bilingual province has over twice the market penetration of the system in Nova Scotia. Its performance is largely driven by the 200,000 member Mouvement des <b>caisses</b> populaires acadiennes.|$|E
2500|$|For example, by 1936 {{there were}} 200 study clubs {{operating}} in New Brunswick, and the legislature passed a credit union law that year. Wilfred Keohan, the New Brunswick Registrar of Credit Unions, wrote in 1939 that [...] "There {{can be no}} doubt but that the experience in Nova Scotia had a marked influence as credit union enthusiasm knows no frontiers. The crystallized demand came from such bodies as the New Brunswick Council of Labour, the Trades & Labour Council, the Farmer's and Dairyman's Association, fishermen's organizations and members of the clergy who saw in credit unions an economic regeneration of their flocks." [...] By 1939 ten thousand members were participating in 95 credit unions (including <b>caisses</b> populaires) in the province.|$|E

As Feideilmid is also the father of Fachtna Fáthach {{according}} to this particular scheme, Forgo is thus an uncle of Conchobar mac Nessa.

5000|$|George Henderson {{elaborated}} on {{the presumed}} origin of ancestor worship in animism: The {{second phase of}} this stage of thought Animism would be a cult of human ancestors, specially of tribal chiefs and clan-heroes: this is Manism or Ancestor Worship proper, culminating in hero worship....it is to {{be noted that the}} characteristics pertaining to a particular clan or tribal community, which mark ancestor worship, will have fallen very much to the background if they can be at all inferred among the Celts; the relations emphasised will be found pertaining to mythologic concepts and to the Nature-Myth. For, as modifications and transitions in behalf are constant, ancestor worship gets partly transcended. But in Manism the guardian spirit has its specific influence on the tribal consciousness. I recollect Aoibhell of Craig Liath, the guardian spirit of the Dal <b>Caiss,</b> mentioned in the narrative concerning Brian Boru in the Wars of the Gaedhel and the Gall; there is also Mag Molach or Hairy Hand, and Bodach An Duin of Rothiemurchus, as well as the more familiar belief in the Brownie which renders offices of help in some houses,—a feeble survival of early phases of cult.|$|R

2500|$|The {{cost of the}} {{reconstruction}} projects was also rising rapidly. [...] In December 1858 the Council of State ruled that a property owner whose land was expropriated could retain the land that was not specifically needed for the street, greatly increasing the cost of expropriation. [...] Property owners also became much more clever in claiming higher payments for their buildings, often by creating sham shops and businesses within their buildings. [...] The cost of expropriations jumped from 70 million francs for the first projects to about 230 million francs for the second wave of projects. [...] In 1858, the Cour des Comptes, which oversaw the finances of the Empire, ruled that the <b>Caisses</b> des Grands Travaux was operating illegally by making [...] "disguised loans" [...] to private companies. [...] The court ruled that such loans had {{to be approved by}} the parliament. [...] The parliament was asked to approve a loan of 250 millions francs in 1865, and another 260 million francs in 1869. [...] The members of the opposition were particularly outraged when in 1866 he took away part of the Luxembourg {{to make room for the}} new avenue between the Luxembourg Gardens and the Observatory, and destroyed the old garden nursery which lay between rue August Comte, rue d'Assas and the avenue de l'Observatoire. [...] When the Emperor and Empress attended a performance at the Odeon Theater, near the Luxembourg gardens, members of the audience shouted [...] "Dismiss Haussmann!" [...] and jeered the Emperor.
