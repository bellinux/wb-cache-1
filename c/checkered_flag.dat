5|$|After {{over an hour}} {{behind the}} safety car, the field was {{released}} to race one last time with only twelve minutes remaining. With no close contests between the competitors, the field continued to run at less than racing pace, {{in preparation for the}} finish. The No. 8 Peugeot of Sébastien Bourdais briefly went into the pits, before returning to the track. To ensure that the Peugeot finished the race, and did not break down before crossing the finishing line behind the winner, Bourdais stopped at the Ford Chicanes on the final lap. Once the No. 1 Audi had gone past to take the <b>checkered</b> <b>flag,</b> Bourdais restarted the Peugeot and finished as well. The No. 16 Pescarolo finished the race in third, the highest placed petrol car.|$|E
5|$|Further {{back in the}} field, Max Verstappen overtook Nasr and Button to {{move into}} twelfth place on laps 44 and 46 respectively. However, he was deemed to have forced Button wide and was handed a five-second penalty {{to be added to}} his {{finishing}} time. Lap 53 saw Romain Grosjean move into the final point scoring position of tenth by passing Carlos Sainz Jr. into turn eight. Just one lap later, he took ninth place from Daniil Kvyat. At the front, Hamilton proved unable to reach his teammate, who took the <b>checkered</b> <b>flag</b> for his sixth win of the season. Kimi Räikkönen completed the podium, followed by Vettel, Pérez and Ricciardo.|$|E
5|$|Vettel drew {{to within}} two-tenths {{of a second}} behind Alonso as the final lap started, and came across Sutil, Hülkenberg, Petrov and Massa; both drivers managed to get past Petrov, and Alonso {{maintained}} the first position heading into the final sector of the track. The yellow flag for Kovalainen's car meant that Vettel's final chance of an overtake, into the final corner, was denied, and Alonso took the <b>checkered</b> <b>flag</b> on lap61 to win the race, 0.293 seconds ahead of Vettel. Alonso secured the first, and, as of 2015, the only Grand Chelem (leading the entire race from pole position with fastest lap) of his career {{as well as the}} first since Schumacher achieved the feat at the 2004 Hungarian Grand Prix. Webber was third, 1.2 seconds ahead of Button in fourth. Rosberg, Barrichello and Kubica took the next three positions. Sutil held off Hülkenberg in the final sector of the track for eighth and ninth on the line with Massa in tenth. Petrov, Alguersuari, Schumacher and Buemi finished one lap behind Alonso, with di Grassi and Kovalainen (despite his retirement) the last of the classified finishers.|$|E

This was Harvick's first win for Stewart-Haas Racing, and snapped a tie with Jimmie Johnson for most all-time wins at Phoenix.|$|E
25|$|In {{auto and}} {{motorcycle}} racing, racing flags {{are used to}} communicate with drivers. Most famously, a <b>checkered</b> <b>flag</b> {{of black and white}} squares indicates the end of the race, and victory for the leader. A yellow flag is used to indicate caution requiring slow speed and a red flag requires racers to stop immediately. A black flag is used to indicate penalties.|$|E

25|$|Montoya {{ran in the}} Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona for Chip Ganassi in the No. 02 Chip Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates BMW Riley with NASCAR {{teammate}} Jamie McMurray and Indycar champions Scott Dixon and Dario Franchitti. Montoya {{reunited with}} his old engine manufacturer BMW when Montoya drove WilliamsF1 in 2001–2004. The team led for around four hours and completed 249 laps. However, the car was forced to retire after 8:29:58 due to an engine failure, robbing the team of a potential victory. The Ganassi No. 01 entry then took the lead before Action Express Racing ultimately took the <b>checkered</b> <b>flag.</b>|$|E
25|$|Earnhardt had the {{dominant}} {{car of the}} race, leading 115 out of 160 laps. On the last restart, he managed {{to make a move}} from sixth to first place in the span of two laps, with Waltrip holding off the field as Earnhardt took the <b>checkered</b> <b>flag.</b> He won the MBNA Cal Ripken Jr. 400 at Dover, which was the first Cup race following the September 11 attacks as the original scheduled race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway was postponed {{until the end of the}} season.

In an afternoon-long battle of the pit crews Rusty Wallace, Bodine's crew executed a four-tire change in 19.6 seconds during the 10th and final caution period to beat Wallace back onto the track on lap 364 and easily cruised to the <b>checker</b> <b>flag.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the 2015 Coke Zero 400 at Daytona on July 5, Dillon {{started on}} the outside of the front row after {{qualifying}} was rained out, and led the first eight laps. Coming to the <b>checkered</b> <b>flag,</b> Dillon was hit in the left front tire by the spinning car of Denny Hamlin, causing him to flip into the catchfence over two rows of cars. Dillon climbed out of the car unharmed, save for a bruised tailbone and a bruise on his forearm, but five fans were injured by flying debris. Dillon was credited with a seventh-place finish. Dillon ended 2015 with one top five and five top 10s, finishing 21st in points.|$|E
25|$|Montoya visited victory lane {{three times}} across three {{different}} racing series in 2007. He kicked off 2007 {{with a win}} in his first Rolex 24 at Daytona race in the Grand American Road Racing Association. Then, in just his seventh-career Nationwide Series race, Montoya took the <b>checkered</b> <b>flag</b> in Mexico City to earn his first win in a stock car. His abilities on the road course were evident to his competitors when he captured his first Sprint Cup victory after qualifying 32nd at Infineon Raceway. Montoya and his No. 42 crew went on to amass one win, three top-five and six top-10 finishes during the 2007 Sprint Cup season. Montoya also earned the honor of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 2007 Rookie of the Year and finished 20th in series points.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{only two}} non-Cup Series regulars won a race during the 35-race schedule: David Gilliland and Paul Menard. Menard and Johnny Sauter {{were the only}} Busch Series regulars to finish in the top-10 in points that season. In 2007, only three Busch drivers scored a victory: Aric Almirola, Stephen Leicht and Jason Leffler. Almirola's victory at the Milwaukee Mile on June 23 was {{controversial}} and unusual, as Almirola was pulled from his pole-winning car after leading 42 of the first 58 laps {{to make room for}} Cup regular Denny Hamlin, due to obligations with sponsor Rockwell Automation which is headquartered in Milwaukee. Hamlin was scheduled to compete in a Cup event at Infineon Raceway the same weekend, and had several delays in his trek from California to Wisconsin. Despite the loss in track position due to the driver change, Hamlin got back to the front to take the <b>checkered</b> <b>flag</b> after 250 laps. Almirola was officially credited with the win because he made the start, but did not participate in victory celebrations.|$|E
50|$|Osborne and Edwards {{picked up}} in 2005 where they left off in 2004, {{breaking}} into the win column in just the fourth race {{of the year in}} Atlanta. The team would go on to post three more wins, taking <b>checkered</b> <b>flags</b> at Pocono, repeating at Atlanta and winning the inaugural night race at Texas Motor Speedway, while earning two poles and running to 13 top-five and 18 top 10 finishes. The duo also gave the competition a run for their money in the Chase finishing third in the 2005 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series points standings.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} formats {{were used}} for the race. In one format, the teams used vehicles to run the course, with one teammate pushing/pulling and the other riding, and they traded roles in addition to lanes for the second lap. The other format was a relay race on foot, with each teammate running one lap. Small challenges were usually set up around the track that each team had to complete during the run, such as gathering and carrying items, running through tires, or squirting targets with a seltzer bottle. Roth signaled the start and finish of the race with the green and <b>checkered</b> <b>flags</b> used in motor racing.|$|R
50|$|The second race {{started with}} the same grid as the first race, which allowed Jonny Cocker to once again lead the opening laps in Drayson Lola. Stefan Mücke in the Aston Martin was able to catch Cocker and take the lead several laps in, which it {{maintained}} {{for the rest of}} the event and took the second of the weekend's <b>checkered</b> <b>flags.</b> Race one winners Sora Racing finished in second but over a minute behind the Aston Martin. Oreca once again finished on the podium with third. In LMP2, early damage to the Ibañez Courage allowed OAK Racing to win the second race unchallenged.|$|R
25|$|On June 12, 2005, Edwards {{picked up}} his second Nextel Cup win by taking the <b>checkered</b> <b>flag</b> at the Pocono 500 at the Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pennsylvania. The weekend was {{somewhat}} bittersweet for Edwards, as the Busch Series race at the Nashville Superspeedway in Lebanon, Tennessee had been rained out the night before, and rescheduled for the same day. Also, qualifying for that race had been rained out, and in NASCAR, when qualifying is rained out, the starting grid is set by owner points. Through this process, Edwards was awarded pole, but Hank Parker, Jr. ended up driving the car to a 20th-place finish. Since Edwards did not start the race he was not awarded any points, and as such lost a 74-point lead in Busch Series points and dropped to fourth in the standings; Edwards never recovered from the missed race and finished the season third in points, well behind series champion Martin Truex, Jr.. Edwards got his third win of 2005 on October 30 in the Bass Pro Shops MBNA 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, sweeping both of the Nextel Cup races at Atlanta for the 2005 season.|$|E
25|$|Race {{officials}} {{threw the}} <b>checkered</b> <b>flag</b> after the crash. Waltrip won the race, with Earnhardt, Jr. finishing second behind him. Rusty Wallace finished third, Ricky Rudd finished fourth, polesitter Bill Elliott finished fifth, Wallace's brother Mike finished sixth, Marlin finished seventh, Bobby Hamilton finished eighth, Jeremy Mayfield finished ninth, and outside polesitter Stacy Compton finished 10th. Joe Nemechek finished 11th. Earnhardt and Schrader were credited finishing 12th and 13th despite not completing the final lap (only 11 cars – Waltrip and Earnhardt Jr. included – finished on the lead lap {{as a result}} of the long green flag runs and the lap 173 crash). Afterwards, Earnhardt, Jr. rushed to his father's location. Earnhardt was extricated from his car by Daytona's safety teams and was taken to the Halifax Medical Center. Attempts to revive Earnhardt failed and his death was officially pronounced at 5:16p.m. EST (22:16 UTC); he was 49 years old. The official cause of Earnhardt's death was given by the Volusia County medical examiner's office as blunt force trauma to his head among other injuries due to the incident. He also sustained a fatal basilar skull fracture on impact.|$|E
500|$|Ragan, who was {{the leader}} before the fifteenth caution, {{described}} his frustration after being black flagged by saying, [...] "It was tough to swallow.

We were sitting in position and just didn't do it. This thing only comes around once a year, so I'll think about it until we throw the <b>checkered</b> <b>flag</b> on next year's Daytona 500. So it's tough, but there is a bright side– we finished, we got some points and we ran up front, but we just didn't get what we come down here to do." ...|$|E

500|$|Richmond {{fell ill}} {{the day after}} the 1986 NASCAR annual banquet during a promotional trip to New York City. He was not well enough to begin the 1987 NASCAR season despite lengthy {{hospitalization}} in Cleveland and further rest at home; when Richmond missed the Daytona 500, his condition was reported as double pneumonia. Media later reported that he had tested positive for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). He returned to Pocono for the Miller High Life 500 {{during the middle of the}} year. Starting third, he led by the fifth lap and ultimately led 82 laps, including the final 46, to win the race by eight car-lengths over Bill Elliott. In the middle of the race, Richmond's car suffered gearbox problems. Because he could use only fourth (high) gear, he had to use that gear to slowly exit the pits. Richmond was emotional after the victory, saying, [...] "I had tears in my eyes when I took the <b>checkered</b> <b>flag.</b> Then every time anyone congratulated me, I started bawling again." [...] Richmond earned a victory in the next race at Riverside, and made his final 1987 start at Michigan International Speedway's Champion Spark Plug 400 that August, finishing 29th with a blown engine. He resigned from Hendrick Motorsports in September 1987.|$|E
500|$|Button drew {{alongside}} teammate Hamilton on lap 48 {{heading into}} turn twelve and passed Hamilton (who drove {{on the inside}} line) around {{the outside of the}} corner. Hamilton reclaimed the lead on the following lap after getting a run on the pit straight and narrowly avoided a collision with Button at turn one. [...] Hamilton began to pull away from teammate Button. Sutil passed Kobayashi around the outside for tenth on lap 52 while Button was ordered to conserve his tyres and fuel on the same lap. Chandhok became the final retirement of the race when he drove into the pit lane with a fuel pump failure on lap 53. Alonso attempted to overtake Petrov around the outside of turn one on lap 54 but was unable to get ahead. Alonso tried again going into turn three and Petrov (who had worn tyres) made an error allowing Alonso to move into eighth. Both drivers made contact and Petrov sustained a punctured tyre. Petrov made a pit stop for soft tyres on lap 56 and emerged in 15th. Hamilton maintained his lead throughout the remainder of the race and took the <b>checkered</b> <b>flag</b> on lap 58 to secure his first win of the season, 2.6 seconds in front of teammate Button. Webber was third, ahead of Schumacher who equalled his best result of the season, having finished fourth at the Spanish Grand Prix as well. Rosberg held off Kubica to take fifth, followed by Massa, Alonso, Sutil and Kobayashi. De la Rosa was close behind teammate Kobayashi in eleventh. Alguersuari and Liuzzi took the next two positions. Barrichello, Petrov, Buemi, Hülkenberg, Glock, di Grassi and Chandhok (despite his mechanical issues) were the last of the classified finishers. Hamilton's victory made him the fifth different driver in seven races to win a Grand Prix in 2010.|$|E
500|$|Richmond joined Hendrick Motorsports in 1986, {{where he}} {{teamed up with}} veteran crew chief Harry Hyde. It took the team {{until the middle of}} the season to gel. Richmond had {{suffered}} a 64-race winless streak that was finally broken at the Van Scoy Diamond Mine 500 at Pocono in June 1986. After two straight second-place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside, Richmond started the Pocono event in third place inside the second row. That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point. NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track. It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps, and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their windshields. Two hours later, the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third. After Richmond's car was adjusted to remove the [...] "push", the car was more to his liking. Because his radio did not work, he was unable to communicate with his crew chief, Hyde, and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left. Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel {{to make it to the}} end. After Richmond took the lead with 30 laps left in the race, [...] Dale Earnhardt made up three seconds on Richmond's five-second lead. With four laps to go, Buddy Arrington spun in a three-car accident. The remaining laps of the race where completed slowly under caution and Richmond took the <b>checkered</b> <b>flag</b> for the victory. He had led 97 laps, including the final 30, taking his first victory in a Rick Hendrick car.|$|E
50|$|After {{struggling}} to find primary sponsorship for 2006, Braun merged with Akins Motorsports (then a Dodge team) and hired Jason Leffler as the full-time driver, running as Braun-Akins Racing. After the release of Akins' driver A.J. Foyt IV, Leffler moved in the No. 38 and the No. 32 became a part-time team, running with driver Dave Blaney. Blaney had a few good runs and then pulled off a big victory in the fall event at Lowe's Motor Speedway. Racing {{side by side with}} Matt Kenseth during the final laps, going into turn 4, Kenseth lost control of his car and spun out, Blaney raced on to the <b>checker</b> <b>flag</b> for the win.|$|R
