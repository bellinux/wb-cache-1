5000|$|<b>Consideration</b> <b>is</b> {{the concept}} of value offered and {{accepted}} by people or organisations entering into contracts. Anything of value promised by one party to the other when making a contract can be treated as [...] "consideration": for example, if A signs a contract {{to buy a car}} from B for $5,000, A's <b>consideration</b> <b>is</b> the $5,000, and B's <b>consideration</b> <b>is</b> the car.|$|R

50|$|Generally, past <b>{{consideration}}</b> <b>is</b> not a {{valid consideration}} {{and has no}} legal value. Past <b>consideration</b> <b>is</b> <b>consideration</b> that has already flowed from the promisee to the promisor. That is, the promisee's act or forbearance predates the promisor's promise.

25|$|Different {{people may}} have {{different}} choice sets, depending on their circumstances.

25|$|The above <b>considerations</b> <b>are</b> {{important}} because, in many {{global warming}} simulations, high latitude temperatures increase much {{more at the}} poles through an ice-albedo feedback.

25|$|The (short term) {{goals of}} working capital are {{therefore}} not approached {{on the same}} basis as (long term) profitability, and working capital management applies different criteria in allocating resources: the main <b>considerations</b> <b>are</b> (1) cash flow / liquidity and (2) profitability / return on capital (of which cash flow {{is probably the most}} important).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Consideration</b> may <b>be</b> past, {{present or}} future. Past <b>consideration</b> <b>is</b> not <b>consideration</b> {{according}} to English law. However it <b>is</b> a <b>consideration</b> as per Indian law. Example of past <b>consideration</b> <b>is,</b> [...] "A" [...] renders some service to [...] "B" [...] at latter's desire. After a month [...] "B" [...] promises to compensate [...] "A" [...] for service rendered to him earlier. When <b>consideration</b> <b>is</b> given simultaneously with promise, {{it is said}} to <b>be</b> present <b>consideration</b> [...]. For example, [...] "A" [...] receives Rs.50/- in return for which he promises to deliver certain goods to [...] "B". The money [...] "A" [...] receives <b>is</b> the present <b>consideration.</b> When consideration to one party to other is to pass subsequently to the maker of the contract, is said to <b>be</b> future <b>consideration.</b> For example. [...] "A" [...] promises to deliver certain goods to [...] "B" [...] after a week. [...] "B" [...] promises to pay the price after a fortnight, such <b>consideration</b> <b>is</b> future.|$|R

Another consideration is size and effort of each mission.|$|E
25|$|Small scale {{capitalism}}, which means, capitalism {{for small}} and medium-sized business instead of corporate socialisms; decentralization; Negative income tax and Trust regulation; are the examples of technoloberalism in economics aspects.

25|$|The {{equation}} for an oblong {{object is}} identical {{to that of a}} sphere, with the object being approximated as an ellipsoid and the axis of length being chosen as the characteristic length scale. Such <b>considerations</b> <b>are</b> important in natural streams, for example, where there are few perfectly spherical grains. For grains in which measurement of each axis is impractical, sieve diameters are used instead as the characteristic particle length-scale. Both approximations alter the values of the critical Reynolds number.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Consideration</b> <b>is</b> {{executory}} when {{a promise}} {{to do something in}} the future is given in exchange for another promise {{to be done in the}} future. <b>Consideration</b> <b>is</b> executed when a promise is actually executed, in exchange for another promise to be executed in the future. <b>Consideration</b> <b>is</b> past when a promise has been given or executed before and independently of the other promise. For example, I promised to take you to lunch, and then when we got there I said [...] "you must pay, because I have given you the benefit of my company".
