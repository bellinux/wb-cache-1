2500|$|The Sicilian Mafia, {{also known}} as simply the Mafia, is a {{criminal}} syndicate in Sicily, Italy. It is a loose association of criminal groups that share a <b>common</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> and code of conduct. [...] The basic group {{is known as a}} [...] "family", [...] "clan", or [...] "cosca". Each family claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town or village or a neighbourhood (borgata) of a larger city, in which it operates its rackets. Its members call themselves [...] "men of honour", although the public often refers to them as [...] "mafiosi". The mafia's core activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions.|$|E

30|$|The {{empirical}} data {{is based on}} a case study of a single procurement process in a Swedish county. The choice of case was strategic and based on several criteria. The first criterion was made according to achieve representation, i.e. it was important to chose an procurement that was made in a context that could be seen as representative for the institutional features of the Scandinavian model in Sweden. The procurement should therefore have to have occurred in a county where the public transport authority is 50 % county council owned and 50 % municipally owned. The county should also have a regional cooperation body. This was important though joint ownership and an additional regional cooperation body is the most <b>common</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> in this context in Sweden. Based on this first criteria, other criterion were then used to narrow down the selection, for example, due to the tendency criterion, it was important to choose an procurement that was recently conducted [24].|$|E
30|$|There was {{consensus}} that more subspecialisation training is needed, and that subspecialisation {{is a clear}} need for radiologists in large academic and community hospitals, {{and in most cases}} subspecialty sections should remain within the overarching department of radiology, with the benefit of shared facilities, efficient use of resources and <b>common</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>structures.</b> It seems that many radiologists support the concept of multispecialty radiology and agree that the general radiologist is ideally a multispecialty radiologist.

Both, the distribution of water and sanitation, fall within the competences of the cantons, which normally delegate this mandate down to the municipalities. The water sector in Switzerland is organised as a local monopoly, with the most <b>common</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> being the municipal water service for drinking water supply, and the (non-autonomous) municipal management for sanitation services. Although significant changes are not expected in the sector in the near future, there are important features and dynamics that may help understanding how the sector will most likely evolve. Firstly, and especially in what concerns water supply operators, {{there has been a}} trend towards the autonomisation and professionalisation of the public entities.

40|$|It {{is clear}} that there is a growing number of {{individuals}} who are attracted to working smarter together rather than harder alone because of a shared conviction that problems in schools are solved more effectively through collaboration. Among educational reformers and policy makers, there is an increased understanding that problems in education cannot easily be divided into pieces and addressed in isolation from each other. There may in fact be problems that are too large for any one school to solve on its own. Further to this, a belief in the power of joint problemsolving is the common feature of many different kinds of network. Educators are increasingly reaching beyond their school and district boundaries and seeking support through networks. Networks appear to be everywhere on the USA educational landscape as well as around the globe. Some networks are organised around a common goal, whereas others unite schools with a <b>common</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>structure,</b> such as small schools, charter schools or alternative schools. There are networks for teachers, principals, schools and even districts which share commo...|$|E

40|$|The {{removal of}} {{invasive}} mammals from islands {{has become a}} powerful tool for restoring ecosystems and preventing extinctions. As larger and more complex islands are being targeted for restoration, eradication campaigns will become even more complex and multidimensional – biologically, operationally, and fi nancially. Eradication projects are typically conducted by governmental conservation agencies (GCAs), non-governmental organisations (NGOs), or for- profi t enterprises (FPEs). Partnerships across these three organisational types are increasingly <b>common.</b> The <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> of the institutions involved in eradication and other restoration campaigns undoubtedly plays a role in the effectiveness and nature of outcomes. We briefl y explore the advantages and challenges of different <b>organisational</b> <b>structures</b> conducting invasive mammal eradication programmes. We do so to explore potential synergies that arise from strategic partnerships between different types of organisations. GCAs commonly enjoy special privileges, reliable operational budgets, and simplifi ed lines of communications – all of which are advantages to managing an eradication project. However, they often face challenges, including lack of experience, vulnerability to outside pressures, and a risk averse atmosphere. NGOs often have relative advantages in fundraising capacity and fl exibility. Their challenges include permitting, fundraising pressure, and less accountability. FPEs commonly enjoy less regulation and bureaucracy, have more operational fl exibility and excellence, and incentives for innovation. Limited project control, near-sighted investment, and risk avoidance can present them with challenges during eradication projects. Recent partnerships that executed watershed eradication campaigns over the last decade suggest that working together on island restoration programmes can leverage synergies. Partnering across <b>organisational</b> <b>structures</b> {{is likely to be a}} highly effective strategy for mainstreaming invasive species eradications...|$|R
40|$|Background Clinical trial success {{depends on}} {{appropriate}} management, but practical guidance to trial organisation and planning is lacking. The Incident Command System (ICS) is the ‘gold standard’ management system developed for managing diverse operations in major incident {{and public health}} arenas. It enables effective and flexible management through integration of personnel, procedures, resources, and communications within a <b>common</b> hierarchical <b>organisational</b> <b>structure.</b> Conventional ICS organisation consists of five function modules: Command, Planning, Operations, Logistics, and Finance/Administration. Large clinical trials will require a separate Regulatory Administrative arm, and an Information arm, consisting of dedicated data management and information technology staff. We applied ICS principles to organisation {{and management of the}} Prehospital Use of Plasma in Traumatic Haemorrhage (PUPTH) trial. This trial was a multidepartmental, multiagency, randomised clinical trial investigating prehospital administration of thawed plasma on mortality and coagulation response in severely injured trauma patients. We describe the ICS system as it would apply to large clinical trials in general, and the benefits, barriers, and lessons learned in utilising ICS principles to reorganise and coordinate the PUPTH trial. Results Without a formal trial management structure, early stages of the trial were characterised by inertia and organisational confusion. Implementing ICS improved organisation, coordination, and communication between multiple agencies and service groups, and greatly streamlined regulatory compliance administration. However, unfamiliarity of clinicians with ICS culture, conflicting resource allocation priorities, and communication bottlenecks were significant barriers. Conclusions ICS is a flexible and powerful organisational tool for managing large complex clinical trials. However, for successful implementation the cultural, psychological, and social environment of trial participants must be accounted for, and personnel need to be educated in the basics of ICS...|$|R
40|$|<b>Organisational</b> <b>structure</b> {{has been}} {{assessed}} with various different scales resulting in inconsistencies in {{the measures of}} this construct. Hence, a re-conceptualisation of the <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> construct is crucial {{due to the fact}} that researchers have thus far provided inconclusive agreement on what dimensions should be included in measuring <b>organisational</b> <b>structure,</b> although many studies have conceptualized <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> as a multidimensional construct. This study attempted to examine the psychometric properties of the <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> construct by integrating four subscales – decision making, hierarchy of authority, job codification, and rule observation. A priori proposition was made that <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> measurement could be explained by four of the hypothesised dimensions. SPSS version 12 and AMOS 4 were used to analyse the data. Findings supported the hypothesis that <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> can be measured by the four aforementioned subscales.

40|$|Flexible <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> is characterised by the {{creation}} of temporary teams within a basic departmental structure to solve a particular difficult task, important for the organisation and limited by time. It can be stated on its grounds that team work {{is the basis of}} innovative organisation operation. However, fact that organisations most often use individuals and not {{the creation}} of a team specialised in the given issue in solving of new, important and demanding projects and tasks sounds negative. If organisations want to create so called innovative environment, it is necessary to focus on <b>organisational</b> <b>structure,</b> while it is necessary to realise that different <b>organisational</b> <b>structures</b> are appropriate for different types of organisations. Presumption which was the basis of our analysis of <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> flexibility was the fact that organisational flexibility results from its ability to respond to changing conditions and new situations. Therefore, we monitored the frequency of characteristics like adaptation of <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> to changing conditions and delegation of operational decisions to line managers. However, the research implied that only a smaller part of <b>organisational</b> <b>structures</b> of the analysed organisations fulfils this characteristics. Stanisław Borkowsk...|$|R

This article explores how 62 Swedish housing companies, municipal and private, organise their open space maintenance {{and the reasons}} behind <b>organisational</b> <b>structure.</b> Here, <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> covers three aspects of open space maintenance: (1) whether performed in-house or by a contractor, (2) whether performed by local managers or circulating teams, and (3) whether and how residents are involved in management. The <b>organisational</b> <b>structures</b> varied widely among the housing companies studied. Mixed structures were common. Formal resident involvement processes were almost only found in municipally owned areas with local managers. The arguments could be derived from two general management approaches, prioritising either customer relations more or economic effi ciency.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} role leadership style and <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> play in <b>organisational</b> effectiveness. Organisational effectiveness {{is one of}} the more complex terms to define although essential to understand in order for an organisation to grow and develop. A small to medium wine sales and distribution organisation, its leadership style and <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> were chosen as a focus of this case study. Organisational effectiveness in this study is understood by the terms growth and development using the Greiner Theory of Evolution and Revolution (1983). The literature explores the role of leadership style in organisational effectiveness by exploring various theories and focusing on The Full Range Leadership Model by Bass and Avolio (1994). In order to analyse the role of <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> in <b>organisational</b> effectiveness, the different forms of <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> and the role they have on the organisation’s ability to grow and develop are explored. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the role leadership style and <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> play in <b>organisational</b> effectiveness. A qualitative content analysis paradigm was used with a Case Study method. The data was gathered using structured interviews conducted on all 39 permanent staff members, day to day observation and the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ). The MLQ is used as a supporting tool to verify the leadership findings in the interviews. The data was analysed using NVivo 10 and STATISTICA to gain insight into the leadership style and <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> of the organisation. The findings reflected that certain themes were repeatedly mentioned in the interviews and the definition of <b>organisational</b> effectiveness: <b>structured</b> leadership, more active leadership, lack of communication, staff motivation, staff training and development and organisational culture. As regards <b>organisational</b> <b>structure,</b> the following themes arose: The need for regular meetings, increased team work and more structured job descriptions. Through the analysis of all the components, leadership style and <b>organisational</b> <b>structure</b> were identified as having a significant role in organisational effectiveness which will be further analysed in this study...|$|R
