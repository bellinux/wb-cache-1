50|$|The W501G was touted to {{be a new}} machine, with an {{advanced}} 17 stage compressor design achieving a 19:1 pressure ratio (vs. 15:1 for the W501F). The combustion section featured DLN combustors with <25ppm NOx on gas (advertised from the start) and, notably, steam-cooled transition ducts. This novel design substantially reduced the amount of cooling air needed in the hot section of the engine, and eliminated the dilution effect of transition <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> the combustion zone.|$|E
50|$|A further {{bulkhead}} {{separated the}} fighting compartment {{from the engine}} and transmission bay. The engine compartment drew <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> through {{the top of each}} side and the roof and exhausted it to the rear. To allow fording through up to 4 ft deep water, a flap could be moved to cover the lowermost air outlet. Air for the engine could be drawn from the fighting compartment or the exterior; it was then passed through oil bath cleaners. It was modified so that the exhaust fumes were redirected so that they were not drawn into the fighting compartment, a problem found when tanks were drawn up together, preparing to advance.|$|E
50|$|A {{condenser}} unit used in central {{air conditioning systems}} typically has a heat exchanger section to cool down and condense incoming refrigerant vapor into liquid, a compressor to raise {{the pressure of the}} refrigerant and move it along, and a fan for blowing outside air through the heat exchanger section to cool the refrigerant inside. A typical configuration of such a {{condenser unit}} is as follows: The heat exchanger section wraps around the sides of the unit with the compressor inside. In this heat exchanger section, the refrigerant goes through multiple tube passes, which are surrounded by heat transfer fins through which cooling air can move from outside to inside the unit. There is a motorized fan inside the condenser unit near the top, which is covered by some grating to keep any objects from accidentally falling inside on the fan. The fan is used to blow the outside <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> through the heat exchange section at the sides and out the top through the grating. These condenser units are located {{on the outside of the}} building they are trying to cool, with tubing between the unit and building, one for vapor refrigerant entering and another for liquid refrigerant leaving the unit. Of course, an electric power supply is needed for the compressor and fan inside the unit.|$|E

40|$|The Advanced Turbine Systems (ATS) {{program was}} created by the U. S. Department of Energy to develop ultra-high efficiency, {{environmentally}} superior, and cost competitive gas turbine systems for generating electricity. Intercooling or cooling of air between compressor stages is a feature under consideration in advanced cycles for the ATS. Intercooling entails cooling of air between the low pressure (LP) and high pressure (HP) compressor sections of the gas turbine. Lower air temperature entering the HP compressor decreases the air volume flow rate and hence, the compression work. Intercooling also lowers temperature at the HP discharge, thus allowing for more effective use of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> the hot gas flow path...|$|E
40|$|With the aim {{of energy}} saving in cold storage in Italy, an {{integrated}} system (Total Energy System - TES) was considered for production of cold air, obtained by assembling compression system, absorption system and cogeneration unit (CHP) fuelled with methane-gas, in two different plant solutions: 1) TES consisting of the CHP, mechanically coupled with the compression refrigerating machine and thermically with the absorption system both designed to cool {{the air in the}} store rooms; 2) TES* characterized by the CHP, mechanically coupled with the compression refrigerating machine, designed to cool the air in the store rooms, and thermically with the absorption system designed to cool the air in a pre-refrigeration plant. A mathematical modeling and a consequent computer simulation of the behavior of both integrated system (TES and TES*) and both related conventional systems (CES consisting of a compression machine to cool the air in the store rooms and CES* characterized by two compression machines, the first <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> the store rooms, the second <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> a pre-refrigeration plant) was carried out. As an overall results, an energy saving of 21 ÷ 16 % was calculated. Considering the difficulty of comparing the different types of energy involved, an exergetic analysis was also carried-out, confirming a better exergetic efficiency of TES vs. CES. Finally, an economic evaluation was also conducted with a very attractive profitability index for TES and TES* systems fuelled with natural gas. The economic analysis showed that the use of bio-methane, in the TES system, is profitable up to a bio-methane cost of 0. 46 €/m 3...|$|E
50|$|An autovent is {{a device}} for {{maintaining}} a greenhouse or conservatory within {{a range of}} temperatures.

40|$|Two cowling systems {{intended}} {{to reduce the}} drag and improve the low-speed cooling characteristics of conventional radial engine cowlings were tested in model form to determine the practicability of the methods. One cowling included a blower mounted on the rear face of a large propeller spinner which drew <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> through side entrance ducts located behind the equivalent engine orifice plate. The air was passed through the equivalent engine orifice plate from rear to front and out through a slot between the spinner and the engine plate. The blower produced substantially all the power necessary to circulate the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> some cases, so the quantity of air flowing was independent of the air speed, Two types of blowers were used, a centrifugal type and one using airfoil blades which forced the air outward {{from the center of}} rotation. The other cowling was similar to the conventional N. A. C. A. cowling except for the addition of a large propeller spinner nose. The spinner was provided with a hole in the nose to admit cooling air and blower blades to increase the pressure for cooling at low speeds. The tests show that with both cowling types the basic drag of the nacelle was reduced substantially below that for the N. A. C. A. cowling by virtue of the better nose shape made possible by the spinner. The drag due to the side-entrance ducts was nearly zero when the openings were closed or when the blower was drawing in a certain quantity of air in proportion to the air speed. The drag increased, however, when air mas allowed to spill from the openings. The nose-entrance blower showed considerable promise as a cooling means although the blower tested was relatively inefficient, owing {{to the fact that the}} blower compartments evidently were expanded too rapidly under the conditions imposed. by the design...|$|E
40|$|This paper makes {{comparisons}} between CFD computations and experimental measurements of heat transfer for the axial throughflow of <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> a high-pressure compressor spool rig and a plane cavity rig. The heat transfer measurements are produced using fluxmeters {{and by the}} conduction solution method from surface temperature measurements. Numerical predictions are made by solving the Navier-Stokes equations in a full three-dimensional, time-dependent form using the finite-volume method. Convergence is accelerated using a multigrid algorithm and turbulence modeled using a simple mixing length formulation. Notwithstanding systematic differences between the measurements and the computations, the level of agreement {{can be regarded as}} promising in view of the acknowledged uncertainties in the experimental data, the limitations of the turbulence model and, perhaps more importantly, the modest grid densities used for the computations...|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} analysis {{has been made}} to show the method of obtaining the dimensions of the intercooler that will use the least total power for a given set of design conditions. The results of this analysis have been used in a sample calculation and, {{on the basis of this}} calculation, a new inter cooler arrangement is suggested. Because the length of the two air passages of the new arrangement is short in comparison with the third dimension, the height of the intercooler, this intercooler arrangement has unusual dimensions. These dimensions give the proposed intercooler arrangement an advantage over one of usual dimensions because less total power will be consumed by the intercooler, the weight and volume of the intercooler will be smaller, and the pressure drop of both the engine air and the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> passing through the intercooler will be lower...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{has been made}} of the drag losses in airplane flight of cross-flow plate and tubular intercoolers to determine the cooling-air weight flow and pressure drop that give a minimum drag loss for any given cooling effectiveness and, thus, a maximum power-plant net gain due to charge-air cooling. The drag losses considered in this analysis are those due to (1) the extra drag imposed on the airplane by the weight of the intercooler, its duct, and its supports and (2) the drag sustained by the <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> flowing through the intercooler and its duct. The investigation covers a range of conditions of altitude, airspeed, lift-drag ratio, supercharger-pressure ratio, and supercharger adiabatic efficiency.

40|$|Isothermal {{experiments}} on {{the mixing of}} jet rows in crossflow with {{particular attention to the}} quench zone mixing of RQL combustors have been carried out. Comparing mixing with combusting and isothermal mixing, it could be demonstrated, that with the combination of jet air concentration measurements and numerical calculations of the flow, medium pressure combustion tests with 3 -D probe measurements can be bypassed for the jet row optimization. The study with homogenuous crossflow for RQL combustors without <b>cooling</b> <b>air</b> <b>in</b> the primary zone showed optimum mixing with two staggered rows with close axial spacing. The light sheet technique could be demonostrated to give good quantitative results with higher spatial resolution than any other competing technique if applied with the appropriate care.

5000|$|Some food, such as butter, eggs, milk, {{and such}} {{need to be}} kept cool. Before modern {{refrigeration}} was available, iceboxes were popular. However, the problem with an icebox was that the cabinet housing it was large, but the actual refrigerated space was quite small, so a clever and innovative solution was invented, the [...] "cold pantry", sometimes called a [...] "California cooler". [...] The cold pantry usually consisted of a cabinet or cupboard with wooden-slat shelves (to allow for air circulation). An opening near the top vented to the outside, either through the roof or high out the wall. A second opening near the bottom vented also to the outside, but low near the ground and usually {{on the north side}} of the house where the <b>air</b> was <b>cooler.</b> As the <b>air</b> <b>in</b> the pantry warmed, it rose, escaping through the upper vent.

Operation of the stack under various scenarios was simulated such as start-up from room temperature, steady state at full and half load and sudden changes of load (from full to half load and reverse), under constant or variable flow rate of the <b>cooling</b> <b>air.</b> <b>In</b> variable power load operation, the stack temperature is not constant. One interesting finding of this analysis is that liquid water occurs at the outlet whenever the stack temperature falls below 60 °C, although the nominal operating conditions were selected such {{that there is no}} liquid water at the outlet at steady state operation. The results also indicate that this particular stack has insufficient heat exchange area with cooling air resulting in relatively large cooling air flow rates and low temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Cooling {{tower is}} an {{integrated}} {{part of any}} geothermal power plant because waste heat from turbine exhaust steam must be continuously rejected to make the plants operate.

In the present research, two novel dynamic thermal models have been introduced for the cast-resin dry-type transformer. These models are based on two artificial neural networks: the Elman recurrent networks (ELRN) and the nonlinear autoregressive model process with exogenous input (NARX). Using the experimental data, the introduced neural network thermal models have been trained.
