500|$|McClure's most {{prominent}} role {{occurs in the}} seventh-season episode [...] "A Fish Called Selma". In the episode, McClure begins a relationship with Selma Bouvier, whom he meets when she gives him an eye test at the Department of Motor Vehicles. The relationship revives his career, leading him to star in Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!, a stage musical version of the film Planet of the Apes. To further boost McClure's career, McClure's agent suggests that he get married. Unaware of McClure's motivation, Selma accepts his proposal, and moves into McClure's house, a Modernist building which resembles the <b>Chemosphere.</b> At his bachelor party, a drunken McClure tells Homer Simpson that the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Homer says nothing at the wedding, but later offhandedly mentions McClure's admission to Marge, who then informs her sister. Selma decides to remain with McClure anyway, but she becomes disturbed when McClure's agent advises the pair {{to have a child}} (since [...] "all the big parts these days are going to family men"). Having a child will secure McClure's casting as McBain's sidekick in McBain IV: Fatal Discharge, but Selma is unwilling to bring a child into a loveless relationship and decides to leave McClure. McClure ultimately gets the role, but turns it down in order to direct and star in his own pet project, a 20th Century Fox film called The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel.|$|E

2500|$|Lautner ingeniously {{solved the}} problem of the 45-degree slope by siting the entire house off the ground atop a 50-foot (15m) {{concrete}} pillar that rests on a massive concrete pad 20 feet (6.1m) in diameter and 3 feet (0.91m) thick, buried into the rocky hillside. Halfway up the pillar, eight angled steel [...] "spokes"— bolted onto bosses formed onto the surface of the column— splay out and up, supporting and stabilizing the outer rim of the house, and the center of the pillar also houses the utility cables and pipes. Lautner provided access from the driveway up the steep hillside by installing a funicular, which terminates at a short sloping gangway that leads up to the entrance. The house is octagonal in plan and lozenge-shape in section, and is often described as a [...] "flying saucer".

Chem Seal provided the experimental coatings and resins to put the house together and inspired the name <b>Chemosphere.</b> (Lautner originally wanted to call the house Chapiteau.)

50|$|The Taschen family {{planned to}} {{commission}} Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas {{to build a}} large new guesthouse {{at the base of}} <b>Chemosphere</b> on the site once owned by Leonard Malin's in-laws.

The plans were later cancelled due to fears the annex would visually compete with the main house. During the first few years the Taschens lived there, the house became locally famous for their parties, where photographer William Claxton and his model wife Peggy Moffitt would carouse with porn stars, jazz musicians and director Billy Wilder.|$|E

A studio head, someone who is in firm command and has his hand in everything.” In turn, Matt Weiner, creator and producer of the hit series Mad Men, described Taschen as “a miracle of taste in publishing … He consistently maintains incredible quality in content and style … He documents both {{the present and the}} past in an indispensable way.” ...|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{stands on}} the San Fernando Valley side of the Hollywood Hills, just off Mulholland Drive. It is a one-story octagon with around 2200 square feet (200 m2) of living space. Most distinctively, the house is perched atop a 5 ft concrete pole nearly 30 ft high. This innovative design was Lautner's solution to a site that, with a slope of 45 degrees, {{was thought to be}} practically unbuildable. Because of a concrete pedestal, almost 20 ft in diameter, buried under the earth and supporting the post, the house has survived earthquakes and heavy rains.
