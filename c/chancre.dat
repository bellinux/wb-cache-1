25|$|The gold {{standard}} for diagnosis is identification of trypanosomes in a patient sample by microscopic examination. Patient samples {{that can be used}} for diagnosis include <b>chancre</b> fluid, lymph node aspirates, blood, bone marrow, and, during the neurological stage, cerebrospinal fluid. Detection of trypanosome-specific antibodies can be used for diagnosis, but the sensitivity and specificity of these methods are too variable to be used alone for clinical diagnosis. Further, seroconversion occurs after the onset of clinical symptoms during a T. b. rhodesiense infection, so is of limited diagnostic use.|$|E
25|$|African trypanosomiasis {{symptoms}} {{occur in}} two stages. The first stage, {{known as the}} hemolymphatic phase, is characterized by fever, headaches, joint pains, and itching. Fever is intermittent, with attacks lasting from a day to a week, separated by intervals of {{a few days to}} a month or longer. Invasion of the circulatory and lymphatic systems by the parasites is associated with severe swelling of lymph nodes, often to tremendous sizes. Winterbottom's sign, the tell-tale swollen lymph nodes along the back of the neck, may appear. Occasionally, a <b>chancre</b> (red sore) will develop at the location of the tsetse fly bite. If left untreated, the disease overcomes the host's defenses and can cause more extensive damage, broadening symptoms to include anemia, endocrine, cardiac, and kidney dysfunctions.|$|E

500|$|The {{informal}} term [...] "canker sore" [...] {{is sometimes}} used, mainly in North America, either {{to describe this}} condition generally, or {{to refer to the}} individual ulcers of this condition, or mouth ulcers of any cause unrelated to this condition. The origin of the word [...] "canker" [...] is thought to have been influenced by Latin, Old English, Middle English and Old North French. In Latin, cancer translates to [...] "malignant tumor" [...] or literally [...] "crab" [...] (related to the likening of sectioned tumors to the limbs of a crab). The closely related word in Middle English and Old North French, <b>chancre,</b> now more usually applied to syphilis, is also thought to be involved. Despite this etymology, aphthous stomatitis is not a form of cancer but rather entirely benign.|$|E
500|$|Syphilis is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. The {{signs and symptoms of}} syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary). The primary stage classically presents with a single <b>chancre</b> (a firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration) but there may be multiple sores. In secondary syphilis a diffuse rash occurs, which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There may also be sores in the mouth or vagina. In latent syphilis, which can last for years, there are few or no symptoms. In tertiary syphilis there are gummas (soft non-cancerous growths), neurological, or heart symptoms. Syphilis has been known as [...] "the great imitator" [...] as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases.|$|E
