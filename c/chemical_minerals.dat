40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{a chronic}} {{disorder}} which mostly results with functional impairment and disability. The {{goal of the}} treatment program is to decrease pain and disability and to increase functional capacity and quality of life. One of the main parts of the treatment is nonpharmacological treatment modalities. These are weight loss, educational programs in modifying lifestyle and joint protective techniques, assistive devices, physical therapy (superficial and deep heat-cold applications, electrotherapeutic modalities, neuromuscular electrical stimulation), exercise and balneotherapy. Exercise therapy includes both aerobic exercise and strengthening programs. Choosing an appropriate exercise program depends on the patient's clinical evaluation and need. Although quadriceps muscle group is the primary stabilizer of knee joint, hamstring group exercises should also be recommended for a full performance. Progressive resistive exercise programs are found to have beneficial effects in pain and mobility. There are large evidence trials on the positive effects in the symptoms of OA of home-based exercise programs. Most of the studies reported the effectiveness of land-based exercises in knee OA patients. However aquatic exercises are another alternative for knee OA patients as it is safe, enjoyable and has no side effects. One of the widely used treatment option is balneotherapy and spa therapy. It {{was found to be}} effective on pain relief, functional capacity and quality of life parameters. Thermal action and <b>chemical</b> <b>minerals</b> {{play a significant role in}} its beneficial effect, however there is not an accepted clear concept about its mechanism. There is growing level of evidence about balneotherapy and spa therapy in the management of knee OA and it seems to take part in some of the treatment recommendations...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMeasurement of soil {{components}} such as microbial population, {{minerals and}} obviously {{the content of}} organic carbon play the important roles for the productivity of crops and plants. The present study was attempted to evaluate the impact of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment on soil for its physical (electrical conductivity), <b>chemical</b> (<b>minerals)</b> and microbial flora (bacteria and fungi). A plot of lands was assigned for this study with some already grown plants. This plot was divided into two parts. One part was considered as control, while another part was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield energy treatment without physically touching and referred as treated. In the treated soil the total bacterial and fungal counts were increased by 546 and 617 %, respectively {{as compared to the}} untreated soil. Additionally, the conductivity of soil of the treated plot was increased by 79 % as compared to the soil of control plot. Apart from microbes, the content of various minerals were also changed in the biofield energy treated soil. The calcium carbonate content showed 2909 ppm in the control, while in the treated soil it was increased to 3943 ppm i. e.   36 % increased. Various other minerals such as nitrogen and potassium were increased by 12 % and 7 %, respectively as compared to the control. Besides, the level of some minerals such as potassium, iron, and chloride were decreased by 9 %, 23 %, and 41 %, respectively as compared to the control. Apart from chemical constituents of soil, the content of organic carbon was also reduced by 8 % in the treated soil as compared to the control soil. The overall results envisaged that the biofield energy treatment on the soil showed a significant improvement in the physical, chemical, and microbial functions of soil component. Thus, improved the conductance, supportive microbes, minerals and overall productivity of crops. In conclusion, the biofield energy treatment could be used as an alternative way to increase the yield of quality crops by increasing soil fertility...|$|E

This can be of particular interest to: 1. Teachers / educators of any subject that relates to biochar (physical sciences, plant science, soil science, social science, etc.) 2. Experimenters interested in biochar characterization, including issues of different original biomass {{and the making of}} “designer biochars” by changing production characteristics. 3. Gardeners who also have access to sufficient dry biomass. 4. Anyone supportive of improved cookstoves for impoverished people, including supporters of NGOs working overseas. Production of biochar in small amounts is commonly associated with cooking stoves called TLUD (tee-lud = Top-Lit UpDraft) gasifiers. TLUD pyrolysis is explained and presented in the context of GACC world-wide efforts to introduce 100 million improved cookstoves into impoverished households. Availability of such stoves in North America is discussed, including Do-It-Yourself options, {{the pros and cons of}} such devices, and the potential for introduction of biochar studies into school curricula. This presentation is a good introduction for some activities at the Biochar Tech Field Day on Thursday after the conference. Conversion of Biomass to Biochar in larger custom-built kiln devices - Paul Taylor, PhD. Mt. Warning, NSW, AU [URL] Small property holders, small farmers and community gardeners seek small-scale biochar production devices that process their waste biomass into biochars or enhanced biochars suitable for their soils. They seek to accomplish this with modest budgets in the 100 ’s to 30, 000 range. In this talk we discuss the principals, fuel supply and quality, energy balance, heating methods, emissions levels and regulatory and safety issues relevant to small-scale kiln design. We exemplify with experience in Australia developing batch reactors ranging in size from recycled 55 gal (200 L) drums, through small in-field pyrolyzers, up to 1 and 2 cubic meter cart kilns, and shipping container sized. We also refer to small continuous feed pyrolyzers developed in farm based enterprises in Australia. We include the use of advanced computational fluid dynamics and combustion models to help optimize the designs. Emphasis has been placed on developing integrated systems that allow farmers to use biochar at low application rates. Two systems will be highlighted: one provides process heat for animal pens, and combines the biochar with compost into a granulated pellet; the other produces a synthetic terra preta granule that can be fully organic or a mixture of <b>chemical,</b> <b>minerals</b> and biochar. Jolly Roger Ovens - Biochar making devices for gardeners and small farmers in North America: Karl Frogner 2 ̆ 6 Doug Clayton [URL] “Jolly Roger Ovens” (J-RO’s), inspired John Rogers’ work with 200 liter TLUD’s, are a family of biochar making devices capable of producing 1 to 3 cu-ft per hour of high adsorbing biochar from thinly distributed but widely available feedstocks. Constructed from steel drums and commonly available components, they are easy to build and with minimal practice can perform in a clean, smoke free, manner. While large TLUD’s are often thought to be the province of the developing world (e. g. the work of RE:Char), they also may fill the unmet demand for biochar in the forward thinking, early adopter, communities of organic growers, community organizations, permaculture enthusiasts, etc. The presentation will cover simple, natural draft, J-RO designs based on 200 liter carbon steel drums, retort and forced draft augmentations, as well as potentials for improvements and scaling up or down. Feed stock options and strategies for gathering, handling and pre-treating them will also be discussed. Suggestions for community projects for producing biochar for local use with J-RO’s will be covered. There will be a brief mention of post production treatments trialed by the authors...|$|E
