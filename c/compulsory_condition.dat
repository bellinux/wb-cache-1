40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to define factors that {{contribute}} to the use or non-use of seat belts. Legislation prescribing compulsory seat belt usage is one of the most important factors. Promotion of the use of seat belts without this legislation is very difficult and time-consuming. So far, the most effective means of promoting voluntary use has been the implementation of incentive programmes. They have shown to increase seat belt use, also under <b>compulsory</b> <b>conditions.</b> In countries with the highest rates of seat belt use, such as Germany, Great Britain and the Scandinavian countries, the best results have been achieved through legislation, making non-use punishable, and through intense information and publicity aigns.

To highlight the importance of this, we present our attacks on three recently proposed image encryption schemes...|$|E

Secondly, even with the encouragement of incentives to comply, practitioners are skeptical in becoming green due to: (a) a lack of true understanding of the benefit of ecologically friendly procedures (the practice of profits versus the theory of benefits); (b) lack of short term gain in life cycle costing (practitioners want instant incentives); and (c) mostly, because it is not a legal requirement {{for the vast majority of}} municipalities.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Triangulations of a {{connected}} subset F of parametric surfaces S(u,v) (with continuity C 2 or higher) {{are required}} because a C 0 approximation of such F (called a FACE) is widely required for finite element analysis, rendering, manu-facturing, design, reverse engineering, etc. The triangulation T {{is such an}} approx-imation, when its piecewise linear subsets are triangles (which, on the other hand, is not a <b>compulsory</b> <b>condition</b> for being C 0). A serious obstacle for algorithms which triangulate in the parametric space u − v is that such a space may be ex-tremely warped, and the distances in parametric space be dramatically different of the distances in R 3. Recent publications have reported parameter-independent triangulations, which triangulate in R 3 space. However, such triangulations are not sensitive to the curvature of the S(u,v). The present article presents an algorithm to obtain parameter-independent, curvature-sensitive triangulations. The invariant of the algorithm is that a vertex v of the triangulation if identified, and a quasi-equilateral triangulation around v is performed on the plane Π tangent to S(u,v) at v. The size of the triangles incident to v {{is a function of}} K(v), the curvature of S(u,v) at v.

As the authorities of public administration conducts a broad activity in the state, having as employees a large number of civil servants, it is absolutely necessary for the state to establish an adequate system of organs, endowed with control powers, that are able to ensure the legality in the administration, that is all the employees (civil servants) obey the rules of law.

30|$|Executive summary The first sectoral {{minimum wage}} in Germany was {{introduced}} in the main construction sector on January 1 st, 1997. This article summarizes the results of this introduction which was analyzed in detail within the scope of the study “Evaluation bestehender gesetzlicher Mindestlohnregelungen – Branche: Bauhauptgewerbe” commissioned by the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (BMAS). One of the main reasons for the introduction of a minimum wage in the construction sector was to protect workers against foreign competition by posting foreign workers to Germany. By passing the Posting of Workers Law in 1996, <b>compulsory</b> working <b>conditions</b> (and thus minimum wages) apply for German employees as well as for posted workers. The main focus of the article is on the analyses of the minimum wage impacts on wages and employment in the main construction sector. Additional aspects comprise worker protection and competition. The analyses are conducted on different observational levels (individual, sectoral and regional) in order to obtain a comprehensive picture. We use a difference-in-differences approach classifying observations into treatment and control groups in order to isolate possible impacts of the minimum wage introduction from other influences like the business cycle. We follow two alternative strategies to assign the treatment and control group. First, directly affected individuals or establishments are compared to those not directly affected within the main construction sector. Second, we conduct a comparison between individuals or establishments in the main construction sector and selected control industries.|$|R

The author studies ritual models of behavior {{in the context of}} traditional culture, Christian religion as well as modern society. There is substantiated the impossibility for society to function without ritual scenarios. There is is investigated the role of ritual in traditional society. Ritual is interpreted as the only possible way of experiencing critical situations, transition periods and calendar lifecycles. On the example of individual socialization there is described function of conversion of natural in cultural through ritual. The author proves the ability of ritual to satisfy human needs in creation, ordering of the world and belonging to the divine. Ritual is also considered as a <b>compulsory</b> <b>condition</b> of succession of generations and strengthening ties inside the community. There is described the existence of ritual within the Christian religion. The author analyzes the origins of some traditional Christian holidays.

40|$|T {{lymphocytes}} are {{effector cells}} of the adaptive immune system and {{play a central role}} in the defense against pathogens. In addition, there are numerous indications that T cells play a pathogenic role in autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and HTLV- 1 -associated myelopathy (HAM). In addition, in vitro and experimental in vivo data suggest that T cells are capable of inhibiting tumor cell growth. The here presented scientific data focuses on the analysis of cellular and molecular mechanisms of T cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory signals during T cell activation and inhibition of activation-induced cell death (AICD) with a special emphasis on MS, HAM and the immunomodulation of tumor cells. By means of the TCR, T cells recognize peptides presented by antigen presenting cells (APC). However, apart from foreign peptides, APCs present self-peptides to T lymphocytes. To protect the organism from activation of autoreactive T cells, the negative selection of T cells with high affinity for self-peptides in the thymus is supplemented by the need for T cell costimulation in the periphery. Here, costimulation adds to the TCR-mediated stimulus and facilitates the transgression of the threshold for T cell activation. While naïve T cells generally require a costimulatory signal apart from a TCR signal for activation, the same is not true for T effector cells. The detection of T effector cells which are specific for a candidate antigen of MS in the peripheral blood of MS patients, therefore supports the hypothesis of their pathogenic role in MS. Similarly, the notion that HTLV- 1 plays a pathogenic role in HAM is supported, among others, by the observation that HTLV- 1 infection renders infected T cells independent of costimulation. While costimulation appears to be no <b>compulsory</b> <b>condition</b> for the activation of T effector cells, costimulatory signals protect T effector cells from AICD. To this end, coculture with dendritic cells facilitates inhibition of AICD through ligation of several types of costimlatory molecules, while immunomodulated tumor cells are capable of hampering AICD by ligation of a single costimulatory molecule type. Furthermore, the nature of the APC appears to be important during T cell activation, e. g. necrotic tumor cells are not capable of directly activating T lymphocytes. In summary, the here presented data expand the knowledge of cellular and molecular mechanisms of T cell activation and inhibition of AICD and facilitate the improvement of immunotherapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and malignant tumors...|$|E

PM Goh further emphasized that the policy was not intended to close down the madrasahs, and the Government’s willingness to support one madrasah from primary to secondary level was testimony to its recognition of the importance of madrasahs.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to examine <b>compulsory</b> schools' {{material}} <b>conditions</b> in relation to students' learning opportunities and schools staffs’ opportunities to educate. The thesis consists of four published peer-reviewed articles. The empirical data was collected through extensive fieldwork during 2010 - 2011 in three Swedish schools (ages 14 - 15), characterized by different social demographics. The material is primarily classroom observations, semi-structured interviews and policy documents. Analysis in the thesis draws mainly on Pierre Bourdieu’s theoretical framework, but also on contemporary developments institutional habitus by Diane Reay and positional capital by Jacques Lévy. Also, materiality as an educational concept is used to reflect and discuss schools’ prerequisites as institutions of education. The first article investigates how school practice emerges for pupils and the importance it has on {{their perceptions of their}} own lives in the school, it also considers and discusses the utility of the theoretical tool school habitus. The study was furthermore a critical examination of the reproductive and/or social levelling effects that school practice could have on pupils. The second article explores and compares the schools' access to ICT and classroom teaching. The third article examines the role of the family and its importance for school staff and pupils in the daily operations of the school. In addition, it scrutinizes how socioeconomic conditions affect the middle- and working-class schools' abilities to navigate in relation to families. The fourth article examines material conditions in all three schools with a focus on pupils and school staffs’ perceptions and actions in school practices, and how materiality shapes schools' institutional habitus. The analysis displays that schools’ materiality has major significance for the forms of institutional habitus and which ideals and values about education are developed in the different schools. It also displays that schools’ material conditions are closely interwoven with pupils’ educational backgrounds and the socioeconomic structure of the local neighbourhood. Schools’ material preconditions affect the pedagogical work of the teachers in classrooms and principals’ acting space to follow and implement the schools’ missions according to steering documents. Viewed as preworld, the local area and resources in the schools shape pupils’ sense of worthiness and thus their visions of a possible future in regard to educational and- workinglife carriers. The thesis discusses and concludes that the title The Subtle Inequality illustrate a process where phenomenon such as school choice, teacher shortage or schools’ abilities to compete are taken for granted. They are seen as “natural” and given, thus they hide the existing, objective material preconditions as the sources that shape differences in the educational system. To overcome these differences, the thesis reflects on the need to give all schools in Sweden equal material starting points...|$|R
