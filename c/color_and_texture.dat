5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis {{differs from}} other boletes in the {{covering}} of the cap, which superficially resembles that {{found on the}} surface of Boletellus ananas and Strobilomyces strobilaceus, but the scales are more rigid with a somewhat conical shape. It can be distinguished from these two species by both its bay-brown color, and the absence of a veil. Both of the other species mentioned possess a conspicuous veil, and the former is tan to brown with a pinkish tint, while the latter is dark brown or black. Boletus edulis is separated from A.mirabilis by the <b>color</b> <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> of the cap, tubes and stem. Boletus coniferarum turns blue when bruised and has a very bitter taste. Aureoboletus projectellus is also similar in appearance to Aureoboletus mirabilis, but is found in eastern North America.|$|E

5|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} (Thomomys bulbivorus), {{also known as}} the camas rat or Willamette Valley gopher, is a rodent, the largest member in the genus Thomomys, of the family Geomyidae. First {{described}} in , it is endemic to the Willamette Valley of northwestern Oregon in the United States. The herbivorous gopher forages for vegetable and plant matter, which it collects in large, fur-lined, external cheek pouches. Surplus food is hoarded in an extensive system of underground tunnels. The dull-brown-to-lead-gray coat changes <b>color</b> <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> over the year. The mammal's characteristically large, protuberant incisors are well adapted for use in tunnel construction, particularly in the hard clay soils of the Willamette Valley. The gophers make chattering sounds with their teeth; males and females make purring (or crooning) sounds when they are together, and the young make twittering sounds. Born toothless, blind and hairless, the young grow rapidly before being weaned at about six weeks of age.|$|E
5|$|The <b>color</b> <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> of the coyote's fur varies {{somewhat}} geographically. The hair's predominant {{color is}} light gray and red or fulvous, interspersed {{around the body}} with black and white. Coyotes living at high elevations {{tend to have more}} black and gray shades than their desert-dwelling counterparts, which are more fulvous or whitish-gray. The coyote's fur consists of short, soft underfur and long, coarse guard hairs. The fur of northern subspecies is longer and denser than in southern forms, with the fur of some Mexican and Central American forms being almost hispid (bristly). Generally, adult coyotes (including coywolf hybrids) have a sable coat color, dark neonatal coat color, bushy tail with an active supracaudal gland, and a white facial mask. Albinism is extremely rare in coyotes; {{out of a total of}} 750,000 coyotes harvested by federal and cooperative hunters between March22, 1938, and June30, 1945, only two were albinos.|$|E

25|$|A {{series of}} {{changes to the}} book suggest Houghton Mifflin printed the first edition several times. The {{earliest}} copies show the same bowing hobbit emblem on the title page as is visible on the cover, but in outline. At some point, however, the publisher replaced the emblem on the title page with a seated flautist. This earliest printing also has no half-title page. The first two printings mistakenly identify Chapter VII as Chapter VI on page 118, a defect corrected in the third. While generally similar in all the variants, the binding's cloth changes in <b>color</b> <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> in step with other changes. The first printing's table of illustrations lists Thrór's map as the front endpaper, {{in accordance with the}} text (page 30) but contradicting the actual order. The later printings of the first edition list the Wilderland map as the front endpaper, in accordance with the actual order but contradicting the text. This mess was not fully straightened out until the second edition.|$|E
25|$|It {{is known}} as the gray-sac winged bat first because of the sacs located between the wrist and the neck on the {{membrane}} of the wing, which is far more prominent and developed in males than in females. This sac is a defining feature: in this bat, the sac is {{in the center of the}} antebrachial membrane, while in others it is not centrally located. There have been reports that the inside of this sac is white, but others have stated that it varies in <b>color</b> <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> depending on the age of the bat and the season. Whichever the case, the sac has a proximal opening. The second reason this bat {{is known as}} the gray sac- winged bat is because of its coloring, which can range from the gray color it is known for to a rich brown; despite the differences, all varieties have white trim. It has darker colored fur on its back (dorsal) and lighter covered fur on its front (ventral).|$|E
25|$|Pasta is {{generally}} a simple dish, but comes in many varieties {{due to its}} versatility. Some pasta dishes are served as a first course in Italy because the portion sizes are small and simple. Pasta is also prepared in light lunches, such as salads or large portion sizes for dinner. It can be prepared by hand or food processor and served hot or cold. Pasta sauces vary in taste, <b>color</b> <b>and</b> <b>texture.</b> When choosing which type of pasta and sauce to serve together, {{there is a general}} rule regarding compatibility. Simple sauces like pesto are ideal for long and thin strands of pasta while tomato sauce combines well with thicker pastas. Thicker and chunkier sauces have the better ability to cling onto the holes and cuts of short, tubular, twisted pastas. The extra sauce left on the plate after all of the pasta is eaten is often mopped up with a piece of bread. Pasta is largely carbohydrates (mainly as starch), with moderate amounts of protein and manganese.|$|E

25|$|Fox species {{differ in}} fur color, length, and density. Coat colors range from pearly white to {{black and white}} to black flecked with white or grey on the underside. Fennec foxes (and other species of fox adapted {{to life in the}} desert, such as kit foxes), for example, have large ears and short fur to aid in keeping the body cool. Arctic foxes, on the other hand, have tiny ears and short limbs as well as thick, {{insulating}} fur, which aid in keeping the body warm. Red foxes, by contrast, have a typical auburn pelt, the tail normally ending with white marking. A fox's coat <b>color</b> <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> may vary due to the change in seasons; fox pelts are richer and denser in the colder months and lighter in the warmer months. To get rid of the dense winter coat, foxes moult once a year around April; the process begins from the feet, up the legs, and then along the back. Coat color may also change as the individual ages.|$|E

500|$|In the {{original}} Broadway production, {{the stage was}} completely open, with no curtain and the fly area and grid exposed to the audience. [...] The proscenium arch was outlined with climb-ready scaffolding. [...] Wagner's spare set was painted in shades of grey with street graffiti stenciled on the stage. [...] The stage was raked, and a tower of abstract scaffolding upstage at the rear merged a Native American totem pole and a modern sculpture of a crucifix-shaped tree. [...] This scaffolding was decorated with found objects that the cast had gathered {{from the streets of}} New York.

500|$|The game's cutscenes {{were first}} drafted using a storyboard, {{then when the}} {{sequence}} of events had been finalized, motion capture was used to create the scene in a digitized format. Lighting and environmental effects were then put in place. One of the most challenging sequences to create was the opening real-time cutscene for the Limsa Lominsa story route: the giant sea serpent's fins were each individually animated. The game's opening cinematic was produced by Visual Works, Square Enix's in-house CGI development company. All the in-game models were first created in high-resolution form using a 3D sculpturing program, then readjusted so they could appear in the game with a lower polygon count but equivalent graphical quality. Another large part of creating the characters was their accessories: to help with this, the team developed a multi-layered development system. A technique dubbed [...] "polygon shaving" [...] was used so two sets of equipment could be designed to look different while using the same model data. Another function dubbed [...] "reshaping" [...] was used to adjust the shapes of equipment and accessories. The third element, dubbed [...] "SSD-file", enabled the adjustment of the [...] "materials" [...] equipment was made off, so its <b>color</b> <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> could be changed. Rather than relying on a single design image, which would have been impractical for the hardware, the team took basic art and used Photoshop to add subtle changes to each. It was then passed down to the modeling team, who used the same sculpting process as was used for the game's monsters to create high-detail models while keeping the polygon count low.|$|E
