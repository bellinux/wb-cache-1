An efficient multimodal and intermodal transportation system reduces transportation and supply <b>chain</b> <b>transaction</b> costs and increases connectivity, reliability, and accessibility to local and global markets.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} an electronic trade scenario as an aid to the management of (global) supply chains, and other forms of international, businessto -business electronic commerce. The problem addressed is the following. Competition demands that trade transactions be handled efficiently and securely. However, the same competitive environment also demands flexibility, and the ability to re-design the supply chain as conditions change. Current advances in electronic document technologies, notably XML schemas, ebXML, offer new possibilities for generic, resusable component software at the level of document specifications. Here we address the additional challenge of supporting the rapid re-engineering of the process specifications for the supply chain. For this, we focus on the component technologies for electronic trade scenarios: generic, reusable models of the entire trade transaction. They are stored in a on-line repository, where each member of the supply chain can download the transaction component for their role in the transaction. We describe a CASE tool, called InterProcs, which provides a graphical modeling internface for supply chain process specifications at several levels of abstraction, including Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Documentary Petri Nets (DPN). Once specified, InterProcs auotmatically produces an operating prototyping of the supply <b>chain</b> <b>transaction</b> model.

40|$|The {{advent of}} a credit risk market has profoundly altered {{the role of}} banking firms into one of asset {{originator}} and asset distributor rather than the asset holder. Banks have traditionally originated and held credit risk. It emphasis the different role of financial institutions from holders of credit risk to originators and distributors of credit risk. In this paper I aim to evaluate how the modularity and the standardization create the precondition {{for the creation of}} a credit risk transfer market in the banking industry. The intermediate market of credit risk transfer appears when the banking production processes have become more disintegrated. The vertical disintegration of the banking industry and the creation of a credit risk transfer market enables the shifting from a firm-based governance to a market-based governance. Furthermore, this paper proposes that modularity and standardization drives the creation and growth of credit risk transfer market. With the improvement of credit risk measurement methodologies and risk management practices the credit risk transfer market requires standardization and modularisation of bank lending value <b>chain.</b> <b>Transaction</b> cost economics, the dominant paradigm for understanding make or buy decisions, represents the starting point of my research.

There {{has been a lot}} of research and studies on E-invoicing. This study is going to study on how E-invoicing operators could create value but from users' perspective. The study is going to build its own value creation framework based on Amit and Zott's value creation model in E-business, which defines four value creation dimensions, i. e., efficiency, complementarity, lock-in and novelty. First, extensive literature reviews on value creation theories, including value <b>chain,</b> <b>transaction</b> cost economy, resource-based view of firms and network economy, were conducted. Besides, enterprise application integration and expert opinion were also taken into consideration. As a result, the new value creation framework came out with four modified value drivers, namely efficiency, complementary services, integration and network effects. The changes were made because it is more suitable in the context of E-invoicing. Furthermore, for each of the value drivers, a set of measurement items were identified to evaluate how an E-invoicing operator performed in providing the service. In the empirical part, two case studies are completed. Interviews were prepared and done with E-invoicing managers inside the company. It turns out that all the four value creation sources, efficiency, complementary services, integration and network effects, are observed in the company. As users of E-invoicing, the companies thought E-invoicing improves efficiency by reducing the invoice cycle time, saving costs, and eliminating human touch in the process. Supplier activation is seen as an important area where operators could improve their services. Integration of systems especially automatic accounting is regarded as the future development of E-invoicing but not yet under development in practice. Standardization is needed to enable E-invoice usage between different operators and networks. This study is important in providing a new perspective on E-invoicing research and development. It not only contributes to the E-invoicing literature but also could act as guidance for E-invoicing operators on how to improve their services. It has limitations such as on the resources of information and future research areas are identified.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is intended to}} serve as a gentle but complete introduction to the architectural design elements of NSpace, a proof-of-concept prototype that explores an application infrastructure for a next-generation institutional repository. The NSpace architecture combines a number of emerging technologies to provide a flexible, modular framework for institutional repository development. The NSpace prototype uses a representational state transfer (REST) model for client/server communication, and employs a staged event-drive architecture (SEDA) manager for dynamic resource control and adaptive overload management; it also uses an inversion of control (IoC) container for runtime configuration of participating components. The NSpace framework cleanly separates client interfaces ("frontends") from server implementation details ("backend"). Frontends communicate with one or more backend servers using protocol-neutral transaction objects ("transactions") : clients embed transactions inside service request objects ("requests") that implement protocol details (i. e. the XML-over-HTTP "RESTful" communication model), and then execute the request. Request execution by the client replicates the transaction object to the backend server, which services the transaction and replicates the completed transaction object back to the client. All details of request execution are completely encapsulated by the service request object: from the client's point of view, the state of the transaction object simply changes across the call to the execution method. Although RESTful service requests are the current default implementation for NSpace, the architecture is designed to easily incorporate additional protocols (web services et al.) with a minimum of effort. The NSpace framework also modularizes the implementations of supporting code ("support modules") within the backend server. Individual modules are written as POJOs ("plain old Java objects") that include a transaction-handling method (one that receives a transaction object, performs processing activity on it, and returns it to the framework for further processing). Modules are assembled into sequences of cooperating instances ("chains"), which are then made remotely accessible through servicing endpoints ("services"). When the framework replicates a client transaction object, it is queued to the first module in the appropriate <b>chain.</b> <b>Transaction</b> "fall through" the chains, with each participating module given its turn to perform work; {{at the end of the}} chain, the completed transaction object is delivered back to the originating client. Again, the framework encapsulates and manages all runtime queueing and dequeuing operations as transactions move through the servicing chains: from the individual module's point of view, its processing method is simply invoked once per transaction passing through it. Most usefully, the transaction objects (represented as Java interfaces in code, or as DTDs in REST/XML representation) assume the role of the protocol-neutral, implementation-independent fundamental units of work done by the institutional repository. Development of frontend interfaces, client/server communication methods, and backend functionality implementations each become largely independent of each other, since each "end" of the code is insulated from changes by the common ground of the transaction objects. The NSpace project is also exploring the current state-of-the-art in coding techniques and practices: using Subversion as a source code repository; JUnit for unit testing; Maven for project management; and Eclipse for integrated code authoring...|$|E

40|$|Supply chain {{management}} {{is emerging as}} {{an important source of}} competitive advantage for agribusinesses globally and in South Africa. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe and analyse the emerging governance structures in agribusiness supply chains. Governance structures are the formal and informal institutions that prohibit, permit, or require certain actions and provide the incentives for exchange. Agribusiness managers can choose from a continuum of governance structures which include spot or cash markets, specifications contract, relation-based alliance, equity-based alliance and vertical integration. These structures are distinguished by the composition of market and managed control of the transaction processes. In this study the constructivist and positivist inquiry paradigms were adopted to address the complexity and interrelation of factors involved in the choice of governance structure. The study was conducted in two stages. The first stage entailed a survey of agribusiness managers to elicit their opinions and perceptions on the strategic direction, preferred present and future coordination mechanisms, strategic focus, the future shape of the agro-food industry and the major factors driving these trends in the South African agribusiness complex. These were compared with global trends. This section was conducted in the positivist paradigm to extend the validation and generalisation of the second stage which was conducted in the constructivist paradigm. The second stage entailed the analysis of three case studies to identify the drivers for supply chain formation and the expression of these drivers, strategic considerations and transaction characteristics in appropriate governance structures. The choice of governance structure is influenced by the drivers of change, product characteristics, processes of the supply <b>chain,</b> <b>transaction</b> characteristics and costs. The most significant drivers of change were company competency, consumer behaviour and technology. The perishable nature of most agricultural products, in particular, requires special control and traceability systems to ensure chain transparency in order to certify and assure consumer safety and product quality. These drivers, product characteristics and systems determine the characteristics of the required transaction to facilitate the creation of customer value. Key concepts that emerged in the description of transaction costs are bounded rationality, opportunism, asset specificity and information asymmetry. The optimal governance structure maximises desired transaction requirements while minimising the costs of exchange. The analysis of the case studies showed that these factors cannot be considered in isolation. In each of the cases a different factors was instrumental in the determination of the optimal governance structure. The study identifies a six step decision process for agribusiness managers and researchers to relate drivers of competitiveness to appropriate governance structures. The emergence of supply chains is driven by evolving consumer demands and societal values on the one hand and the need for agribusiness and inter-agribusiness competency to transform these needs and values into consumer value on the other hand. South African agribusiness are employing technology and closer vertical coordination to improve production processes, quality assurance, traceability and process transparency. In line with global trends South African agribusiness will have to establish ever more sophisticated systems to satisfy consumer needs and societal values as these evolve to include less tangible needs and values such as environmental and ethical concerns.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the non-equity entry mode decisions of international hotel organisations. To date, relatively {{few studies have}} examined entry mode choice {{in the context of the}} service sector as compared with that of the manufacturing sector, and fewer still have considered it in the context of the hotel industry. Moreover, studies focused on the choice between equity and non-equity entry modes by far outnumber studies focused on the choice between different non-equity modes. This gap needs to be filled because the majority of the entry modes used in the international hotel industry are non-equity in nature. This thesis presents empirical research based on the theoretical foundation of new institutional economics on the choice between non-equity entry modes in the hotel industry – specifically on the choice between franchising and management contracts, known as asset-light modes by practitioners. Moreover, to the knowledge of the author, this is the first thesis to gather both qualitative and quantitative primary data from hotel executives who are at the strategic level as opposed to from hotel general managers or other operational-level employees in the hotel industry. This thesis comprises two studies, each with its own literature review. Study 1 is qualitative in nature, with in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with eight hotel executives. The primary objective of this study was to empirically examine which of the predominant theories of new institutional economics are the most appropriate for examining the specific choice between franchising and management contracts when internationalising a hotel or hotel <b>chain.</b> <b>Transaction</b> cost economics and the resource- based view emerged as the most appropriate theories, according to the executives interviewed. Specifically, the executives suggested that the considerations of asset specificity from transaction cost economics and imperfect imitability from the resource- based view are important in the decision. Moreover, several other considerations were suggested, including the size of the organisation, the importance of intangible assets and the level of investment into these assets. Finally, host country factors, such as legal and political risk, as well as the availability of capable local partners, were suggested as important considerations. Study 2 is quantitative in nature, with a self-selected dual scenario-based online survey (a franchise scenario and a management contract scenario) of 109 hotel executives. The primary objective of this study was to develop and test hypotheses through the combined theoretical lenses of transaction cost economics and the resource-based view as well as the findings from Study 1. These hypotheses were tested by initially examining whether the two groups of respondents differ in their opinion of the importance they attached to the independent variables in their entry mode decision through analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). This was followed by a discriminant function analysis to see if the variables allowed the prediction of group membership. These analyses were chosen because of their complementary and inter- confirmatory nature. The findings show that intangible assets and resources are one of the most important considerations in deciding between franchising and management contracts when internationalising a hotel or hotel chain, and that they prompt management contracts. Moreover, it was also found that uncertainties in the host market may lead hotel executives to choose franchising over management contracts, and finally, that asset specificity may prompt the use of management contracts over franchising...|$|E

In supply chain systems, however, a variety of information security shortcomings is currently occurring in several processes, for example, related to data confidentiality. The Data Pipeline principle has been proposed to improve the security and quality of supply chain information systems. In a first elaboration, the Distributed Trust Backbone (DTB) model was designed. The DTB consists of a set of core components and protocols having the aim to enable secure information exchange. Next, a prototype has been implemented using computer systems available in three countries spread over the world.
