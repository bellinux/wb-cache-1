Furthermore, {{since the advent of}} the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 (<b>children</b> <b>here</b> defined as under 18), almost {{every country in the world}} (except the U.S. and South Sudan) has legally committed to advancing an anti-discriminatory stance towards young people of all ages. This includes protecting children against unchecked child labor, enrollment in the military, prostitution, and pornography.|$|E

Beethoven often visited the von Breuning household, where he taught piano to some of the <b>children.</b> <b>Here</b> he encountered German and classical literature. The von Breuning family environment was less stressful than his own, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline.

Captain Ogden slipped through the lines at night to raise a relief column in Philadelphia. The relief force was ambushed by the Yankees and lost their baggage and supplies. After a month-long siege, Fort Wyoming capitulated on August 15, 1771, {{and there would be}} peace in the Wyoming Valley for the next four years, in which Stewart and his militiamen could enjoy the cultivation of the lands granted them for their military services.

Aamir Khan, Tisca Chopra, Vipin Sharma, Sachet Engineer, {{and the rest}} of the cast and crew were present. In his speech, Khan stated, [...] "Darsheel is a very happy child, full of life and vibrant. I am sure it's because of the way his parents and teachers have treated him. I must say Darsheel's principal Mrs. Bajaj has been extremely supportive and encouraging. The true test of any school is how happy the kids are and by the looks of it, the <b>children</b> <b>here</b> seem really happy." ...|$|E

He finds few birds despite constant searching and wading through rivers; the water and the rough ground destroy both his pairs of shoes, and he returns home on the last day lame from walking [...] "in my stockings very painfully". Sailing in the Matabello Islands, he is blown ten miles off course, his men fearing being swept on to the coast of New Guinea [...] "in which case we should most likely all be murdered" [...] as the tribes there are treacherous and bloodthirsty. He is sorry to see that even the smallest <b>children</b> <b>here</b> all chew betel-nut and are disfigured by sores from a poor diet. However he enjoys their palm wine which he finds more like cider than beer, and the [...] "water" [...] inside young coconuts, which, he explains, is nothing like the undrinkable contents of the old dry coconuts on sale in England. He buys a prau and surprises the people by fitting it out himself, using tools [...] "of the best London make", but lacking a large drill the holes have to be made, very slowly, by boring with hot iron rods. Travelling round Ceram, the crew from Goram run away. He describes in detail the process of making sago.|$|E

2500|$|This was {{the reason}} that {{despite a lack of}} schooling, {{straight}} after his confirmation, Augustinussen was employed as the communal school teacher by pastor Krogh. The communal school was meant to be preparation for regular school, where children would learn [...] "how to read" [...] and [...] "the understanding of words". From 1826 he was also a home tutor for pastor Krogh's <b>children.</b> <b>Here</b> he was given access to Krogh's relatively rich library. The regular school in Nesna was built in 1823, 37 years before the common school law of 1860 demanded that schools of more than 30 pupils needed their own school building. It was tradition that the curate was the teacher there. Peter Eggen was finally suspended from his position as curate in 1829 and died the same year. When the curate position became available, Augustinussen was appointed in 1830, at the young age of 22. The curate was also called [...] "choirmaster", and this title was used for Augustinussen among others in connection with parliament. He had this position until he became a pensioner in 1878, thus serving for almost 50 years. He {{was a member of the}} school commission for the same time period, and also led confirmation education when the priest was too busy. Anton Christian Bang said about this that [...] "his gifted and lively teaching was characterized by seriousness without any expressed warmth".|$|E
