40|$|Social impact bonds (SIBs) can {{be defined}} as “a {{mechanism}} that harnesses private capital for social services and encourages outcome achievement by making repayment contingent upon success. ” Since 2010, which marked the advent of the first SIB, 43 have been set up in 11 countries representing an investment of over € 200 million. Public welfare expenditures seek to achieve social impact but not all such expenditures succeed. The enduring nature of many persisting social issues like homelessness and unemployment suggests that varying approaches might be helpful. In this regard, social impact investing seeks to marry social with financial returns. This report describes their locations and policy emphases. It asks whether SIBs are scaling up social innovations and examines the roles commissioners, investors, service delivery organisations and other participants. It examines the focus SIBs place on outcomes and the use of evaluation, and <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems and where the risk is placed. It also discusses whether the reward mechanism of the contract is able to deepen the focus on results throughout the delivery chain. No known SIB had been evaluated ex-post at the time the paper was finalised (mid- 2015) and it is therefore too early to know whether SIBs have produced performance improvements. One of the conclusions of the paper, however, is that though it is often cheaper to pay for public services directly, SIBS have the potential to be more effective because they entail stronger performance management. They also represent a way to access to vast private sector investment resources in fields where policy failure can have very high costs – the advent of SIBs can lead to better learning and increased value for money on targeted interventions. SIBs illustrate the need for continued experimentation in financial models for public service delivery. They may not answer all the questions that they raise, but they have succeeded in asking some important questions about how public money is used to achieve social outcomes and what changes when private money is brought into the mix.

40|$|On 10 January 2002, I {{was asked}} to provide a little expert <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> {{electronic}} <b>monitoring</b> (EM) <b>on</b> BBC Radio Birmingham's ‘Late Show’, the pretext being a newspaper report earlier that day indicating that Scotland was soon to roll out a national EM programme. It was clear when I met her that the show's host {{had no idea that}} electronic monitoring had already been underway in England and Wales for several years. Her immediate reaction to the idea of it was hostile: being sentenced to serve time in one's own living room hardly seemed like punishment. Several callers to the show were invited to <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> it in these terms, and most were adamant that it was obviously no substitute for imprisonment. The experience was, for me, indicative (in microcosm) of the generally poor quality of media debate about EM in England and Wales, and suggested that EM has simply not registered with the public as the tough punishment that its supporters hoped and its opponents feared it would be. This article is a preliminary attempt to map the nature and level of awareness that has been shown about EM in various manifestations of popular culture – the press, TV, cinema and literature – and to tentatively suggest why it has taken the forms that it has. The article understands popular culture primarily as a resource for interpreting and bestowing meaning upon EM but also, more cursorily, considers it as an aspect of the milieu in which creative technological developments are conceived...|$|R

40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen the {{development}} of several out of order, dynamically scheduled superscalar microprocessors. While they have been commercially successful, {{there has been some}} concerns on the effectiveness of out of order execution for commercial workloads. Commercial workloads including web werver, E-commerce and data base workloads are extremely important for future IBM server microprocessors. The primary objective of the proposed project is to determine the usefulness of aggressive out-of-order scheduling in the IBM PowerPC (PPC) processors. The study will utilize the IBM RS 64 -II, PPC 604 e and POWER 3 processors. The performance counters in the respective processors will be used to conduct the measurements. The three aforementioned processors cover the spectrum of PPC machines from in-order microarchitectures to aggressively out of order and speculative microarchitectures. The primary objective of our study will be to measure and identify components of processor performance, and study the effects of speculative and out-of-order execution on resource usage and overall performance. Another objective of the research would be to <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the performance <b>monitoring</b> facility of the PowerPC processors. Overall, the study would result in suggesting useful design directions for future IBM server microprocessors...|$|R
