25|$|Taylor {{built upon}} Heidegger’s work when he {{described}} {{human beings as}} constantly being engaged {{in the process of}} interpreting and re-interpreting themselves using their own unique perspectives based on their thoughts, feelings, and desires. According to Taylor, human beings make sense of their feelings by seeing “them as embodying a judgment about the object they bear on: ‘To experience fear is to experience some object as terrifying or dangerous; to experience shame is to experience some objects as shameful or humiliating” (Taylor: 47, as cited in Richardson et al.: 216). What Taylor is getting at is that Dasein's emotions provides him with a sense of situational understanding and are “affective modes of awareness” (as cited in Richardson et al.: 216). Psychologists practicing ontological hermeneutics in counseling write that this standpoint is in stark contrast to mainstream <b>cognitive</b> <b>approaches</b> which hold that emotions are merely byproducts of our cognitive awareness. Instead, Taylor is taking the cognitive-affective relation out of a linear mode of understanding (thoughts lead to emotions) and placing it phenomenologically in non-linear fashion (thoughts=emotions=interpreted knowledge, meaning they don’t necessarily happen in sequence). This affective mode of awareness serves as more than just knowledge about the world and/or about Dasein, where upon Taylor takes the theory to its logical conclusion: if Dasein's emotions reflect his judgments about the world around him, they also show what is important to him and why. For example, to experience love for another person subjectively informs Dasein that the relationship with that person is important to him. It is through such subjective experience that Dasein's world and his experiences become meaningful to him. Richardson et al. say that this contrast between Taylor’s theory and mainstream approaches has profound implications for conceptualizing human suffering as therapists. Taylor's argument is that emotions are not the mere result of cognitive processes, but subjective judgments about how human beings view their world around them and what is important to them, then it begs questions like what is human suffering, what causes human suffering, is all suffering bad, etc. Taylor, drawing on ontological hermeneutics, takes the phenomenon of human suffering out of the objective, scientific realm (where mainstream psychotherapy has currently placed it) and restores it to the subjective realm of embodied experience. Proponents of ontological hermeneutics state that this is where it rightfully belongs.|$|E

2500|$|Keller is {{best known}} for the ARCS ("Attention, Relevance, Confidence and Satisfaction") model of {{instructional}} design, which he first introduced in 1979. He developed the model in response to previous behaviourist and <b>cognitive</b> <b>approaches</b> to instructional design which Keller argued focused too much on external stimuli and paid insufficient attention to learners' motivation. His ARCS model broke learner motivation down into four components (attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction) and provided strategies for instructors to incorporate each into their courses, thereby encouraging learner motivation. The ARCS model has been widely applied and became a [...] "central reference" [...] for subsequent research into learner motivation.|$|E

2500|$|Theories of {{creativity}} (particularly investigation of {{why some people}} are more creative than others) have focused {{on a variety of}} aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as [...] "the four Ps" [...] — process, product, person, and place (according to Mel Rhodes). A focus on process is shown in <b>cognitive</b> <b>approaches</b> that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking (such as Guilford), or those describing the staging of the creative process (such as Wallas) are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative product usually appears in attempts to measure creativity (psychometrics, see below) and in creative ideas framed as successful memes. The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more.|$|E
2500|$|Jerome Bruner {{is notable}} for {{integrating}} Piaget's <b>cognitive</b> <b>approaches</b> into educational psychology. He advocated for discovery learning where teachers create a problem solving environment {{that allows the}} student to question, explore and experiment. In his book The Process of Education Bruner stated that {{the structure of the}} material and the cognitive abilities of the person are important in learning. He emphasized the importance of the subject matter. He also believed that how the subject was structured was important for the student's understanding of the subject and it is the goal of the teacher to structure the subject {{in a way that was}} easy for the student to understand. [...] In the early 1960s Bruner went to Africa to teach math and science to school children, which influenced his view as schooling as a cultural institution. [...] Bruner was also influential in the development of MACOS, Man a Course of Study, which was an educational program that combined anthropology and science. The program explored human evolution and social behavior. [...] He also helped with the development of the head start program. He was interested in the influence of culture on education and looked at the impact of poverty on educational development.|$|E
