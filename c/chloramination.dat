25|$|US EPA {{drinking}} water quality standards limit chloramine concentration for public water systems to 4 {{parts per million}} (ppm) based on a running annual average of all samples in the distribution system. In order to meet EPA-regulated limits on halogenated disinfection by-products, many utilities are switching from chlorination to <b>chloramination.</b> While <b>chloramination</b> produces fewer regulated total halogenated disinfection by-products, it can produce greater concentrations of unregulated iodinated disinfection byproducts and N-nitrosodimethylamine.

50|$|<b>Chloramination</b> is the {{treatment}} of drinking water with a chloramine disinfectant. Both chlorine and small amounts of ammonia {{are added to the}} water one at a time which react together to form chloramine (also called combined chlorine), a long lasting disinfectant. Chloramine disinfection is used in both small and large water treatment plants.|$|E
50|$|Post-treatment {{consists}} of preparing {{the water for}} distribution after filtration. Reverse osmosis is an effective barrier to pathogens, but post-treatment provides secondary protection against compromised membranes and downstream problems. Disinfection by means of ultra violet (UV) lamps (sometimes called germicidal or bactericidal) may be employed to sterilize pathogens which bypassed the reverse osmosis process. Chlorination or <b>chloramination</b> (chlorine and ammonia) protects against pathogens which may have lodged in the distribution system downstream, such as from new construction, backwash, compromised pipes, etc.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chloramination</b> is also {{becoming}} increasingly common. Disinfection with chloramine produces less undesirable byproducts than chlorine (gas or hypochlorite). Chloramine has a longer half-life {{in the distribution}} system, and maintains effective protection against pathogens. Chloramines persist in the distribution because of their lower redox potential in comparison to free chlorine. Chloramine is formed by adding ammonia and chlorine into drinking water to form monochloramine and/or dichloramine. Whereas Helicobacter pylori can be many times more resistant to chlorine than Escherichia coli, both organisms are about equally susceptible to the disinfecting effect of chloramine.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the recent}} {{discussion}} about chloramine has focused on N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), and {{it is critical to}} distinguish between chloramine and NDMA. NDMA can be a byproduct of <b>chloramination</b> or chlorination, but drinking water is not a major source of exposure to NDMA. The biggest sources of human exposure to NDMA are tobacco smoke, chewing tobacco, bacon and other cured meats, beer, fish, cheese, toiletries, shampoos, cleansers, interior air of cars, and household pesticides. In addition, NDMA can form in the stomach during digestion of foods or drugs that contain alkylamines, which are naturally occurring compounds.|$|E
50|$|The piped {{drinking}} water supplied in most urban areas is treated by chlorination or <b>chloramination,</b> adding {{small amounts of}} substances that inhibit potentially dangerous micro-organisms but are harmless to animals. Some bakers recommend unchlorinated water for feeding cultures. Because a sourdough fermentation relies on microorganisms, using water without these agents may produce better results. Bottled {{drinking water}} is suitable; chlorine, but not chloramines, can be removed from tap water by boiling it for a time, or simply by leaving it uncovered for at least 24 hours. Chlorine and chloramines can both be removed by activated carbon filters and other methods.|$|E
50|$|To {{treat the}} raw water, the bureau uses {{a process called}} <b>chloramination,</b> which disinfects the water with {{chlorine}} then adds ammonia to prolong the chlorine's effectiveness. Although these additives kill microorganisms such as coloform bacteria and giardia that can cause disease in humans, they can react with naturally occurring compounds in water to form other compounds such as trihalomethanes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: False positives for cyanide {{analysis}} in wastewaters have been reported. We {{examined the effects}} of storage time at high pH and of pH adjustments on the cyanide levels.

This study assessed {{the formation of a}} range of disinfection by-products (DBPs) from the <b>chloramination</b> of seven non-nitrogenous LMWOA precursors, with an emphasis on the contribution of N-chloramine incorporation to haloacetamide (HAcAm) formation. The other DBPs comprised chlorinated halomethanes, haloacetonitriles and haloacetic acids. Citric acid generated higher yields of trichloromethane and two chloroacetic acids than the other LMWOAs. Further, the unsaturated acids (fumaric acid and itaconic acid) formed more chloroacetic acids than saturated acids (oxalic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid). Importantly, non-nitrogenous LMWOAs formed three nitrogenous DBPs (dichloroacetamide, trichloroacetamide, and small amounts of dichloroacetonitrile) during <b>chloramination,</b> firstly indicating the monochloramine can supply the nitrogen in nitrogenous DBPs, and the formation of haloacetamides at least in part is independent of the hydrolysis of haloacetonitriles. To the authors’ knowledge, {{this is the first time}} formation of halogenated nitrogenous DBPs (N-DBPs) has been reported from <b>chloramination</b> of non-nitrogenous LMWOA precursors.

40|$|The {{formation}} of disinfection by-products (DBPS) {{is a public}} health concern. An important way to evaluate the presence of DBPs {{is in terms of}} the total organic halogen (TOX), which can be further specified into total organic chlorine (TOCl), bromine (TOBr), and iodine (TOI). The formation and distribution of halogen-specific TOX during chlorination and <b>chloramination</b> of natural organic matter (NOM) isolates in the presence of bromide and iodide ions were studied. As expected, <b>chloramination</b> produced significantly less TOX than chlorination. TOM was the dominant species formed in both chlorination and <b>chloramination.</b> TOI was always produced in <b>chloramination,</b> but not in chlorination when high chlorine dose was used, due to the limited presence of HOI in chlorination {{as a result of the}} oxidation of iodide to iodate in the presence of excess chlorine. The {{formation of}} TOI during <b>chloramination</b> increased as the initial iodide ion concentration increased, with a maximum of similar to 60 % of the initial iodide ion becoming incorporated into NOM. Iodine incorporation in NOM was consistently higher than bromine incorporation, demonstrating that the competitive reactions between bromine and iodine species in <b>chloramination</b> favoured the formation of HOI and thus TOI, rather than TOBr. Correlations between the aromatic character of the NOM isolates (SUVA(254) and % aromatic C) and the concentrations of overall TOX and halogen-specific TOX in <b>chloramination</b> were observed. This indicates that the aromatic moieties in NOM, as indicated by SUVA(254) and % aromatic C, play an important role in the formation of overall TOX and halogen-specific TOX in <b>chloramination.</b> THMs comprised only a fraction of TOX, up to 7 % in <b>chloramination</b> and up to 47 % in chlorination. Although chloramine produces less TOX than chlorine, it formed proportionally more non-THM DBPs than chlorine. These non-THM DBPs are mostly unknown, corresponding to unknown health risks. Considering the higher potential for formation of iodinated DBPs and unknown DBPs associated with the use of chloramine, water utilities need to carefully balance the risks and benefits of using chloramine as an alternative disinfectant to chlorine in order to satisfy guideline values for THMs...|$|E

Compared with chlorination, the formation of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids is reduced by 88 % and 85 % and by 68 % and 65 % in <b>chloramination</b> and Cl- 2 -NH 2 Cl process, respectively. During <b>chloramination,</b> the proportion of brominated-DBPs (Br-DBPs) is lower initially, and then increases afterwards due to the continuous reaction between NOM slow reactive sites and N-bromo amines. Additionally, the ratios of dihalogenated acetic acids to total organic halogen increase continuously from 4. 5 % to 6. 3 % with pre-chlorination and from 4. 3 % to 9. 8 % without pre-chlorination. The halonitriles (HANs) formation during chlorination is the most significant in the initial 30 min at the level of 6. 5 nM, and then decreases to 2. 5 nM after 72 h. During <b>chloramination,</b> however, the formation of HANs increases steadily with prolonged contact time. After 72 -h contact time, the level of HANs in Cl- 2 -NH 2 Cl process is 3. 9 and 2. 5 times of that in chlorination and <b>chloramination,</b> respectively. In Cl- 2 -NH 2 Cl process, HOCl rapidly oxidizes Br- to HOBr, and these two active species react with the fast reactive sites within NOM to form Br-DBPs and the intermediates for nitrogenous DBPs (N-DBPs). The subsequent introduction of ammonia inhibits the hydrolysis and oxidation of the formed N-DBPs and contributes to the most significant formation of N-DBPs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Characteristics, {{including}} fluorescence {{intensity and}} specific UV absorbance (SUVA), of 16 organic matter (OM) fractions isolated from four OM samples plus a standard were analyzed and correlated with their specific disinfection by-product (DBP) and total organic halogen (TOX) formation after <b>chloramination.</b> These isolates {{were obtained from}} various water sources by using XAD- 8 / 4 resins. <b>Chloramination</b> was achieved by adding 20 mg/L monochloramine to a solution containing one OM isolate at 5 mg/L DOC and buffered at pH 7. 5 for 7 days. The fluorescence regional integration (FRI) method was {{used to analyze the}} fluorescence intensity data obtained from excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy, in which the EEM figure was divided into five regions and a normalized fluorescence volume was calculated. The cumulative normalized EEM volumes at regions II and IV (Phi(II+IV,n)) showed linear relationships with the yields of dichloroacetic acid (DCAA) (R- 2 = 0. 60), chloroform (R- 2 = 0. 42), dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) (R- 2 = 0. 53), and TOX (R- 2 = 0. 63). The SUVA values were found to have linear relationships with the yields of DCAA (R- 2 = 0. 82), chloroform (R- 2 = 0. 73), DCAN (R- 2 = 0. 88) and TOX (R- 2 = 0. 80), but not with the yields of cyanogen chloride (CNCl) and chloropicrin (CP). A modified model is proposed to simplify the reactions involving <b>chloramination</b> of OM fractions. FTIR spectra of OM before and after <b>chloramination</b> partially confirmed that ketone groups were reactive with monochloramine. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDisinfection with monochloramine {{is known}} to {{significantly}} reduce the formation of regulated disinfection by-products (i. e. trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids) as compared to chlorination. Moreover, monochloramine {{can be added to}} wastewater prior to reuse processes to avoid biofouling of membranes. However, <b>chloramination</b> favors the formation of N nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a probable human carcinogen. Proposed formation mechanisms used dimethylamine as a model precursor, but some anthropogenic tertiary amines presenting dimethylamine functional groups have been demonstrated to lead to important amounts of NDMA (e. g. ranitidine, a histamine antagonist used for peptic ulcer treatment). In this study, NDMA formation potential of several tertiary amines from the reaction with monochloramine is investigated. Compounds presenting heterocyclic rings substituted with DMA functions (e. g. ranitidine) show much higher conversion rates to NDMA than other tertiary amines or DMA. The concentration of dissolved oxygen was found to play a major role: with ranitidine, in absence of dissolved oxygen almost no NDMA was formed, while the NDMA molar yield was 54 % in saturated O 2 solution. The presence of bromide also significantly enhanced the formation of NDMA during <b>chloramination</b> of dimethylamine and dimethylaminomethyl-furfuryl alcohol. These results are of great concern regarding wastewater reuse, because the <b>chloramination</b> of bromide-containing wastewaters could lead to significant amounts of NDMA...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Chloramination</b> of {{drinking}} waters {{has been associated}} with N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation as a disinfection byproduct. NDMA is classified as a probable carcinogen and thus its formation during <b>chloramination</b> has recently become the focus of considerable research interest. In this study, the formation mechanisms of NDMA from ranitidine and trimethylamine (TMA), as models of tertiary amines, during <b>chloramination</b> were investigated by using density functional theory (DFT). A new four-step formation pathway of NDMA was proposed involving nucleophilic substitution by chloramine, oxidation, and dehydration followed by nitrosation. The results suggested that nitrosation reaction is the rate-limiting step and determines the NDMA yield for tertiary amines. When 45 other tertiary amines were examined, the proposed mechanism was found to be more applicable to aromatic tertiary amines, and there may be still some additional factors or pathways that need to be considered for aliphatic tertiary amines. The heterolytic ONN(Me) 2 −R+ bond dissociation energy to release NDMA and carbocation R+ was found to be a criterion for evaluating the reactivity of aromatic tertiary amines. A structure−activity study indicates that tertiary amines with benzyl, aromatic heterocyclic ring, and diene-substituted methenyl adjacent to the DMA moiety are potentially significant NDMA precursors. The findings of this study are helpful for understanding NDMA formation mechanism and predicting NDMA yield of a precursor...|$|E
40|$|Iodinated {{disinfection}} byproducts (DBPs) {{are generally}} more toxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogues. Up to date, only a few iodinated DBPs in drinking water have been identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In this work, a method for fast selective detection of polar iodinated DBPs was developed using an electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESI-tqMS) by conducting precursor ion scan of iodide at m/z 126. 9. With such a method, pictures of polar iodinated DBPs in chlorinated, chloraminated, and chlorine-ammonia treated water samples were achieved. By coupling state-of-the-art ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) to the ESI-tqMS, structures of 17 iodinated DBPs were tentatively proposed. The results fully demonstrate that, {{with respect to the}} DBP number/levels among the three disinfection processes, <b>chloramination</b> generally generated the most/highest iodinated DBPs, chlorination generally produced the fewest/lowest iodinated DBPs, and chlorine-ammonia sequential treatment formed iodinated DBPs lying in between; the numbers of iodinated DBPs in chloraminated Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA) and Humic Acid (SRHA) were nearly the same, but the levels of aliphatic iodinated DBPs were higher in the chloraminated SRFA while the levels of aromatic iodinated DBPs were higher in the chloraminated SRHA; a couple of nitrogenous iodinated DBPs were found in <b>chloramination</b> and chlorine-ammonia treatment. The ratio of total organic iodine levels in chlorine-ammonia sequential treatment and <b>chloramination</b> could be expressed {{as a function of the}} lag time of ammonia addition...|$|E

Kinetic experiments ([Resorcinol] 0 = 5 or 100 μM, [NH 2 Cl] 0 /[Resorcinol] 0 = 20 mol/mol, pH = 8. 5 ± 0. 1) showed a slow increase of the monochloramine consumption with reaction time. The monochloramine demands after reaction times of 7 days ([Resorcinol] 0 = 100 μM) and 14 days ([Resorcinol] 0 = 5 μM) were equal to 8. 5 mol of NH 2 Cl/mole of resorcinol and were higher than the chlorine demands (≈ 7. 3 mol/mol). Chloroform yields from monochloramination of resorcinol were lower than 8 % (100 mol/mol. The data obtained in the present work suggest that free chlorine released from monochloramine hydrolysis {{plays a significant role}} on the formation of chloroform during <b>chloramination</b> of resorcinol at N/Cl ratios close to unity (1. 0 < N/Cl < 1. 5) ...|$|E
