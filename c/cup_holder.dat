Two weeks after his departure from WWE, Danielson made {{his return to the}} independent circuit on June 26, defeating Eddie Kingston at the CHIKARA event We Must Eat Michigan's Brain in Taylor, Michigan.

On July 3, Danielson returned to wXw, defeating Wade Fitzgerald and TJP in the round robin stage of the Ambition 1 tournament.

500|$|Part of the product's format {{was in its}} packaging, {{which was}} {{designed}} to fit in a car <b>cup</b> <b>holder.</b> The BK Chicken Fry box, while square in shape, will sit comfortably in the <b>cup</b> <b>holder</b> and its top, when opened, forms a small tray that is designed to hold dipping sauce.

Since most of the fast food industry's business is take-out or drive-thru traffic, this allowed the convenience food purchaser to drive and eat with little effort.
