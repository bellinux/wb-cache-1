25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} things to take into consideration when either trying to lose or put on weight is output versus input. It is important to know the amount of energy your body is using every day, so that your intake fits the needs of one's personal weight goal. Someone wanting to lose weight would want a smaller energy intake than what they put out. There is increasing research-based evidence that low-fat vegetarian diets consistently lead to healthy weight loss and management, a decrease in diabetic symptoms as well as improved <b>cardiac</b> <b>health.</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{relationships}} between physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, <b>cardiac</b> autonomic <b>health,</b> and brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentrations in healthy men (n = 28) and women (n = 16). Cardiorespiratory fitness ([Vdot]O 2 max, litres · min- 1) was estimated from heart rate and work rate using a 6 -min cycle ergometer test, <b>cardiac</b> autonomic <b>health</b> was assessed from supine measures of heart rate variability using standard telemetry techniques, physical activity was assessed by questionnaire, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). There was no significant difference in cardiorespiratory fitness between men (3. 75 ± 0. 84 litres · min- 1) and women (3. 43 ± 0. 72 litres · min- 1) (P = 0. 206). Similarly, there was no significant difference in Baecke scores (work, sport, and leisure) between men and women. Cardiorespiratory fitness was significantly correlated with seated heart rate (r = - 0. 445, P = 0. 002, n = 44), the heart rate variability measure SD 12 (index of <b>cardiac</b> autonomic <b>health)</b> (r = 0. 462, P = 0. 035, n = 21), and Baecke sport score (r = 0. 536, P = 0. 000, n = 43). Cardio autonomic health (SD 12) was negatively associated with brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentration although this correlation did not attain statistical significance (r = - 0. 324, P = 0. 152, n = 21). The results show that cardiorespiratory fitness was significantly correlated with the Baecke sport (rather than work or leisure) score and cardiac autonomic function (SD 12). However, SD 12 was not significantly associated with resting concentrations of serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a key regulator of energy metabolism and neural plasticity...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{prospective}} effects of post- myocardial infarction (MI) depressive disorder on health status, including self reported cardiac symptoms, disability, and health related quality of life, at 12 months after MI while controlling for <b>cardiac</b> condition and <b>health</b> status at {{three months after}} MI. Methods: Longitudinal study of a cohort of 468 adults with MI recruited from four hospitals {{in the north of}} the Netherlands between September 1997 and September 2000. Assessment of depressive disorder in the year after MI according to International classification of disease, 10 th revision criteria. Assessment of health status at three and 12 months by the RAND 36 item health survey, the health complaints scale, self rated cardiac complaints, and disability. Results: Patients with post-MI depressive disorder were more likely than those without to have poor quality of life, more <b>health</b> complaints, more <b>cardiac</b> complaints, and more disability at 12 months' follow up. In multivariate analyses adjusted for <b>cardiac</b> condition, <b>health</b> status at three months, age, sex, and pre-MI depression, the prospective association of post-MI depression with poor health status remained for most of the indicators. Severity of the post-MI depression further contributed to aspects of poor health status. Conclusions: In a prospective study design, post-MI depression had strong effects on poor health status exceeding the effects of cardiac condition and its short term consequences. Efforts to improve health status after MI should therefore include standard assessment and guideline based treatment of post- MI depressive disorder...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{heart rate variability}} in women who exercise regularly, but with differing volumes of physical activity. Forty women participated and were allocated to either a "high" or "moderate" activity group. Heart rate as R-R intervals was recorded during supine rest and analysed using time domain, frequency domain, and Poincaré plot techniques. All time domain and Poincaré analysis measures revealed significant differences in heart rate variability between the "high" and "moderate" activity groups. Frequency domain analysis also revealed {{a significant difference between}} the two groups in absolute measures of high-frequency and low-frequency power, but not between measures such as the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio, proposed to represent the sympathetic/parasympathetic balance of cardiac control. The results demonstrate that there is a significant difference in heart rate variability between women who engage in "high" compared with "moderate" volumes of physical activity, which may have implications for <b>cardiac</b> autonomic <b>health.</b> <br/...|$|R

These individuals received not only <b>cardiac</b> rehabilitation <b>health</b> education but exercise training as well. Further, studies performed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and J&J have revealed that organizations that incorporated exercise components into their wellness programs not only decreased healthcare costs by 30% but improved lost work days by 80%. Thus, investing in preventative health practices has proven to not only be more cost effective in resource spending but in improving employee contributions towards high-cost health claims.|$|R
