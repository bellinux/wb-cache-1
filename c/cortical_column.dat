To map submillimeter columnar structures noninvasively, we have evaluated various functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques using a well-established feline orientation column model.

5000|$|Intimately {{related to}} the RUH is the 'protomap' hypothesis, which states that the {{primordial}} identity of each functional area of the cerebral cortex is encoded within the cortical stem cells prior {{to the formation of}} the cortical layers. [...] Within each developing radial unit, the process of neurogenesis gives rise to post-mitotic (non-dividing) cortical neurons, which begin the process of radial neuronal migration from the ventricular zone and adjacent subventricular zone to form the cortical plate in the classic 'inside-out' manner beginning with the deep cortical layers. [...] Once their final destination is achieved, cortical neurons begin to form circuits with other cortical and subcortical neurons, often taking on a columnar shape following the radial migration route.

Between 1995 and 2005, Henry Markram mapped the types of neurons and their connections in such a column. In November 2007, the project reported {{the end of the first}} phase, delivering a data-driven process for creating, validating, and researching the neocortical column. The project seeks to eventually reveal aspects of human cognition and various psychiatric disorders caused by malfunctioning neurons, such as autism, and to understand how pharmacological agents affect network behavior.|$|E

5000|$|The Radial Unit Hypothesis (RUH) is a {{conceptual}} theory of cerebral cortex development, first described by Pasko Rakic. The RUH {{states that the}} cerebral cortex develops during embryogenesis as an array of interacting <b>cortical</b> <b>columns,</b> or 'radial units', each of which originates from a transient stem cell layer called the ventricular zone, which contains neural stem cells known as radial glial cells. [...] The reiterative nature of the cerebral cortex, {{in the sense that}} it is a vast array of repeating functional circuits, led to the idea that cortical evolution is governed by mechanisms regulating the addition of <b>cortical</b> <b>columns,</b> enabling additional functional areas to become specialized and incorporated into the brain. The addition of new radial units is thought to depend on control of the cell cycle (proliferation) of cortical stem cells lining the ventricular system in the ventricular zone and subventricular zone.|$|R
30|$|Cortical {{activity}} displays {{highly complex}} behaviors {{which are often}} characterized {{by the presence of}} noise. Reliable responses to specific stimuli often arise at the level of population assemblies (cortical areas or <b>cortical</b> <b>columns)</b> featuring {{a very large number of}} neuronal cells, each of these presenting a highly nonlinear behavior, that are interconnected in a very intricate fashion. Understanding the global behavior of large-scale neural assemblies has been a great endeavor in the past decades. One of the main interests of large-scale modeling is characterizing brain functions, which most imaging techniques are recording. Moreover, anatomical data recorded in the cortex reveal the existence of structures, such as the <b>cortical</b> <b>columns,</b> with a diameter of about 50 μm to 1 mm, containing the order of 100 to 100, 000 neurons belonging to a few different types. These columns have specific functions; for example, in the human visual area V 1, they respond to preferential orientations of bar-shaped visual stimuli. In this case, information processing does not occur at the scale of individual neurons but rather corresponds to an activity integrating the individual dynamics of many interacting neurons and resulting in a mesoscopic signal arising through averaging effects, and this effectively depends on a few effective control parameters. This vision, inherited from statistical physics, requires that the space scale be large enough to include sufficiently many neurons and small enough so that the region considered is homogeneous. This is, in effect, the case of the <b>cortical</b> <b>columns.</b>|$|R
