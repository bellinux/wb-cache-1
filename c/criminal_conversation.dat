40|$|This short essay, {{part of the}} <b>Criminal</b> Law <b>Conversations</b> project, {{argues for}} an {{objective}} formulation of justification defenses, in which an actor’s conduct is justified if it adheres to the objective rule of conduct that {{we want people to}} follow in the future. That is, it argues that justification defenses serve an essential function in announcing the rules of conduct ex ante to state the authorized exceptions to the law’s prohibitions. The essay is critical of a subjective formulation of justification defenses, in which an actor is said to be “justified” if she reasonably believes she is justified even if her conduct is not something we would want others to do in the future. The objective formulation is preferable both because it serves better to define ex ante the criminal law’s rule of conduct, including the exceptions to its prohibitions, and because it produces the correct liability results with regard to the unknowingly justified actor and those who resist and assist him.

40|$|In the US, {{the words}} ‘telephone surveillance’ {{bring to mind}} {{contemporary}} security concerns about smart phone tracking, the NSA warrantless wiretapping scandal, and the telecommunications provisions of the Patriot Act. Yet telephone surveillance {{is as old as}} telephony itself, dating back to the nearly simultaneous commercialization of the telephone and phonograph in 1878. First put to use by users, so they would have a written record of business meetings held over the phone, recorders were later put to use by police for surreptitious recording of <b>criminal</b> suspects’ <b>conversations.</b> This article examines telephone surveillance by American law enforcement agencies from the inception of telephone service to the passage of the Federal Wiretap Law in 1968, focusing on the challenges an advancing, proliferating, and shrinking technology posed for Fourth Amendment law. To highlight the technological, institutional and cultural interactions that have shaped Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the article deploys Jack Balkin’s theory of cultural software and Anslem Strauss’s concept of a negotiated order, and brings together major cases, federal legislation, and evidence of government surveillance. The article shows how telephone surveillance brought the Fourth Amendment into prominence and inspired many of its most contentious debates; the article argues that during the first 90 years of telephone usage in America, laws on search and seizure developed not from constitutional consistency or logic, but {{as the result of a}} complex negotiation process involving new media and human agency...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavioral}} sciences increasingly {{call into question}} the assumption of criminal law 2 ̆ 7 s ex ante influence on conduct. Potential offenders commonly do not know the legal rules, either directly or indirectly, even those rules that have been explicitly formulated to produce a behavioral effect. Even if they know the rules, the cost-benefit analysis potential offenders perceive [...] which is the only cost-benefit analysis that matters [...] commonly leads to a conclusion suggesting violation rather than compliance, either because the perceived likelihood of punishment is so small, or because it is so distant as to be highly discounted, or for a variety of other or a combination of reasons. And, even if they know the legal rules and perceive a cost-benefit analysis that urges compliance, potential offenders commonly cannot or will not bring such knowledge to bear to guide their conduct in their own best interests, such failure stemming from a variety of social, situational, or chemical influences. Even if no one of these three hurdles is fatal to law 2 ̆ 7 s behavioral influence, their cumulative effect typically is. There seems little doubt that having a criminal justice system that punishes violators, as every organized society has, does have a general effect in influencing the conduct of potential offenders. What seems unlikely is that the manipulation of criminal law rules will alter people 2 ̆ 7 s conduct, given the common lack of the needed prerequisites to a deterrent effect noted above. But even if such conditions did exist, there are still good reasons not to adopt deterrence as a distributive principle for criminal liability and punishment. First, dynamics of deterrent effect are complex and we at present have neither the information nor the understanding needed to reliably predict what effect will come from a given doctrinal manipulation. Further, every distribution of punishment will produce some deterrent effect, even a just deserts distribution, for example. Deterrence as a distributive principle can only do a better job than a desert distribution where it deviates from desert – that is, where it does injustice and fails to do justice [...] yet it is just these cases of deviation from desert in which deterrence works most poorly and has its greatest crimogenic effect.

Theophilus confined his wife to a house in Wild Court, Great Wild Street, from where she was rescued by her brother Thomas who broke in and knocked out the guard.

Sloper's defence counsel rebutted by calling the Kensington housekeeper, Anne Hopson, who testified that Cibber received money from Sloper with full knowledge of his wife's affair. The defence said of Cibber: [...] "He takes his money, lets him maintain his family, resigns his wife to him, and then comes to court for justice, for reparation in damages." [...] Counsel concluded that [...] "there is no denomination in coin small enough to give in damages." [...] The jury concurred, and awarded Cibber a nominal £10.|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been assumed that the goals of doing justice and {{fighting}} crime necessarily conflict. Retributivists and utilitarian crime-control advocates commonly see their dispute as irreconcilable, {{and in a sense}} it is. It is argued here, however, that in another sense these two fundamental aims of criminal justice may not conflict. Doing justice may be the most effective means of fighting crime. The extent of the criminal law 2 ̆ 7 s effectiveness in avoiding resistance and subversion of an unjust system, in bringing the power of stigmatization to bear, in facilitating, communicating, and maintaining societal consensus on what is and is not condemnable, and in gaining compliance in borderline cases through deference to its moral authority is to a great extent dependent on {{the degree to which the}} criminal law has earned moral credibility with the citizens governed by it. Thus, the criminal law 2 ̆ 7 s moral credibility is essential to effective crime control, and is enhanced if the distribution of criminal liability is perceived as 2 ̆ 2 doing justice, 2 ̆ 2 that is, if it assigns liability and punishment in ways that the community perceives as consistent with their shared intuitions of justice. Conversely, the system 2 ̆ 7 s moral credibility, and therefore its crime control effectiveness, is undermined by a distribution of liability that deviates from community perceptions of just desert. The hitch is that it is not moral philosophy 2 ̆ 7 s deontological notion of justice that has crime-control power but rather the community 2 ̆ 7 s notion of justice, what has been called 2 ̆ 2 empirical desert. 2 ̆ 2 This turns out to be both good and bad for constructing a distributive principle for criminal liability and punishment. On the one hand, unlike moral philosophy 2 ̆ 7 s deontological desert, empirical desert can be readily operationalized – its rules and principles can be authoritatively determined through social science research into peoples 2 ̆ 7 shared intuitions of justice. On the other hand, people 2 ̆ 7 s shared intuitions about justice are not justice, in a transcendent sense. People 2 ̆ 7 s shared intuitions can be wrong. In the end, however, the retributivist may find that an instrumentalist distributive principle of empirical desert will produce far more deontological desert than any other workable principle that could or would be adopted.

40|$|This brief essay, {{written for}} the <b>Criminal</b> Law <b>Conversations</b> project, argues that the doctrines of {{provocation}} and self-defense should recognize a distinction between act reasonableness and emotion (or belief) reasonableness. The essay proceeds in three parts. In Part I, I examine the doctrine of provocation. I start by explaining what I mean by “act reasonableness” (a finding that a reasonable person in the defendant’s shoes would have responded or acted as the defendant did) and “emotion reasonableness” (a finding that the defendant’s emotional outrage or passion was reasonable). I note that {{only two of the}} fifty states require act reasonableness while the majority of states require only emotion reasonableness. I explore possible reasons for the reluctance to require act reasonableness. I then offer a different way to understand act reasonableness. Under my suggested reform, the reasonableness of the provoked defendant’s action would depend on the type of force and degree of force he used in relation to the triggering provocation. In other words, act reasonableness would entail a kind of proportionality review. Proportionality, however, would not mean that the provoked defendant would have to respond with force equal to the force used by the provoker. The defendant’s act would just need to be seen by the jury as commensurate with the wrong inflicted by the provoking party. In Part II, I examine the doctrine of self-defense. A similar distinction between emotion reasonableness and act reasonableness exists in the self-defense arena. Even though act reasonableness is implied in self-defense doctrine’s proportionality requirement, jury instructions on self-defense tend to focus only on emotion (or belief) reasonableness. Jurors are instructed to find that the defendant reasonably believed (or reasonably feared) deadly force was necessary to counter an imminent threat of death or grievous bodily injury. Jurors are not instructed to separately find that the defendant’s act of shooting or stabbing or beating the victim was reasonable. I argue that self-defense doctrine should make explicit that which is implicit. Jurors should be instructed to find not only that the defendant reasonably believed deadly force was necessary to counter an imminent threat of death or grievous bodily injury, but also that the defendant’s acts were reasonably proportionate to the threatened harm. In Part III, I conclude that my proposal for reform of the doctrine of self-defense is not a radical reform. My proposal with regard to self-defense merely makes explicit that which is implicit. In contrast, my proposal for reform of provocation doctrine constitutes a substantial departure from current practice in most jurisdictions. I argue that this departure is worthwhile because the provoked killer has taken a human life and therefore deserves heightened scrutiny of the reasonableness of his actions...|$|R
