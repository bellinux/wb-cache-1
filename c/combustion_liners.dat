40|$|In this fuel {{flexible}} turbine system (FFTS) program, the Parker gasification {{system was}} further optimized, fuel composition of biomass gasification process was characterized and {{the feasibility of}} running Capstone MicroTurbine(TM) systems with gasification syngas fuels was evaluated. With high hydrogen content, the gaseous fuel from a gasification process of various feed stocks such as switchgrass and corn stover has high reactivity and high flashback propensity when running in the current lean premixed injectors. The research concluded that the existing C 65 microturbine combustion system, which is designed for natural gas, {{is not able to}} burn the high hydrogen content syngas due to insufficient resistance to flashback (undesired flame propagation to upstream within the fuel injector). A comprehensive literature review was conducted on high-hydrogen fuel combustion and its main issues. For Capstone?s lean premixed injector, the main mechanisms of flashback were identified to be boundary layer flashback and bulk flow flashback. Since the existing microturbine combustion system is not able to operate on high-hydrogen syngas fuels, new hardware needed to be developed. The new hardware developed and tested included (1) a series of injectors with a reduced propensity for boundary layer flashback and (2) two new <b>combustion</b> <b>liner</b> designs (<b>Combustion</b> <b>Liner</b> Design A and B) that lead to desired primary zone air flow split to meet the overall bulk velocity requirement to mitigate the risk of core flashback inside the injectors. The new injector designs were evaluated in both test apparatus and C 65 /C 200 engines. While some of the new injector designs did not provide satisfactory performance in burning target syngas fuels, particularly in improving resistance to flashback. The combustion system configuration of FFTS- 4 injector and <b>Combustion</b> <b>Liner</b> Design A was found promising to enable the C 65 microturbine system to run on high hydrogen biomass syngas. The FFTS- 4 injector was tested in a C 65 engine operating on 100 % hydrogen and with the redesigned <b>combustion</b> <b>liner</b> - <b>Combustion</b> <b>Liner</b> Design A - installed. The results were promising for the FFTS program as the system was able to burn 100 % hydrogen fuel without flashback while maintaining good combustion performance. While initial results have been demonstrated the feasibility of this program, {{further research is needed to}} determine whether these results will be repeated with FFTS- 4 injectors installed in all injector ports and over a wide range of operating conditions and fuel variations...|$|R

This material class {{has the advantage}} of inherent oxidation resistance and damage tolerance, but limitations in creep resistance exist and should be included in long-term simulations of components. Data for developing a creep simulation model were acquired in creep experiments on material with quasiunidirectional fiber architecture. Besides highly anisotropic creep behavior, a significant dependence of strain rate on fiber orientation was revealed under tensile and compressive loading. Additionally, a potential size effect in compression creep was investigated by regarding different specimen’s aspect ratio. All results were evaluated with respect to stress and temperature dependences for further usage in simulations. An approach according to Hill, describing anisotropic creep, was taken as basis and modified by an own subroutine to overcome drawbacks. Hill’s model - as available in common finite element software – does not distinguish tensile from compressive creep. The new subroutine allows for a compression to tension change in stress, as well as the development of creep anisotropy caused by cumulative strain. Experimental results from tension and compression as well as from four-point bending tests were used for input and validation of the simulation...|$|E
40|$|All-oxide Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC), due {{to their}} damage {{tolerance}} and thermal stability, are promising candidates for high temperature applications, including <b>combustion</b> <b>liners</b> and thermal protection systems in aerospace. In these applications, mechanical loads are introduced at high temperatures up to 1200 °C or even higher, which results in complex deformation behavior. For understanding the complex behavior of an all oxide CMC under such extreme environments, laboratory tests and numerical simulations have been performed. The material investigated in this study comprises Nextel R 610 alumina fiber bundles and a porous α alumina matrix, and the composite has been produced by a computer controlled winding process. Analytical and numerical work has been performed for developing a constitutive law describing the observed creep behavior of specimens with unidirectional fiber orientation under compressive load. While for fiber orientations parallel to the compressive load a model with isochoric matrix behavior captured the experimental results well, discrepancies occurred for other fiber orientations. Parameter studies indicated that depending on fiber orientation and matrix properties the composite deformation {{is due to a}} combination of matrix compaction and fiber rotation. In-situ synchrotron studies at Argonne National Laboratory's Advanced Photon Source have been conducted on unidirectional fibre reinforced CMC specimens at 1200 °C while stepwise increasing compressive mechanical load. For investigating the local strain in the composite, diffraction measurements were conducted under representative loading, and transmission radiography was utilized to study the evolution of matrix deformation and fiber rotation. First results indicate that the strain in the fiber and matrix grains of the all alumina composites may be isolated during analysis, providing information on load transfer between fiber and matrix and on elastic and creep behavior of the composite.

40|$|Next-generation, regeneratively cooled rocket engines require {{materials}} that can meet high temperatures while resisting the corrosive oxidation-reduction reaction of combustion known as blanching, {{the main cause}} of engine failure. A project was initiated at NASA-Marshal Space Flight Center (MSFC) to combine three existing technologies to build and demonstrate an advanced liquid rocket engine combustion chamber that would provide a 100 mission life. Technology developed in microgravity research to build cartridges for space furnaces was utilized to vacuum plasma spray (VPS) a functional gradient coating on the hot wall of the <b>combustion</b> <b>liner</b> as one continuous operation, eliminating any bondline between the coating and the liner. The coating was NiCrAlY, developed previously as durable protective coatings on space shuttle high pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP) turbine blades. A thermal model showed that 0. 03 in. NiCrAlY applied to the hot wall of the <b>combustion</b> <b>liner</b> would reduce the hot wall temperature 200 F, a 20 % reduction, for longer life. Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb alloy, which was developed by NASA-Glenn Research Center (GRC), and which possesses excellent high temperature strength, creep resistance, and low cycle fatigue behavior combined with exceptional thermal stability, was utilized as the liner material in place of NARloy-Z.

Recent improvements in Solar`s dry low NOx combustion technology guarantee less than 25 ppmvd NOx and 50 ppmvd CO (@ 15 % O{sub 2 }) in field units. It is expected that with the incorporation of advanced combustion technology (e. g. variable geometry, use of ceramics in <b>combustion</b> <b>liners,</b> improved CO sensor based control systems, improved fuel-air premixing, advanced liner cooling, etc.) into present combustion systems, substantial reductions in emissions over currently guaranteed levels will be possible.

The sub-elements consist of combustion dynamics, stress and modal analysis, fracture mechanics and structural health monitoring have been interlinked indicating the damage evaluation to life assessment. The interaction between the interrelated combustion driven flame dynamics, acoustic pressure fluctuations and liner wall vibration has been investigated in the laboratory combustor test system. During the operation, the combustion, acoustics and wall vibrations have been coupled together. The dynamic combustion process generates high amplitude pressure oscillations resulting in vibration of the liner structure at about constant elevated temperature in base load operation. The thermo-acoustic instabilities have a significant destructive impact {{on the life of}} the liner material due to high cyclic vibration levels at high temperature. A structural health monitoring (SHM) method has been established to identify the damage, detect the flaw existence and determine the location, severity and progress of the damage for the <b>combustion</b> <b>liners.</b> Vibration-based and acoustic emission (AE) techniques have been applied in the test system to assess the structural behavior. The applicability of the technique has been tested by examining the dynamic modal parameters of the structure. The method enables a reliable assessment on the liner specimen at elevated temperatures by means of non-destructive evaluation under continuous operation of the combustor. The combustion liner specimen material has been assessed by calculating the near-tip fields at the crack tip by finite element based stress and fracture mechanics analysis. An algorithm based on J-Integral has been utilized to analyze the crack growth behavior under various loading conditions considering both linear and non-linear elastic fracture mechanics concepts.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} tensile {{properties}} of Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb material produced by VPS to material previously produced by extrusion. The microstructure of the VPS material is also presented. The combustion chamber liner of rocket motors represents an extreme materials application. The liner hot wall {{is exposed to}} a 2760 C (5000 F) flame while the cold side is exposed to cryogenic hydrogen liquid. Materials {{for use in the}} combustion chamber liner require a combination of high temperature strength, creep resistance, and low cycle fatigue resistance along with high thermal conductivity. The hot side is also subject to localized cycles between reducing and oxidizing environments that degrade the liner by a process called blanching. A new Cu- 8 at. % Cr- 4 at% Nb (Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb) alloy has been developed at NASA Lewis Research Center as a replacement for the currently used alloy, NARloy-z (Cu- 3 wt. % Ag- 0. 5 wt. % Zr). The alloy is strengthened by a fine dispersion of Cr 2 Nb particles. The alloy has better mechanical properties than NARloy-Z while retaining most of the thermal conductivity of pure copper. The alloy has been successfully consolidated by extrusion and hot isostatic pressing (HIPing). However, vacuum plasma spraying (VPS) offers several advantages over prior consolidation methods. VPS can produce a near net shape piece with the profile of the liner. In addition, oxidation resistant and thermal barrier coatings can be incorporated {{as an integral part of}} the liner hot wall during the VPS deposition. The low oxygen VPS Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb exhibits a higher strength than Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb produced by extrusion at elevated temperatures and a comparable strength at room temperature.

However, the ability to produce parts to near-net shape and maintain the good elevated temperature tensile properties of the extruded Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb makes VPS an attractive processing method for fabricating rocket engine <b>combustion</b> <b>liners...</b>|$|E

For instance, NARloy-Z containing 40 vol. percent diamond particles, sintered at 975 C to full density by using the Field assisted Sintering Technology (FAST) showed 69 percent higher thermal conductivity than baseline NARloy-Z. Furthermore, NARloy-Z- 40 vol. percent D is 30 percent lighter than NARloy-Z and hence the density normalized thermal conductivity is 140 percent better. These attributes will improve the performance and life of the advanced rocket engines significantly. By one estimate, increased thermal conductivity will directly translate into increased turbopump power up to 2 X and increased chamber pressure for improved thrust and ISP, resulting in an expected 20 percent improvement in engine performance.

Anticipated materials related benefits include decreasing the thrust cell liner weight 5 % to 20 %, increasing the service life at least two fold over current combustion chamber design, and increasing the safety margins available to designers. By adding an oxidation and thermal barrier coating to the <b>liner,</b> the <b>combustion</b> chamber can operate at even higher temperatures. For all these benefits, however, this alloy cannot be formed using conventional casting and forging methods because of the levels of chromium and niobium, which exceed their solubility limit in copper.

These applications encompass thermal barrier coatings which are thermal shock resistant for turbopump blades and nozzles; bond coatings for cryogenic titanium components; wear resistant coatings and materials; high conductivity copper, NaRloy-Z, <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>liners,</b> and structural nickel base material, Inconel 718, for nozzle and combustion chamber support jackets...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of analytical techniques and numerical methods for {{the prediction of}} the stability behavior of liquid propellant rocket combustors is discussed. The studies involved nonlinear wave propagation effects and nonlinear <b>combustion</b> zone, <b>liner,</b> and nozzle responses. A second primary extension of the basic theory was directed at {{the inclusion of the}} effects of injector face baffles. Attention was restricted to the linear (small amplitude) problem, finite Mach numbers, three dimensional oscillations, and distributed combustion effects...|$|R
40|$|Large {{numbers of}} cracks formed at {{stress-relieving}} holes of louvers and probably {{were caused by}} thermal and mechanical fatigue of the flaps. Surface and subsurface scale was extensive. Resistance to failure by cracking was appreciably increased by removing stress relievers from stress-relieving holes. An investigation was conducted to determine what factors contribute to failures in Inconel <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>liners</b> used in two types of turbojet engine. Studies were made of "as-fabricated," heat-treated, and mechanically finished liners, on liners after service operation, and on liners after accelerated engine runs. NACA TN No. 1938. "October 1949.

40|$|The <b>combustion</b> chamber <b>liner</b> of {{the space}} shuttle main engine is made of NARloy-Z, a copper-silver-zirconium alloy. This alloy was {{produced}} by vacuum melting and vacuum centrifugal casting; a production method that is currently now available. Using conventional melting, casting, and forging methods, NASA has produced an alloy of the same composition called NASA-Z. This report compares the composition, microstructure, tensile properties, low-cycle fatigue life, and hot-firing life of these two materials. The results show that the materials have similar characteristics...|$|R
