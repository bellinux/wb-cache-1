500|$|The result {{marked the}} first time that Manchester United had lost in the {{calendar}} year, ending a 33-match unbeaten run. Wenger believed the result showed that Arsenal were [...] "ready for the season", albeit admitting that the defence had trouble coping with Yorke. He thought it was [...] "...psychologically important to beat United, especially after the great run they have had". Wenger confirmed afterwards that Anelka would sign for Real Madrid: [...] "I hope everything will be finalised {{in the next couple of}} days. In any case, he is not <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> and although the contract is not signed yet, I hope it will be after his medical and that is the end of it." [...] Kanu, who scored Arsenal's equaliser and set up the match winner, was pleased with his performance and relished the opportunity of establishing himself in the first team, after Anelka's departure.|$|E
2500|$|In one post, Clarett {{summed up}} his {{attitude}} towards prison by saying [...] "Understand my struggle {{so you can}} respect my hustle. I am never <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> believe that. Never, I am cool on this. It is first-class living from the day I get out. I WILL NEVER SETTLE FOR LESS, EVER AGAIN. That goes for communication, personal relationships, housing, education, friendships, and travel arrangements. Everything. I have the fire in my eyes" ...|$|E

And there am I, walking alone and deeply sad, thinking {{of those who were}} going home and of those who would in their turn be <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>here.</b> In the distance a solemn bell begins to toll, softly; it seems to speak to people of the misery of all those who could neither go home nor come back.' ...|$|E
50|$|The Passacaglia {{movement}} bears {{similarities to}} the first movement both in its use of ostinato and in its expressive arch, slowly building to a climax and then slowly <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> down. <b>Here,</b> however, the ostinato is reduced to simple repeated eighth notes, sounded forcefully by the low strings.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And what's more, Tom,' said John Westlock, seating himself upon {{a pile of}} books, {{and looking}} up at his {{astonished}} friend, 'he is evidently not <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> again; so <b>here</b> you are, installed. Under rather singular circumstances, Tom!' ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{title of}} the album is derived from a lyric from {{the bridge of the}} song [...] "Don't Stop". Taggart {{described}} the rationale behind choosing that title. [...] "'Don’t Stop' {{was one of the last}} songs we recorded, and that one kinda summed up all the stuff we had gone through. Raine had just gotten back from Sudan, he was trying to compress all the things he’d experienced. The shock was going there and then <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> and realizing they have happiness and hope with no material possessions, they live in mud huts. But they have what we want emotionally, you know." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Braves {{earned their}} fourth win {{of the season}} against former Braves pitcher Alex Wood and the Los Angeles Dodgers in a {{lopsided}} 8–1 game at Turner Field. Wood said after the game that it [...] "was not really the way I pictured <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> for the first time. Fastball command was the most frustrating thing. I don't even know if I've walked in a run before in my professional career. The walks were pretty frustrating. It was a tough one to swallow, but I have another one in five days." [...] Despite a 3-1 lead, the Dodgers scored four unanswered runs to snap the Braves four-game win streak. A Yasmani Grandal double in the 10th inning gave the Dodgers a 2–1 victory in the Braves's fourth extra-inning game of the season.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2006 U.S. Open, {{played on}} the West course of the Winged Foot Golf Club, Montgomerie had yet another chance to win his first major championship. He {{stood in the middle}} of the 18th fairway in the final round having sunk a 50-foot birdie putt on the 17th green, which put him in the joint lead with Phil Mickelson. While waiting in {{position}} on the 18th fairway for the group in front to finish, Montgomerie switched his club from a 6-iron to a 7-iron, assuming adrenaline would kick in. Once the wait was over, he hit the approach shot poorly, ending up short and right of the green, in thick rough. He pitched onto the green, and then three-putted from 30 feet to lose the tournament by one stroke. After the loss, Montgomerie said, [...] "At my age I've got to think positively. I'm 43 next week, and it's nice I can come back to this tournament and do well again, and I look forward to <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>here</b> again next year and trying another U.S. Open disaster." [...] Geoff Ogilvy won the championship.|$|E
6000|$|Next morning, {{the brother}} and sister slipped quietly away, and the {{children}} hurried to school, eager to tell the great news that [...] "Miss Celia and Thorny had gone to be married, and were <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> to live <b>here</b> for ever and ever." ...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{factor that}} damaged {{wetlands}} was large scale logging, particularly the extensive logging of cypress {{forests in the}} early 1900s. [...] One early logger described it this way: [...] "We just use the old method of going in and cutting down the swamp and tearing it up and bringing the cypress out. When a man's in here with all the heavy equipment, {{he might as well}} cut everything he can make a board foot out of; we're not ever <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> in <b>here</b> again" [...] This logging often required construction of canals, which, once the logging was finished, allowed salt water to enter the wetlands and prevent regeneration of the cypress.|$|R

50|$|In June 1935, under William Goldin, {{he himself}} became a rezident in London. His cover in London, as Goldin, {{was as a}} {{director}} of an American refrigerator company. He {{had nothing to do}} with the recruitment of Kim Philby or any other member of the Cambridge Five and deserted his post in October 1935, <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> to Moscow. <b>Here</b> he was dismissed from the Foreign Service and put into a lowly position of deputy chief of the Transport Department (TO) of the NKVD, the successor secret service organization of the OGPU.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{congratulate you}}, my dear Fergus, congratulate you {{with all my}} heart; {{and if there is}} just a shadow of regret that you should not have married and settled here entirely, it is but a small regret, in {{proportion}} to the pleasure I feel. It is not even reasonable, for when I consented to your going abroad to take service in Prussia, I knew that this would probably end in your settling down there altogether; for it was hardly likely that you could win a fortune that would admit of your <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> to live <b>here.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes. I {{was only}} waiting for Davidson. Yes, I was <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> <b>here,</b> to these ruins--to Wang, who perhaps {{did not expect}} to see me again. It's {{impossible}} to guess at the way that Chinaman draws his conclusions, and how he looks upon one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tut! tut!" [...] {{returned}} Sir Philip, [...] "he {{might as}} well have come home first, and yet I do not know but that it is the best thing he could do. There might have been difficulties in the way of getting out again, you see, my lady, as things stand now. Ay! ay! you are in the right of it, my boy. It is just as well to let things settle themselves down here before committing himself to one side or the other. 'Tis easy enough for an old fellow like me who has to let nothing go but his Commission of the Peace, but not the same for a stirring young lad; and he is altogether right as to not <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> to idle <b>here</b> as a rich man. It would be the ruin of him. I am glad he has the sense to see it. I was casting about to obtain an estate for him to give him occupation." ...|$|R
50|$|Dietrich then {{returned}} home to Germany {{for a while before}} <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> to Paris. <b>Here</b> he began his lectures on Sentences in 1281 (Pasnau 2010). Exactly how long Dietrich remained in Paris in not clear, but it is agreed that he was made the prior of the Dominican convent in Wurzburg around 1293 (Fuhrer 1992). Further sources indicate that he was appointed provincial of Teutonia in 1293 as well (SOMERSET, FIONA 1998). Dietrich was then “promoted”, to the Provincial Superior for the province of Germany, the position previously held by Albert the Great (Pasnau 2010, Fuhrer 1992). Around the years of 1296 and 1297 he was named “master of theology’ in Paris, where he taught up to around 1300 (Teske 2008). Dietrich was also present for the general chapter of the Dominican order at Toulouse and his name appears in the general chapter of the order in Piacenza. The last position Dietrich was appointed to was Vicar provincial of Germany in 1310 (Gillispie 2008). Dietrich’s name does not appear in any kind of document after this time.|$|R

[...] "But if he expects me to gush over his <b>coming</b> <b>back,</b> he's fooled, that's all. He's left us to paddle our own canoe all this while, and, {{so far as}} I'm concerned, he can leave us alone hereafter.
