40|$|The Instant Messaging (IM) {{application}} {{is one of}} the most widely used communication methods in the world. It is used by a wide range of age groups and backgrounds. Its extensive use in everyday life provides unique opportunities but means that it can also be used to commit crime such as cyber bullying or by becoming a medium for criminals’ communication. It can, however, also be used by forensic investigators to profile the users behavior. This makes it essential for forensics researchers to study artifacts left by such applications. This paper studies the artifacts left by one such popular application -LINE. The aim of this paper is to provide a road map for forensic investigators when dealing with LINE IM application artifacts. The artifacts are discussed in two parts: the first examines regular <b>chatting</b> <b>mode</b> and the second, private chatting. QC 20160930 </p...|$|R

5000|$|Each game server {{offered a}} {{particular}} type of chat—the majority allowing either <b>chat</b> <b>mode,</b> but some servers allowed only the [...] "Ultimate Safe Chat" [...] mode. When using [...] "Standard Safe Chat", all comments made by users were filtered. When a comment was blocked, the user who made the comment saw it, but other users were unaware that it was made—suggesting to the [...] "speaker" [...] that they were being ignored, rather than encouraging them {{to try to find a}} way around the restriction.|$|E
50|$|The game {{is divided}} into servers, or game worlds, {{each with its own}} unique name and set of further subdivisions - channels. While players from {{different}} servers cannot interact with each other unless they transfer to the same server using special premium items, they can switch freely through all available channels on one server, including Premium ones if they have purchased a Premium package. Characters in different channels cannot, however, assist each other directly; only characters in the same channel can interact. Chatting does bypass this restriction for <b>chat</b> <b>modes</b> such as private messaging (whispering), guild chat, party chat or personal chat rooms. All servers in each localization have equal content, apart from their player base and economy. However, different regional versions of Cabal Online may have different content, in particular the Korean localization, which is always more up-to-date than the remainder. Each account allows for six characters per server, but only one account is needed to access all servers.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about a novel form of online visual {{expression}} that I call “pixel patchwork. ” 1 Instead of typing words as is usual in verbal chat, participants in certain “channels ” or chatrooms on IRC (Internet Relay Chat), one of the world’s most popular online <b>chat</b> <b>modes,</b> interact primarily via the display of brilliantly colored images created with letters and other typographic symbols on the computer keyboard. Text-based images have been featured {{on a number of}} IRC channels since 1996 - 7, but have particularly flourished on #mirc_rainbow, rainbow for short, a channel on the Undernet, a major network of IRC servers. 2 “ mIRC ” is the Windows-based program players use to communicate and display images. 3 Participants engage in everyday, spontaneous communication via images, and also hold scheduled events such as art shows, channel anniversary celebrations, and birthday parties, again primarily featuring images rather than words. Borrowing a term from world music, I call this art “avant-folk, ” because it strikingly juxtaposes considerable skill using computers 4 with naïve, group-based artistic expression resembling traditional folk art in important respects, despit...|$|R
40|$|World Health Organization (WHO) {{estimates}} that African Region has a shortfall of 817, 992 health workers. Sub-Saharan Africa faces {{the greatest challenges}} with 11 % of the world’s population and 24 % of the global burden of diseases; the region has only 3 % of the world’s health workers commanding less than 1 % of world health expenditure. The ratio of available facilities to the teeming population is also grossly inadequate. These are among the major reasons why computer (Information Technology (IT)) has been employed {{over the years to}} help in different areas of health care- diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and medical records. It is very obvious that most of these computer based health management systems lack among other things the real time live interaction between health practitioners and patients. Mobile applications are now increasingly popular, though used mostly for instant messaging and social networking. In this paper we have proposed the use of mobile application to improve health care delivery system in Nigeria with real-time live <b>chatting</b> <b>mode</b> similar to the instant social chatting where diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of patients can be done through mobile technology. While readers’ attention was drawn to this, a framework of the proposed system was developed for health practitioners and researchers to look into so as to move Nigeria and other developing countries in African forward in the health secto...|$|R

As time passed, a host mode was written into the application which allowed the user to accept incoming data calls. Before the release of version 13.00 (released Autumn, 1987), the host mode portion of the application had been expanded to become a full-blown BBS host application, complete with message and file areas, file uploading and downloading, the capability to host BBS door programs, and a sysop-to-user <b>chat</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Commodore-64 was {{a simple}} computer, based on the MOS Technology 6502 8-bit microprocessor, with 64 {{kilobytes}} of RAM, only 38k of which was available for program code and variables {{that could be used}} by the built-in BASIC programming language interpreter. Nevertheless, several different BBS programs were developed (including DS2) by various independent programmers (mostly hobbyists not affiliated with any large software publisher) that enabled a System Operator (SysOp) to run a single-user, multiple member online community supporting threaded topical discussions, on-line games; information reference library, live <b>chat</b> <b>mode</b> with the console operator, file-sharing library and the ability to create a customized user experience in BASIC, thus the Developers System title.|$|E

40|$|Most {{attention}} {{these days}} of digital communication encompasses wideband techniques. However new small band techniques are generating new and unique applications. Only a few watts of RF energy are needed to accomplish worldwide communications. Many of the small band modes allow to use signals buried in noise. Using these techniques, for example EME (Earth-Moon-Earth) communications can be performed much easier. Hardware and RF power are minimised. Digital modem techniques using DSP are maximally used. PSK 31 allows real time <b>chat</b> <b>modes</b> but even pictures can be sent. Long distance communication and controlled systems with mobile equipment are now much easier and opens new possibilities for example in long distance, network independent and security applications. The aim of this work is to study these small band modes and look into the boundaries of feasible applications. A controlled digital link {{has been set up}} using mainly PSK 31. Under these controlled conditions, phenomena such as noise, interference, Doppler effects, SNR, IMD and BER are studied and measured. The transceivers also can be used on antenna and work on 14 MHz, a frequency where many users can be found. This facilitates real life experiments. One of the big problems when faced with slow modes is the lack of dedicated instrumentation. Much practical information on small band modes is available from radio amateurs, but there is little technical documentation. PSK 31 is quickly becoming one of the favourite communication modes...|$|R

40|$|Note: {{this version}} of the paper does not include the {{accompanying}} slide show. If readers are interested, I will send them the. ppt file of the slideshow as an email attachment. Since May 1997 I have been studying a new form of digital art on IRC, or Internet Relay Chat. This art is a form of grassroots online artistic expression by newly computer-literate people having little or no formal training in art and only moderate education. It is a form of text-based art, an elaboration of “ASCII art. ” Images are created from letters and typographic symbols. ASCII art employs only the typographic characters available in “plain text”, and has been with us since the 1960 s and 1970 s. IRC is ordinarily a textual, typed <b>chat</b> <b>mode.</b> A program called “mIRC, ” which can be used in Windows 95 and up, makes it possible to color images in any of 16 different colors, and to incorporate exotic typographic symbols, extended ASCII characters, as in the lower example in this slide. Images may be eithe...|$|E
40|$|This paperproposes {{a web-based}} online voice chat robot, which {{supports}} speech recognition, speech synthesis, artificial intelligence and motion response with a 3 D avatar. There {{are a lot}} of online chat robots which are based on Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML), however, they usually only support text <b>chat</b> <b>mode.</b> Recently, a voice toolkit called MMDAgent is developed by Nagoya Institute of Technology, Japan, which supports speech recognition, synthesis and a 3 D agent. However, the brain of MMDAgent is based on script instead of AIML and it could only support Japanese and run on local machine, which is not very convenient and intelligent. Therefore, we developed an online version voice chat robot called MMDAvatar, which also supports speech recognition, speech synthesis, and motion response with a 3 D avatar. Furthermore, it is based on AIML and open to training online. Currently, for the speech recognition, we use the HTML 5 speech recognition tag. The Festival speech synthesis engine is used to synthesize the speech. An AIML engine (program O) is used as the brain of the chat robot and the 3 D avatar is drawn by WebGL. Compared to MMDAgent, with an AIML engine, our chat robot is more flexible. Meanwhile, since it i...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{limitations}} with text <b>chat</b> as a <b>mode</b> {{of writing}} (e. g., a simplified register, short turns), researchers {{have argued that}} it offers unique advantages as a site for language practice. However, realizing these advantages in second language (L 2) writing-to-learn environments may depend on whether tasks are implemented {{in a way that}} facilitates learners’ attention to language form in their writing. It follows that the design and selection of appropriate tasks to use in Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) are key issues. Inspired by the Cognition Hypothesis (Robinson, 2005), the current study examined the role of two instructional interventions related to task implementation—the amount of task structure and inclusion of language support—in promoting accurate and complex writing via text chat by L 2 learners in a classroom setting. Data were collected from 96 students performing an engineering simulation task via text chat. The learners were placed in one of four counterbalanced experimental groups. Analysis of the chat exchanges provided evidence that task complexity influenced the accuracy of student writing in line with the Cognition Hypothesis. However, the influence of task complexity on the linguistic complexity of their writing failed to match predictions of the Cognition Hypothesi...|$|R
