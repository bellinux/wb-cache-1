40|$|AbstractThe triphenylbismuth diacetate reacted {{selectively}} {{with different}} aminoindazole derivatives in presence of <b>copper</b> <b>diacetate</b> to engender {{a new series}} of mono phenyl aminoindazole compounds in good to high yields. Moreover, the same reagent with 4 -chloro- 2 -methyl- 2 H-indazol- 7 -amine led to a mixture of mono- and N,N-diphenylaminoindazoles. However, its combination with 2 H-indazol- 4 -amine provided only one N, 1 -diphenylaminoindazole compound...|$|E
