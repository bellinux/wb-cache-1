50|$|The <b>catenary</b> <b>{{suspension}}</b> {{bridge of}} Real Ferdinando sul Garigliano or the Bridge of Real Ferdinando over the River Garigliano {{was the first}} iron suspension bridge built in Italy, {{and one of the}} earliest in continental Europe. This bridge, which was technologically advanced for its age, was built in 1832 by the Bourbon Kingdom of Two Sicilies The engineer who designed the bridge was Luigi Giura.|$|E

The building is {{directly over the}} top of Liverpool Street Station, a high traffic railroad station. But the rail station could not be touched so no supporting column could touch the ground. To solve this problem three different structural systems were used to support the 10 story tall building over the 78 meter clear span. These were an X-braced truss system, a 10 story <b>catenary</b> <b>suspension</b> system, and a parabolic arch system. It is basically a building-bridge hybrid.|$|E

The force of lining structure is studied using numerical simulation based on the research and analysis of relevant theory and model test results. Firstly, the variation of the air pressure in the tunnel was calculated caused by the train when it is passing through the tunnel at different speeds (200 ~ 400 km/h). Then, by ANSYS the aerodynamic load calculated by FLUENT {{is applied to the}} simplified <b>catenary</b> <b>suspension.</b> The main results are as follows: 1. The maximum normal stress of tunnel lining with train speed according to the power law, and maximum normal stress with train speed according to quadratic function relation; 2. Tunnel lining is subjected to push-pull stress because the magnitude and direction of aerodynamic loads change with the advance of the train; 3. The lining structure is mainly subjected to the stress of the Y direction, and this stress should not be neglected when design the structure of tunnel secondary lining. 4. The load spectrum of the lining structure under different train speed is given. The research results of this paper are of great significance to the optimization design of tunnel lining structure...|$|E

At that station, the two systems use common overhead <b>catenary</b> poles and <b>suspension</b> wires for about 300 m, but are electrically isolated from each other.|$|R
