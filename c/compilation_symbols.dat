This paper introduces the Fourth Generation Make which embodies major semantic and syntactic enhancements to the standard make program. The enhancements include support for source files distributed among many directories, an efficient shell interface that allows concurrent execution of update commands, dynamic dependency generation, dependencies on conditional <b>compilation</b> <b>symbols</b> and a powerful new meta language for constructing default rules. A complete rewrite of the standard make code {{has resulted in a}} unified software construction program that also provides improved functionality and performance. Improved performance includes an average five to ten times decrease in makfile size and an average two to five times decrease in execution time. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the features and operation of the standard make. ...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to performing semantic analysis {{at this stage}} of <b>compilation,</b> often <b>symbol</b> tables are created in order to assist in code generation.|$|R
50|$|Oberon-2 {{provides}} built-in run-time {{support for}} garbage collection similar to Java and performs bounds and array index checks, etc. that eliminate the potential stack and array bounds overwriting problems and manual memory management issues inherent in C/C++. Separate <b>compilation</b> using <b>symbol</b> files and name-spaces via the module architecture ensure quick rebuilds since only modules with changed interfaces {{need to be}} recompiled.|$|R
5000|$|... (7) Electronic {{signature}} means {{a computer}} data <b>compilation</b> of any <b>symbol</b> or series of symbols executed, adopted, or authorized {{by an individual}} to be the legally binding equivalent of the individual's handwritten signature.|$|R
50|$|To a much {{lesser degree}} this simpler coding, also speeds <b>compilation,</b> as fewer <b>symbols</b> {{need to be}} processed. Once again {{this might not be}} {{important}} for small programs, but for large, long lived programs this amounts to a huge savings in unnecessary bloat.|$|R
40|$|Historically, an {{anatomic}} dental chart is a <b>compilation</b> of color-coded <b>symbols</b> {{and numbers}} used within a template, either paper or computerized, {{to create a}} graphic record of a patient’s oral health status. This poster depicts how Geospatial Information System (GIS) technology {{can be used to}} create an accurate, current anatomic dental chart that contains detailed information not present in current charting systems...|$|R
40|$|Ion Exchange Equilibrium Constants {{focuses on}} the test-compilation of {{equilibrium}} constants for ion exchange reactions. The book first underscores {{the scope of the}} <b>compilation,</b> equilibrium constants, <b>symbols</b> used, and arrangement of the table. The manuscript then presents the table of equilibrium constants, including polystyrene sulfonate cation exchanger, polyacrylate cation exchanger, polymethacrylate cation exchanger, polysterene phosphate cation exchanger, and zirconium phosphate cation exchanger. The text highlights zirconium oxide anion exchanger, zeolite type 13 Y cation exchanger, an...|$|R

The work appeared almost simultaneously with the Lutheran Formula of Concord, and may be called a Reformed Formula of Concord, though differing from the former in being a mere <b>compilation</b> from previous <b>symbols.</b>|$|R
40|$|Children's {{literature}} as a selection and <b>compilation</b> of <b>symbols,</b> words, diagrams and pictures {{is a message}} mechanism that is today multi modal in its delivery. Tschida, Ryan and Ticknor (2014) assert that children's literature is 'one of the primary conduits for sending messages to students' (p. 28). This message delivery system is globally accepted as it is familiar, {{has the potential to}} educate, to entertain, to stimulate and provoke thought; activities all of which have the power to transform children's thinking and actions for the good (Helterbran, 2009). Literature 'reflect[s] {{in one way or another}} ideology and the values of the society in which they are written' (Regev, 1992, p. 33). It is also an 'expedient vehicle through which to contest cultural systems and present marginalised views within a majority form' (Miller, 2014, p. 137). The author and illustrator's deliberate selection of symbols, words, diagrams and pictures assembled into the multiple genres of children's literature, represents a particular values stance. In the examples represented in this article it is a stance associated with global education and global citizenship skills and dispositions. This values stance portrays a cultural language, tradition and identity of a particular group of people, places or things all presented from the author's chosen perspective. It delivers a particular message...|$|R
2500|$|In May 1890 Liubov Gurevich, the {{new head}} of the revamped Severny Vestnik, turned a former narodnik's safe haven into the {{exciting}} club for members of the rising experimental literature scene, labeled [...] "decadent" [...] by detractors. Merezhkovsky's new drama Sylvio was published there, the translation of Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven followed suit. Other journals became interested in the young author too: Russkaya Mysl published his poem Vera (later included in his The <b>Symbols</b> <b>compilation),</b> hailed as one of the Russian Symbolism's early [...] masterpieces, its colourful mysticism providing a healthy antidote to narodniks's [...] "reflections" [...] of the social life. Bryusov [...] "absolutely fell in love with it," [...] and Pyotr Pertsov years later admitted: [...] "For my young mind Merezhkovsky's Vera sounded so much superior to this dull and old-fashioned Pushkin".|$|R
