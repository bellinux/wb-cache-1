5|$|Dialogi and Summa Technologiae (1964) are Lem's {{two most}} famous {{philosophical}} texts. The Summa is notable {{for being a}} unique analysis of prospective social, cybernetic, and biological advances; in this work, Lem discusses philosophical implications of technologies that were <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> the realm of science fiction at the time, but are gaining importance today—for instance, virtual reality and nanotechnology.|$|E

If () is singular in () for any Hilbert space, we say is <b>completely</b> singular <b>in.</b> We prove that if is a singular abelian von Neumann subalgebra or if is a singular subfactor of a type II_ 1 factor, then is <b>completely</b> singular <b>in.</b> For any type II_ 1 factor, we construct a singular von Neumann subalgebra of (≠) such that (l^ 2 (N)) is regular (hence not singular) in (l^ 2 (N)). If is separable, then is <b>completely</b> singular <b>in</b> {{if and only if}} for any θ∈ Aut(') such that θ(X) =X for all X∈', then θ(Y) =Y for all Y∈'. As an application of this characterization of completely singularity, we prove that if is separable (with separable predual) and is <b>completely</b> singular <b>in,</b> then Ł is <b>completely</b> singular <b>in</b> Ł for any separable von Neumann algebra Ł.

5|$|A Sm3 derailed near Karjaa on 25 July 2003 due to {{a defect}} in a turnout. The train derailed at a low speed after {{mechanics}} turned the turnout blades manually into the correct position, but forgot to check the turnout frog, which was set to a diverging track. The first three carriages of the train derailed <b>completely,</b> <b>in</b> addition to the first bogie of the fourth car.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, Bolliger & Mabillard {{has built}} 112 roller {{coasters}} around the world. The Incredible Hulk and Dragon Challenge, both at Universal's Islands of Adventure, were closed in 2015 and 2017 respectively. Hulk was scrapped {{so it could}} be rebuilt <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> 2016 and Dragon Challenge will be dismantled so it can be replaced by an unknown coaster in 2019. Lightning at Kuwait Entertainment City is currently closed due to its park being closed for a refurbishment. Some have been relocated and renamed.|$|E
5|$|By 3:30p.m. the {{massacre}} was well under way. A {{group of women}} in Rock Springs had gathered at the plank bridge, where they stood and cheered on the rampage. Two of the women reportedly fired shots at the Chinese. As the riot wore on into the night, the Chinese miners scattered into the hills, lying in the grass to hide. Between four and nine p.m., rioters {{set fire to the}} camp houses belonging to the coal company. By nine p.m., all but one Chinese camp house was burned <b>completely.</b> <b>In</b> all, 79 Chinese homes were destroyed by fire. Damage to Chinese-owned property was estimated at around $147,000.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{food items}} {{commonly}} consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters {{and should be}} avoided <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> captivity. After they are completely weaned at around 21 days of age, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are lactose intolerant and cannot digest milk. Onions and garlic are very dangerous and can cause severe haemolytic anemia. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, so can have severe laxative effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, fuel {{stocks were}} used by the armies, and were {{unavailable}} to farmers. This allowed horses to remain a key aspect of agriculture and transportation {{until the end of}} the war. After the war, farmers rapidly mechanized their operations. The Auxois and other draft breeds were quickly abandoned in favor of machines, and population numbers began to fall in the early 1950s and collapsed <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> the 1960s. By the 1970s, the Auxois had almost disappeared, although many villages in the breed's homeland retained a small number of mares for traditional competitions.|$|E
5|$|From the 9th century, Nuskhuri script {{starting}} becoming dominant, and {{the role}} of Asomtavruli was reduced. However, epigraphic monuments of the 10th to 18th centuries continued to be written in Asomtavruli script. Asomtavruli in this later period became more decorative. In the majority of 9th-century Georgian manuscripts which were written in Nuskhuri script, Asomtavruli was used for titles and the first letters of chapters. Although, some manuscripts written <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> Asomtavruli can be found until the 11th century.|$|E

5|$|In April 2007, this {{experiment}} was repeated and a further three atoms of copernicium-283 were positively identified. The adsorption property was confirmed {{and indicated that}} copernicium has adsorption properties <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> agreement with being the heaviest member of group 12. These experiments also allowed the first experimental estimation of copernicium's boiling point: 84°C, so {{that it may be}} a gas at standard conditions.|$|E
5|$|In all, Hurricane Mitch caused {{at least}} 3,800 {{fatalities}} in Nicaragua, of {{which more than}} 2,000 {{were killed in the}} towns of El Provenir and Rolando Rodriguez from the landslide at the Casita volcano. The mudslide buried at least four villages <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> several feet of mud. Throughout the entire country, the hurricane left between 500,000 and 800,000 homeless. In all, damage in Nicaragua is estimated at around $1billion (1998USD).|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) {{finalized}} {{plans to}} overhaul the station <b>completely.</b> <b>In</b> 1999, the MTA requested $125 million in federal funding for the renovation. As part of renovation, a group of satellite dishes was proposed for the station. By this point, the New York City Transit Police were operating from a tent adjacent to the station, and there were vestiges of a carousel within the station.|$|E

5|$|Many other binary {{nitrogen}} hydrides are known, but {{the most}} important are hydrazine (N2H4) and hydrogen azide (HN3). Although it is not a nitrogen hydride, hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well. Hydrazine is a fuming, colourless liquid that smells similarly to ammonia. Its physical properties are very similar to those of water (melting point 2.0°C, boiling point 113.5°C, density 1.00g·cm−3). Despite it being an endothermic compound, it is kinetically stable. It burns quickly and <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour. It is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia. It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel.|$|E

5|$|North Parade Bridge {{was built}} almost 100 {{years later in}} 1836 by William Tierney Clark. His {{original}} bridge was made of cast iron on stone abutments, with lodges and staircases. This was rebuilt in 1936 <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> stone. Many of the buildings in South Parade are now hotels and restaurants whilst some remain as private residences. The area which Wood envisaged as an area of sunken gardens matching the houses is now a car park.|$|E
5|$|Panglung Hermitage (spangs lung ri khrod) {{is located}} in the valley, {{northeast}} and downhill from Phur lcog. Panglung lies <b>completely</b> <b>in</b> ruins although it once had a large temple and a Rdo rje shugs ldan oracle; an individual who would go into trance to make prognostications while possessed by the god. Panglung was attempted to be renovated in the 1990s, but met opposition from the local people because the site had always been associated with this controversial protector deity, so redevelopment was prevented.|$|E
5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover <b>completely.</b> <b>In</b> {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of viremia, and inversely proportional to the degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E
