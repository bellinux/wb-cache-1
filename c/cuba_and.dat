5|$|Although {{a secret}} {{agreement}} originally stated that Odlum would take power after six months, {{his support for}} <b>Cuba</b> <b>and</b> similar left-wing nations led to American pressure to keep him out. After months of negotiations, Odlum was dismissed as Deputy Prime Minister, and the ensuing government weakness and infighting led to its defeat in the 1982 election. In opposition, Odlum was made Ambassador to the United Nations, resigning in 1996. When the Labour Party came to power again a year later, he became Foreign Minister, overseeing the establishment of stronger relations with both <b>Cuba</b> <b>and</b> China. Amidst controversy over his alleged alliance with the opposition, Odlum resigned in 2001. Never again returning to power, he died on 28 September 2003 following a battle with pancreatic cancer.|$|E

5|$|March 1957. Guevara {{deals with}} {{debilitating}} bouts of asthma as his group of revolutionaries {{meet up with}} Castro’s. Together, they attack an army barracks in the Sierra Maestra on May 28, 1957. After that, they begin {{to win over the}} rural peasant population of <b>Cuba</b> <b>and</b> receive increasing support, while battling both the government and traitors in their midst. Gradually, however, the government loses control of most of the rural areas. Soon afterward, the July 26th Movement forges alliances with other revolutionary movements in <b>Cuba,</b> <b>and</b> begin to assault towns and villages. Most fall to the rebels with little to no resistance.|$|E

5|$|On November 2, a trough of {{low-pressure}} {{was analyzed}} near the Lesser Antilles. The system moved westward into the Caribbean Sea without much organization. On November 7, the low-pressure area moved south of <b>Cuba</b> <b>and</b> became sufficiently organized {{to be considered}} a tropical depression with a pressure of at least 1010 mbar (hPa; 29.83 inHg). The depression moved over <b>Cuba</b> <b>and</b> into the Atlantic, where it dissipated the following day. On November 9, a second system was detected northeast of Bermuda with a pressure of 1005 mbar (hPa; 29.68 inHg), though it remained unclear whether the two systems were related.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Arlene {{was a rare}} {{off-season}} {{tropical cyclone}} that hit <b>Cuba</b> <b>and</b> the Bahamas in May1981. Its formation was unusual, originating from a tropical disturbance that crossed from the eastern Pacific Ocean into the Caribbean Sea; few Atlantic hurricanes develop in this manner. On May6, a tropical depression developed, {{and the next day}} it became Tropical Storm Arlene near the Cayman Islands, three weeks {{before the start of the}} hurricane season. This marked the first Atlantic tropical storm in May since 1970's Hurricane Alma. Arlene moved northeastward throughout its life, bringing rainfall and locally gusty winds as it crossed <b>Cuba</b> <b>and</b> the southeastern Bahamas. On May9, the storm dissipated when a large non-tropical storm absorbed Arlene. There were no reports of deaths or significant damage.|$|E

5|$|As {{the crisis}} unfolded, {{tensions}} were {{high in the}} U.S.; less so in the Soviet Union, where Khrushchev made several public appearances, {{and went to the}} Bolshoi Theatre to hear American opera singer Jerome Hines, who was then performing in Moscow. By 25 October, with the Soviets unclear about Kennedy's full intentions, Khrushchev decided that the missiles would have to be withdrawn from Cuba. Two days later, he offered Kennedy terms for the withdrawal. Khrushchev agreed to withdraw the missiles in exchange for a U.S. promise not to invade <b>Cuba</b> <b>and</b> a secret promise that the U.S. would withdraw missiles from Turkey, near the Soviet heartland. As the last term was not publicly announced {{at the request of the}} U.S., and was not known until just before Khrushchev's death in 1971, the resolution was seen as a great defeat for the Soviets, and contributed to Khrushchev's fall less than two years later. Castro had urged Khrushchev to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on the U.S. in the event of any invasion of <b>Cuba,</b> <b>and</b> was angered by the outcome, referring to Khrushchev in profane terms.|$|E
