5|$|Despite the obstacles, {{readers and}} {{commentators}} {{have reached a}} broad consensus about the book's central cast of characters and, to a lesser degree, its plot, but key details remain elusive. The book discusses, in an unorthodox fashion, the Earwicker family, comprising the father HCE, the mother ALP, {{and their three children}} Shem the Penman, Shaun the Postman, and Issy. Following an unspecified rumour about HCE, the book, in a nonlinear dream narrative, follows his wife's attempts to exonerate him with a letter, his sons' struggle to replace him, Shaun's rise to prominence, and a final monologue by ALP at the break of dawn. The opening line of the book is a sentence fragment which continues from the book's unfinished <b>closing</b> <b>line,</b> making the work a never-ending cycle. Many noted Joycean scholars such as Samuel Beckett and Donald Phillip Verene link this cyclical structure to Giambattista Vico's seminal text La Scienza Nuova ("The New Science"), upon which they argue Finnegans Wake is structured.|$|E
500|$|Although legend {{persists}} {{that the}} Hays Office fined Selznick $5,000 {{for using the}} word [...] "damn" [...] in Butler's exit line, in fact the Motion Picture Association board passed {{an amendment to the}} Production Code on November 1, 1939, that forbade use of the words [...] "hell" [...] or [...] "damn" [...] except when their use [...] "shall be essential and required for portrayal, in proper historical context, of any scene or dialogue based upon historical fact or folklore ... or a quotation from a literary work, provided that no such use shall be permitted which is intrinsically objectionable or offends good taste." [...] With that amendment, the Production Code Administration had no further objection to Rhett's <b>closing</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, praised several scenes from the episode, {{including}} Homer's dream of winning the lottery, Mr. Burns' brainwashing of Santa's Little Helper, and the <b>closing</b> <b>line</b> of the episode that [...] "No dogs were harmed in the filming of this episode. A cat got sick, and someone shot a duck. But that's it." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict commented that Santa's Little Helper's [...] "twisted stomach means the family must budget themselves {{to pay for the}} surgery, and the results {{are some of the best}} lines in the history of the show. From 'lousy chub night' to 'mmmm, snouts,' the hard knock life seems to enliven Homer into one sarcastic bastard." [...] Mikey Cahill of the Herald Sun named this episode's chalkboard gag, [...] "I saw nothing unusual in the teacher's lounge", the third-best chalkboard gag in the show's history.|$|E

500|$|There are six main {{types of}} song lyrics in Peking opera: emotive, condemnatory, narrative, descriptive, disputive, and [...] "shared space {{separate}} sensations" [...] lyrics. Each type {{uses the same}} basic lyrical structure, differing only in kind and degree of emotions portrayed. Lyrics are written in couplets (lian) consisting of two lines (ju). Couplets can consist of two ten character lines, or two seven character lines. The lines are further subdivided into three dou (lit. [...] "pause"), typically in a 3-3-4 or 2-2-3 pattern. Lines may be [...] "padded" [...] with extra characters {{for the purpose of}} clarifying meaning. Rhyme is an extremely important device in Peking opera, with thirteen identified rhyme categories. [...] Song lyrics also use the speech tones of Mandarin Chinese in ways that are pleasing to the ear and convey proper meaning and emotion. The first and second of Chinese's four tones are normally known as [...] "level" [...] (ping) tones in Peking opera, while the third and fourth are called [...] "oblique" [...] (ze). The <b>closing</b> <b>line</b> of every couplet in a song ends in a level tone.|$|E
500|$|Along with [...] "Brand New Day", [...] "Everyone" [...] and [...] "Glad Tidings" [...] form {{a closing}} trio of songs {{permeated}} by what John Tobler called [...] "a celebratory air, bordering on spiritual joy". Labes opened [...] "Everyone" [...] by playing a clavinet figure in [...] time. A flute comes in, playing the melody after Morrison has sung four lines, with Schroer playing the harmony underneath on soprano saxophone. Although Morrison says {{the song is}} just a song of hope, Hinton says its lyrics suggest a more troubled meaning, as [...] 1969 was {{the year in which}} The Troubles broke out in Belfast. The final track, [...] "Glad Tidings", has a bouncy beat but the lyrics, like [...] "Into the Mystic", remain largely impenetrable, according to Hinton. In his opinion, [...] "the opening line and <b>closing</b> <b>line,</b> 'and they'll lay you down low and easy', could be either about murder or an act of love." [...] In Hage's opinion, [...] "'Glad Tidings' was a premonition of the future, as for the next four decades, Morrison would continue to use a song here and there to vent about the evils of the music industry and the world of celebrity." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} about the {{breakdown}} of a relationship between Beyoncé and her lover, a situation that suits both of them. They also touch on revenge and karma, particularly the opening line, [...] "What goes around comes back around", the lines [...] "Best thing I never had", [...] "Best thing you never had", and the <b>closing</b> <b>line,</b> [...] "Sucks to be you right now". Happy to have avoided heartbreak, Beyoncé continues to sing about her ex-lover, who did not recognize {{the possibility of a}} happy relationship with Beyoncé until the relationship broke down. Beyoncé no longer desires her lover after discovering his deceit; as shown in the pre-chorus and chorus lines, [...] "When I think of the time that I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you / Thank God you blew it, I thank God I dodged a bullet / I’m so over you, so baby good looking out / I wanted you bad / I’m so through with that / Because honestly / You {{turned out to be the}} best thing I never had / And will always be the best thing you never had." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{talks about the}} healing effect of love. In an article for Bustle, Danielle Jackson presumed it to be love from her fans who had {{supported}} Gaga throughout her career. While performing [...] "The Cure" [...] at 'Coachella', the singer said to the crowd: [...] "I love you guys so much. I have {{been through so much}} in my life and I've seen so much. And you cure me every time with your love." [...] The dedication-like lyrics begins with the singer comparing her music as an escape route for her fans. This is expanded upon in the chorus when Gaga belts [...] "If I can't find the cure, I'll, I'll fix you with my love", thus positioning herself as someone who advocates for the troubling time in anyone's life, evident by the <b>closing</b> <b>line</b> [...] "Promise I'll always be there, Promise I'll be the cure". Ally Hirschalg from Mic also found other explanations from the lyrics: a mother talking to her children and someone who had a recent break-up, the latter alluding to Gaga's break-up with fiancee Taylor Kinney the previous year.|$|E
500|$|After taping {{the pilot}} episode for Power of 10, Carey was {{contacted}} by CBS about replacing Bob Barker—who had earlier announced his own retirement—as host of The Price Is Right. After initially turning down the offer, Carey announced on Late Show with David Letterman {{that he would}} succeed Barker as host of the program beginning {{in the fall of}} 2007. His first episode of The Price Is Right was taped on August 15, and his shows began airing on October 15. In response to replacing Barker as host of the game show, Carey stated [...] "You can't replace Bob Barker. I don't compare myself to anybody... It's only about what you're doing and supposed to do, and I feel like I'm supposed to be doing this." [...] When Carey began hosting, the set, theme music, and show logo were updated. However, Carey kept the old <b>closing</b> <b>line</b> about spaying and neutering the pets that originated with Barker, although his version uses slightly different wording. During Carey's second year as host, he began to write some of the sketches used during the Showcase, which sometimes features guest appearances by stars of other CBS programs. In the April Fools' Day 2013 episode, Carey and announcer George Gray switched places with the models, letting the two men be the models for the episode. On the April Fools' Day 2014 episode, Carey and Gray traded positions with Craig Ferguson (who was hosting The Late Late Show at the time) and Shadoe Stevens, reprising their respective roles on Ferguson's show while Ferguson hosted and Stevens announced on Price. On the first week of Season 46 (September 18-22, 2017), Carey celebrated his ten years as host of the show, joining Barker as the only two to have hosted for at least a decade.|$|E

2500|$|Lastly, Shakespeare {{finishes}} the sonnet (as expected) with a couplet: two consecutive rhyming lines. Each line contains ten syllables, {{and the second}} line is composed only of one-syllable words. Some scholars attribute the monosyllable <b>closing</b> <b>line</b> of the poem {{as a tribute to}} 16th century poet, George Gascoigne. Gascoigne is quoted as saying, [...] "The more monosyllables that you use, the truer Englishman you shall seemed, and the less you shall smell of the Inkhorn".|$|E

2500|$|Gleason revived The Honeymooners—first with Sue Ane Langdon as Alice and Patricia Wilson as Trixie for two {{episodes of}} The American Scene Magazine, then with Sheila MacRae as Alice and Jane Kean as Trixie for the 1966 series.

[...] In 1966, he abandoned the American Scene Magazine format and converted the show into a standard variety hour with guest performers.|$|E
2500|$|Booth {{understands the}} couplet to have sexual overtones. In the phrase, [...] "I had thee as a dream" [...] Booth {{suggests}} that [...] "had" [...] means [...] "possessed sexually" [...] or [...] "embraced". Sexual dreams were a common Renaissance topic and Booth suggests that Shakespeare is playing on this usage. He cites Spenser's The Faerie Queene 1.1.47-49, Jonson's The Dream, Herrick's The Vine, Othello 3.3.416-432, and Gascoigne's Supposes, 1.2.133 as contemporary works that contain sexual dreams. Booth also proposes that [...] "matter" [...] in the <b>closing</b> <b>line</b> has a sexual meaning {{in addition to}} meaning [...] "real substance". Here he cites examples of matter being used in its sexual sense in Hamlet 3.2.111: [...] "country matter" [...] and Julius Caesar 1.1.23: [...] "women matters".|$|E

2500|$|Scholars though have {{disagreements}} {{about the}} end for which the Platonic theory is used. In [...] "the usual interpretation of an elliptical construction," [...] the ending couplet expresses further praise [...] for the youth, seeming to say that while all things beautiful are shades of the youth, the youth like nothing else, is distinguished by a constant, faithful heart. Considering the sonnets expressing betrayal in Sonnets 40-42, this sonnet extolling the youth's constancy seems absurd for some scholars and is problematic. Seymour-Smith suggests that the last line should be interpreted: [...] "you feel affection for no one, and no one admires you for the virtue of constancy". Duncan Jones agrees and suggests that the word [...] "but" [...] {{at the beginning of}} the <b>closing</b> <b>line</b> radically changes all that has gone before and marks a turn to a more critical perspective.|$|E
2500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "Bad Guy" [...] is {{produced}} by S1, M-Phazes, and Streetrunner, with a chorus sung by Sarah Jaffe, the song {{has been described as}} a sequel to Eminem's [...] "Stan" [...] from The Marshall Mathers LP. [...] "Survival" [...] features a chorus sung by Liz Rodrigues and production by DJ Khalil. On the anthemic track, Eminem celebrates his return over [...] "breakneck, arena-rock" [...] electric guitars and [...] "trashy" [...] drums. [...] "Berzerk" [...] {{is produced by}} Rubin and pays homage to old-school hip hop. With samples from the Beastie Boys' [...] "The New Style" [...] and [...] "Fight for Your Right", and Billy Squier's [...] "The Stroke", the track is [...] "a punchy, guitar-and-beats driven song which channels Joan Jett & the Blackhearts' [...] "I Love Rock 'n' Roll" [...] and Licensed to Ill-era Beastie Boys." [...] Produced by DVLP, [...] "Rap God" [...] sees Eminem rapping over an EDM-inspired instrumental with varied flows. He pays tribute to many influential hip hop acts, but also proclaims himself an all-time best, with the <b>closing</b> <b>line</b> stating: [...] "Why be a king when you can be a god?" [...] "The Monster" [...] is a [...] "dark", [...] "demon-battling" [...] song, with the production that was handled and provided by Frequency. The track features backing vocals from Bebe Rexha and a chorus by Rihanna.|$|E
2500|$|The DMWD {{had been}} asked {{to come up with a}} device capable of {{penetrating}} the , [...] concrete defences that made up part of the Atlantic Wall. It was further specified that the device should be capable of being launched from landing craft since it was highly likely that the beaches in front of the defences would act as a killing ground for anyone attempting to deliver the device by hand. Sub-Lieutenant Nevil Shute calculated that over [...] of explosives would be needed in order to create a tank-sized breach in such a wall. The delivery method for such a quantity of explosives posed a significant problem, and one of the concepts discussed ultimately resulted in the construction of the prototype [...] "Great Panjandrum". The proposed device was composed of two wooden wheels, ten feet in diameter with steel treads a foot wide, joined by a central drum fitted with the explosive payload. It was to be propelled by sets of cordite rockets attached to each wheel. It was predicted that when deployed with a full [...] load, Panjandrum would achieve speeds of around , simply crashing through any obstacles to reach its target. The name [...] "Great Panjandrum" [...] was chosen by Shute as a reference to Samuel Foote's famous extempore nonsense paragraph (though Foote's term was actually [...] "the grand Panjandrum"), and in particular to its <b>closing</b> <b>line</b> [...] "till the gunpowder ran out at the heels of their boots".|$|E
