50|$|Other {{than the}} {{integrated}} <b>contactless</b> <b>microchip</b> which holds {{a wider range}} of personal data than the information visible on the front or reverse of the card, the Ukrainian identity card makes use of a range of modern security techniques, including micro-printing, holographic elements, colour-changing ink, raised printing, laser embossing, and UV elements, visible only under ultraviolet light.|$|E
50|$|The current Ukrainian {{identity}} card {{takes the form}} of a credit card sized plastic card with an integrated <b>contactless</b> <b>microchip</b> on which personal data is held. The top of the card bears the coat of arms of Ukraine, the name of the country - Ukraine, and the words 'Passport of the Citizen of Ukraine' in both Ukrainian and English. The flag of Ukraine appears in the top right corner of the card, whilst the international symbol for biometric documents can be found in the top left corner.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{report the}} design and {{implementation}} of sensing and control of local temperature in polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic reaction chip, based on the fabrication of a microtemperature sensor with thermochromic color bars and the associated optical and electronic feedback controls. The thermochromic color bar demonstrates easy and accurate local temperature monitoring. In combination with a microheater, this <b>contactless</b> <b>microchip</b> temperature control approach may have wide application potentials in microchemical and microbiological analyses.

40|$|A {{microfabricated}} electrophoresis chip with {{an integrated}} contactless conductivity detection system is described. The new <b>contactless</b> conductivity <b>microchip</b> detector {{is based on}} placing two planar sensing aluminum film electrodes on the outer side of a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) microchip (without contacting the solution) and measuring the impedance of the solution in the separation channel. The contactless route obviates problems (e. g., fouling, unwanted reactions) associated with the electrode-solution contact, offers isolation of the detection system from high separation fields, does not compromise the separation efficiency, and greatly simplifies the detector fabrication. Relevant experimental variables, such as the frequency and amplitude of the applied ac voltage or the separation voltage, were examined and optimized. The detector performance was illustrated by the separation of potassium, sodium, barium, and lithium cations and the chloride, sulfate, fluoride, acetate, and phosphate anions. The response was linear (over the 20 microM- 7 mM range) and reproducible (RSD = 3. 4 - 4. 9 %; n = 10), with detection limits of 2. 8 and 6. 4 microM (for potassium and chloride, respectively). The advantages associated with the contactless conductivity detection, along with the low cost of the integrated PMMA chip/detection system, should enhance the power and scope of microfluidic analytical devices...|$|R
