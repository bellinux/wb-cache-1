25|$|Cefalexin, also spelled cephalexin, is an {{antibiotic}} that can treat {{a number of}} bacterial infections. It kills gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria by disrupting {{the growth of the}} bacterial cell wall. Cefalexin is a beta-lactam antibiotic within the class of first-generation cephalosporins. It works similarly to other agents within this class, including intravenous <b>cefazolin,</b> but can be taken by mouth.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrazine is a {{precursor}} to several pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Often these applications involve conversion of hydrazine to heterocyclic rings such as pyrazoles and pyridazines. [...] Examples of commercialized bioactive hydrazine derivatives include <b>cefazolin,</b> rizatriptan, anastrozole, [...] fluconazole, metazachlor, metamitron, metribuzin, paclobutrazol, diclobutrazole, propiconazole,hydrazine sulfate, diimide and triadimefon.|$|E
50|$|The {{cephalosporin}} series includes intermediate 7-ACA, <b>cefazolin</b> sodium, <b>cefazolin</b> {{acid and}} ceftriaxone sodium. Meropenem API is also produced.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefazolin</b> {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} in treating methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) but does not work in cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In many instances of staphylococcal infections, such as bacteremia, <b>cefazolin</b> is an alternative to penicillin in patients who are allergic to penicillin. However, there is still potential for a reaction to occur with <b>cefazolin</b> and other cephalosporins in patients allergic to penicillin. Resistance to <b>cefazolin</b> is seen in several species of bacteria, such as Mycoplasma and Chlamydia, in which case different generations of cephalosporins may be more effective. <b>Cefazolin</b> does not fight against Enterococcus, anaerobic bacteria or atypical bacteria among others.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} antibiotics, <b>cefazolin</b> may {{interact}} with other medications being taken. Some important drugs that may interact with <b>cefazolin</b> such as probenecid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefazolin</b> is {{pregnancy}} category B, indicating {{general safety}} {{for use in}} pregnancy. Caution {{should be used in}} breastfeeding as a small amount of <b>cefazolin</b> enters the breast milk. <b>Cefazolin</b> can be used prophylactically against perinatal Group B streptococcal infection (GBS). Although penicillin and ampicillin are the standard of care for GBS prophylaxis, penicillin-allergic women with no history of anaphylaxis can be given <b>cefazolin</b> instead. These patients should be closely monitored as there is a small chance of an allergic reaction due to the similar structure of the antibiotics.|$|E

50|$|SmithKline Corp. (SKC) and Eli Lilly and Co. (Lilly) were {{manufacturers}} of prescription drugs, including antibiotics. In 1964 Lilly Lilly introduced the first cephalosporin antibiotic, Keflin (cephalothin), into the United States market. It subsequently introduced four additional cephalosporin drugs: in 1972 Keflex (cephalexin), in 1967 Loridine (cephaloridine), in 1971 Kafocin (cephaloglycin), and in 1973 Kefzol (<b>cefazolin).</b> Lilly had patents on all its cephalosporin antibiotics except Kefzol (<b>cefazolin),</b> which this case concerns. From 1964 to 1972, Lilly's patents {{gave it a}} monopoly over all the cephalosporin drugs then in use. In 1973, competitors began to introduce new cephalosporins. The first was SKC's Ancef (cefazolin); Lilly then introduced Kefzol, its identical form of <b>cefazolin.</b>|$|E
50|$|There is no {{penetration}} {{into the}} central nervous system and therefore <b>cefazolin</b> is not effective in treating meningitis.|$|E
50|$|People with {{kidney disease}} {{and those on}} {{hemodialysis}} may need the dose adjusted. <b>Cefazolin</b> levels are not significantly affected by liver disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefazolin</b> {{inhibits}} {{cell wall}} biosynthesis by binding Penicillin binding proteins which stops peptidoglycan synthesis. Penicillin binding proteins are bacterial proteins {{that help to}} catalyze the last stages of peptidoglycan synthesis, which is needed to maintain the cell wall. They remove the D-alanine from the precursor of the peptidoglycan. The lack of synthesis causes the bacteria to lyse because they also continually break down their cell walls. <b>Cefazolin</b> is bactericidal, meaning it kills the bacteria rather than inhibiting their growth.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{those of}} several other cephalosporins, the {{chemical}} structure of <b>cefazolin</b> contains an N-methylthiodiazole (NMTD or 1-MTD) side-chain. As the antibiotic is broken down in the body, it releases free NMTD, which can cause hypoprothrombinemia (likely due to inhibition of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase) and a reaction with ethanol similar to that produced by disulfiram (Antabuse), due to inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase. Those with an allergy to [...] penicillin may develop a cross sensitivity to <b>cefazolin.</b>|$|E

50|$|Patients with {{penicillin}} allergies could {{experience a}} potential reaction to <b>cefazolin</b> and other cephalosporins. As with other antibiotics, patients experiencing watery and/or bloody stools occurring {{up to three}} months following therapy should contact their prescriber.|$|E
50|$|Probenecid is {{sometimes}} used {{to increase the}} concentration of some antibiotics. Specifically, {{a small amount of}} evidence supports the use of intravenous <b>cefazolin</b> once rather than three times a day when it is combined with probenecid.|$|E
5000|$|While [...] Lactobacillus fermentum {{has been}} found to have {{antibiotic}} resistant properties, other studies have demonstrated that lactobacillus fermentum is sensitive to some common antibiotics such as gentamicin, <b>cefazolin,</b> penicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, carbenicillin, erythromycin, amikacin, and cholorampehnicol.|$|E
50|$|As a first-generation {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic, <b>cefazolin</b> {{and other}} first-generation antibiotics are very active against gram-positive bacteria and some gram-negative bacteria.

5000|$|The {{types of}} {{antibiotics}} that P. oryzihabitans {{are resistant to}} ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and <b>cefazolin.</b> [...] Since these bacteria are not as harmful or virulent to the host, antibiotics should clear up the infection, although in some cases, since they can be found around the sites of prosthetic material, catheter removal is required.|$|E
5000|$|Cefalotin (INN) [...] or {{cephalothin}} (USAN) [...] is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. It was {{the first}} cephalosporin marketed (1964) {{and continues to be}} widely used. It is an intravenously administered agent with a similar antimicrobial spectrum to <b>cefazolin</b> and the oral agent cefalexin. Cefalotin sodium is marketed as Keflin (Lilly) and under other trade names.|$|E
5000|$|For mild-to-moderate community-acquired {{infections in}} adults, the agents {{recommended}} for empiric regimens are: ticarcillin- clavulanate, cefoxitin, ertapenem, moxifloxacin, or tigecycline as single-agent therapy or combinations of metronidazole with <b>cefazolin,</b> cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, levofloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. Agents no longer recommended are: cefotetan and clindamycin ( [...] Bacteroides fragilis group resistance) and ampicillin-sulbactam (E. coli resistance) and ainoglycosides (toxicity).|$|E

50|$|<b>Cefazolin,</b> {{also known}} as cefazoline and cephazolin, is an {{antibiotic}} used {{for the treatment of}} a number of bacterial infections. Specifically it is used to treat cellulitis, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, endocarditis, joint infection, and biliary tract infections. It is also used to prevent group B streptococcal disease around the time of delivery and before surgery. It is typically given by injection into a muscle or vein.|$|E
50|$|The only {{reliable}} way {{to prevent}} EOD currently is intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), {{that is to say}} administration of antibiotics during delivery. It has been proved that intravenous penicillin or ampicillin administered for ≥4 hours before delivery to GBS colonized women are very effective at preventing vertical transmission of GBS from mother to baby and EOD. <b>Cefazolin,</b> clindamycin, and vancomycin are used to prevent EOD in infants born to penicillin-allergic mothers.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a common}} side effect that can develop when other {{medications}} are used. This {{is the development of}} cross sensitivities to other antibiotics. If someone has developed side effects when taking penicillin, these side effects may develop with a new medication even though the person has not taken the new medication before. Those medications that may cause a cross sensitivity reaction are: carbapenems, ampicillin, <b>cefazolin,</b> cephalosporins and cloxacillin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cefazolin</b> was {{patented}} in 1967 {{and came}} into commercial use in 1971. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 1.20 to 1.41 USD per day. In the United States a course of treatment costs 25 to 50 USD.|$|E
50|$|Penicillin-allergic {{women without}} {{a history of}} {{anaphylaxis}} (angioedema, respiratory distress, or urticaria) following administration of a penicillin or a cephalosporin (low risk of anaphylaxis) could receive <b>cefazolin</b> (2 g IV initial dose, then 1 g IV every 8 hours until delivery) instead of penicillin or ampicillin. Clindamycin (900 mg IV every 8 hours until delivery), and vancomycin (1 g IV every 12 hours until delivery) are used to prevent GBS-EOD in infants born to penicillin-allergic mothers. Erythromycin is not recommended under any circumstances today.|$|E
50|$|To treat ocular infections, {{antifungal}} medication such as oral voriconazole and amphotericin B eyedrops can {{be administered}} to the patient. Fortified tobramycin, fortified <b>cefazolin,</b> fluorometholone, and scopolamine eyedrops can also be administered if necessary, depending on the symptoms. In addition, corneal abrasion can be performed on the patient to facilitate penetration of the antifungal medication. Amphotericin B therapy, surgical removal of infected tissue, and immune enhancement {{can be used to}} treat cerebral phaeohyphomycosis by Thielavia subthermophila, although despite treatment, is associated with high mortality. Currently, there is no accepted standard treatment for brain infections by T. subthermophila.|$|E
5000|$|One {{important}} consideration {{to determine the}} safety of Lactobacillus fermentum is transferable resistant genes. In order for [...] L. fermentum to {{be considered as a}} potential probiotic, it must not contain any transferable resistant genes. If a resistance gene is transferable, it could lessen the effect of the use of antibiotics. Out of ten common antibiotic genes that were tested (gatamicin, <b>cefazolin,</b> penicillin, trimethoprim/sulfmethoxazole, ampicillin, carbenicillin, erythromycin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, and norfloxacin), Lactobacillus fermentum was found to only be resistant to amikacin and norfloxacin. Others studies have reported that most LABs are also resistant to these antibiotics, which led to the conclusion that it was a common characteristic of LABs. The resistance to these antibiotics can be considered natural or intrinsic. So far no observed Lactobacillus fermentum strains have been observed to have transferable resistance or acquired resistance genes ...|$|E
5000|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{previously}} published on lysostaphin since its isolation, both in vitro and in vivo. Lysostaphin {{has been shown to}} eradicate susceptible S. aureus biofilms. It has also been reported to be effective in disrupting S. epidermidis biofilms in vitro, albeit at higher concentrations of the enzyme. Compared to commonly used antibiotics such as vancomycin, lysostaphin has been shown to demonstrate greater antibacterial activity in vitro. The enzyme has demonstrated effectiveness against methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) mediated keratitis in vivo in a rabbit model. Additionally, {{it has been shown that}} lysostaphin combined with antimicrobials such as <b>cefazolin,</b> clarithromycin, doxycycline, levofloxacin, linezolid and quinuprisitin/dalfopristin has a synergistic effect for MSSA strains of the bacteria. [...] A study published by Belyansky et al. illustrated that a lysostaphin bound mesh demonstrated dramatic preservation results in a rat model.|$|E
50|$|First {{isolated}} from dental caries, Rothia dentocariosa is largely benign, but does very rarely cause disease. The most common Rothia infection is endocarditis, typically {{in people with}} underlying heart valve disorders. Literature case reports show other tissues that are rarely infected include the peritoneum, tonsils, lung, cornea, inner layers of the eye (Endophthalmitis) and brain and intercranial tissues.It has been implicated in periodontal disease, and one hypothesis is that Rothia periodontal disease, or dental procedures in turn, may be first steps in the infection of other tissues. One case reports on a fatal Rothia dentocariosa infection of a fetus in utero. Another reports the bacterium was responsible for septic arthritis in the knee of a person treated with etanercept for rheumatoid arthritis. Like other Rothia infections reported in the literature, once the cause of infection was identified, this responded fully to treatment with antibiotics. Rothia infections may be treated with penicillins, erythromycin, <b>cefazolin,</b> rifampin, aminoglycoside, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.|$|E
50|$|Follow-up {{studies by}} Levy et al. and Stannard at al. both {{examined}} failure rates for posterolateral corner repairs and reconstructions. Failure rates repairs were approximately 37 - 41% while reconstructions had a failure rate of 9%. Other less common surgical complications include {{deep vein thrombosis}} (DVTs), infection, blood loss, and nerve/artery damage. The {{best way to avoid}} these complications is to preemptively treat them. DVTs are typically treated prophylactically with either aspirin or sequential compression devices (SCDs). In high risk patients there may be a need for prophylactic administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). In addition, having a patient get out of bed and ambulate soon after surgery is a time honored way to prevent DVTs. Infection is typically controlled by administering 1 gram of the antibiotic <b>cefazolin</b> (Ancef) prior to surgery. Excessive blood loss and nerve/artery damage are rare occurrences in surgery and can usually be avoided with proper technique and diligence; however, the patient should be warned of these potential complications, especially in patients with severe injuries and scarring.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground/PurposeThe {{susceptibility}} breakpoints of cephalosporins for Enterobacteriaceae were revised by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) in 2010 and 2011. The clinical {{outcome and}} susceptibility {{data were analyzed}} to evaluate the impact of revised CLSI <b>cefazolin</b> breakpoints on the treatment of Escherichia coli bacteremia. MethodsForty-three bacteremic Escherichia coli isolates from Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, {{during the period from}} January 2013 to December 2013, were selected to analyze the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distributions of <b>cefazolin</b> and the correlated clinical responses to <b>cefazolin</b> therapy. ResultsThe modal <b>cefazolin</b> MIC among the 43 isolates was 1  μg/mL and accounted for 18 (42 %) isolates. The cumulative percentage for MICs ≤ 2  μg/mL was 79 %. The conventional dosing regimens achieved clinical cure in 33 (97 %) of 34 patients with bacteremia due to E. coli with a <b>cefazolin</b> MIC ≤ 2  μg/mL, in all of the six patients with a <b>cefazolin</b> MIC of 4  μg/mL, and all of the three patients with a <b>cefazolin</b> MIC of 8  μg/mL. ConclusionThe microbiological data support the revised CLSI breakpoints of <b>cefazolin.</b> The conventional <b>cefazolin</b> dosing regimens can still achieve satisfactory clinical cure rates for bacteremia of E. coli with a <b>cefazolin</b> MIC ≤ 2  μg/mL in patients without severe septic shock. Before the approval of the efficacy of <b>cefazolin</b> for the treatment of E. coli isolates with a <b>cefazolin</b> MIC of 4  μg/mL, it is prudent to use <b>cefazolin</b> only when a high drug level can be achieved in the infection site, such as the urinary tract...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cefazolin</b> and {{cephalothin}} disk susceptibility {{and minimal}} inhibitory concentration determinations {{were conducted on}} 591 clinical isolates. <b>Cefazolin</b> demonstrated superior activity, as shown by lower minimal inhibitory concentrations, and {{a greater percentage of}} isolates inhibited in the disk susceptibility test.
