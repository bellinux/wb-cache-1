5|$|Cartman {{frequently}} teases Kenny {{for being}} poor, and derides Kenny's family {{for being on}} welfare. He will also use an awkward pause during a <b>conversation</b> <b>as</b> an opportunity to casually remind Kenny that he hates him. Cartman's mischievous treatment of Butters Stotch, and the relationship the duo shares has received significant focus in the more recent seasons of the series. This reflects Parker's interest; the scenes between the two are the ones he most enjoys writing.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the birth}} of ASL, sign {{language}} had been used by various communities in the United States. In the United States, as elsewhere in the world, hearing families with deaf children have historically employed ad-hoc home sign, which often reaches much higher levels of sophistication than gestures used by hearing people in spoken <b>conversation.</b> <b>As</b> early as 1541 at first contact by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, there were reports that the Plains Indians had developed a sign language to communicate between tribes of different languages.|$|E
5|$|Attempts by fans {{to write}} in Quenya began in the 1970s, when the total corpus of {{published}} Elvish comprised {{only a few hundred}} words. Since then, the use of Elvish has flourished in poems and texts, phrases and names, and even tattoos. But Tolkien himself never made his languages complete enough for <b>conversation.</b> <b>As</b> a result, newly invented Elvish texts require conjecture and sometimes the coinage of new words. The use of Quenya has expanded over the years as new words have been created, forming a Neo-Quenya language that is based on Tolkien's original Quenya but incorporates many new elements.|$|E

5|$|People {{identifying}} with Asperger syndrome may refer to themselves in casual <b>conversation</b> <b>as</b> aspies (a term first used in print by Liane Holliday Willey in 1999). The word neurotypical (abbreviated NT) describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical, {{and is often}} used to refer to non-autistic people. The Internet has allowed individuals with AS {{to communicate with each other}} in a way that was not previously possible because of their rarity and geographic dispersal, forming a subculture composed of people with Asperger's. Internet sites like Wrong Planet have made it easier for individuals to connect.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{is called}} {{into a room}} in the library by Jenny’s group, who try to bribe her into not turning them in to the Hearst police. However, she denies and records their <b>conversation</b> <b>as</b> further proof. They are hiding a third ID machine, and Veronica tells Weevil to go and find it. Dick shows Logan a sex tape of Piz and Veronica that has been {{circulating}} in an email. Because Logan thinks Piz posted the tape, he attacks Piz and hits him incessantly. Weevil does have a student ID machine, and Logan walks into Mars Investigations with Piz’s blood on him.|$|E
5|$|The credits appear over a {{flashback}} to a Christmas dinner {{where all the}} Scoobies are present, having a typical lighthearted <b>conversation</b> <b>as</b> Joyce and Buffy discuss a pie that drops on the floor. The scene snaps back to Buffy in the living room, shaking Joyce and screaming at her. She calls for an ambulance and attempts CPR, accidentally snapping a rib in the process, but to no avail. Buffy calls Giles. The paramedics arrive and work on Joyce and she revives, the paramedics declare it a miracle in the ambulance, and Joyce, Buffy, and Dawn rejoice in the hospital. The scene snaps back {{to the living room}} where the paramedics continue to work on Joyce until they stop and tell Buffy that Joyce is dead. They leave, and Buffy goes into the hall and vomits. Giles arrives and Buffy tells him not to move the body, shocking herself by using that word.|$|E
50|$|Quality {{of service}} is {{particularly}} important for the transport of traffic with special requirements. In particular, developers have introduced technology to allow computer networks to become as useful as telephone networks for audio <b>conversations,</b> <b>as</b> well as supporting new applications with even stricter service demands.|$|R

25|$|While Knatchbull was on Norfolk Island, Thomas Atkins, an Independent clergyman who {{was sent}} to Norfolk Island as a Chaplain in November 1836 on the {{recommendation}} of the London Missionary Society, said of Knatchbull from his personal appearance and <b>conversation,</b> <b>as</b> all traces of a gentleman had long disappeared, he exhibited no evidence that he had been in a higher social position; indeed he appeared to be in his natural place.|$|E
25|$|The Flying Car, a {{short film}} {{featuring}} Dante and Randal. The short {{was shot in}} 2001 for The Tonight Show and features the two main characters from Clerks stuck in traffic having a somewhat similar <b>conversation</b> <b>as</b> the one in Clerks where the two are driving to a funeral and discussing sexual curiosity. On the DVD, the short is presented in its original cut with an introduction from Smith.|$|E

25|$|The terms {{substrate}} and superstrate {{are often}} used when two languages interact. However, the meaning of these terms is reasonably well-defined only in second language acquisition or language replacement events, when the native speakers of a certain source language (the substrate) are somehow compelled to abandon it for another target language (the superstrate). The outcome of such an event is that erstwhile speakers of the substrate will use some version of the superstrate, at least in more formal contexts. The substrate may survive {{as a second language}} for informal <b>conversation.</b> <b>As</b> demonstrated by the fate of many replaced European languages (such as Etruscan, Breton, and Venetian), the influence of the substrate on the official speech is often limited to pronunciation and a modest number of loanwords. The substrate might even disappear altogether without leaving any trace.|$|E
25|$|In {{the park}} on a Sunday some time later, George {{sketches}} a disgruntled Boatman to the disapproval of an observing Jules. Dot enters {{on the arm of}} Louis, a baker. Two chatting shopgirls, both named Celeste, notice Dot with a new man ("Gossip"). When Jules and Yvonne's daughter Louise attempts to pet the Boatman's dog, he shouts at her, then lashes out at George and storms off. George and Dot have a strained <b>conversation</b> <b>as</b> she works on the grammar book she is using to teach herself how to read and write. As Jules and Yvonne mock the unconventional nature of George's art, they discuss an initiative to have his work included in the next group show, which they both protest. George sketches two dogs while whimsically trying to imagine the world from their perspective, describing their relief to be free of their routines on Sunday ("The Day Off"). As the day goes on, George quietly sketches denizens of the park: The two Celestes try {{to attract the attention of}} a pair of Soldiers, fighting over which will get the more handsome of the two; the Nurse hides from the Old Lady and attempts to attract Franz's attention; Franz and his wife Frieda argue with Louise and each other; a pair of wealthy American tourists pass by, hating everything about Paris but the pastries, and plan to return home with a baker in tow; Jules returns to further lecture George on his shortcomings as an artist, receiving in response an invitation to see his new painting; the Boatman reappears to rebuke artists' condescending attitude. Dot sees George, but he slips away before she can speak to him, and in retaliation she describes her satisfying new life with Louis. She clearly misses and loves George, but Louis loves, respects and needs her in a way George cannot, and she has made her choice ("Everybody Loves Louis").|$|E
500|$|Sorkin's {{trademark}} rapid-fire {{dialogue and}} extended monologues are complemented, in television, by frequent collaborator Thomas Schlamme's characteristic directing technique called the [...] "walk and talk". These sequences consist of single tracking shots of long duration involving multiple characters engaging in <b>conversation</b> <b>as</b> they {{move through the}} set; characters enter and exit the <b>conversation</b> <b>as</b> the shot continues without any cuts.|$|E

25|$|O'Brien {{used these}} <b>conversations</b> <b>as</b> {{the basis for}} a 2014 book 'Keating: The Interviews'. Keating {{repeatedly}} declared he would not write a memoir, so his cooperation with O'Brien was perceived as the closest he would come to producing an autobiography.|$|R

500|$|Guitarist {{and critic}} Bill Janovitz also {{emphasizes}} the urban, unreal quality of [...] "Visions of Johanna", {{calling it a}} [...] "sprawling epic". [...] "The journey takes Dylan through lofts, the D train, a museum, empty lots, and through snippets of overheard <b>conversation,</b> <b>as</b> well as a discussion with some 'little boy lost', who 'takes himself so seriously', and who is 'so useless and all/muttering small talk at the wall'." [...] For Janovitz, this [...] could [...] "possibly be a swipe at a critic".|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} {{features a}} deeper story with new characters, new weapons, and new enemies according to John DiMaggio, the voice actor for Marcus Fenix. New vehicles {{have been added}} to the game, such as the Centaur Tank, which lead designer Cliff Bleszinski describes as a [...] "tank with monster truck wheels." [...] Players will also ride a Brumak and Reavers in the game. Cut-scenes use the better facial rendering technology of Epic's Unreal engine, and engage in more dramatic angles for the <b>conversation,</b> <b>as</b> well as using a video screen on Jack (the all-purpose robot used by Delta squad) to talk with their commanders face-to-face.|$|E
500|$|Jensen went on {{to praise}} Walter and Walternate's <b>conversation</b> <b>as</b> [...] "devastatingly perfect," [...] commenting [...] "Just the very action of sitting, of Walternate {{choosing}} to literally to meet Walter at his lowest moment, was extraordinarily moving." [...] Dave Bradley of SFX magazine highlighted the episode's acting as one particular positive element, praising Torv and Noble for [...] "delivering perfect double performances." [...] Bradley also praised the scenes between the two Walters and two Astrids, writing that the [...] "moments of connection {{make the decision to}} split the universes apart incredibly poignant." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Andrew Hanson also praised the Walter-Walternate scenes, explaining that after their seated conversation [...] "you almost forget the two characters are played by the same actor. If this isn’t the year that John Noble gets recognition for his performances in Fringe, it will be a crime." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} Business <b>Conversations</b> <b>as</b> a high-level software structuring concept for distributed systems where multiple autonomous agents (possibly in different organizational units) have {{to coordinate their}} long-term activities towards the fulfillment of a cooperative task. We first motivate Business <b>Conversations</b> <b>as</b> a system model suitable for the description of human-human, human-software as well as software-software cooperation. We then explain why we consider this model be more suitable for the description o organizational cooperative work than software-centered object models. The core concepts of the Business Conversation model are described using an object-oriented model. Finally, we report on our experience gained building a prototypical agent programming framework with Business Conversations for agent coordination based on mobile and persistent threads as provided by the persistent programming language Tycoon...|$|R
500|$|Social context {{involves}} {{pointing out}} social norms and violations of these norms. This form of context is most {{commonly found in}} <b>conversation,</b> <b>as</b> opposed to reading or other word learning environments. A child's understanding of social norms can help them to infer the meaning of words that occur in conversation. In an English-speaking tradition, [...] "please" [...] and [...] "thank you" [...] are taught to children {{at a very early}} age, so they are very familiar to the child by school-age. For example, if a group of people is eating a meal with the child present and one person says, [...] "give me the bread" [...] and another responds with, [...] "that was rude. What do you say?", and the person responds with [...] "please", the child may not know the meaning of [...] "rude", but can infer its meaning through social context and understanding the necessity of saying [...] "please".|$|E
500|$|Mass Effect 2 {{contains}} {{voices from}} 90 voice actors who play 546 characters and speak over 25,000 lines of dialogue. Voice recording {{for the game}} took {{twice as long as}} the original Mass Effect. The Unreal Engine 3's Matinee tool, which allows developers to animate characters during cinematics, was integrated into BioWare's own technology for digital acting and <b>conversation.</b> <b>As</b> Hudson explained, [...] "Our writers write into a dialogue editor and that becomes fused with the way that you end up seeing many different pieces of Matinee play out in combination when you have a conversation with characters." [...] Another Unreal Engine 3 technology, Kismet, was used for scripting how levels or enemies would respond to a certain action. As the game's programmers were already familiar with the Unreal Engine 3 after using it on the first Mass Effect game, they did not feel the need to constantly communicate with Epic Games for support.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the more}} notable events during the {{recording}} of Wish You Were Here occurred on 5 June 1975, the day Gilmour married his first wife, Ginger, {{on the eve of}} Pink Floyd's second US tour that year. [...] The band {{were in the process of}} completing the final mix of [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" [...] when an overweight man with shaven head and eyebrows, and holding a plastic bag, entered the room. [...] Waters, who was working in the studio, initially did not recognise him. [...] Wright was also mystified by the identity of the visitor, presumed he was a friend of Waters' and asked him, but soon realised that it was Syd Barrett. [...] Gilmour initially presumed he was an EMI staff member. Mason also failed to recognise him and was [...] "horrified" [...] when Gilmour identified him. [...] In Mason's personal memoir of Pink Floyd, , he recalled Barrett's <b>conversation</b> <b>as</b> [...] "desultory and not entirely sensible". Storm Thorgerson later reflected on Barrett's presence: [...] "Two or three people cried. [...] He sat round and talked for a bit but he wasn't really there." ...|$|E
