This realization creates an imperative for ‘carbon-negative ’ mitigation measures; that is, measures that can reduce atmospheric carbon faster than emissions will load the atmosphere. Among such measures, air extraction technology, coupled with secure sequestration, offers advantages of centralization and control without direct intervention in the biosphere or major <b>collateral</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impact.</b> Significant new scientific developments in air extraction show promise of greatly reduced costs, such that decreasing the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere to substantailly lower risk levels may be economically practicable.

40|$|In this study, {{the spatial}} {{variation}} of potential <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of bioenergy crops is quantitatively assessed. The cultivation of sugar beet and Miscanthus for bioethanol {{production in the}} North of the Netherlands {{is used as a}} case study. The <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> included are greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (during lifecycle and related to direct land use change), soil quality, water quantity and quality, and biodiversity. Suitable methods are selected and adapted based on an extensive literature review. The spatial variation in <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> related to the spatial heterogeneity of the physical context is assessed using Geographical Information System (GIS). The case study shows that there are large spatial variations in <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of the introduction of bioenergy crops. Land use change (LUC) to sugar beet generally causes more negative <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> than LUC to Miscanthus. LUC to Miscanthus could have positive <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> in some areas. The most negative <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of a shift towards sugar beet and Miscanthus occur in the western wet pasture areas. The spatially combined results of the <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> illustrate that there are several trade offs between environmental impacts: there are no areas were no negative <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> occur. The assessment demonstrates a framework to identify areas with potential negative <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of bioenergy crop production and areas where bioenergy crop production have little negative or even positive <b>environmental</b> <b>impact...</b>|$|R

In order to decrease environmental hazards of pesticide, risk of pesticide application should be measured briefly and precisely. In this study <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of registered insecticides in Iran which applied in 2001 - 2002, 2003 - 2004, 2004 - 2005, are considered using <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> quotient (EIQ) index. Results showed that among considered insecticides, Imidacloprid, Fipronil and Tiodicarb, potentially (EIQ) were the most hazardous insecticides, respectively. Taking rate of application and active ingredient of insecticide in to account, <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> (practical toxicity) per cultivated hectare (EIQ Field) of each provinces were investigated. In this regard, among different province of Iran, Kerman, Mazandaran and Golestan were in danger more than the others, respectively. Besides, considering the amount of agricultural production in provinces, <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> per ton of production were calculated for each provinces which three northern provinces of Mazandaran, Golestan and Guilan, respectively endure the most <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> per ton of production. Eventually based on <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> quotient, results demonstrated that majority of <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of insecticide in Iran were due to inadequate knowledge and also overuse of a few number of insecticides. Therefore, by improving knowledge about <b>environmental</b> <b>impact</b> of pesticides and also developing environmental friendly and ecological based methods, negative <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> of insecticides will be reduced significantly...|$|R
