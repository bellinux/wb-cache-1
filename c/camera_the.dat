5|$|Many fans wanted Snake Eater {{to use a}} 3D camera, {{but this}} was {{ultimately}} not implemented in the game. Kojima views Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater as a trilogy, and wished to keep the <b>camera</b> <b>the</b> same as the previous two {{in order to keep}} the feel of the three games the same. He did, however, acknowledge that the current trend for video games is to use the 3D <b>camera.</b> <b>The</b> camera was later implemented in an updated version of Snake Eater titled , and further installments in the franchise.|$|E

5000|$|An {{innovation}} to <b>the</b> PTZ <b>camera</b> is {{a built-in}} firmware program that monitors {{the change of}} pixels generated by the video clip in <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> When <b>the</b> pixels change due to movement within <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> field of view, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> can actually focus on the pixel variation and move <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> {{in an attempt to}} center the pixel fluctuation on the video chip. This process results in <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> following movement. <b>The</b> program allows <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> to estimate <b>the</b> size of the object which is moving and distance of the movement from <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> With this estimate, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> can adjust <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> optical lens in and out in an attempt to stabilize the size of pixel fluctuation as a percentage of total viewing area.

5|$|In a {{panoramic}} <b>camera,</b> <b>the</b> focal-plane shutter {{was replaced by}} a rotation of 180° of the lens itself.

50|$|<b>The</b> Orbiter <b>camera</b> seat is a {{seat for}} a {{cameraman}} that swivels {{at a low}} working height. The orbiter {{is characterized by a}} partial separation of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> and <b>the</b> movable/swivelling seat. This ensures that the natural vibrations of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> operator are absorbed in the seat and are, therefore, transferred to <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> to a very small extent. This is especially important with telephoto lens with up to x101 zoom, where vibration resistance is vital for stable pictures. The swiveling seat is not mounted on <b>the</b> centre <b>camera</b> column (which would increase vibration), but it rotates with <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> as <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> pans. <b>The</b> name ‘Orbiter’ was chosen because the cameraman is in orbit around <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> and because orbital means ‘concerning an eyeball’, and <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> is an electronic eye.|$|R
