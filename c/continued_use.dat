5|$|In 1969, Nixon {{administration}} Mint Director Mary Brooks {{sought the}} reissuance {{of the dollar}} coin. By this time, rising bullion prices threatened the <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> of silver in the Kennedy half dollar, but Brooks hoped to maintain the dollar as a silver coin. Brooks' proposal for a new silver dollar was opposed by {{the chairman of the}} House Banking Committee, Wright Patman, who had been convinced by Nixon's predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, to support the <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> of silver in the half dollar against his better judgment.|$|E

40|$|As online social {{networking}} services (OSNS) {{become more and}} more ubiquitous, users are more likely to become targets and/or victims of cybercrimes, simply because they need to disclose personal information if they use OSNS. Should they <b>continue</b> <b>using</b> OSNS? By adopting the Utility Maximization Theory (UMT) as a theoretical lens to provide a research model, this paper identifies the benefits and costs that users need to balance in order to make their decision about whether or not to <b>continue</b> <b>using</b> OSNS. The benefits that users can get from OSNS include Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Enjoyment. The costs include Privacy Concerns and Previous Privacy Invasion Experiences. This paper proposes that users’ Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Enjoyment positively influence their intention to <b>continue</b> <b>using</b> OSNS, whereas their Privacy Concerns and Previous Privacy Invasion Experiences negatively influence their intention to <b>continue</b> <b>using</b> OSNS. When they perceive that the benefits are larger than the costs, users tend to <b>continue</b> <b>using</b> OSNS, and vice versa...|$|R

5|$|In the {{interests}} of standardising health-related units of measure used in the nuclear industry, the 12th CGPM (1964) accepted the <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> of the curie (symbol Ci) as a non-SI unit of activity for radionuclides; the becquerel, sievert and gray were adopted in later years. Similarly, the millimetre of mercury (symbol mmHg) was retained for measuring blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{during the}} Ramesside period, statues of Old Kingdom pharaohs {{including}} one of Nyuserre Ini were placed in a cachette (a hiding place) in the temple of Ptah in Memphis, suggesting their <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> for cultic purposes until that point. Concurrently with these activities, extensive restoration works in Abusir and Saqqara were undertaken {{during the reign of}} Ramses II under the direction of prince Khaemweset. The sun temple of Nyuserre was among the monuments benefiting from these works.|$|E
5|$|More {{schools for}} the deaf were founded after ASD, and {{knowledge}} of ASL spread to these schools. In addition, the rise of Deaf community organizations bolstered the <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> of ASL. Societies such as the National Association of the Deaf and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf held national conventions that attracted signers from across the country. This all contributed to ASL's wide use over a large geographical area, atypical of a sign language.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet Army {{captured}} {{large numbers}} of German armored vehicles, including Panzer IVs (Russian designation T-4). Some of them were pressed into temporary service and some others were used for training. Sometimes, captured tanks were used in different temporary units or as single tanks. While captured Tigers and Panthers were only permitted to be used until they broke down, {{the simplicity of the}} Panzer IV and the large number of captured parts allowed for repair and <b>continued</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first-line}} {{psychiatric treatment}} for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, which {{can reduce the}} positive symptoms of psychosis in about 7 to 14 days. Antipsychotics, however, fail to significantly improve the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. In those on antipsychotics, <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> decreases the risk of relapse. There is little evidence regarding effects from their use beyond two or three years. However use of anti-psychotics can lead to dopamine hypersensitivity increasing the risk of symptoms if antipsychotics are stopped.|$|E

5|$|The {{material}} of the Philomela myth {{has been used}} in various creative works—artistic and literary—for the past 2,500 years. Over the centuries, the myth has been associated with the image of the nightingale and its song described as both exceedingly beautiful and sorrowful. The <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> of the image in artistic, literary, and musical works has reinforced this association.|$|E
5|$|Early modern Europe saw the {{emergence}} {{for the first}} time of a distinctive elite culture: while the Reformation encouraged new skepticism and opposition to traditional beliefs, subsequent Romanticism encouraged the fetishisation of such beliefs by intellectual elites. The effects of this on writing about elves are most apparent in England and Germany, with developments in each country influencing the other. In Scandinavia, the Romantic movement was also prominent, and literary writing was the main context for <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> of the word elf, except in fossilised words for illnesses. However, oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|In their 2002 book Myofascial Pain and Fibromyalgia: Trigger Point Management authors {{orthopedic}} surgeon Edward S. Rachlin and physical therapist Isabel Rachlin recommended {{use of the}} Magic Wand for self-treatment by patients with myalgia. They wrote that <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> of the Magic Wand on myofascial trigger points or tense areas of muscle could result in decreasing the amount of discomfort felt by patients. Rachlin and Rachlin suggested that such treatment {{could be done in}} one's residence outside of a clinical setting.|$|E

5|$|Rhodesia's {{strategic}} position underwent {{a fundamental change}} in June 1975 when the Portuguese government suddenly withdrew from Mozambique which bordered Rhodesia on the east. Mozambique now came under the control of a Soviet-allied government which was supportive of black nationalist forces in both South Africa and Rhodesia. This created a delicate situation since Rhodesia's main road and rail links to the outside world were via the Mozambican ports of Beira and Maputo. Initially, the new Mozambican government allowed the Rhodesians <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> of these links. This was so even while ZANU guerrillas were allowed to base themselves in Tete province adjoining north eastern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Separately, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government {{announced}} on St. George's Day 2013 in a symbolic move that England's historic and traditional counties still exist. They are now recognised by the government, who will now encourage the marking and <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> of such traditional county names by the existing tiers {{of local government}} and residents. A follow up announcement in April 2014 put forward an initiative in changing planning regulations, stating that 'traditional county' names can be placed on roadsigns. The same Government department also published an online map comparing the current and historic counties. The {{main body of the}} pre-1889 boundaries appear to be acknowledged, but Worcestershire's islands including Dudley and Shipston-on-Stour are omitted.|$|E

5|$|The Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) {{justified}} the <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> of tolls by suggesting they {{were necessary to}} fund maintenance and improvement works. These included the construction of defences around the submerged piers forming the bases of the main towers {{in the event of}} collision in the Firth. The main towers were also strengthened with internal steel columns (the original tower structure was hollow) and had hydraulic rams jack up these sections to transfer a portion of the load to the new steelwork. Also, the vertical cables suspending the deck had their bolts replaced after a detected failure. A new paint system required development for the bridge (the original was phased out due to environmental concerns).|$|E
5|$|The {{ground was}} first {{constructed}} in 1905, soon before the club moved in. The club rented the ground until 1933, when newly appointed chairman Charles Jeyes organised {{the purchase of}} the stadium. The club retained ownership of the ground until February 1989, when the freehold was sold to Luton Borough Council for £3.25million. The club was granted a seven-year lease at peppercorn rent for its <b>continued</b> <b>use.</b> This arrangement has been extended several times, and as of 2015 is due to end in 2028.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} inquiry {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} future use of the pipelines, and took evidence from the various stakeholders, most of whom presented the case that favored their companies or industry. The inquiry concluded that the pipelines should be sold for <b>continued</b> <b>use</b> in transporting petroleum. An auction for the pipelines was announced in 1946, {{which was designed to}} give preference to bidders who intended to use them for moving petroleum. 16 bids were received, with the highest cash bidders being companies hoping to use the pipelines for natural gas. Assessing the different bids proved difficult and the discussions became enmeshed in national politics, with companies seeking support from various Washington politicians. Meanwhile, a threatened national coal strike raised concerns over the availability of natural gas, strengthening the arguments of the natural gas lobby.|$|E
