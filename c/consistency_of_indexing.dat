40|$|Little {{attention}} {{has previously been}} paid to the use of controlled vocabularies and subject keywords for indexing archival finding aids in the UK. Qualitative and quantitative responses to a questionnaire of UK repositories concerning the use of subject keywords and controlled vocabularies are presented. Clear patterns of thesaurus usage emerge from responses, and diverse opinions are put forward. Issues raised include retrieval by free text versus controlled vocabulary, strengths and weaknesses of different thesauri, lack of suitable thesauri, use of multiple thesauri, retrospective conversion, <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>indexing</b> across repositories and <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>indexing</b> across networks.

40|$|Abstract Objective – Systematic searching {{is central}} to {{guideline}} development, yet guidelines in social care present a challenge to systematic searching because they exist within a highly complex policy and service environment. The objective {{of this study was}} to highlight challenges and inform practice on identifying social care research literature, drawing on experiences from guideline development in social care. Methods – The researchers reflected on the approaches to searching for research evidence to inform three guidelines. They evaluated the utility of major topic-focused bibliographic database sources through a) determining the yield of citations from the search strategies for two guidelines and b) identifying which databases contain the citations for three guidelines. The researchers also considered the proportion of different study types and their presence in certain databases. Results – There were variations in the ability of the search terms to capture the studies from individual databases, even with low-precision searches. These were mitigated by searching a combination of databases and other resources that were specific to individual topics. A combination of eight databases was important for finding literature for the included topics. Multiple database searching also mitigates the currency of content, topic and study design focus, and <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>indexing</b> within individual databases. Conclusion – Systematic searching for research evidence in social care requires considerable thought and development so that the search is fit for the particular purpose of supporting guidelines. This study highlights key challenges and reveals trends when utilising some commonly used databases...|$|E

40|$|Rationale and ObjectivesDevelopment of imaging {{biomarkers}} often {{relies on}} their correlation with histopathology. Our {{aim was to}} compare two approaches for correlating pathology to multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (mpMRI) for localization and quantitative assessment of prostate cancer (PCa) index tumor using whole mount (WM) pathology (WMP) as the reference. Materials and MethodsPatients (N =  30) underwent mpMRI that included diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI at 3 T before radical prostatectomy (RP). RP specimens were processed using WM technique (WMP) and findings summarized in a standard surgical pathology report (SPR). Histology index tumor volumes (HTVs) were compared to MR tumor volumes (MRTVs) using two approaches for index lesion identification on mpMRI using annotated WMP slides as the reference (WMP) and using routine SPR as the reference. <b>Consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>index</b> tumor localization, tumor volume, and mean values of the derived quantitative parameters (mean apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC], Ktrans, and ve) were compared. ResultsIndex lesions from 16 of 30 patients met the selection criteria. There was WMP/SRP agreement in index tumor in 13 of 16 patients. ADC-based MRTVs were larger (P    0. 8; P < . 05). No significant differences were observed in the mean values of Ktrans and ADC between the WMP and SPR. ConclusionsWMP correlation is superior to SPR for accurate localization <b>of</b> all <b>index</b> lesions. The use of WMP is however not required to distinguish significant differences of mean values of quantitative MRI parameters within tumor volume...|$|R

30|$|Tunable {{consistency}} guarantees in {{big data}} stores help in achieving optimized consistency guarantees with improved performance. Commercial data stores offer tunable consistency guarantees at transaction level where the user specifies the desired level <b>of</b> <b>consistency</b> in terms <b>of</b> number of participating replicas in {{read and write}} consensus. Selective data consistency model applies strict consistency to a subset of data objects. The <b>consistency</b> guarantees <b>of</b> data attributes or objects are measured using an application independent metric called consistency index (CI). Our consistency model is predictive and helps in expression <b>of</b> data <b>consistency</b> {{as a function of}} known database design parameters, like workload characteristics and number of replicas of the data object. This work extends the causal relationships presented in our earlier work and presents adaptive <b>consistency</b> guarantees <b>of</b> this <b>consistency</b> model. The adaptive consistency guarantees are implemented with a consistency tuner, which probes the <b>consistency</b> <b>index</b> <b>of</b> an observed replicated data object in an online application. The tuner uses statistically derived threshold values of an optimum time gap, which, when padded in a workload stream, guarantees a desired value <b>of</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>index</b> for the observed data object. The tuner thus works like a workload scheduler of the replicated data object and pads only the required time delay between the requests {{in such a way that}} desired level <b>of</b> <b>consistency</b> is achieved with minimal effect on performance metrics like response time.|$|R

In particular, the obtained results allow us to determine the frequency at which observations should be taken {{in order to reach}} any pre-specified level of estimation precision.

A common application of {{quantitative methods}} in ethnobiology is to assess the traditional ecological knowledge of individuals. Few studies have addressed reliability <b>of</b> <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> traditional ecological knowledge constructed with different quantitative methods. Methods We assessed the associations among eight <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> traditional ecological knowledge from data collected from 650 native Amazonians.
