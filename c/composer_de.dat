He had a revolutionary influence on flamenco music both as a composer and otherwise. His influence on flamenco guitar has been compared with that of Andrés Segovia's on classical guitar. His album Fuente y Caudal (Fountain and Flow) has been cited by many to have changed the world of flamenco guitar beyond traditional flamenco culture. Along with Enrique Morente and Camarón de la Isla, de Lucía was the first artist to break away from traditional flamenco and form what is now known as nuevo flamenco. As a <b>composer,</b> <b>de</b> Lucía was the first Spanish artist to mix jazz with Andalusian music in a more or less systematic way. This includes, but is not limited to, his collaborations with Di Meola, McLaughlin, and Pedro Iturralde.|$|E

50|$|Maurice de Jong (born 5 September 1973), {{known by}} his moniker Mories, is a Dutch {{composer}} and musician. He is best recognized for his multiple music projects, namely Gnaw Their Tongues, Seirom, Aderlating, Cloak of Altering and De Magia Veterum. His compositions are informed by ambient music, black metal, drone music, electronic {{music and the}} avant-garde. His interests lie in invoking a disquieting and nightmarish atmosphere with his music, which often utilizes distortion and dissonance. Lauded as a most prolific <b>composer,</b> <b>de</b> Jong has recorded an upwards of three albums per year since 2007.|$|E

5000|$|And {{perhaps most}} significantly, in Contrapunctus 16 - {{actually}} two Fugues one normal and its pair in mirror inversion, the notes inégales are written {{out in a}} texture of running triplets, showing the varying value of the dot, {{as well as the}} varying [...] "swing" [...] of notes inégales. And it is of interest to note that in the keyboard arrangements of this work, the notes inégales are not written out, and this suggests strongly that the practice of notes inégales, of rhythmic alteration, was known to Bach and his circle. In his teens, Bach travelled and studied at the French modelled Court in Celle in southern Germany, where they had an orchestra modelled on the Concert Royal of Lully, during which time it is believed he studied and wrote compositions in the French Style, such as a five-part incomplete Fantasie and Fugue for organ, BWV 562, that is based exactly on the voicing, texture, and structure of the works of the French baroque <b>composer</b> <b>De</b> Grigny, and would make it eligible for notes inégales. His later work, the Fantasia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 537, also uses the same mostly 8th note texture, is written in the same time signature, features a similar texture, and responds well to the application of long-short notes inégales to the evenly notated 8th notes, and short-long to the slurred 8th note pairs, also typical and consistent to classic baroque French notes inégales procedures.|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} Johan de Meij’s UFO Concerto for Euphonium and Wind Orchestra based on the analytical method in Jan LaRue’s Guidelines for Style Analysis. The performance concerns of the soloist and issues of importance for the conductor are also discussed. Additionally, I provide insights garnered from interviews with the composer, the conductor of a premiere, and a soloist of a premiere. My own thoughts as a euphonium player and conductor also are included. An important observation I made {{was that of the}} recurring de Meij Chord/Gamelan Chord and Introductory Theme/Gamelan Theme, which are prevalent through much of the piece. This chord structure was used also in de Meij’s, Extreme Make-Over and Planet Earth. <b>Composer</b> <b>de</b> Meij and soloist Adam Frey both stated that the concerto’s form is through-composed. In my analysis, however, I identified the form as a quasi sonata-allegro form as explained in Chapter III. This piece is challenging for soloists because of its range, awkward fingering combinations/articulations, its multi rhythmic layers, and its length. Frey compared the UFO Concerto to several works that have become standard for solo euphonium and band. However, he notes that the ensemble for the UFO Concerto is given the task to play many of the same passages that also were written for the soloist. My discoveries concerning conducting issues include the need for the conductor to prepare the ensemble, as well as communicate with the soloist, because of some inherent musical liberties and intricate musical moments found in the piece. Based on the interview with Richard Good and my personal findings, this study confirms that a conductor must pay special attention to proper balance and the rhythmic challenges created by de Meij. An interview with Johan de Meij, the composer, explored the motivation, compositional background, and highlights of the piece that were not explicit in his program notes. De Meij also discussed his views on identification of the themes and the Gamelan Chord that was central to much of this five-movement work. Richard Good, a conductor who premiered the work, provided insight on conducting this concerto, especially regarding collaboration with the soloists. An interview with Adam Frey, who performed in the Asian premiere of the UFO Concerto, touched on aspects of preparation and on collaboration challenges. Transcripts of these focused interviews are found in Appendices B, C, and D. An important addition to this study is my list based on Adam Frey’s “Music for Euphonium and Wind Band,” found in the Guide to Euphonium Repertoire: The Euphonium Source Book. Appendix A lists original works for Euphonium and Wind Band written between 2007 and 2014. This list helps to place the UFO Concerto in the wider historical context of the euphonium repertoire.
