25|$|The Aegean Sea <b>catchment</b> <b>basin</b> drains the Thracian Plain {{and most}} of the higher lands to the south and southwest. Several major rivers flow {{directly}} to the Aegean Sea. Most of these streams fall swiftly from the mountains and have cut deep, scenic gorges. The 480km–long Maritsa (of them 321km in Bulgaria) and its tributaries drain all of the western Thracian Plain, all of Sredna Gora, the southern slopes of the Balkan Mountains, and the northern slopes of the eastern Rhodopes. After it leaves Bulgaria, the Maritsa forms most of the Greco-Turkish border. Maritsa's major tributaries are the Tundzha, Arda, Topolnitsa, Vacha, etc. The other Bulgarian rivers flowing directly to the Aegean are the Struma and the Mesta.|$|E

500|$|The area {{exhibits}} karst morphology, with bedrock largely {{consisting of}} limestones and comparatively small areas of dolomites and Quaternary sediments. Eocene flysch forms the southwest {{boundary of the}} catchment area, towards which the <b>catchment</b> <b>basin</b> drains and where the Ombla rises. The rocks were formed as a thick series of carbonate sediments were deposited between the Norian and Late Cretaceous as the Adriatic Carbonate Platform, up to [...] deep. In the Eocene and early Oligocene, the Adriatic Plate moved north and north-east, contributing to the Alpine orogeny via the tectonic uplift of the Dinarides. The basin's karst topography developed from the carbonate platform's exposure to weathering. Karstification largely began after the Dinarides' final uplift in the Oligocene and the Miocene, when the carbonates were exposed to atmospheric effects; this extended {{to the level of}} [...] below the present sea level, exposed during the Last Glacial Maximum. Some karst formations were created during earlier sea level drops, most notably the Messinian salinity crisis. The geological structure of the area indicates recent tectonic activity in the catchment, with a fault running between Hum and the Ombla. A recent strong earthquake in the wider region was the 1979 Montenegro earthquake, measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale. The only strong historical earthquake in the immediate area was the 1667 Dubrovnik earthquake, which was followed by a tsunami.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the behavior}} of extreme events of surface precipitation and temperature inside the Pacific and Caribbean <b>Catchment</b> <b>Basins</b> in Colombia using several datasets such as observations, reconstructed data, NCEP-NCAR and ERA- 40 reanalyses and data from the regional model REMO. We use an extreme value method that selects the time series excesses over a nonstationary threshold and adjusts them to a generalized Pareto distribution. The goodness of fit is evaluated through a test that includes the Cramer-von Mises, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling statistics and the p values generated by parametric bootstrap resampling. The test not only evaluates the goodness of fit but also the threshold choice. The parameters are presented in maps that allow recognition {{of the features of}} the extreme behaviour inside the <b>catchment</b> <b>basins,</b> and differences and similarities between them. Maps of return periods for the maximum extreme events are also presented. A strong influence of the El Niño-Southern oscillation on the extreme events of both temperature and precipitation is found in the two <b>catchment</b> <b>basins.</b> © 2012 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This work {{addresses}} a <b>catchment</b> <b>basins</b> merging algorithm developed to automatize the segmentation of ceramical images. The proposed algorithm, {{which is a}} modification of the watershed algorithm, employs two parameters to control the <b>catchment</b> <b>basins</b> merging: a depth criterium and an area criterium. This solution suppresses the characteristic over-segmentation of the flooding simulation algorithms enabling the direct image segmentation. There is no need of a previous pre-processing step. It is shown that this solution produces excellent segmentation results. Introduction. Many microscopic images show a microstructure composed of individual regions separated by thin gaps. Such characteristics {{can be observed in}} some ceramic materials, as uranium oxides, in biological samples, lik...|$|R

2500|$|Holderness Drainage were {{responsible}} for the management of the system until 1930, when the Land Drainage Act 1930 became law. This organised the low-lying areas of England and Wales into Catchement Areas, each with its own Catchment Board. These boards {{were responsible}} for the main rivers within a <b>catchment</b> <b>basin.</b> [...] For the Holderness region, responsibility for the River Hull and the Holderness main drain passed to the Hull Catchment Board. Holderness Drainage then became an Internal Drainage Board (IDB), with responsibility for the smaller drains. Responsibility changed again with the passing of the River Boards Act 1948, which created the Hull and East Yorkshire River Board. The next change occurred {{as a result of the}} Water Resources Act 1963, when the Hull River Board was joined to the Yorkshire Ouse River Board to become the Yorkshire Ouse and Hull River Authority. Further amalgamation and reorganisation took place following the passing of the Water Act 1973, when the River Authority became part of the much larger Yorkshire Water Authority. Yorkshire Water Authority was privatised as a result of the Water Act 1989, and responsibility for main rivers including the Holderness Drain passed to the National Rivers Authority, which subsequently became part of the Environment Agency in 1995.|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on the watershed is separated in two families: the watersheds on node weighted graphs and the watersheds on edge weighted graphs. The simplest node weighted graphs are images, where the nodes are the pixels; neighboring pixels being linked by unweighted pixels. The edge weights on an edge weighted graph express dissimilarities between the unweighted nodes. Distinct definitions of minima and <b>catchment</b> <b>basins</b> have been given for both types of graphs from which different algorithms have been derived. This paper aims at showing that watersheds on edge or node weighted graphs are strictly equivalent. Moreover, all algorithms developed for edge weighted graphs may be applied on node weighted graphs and vice versa. From any node or edge weighted graph {{it is possible to}} derive a flooding graph with node and edge weights. Its regional minima and <b>catchment</b> <b>basins</b> are identical whether one considers the node weights alone or the edge weights alone. A lexicographic order relation permits to compare non ascending paths with the same origin according to their steepness. Overlapping zones between neighboring <b>catchment</b> <b>basins</b> are reduced or even suppressed by pruning edges in the flooding graph through which does not pass a steepest path and reduces, without arbitrary choices the overlapping zones between adjacent <b>catchment</b> <b>basins.</b> We propose several ways to break the remaining ties, the simplest being to assign slightly distinct weights to regional minima with the same weight. Like that each node is linked with only one regional minimum by a path of maximal steepness...|$|R

50|$|The Guzman Water Catchment is a {{historic}} private water supply structure in the rural Nalao area of the village of Barrigada in the United States territory of Guam. It is a roughly rectangular structure, measuring 4.4 x 2.84 x 1.52 m, with an open top. It is fashioned out of locally gathered stone joined with lime-cement mortar. It was built in 1910 by Baldobino Charfauros on family-owned land, {{and is one of}} the oldest surviving rural <b>catchment</b> <b>basins</b> on the island. It is further distinguished from other <b>catchment</b> <b>basins</b> in that it has a substantial floor.

30|$|A known {{problem of}} the {{watershed}} method is over-segmentation. The presence of {{a huge number of}} local minima - for example due to random particle noise or transient gas density fluctuations - causes segmentation into as many <b>catchment</b> <b>basins</b> as there are local minima. Generally speaking, there are two possible strategies to deal with this problem: not creating the over-segmentation in the first place or merging over-segmented regions. Preventing over-segmentation the can be obtained using markers to preselect allowed minima (e.g., Moga and Gabbouj 1998). This usually requires a human intervention, which in our case is not possible. Another way is to use the so-called hierarchical watershed algorithm 3 (Beucher 1994). Hierarchical watershed algorithms merge artificial <b>catchment</b> <b>basins</b> to more important ones based on some criteria. What we will describe in the following turns our watershed algorithm into a hierarchical algorithm in the Beucher (1994) sense.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a solution to}} a major drawback of watershed transformation: over segmentation. The solution utilizes one of its main advantages – very good edge extraction. It is a method that simulates pouring water onto a landscape created on a basis of a digital image. Unfortunately transformation produces a region for each local minimum so, usually, the number of watersheds (<b>catchment</b> <b>basins)</b> is too big. Watershed region growing {{is based on a}} minimum variance region growing algorithm [1 - 3]. It differs from the original in that it grows a homogenous region by adding and removing entire watersheds (<b>catchment</b> <b>basins)</b> and not separate pixels. The generalized watershed based region dilation and contraction are presented. Thanks to the use of watershed transformation, the region growing process is not able to grow a region easily outside the object boundaries. Test segmentations of two class images and a comparison between the minimum variance and the watershed based region growing are presented. 1...|$|R
