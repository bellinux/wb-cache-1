40|$|AbstractClassroom {{interaction}} {{takes an}} important {{place in the}} process of Second Language Acquisition (SLA) and is perceived to promote learners’ processing capacity (Walsh, 2002; Matsumoto, 2010). Since interaction is in the heart of communication in an era of communicative language teaching (Brown, 2007), teachers {{need to be aware of}} to what extent their <b>classroom</b> <b>practices</b> facilitate <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> in reality. Therefore, this paper attempts to unveil the relationship between teachers’ beliefs about classroom interaction and their actual practices. The findings of the study indicated contradiction between teachers’ beliefs and their actual practices which will be discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from primary to secondary school {{is an area}} of concern across a range of curriculum subjects, and this is no less so for foreign <b>language</b> <b>learning.</b> Indeed problems with transition have been identified in England as an important barrier to the introduction of <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> to the primary school curriculum, with implications for learners’ longer-term motivation for the subject. This longitudinal study investigated, through a questionnaire, the development of 233 learners’ motivation for learning French in England, during the {{transition from}} primary to secondary schooling. It also explored whether levels and patterns of motivation differed according to the type of language teaching experienced, comparing a largely oracy-focused approach with one with greater emphasis on literacy activities. Learners showed high and increasing levels of motivation across transition, placing particular value on learning French for travel. Being taught through an oracy or a literacy-focused approach had less impact on learners’ motivation than broader classroom experiences, with the development of a sense of progress and feeling that instruction met their learning needs being especially important. A growing disjuncture emerged between valuing the learning of French for travel/communication and learners’ low levels of self-efficacy for communication with native speakers, together with a desire for more communication-based activities. By {{the end of the first}} year of secondary school less positive attitudes towards learning French and less optimism about the possibility of future progress were beginning to emerge. The paper concludes by outlining the implications of the study for <b>classroom</b> <b>practice</b> in <b>language</b> <b>learning...</b>|$|R
40|$|Information {{about current}} {{spelling}} instructional practices across the United States was sought in this national sur-vey with {{a random sample}} of teachers of grades 1 through 5. Respondents reported current practices and noted their level of agreement or disagreement to theoretical statements about spelling. Teachers responded to open-ended statements regarding concerns and problems they encounter in teaching spelling. The results suggest teachers rely on a traditional model for instruction. They are aware of more recent research on developmentally appropriate practice but do not neces-sarily implement those ideas. Implications from this study include provision for professional development, examination of purchased materials in relation to theories of appropriate individual instruction, and support for teachers who want to change instruction to match their beliefs. In recent years, the teaching of spelling has gained increased attention. The impression that students are poorer spellers seems to stem from the demand for more self-generated writing (Templeton & Morris, 1999). Now that reading and writing classrooms have moved out of the “fill in the blank ” mode, the very vis-ible skill of spelling has come under scrutiny. Histori-cally, skill in spelling was thought to rely on an ability to memorize. Research has shown that, “while memory does {{play an important role in}} learning to spell, ” it is not the only strategy employed in the process (Templeton & Morris, 1999, p. 102). As the research community con-tinues to analyze how one becomes an efficient speller, varying viewpoints exist regarding how to best instruct. Many teachers have changed their <b>classroom</b> <b>practices</b> to integrate <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> into literacy instructio...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the relationship between <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> strategies and <b>practices</b> of the students of private school. Survey Instruments included the dependent and independent variables of gender, age, form and level. About 60 students (n= 60) responded to a survey instrument. Likert scale was used as data collection strategies. Quantitative data analyzed quantitatively through SPSS. The convenience sampling technique was used to collect data because of the time and cost constraints. Participants were the students of 5 different forms. The instrument used in the study contained 50 items with closed ended responses which was previously pilot tested with many other reviewers to establish content validity. Survey information was obtained through the use of questionnaire and all responses remained confidential. Generally, the survey results indicate that students did not use <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> strategies regularly and completely.

40|$|Justifications for {{promoting}} learner autonomy in <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> are manifold. As teachers have {{a central role}} in developing learner autonomy and given the influence teachers’ beliefs have on their practices (Borg, 2006), it is essential to gain insight into their views regarding learner autonomy (Borg & Al-Busaidi, 2012). Similarly, learners’ perceptions concerning <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> influence their openness to the ideas presented in the language classroom (Cottera ll, 1995). Furthermore, as mismatches between teachers’ and students’ beliefs could {{have a negative impact on}} learners’ motivation, understanding the relationship between teachers’ and students’ beliefs might lead to more successful learning. The present study explored language teachers’ and learners’ beliefs and <b>classroom</b> <b>practices</b> concerning learner autonomy in a Hungarian secondary school. Mixed methods were used: attitude-questionnaires and interviews revealed what language teachers (n= 9) understood by learner autonomy and in what ways they claimed that they incorporated it in their practice. The study also looked into language learners’ beliefs (n= 100) and reported autonomous behaviours. A questionnaire explored to what extent students felt responsible for their autonomy in <b>language</b> <b>learning.</b> Furthermore, classroom observations helped to gain insight into teachers’ <b>classroom</b> <b>practices</b> and <b>language</b> learners’ autonomous behaviours. Finally, the study revealed correspondences and mismatches between teachers’ and students’ autonomous beliefs. The findings of the study have pedagogical implications for practicing teachers and teacher educators as their awareness should be raised about the importance of learner autonomy to help them shape their learners’ learning experiences positively regarding autonomy development...|$|R

The {{sample consisted of}} 16 pre-service teachers: 6 males and 10 females. Data collection methods included focus groups interviews, in-depth semi-structured individual interviews and critical reflective documents. Interpretation of data indicated that participants experienced {{a wide range of}} positive and negative emotions, mainly focused around areas related to their <b>classroom</b> <b>practices,</b> <b>language</b> proficiency, professional knowledge and support received during their practicum. Challenges faced emerged within the same context and indicated the need for a reorganization of the teaching education programme and a clarification of the roles and responsibilities held by the stakeholders involved in the practicum (i. e. student teacher, college supervisor, school principal and class mentor). The coping strategies utilized showed that participants employed few positive effective approaches, whereas passivity, in reactions to the challenges encountered, shaped most of the other strategies used. This passivity in responding to practicum challenges necessitates the development of student teachers’ interpersonal and emotional intelligence skills. The findings also show an urgent need for more coordination and collaboration between the college and the schools of training. This study, being {{the first of its kind}} in the Gulf region and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), contributes to a better understanding of student teachers’ emotions during the practicum and highlights areas which need reconsideration by policy makers, educators and curriculum designers at the micro and macro levels of teacher education programmes...|$|R

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} exists concerning teaching students of Mexican background whose primary language is not English, who I call Potentially Biliterate Students (PBLs) in this study. The focus of the research around these students often addresses bilingual education, academic achievement, the impact of language policy, and segregation, among other areas. Yet inequalities still prevail when educating this group of students. Language policies such as Proposition 203 and House Bill 2064 in Arizona, which are not research-based, target this particular population -perpetuating inequalities that have been visible since the Mexican-American War of 1848. This dissertation is informed by sociocultural (Vygotsky, 1978) and sociocultural-historical (Rogoff, 2003) perspectives. Theories of second language (Krashen, 1982; Cummins, 1991; Collier, 1995) and the interplay with mathematics education (Moschkovich, 2002, Khisty, 1995) are also important components that frame my study. This study took place in two different third-grade classrooms, a mainstream and an English Language Development/Structured English Immersion (ELD/SEI), in an English-only environment. The school {{is part of a}} school district in southern Arizona where most students are of Mexican background. I employed ethnographic tools to address my research questions. The data sources of this study come from field notes from participant observations, video-recorded sessions, interviews (video- and/or audio recorded) with both teachers and students, and teachers autobiographies regarding their <b>language</b> and mathematics <b>learning</b> experiences, offering a rich source for analysis of the resources and <b>classroom</b> <b>practices</b> in the teaching-learning environment. This data allowed me to develop in-depth case studies for both teachers based on the nature of their classrooms. Thought the two case studies presented, I document how the sociopolitical-historical context and the teachers' training and professional development shape their <b>classroom</b> <b>practices,</b> <b>language</b> ideology, attitudes towards the subjects they teach, as well as their perceptions about their students and families; in particular around students of Mexican background. Additional research is needed to connect results similar to this study with the impact on students' outcomes and behavior, as also the impact on participation of the different school members -parents and other community members...|$|R

40|$|This article embraces an {{examination}} of certain dedicated terms within technology education that children may encounter {{as part of their}} primary school experience. Four language-related issues are explored. The first of these concerns the difficulty that may be experienced in defining certain technological terms. The second concerns the ways in which primary school children use their own versions of terminology to describe specific artifacts and functions. The third issue concerns the role of some manufacturers and publishers in employing inappropriate terminology within educational products. The final issue revolves around the psycho-social development of language in young children and the contribution this may make to the acquisition of appropriate technical terms. These issues are woven together to form a complex linguistic tapestry with implications for <b>classroom</b> <b>practice.</b> <b>Language,</b> when seen as the instrument of communication used by the speech community (Labov, 1994), provides the basic platform for the communication of ideas. Our language is packaged into words. These convenient vocal units express culturally-derived fragments of meaning, and indeed it seems that we all have an intuitive grasp of what constitutes a word as a distinct unit within our own language (Langacker, 1972). The use of the term "word" is qualified with culture, since it is the sharing of the meaning of our words in prescribed cultural settings that enables us to sustain the building blocks of our language. As Pinker (1994) said, "A word is the quintessential symbol. Its power {{comes from the fact that}} every member of a linguistic community uses it interchangeably in speaking and understanding [...] . Words [...] . are a universal currency within a community" (p. 151). Within the community of the primary [...] ...|$|R

The study also looked into language learners’ beliefs and reported autonomous behaviours involving all the 9 th graders (n= 100) from the school. Students’ questionnaire explored to what extent students felt responsible to influence their autonomy in <b>language</b> <b>learning.</b> Furthermore, classroom observations helped me gain insight into <b>language</b> teachers’ <b>classroom</b> <b>practices</b> and <b>language</b> learners’ autonomous behaviours. Finally, the study revealed correspondences and mismatches between teachers’ and students’ autonomous beliefs. The results showed that although learner autonomy was listed among the stated educational aims in the curriculum, and teachers’ attitudes towards autonomy was positive, their beliefs did not translate into practice. Teachers’ attitudes towards autonomy seem to be strongly connected to their own learning experiences and influence their practices concerning autonomy support. Teachers believed that their students had low levels of autonomy, which coincided with students’ views about themselves, who did not view their school as a space to develop their autonomy as language learners. The findings of the research carry pedagogical implications to practicing teachers and teacher educators as teachers’ awareness should be raised about the importance of learner autonomy to help teachers shape their learners’ learning experiences positively regarding autonomy development...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to contribute}} towards {{research in the area}} of Second <b>Language</b> <b>Learning</b> and Teaching, with particular focus on English Second <b>Language</b> (ESL) <b>Learning</b> and Teaching in the context of a South African distance college. This report investigates the notion of 'best practice' in language classrooms and compares this notion with a sample of teachers' own views about what constitutes 'best practice' in language teaching. Included in this report are critical discussions regarding language teacher education and the pervasive influence of different language policies in South Africa with regard to the way such policies have influenced teachers' beliefs about their practice. There is also a focus on the debate surrounding the prescription of a single 'best practice' in teacher education. The investigative approach used in this research was essentially qualitative and this report includes details on the benefits and challenges of the narrative task as a research tool, as well as much authentic material in the form of student responses. This investigation found that while many teachers do support practices which are in keeping with official notions of 'best practice' as described in the South African language-in-education policy and Curriculum 2005, there are significant numbers of teachers who advocate <b>practices</b> for <b>language</b> teaching which seem to contradict the notion of 'best practice' including Subtractive Bilingualism, Audiolingual methodology, rote learning and even coersion.

40|$|Recently, {{the field}} of second {{language}} acquisition (SLA) has seen the growing impact of social context on second <b>language</b> <b>learning,</b> which has been called by Block a “social turn ” (2003). This increasing interest in social context and SLA {{has resulted in a}} need to theorize two notions, “social ” and “context, ” which have been defined differently across language-related fields. Similarly, the concept of “discursive practice ” has started to appear more. Yet, despite its frequent use, this latter term has not been explored in detail. Discursive <b>Practice</b> in <b>Language</b> <b>Learning</b> and Teaching, the sixth volume in the <b>Language</b> <b>Learning</b> monograph series, fills this gap by unpacking and analyzing these key concepts.

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION OF Rania Hassan Talafhah, for the Doctor of Philosophy {{degree in}} Curriculum and Instruction, {{presented}} on 4 May 2017, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNING: JORDANIAN EFL LEARNERS’ PRACTICES AND EXPERIENCES MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Christina C. McIntyre The {{purpose of this}} mixed-methods sequential explanatory {{study was to identify}} the EFL learners’ practices and understand their experiences with SNSs (social networking sites) as a tool for English <b>language</b> <b>learning.</b> The study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, quantitative results were obtained from a survey of 144 undergraduate Jordanian EFL learners in the English and Translation Departments at Yarmouk University in Jordan. In the second phase, richer information and a deeper insight was gained through a qualitative case study. In the quantitative phase of the study, the research questions focused on the actual practices and strategies of EFL students on SNSs. In the qualitative phase, 12 participants were purposefully selected and interviewed in order to explain further the statistical results of the first phase, develop a rich descriptive picture of their lived experiences using social networking to improve their English <b>language</b> <b>learning,</b> and identify the factors and barriers that influence their practices. This study was guided by the following research questions: 1. To what extent do Jordanian EFL learners use Facebook as a tool for <b>language</b> <b>learning?</b> 2. What <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> <b>practices</b> do Jordanian EFL learners engage in on Facebook? 3. How do these Facebook <b>practices</b> affect their <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> experiences? The results revealed that most participants felt comfortable using Facebook in English <b>language</b> <b>learning.</b> However, less than half of them used Facebook on a regular basis to learn English. In addition, they tended to read and observe discussions in English rather than participate in them or produce language output. The results also revealed that learners’ practices or behaviors in the SNS environment changed depending on certain factors, such as the context, audience, sense of belonging, self – confidence, and the learners’ needs and interests. The results of the study brought to light some implications in the context of formal and informal <b>language</b> <b>learning.</b> The study might raise learner, teacher, and educator awareness about SNSs as a tool for <b>language</b> <b>learning,</b> particularly for countries with limited resources. The results also showed the need for a theoretical and pedagogical framework for the teaching and learning process that identifies the best practices and ways to avoid any harm in a SNS environment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{multiple}} case {{study was to examine}} whether teachers’ beliefs about EFL Learning Strategies were reflected in their actual <b>classroom</b> <b>practices.</b> There were seven teachers who participated in this research. One of the data gathering instruments in this case study was a questionnaire that inquires the participants beliefs about EFL Learning Strategies (BALLI and SILL) to the <b>classroom</b> <b>practices</b> and how these beliefs influence their <b>classroom</b> <b>practices</b> in Primary, Junior High as well as Senior High education. In addition to the questionnaire, semi structured interviews with participants were held to examine their beliefs in detail. Finally, in order to see whether participants’ beliefs matched with their actual <b>practices</b> in their <b>classrooms</b> <b>practices,</b> the participants were observed and video-recorded for triangulation for the data. Three sessions classroom observations of the courses as well as video recordings of those courses were also examined by the researcher. O’Malleys <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> strategies scheme was used to classify the transcript of classroom video recordings. The result of the analysis of participants’ responses to the questionnaire, video-recorded classroom observations and interviews were presented qualitatively in the findings section. The results showed that all of the seven teachers beliefs about EFL Learning strategies were uniquely reflected in their <b>classroom</b> <b>practices</b> suitable to their experience in acquiring and applying LLS in learning English. Moreover, the finding shows that teachers beliefs were interrelated and strengthened by the experience of applying LLS in their <b>classroom</b> <b>practices.</b> Key words: 	Teacher’s beliefs about <b>language</b> <b>learning,</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Learning</b> Strategies, multiple case study...|$|R

40|$|<b>Language</b> <b>learning</b> is {{changing}} in a mobile technology-rich landscape {{and under the}} influence of new learner practices stemming from personal perspectives on the best places for learning and from evolving uses of available time. The key aim of this chapter is to conceptualize the relation between the focus of <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> and the dimensions of time and place. What if <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> were to be defined by time and place? What would change? The chapter aims to assess what effect this might have on <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> in terms of curriculum or the design of learning activities. It draws on a series of studies led by the author, investigating how university students and other learners use mobile technologies to support their learning, and particularly on interview data from the most recent project which has focused on learners’ experiences with the use of mobile devices to support <b>language</b> <b>learning.</b> Learning activities undertaken by the interviewees were wide-ranging, with evidence of the importance of both easy learning and challenge. Specific findings relating to time and place of learning are reported. As mobile technology developments and the availability of mobile services and applications accelerate, educators and researchers need conceptual frameworks to enable them to interpret emerging learner <b>practices.</b> New <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> activities and services can be designed {{on the basis of this}} understanding. By reviewing individual learner experiences in learner-determined contexts, researchers and the language teaching community can work together to build up a picture of emergent practices and formulate the implications for the design of <b>language</b> teaching and <b>learning</b> now and in the future...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experiment on syntax priming in an e-mail tandem <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> environment. Twenty-two subjects participated in the completion of 6 tasks in pairs. Subject-pairs working together on tasks consisted of a native speaker of Spanish learning English and a native speaker of English learning Spanish. Bilingual asynchronous written communication between pair members took place through a system we had designed for research into learner-language in interaction. The results of this experiment inform the practice of e-mail tandem exchanges addressing the following questions: a) is there evidence of syntax priming in transcripts of e-mail tandem exchanges? If so, can we link syntax priming to second <b>language</b> <b>learning?</b> b) how do we integrate these results into the <b>practice</b> of tandem <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> and the design of systems that support this type of <b>language</b> <b>learning</b> over the Internet? # The authors both gratefully acknowledge financial support for this research from the Centre for Language and Communication Studies at Trinity College...|$|R
