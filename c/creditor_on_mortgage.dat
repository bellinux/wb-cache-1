40|$|Lender losses <b>on</b> <b>mortgage</b> loans {{arise from}} a {{two-stage}} process. In the first stage, the borrower stops making payments {{if and when}} default is optimal. The second stage is a lengthy and costly period during which the lender employs legal remedies to obtain possession and execute a sale of the collateral. This research uses data <b>on</b> subprime <b>mortgage</b> losses to explore the role of borrower and collateral characteristics, and local legal requirements, as well as traditional option variables in the decisions of borrowers and lenders. Although subprime borrowers default earlier, which should reduce lender losses, these borrowers, nevertheless, impose greater realized losses <b>on</b> <b>mortgage</b> lenders.

Research <b>on</b> <b>mortgage</b> costs Susan E Woodward (2003) studied complete mortgage terms—loan rate plus lender/broker upfront charges, the YSP, and charges for other settlement services. She investigated the relation between the origination charges that borrowers pay directly and those they pay indirectly through the YSP, finding that a dollar of added YSP is associated with only a 55 -cent decline in direct charges. This finding suggests that borrowers may not be aware that a higher mortgage interest rate puts cash in the broker’s pocket that the borrower should be able to extract from the broker by insisting on a lower direct origination charge. Another finding in Woodward’s study was that borrowers who rolled all closin...|$|R
