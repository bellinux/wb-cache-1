She asked for a DNA test on the remains, but experts {{believed}} that there was little <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> any trace.|$|E
25|$|Using {{circulating}} tumor DNA {{as opposed}} to solid tumor biopsies allows analysis of the full repertoire of tumor cells dispersed throughout the tumor and distant metastasis. Therefore, {{there is a better}} <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> all mutations associated with this cancer. Having a full overview of the cancer and what is driving it will allow for better treatment plans and management of disease.|$|E
25|$|When used {{to detect}} whether a {{difference}} exists between groups, a paradox arises. As improvements are made to experimental design (e.g., increased precision of measurement and sample size), the test becomes more lenient. Unless one accepts the absurd assumption that all sources of noise in the data cancel out completely, the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> statistical significance in either direction approaches 100%.|$|E

25|$|The {{likelihood}} {{of success in}} a directed evolution experiment {{is directly related to}} the total library size, as evaluating more mutants increases the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> one with the desired properties.|$|R
30|$|Gross hourly wages {{turn out}} to be {{significantly}} lower for graduates from narrow education programmes than for graduates from broad programmes. In this case, the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> a job within the programme’s occupational domain and at the appropriate level appear to play a role. These chances have a significantly positive effect on wage levels. We find, however, that graduates from narrow education programmes have lower <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> a job in the programme’s domain and consequently at the programme’s level. Both aspects therefore {{have a negative effect on}} the hourly wage level of graduates from narrow education programmes.|$|R
25|$|Back at Carlisle, King Arthur learns of {{the events}} and pardons the {{defeated}} king. Arthur decides personally to set out in search of Fergus, but Gawain counsels {{that he has a}} better <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> him if he hosts a tournament. The tournament is arranged at Jedburgh, and the prize is Queen Galiene and her kingdom. During the week-long tournament, Fergus remains invincible, defeating, among others, Kay, Lancelot and the Black Knight. It is after this that Fergus and Galiene are united in marriage, and Fergus becomes King of Lothian.|$|E
25|$|The XOR metric allows Kademlia {{to extend}} routing tables beyond single bits. Groups of bits {{can be placed}} in k-buckets. The group of bits are termed a prefix. For an m-bit prefix, there will be 2m-1 k-buckets. The missing k-bucket is a further {{extension}} of the routing tree that contains the node ID. An m-bit prefix reduces {{the maximum number of}} lookups from log2 n to log2m n. These are maximum values and the average value will be far less, increasing the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> a node in a k-bucket that shares more bits than just the prefix with the target key.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} physics, when a ball is rolled {{slowly up}} a large hill, it will {{come to a stop}} and roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy to get {{over the top of the}} hill to the other side. However, the Schrödinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get to the other side of the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called quantum tunneling. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> it on the other side.|$|E

25|$|Boltzmann {{accomplished}} the feat of {{showing that the}} second law of thermodynamics is only a statistical fact. The gradual disordering of energy {{is analogous to the}} disordering of an initially ordered pack of cards under repeated shuffling, and just as the cards will finally return to their original order if shuffled a gigantic number of times, so the entire universe must some-day regain, by pure chance, the state from which it first set out. (This optimistic coda to the idea of the dying universe becomes somewhat muted when one attempts to estimate the timeline which will probably elapse before it spontaneously occurs.) The tendency for entropy increase seems to cause difficulty to beginners in thermodynamics, but is easy to understand {{from the standpoint of the}} theory of probability. Consider two ordinary dice, with both sixes face up. After the dice are shaken, the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> these two sixes face up is small (1 in 36); thus one can say that the random motion (the agitation) of the dice, like the chaotic collisions of molecules because of thermal energy, causes the less probable state to change to one that is more probable. With millions of dice, like the millions of atoms involved in thermodynamic calculations, the probability of their all being sixes becomes so vanishingly small that the system must move to one of the more probable states. However, mathematically the odds of all the dice results not being a pair sixes is also as hard as the ones of all of them being sixes, and since statistically the data tend to balance, one in every 36 pairs of dice will tend to be a pair of sixes, and the cards -when shuffled- will sometimes present a certain temporary sequence order even if in its whole the deck was disordered.|$|E

500|$|In {{the midway}} station, Colonel Carter (Amanda Tapping) and Bill Lee (Bill Dow) are {{contacted}} by the Apollo, informing them Atlantis did not arrive. Carter and Lee eventually decide to find the city by using the Apollo to perform small jumps along the city's path and augment their sensors to increase the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> Atlantis. Dr. Keller (Jewel Staite) exhausts her medical expertise to save Weir, and asks McKay to reprogramme the nanites Weir was infected with in [...] "The Real World". Against Sheppard's orders, McKay goes ahead with it.|$|E

500|$|The {{first day}} of searching {{continued}} overnight. During {{the first two days}} of the search, vessels crisscrossed [...] of ocean. Secretary of the Army Elvis Stahr told newspapers that [...] "e have not given up hope that it will be found and that those aboard are safe," [...] and that a [...] "maximum effort" [...] was being made. After four days of searching, Major General Theodore R. Milton of the 13th Air Force told newspapers that although the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> survivors was doubtful, every effort would be made [...] "as long as there is any hope at all." ...|$|E
500|$|At age 30 (the {{minimum age}} {{required}} {{to hold the}} office), Biden became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history, and one of only 18 senators who took office before reaching the age of 31. But the accident left him filled with both anger and religious doubt: [...] "I liked to [...] at night when I {{thought there was a}} better <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> a fight ... I had not known I was capable of such rage ... I felt God had played a horrible trick on me." [...] To be at home every day for his young sons, Biden began the practice of commuting every day by Amtrak train for 1½ hours each way from his home in the Wilmington suburbs to Washington, D.C., which he continued to do throughout his Senate career. [...] In the aftermath of the accident, he had trouble focusing on work, and appeared to just go through the motions of being a senator. In his memoirs, Biden notes that staffers were taking bets on how long he would last. [...] A single father for five years, he left standing orders that he be interrupted in the Senate at any time if his sons called. [...] In remembrance of his wife and daughter, Biden does not work on December 18, the anniversary of the accident.|$|E
2500|$|Characters that don't {{participate}} {{directly in}} combat usually offer other {{services to the}} Prince, such as running a shop, giving clues for potential recruits, or aiding in the strategic war battles. [...] Additionally, up to four characters may be kept in reserve of the current party; some non-combat characters, when in the reserve, offer minor benefits such as healing after battle or a greater <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> a special item after battle.|$|E
30|$|Finally, we {{restricted}} {{ourselves to}} Web of Science searches using the AND or NOT search functions as described above.

50|$|An {{incident}} {{happened in}} 2000, involving {{a boy named}} Yu Man-Hon (Chinese name: 庾文翰), who was mentally disabled. He was missing at the Lo Wu boundary control point. The controversy arose when the fifteen-year-old ran across the boundary control point, without any identification. In the confusion, and {{due to the lack}} of understanding by border officers on both sides, he was mistakenly released into mainland China and has not been heard from since. The officials were criticised for a lack of awareness and for failure to recognise Yu's mental disability, letting him free to roam in an unfamiliar place. His parents are still searching for him; as the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> him are diminishing, <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> him are unlikely.|$|R

2500|$|TSR {{launched}} Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD) in 1977 to 1979. [...] This ambitious project {{expanded the}} rules to a small library of hardcover books.

2500|$|After a {{hiatus of}} several months, {{caused by the}} above controversy, Spielrein and Jung resumed their {{relationship}} {{in the summer of}} 1909, and continued seeing each other privately up through the last months of 1910. Spielrein permanently departed Zurich around January 1911. In Spielrein's private diary entry dated 11 September 1910—just four months before graduating from medical school, and leaving both Jung and Zürich—she mused again upon her fantasy of bearing Jung’s son.

2500|$|The weather conditions, three-metre {{waves and}} snow, made the rescue {{operation}} difficult. As {{the search for}} survivors resumed on the following day, {{five members of the}} 24-person crew had been confirmed dead and six were still missing. Thirteen crew members, including the ship's Polish captain, were winched to safety from liferafts by helicopters or picked up by nearby ships. According to Netherlands Coast Guard, the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> more survivors was [...] "virtually zero" [...] and the search for the missing crew members, who might have been trapped inside the wreck, was called off on the day following the accident.|$|E
50|$|The {{fruit is}} a dehiscent, non-fleshy, 1-locular capsule with many very minute endospermic seeds. Fruits of Orobanchaceae {{are small and}} {{abundant}} and can produce between 10,000-1,000,000 seeds per plant. These are dispersed by the wind over long distances, which increases their <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> a new host.|$|R

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{diagnostic}} tests for Cryptosporidium. [...] They include microscopy, staining, and detection of antibodies. Microscopy can help identify oocysts in fecal matter. [...] To increase the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> the oocysts, the diagnostician should inspect at least 3 stool samples. [...] There are several techniques to concentrate either the stool sample or the oocysts. [...] The modified formalin-ethyl acetate (FEA) concentration method concentrates the stool. [...] Both the modified zinc sulfate centrifugal flotation technique and the Sheather’s sugar flotation procedure can concentrate the oocysts by {{causing them to}} float. [...] Another form of microscopy is fluorescent microscopy done by staining with auramine.|$|E
2500|$|Another way to {{understand}} {{the solution is to}} consider the two original unchosen doors together (Adams 1990; Devlin 2003, 2005; Williams 2004; Stibel et al., 2008). As Cecil Adams puts it (Adams 1990), [...] "Monty is saying in effect: you can keep your one door or you can have the other two doors." [...] The [...] <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> the car has not been changed by the opening of one of these doors because Monty, knowing the location of the car, is certain to reveal a goat. So the player's choice after the host opens a door is no different than if the host offered the player the option to switch from the original chosen door to the set of both remaining doors. The switch in this case clearly gives the player a [...] probability of choosing the car.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2004 season, Lancashire {{released}} him, coach Mike Watkinson's understated {{remark that}} Schofield had [...] "perhaps not reached his full potential" [...] ringing in his ears. However, the player felt that he had been informed of the decision to dispense with his services too late in the year, and that this had affected his <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> a new employer for the following season. He brought a case for unfair dismissal against Lancashire to an employment tribunal, and in April 2005 the panel found in his favour. Meanwhile, Schofield returned to play in club cricket, for Cheshire and Suffolk in the Minor Counties Championship, as well as having several games for the Durham, Sussex and Derbyshire second teams. In 2006 he played for Ormskirk Cricket Club in the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition's Premier League.|$|E
40|$|As {{revealed}} in the previous studies, the earning decomposition based on secondary data has appeared less informative {{with respect to the}} actual and perceived barriers to the integration of labour markets. Hence, additional information is needed to determine what are the biggest constraints <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> ‘good’ jobs? What are the perceived <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> ‘good’ jobs and how stable are they? What other individual characteristics besides formal human capital increase the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> ‘good’ jobs? Do certain labour market segments carry a ‘stigma’ such that it becomes more difficult to move to other segments? As such, the fieldwork has been designed to gather this additional information among a number of the poor wage workers. It is expected that this information is both corroborate the earlier market segmentation analysis based on secondary data as well as provides additional insights into the functioning of labour markets in Vietnam, especially those for the poor.

30|$|In contrast, {{the issue}} of adult {{unemployment}} requires a different solution {{due to the fact}} that their <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> a job are related specifically to their age.
