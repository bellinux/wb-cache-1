Vogt introduced Koehler illumination, and the reddish Nernst glower was replaced with the brighter and whiter incandescent lamp. Special mention should be paid to the experiments that followed Henker’s improvements in 1919. On his improvements the Nitra lamp was replaced with a carbon arc lamp with a liquid filter. At this time the great importance of color temperature and the luminance of the light source for slit lamp examinations were recognized and the basis created for examinations in red-free light.|$|E

The workpieces machined on a jeweler's lathe are metal. Jeweler's lathes can be used with hand-held [...] "graver" [...] tools or with compound rests that attach to the lathe bed. Graver tools are generally supported by a T-rest, not fixed to a <b>cross</b> <b>slide</b> or compound rest. The work is usually held in a collet. Common spindle bore sizes are 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm. The term W/W refers to the Webster/Whitcomb collet and lathe, invented by the American Watch Tool Company of Waltham, Massachusetts. Most lathes commonly referred to as watchmakers lathes are of this design. In 1909, the American Watch Tool company introduced the Magnus type collet (a 10-mm body size collet) using a lathe of the same basic design, the Webster/Whitcomb Magnus. (F.W.Derbyshire, Inc. retains the trade names Webster/Whitcomb and Magnus and still produces these collets.) Two bed patterns are common: the WW (Webster Whitcomb) bed, a truncated triangular prism (found only on 8 and 10 mm watchmakers' lathes); and the continental D-style bar bed (used on both 6 mm and 8 mm lathes by firms such as Lorch and Star). Other bed designs have been used, such a triangular prism on some Boley 6.5 mm lathes, and a V-edged bed on IME's 8 mm lathes.|$|E

40|$|The most {{effective}} method for finish machining of hard-metals and alloys {{is to use}} the diamond grinding wheels for grinding. An application of diamond wheels significantly increases the employee output, reduces costs, and raises manufacturing efficiency with achieving the high performance properties of treated surfaces. During grinding a working surface of diamond wheel wears out. It adversely affects the cutting capability of the diamond grains, and depending on the grinding conditions can occur through different mechanisms. Wear of diamond wheel causes distortion of its shape and reduces cutting properties. However, dressing of diamond wheels is a complicated and time-consuming operation in terms of manufacturing technique. Methods to make dressing of diamond grinding wheel have different types of classification. Classification of dressing methods by the type of energy used is as follows: mechanical, chemical, electrophysical, electromechanical, and electrochemical. All these methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Electrochemical method of dressing is the most productive and efficient. Electrochemical method comprises anode-mechanical dressing and electrochemical (electrolytic) one. The paper presents the electrochemical in-process dressing (ECD) and the electrolytic in-process dressing (ELID). The source of energy, grinding a wheel with metal bond, and an electrode are necessary for providing ELID. The ELID consists of several stages. The first stage is preliminary electrolytic dressing of diamond wheel. The electrolyte is placed into the gap between the wheel and electrode. The bond of the wheel is oxidized. An insulating layer is formed. It reduces an electrical conductivity of the wheel and controls consumption of diamond grains, as well as polishes the surface of the work piece. Further, the insulating layer is destroyed. The cycle of dressing begins anew. The ECD proceeds {{in the same way as}} ELID. However during the ECD-process there is no insulating layer formed. The oxides are washed out by electrolyte flow. The method provides a constant escape of abrasive grain. The grain escape reaches 100 - 120 % of average diameter. Adaptation of ECD on conventional grinding machine is performed. For this, the copper electrode is mounted to the grinding wheel. The electrolyte circulates in the gap between the wheel and electrode. The control system for the normal and tangential forces of process is also used during the adaptation. The enterprise VNIIINSTRUMENT has designed a special experimental stand for diamond grinding. At this stand the ECD-dressing of diamond wheel with metal bond is implemented. This machine consists of a longitudinal support and a <b>cross</b> <b>slide.</b> Spindle of grinding wheel is set on the longitudinal support. A rotating speed of this spindle is about 50 - 3000 rev/min. A spindle of work piece is set on the <b>cross</b> <b>slide.</b> A rotating speed of this spindle is about 10 - 1000 rev/min. The copper electrode is mounted on the spindle of grinding wheel. An area of electrode surface is 1 / 3 of the wheel area. The gap between the grinding wheel and electrode is about 0. 3 mm. The electrolyte is placed in the gap. The electrode is anode and the grinding wheel is cathode. Wheel and electrode are connected to the direct current source. When switching on the power source, the process of electrolysis begins. A bond of the wheel is oxidized and washed out. Waste of dressing is carried away with electrolyte. The electrolyte leaves the zone of cutting. Next, the liquid gets into a special trough. Thereafter, the electrolyte enters the filter unit to have three steps of purification. The purified liquid is supplied to the pump, and then again enters the cutting zone. ECD provides a large escape abrasive grain out of bond. It ensures that the cutting force is constant. The constant cutting force ensures the surface finish consistency, decreased surface roughness, and improved accuracy of work piece form. Due to ECD, space for chips is formed between diamond grains. This allows the grinding wheel to avoid loading. The stand solves the problem of electrolyte purification. This helps to avoid burn marks and defects during grinding. A maximum efficiency of process may be achieved by adjusting the modes of wheel dressing. The ECD allows the use of nontraditional methods of grinding, including ductile mode grinding. However, for this it is necessary to apply the special kinematic scheme of grinding. </p...|$|E
40|$|The main {{research}} {{topic of}} this dissertation thesis {{deals with the}} influence of the working accuracy related to large CNC machines on the required workpiece properties. The state-of-the art has constantly been developed and the customer’s requirements directed to manufacturers of the machine tools are increasingly demanding. There is required a high accuracy, reliability, shortening delivery times etc. The manufacturer is expected to fulfill all the customer’s requirements. The machining accuracy is dependent, among others, on the positioning accuracy of a machine tool that represents the position of the cutting tool relative to a workpiece. The accuracy of a particular machine tool is therefore a limiting factor concerned with reaching the highest accuracy and quality of a workpiece. Acceptance test procedures are initially realized within a manufacturing shop floor and then within a customer environment. The main subject of the testing procedures is to verify. basic properties of a machine tool such as basic dimensions of a machine, strokes in all respective coordinates, machine travels and spindle speeds. A machining of a workpiece with a desired precision specified by the customer is also performed. In this thesis, a new methodology to calculate and determine errors concerned with machining on vertical lathes is proposed with the aim of predicting the machining accuracy of CNC machine tools. The objective of this work was to determine the influence of machining accuracy of a CNC machine in connection with a subsequent geometrical accuracy of a workpiece. Considered position of a tool relative to a workpiece will be affected by errors concerned with a kinematical inaccuracy, geometrical errors and errors related to machining forces. A vertical lathe SKIQ 30 produced by TOSHULIN, a. s. {{has been used as a}} testing machine on which the proposed methodology has been verified. During processing various calculations in this thesis there has been found out that the machining inaccuracy of the machine – main topic of interest – is influenced by the machining conditions such as cutting conditions, material to be machined and even the setting of working positions of the machine. For instance, a position of the <b>cross</b> <b>slide</b> is determined by a workpiece height and a position of the lathe carriage that is determined by a workpiece diameter and a travel of the slide that is also determined by a workpiece height. It can be stated then that to predict the machining accuracy of work pieces, it is important to know the behavior of the machine in its all range of working envelope. Based on the information acquired about the behavior of the machine, it can be determined an appropriate position for a workpiece setting that allows utilizing the maximum reachable accuracy with respect to the stiffness and geometrical accuracy of the machine tool. An appropriate setting of initial working position may influence the subsequent geometrical accuracy of a workpiece...|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The device for laser processing of workpieces, where the focal spot of a laser beam (1) is three-dimensionally movable, comprises two reflecting elements (2, 3) by which the laser beam is directed on a workpiece surface to be processed after dual reflection. The reflecting elements are mounted on two carrier elements (2. 1, 3. 1) and are rotatable to the optical axis of the laser beam hitting on the first reflecting element. The carrier elements are connected by a guide rod (4) and the interval of the reflecting elements is changeable in longitudinal direction of the guide rod. A drive is provided for a common rotation of the reflecting elements with the respective carrier elements and for the interval change of the reflecting elements on the device. The drive for the common rotation and/or translatoric movement grips on carrier element of the second reflecting elements. The guide rod is fixed {{on one of the}} carrier elements in its longitudinal direction and is arranged on another carrier element in a longitudinal guidance (5). The carrier element of the second reflecting element is movable in longitudinal axis of the laser beam directed on the workpiece surface and reflecting elements and the guide rod and/or the longitudinal guidance are pivotably arranged vertically to longitudinal axis of the laser beam directed on the workpiece surface. On the reflecting elements, a rotation drive is arranged by which an angle is pivotable that corresponds to 0. 5 times of the angle by which the guidance rod is directed to 90 degrees to longitudinal axis of the laser beam directed on the workpiece surface. The drive is formed as gear-, frame- or friction gear, where an edge is connected with the respective carrier element and the other edge is connected with the rotation shaft of the respective reflecting elements. The drive is formed as double <b>cross</b> <b>slide</b> for a two-dimensional movement of {{the focal point of the}} laser beam, and for a three-dimensional deflection in the form of a tripod mechanic.
