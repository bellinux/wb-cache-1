5|$|Much of {{the extant}} {{information}} about {{the last few days}} of Poe's life comes from his attending physician, Dr. John Joseph Moran, though his <b>credibility</b> <b>is</b> questionable. Poe was buried after a small funeral at the back of Westminster Hall and Burying Ground, but his remains were moved to a new grave with a larger monument in 1875. The newer monument also marks the burial place of Poe's wife, Virginia, and his mother-in-law, Maria. Theories as to what caused Poe's death include suicide, murder, cholera, hypoglycemia, rabies, syphilis, influenza, and that Poe was a victim of cooping. Evidence of the influence of alcohol is strongly disputed.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} {{source of}} Ajtony's {{life is the}} Long Life of Saint Gerard, compiled {{from a number of}} earlier sources in the early 14th century. According to modern historians (including Carlile Aylmer Macartney and Florin Curta), all information on Ajtony incorporated into the Long Life was based on a ballad about the heroic deeds of Csanád—Ajtony's former commander-in-chief—because a shorter version of Bishop Gerard of Csanád's life does not mention Ajtony. Most historians agree that the ballad was composed shortly after Ajtony's death. In addition to the Long Life, Ajtony is mentioned in the Gesta Hungarorum; the Hungarian chronicle was written after around 1150. According to the Gesta, Ajtony was descended from Glad (in the same source, lord of the Banat); however, its <b>credibility</b> <b>is</b> questioned. In a 1499 sermon the Franciscan Osvát Laskai wrote that Ajtony was from the Nyírség region, but no evidence exists to indicate that Laskai knew his place of birth.|$|E

25|$|Another more {{plausible}} theory from foreign experts, also favored by Pakistan, {{is that the}} explosive shock waves {{from one of the}} depth charges set off the torpedoes and mines (some of which may have been armed for laying) stored aboard the submarine. The Navy NHQ counter-argued: Ghazi itself may have inadvertently passed over the mines during the mine laying operations; patrolling Indian vessels or Indian depth charges might also have tripped the count mechanism of one or more mines. <b>Credibility</b> <b>is</b> added to this story by the later discovery made by Indian Coast Guard divers in 2003, that the damaged parts of the submarine had been blown inside out.|$|E
25|$|Since {{newspapers}} {{began as}} a journal (record of current events), the profession involved {{in the making of}} newspapers began to be called journalism. In the yellow journalism era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the public, rather than to inform. The restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around World War II. Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement. <b>Credibility</b> <b>is</b> questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and grammar; real or perceived bias; and scandals involving plagiarism and fabrication.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} {{questions}} concerning the historicity {{of the work is}} whether the identities mentioned are as ancient as stated or date from a later time. The evidence allows a wide range of views, the most skeptical being that the work is mainly mythological, or if Jordanes did exist and is the author, that he describes peoples of the 6th century only. According to the latter, his main source's <b>credibility</b> <b>is</b> questionable for a number of reasons. First, the originality of his main source, Cassiodorus, is debatable because large part of it consists of culling of ancient Greek and Latin authors for descriptions of peoples who might have been Goths. Not only that but it seems that Jordanes has distorted Cassiodorus's narrative by presenting us a cursory abridgement of the latter, mixed with 6th century ethnic names.|$|E

25|$|There is an unsolved {{issue about}} his final rank.

A national telephone survey of 536 adults was conducted in February 2002.

While there were similarities in how each medium was perceived, the study also revealed some fundamental differences. Respondents evaluated newspaper and television news credibility more similarly than they did online news credibility. Respondents judged all three news media most positively in terms of current, up-to-date, and timely and most negatively in terms of bias and completeness. However, online users were less negative than newspaper readers and television viewers. Factor analyses yielded somewhat different dimensions.

2500|$|However, {{there is}} {{considerable}} evidence to dispute this claim. Baseball historian George B. Kirsch has described {{the results of the}} Mills Commission as a [...] "myth". He wrote, [...] "Robert Henderson, Harold Seymour, and other scholars have since debunked the Doubleday-Cooperstown myth, which nonetheless remains powerful in the American imagination because of the efforts of Major League Baseball and the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown." [...] At his death, Doubleday left many letters and papers, none of which describe baseball or give any suggestion that he considered himself a prominent person {{in the evolution of the}} game, and his New York Times obituary did not mention the game at all. Chairman Mills himself, who had been a Civil War colleague of Doubleday and a member of the honor guard for Doubleday's body as it lay in state in New York City, never recalled hearing Doubleday describe his role as the inventor. Doubleday was a cadet at West Point in the year of the alleged invention and his family had moved away from Cooperstown the prior year. Furthermore, the primary testimony to the commission that connected baseball to Doubleday was that of Abner Graves, whose <b>credibility</b> <b>is</b> questionable; a few years later, he shot his wife to death and was committed to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life. Part of the confusion could stem from there being another man by the same name in Cooperstown in 1839.|$|E
2500|$|Many critics judge Captain John Smith's {{character}} and credibility {{as an author}} based on a single event, his description of Pocahontas saving his life from the hand of Powhatan. Additional and probably more accurate judgments should rest upon his relationship with both the Native Americans and colonists of Jamestown. Smith earned his status as an American hero through his strong work ethic and compromise with the Native Americans, themes that reappear in his writings such as The Generall Historie of Virginia and The True Travels…of Captain John Smith. Most of the critical scepticism of Smith's <b>credibility</b> <b>is</b> {{a result of the}} differences between his narratives. His earliest text is A True Relation of Virginia, which was submitted for publication in 1608, the year after his experiences in Jamestown. The second, The Generall Historie, was published sixteen years later in 1624. Compared to The Generall Historie, many events are either left out or changed, including the Pocahontas scene. Accordingly, the publishing of letters, journals, and pamphlets from the colonists was regulated by the companies that sponsored the voyage, in that they must go [...] "directly to the company" [...] because no one was to [...] "write any letter of anything that may discourage others". Smith is now known to have violated this regulation by first publishing A True Relation as an unknown author.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Patients' initial {{beliefs about}} {{the success of a}} given pain {{treatment}} are shown to affect final treatment outcome. The Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) has recently been developed as measure of treatment credibility and expectancy. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were (1) to investigate the factor structure of the CEQ in a sample of chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients by means of a confirmatory factor analysis, (2) to examine the association between treatment credibility and expectancy and patient characteristics, and (3) to assess whether treatment expectancy and <b>credibility</b> <b>are</b> associated with the outcome of rehabilitation treatment. METHODS: CLBP patients (n= 167) were randomized to either active physical therapy (n= 51), cognitive-behavioral therapy (n= 57), or a combination therapy (n= 59), and completed the CEQ after a careful explanation of the treatment rationale. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis supported the 2 -factor structure (credibility/expectancy) of the CEQ. Lower <b>credibility</b> <b>was</b> associated with higher pain-related fear and lower internal control of pain, and lower expectancy with higher levels of pain-related fear and no radiating pain. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that after controlling for age, sex, treatment center, pain-intensity at baseline, duration of disability, and irrespective of the treatment offered, expectancy was significantly associated with disability and satisfaction. <b>Credibility</b> <b>was</b> significantly associated with patient-specific symptoms and satisfaction. For global perceived effect, treatment expectancy was predictive in active physical therapy only, and treatment <b>credibility</b> <b>was</b> a significant predictor in combination therapy only. DISCUSSION: Although the associations found were low to modest, these results underscore the importance of expectancy and credibility for the outcome of different active interventions for CLBP and might {{contribute to the development of}} more effective treatments. status: publishe...|$|R
