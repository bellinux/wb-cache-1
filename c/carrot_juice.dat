5|$|Carrot soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or chicken stock {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. <b>Carrot</b> <b>juice</b> and orange juice can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed carrot. After cooking, the dish can be run through a sieve to strain it. The carrots used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled carrots can lend to increased smoothness in puréed versions of the dish. Those prepared with puréed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{survey of}} benzene {{contamination}} in 451 beverage samples using headspace sampling {{in combination with}} gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (HS-GC/MS) with a quantification limit of 0. 13 µg l- 1 was conducted. Artefactual benzene formation during headspace sampling was excluded by only mildly heating at 50 °C and adjustment of sample pH to 10. The incidence for benzene contamination in soft drinks, beverages for babies, alcopops and beer-mixed drinks was relatively low with average concentrations below the EU drinking water limit of 1 µg l- 1. Significantly higher concentrations were only found in <b>carrot</b> <b>juices,</b> with the highest levels in <b>carrot</b> <b>juices</b> specifically intended for infants. About 94 % of 33 <b>carrot</b> <b>juices</b> for infants had detectable benzene levels with an average concentration of 1. 86 ± 1. 05 µg l- 1. The benzene contamination in beverages was significantly correlated to iron and copper concentrations, which act as catalyst in benzene formation. The formation of benzene in <b>carrot</b> <b>juices</b> was predominantly caused by a heat-induced mechanism, which explains the higher occurrence in infant <b>carrot</b> <b>juices</b> that are considerably heated to exclude microbiological contamination...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Carrots and {{red beet}} were {{evaluated}} {{as a potential}} substrate {{for the production of}} lactic acid fermented juices by Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium sp. Both strains were found capable to grow on the vegetable juices, but some differences between the dynamics of the processes, dependent not only by the culture but by the sort of the raw material, had as consequence the production of the final products with different stability degrees. The pH value of the <b>carrot</b> <b>juices</b> was decreased from an initial value by 6. 45 to below 4. 3 after 48 hours of lactic acid fermentation with Bifidobacterium sp., respectively to 3. 84 after 24 hours when Lactobacillus acidophilus was inoculated. The last strain has produced a significant increase of the titrable acidity, the fermented <b>carrot</b> <b>juices</b> containing 0. 7 % acids (expressed as lactic acid). In the case of the fermentation of the red beet juices it is also recommended the strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus, because the pH value decrease with 2 units in 24 hours.

The aim of this thesis was the development of three products derived from fermented fruit and vegetables juices, by lactic acid bacteria. Forteen strains of lactic acid bacteria in mono and/or co-culture were tested in the fermentation of the juices, in various combinations. For the beverage, the best results were obtained from the mixture of beet, apple and <b>carrot</b> <b>juices,</b> fermented by a strain of Lactobacillus plantarum. Fermentation of beet and <b>carrot</b> <b>juices</b> by L. plantarum and Leuconostoc mesenteroides was the one that led to the best results another, the best result was obtained for salad dressing. The fermentation of beet juice with Lactobacillus pentosus was another god result for salad dressing. After 24 hours of fermentation, the three products reached a pH value lower than or equal to 4, which contributed to their microbiological stability. A reduction of total sugars of about 21 % in the beverage and between 17 and 25 % in the sauces was recorded. For the three products, the final value of lactic acid bacteria was approximately 9 log CFU/mL. For the fermented beverage, after 12 days of refrigeration at 7 °C, this value was 7 log CFU/mL.

40|$|Phenolic {{extracts}} {{of apple}} and <b>carrot</b> <b>juices</b> and apple and carrot tissue, and selected pure compounds were examined {{for their ability}} to decrease the viability of human colon cancer cells (HT 29 and LoVo) in vitro. In addition, apple and <b>carrot</b> <b>juices</b> were supplemented with phloretin and chlo-rogenic acid, respectively, to simulate genetically modified products with enhanced levels of these phytochemicals and screened as described above. Amongst the pure compounds tested, phloretin was shown to have the greatest effect on the viability of both cell lines. Here we report that phloretin has a marked effect on the survival of colon cancer cells at concentrations as low as 50 µmol/L, and therefore shows significant anticarcinogenic potential. With regard to the effect of the phenolic extracts of apple and carrot tissue, that from transgenic carrot decreased cell viability by as much as 20 % at the highest concentration (200 µg/mL). Phenolic extracts of control carrot and control apple tissue had little effect. However similar extracts of apple juice supplemented with either 500 or 1000 µmol/L phloretin reduced the survival of LoVo cells to 10 % and showed marked activity at 100 µmol/L. Apple juice alone did not reduce cell viability, probably because the concentration of phloretin was too low. This information sup-ports the recommendation that consumers should be encouraged to eat more fruit and vegetables, especially those containing compounds such as phloretin. There is also potential for food producers and manufacturers to develop products with enhanced flavonoid content, either by conventional breeding, transgenically or by supplementation...|$|R

Fresh carrots and carrots stored five months were pressed to raw juice and heat-treated at 70 degrees C for 20 minutes in the aim of destroy the undesirable microorganisms. <b>Carrot</b> <b>juices</b> were inoculated with lactic acid bacteria isolated from epiphytic microbiota at the concentration of 4 x 105 UFC/ml and fermented in a thermostat for 96 hours. During the fermentation the following analytical parameters were established: reducing sugars, total acidity, pH, amino acids content, nitrites content, ascorbic acid content. During fermentation the pH of <b>carrot</b> <b>juices</b> decreases from 6, 15 to 3, 99, while the total acidity increases from 0, 06 to 1, 62 % (as lactic acid). Less than 25 % of the initial content of ascorbic acid rests in the juices after 96 hours of fermentation. The amino acids content of juices, expressed as g N 2 / 100 g, increase with a middle of 50 % in 96 hours, due of the proteins decomposition. The pre-digestion of these compounds improve the nutritional quality of the lactofermented juices. We found that the glucose supplement hasn’t a significant influence about the lactic acid accumulation. Also, {{at the end of the}} period of study, we found that the substratum metabolization was difficult in the sample with 1 % glucose initial added. The quality of the raw materials, especially concerning the sugars content and the total acidity at the beginning of the fermentation process is important because a rapidly increase of acidity minimizes the influence of spoilage bacteria. To proceed from the results of the sensory analysis and the results of the chemical analysis we recommend stopping the fermentation of these juices after 72 hours...|$|R

Analyses of the genotoxicity data revealed a more steady state of protection for GSTMJ*+ than for GSTMJ*O (15 and 8 of 23, respectively) genotypes. Increased expression of cytosolic protein was observed in 11 of 23 subjects, increased expression of GSTP 1 in 6 of 23 subjects, and capacity of repair of oxidized DNA bases in 9 of 21 subjects. GSTP 1 induction was independent of the GSTPJ genotype (GSTPJa or GSTPIb/c alleles). Kinetics of induction of cytosolic protein and of GSTP 1 were compared in one GSTMJ*+ and one GSTMJ*O subject and showed an efficacy of tomato and carrots, but not of spinach. Reduced genetic DNA damage in lymphocytes {{may be due to the}} enhancement of cytosolic GSTP 1, and DNA-repair proteins by tomato and <b>carrot</b> <b>juices.</b> Enhancement of cytosolic proteins may be indicative of increased gene expression by vegetable juices, some of which may be associated with protective activities...|$|R

Based on these, the homofermenter Lactobacillus pentosus and the heterofermenter Leuconostoc mesenteroides were tested as potential starters, in single and mixed cultures, for the fermentation of carrots (Daucus carota), as a novel fermentable substrate, and cabbage (Brassica oleracea) into sauerkraut. Fermentations were performed {{in the presence of the}} natural microflora. Sugar catabolism and acid production were monitored through H. P. L. C [...] In the fermentation of carrots Leuconostoc mesenteroides played a major role, with no homofermenters present. For sauerkraut, the mixed starter culture composed of Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Lactobacillus pentosus gave the closest resemblance to the product normally obtained following a natural commercial fermentation. The inclusion of the heterofermenter provided the required acid balance for correct product flavour and aroma by enhancing production of acetic acid. Acetate is also a better antimicrobial than lactate. A shorter fermentation time was also obtained, reducing the time from 3 - 4 weeks in the natural fermentation to only 7 days with the use of the mixed starter. When reduced salt concentrations were tried, 1 % NaCl (w/w) resembled the spontaneous fermentation more closely, in regard to microbial sequence, pH and total acidity. Different ratios of the two lactic acid bacteria in combination were tried, the best being that in which L, mesenteroides and L. pentosus were initially present in the same proportions.
