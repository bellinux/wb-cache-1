5|$|At {{the back}} of the race, Bourdais began a slow <b>climb</b> <b>back</b> up the field. The Toro Rosso driver passed Sutil (who later spun out and retired with a gearbox problem), Nakajima and Coulthard, to sit in 15th by lap30. Rosberg fought Glock for 12th, until he passed the Toyota at the turn14 hairpin on lap12. Rosberg's pit stop relegated him to 18th, {{dropping}} six places. Kubica pitted late, on lap25, dropping from third to ninth, one position outside of the points.|$|E
5|$|Coulthard and Button {{collided}} on lap18 when Button {{attempted to}} pass the Red Bull on the inside at turn eight; the Honda lost its front wing and retired a lap later after two pit stops. Hamilton continued his <b>climb</b> <b>back</b> through the field; he moved from 18th, passing Piquet, Davidson, Sutil and Bourdais in separate manoeuvres, to sit in 14th {{by the time he}} pitted on lap31. Piquet retired on lap42 with transmission failure, requiring a gearbox change before the next race.|$|E
5|$|Pryce made a poor {{start to}} the Grand Prix in his DN8 {{and by the end}} of the first lap was in last place. Pryce started to <b>climb</b> <b>back</b> up the field during the next couple of laps, {{overtaking}} Brett Lunger and team mate Renzo Zorzi on lap two, and Alex Ribeiro and Boy Hayje the following lap. By lap 18 Pryce had moved from 22nd to 13th place.|$|E

5|$|Koalas {{may live}} from 13 to 18 {{years in the}} wild. While female koalas usually live this long, males may die sooner because of their more {{hazardous}} lives. Koalas usually survive falls from trees and immediately <b>climb</b> <b>back</b> up, but injuries and deaths from falls do occur, particularly in inexperienced young and fighting males. Around six years of age, the koala's chewing teeth begin to wear down and their chewing efficiency decreases. Eventually, the cusps disappear completely and the animal will die of starvation.|$|E
5|$|After {{one season}} in the Third Division South and {{eighteen}} in total, Edmund Goodman stepped down as manager and returned to administrative duties, and a succession of managers attempted to plot Palace's <b>climb</b> <b>back</b> up the table. However, Palace's stay in the division was to {{last as long as}} the Third Division South itself. With only the champions gaining promotion, it was a difficult division to be promoted from, although Palace came close on more than one occasion. In the fourteen Division Three South seasons pre-Second World War, Palace finished in the top seven ten times, and never lower than fourteenth. Palace finished runners-up no less than three times, and when the 1939–40 season ended, Palace were sitting fourth. Unfortunately the season was only four matches old, cancelled with the onset of the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} moth {{was thought to}} be from China or Bengal, but was later found to be endemic to Madagascar. It is found {{throughout}} the year {{in most parts of the}} island, with peak populations between March and August, and smallest numbers between October and December. Females lay about 80 eggs under the leaves of Omphalea spp. The caterpillars are whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and are covered in club-ended black setae. Silk spun from the mouth helps the caterpillars hold on to smooth leaves and <b>climb</b> <b>back</b> to the plant when they fall. After completing four instars, the caterpillars spin an open network cocoon. The pupal stage lasts from 17 to 23 days.|$|E

5|$|On July 10—when {{the storm}} was {{approaching}} or at its peak intensity with winds of —the Bowditch encountered severe hurricane conditions which destroyed both of her masts and washed her entire crew overboard. Her captain was able to <b>climb</b> <b>back</b> aboard, where he survived for over a week with no food or water until he was rescued by a schooner. The Echo and Creole both sustained significant damage, and the crew and captain of the latter ship had to be rescued after she began taking on water. The extent of {{the damage to the}} three ships served as the basis for evaluating the storm's intensity in Partagás's paper. The hurricane ultimately passed between Bermuda and the United States before dissipating after July 12.|$|E
5|$|After they hatch, {{the small}} {{caterpillars}} only eat the tissue (parenchyma) between the veins of the leaves. They {{do this to}} avoid the sticky and toxic latex produced by the plant's laticifers and transported in the veins. After 3–4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, tendrils, petioles and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands {{at the base of}} the leaf, near the petiole. They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of mouthpart coagulation. The caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an '∞' motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface of the leaves. The silk also permits them to <b>climb</b> <b>back</b> to the plant should they fall. Strong rain makes them fall despite the silk. There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm season to two and a half to three months in the cold season. The caterpillar is whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club-ended black setae. It has five pairs of prolegs on segments 3 to 6 and 10, and six true legs attached to the thorax.|$|E
5|$|On 29November, {{the crew}} {{assembled}} {{to consider the}} proposal {{that some of the}} slaves should be thrown overboard. James Kelsall later claimed that he had disagreed with the plan at first but it was soon unanimously agreed. On 29November, 54women and children were thrown through cabin windows into the sea. On 1December, 42male slaves were thrown overboard, and 36more followed in the next few days. Another ten, in a display of defiance at the inhumanity of the slavers, jumped into the sea. Having heard the shrieks of the victims as they were thrown into the water, one slave requested that the remaining Africans be denied all food and drink rather than be thrown into the sea. The crew ignored this request. In total, 132 Africans were killed by the time the ship reached the Caribbean. The account of the King's Bench trial reports that one slave managed to <b>climb</b> <b>back</b> onto the ship.|$|E

25|$|The 1984–85 Cup Winners' Cup {{campaign}} {{was not without}} its controversy. In a tie with Fortuna Sittard of the Netherlands, an Everton fan streaked on the pitch and was arrested when trying to <b>climb</b> <b>back</b> over the security fencing into the stands. This {{was one of many}} high-profile pitch invasions by fans of English clubs at home and abroad around this time.|$|E

25|$|For {{commercial}} divers {{or technical}} divers who may spend many {{hours in a}} dry suit underwater, it is not practical to have to <b>climb</b> <b>back</b> on board the ship in order to open a waterproof relief zipper and urinate. The P-valve is a urinal built into the suit, which enables a diver to urinate at any time without having {{to get out of}} the water, while keeping him or her dry and clean inside the suit.|$|E
25|$|At times, C-123 {{crews were}} {{uncomfortable with the}} assault role. South Vietnamese Special Forces were {{sometimes}} capricious about when and where they would fight. Straight cargo operations were hazardous enough, especially during the monsoon season when South Vietnamese troops were socked in within the mountainous valleys. To execute the mission, the C-123s would line up in a proper direction, let down in the undercast, {{and if they did}} not break out by a given altitude, would <b>climb</b> <b>back</b> up. There were usually 800-foot ceilings in the valleys, {{and most of the time}} they broke out.|$|E
25|$|The West Indies started {{well with}} Badree bowling Roy for a duck {{with just the}} second ball and fellow opener Alex Hales being caught off Andre Russell in the second over. Morgan was caught at slip by Gayle off Badree to leave England at 3/23 after 4.4 overs. Root helped England <b>climb</b> <b>back</b> into the game with 54 off 36, but he was caught playing an uncharacteristic paddle sweep off Carlos Brathwaite. Dwayne Bravo then took two wickets in three balls {{dropping}} England from 110/4 to 111/7. Batting deep, England managed to finish at 155/9 after their 20 overs.|$|E

25|$|Wednesday were relegated {{at the end}} of the 1969–70 season; this {{began the}} darkest period in the club's history, {{eventually}} culminating in the club dropping to the Third Division for the first time in its history, and in 1976 it almost fell into the Fourth Division. It was not until the appointment of Jack Charlton as manager in 1977 that the club started to <b>climb</b> <b>back</b> up the league pyramid. Charlton led the Owls back to the Second Division in 1980 before handing the reins to Howard Wilkinson, who took the club back into the top flight in 1984, after an absence of 14 years.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} a number of {{techniques}} for unassisted righting and re-entry of a kayak after a capsize and turtling, most paddlers consider it safest to paddle with one or more others, as assistance is useful if attempting to recover via rolling solo fails. Even if the assistance fails to successfully right the kayaker, it is much easier to <b>climb</b> <b>back</b> into a boat in the open sea if one has another boat and paddler to help and the swamped boat has been emptied of water first. Nonetheless, experienced paddlers do attempt open-water crossings unaccompanied, and many major long-distance kayak expeditions have been carried out solo.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{spent the}} first 95 minutes of the flight {{calibrating}} their equipment. Upon receiving updated weather information for both available routes, they chose the northern one. They were supposed to begin their low-level simulated penetration of enemy airspace just south of Princeton, Maine, near West Grand Lake. From there, they would head north to Millinocket and fly over the mountains in the Jo-Mary/Greenville area. They planned to turn northeast near Seboomook Lake and southeast near Caucomgomoc Lake to proceed through the mountains of northern Baxter State Park. After crossing Traveler Mountain, the aircraft was supposed to <b>climb</b> <b>back</b> to altitude over the Houlton VOR Station.|$|E
