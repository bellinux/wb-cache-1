The Stratford Avon watershed in Perth County and the Big Creek watershed in Middlesex County, both located in southwestern Ontario, are used as case studies.

Alternative conservation tillage practices include fall <b>chisel</b> <b>ploughing,</b> ridge planting, no tillage and buffer strips. At each level of the targeting criteria, the reduction in offyarm damage is estimated using the Guelph Model for Evaluating the Effects of Agricultural Management Systems on Erosion and Sedimentation (GAMES). Economic targeting criteria are based on the value of improved water quality under a conservation practice minus the onlfarm costs of adoption of that practice. Targeting conservation policies on the basis of reduction of offlfarm damages can result in greater eficiency in public policy.

A recolha da folhada efectuou-se durante três anos, de Abril de 1996 a Março de 1999. A maior produção média anual de folhada foi obtida no T 3 (mobilização nula) provavelmente devido ao facto das raízes não terem sido danificadas.

The technique was tested on marginally cultivated, hard compacted soil of relatively low infiltration rates, locally known as "gardud" (sandy clay). This type of soil is of good farming potential if appropriate soil and water management techniques are undertaken. The aim of using this technique {{is to improve the}} ability of "gardud" soil to absorb and conserve water, to alleviate the effect of long dry spells by harvesting surface runoff to increase soil water storage for earlier and better plant establishment and hence to increase yield. The chisel and contour bunding every 10 metres were better than the control flat technique in improving soil physical properties and increasing soil water storage. The effect was reflected in highly significant sorghum plant establishment and growth. Both grain and dry matter yields were significantly increased by chisel and contour bunding. The technique increased grain yield by 152 % over the control. Also, contour and non-contour treatments produced 1277 kg/ha and 1016 kg/ha, respectively, for the mean of chisel and flat treatments with 25. 7 % increase. The economic analysis indicated a 204 % marginal rate of return for chisel polugh with contour over chisel alone. Even contour bunding with flat cultivation has doubled the economic return compared to the traditional flat alone. Therefore, this improved technology is economically superior to the traditional cultivation. Furthermore, it can be adopted to utilize- "gardud" soil as an alternative to, and to relief pressure from, exhausted and continuously cultivated poor "goz" sandy soil.

This multidisciplinary experiment, which began in 1996 and finished in 1998, was carried out over an agricultural soil which was left fallow. Within the experimental field, two plots were delimited where two tillage treatments were applied, a mould-board ploughing (or conventional tillage denoted CT) and <b>chisel</b> <b>ploughing</b> (reduced tillage denoted RT). This was to study on bare soil the influence of tillage method on surface conditions, saltation flux, vertical dust flux, erosion rates, dynamics characteristics such as friction velocity, roughness length, etc., and energy budget. The partitioning of the available energy, resulting from the dynamics of the SBL, are quite different over the two plots because of their own peculiar soil and surface properties. The first results show that the RT treatment seems to provide a wind erosion protection. Because of the long data recording time and particular phenomena (formation of a crust at the soil surface, very dry conditions, high wind speed for instance), these microclimatological data acquired during the WELSONS programmes may be helpful to test atmospheric boundary-layer models coupled with soil models.

40|$|Zero tillage and {{controlled}} traffic {{have been proposed}} as means for more productive and sustainable irrigated farming. Both practices affect soil infiltration characteristics and, therefore, should have effects on sprinkler irrigation performance. This study compared water infiltration and runoff in three sprinkler irrigation tests performed on an alluvial loam soil at different times during a maize (Zea mays L.) -cotton (Gossypium hirstium L.) rotation under two soil managements: permanent beds with crop residue retention (PB: planting beds maintained unaltered from year to year) and conventional beds with residues incorporated with tillage (CB: disc and <b>chisel</b> <b>ploughing</b> followed by rotavator pass and bed forming every year). Traffic was controlled and two types of furrows were distinguished in both tillage systems: with (+T) and without (-T) wheel traffic. The irrigation tests were performed on maize at full cover, on bare soil just before cotton sowing and on cotton with 50 % ground cover. Infiltration and runoff were affected notably by both traffic and soil management. The soil under PB infiltrated more water than under CB, and -T furrows more than +T furrows. Considering the combined treatments, -T furrows in the CB system infiltrated more water than +T furrows in the PB system. A sprinkler irrigation model for simulating water application and soil infiltration and runoff was formulated. The model was used to analyse irrigation performance under infiltration characteristic of the CB and PB systems in trafficked and non-trafficked furrows. Five irrigation performance indicators {{were used to assess}} the various combinations of tillage and traffic: Wilkox-Swailes coefficient of uniformity; application efficiency; deep percolation ratio; tail water ratio; and adequacy. The model was used to develop operation diagrams and provided guidelines for making irrigation decisions in the new controlled traffic/permanent bed system and in a standard conventional system. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|Preceding crop greatly {{affects the}} agronomic and {{economic}} performance of durum wheat, but its interaction with tillage intensity was scarcely investigated {{at the early}} transition from conventional to reduced tillage. This work was aimed at studying how preceding crop determines the performance of durum wheat during the early transition from conventional to reduced tillage. To this end, the effect of four preceding crops (sunflower, durum wheat, alfalfa and maize) in interaction with two tillage systems without inversion (RT 1 – <b>chisel</b> <b>ploughing,</b> disking twice, and harrowing and RT 2 – disking twice and harrowing) and a conventional tillage (CT – mouldboard ploughing, disking twice, and harrowing) was studied on durum wheat in two years of cultivation. The effect of preceding crop on grain yield and yield components of durum wheat was different depending on tillage intensity, and this effect varied depending on the year of cultivation. Grain yield increased by 1. 1 – 4. 2 t ha− 1 {{with the increase of}} the intensity of tillage in both years and all preceding crops, with the only exception of wheat crop following sunflower in 2009 – 2010 and following maize in 2010 – 2011. RT 2 decreased wheat grain yield when compared with RT 1 only with alfalfa as preceding crop. Differences in grain yield among tillage systems and crops preceding wheat in both years were mainly due to variations of mean kernel weight and number of spikes per unit area. The profitability of durum wheat varied according to the year of cultivation, the preceding crop and the tillage system. Overall, in both years profitability was lowest and negative following wheat under reduced tillage system, while it was highest and positive following alfalfa under CT. Reduced growth of durum wheat with reduced tillage systems was mainly consequence of weeds and volunteers plants development and nitrogen availability in soil resulting from nutrient immobilization. It can be concluded that potential yield penalties in durum wheat in the transition from conventional to reduced tillage can be alleviated by an appropriate selection of preceding crops...|$|R
