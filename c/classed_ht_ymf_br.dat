Results. The quinapril treatment (average daily dose 17. 3 ± 7. 9 mg) improved myocardium structural and functional parameters, increased the exercise tolerance, reduced neurohumoral activity, improved the RAS according to CRS test: increase in synchronization range of cardiorespiratory cycles per minute from 8. 0 ± 2. 1 to 11. 0 ± 2. 5 (Δ 27. 3 %; p< 0. 01), as well as RAS index from 52. 6 ± 7. 8 to 89. 7 ± 8. 9 (Δ 41. 4 %; p< 0. 01), and decrease in the duration of CRS development at the minimal border of cardiac cycles from 15. 5 ± 3. 5 to 12. 9 ± 2. 8 (Δ 15. 8 %; p< 0. 01).

40|$|Background—The {{survival}} {{benefit of}} heart transplantation (HT) compared with optimal medical therapy (OMT) {{has never been}} tested. Methods and Results—We created a decision analytic model that simulates a randomized clinical trial of OMT versus HT for each New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. The simulation calculates average life expectancy. The following assumptions were made for OMT annual mortality: class I no excess mortality from HF; class II and III based on MERIT-HF are 5. 3 % and 8. 1 %. Class IV is 12. 8 %, based on COPERNICUS. HT mortality rates were based on survival curves for HT 1982 to 2001. For classes I, II, and III, OMT demonstrated a life expectancy gain of 113 months (2322. 2 versus 1192. 1), 38 months (1522. 1 versus 1142. 1), and 6 months (1171. 8 versus 1112. 2), respectively, over <b>HT.</b> <b>Class</b> IV favored <b>HT</b> with a life expectancy gain of 26 months (1072. 1 versus 811. 4) over OMT. Sensitivity analysis revealed if improvement in OMT decreased mortality by 38 % for class IV patients, OMT and HT would have equivalent life expectancies. If improvement in HT resulted in a 7 % increase in post-HT survival, OMT and HT would be equivalent for class III patients. If improvement in HT resulted in a 30 % increase in post-HT survival, OMT and HT would be equivalent for class II patients. Conclusions—Our model predicts that currently, OMT is superior to <b>HT</b> for <b>classes</b> I, II, and III, but HT is superior for class IV.

40|$|The main {{motivation}} {{of this article}} is to derive sufficient conditions for dynamical stability of periodically driven quantum systems described by a Hamiltonian H(t), i. e., conditions under which it holds sup_t in R | (psi(t),H(t) psi(t)) |<∞ where psi(t) denotes a trajectory at time t of the quantum system under consideration. We start from an analysis of the domain of the quasi-energy operator. Next we show, under certain assumptions, that if the spectrum of the monodromy operator U(T, 0) is pure point then there exists a dense subspace of initial conditions for which the mean value of energy is uniformly bounded in the course of time. Further we show that if the propagator admits a differentiable Floquet decomposition then || H(t) psi(t) || is bounded in time for any initial condition psi(0), and one employs the quantum KAM algorithm to prove the existence of this type of decomposition for a fairly large <b>class</b> of <b>H(t).</b> In addition, we derive bounds uniform in time on transition probabilities between different energy levels, and we also propose an extension of this approach to the case of a higher order of differentiability of the Floquet decomposition. The procedure is demonstrated on a solvable example of the periodically time-dependent harmonic oscillator. Comment: 39 page...|$|R
40|$|Aim. To {{assess the}} changes in blood {{pressure}} (BP) circadian profile and variability in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) of ischemic etiology and arterial hypertension (HT) due to the complex therapy including ivabradine. Material and methods. Patients (n= 90) with CHF class II–III NYHA associated with stable angina II-III <b>class</b> and <b>HT</b> were examined. The patients were randomized into 3 groups depending on received drugs: perindopril and ivabradine - group 1; perindopril, bisoprolol and ivabradine - group 2; perindopril and bisoprolol - group 3. The duration of therapy was 6 months. Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was assessed at baseline and after treatment. Results. More significant reduction in average 24 -hours systolic BP was found in groups 1 and 2 compared to group 3 (Δ%: - 19. 4 ± 0, 4; - 21. 1 ± 0. 4 and - 11. 8 ± 0. 6, respectively) as well as diastolic BP (Δ%: - 10. 6 ± 0. 6; - 12. 9 ± 0. 4 and - 4, 3 ± 0. 3, respectively) and other ABPM indicators. Improvement of BP circadian rhythm was found due to {{increase in the number}} of «Dipper» patients (p= 0. 016). More significant reduction in average daily and night systolic and diastolic BP (p= 0. 001), as well as daily and night BP variability (p= 0. 001) was also found in patients of group 2 compared to these of group 1. Conclusion. Moderate antihypertensive effect (in respect of both diastolic and systolic BP) was shown when ivabradine was included into the complex therapy of patients with ischemic CHF and HT. The effect was more pronounced when ivabradine was combined with perindopril and bisoprolol. This was accompanied by reduction in high BP daily variability and improvement of the BP circadian rhythm.  </p...|$|R

Before the First World War, classes V V, I V, XI HV, XI H, XI HV, XII H2 (later class 38.2-3) and XI <b>HT</b> (<b>class</b> 94.19-21) {{were added to}} these. After the First World War, class XIII H (class 58.4) locomotives were used for freight operations. Locomotives of the Royal Saxon State Railways were used almost exclusively {{until the end of}} the 1920s, but afterwards other locomotives were operated occasionally. However, the Saxon State Railways locomotives remained in use at least until 1965. Class 75.5 locomotives were used at Adolf only for a short time; as a substitute for one received at the end of the 1920s, it received several brand new class 86 locomotives. The class 38.2-3 was supplemented by class 38.10-40 locomotives, which could be used in the same way. Numerous locomotives of class 58.10-21 with the same design as class 58.4 were introduced in the Vogtland. Some class 50 locomotives were stationed in Adorf in the Second World War, but before the end of the war they had been replaced by class 52. Classes 38.2-3, 52, 58, 75.5, 86 and 94.19-21 locomotives were available in the locomotive depot at the end of the war. In addition, there were individual locomotives of classes 53, 54.15-17, 91 and 56.34-35, but they were retired soon after the end of the war or handed over to other departments. The tender locomotives were also retired and were replaced by more tender locomotives of classes 75.5 and 86. With the advent of uranium mining, Adorf once again received class 58.4 locomotives, which from then on also hauled express trains—including the Karlex—as well as heavy freight trains. In addition, class 50 locomotives were introduced in the mid-1950s. The first time diesel locomotives, belonging to class V 200, were stationed in Adorf in 1968 and the change of traction to diesel was completed in 1971. After that only diesel vehicles were used until the closure of the locomotive depot. In addition to class V 60 locomotives, class V 180 and 130/131/132 locomotives were also based in Adorf.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the scalar differential equation u ̇ = f(u) + c h(t) where f(u) is a jumping nonlinearity and h(t) {{is an almost}} periodic function, while c is a real parameter deciding {{the size of the}} forcing term. The main result is that, if h(t) does not vanish too much in some suitable sense, then the equation admits a (unique) almost periodic solution for large values of the parameter c. The <b>class</b> of the <b>h(t)</b> ’s to which the result applies is studied in detail: it includes all the nontrivial trigonometric polynomials and is generic in the Baire sense. 1. The problem This paper is concerned with the nonlinear scalar differential equation: (1. 1) u ̇ = f(u) + h(t) where the forcing term h(t) is almost periodic and the nonlinearity is a Lipschitz function which satisfies: (1. 2) f(±∞) = ±∞ Indeed, stronger growth assumptions on the nonlinearity will be really needed, these will be discussed later on. On the contrary, the choice of the growth direction is purely conventional: it will be clear that nothing changes, when (1. 2) is replaced by f(±∞) = ∓∞. The problem investigated is the existence of almost periodic solutions to the equa-tion (1. 1). Though explicit counter–examples are not available in the literature, the problem is not expected to be solvable for every almost periodic h(t) : many negative results are indeed known for similar problems, like for instance in [17], [8], [11] and [19]. This fact is in sharp contrast with the periodic and the bounded analogues, though the almost periodicity is in some sense intermediate between them: {{it is not difficult to}} check that bounded solutions always exist when h(t) is bounded (see also Section 3) and it is well known that this implies the solvability in the periodic framework, when h(t) is periodic too (see [14]). The most classical existence result in the almost periodic framework concerns the case of nonlinearities which are monotone: see for instance Chapter 12 of Fink’s book [7] or the more recent and more general paper by Bostan [4], where the ful...|$|R
40|$|Eclogites and {{associated}} high-pressure (HP) rocks in collisional and accretionary orogenic belts preserve {{a record of}} subduction and exhumation, and provide a key constraint on the tectonic evolution of the continents. Most eclogites that formed at high pressures but low temperatures at > 10 - 11 kbar and 450 - 650 degrees C {{can be interpreted as}} a result of subduction of cold oceanic lithosphere. A new <b>class</b> of high-temperature (<b>HT)</b> eclogites that formed above 900 degrees C and at 14 to 30 kbar occurs in the deep continental crust, but their geodynamic significance and processes of formation are poorly understood. Here we show that Neoarchaean mafic-ultramafic complexes in the central granulite facies region of the Lewisian in NW Scotland contain HP/HT garnet-bearing granulites (retrogressed eclogites), gabbros, Iherzolites, and websterites, and that the HP granulites have garnets that contain inclusions of omphacite. From thermodynamic modeling and compositional isopleths we calculate that peak eclogite-facies metamorphism took place at 24 - 22 kbar and 1060 - 1040 degrees C. The geochemical signature of one (G- 21) of the samples shows a strong depletion of Eu indicating magma fractionation at a crustal level. The Sm-Nd isochron ages of HP phases record different cooling ages of ca. 2480 and 2330 Ma. We suggest that the layered mafic-ultramafic complexes, which may have formed in an oceanic environment, were subducted to eclogite depths, and exhumed as HP garnet-bearing orogenic peridotites. The layered complexes were engulfed by widespread orthogneisses of tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) composition with granulite facies assemblages. We propose two possible tectonic models: (1) the fact that the relicts of eclogitic complexes are so widespread in the Scourian can be taken as evidence that a > 90 km x 40 km-size slab of continental crust containing mafic-ultramafic complexes was subducted to at least 70 km depth in the late Archaean. During exhumation the gneiss protoliths were retrogressed to granulite facies assemblages, but the mafic-ultramafic rocks resisted retrogression. (2) The layered complexes of mafic and ultramafic rocks were subducted to eclogite-facies depths and during exhumation under crustal conditions they were intruded by the orthogneiss protoliths (TTG) that were metamorphosed in the granulite facies. Apart from poorly defined UHP metamorphic rocks in Norway, the retrogressed eclogites in the central granulite/retrogressed eclogite facies Lewisian region, NW Scotland have the highest crustal pressures so far reported for Archaean rocks, and demonstrate that lithospheric subduction was transporting crustal rocks to HP depths in the Neoarchaean.
