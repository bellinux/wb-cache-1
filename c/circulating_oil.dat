40|$|Mobile air {{conditioning}} <b>circulating</b> <b>oil</b> concentration and compressor start-up torque were experimentally investigated {{to develop a}} control strategy to improve compressor reliability. An installed electronic expansion valve provided the control actuation. Realtime <b>circulating</b> <b>oil</b> concentration data were obtained for steady-state, quasi-steady, and start-up operating regimes with an installed optical concentration sensor. A two-phase refrigerant-oil model was developed for R 134 a and polyalkylene glycol (PAG) oil to predict oil film thickness, average film velocity, and interfacial shear between the refrigerant vapor and the refrigerant-oil liquid film. Experimental and model results were analyzed and compared. Evaporator superheat reduced the <b>circulating</b> <b>oil</b> concentration due {{to an increase in}} the oil film thickness {{on the walls of the}} evaporator and suction line. The model predicted oil film thickness to increase by a factor of four as refrigerant quality approaches one. Increasing the refrigerant-mass flow rate only exhibited secondary effects due to slightly thinner oil films and a correspondingly higher <b>circulating</b> <b>oil</b> concentration. The influences of charge distribution, expansion valve position, compressor head pressure, and refrigerant charge level on start-up torque and initial capacity were investigated. Closing the expansion valve while the compressor clutch is disengaged was found to reduce the start-up torque by retaining the refrigerant in the system high side and preserving a pressure gradient across the expansion valve.

40|$|Shortcomings in {{the present}} {{standard}} method of determining the <b>circulating</b> <b>oil</b> concentration in a refrigeration system {{have led to the}} current research, wherein a continuous, in-line method of measuring the flowing oil concentration is sought;A literature survey and preliminary property measurements examined properties of oil-refrigerant mixtures that could be measured to infer the oil concentration in the liquid line of a refrigeration system. Four measurement methods were selected for development into oil concentration sensors: a vibrating U-tube densimeter, a new type of in-line viscometer, a prototype acoustic velocity probe, and an optical fiber refractometer;A flow loop capable of simulating a wide variety of liquid-line conditions was constructed for the testing and calibration of the oil concentration sensors. Performance tests of the densimeter, viscometer, and acoustic velocity sensor were conducted over an oil concentration range of 0 to 30 weight-percent for 150 SUS naphthenic oil/R- 12, 150 SUS naphthenic oil/R- 22, and 150 SUS alkylbenzene oil/R- 502 mixtures. The temperatures in the flow loop test section during the performance tests were varied from 70 to 120 F and the pressure was maintained to provide approximately 3 F subcooling. Performance testing of the refractometer was not completed because of severe probe temperature sensitivity and poor repeatability;The performance test results were statistically analyzed to determine the oil concentration measurement uncertainty.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} condition monitoring {{in the manufacturing}} industry has prompted many {{new developments in the}} area. While some have focused on different ways of processing monitored data, few have touched the subject of the communication network components, protocols, and standards used in monitoring networks. Additionally, monitoring systems have traditionally been built on top of existing network architectures further complicating the factory floor network by introducing additional communication protocols. At the same time, Web Service based solutions have been implemented in the upper levels of the manufacturing industry, namely the corporate network. Proposals implementing Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based approaches that ease the communication exchange for scheduling, ERP and MES systems have been created. While the use of this technology has brought many improvements, the extent of the potential benefits that Web Services can provide have been limited by the scope to which they have been applied to. This thesis proposes a solution that brings the SOA paradigm to the lower levels by utilizing Web-Service embedded intelligent devices. It does so by analyzing the particular case of the lubrication flow monitoring systems used in the paper industry. The fact that the average paper machine requires anything between 600 and 1500 lubrication points presents a unique opportunity to implement a Web Service based system where {{there is a need to}} monitor huge amounts of sensors and flowmeters in a distributed manner. Lastly, this thesis evaluates existing <b>circulating</b> <b>oil</b> flow monitoring architectures, and uses this analysis to propose a potential improvement that brings Web Services to the condition monitoring arena. Tests that evaluate the performance parameters of intelligent Web Service capable devices, and their results are presented. The reliability and overall behavior of the proposed system is analyzed and scrutinized. /Kir 1...|$|E
40|$|In HVAC and {{refrigeration}} systems, a {{small portion}} of the oil circulates with the refrigerant flow through the cycle components, while most of the oil stays in the compressor. The <b>circulating</b> <b>oil</b> can form a fairly homogeneous mixture with the liquid refrigerant, or it can exist as a separate oil-rich film inside the small tubes and headers of a microchannel heat exchanger; the amount of oil held up is affected by the system conditions. The oil retention in the microchannel type condenser is of particular interest as the amount of oil in excess in this component affects the heat transfer capacity and increases the frictional pressure losses. This paper presents a new physics-based model of the oil retention in microchannel-type condensers. The model calculates the local thermodynamic properties in each section for the refrigerant R- 410 A and Polyester (POE) oil mixture based on the local oil concentration, pressure, temperature, and mass flux. Then the model, which was experimentally validated, predicts the refrigerant-side heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop. The simulation results indicated that the pressure losses increased by over 20 % when the oil mass flow rate fraction increased up to 5 weight percent. The augmented mixture viscosity resulted in high frictional pressure drops and shear stress during the two phase flow condensation. The refrigerant side correlations were validated against literature data for in-tube two-phase flow condensation but further investigation is needed for the single-phase annular type flow in microchannel with refrigerant vapor and oil. At low degree of superheat the heat transfer coefficient of the refrigerant and oil mixture was basically unaffected by the oil mass fraction up to 3 weight percent. When the oil mass fraction was higher than 3 weight percent, then the heat transfer capacity of the condenser decreased. At high degree of superheat, the heat transfer coefficient of the oil and refrigerant mixture was penalized when the Oil Mass Fraction (OMF) was higher than 2 weight percent. Further investigation is needed on the suitability and accuracy of the heat transfer coefficients correlations to be adopted with superheated vapor refrigerant and lubricant film in annular flow at the inlet section of the microchannel type condenser...|$|E
