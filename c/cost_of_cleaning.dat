It is based at the County Offices in Newland, Lincoln. Navenby has one representative on this council, Marianne Overton, who also represents Branston ward. Following the election of May 2010, Navenby is represented at government level by Stephen Phillips, the Conservative MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham constituency.

25|$|From 1919 to 1989, Raymark {{manufactured}} {{brake pads}} and other friction {{products for the}} automobile industry under the name Raybestos. The company disposed of wastes containing lead, asbestos, PCBs and other hazardous substances at its Stratford manufacturing plant. Raymark dried the waste material and made it available for use as fill material for lawns, playgrounds, and schoolyards. In 1993, the EPA and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection began working together to complete the cleanup of contamination Raymark left behind in Stratford. EPA completed its cleanup of the contaminated residential properties in 1995 and the former Raymark plant property in 1997. Plans for cleanup of the Ferry Creek area and surrounding properties where additional Raymark waste was historically disposed are currently being developed by the EPA. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> up the Raymark Site is estimated to have exceeded $200 million.|$|E

2500|$|In his memoirs, Lee Kuan Yew recounted that {{as early}} as 1983, {{when he was still}} serving as Prime Minister, a {{proposal}} for the ban was brought up to him by the then Minister for National Development. Chewing gum was causing serious maintenance problems in high-rise public housing flats, with vandals disposing of spent gum in mailboxes, inside keyholes and even on lift buttons. Chewing gum left on the ground, stairways and pavements in public areas increased the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> and damaged cleaning equipment. Gum stuck on the seats of public buses was also considered a problem. However, Lee thought that a ban would be [...] "too drastic" [...] and did not take action.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT) The <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> {{fine coal}} are {{substantially}} {{higher than those}} <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> coarse coal. Therefore, many many coal companies in the U. S. choose to discard fine coal (150 micron x 0) by means of 6 -inch diameter hydrocyclones. The cyclone overflows are stored in fine coal impoundments, which create environmental concerns and represent loss of valuable national resources. The major component <b>of</b> the high <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> fine coal {{is associated with the}} difficulty in fine coal dewatering. Therefore, the availability of efficient of fine coal dewatering methods will greatly benefit companies In the present study, three different novel dewatering aids have been tested. These include Reagents W (RW), Reagent U (RU), and Reagent V (RV). These reagents are designed to increase the contact angles of the coal samples to be dewatered, which should help decrease the Laplace pressure of the water trapped in filter cake and, hence, increase dewatering rate. They were tested on i) the fresh coal samples from Consolidation Coal Corporation’s Buchanan Preparation Plant, ii) a composite drill core sample from the Smith Branch Impoundment, Pinnacle Mine Mining Company, and iii) a blend of coal...|$|R

50|$|Pollution of {{the public}} {{resources}} is really not a different action, it just is a reverse tragedy of the commons, in that instead of taking something out, something is put into the commons. When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into {{the cost of the}} items consumed, then it becomes only natural to pollute, as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons. So, the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it, through taxes or fines, more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> the waste before discharge.|$|E

50|$|The <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> up lead is {{far less}} than the amount the damages of lead will {{accumulate}} to.

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in minimising {{the environmental impact of}} food processes is minimising the waste and cost associated with cleaning. Cleaning is necessary because of the rapid formation of fouling deposit inside process plant and the need to changeover between products. We have recently [1] suggested a classification <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> in which the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> are mapped against the types of deposit. The aim of this work is to identify how to relate the <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> one material to that of another, since at present the design <b>of</b> <b>cleaning</b> processes is largely empirical. A series of experimental studies are described in which the <b>cleaning</b> <b>of</b> three types of deposit are studied to identify the critical factors which in each case lead to a finally clean surface.

We test these predictions empirically using data on outcomes in federal Superfund cases.
