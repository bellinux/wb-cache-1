50|$|A torque {{converter}} cannot achieve 100 percent coupling efficiency. The classic three element {{torque converter}} has an efficiency curve that resembles ∩: zero efficiency at stall, generally increasing efficiency during the acceleration phase and low efficiency in the <b>coupling</b> <b>phase.</b> The loss of efficiency as the converter enters the <b>coupling</b> <b>phase</b> {{is a result}} of the turbulence and fluid flow interference generated by the stator, and as previously mentioned, is commonly overcome by mounting the stator on a one-way clutch.|$|E
50|$|Stator clutch seizure: The {{inner and}} outer {{elements}} of the one-way stator clutch become permanently locked together, thus preventing the stator from rotating during the <b>coupling</b> <b>phase.</b> Most often, seizure is precipitated by severe loading and subsequent distortion of the clutch components. Eventually, galling of the mating parts occurs, which triggers seizure. A converter with a seized stator clutch will exhibit very poor efficiency during the <b>coupling</b> <b>phase,</b> and in a motor vehicle, fuel consumption will drastically increase. Converter overheating under such conditions will usually occur if continued operation is attempted.|$|E
50|$|During {{the stall}} and {{acceleration}} phases, in which torque multiplication occurs, the stator remains stationary {{due to the}} action of its one-way clutch. However, as the torque converter approaches the <b>coupling</b> <b>phase,</b> the energy and volume of the fluid returning from the turbine will gradually decrease, causing pressure on the stator to likewise decrease. Once in the <b>coupling</b> <b>phase,</b> the returning fluid will reverse direction and now rotate {{in the direction of}} the impeller and turbine, an effect which will attempt to forward-rotate the stator. At this point, the stator clutch will release and the impeller, turbine and stator will all (more or less) turn as a unit.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to dynamically simple periodic attractors {{with varying degrees}} of clustering, the emergent dynamics of <b>coupled</b> <b>phase</b> oscillator systems such as (32) can be remarkably complex even in the case of global coupling and similar effects can appear {{in a wide range of}} coupled systems. In the case of globally <b>coupled</b> <b>phase</b> oscillators, the dynamical complexity depends only on the phase interaction function H and the number of oscillators N. Chaotic dynamics [243] can appear in four or more globally <b>coupled</b> <b>phase</b> oscillators for phase interaction functions of sufficient complexity. We focus now on attractors that are robust and apparently prevalent in many such systems: robust heteroclinic attractors.|$|R
40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} work on sound propagation in suspensions and emulsions is reviewed. Three theoretical approaches are identified: scattering theory, <b>coupled</b> <b>phase</b> theory and porous media theory. <b>Coupled</b> <b>phase</b> theory is extended and compared analytically and numerically to scattering and porous media theory. Important regimes of scattering theory - the lossless and viscothermal scattering, single and multiple scattering and incoherent scattering regimes - are examined. Experimental data {{is used to}} corroborate lossless multiple scattering theory in the short wavelength, high volume fraction region. Previous <b>coupled</b> <b>phase</b> theories have modelled sound propagation in two phase media (i) with heat transfer assuming incompressible particles and (ii) with a compressible particulate phase neglecting heat transfer. Type (i) models are examined analytically and compared to scattering theory. Types (i) and (ii) are compared and brought together in a more general <b>coupled</b> <b>phase</b> theory. The new theory provides an alternative model to scattering theory for sound propagation in emulsions. Predictions of the new theory are compared to experimental data and predictions of scattering theory. Conditions for the equivalence of the frameless Biot porous media theory and <b>coupled</b> <b>phase</b> theory are identified. Predictions of the two approaches are compared to experimental data. New measurements of pore size distribution are used to predict measured acoustical properties of air saturated glass beads. Other extensions to <b>coupled</b> <b>phase</b> theory are reviewed and developed. Predictions including the effect of high volume fraction on the drag and the induced mass force are compared to experimental data and predictions of porous media theory. <b>Coupled</b> <b>phase</b> theory including heat transfer is extended to include particle size distributions; predictions of tl-ds are compared to measurements. The effect of non-spherical particles is investigated. Using the theory of Culick, frequency shifts for modes in an enclosure into which a suspension has been introduced are calculated. These are compared to the predictions of an intuitive approach. The method of Margulies and Schwartz for modelling particle diffusion is discussed. Areas where further work is required are identified. ...|$|R

50|$|The Dynaflow was an {{inherently}} inefficient design {{due to its}} sole reliance on the torque converter in normal driving. Exacerbating the situation was the dual stator arrangement, which wasted more power than the simpler three element converters used with other automatic transmissions, such as Chrysler's TorqueFlite. The multiple stators increased turbulence in the converter, even when operating in the <b>coupling</b> <b>phase.</b>|$|E
50|$|Even {{with the}} benefit of the one-way stator clutch, a {{converter}} cannot achieve the same level of efficiency in the <b>coupling</b> <b>phase</b> as an equivalently sized fluid coupling. Some loss is due to the presence of the stator (even though rotating as part of the assembly), as it always generates some power-absorbing turbulence. Most of the loss, however, is caused by the curved and angled turbine blades, which do not absorb kinetic energy from the fluid mass as well as radially straight blades. Since the turbine blade geometry is a crucial factor in the converter's ability to multiply torque, trade-offs between torque multiplication and coupling efficiency are inevitable. In automotive applications, where steady improvements in fuel economy have been mandated by market forces and government edict, the nearly universal use of a lock-up clutch has helped to eliminate the converter from the efficiency equation during cruising operation. The maximum amount of torque multiplication produced by a converter is highly dependent on the size and geometry of the turbine and stator blades, and is generated only when the converter is at or near the stall phase of operation. Typical stall torque multiplication ratios range from 1.8:1 to 2.5:1 for most automotive applications (although multi-element designs as used in the Buick Dynaflow and Chevrolet Turboglide could produce more). Specialized converters designed for industrial, rail, or heavy marine power transmission systems are capable of as much as 5.0:1 multiplication. Generally speaking, there is a trade-off between maximum torque multiplication and efficiency - high stall ratio converters tend to be relatively inefficient below the coupling speed, whereas low stall ratio converters tend to provide less possible torque multiplication.|$|E

For larger detuning, we find pronounced oscillations of the output intensity. The frequency of oscillation shows a stair-like behavior which depends on the detuning frequency, the coupling time and the <b>coupling</b> <b>phase.</b> In addition, the <b>coupling</b> <b>phase</b> also affects the oscillation frequency and the phase relation between the two oscillating lasers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Phase {{noise in}} {{mutually}} synchronized oscillator sys-tems is analyzed for arbitrary coupling and injection-locking topologies, neglecting amplitude noise, and amplitude modulation (AM) to phase modulation (PM) conversion. When the <b>coupling</b> <b>phase</b> is chosen properly (depending on the oscillator model), the near-carrier phase noise {{is reduced to}} 1 =N that of a single oscilla-tor, provided the coupling network is reciprocal. This is proved in general, and illustrated with specific cases of globally coupled and nearest-neighbor coupled oscillator chains. A slight noise degra-dation is found for unilaterally coupled (nonreciprocal) chains. The 1 =N reduction for reciprocal coupling applies over nearly {{the entire range of}} free-running frequency distributions required for beam-scanning, and is verified experimentally using a linear chain of coupled GaAs MESFET voltage-controlled oscillators (VCO’s) operating atX-band. The effect of a nonoptimum <b>coupling</b> <b>phase</b> on the phase noise of the system is also studied. As the <b>coupling</b> <b>phase</b> deviates from the optimum value, the phase noise increases significantly near the locking range edge for noise offset frequency near the carrier.

40|$|The {{notion of}} a weak chimeras {{provides}} a tractable definition for chimera states in networks of finitely many phase oscillators.

Symmetries of solutions automatically imply angular frequency synchronization. We show that the presence of such symmetries is not necessary by giving a result for the existence of weak chimeras without instantaneous or setwise symmetries for <b>coupled</b> <b>phase</b> oscillators.

For N = 2 k + 1 oscillators we show {{that there can be}} open regions in parameter space where the heteroclinic networks have the structure of an odd graph of order k; a class of graphs known from permutation theory. These networks lead to slow sequential switching between cluster states that is driven by noise and/or imperfections in the system. The dynamics observed is of relevance to modelling the emergent complex dynamical behaviour of coupled oscillator systems, e. g. for coupled chemical oscillators and neural networks. ...|$|R

We propose goal functions based on both the difference of the oscillators and a generalized order parameter and demonstrate that the speed-gradient method allows one to find appropriate coupling phases with which different states of synchronization, e. g., in-phase oscillation, splay or various cluster states, can be selected.

Here we show that nonpairwise coupling-including three and four-way interactions of the oscillator phases-that appears generically at the next order in normal-form based calculations can give rise to complex emergent dynamics in symmetric phase oscillator networks.

40|$|We study {{networks}} of <b>coupled</b> <b>phase</b> oscillators {{and show that}} network architecture can force relations between average frequencies of the oscillators. The main tool of our analysis is coupled cell theory developed by Stewart, Golubitsky, Pivato, and TÄorÄok, which provides precise relations between network architecture and the corresponding class of ODEs in RM, and gives conditions for the °ow-invariance of certain polydiag-onal subspaces for all coupled systems with a given network architecture. The theory generalizes the notion of ¯xed-point subspaces for subgroups of network symmetries and directly extends to {{networks of}} <b>coupled</b> <b>phase</b> oscillators. For systems of <b>coupled</b> <b>phase</b> oscillators (but not generally for ODEs in RM), in-variant polydiagonal subsets of codimension one arise naturally and strongly restrict the network dynamics. We say that two oscillators i and j coevolve if the polydiagonal µi = µj is °ow-invariant and show that the average frequencies of these oscillators must be equal. Given a network architecture, it is shown that coupled cell theory provides a direct way of testing when two oscillators coevolve. We give generalization of these results to pairs of synchronous sets of phase oscillators using quotient networks, and discuss implications for networks of spiking cells and those connected through bu®ers that implement coupling dynamics. We conclude by showing how oscillators in a net-work can be partitioned into collections with closely related dynamics. 1 Running title: Networks of phase oscillator...|$|R
