5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} {{parts of the}} game's development, the largest <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{coordinate}} Guasti's and his collaborators' work; when Guasti started working as a programmer, he learned about project management, and applied it to AM2R, but still found it challenging to have deadlines and keep people motivated, as everyone {{was working on the}} game for free in their spare time. In late 2014, the project was ported to the newer version GameMaker: Studio, which enabled improved loading times and performance, but required the complete rewriting of some features and changes to the designs of some levels. This move also made bugs faster to fix and new builds easier to make, leaving the development progress in a more expedient and productive state. Later in the same year, the developers worked on improving the visuals, giving the fourth area a new graphics tile set intended to give it more personality.|$|E

Therefore, the access point must equally allocate bandwidth to each wireless client. The second <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> achieve per-flow fairness between the uplink and downlink flows within a wireless station. The third <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> adaptively adjust {{the allocation of}} the uplink and downlink bandwidth for each wireless station, {{in order to allow}} a given communication direction to obtain larger bandwidth than the other. Finally, the fourth <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> adaptively re-allocate the remaining bandwidth to bandwidth-hungry wireless stations in order to increase link utilization.|$|R

5|$|Kistiakowsky {{was unhappy}} {{with the state of}} American {{knowledge}} of explosives and propellants. Conant established the Explosives Research Laboratory (ERL) near the laboratories of the Bureau of Mines in Bruceton, Pennsylvania in October 1940, and Kistiakowsky initially supervised its activities, making occasional visits; but Conant did not formally appoint him as its Technical Director until the spring of 1941. Although initially hampered by a shortage of facilities, the ERL grew from five staff in 1941 to a wartime peak of 162 full-time laboratory staff in 1945. An important field of research was RDX. This powerful explosive had been developed by the British before the war. The <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> develop an industrial process that could produce it on a large scale. RDX was also mixed with TNT to produce Composition B, which was widely used in various munitions, and torpex, which was used in torpedoes and depth charges. Pilot plants were in operation by May 1942, and large-scale production followed in 1943.|$|E
5|$|The <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make £1million in {{a single}} year. Realising that they would {{essentially}} be making their own prize money, most contestants quit the show within two days. One group stayed together for slightly longer: sleeping {{on the floor of}} their cameraman's flat, they attempted to create their own TV show about themselves. Having also given up his flat and job, Russian was also homeless, and was forced to stay with the contestants he had manipulated. After the programme failed, Russian went into hiding, and was unable to be contacted. He was eventually tracked down by one of his victims to an address in Richmond upon Thames, where he was forced to apologise on camera. As he had not taken any money from his victims, a criminal case against Russian was not pursued—a civil case was also not pursued {{due to a lack of}} funds.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{gameplay}} is its focus on guns over swords and magic. When deciding upon the game's basics, the team {{wanted to create a}} cinematic feeling in battles. If they had gone with a more traditional battle system, then it would have quickly lost its cinematic quality due to the prevalence of close combat. Likewise, they wanted the cinematic feel to persist throughout the whole game rather than restricted to cutscenes. A major <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> strike a balance between accessibility and difficulty when developing for a player base that might be made of up of both action game and RPG players. This resulted in the addition of strategy elements. Another wish was to create something new and fresh in the RPG market. When creating the gameplay style, the team looked at action movies such as The Matrix and Rebellion during their research. Despite its fast-paced action, the game relies heavily upon strategic, turn-based gameplay. During early development, the game was based on a real-time system and meant for only one character to be controlled by the player; the other two would have been handled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). After some testing, they decided that this would create unwanted difficulties in gameplay such as characters dying off-screen without the player noticing or the AI not directing them properly.|$|E
40|$|The CSCL {{community}} faces {{two main}} challenges {{with respect to}} learning and argumentation. The scientific <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> understand how argumentation produces learning, that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> discover which cognitive mechanisms, triggered by argumentative interactions, generate new knowledge and in what conditions. The engineering <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> determine how to trigger productive argumentation among students. These two <b>challenges</b> <b>are</b> often investigated in parallel, but this contribution focuses on the latter...|$|R

5|$|Command of A Company was {{temporarily}} {{handed over to}} the second-in-command, Captain Bob Murdoch. Present at Pakchon in November 1950, O'Dowd understood first-hand the dangers of withdrawing while in contact. The <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> protect the forward platoons as they withdrew from being followed up by the Chinese occupying the old B Company positions and from D Company's position after they broke contact. The Australians would also have to clear the withdrawal route of any blocking forces, {{while at the same time}} the evacuation of a large number of wounded and Chinese prisoners would hamper their movement. As such the timing of the withdrawal would be critical to its success. Consequently, the lead company would not move until mid-afternoon so that the rearguard would be able to use the protection of darkness to break contact, while at the same time offering good observation and fields of fire during the daylight to support the initial moves. Orders were delivered at 14:30. B Company would lead the withdrawal down the ridge line, carrying any wounded that still required evacuation, as well as clearing the route and securing the ford near the Middlesex position. C Company would wait for the artillery to neutralise the Chinese on the old B Company position, before moving to establish a blocking position behind D Company. A Company would then withdraw to a blocking position behind C Company, in order to allow Gravener and Saunders to establish a clean break. Finally, D Company would withdraw through both C and A Company and set up a blocking position to delay any follow up and allow those companies to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Research for {{the film}} was done through {{available}} sources, such as online information and newspaper archives. Kom's videos {{played a key role}} in the research. The writer also had several telephone and email conversations with her regarding her biography. In her interactions with Quadras and Kumar, Kom was forthcoming when it came to the details of her life, and had significant input in the screenplay. However, Quadras revealed that his biggest <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make the film authentic and cinematic yet not documentary-like, so he wrote the film in a manner that showed the struggles Kom went through as a female sportsperson who had to confront opposition from her father, politics and making a comeback after a long career break. The film only shows the period from her early struggles and her comeback after motherhood. Her fifth World Boxing Championship win and the London Olympics were left out because of the contract that permitted a depiction of Kom's life up to 2008. The contract {{for the film}} was signed at that time when Kom had not even qualified for the London Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Treloar's first <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{improve the}} quality of the war diaries kept by AIF units. These diaries were meant to be {{maintained}} by each element of the AIF as a record of its activities for later use by historians, but at the time most units recorded few details. To this end, Treloar met with many of the officers responsible for units' war diaries and frequently provided written advice and feedback {{on the quality of the}} records submitted to the Section; these methods had previously been used by the Canadian military. Treloar also sought to motivate relevant personnel by demonstrating that the diaries were valued and would be important in ensuring that their unit received recognition for its achievements after the war. In August 1917 the AWRS expanded its activities to include collecting artefacts from the French battlefields. Its tasks increased further in September when it took over responsibility for supervising the official war artists as well as producing and keeping records of non-official publications such as regimental magazines. Individual soldiers were encouraged to contribute artefacts and records, and the AWRS provided museum labels to combat units to encourage them to record the significance and origins of items they submitted. The AWRS established field offices in France and Egypt, and reached a strength of about 600 soldiers and civilians in November 1918. From November 1917 until August 1918 the war correspondent Henry Gullett commanded the AWRS subsection in Cairo; in this role he reported directly to Treloar. As a result of the AWRS' expansion, in March 1918 its headquarters moved from the PRO building to a larger office on Horseferry Road opposite the main offices of the AIF Administrative Headquarters.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} 1882 season, in addition to appointing Hawke as captain, the committee agreed to reorganise itself {{for the first time since}} the club's foundation and began a process which eventually made the club representative of the whole county and not just Sheffield.|$|E
25|$|At the Ninth Annual MIC Conference {{that was}} held in Teluk Anson (Teluk Intan), Perak in May 1955, Tun V.T. Sambanthan was elected as the fifth President of the Malayan Indian Congress. The MIC's main <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{reconcile}} the political aspirations {{of the middle class}} with the poverty and needs of the labouring class, who in 1938 comprised 84% of the plantation labour force. Sambanthan Thevar started a recruitment campaign among plantation workers, relying on patronage of Hinduism in its popular South Indian form, increased use and fostering of the Tamil language, and Tamil cultural activities.|$|E

25|$|Senefelder had experimented {{during the}} early 19th century with {{multicolor}} lithography; in his 1819 book, he predicted that the process would eventually be perfected and used to reproduce paintings. Multi-color printing was introduced by a new process developed by Godefroy Engelmann (France) in 1837 known as chromolithography. A separate stone was used for each color, and a print went through the press separately for each stone. The main <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> keep the images aligned (in register). This method lent itself to images consisting of large areas of flat color, and resulted in the characteristic poster designs of this period.|$|E
25|$|While George Odgers' volume covered only RAAF {{operations}} against Japan, {{the other two}} authors of the Air series, and particularly John Herington, faced the challenge of covering the diverse experiences of the EATS graduates who served in over 500 British squadrons. Herington's solution to this <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> write a comprehensive short history of British air warfare, {{with a focus on}} the small number of Australian squadrons and the main activities of Australian personnel in RAF units. Gillison and Herington also wrote about how EATS operated and its implications for Australia. Herington's account of EATS is generally considered superior to that provided by Gillison, whose account is regarded as relatively uncritical of the scheme.|$|E
25|$|A major {{challenge}} for the prime ministers of the new Kingdom of Italy was integrating the political and administrative systems of the seven different major components into a unified set of policies. The different regions were proud of their own historic patterns and could not easily be fitted into the Sardinian model. Cavour started the planning, but died before it was fully developed—indeed, the challenges of administration the various bureaucracies {{are thought to have}} hastened his death. The easiest <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> harmonize the administrative bureaucracies of Italy's regions. They practically all followed the Napoleonic precedent, so harmonization was straightforward. The second <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> develop a parliamentary system. Cavour and most liberals up and down the peninsula highly admired the British system, so it became the model for Italy to this day. Harmonizing the Army and Navy were much more complex, chiefly because the systems of recruiting soldiers and selecting and promoting officers were so different and needed to be grandfathered in over decades. The disorganization helps explain why the Italian naval record in the 1866 war was so abysmal. The military system was slowly integrated over several decades. The multiple educational system likewise proved complicated for there were few common elements. Shortly before his death, Cavour appointed Francisco De Sanctus as minister of education. De Sanctus was an eminent scholar from the University of Naples who proved an able and patient administrator. The addition of Veneto in 1866 and Rome in 1870 further complicated the challenges of bureaucratic coordination.|$|E
40|$|At their worst, {{fires at}} the rural–urban or wildland–urban {{interface}} cause tragic loss of human lives and homes, but mitigating these fire effects through management elicits many social and scientific challenges. This paper addresses four interconnected management challenges posed by socially disastrous landscape fires. The issues concern various assets (particularly houses, {{human life and}} biodiversity), fuel treatments, and fire and human behaviours. The topics considered are: 'asset protection zones'; 'defensible space' and urban fire spread in relation to house ignition and loss; 'stay-or-go' policy and the prediction of time available for safe egress and the possible conflict between the creation of defensible space and wildland management objectives. The first scientific <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> model the effective width of an asset protection zone of an urban area. The second <b>is</b> <b>to</b> consider the effect of vegetation around a house, potentially defensible space, on fire arrival at the structure. The third scientific <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> present stakeholders with accurate information on rates of spread, and where the fire front is located, so as {{to allow them to}} plan safe egress or preparation time in their particular circumstances. The fourth scientific <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> predict the effects of fires on wildland species composition. Associated with each scientific <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> a social challenge: for the first two scientific challenges the social <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> co-ordinate fuel management within and between the urban and rural or wildland sides of the interface. For the third scientific challenge, the social <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware of, and appropriately use, fire danger information so that the potential for safe egress from a home can be estimated most accurately. Finally, the fourth social <b>challenge</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> for local residents of wildland–urban interfaces with an interest in biodiversity conservation to understand the effects of fire regimes on biodiversity, thereby assisting hard-pressed wildland managers to make informed choices...|$|R

25|$|Macroeconomic {{stability}} {{coupled with}} relatively slow economic growth characterized the Moroccan economy {{over the period}} 2000–2005. The government introduced {{a number of important}} economic reforms in that period. The economy, however, remained overly dependent on the agricultural sector. Morocco's primary economic <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> accelerate growth in order to reduce high levels of unemployment. The government continued liberalizing the telecommunications sector in 2002, as well as the rules for oil and gas exploration. This process started with the sale of a second GSM license in 1999. The government in 2003 was using revenue from privatizations to finance increased spending. Although Morocco's economy grew in the early 2000s, it was not enough to significantly reduce poverty.|$|E
25|$|On 9 February 2007, Branson {{announced}} the setting up {{of a new}} global science and technology prize—The Virgin Earth Challenge—in the belief that history has shown that prizes of this nature encourage technological advancements {{for the good of}} mankind.

This removal must have long-term effects and contribute materially to the stability of the Earth's climate. Branson also announced that he would be joined in the adjudication of the prize by a panel of five judges, all world authorities in their respective fields: Al Gore, Sir Crispin Tickell, Tim Flannery, James E. Hansen, and James Lovelock.|$|E
25|$|The {{city had}} a {{deepwater}} port. In the early 19th century, many business leaders in Maryland were looking inland, toward the western frontier, {{for economic growth}} potential. The <b>challenge</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> devise a reliable means to transport goods and people. The National Road and private turnpikes were being completed throughout the state, but additional routes and capacity were needed. Following {{the success of the}} Erie Canal (constructed 1817–25) and similar canals in the northeastern states, leaders in Maryland were also developing plans for canals. After several failed canal projects in the Washington, D.C. area, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C) began construction there in 1828. The Baltimore business community viewed this project as a competitive threat. The geography of the Baltimore area made building a similar canal to the west impractical, but the idea of constructing railroads was beginning to gather support in the 1820s.|$|E
