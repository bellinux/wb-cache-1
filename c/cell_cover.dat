40|$|The {{objective}} of the Hall effect thruster plume contamination and erosion study was to evaluate {{the impact of a}} xenon ion plume on various samples placed in the vicinity of a Hall effect thruster for a continuous 100 hour exposure. NASA Glenn Research Center was responsible for the pre- and post-test evaluation of three sample types placed around the thruster: solar <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> glass, RTV silicone, and Kapton(R). Mass and profilometer), were used to identify the degree of deposition and/or erosion on the solar <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> glass, RTV silicone, and Kapton@ samples. Transmittance, reflectance, solar absorptance, and room temperature emittance were used to identify the degree of performance degradation of the solar <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> glass samples alone. Auger spectroscopy was used to identify the chemical constituents found {{on the surface of the}} exposed solar <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> glass samples. Chemical analysis indicated some boron nitride contamination on the samples, from boron nitride insulators used in the body of the thruster. However, erosion outweighted contamination. All samples exhibited some degree of erosion. with the most erosion occurring near the centerline of the plume and the least occurring at the +/- 90 deg positions. For the solar <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> glass samples, erosion progressed through the antireflective coating and into the microsheet glass itself. Erosion occurred in the solar <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> glass, RTV silicone and Kapton(R) at different rates. All optical properties changed with the degree of erosion, with solar absorptance and room temperature emittance increasing with erosion. The transmittance of some samples decreased while the reflectance of some samples increased and others decreased. All results are consistent with an energetic plume of xenon ions serving as a source for erosion...|$|E

Potential changes are evaluated by performing a sensitivity analysis of the relative impact of root penetrations on radon flux out of the <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> and/or water infiltration into the <b>cell</b> <b>cover.</b> Data used in this analysis consist of existing information on vegetation growth on selected <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> systems and information available from published studies and/or other available project research. Consistent with the scope of this paper, no new site-specific data were collected from UMTRA Project sites. Further, this paper does not focus on the issue of plant transport of radon gas or other contaminants out of the disposal <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> though it is acknowledged that such transport {{has the potential to be}} a significant pathway for contaminants to reach the environment during portions of the design life of a disposal cell where plant growth occurs. Rather, this study was performed to evaluate the effects of physical penetration and soil drying caused by plant roots that have and are expected to continue to grow in UMTRA Project disposal cell covers. An understanding of the biological and related physical processes that take place within the cover systems of the UMTRA Project disposal cells helps the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) determine if the presence of a plant community on these cells is detrimental, beneficial, or of mixed value in terms of the cover system`s designed function.

40|$|In classic {{monolayer}} cell culture, {{the world}} is flat. In contrast, tissue-embedded cells experience a three-dimensional context to interact with. We assessed a selection of natural gelling agents of non-animal origin (ι- and κ-carrageenan, gellan gum, guar gum, locust bean gum, sodium alginate, tragacanth and xanthan gum) in serum-free medium at 1 – 4 % (w/v) concentration for their suitability as a more natural 3 D culture environment for brain-derived cells. Their biophysical properties (viscosity, texture, transparency, gelling propensity) resemble those of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Gels provide the neurons with a 3 D scaffold to interact with and allow for an increase of the overall cell density compared to classical monolayer 2 D culture. They not only protect neurons in cell culture from shear forces and medium evaporation, but stabilize the microenvironment around them for efficient glial proliferation, tissue-analog neural differentiation and neural communication. We report on their properties (viscosity, transparency), their ease of handling in a cell culture context and their possible use modalities (cell embedment, as a <b>cell</b> <b>cover</b> or as a cell culture substrate). Among the selected gels, guar gum and locust bean gum with intercalated laminin allowed for cortical cell embedment. Neurons plated on and migrating into gellan gum survived and differentiated even without the addition of laminin. Sodium alginate with laminin was a suitable <b>cell</b> <b>cover.</b> Finally, we exemplarily demonstrate how guar gum supported the functional survival of a cortical culture {{over a period of}} 79 days in a proof-of-concept long-term microelectrode array (MEA) electrophysiology study...|$|E
