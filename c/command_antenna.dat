50|$|December 1990 was an {{important}} {{time in the history}} of the TOS. The Galileo probe (launched October 1989) was scheduled for a flyby of Earth before proceeding with its mission, but NASA was having trouble acquiring the satellite to verify/correct its position. Failure to command the satellite and/or confirm its current/planned flight path could cause mission failure. In an effort to find the probe, NASA sent out a call for help to United States Space Command, asking the military to use its space surveillance network to try to find the satellite. Once found, NASA could point their <b>commanding</b> <b>antennas</b> to the proper location and reacquire the satellite to ensure successful mission continuation. Communication from Space Command to its subordinate units requested support from any sensors in the network that could potentially track the probe.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} digital {{controller}} for a relatively complicated antenna system which contains several nonlinearities and is of a degree of complexity which makes a mathematical analysis of the control problem extremely difficult if not impossible. The problem was approached by first simulating the system on a hybrid computer. Then, before the implementation of the experimental controller, attempts were made to obtain a representative mathematical model which {{could be used as a}} yard stick to measure the digital controller performance against a theoretical optimum. A simplified model which gave satisfactory outputs for a variety of step inputs was obtained. The state equations were derived from this model and used in attempts to determine the theoretical optimum control for a step input command to the system. Two methods were used but both failed to yield useful results. Thus, instead of employing the theoretical solution as a standard of performance, a graphical approach was taken. It was found that the control system was velocity limited for large step inputs. The graph of the position error of the system with a bang-bang controller thus represented an easily understood and relatively precise measure of the degree by which other control schemes fell short of achieving a true optimal control. The type of control algorithm which was developed is easy to implement and has an almost minimum time response with no overshoot for step input <b>commands.</b> <b>Antenna</b> velocity is normally zero at both endpoints. In addition the algorithm makes possible the elimination of the compensation network. This is presently used to condition the command signals which are passed from the computer to the control system...|$|R

The RLSA antenna elements are slot pairs located on concentric circles on the top plate of a radial waveguide.

A technique is therefore developed for synthesizing such an RLSA antenna. Keywords: Antennas, Radial Line Slot Antennas, Isoflux Radiation Pattern...|$|R

As the craft moved closer to Mars, the Sun and Earth moved closer in the sky as viewed from the craft, so less energy reached Earth.

A recursion is formulated using a stochastic signed gradient approximation, where the receiver employs a single feedback bit to <b>command</b> the transmit <b>antenna</b> weights adaptation, at a frequency {{much lower than}} that of the data rate. The algorithm tracks the weight vector that optimizes a link performance measure, which takes into account both the self-interference properties of the space-time code and the channel conditions.

40|$|The LQG controllers, {{designed}} for the NASA Deep Space Network antennas have small tracking errors and are resistant to wind disturbances. However, during antenna slewing, they induce limit cycling caused by the violation of the antenna rate and acceleration limits. This problem can be avoided by introduction of a command that does not exceed the limits. The command preprocessor {{presented in this paper}} generates a command that is equal to the original command if the latter does not exceed the limits, and varies with the maximal (or minimal) allowable rate and acceleration if the limits are met or exceeded. It is comparatively simple since it requires only knowledge of the command at the current and the previous time instants, while other known preprocessors require knowledge of the terminal state and the acquisition time. Thus, the presented preprocessor is more suitable for implementation. In this article analysis of the preprocessor is presented. Also the performances of the preprocessor itself, and of the antenna with the preprocessor is illustrated with typical <b>antenna</b> <b>commands...</b>|$|R
40|$|The X-band Acquisition Aid (AAP) {{software}} is a low-cost acquisition {{aid for the}} Deep Space Network (DSN) antennas, and is used while acquiring a spacecraft shortly after it has launched. When enabled, the acquisition aid provides corrections to the antenna-predicted trajectory of the spacecraft {{to compensate for the}} variations that occur during the actual launch. The AAP software also provides the corrections to the antenna-predicted trajectory to the navigation team that uses the corrections to refine their model of the spacecraft in order to produce improved antenna-predicted trajectories for each spacecraft that passes over each complex. The software provides an automated Acquisition Aid receiver calibration, and provides graphical displays to the operator and remote viewers via an Ethernet connection. It has a Web server, and the remote workstations use the Firefox browser to view the displays. At any given time, only one operator can control any particular display in order to avoid conflicting commands from more than one control point. The configuration and control is accomplished solely via the graphical displays. The operator does not have to remember any commands. Only a few configuration parameters need to be changed, and can be saved to the appropriate spacecraft-dependent configuration file on the AAP s hard disk. AAP automates the calibration sequence by first <b>commanding</b> the <b>antenna</b> to the correct position, starting the receiver calibration sequence, and then providing the operator with the option of accepting or rejecting the new calibration parameters. If accepted, the new parameters are stored in the appropriate spacecraft-dependent configuration file. The calibration can be performed on the Sun, greatly expanding the window of opportunity for calibration. The spacecraft traditionally used for calibration is in view typically twice per day, and only for about ten minutes each pass...|$|R
40|$|Small {{satellites}} require {{small and}} lightweight antennas for telemetry and command function {{as well as}} for downlinking of data. We have during the last thirty years developed a large suite of wide coverage antennas. The basic radiator designs used are quadrifilar helices, waveguides, horns and patch excited cups (PEC) depending on frequency range, coverage requirements and application. The antenna designs range from L-band up to Ka-band frequencies. Typical coverages for the antennas are from low gain hemispherical, isoflux, fill-in, toroidal to medium gain, global and semiglobal coverage antennas. The paper gives a brief overview of the antenna family and a selection of recently developed and interesting antennas is presented more in detail. L-band antennas have been developed for satellite-born GPS receivers and for earth observation satellite downlinks. Two recently developed GPS antennas are presented together with a complementary LNA. One is a helix antenna, an antenna type of which we have a hughe experience, the other a PEC antenna. Several PEC antennas have been designed through the years. This radiator type can be used either as a complementary fill-in antenna or as a free-standing medium-gain antenna for telemetry and <b>command.</b> Three S-band <b>antenna</b> developments are presented.

Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology has selected TRW to buiId U. S. spacecraft for the joint mission. The dual spacecraft will fly to Jupiter and use that planet’s greater gravitational field to achieve a near 90 degree orbit change, placing the two spacecraft on separate trajectories to the North and South poles of the Sun from a high heliographic vantage point. The antenna subsystem of the ISPM spacecraft consists of S-/X band high gain, S-band broad coverage, and X-Band medium gain <b>antenna.</b> <b>Command</b> and ranging signals are received by the S-band high-gain and broad-coverage antennas. Scientific and engineering data are transmitted by these two antennas and the X-band high-gain antenna. Conscan acquisition is by the two S-band antennas. Emergency transmissions are by the S-band broad coverage and X-band medium-gain antennas. The S-/X-band HGA is a 1. 9 meter (78 inches) diameter dual reflector Cassegrain design with a dichroic subreflector. The Cassegrain mode is excited by an efficient dual mode conical horn whose dimensions have been optimized to provide high-gain performance for X-Band. The S-band feed, located directly behind the frequency selective subreflector, illuminates the parabolic reflector as a focal point feed, laterally displaced by 2. 29 cm (0. 9 inch) to provide conscan signals with a 1 dB crossover level. The selected configuration permits the use of a common antenna for both X- and S-band functions and utilizes previously developed TRW hardware. The selected design represents the largest non-deployable antenna that could be accommodated by shuttle/IUS and spacecraft physical interfaces. An x-ray XUV telescope (CXX) is located on the center of the spacecraf t which is despun about the spacecraft +Z axis. The ends of the coronograph cast shadows onto the edge of the reflector up to 9. 72 cm (3. 83 inches) inside the reflector.
