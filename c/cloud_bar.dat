40|$|We present here dust {{models for}} the Small Magellanic <b>Cloud</b> <b>bar</b> {{calculated}} {{for the first time}} with the regularization approach. A simple mixture of the core-mantle and/or composite grains (mostly made from silicates and organic refractory) together with silicon nanoparticles is consistent with the following: 1) the observed extinction toward AzV 398 (a typical SMC bar sightline), 2) the elemental abundances, and 3) the strength of the interstellar radiation field. We predict the expected albedo and asymmetry parameter of the models, which can be tested in future observations. The proposed dust models can also be tested by looking for the expected extended red emission.

40|$|A {{thorough}} {{analysis of}} the OGLE-II time-series photometry of the Large Magellanic <b>Cloud</b> <b>bar</b> supplemented by similar data from the MACHO database led us {{to the discovery of}} three Beta Cephei-type stars. These are the first known extragalactic Beta Cephei-type stars. Two of the three stars are multiperiodic. Two stars have inferred masses of about 10 Mo while the third is about 2 mag brighter and at least twice as massive. All three variables are located in or very close to the massive and young LMC associations (LH 41, 59 and 81). It is therefore very probable that the variables have higher than average metallicities. This would reconcile our finding with theoretical predictions of the shape and location of the Beta Cephei instability strip in the H-R diagram. The low number of Beta Cephei stars found in the LMC is another observational confirmation of strong dependence of the mechanism driving pulsations in these variables on metallicity. Follow-up spectroscopic determination of the metallicities in the discovered variables will provide a good test for the theory of pulsational stability in massive main-sequence stars.

40|$|We {{examine the}} biases {{inherent}} to chemical abundance distributions when targets are {{selected from the}} red giant branch (RGB), using simulated giant branches created from isochrones. We find that even when stars are chosen from the entire colour range of RGB stars and over {{a broad range of}} magnitudes, the relative numbers of stars of different ages and metallicities, integrated over all stellar types, are not accurately represented in the giant branch sample. The result is that metallicity distribution functions derived from RGB star samples require a correction before they can be fit by chemical evolution models. We derive simple correction factors for over- and under-represented populations for the limiting cases of single-age populations with a broad range of metallicities and of continuous star formation at constant metallicity; an important general conclusion is that intermediate-age populations (~ 1 - 4 Gyr) are over-represented in RGB samples. We apply our models to the case of the Large Magellanic <b>Cloud</b> <b>bar</b> and show that the observed metallicity distribution underestimates the true number of metal-poor stars by more than 25 %; as a result, the inferred importance of gas flows in chemical evolution models could potentially be overestimated. The age- and metallicity-dependences of RGB lifetimes require careful modelling if they are not to lead to spurious conclusions about the chemical enrichment history of galaxies.

40|$|The Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1241 {{presents}} a 1. 5 kpc large circumnuclear ring (CNR) {{of star formation}} embracing a small bar plus leading arms. Those structures are Paα emitters but barely seen in Haα. It also presents stellar trailing arms inside the CNR. Gemini and HST imagery allow the construction of high-resolution (V−H) and (J−K) color maps, {{as well as a}} (J−K) versus K color-magnitude diagram of this complex region. The CNR s s is heavily obscured in V, but a fairly transparent window appears {{in the direction of the}} nucleus. Nonetheless, the nucleus {{presents a}} (J−K) color that is redder than the CNR. The CNR is composed of extremely young s H II regions still enshrouded in their dust cocoons. However, the nuclear (J−K) color cannot be explained in s this manner. Therefore, we propose the contribution of C stars as the most feasible mechanism for explaining the colors. If the nuclear stellar population is comparable to that of the Large Magellanic <b>Cloud</b> <b>bar,</b> 500 C stars and 25, 000 asymptotic giant branch O-rich stars inside 50 pc may reproduce the observed colors. C stars release enriched material to the nuclear environment, probably fueling the central engine of this Seyfert 2 galaxy during the lifetime of stars with masses in the range 2 Mʘ < M cstar < 6 Mʘ (C-star phase). The ejected material that, C star, remains trapped in the central potential might also explain the systematically observed increased strength of the optical CN bands in Seyfert 2 galaxies and is consistent with the significant contribution of intermediate age stars to the optical continuum of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei...|$|E

We chose a pilot field of ~ 0. 4 deg 2 located in the South-west of the Small Magelllanic <b>Cloud</b> <b>bar,</b> where the star field is among the densest and highest reddened region in the galaxy. In order to devise an appropriate automatic procedure we made use of dimensions and stellar densities observed in the VMC data sets of the known clusters in this area. We executed different kernel density estimations over a sample of more than 358 000 stars with magnitudes measured in the three YJKs filters. We analysed the new cluster candidates whose colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), cleaned from field star contamination, were used to assess the clusters' reality and estimate reddenings and ages of the genuine systems. As a result 38 objects (??? a 55 per cent increase in the known star clusters located in the surveyed field) of 0. 15 - 0. 40 arcmin (2. 6 - 7. 0 pc) in radius resulted to have near-infrared CMD features which resemble those of star clusters of young to moderate intermediate age (log(t yr- 1) ~ 7. 5 - 9. 0).

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{numerical}} simulation of the history and future development of the Pleiades. This study builds on our previous one that established statistically the present-day structure of this system. Our simulation begins just after molecular cloud gas has been expelled by the embedded stars. We then follow, using an N body code, the stellar dynamical evolution of the cluster to the present and beyond. Our initial state is that which evolves, over the 125 Myr age of the cluster, to a configuration most closely matching the current one. We find that the original cluster, newly stripped of gas, already had a virial radius of 4 pc. This configuration was larger than most observed, embedded clusters. Over time, the cluster expanded further and the central surface density fell by about a factor of two. We attribute both effects to the liberation of energy from tightening binaries of short period. Indeed, the original binary fraction was close to unity. The ancient Pleiades also had significant mass segregation, which persists in the cluster today. In the future, the central density of the Pleiades will continue to fall. For the first few hundred Myr, the cluster as a whole will expand because of dynamical heating by binaries. The expansion process is aided by mass loss through stellar evolution, which weakens the system's gravitational binding. At later times, the Galactic tidal field begins to heavily deplete the cluster mass. It is believed that most open clusters are eventually destroyed by close passage of a giant molecular <b>cloud.</b> <b>Barring</b> that eventuality, the density falloff will continue for as long as 1 Gyr, by which time most of the cluster mass will have been tidally stripped away by the Galactic field.
