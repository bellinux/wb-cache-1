During the next four decades, Indian GDP {{is expected to grow}} at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050. The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle class. The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.|$|E

25|$|Jackson held true to his threat not to sign, and the Buccaneers {{forfeited}} {{his rights}} before the 1987 draft. Jackson was {{in spring training}} with the Royals when someone informed {{him that he had}} a chance to play football again. Inquiring who it was, Jackson found out that he was taken in the seventh round of the draft with the 183rd pick by the Los Angeles Raiders. Initially Jackson had said he would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> baseball and would not sign, but his interest was piqued. Raiders owner Al Davis was a fan of Jackson and was receptive to the idea of Jackson playing both baseball and football. Thus, a contract was negotiated where Jackson would be permitted to play the entire baseball season with the Royals and would report to the Raiders once the season was finished. In addition to this, Davis gave Jackson a salary that was in line with what a top-flight starter at halfback would make.|$|E

Anthony stated, [...] "The character was invented for an explicitly political purpose. So it's hard to get away from that nature." [...] The Russos also said that they would be [...] "bringing some new elements to the table that will give us a twist on Winter Soldier", and indicated that filming was scheduled to begin in Atlanta. They described themselves as [...] "ecstatic" [...] with a first draft of the screenplay submitted by Markus and McFeely, and also {{stated that the}} film's title would be announced [...] "in a month or so at most", and that the concept and title for the film came from Feige, who had it [...] "for a while". In September, Joe expanded by saying the film would have another [...] "big idea that alters the universe as a whole in some way" [...] similar to S.H.I.E.L.D. falling in The Winter Soldier.

[...] When asked if episodes <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> specific and different characters, actor Jorge Garcia, who portrays Hurley Reyes, replied that [...] "It's not as clear cut as it's been in the past. We don't have the moments where someone stares off into space and then we cut to something that happened in their previous life. [...] They've gone in a slightly different direction as far as how they're telling the story and they're definitely trying to show what's going on with more people in every given episode." [...] The script included scenes with all the main characters, including Desmond in the ending, because the writers felt that after a long break the audience would like to see every character again. Like the previous three season openers, the opening scene was meant to make viewers [...] "not supposed to have any sense of where and when we are". But while the other premieres had the teaser connecting into the main plot of the episode, the writers decided to put a scene that would only return in the fourteenth episode, [...] "The Variable". The time flashes were designed in a way that demonstrated both the castaways at the beach and John Locke in the jungle were [...] "skipping" [...] to the same time periods, and also to show that time travel was painful for the characters.|$|E

[...] Over his first few months some long-time readers sent in letters of complaint when they judged that Bova was not living up to Campbell's standards, particularly when sex scenes began to appear. [...] On one occasion—Jack Wodhams' story [...] "Foundling Fathers", and its accompanying illustration by Kelly Freas—it turned out that Campbell had bought the story in question. [...] As the 1970s went on, Bova continued to publish authors such as Anderson, Dickson, and Christopher Anvil, who had appeared regularly during Campbell's tenure, but he also attracted authors who {{had not been able to}} sell to Campbell, such as Gene Wolfe, Roger Zelazny, and Harlan Ellison. [...] Frederik Pohl, who later commented in his autobiography about his difficulties in selling to Campbell, appeared in the March 1972 issue with [...] "The Gold at the Starbow's End", which was nominated for both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, and that summer Joe Haldeman's [...] "Hero" [...] appeared. [...] This was the first story in Haldeman's [...] "Forever War" [...] sequence; Campbell had rejected it, listing multiple reasons including the frequent use of profanity and the implausibility of men and women serving in combat together. [...] Bova asked to see it again and ran it without asking for changes. [...] Other new writers included Spider Robinson, whose first sale was [...] "The Guy With the Eyes" [...] in the February 1973 issue; George R.R.
