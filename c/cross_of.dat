40|$|Although zygospore (mature zygote) {{formation}} in P. blakeslleeanus occurs in liquid glucoseglutamate medium, morphological observations are made more easily when cultures are grown on 1 -mm-thick agar medium. Zygophores (sexually differentiated hyphae) develop prior to physical contact in <b>crosses</b> <b>of</b> (plus) and (minus) wild types. Zygophores interlock upon contact and then undergo six successive morphological changes {{to become a}} zygospore. Mutants with abnormal carotene synthesis exhibit aberrant sexual behavior. Some zygospores do form in <b>crosses</b> <b>of</b> carA mutants and wild types. Only paired zygophores form in <b>crosses</b> <b>of</b> wild type(plus) with car- 42 (minus), a beta-carotene-accumulating mutant. Zygophores form only on (minus) in <b>crosses</b> <b>of</b> wild type(plus) with carB(minus), carR(minus), carAcarR(minus), and carBcarR(minus) mutants, and only on (plus) in <b>crosses</b> <b>of</b> car- 43 (plus) with wild type(minus), car- 42 (minus), and carA(minus) mutants. Zygophores do not form in <b>crosses</b> <b>of</b> car- 43 (plus) with carB(minus), carR(minus), carAcarR(minus), and carBcarR(minus) mutants.
