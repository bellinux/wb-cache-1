In May 1995, he and Rice visited Lloyd Webber {{at his home in}} France, where Parker tried to bring them to work on the film. Rice and Lloyd Webber had not worked together for many years, and the script for Evita required that they compose new music. In June 1995, with assistance from the United States Department of State and senator Chris Dodd, Parker arranged a private meeting with Menem in Argentina to discuss the film's production and request permission to film at the <b>Casa</b> Rosada, the executive mansion. Although he expressed his discontent with the production, Menem granted the filmmakers creative freedom to shoot in Argentina, but not in the <b>Casa</b> Rosada. He also advised Parker to be prepared to face protests against the film. Parker had the film's production designer Brian Morris take photographs of the <b>Casa</b> Rosada, so that the production could construct a replica at Shepperton Studios in England. The director visited seven other countries before deciding to film on location in Buenos Aires and Budapest.|$|E

5000|$|The {{influence}} of Giovanni della <b>Casa's</b> sonnets {{is recognized as}} an influence on all of Milton's sonnets; critics discern della <b>Casa's</b> [...] "deliberate break with the Petrarchan tradition of regularity and smoothness". Sonnet XXIII combines two traditions, with its argument developing {{in the way of}} the English sonnet (in quatrains and a couplet) while its rhyme scheme follows the Italian form. The poem drives much of its strength from the opposition of day and night, made explicit in the last line (the pairing is discussed by Leo Spitzer in comparison with a Latin poem by Iovianus Pontanus).|$|R
