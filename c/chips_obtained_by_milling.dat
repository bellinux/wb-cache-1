40|$|Purpose: Microstructure and {{magnetic}} properties analysis of barium ferrite powder <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> <b>milling</b> and heat treatment. Design/methodology/approach: The milling process {{was carried out}} in a vibratory mill, which generated vibrations of the balls and milled material inside the container during which their collisions occur. After milling process the powders were annealed in electric chamber furnace. The X-ray diffraction methods were used for qualitative phase analysis of studied powder samples. The distribution of powder particles was determined by a laser particle analyzer. The magnetic hysteresis loops of examined powder material were measured by resonance vibrating sample magnetometer (R-VSM). Findings: The milling process of iron oxide and barium carbonate mixture causes decrease of the crystallite size of involved phases. The X-ray investigations of tested mixture milled for 30 hours and annealed at 950 °C enabled the identification of hard magnetic BaFe 12 O 19 phase and also the presence of Fe 2 O 3 phase in examined material. The Fe 2 O 3 phase is a rest of BaCO 3 dissociation in the presence of Fe 2 O 3, which forms a compound of BaFe 12 O 19. The best coercive force (HC) for mixture of powders annealed at 950 °C for 10, 20 and 30 hours is 349 kA/m, 366 kA/m and 364 kA/m, respectively. The arithmetic mean of diameter of Fe 2 O 3 and BaCO 3 mixture powders after 30 hours of milling is about 6. 0 μm.

XRD analysis shows that the deposit contains an amorphous matrix having embedded nanocrystals of the FCC phase of the solid solution of Fe and W in Ni with the average crystal grain size of 8. 8 nm. The deposit has a high internal microstrain value and a high minimum density of chaotically distributed dislocations. The effect of milling and annealing of the Ni- 11. 3 Fe- 1. 4 W alloy on electrical and magnetic properties was studied. Structural changes in the alloy take place during both annealing and milling. Upon deposition, the alloy was heated to 420 ºC. Heating resulted in structural relaxation which induced a decrease in electrical resistivity {{and an increase in}} magnetic permeability of the alloy. Further heating of the alloy at temperatures higher than 4200 C led to crystallization which caused a reduction in both electrical resistivity and magnetic permeability. The milling of the alloy for up to 12 hours caused a certain degree of structural relaxation and crystallization of the alloy. The increase in crystal grain size up to 11 nm and the partial structural relaxation induced a decrease in electrical resistivity and an increase in magnetic permeability of the alloy. Heating the powders <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> <b>milling</b> at 4200 C led to complete structural relaxation, reduced electrical resistivity, and increased magnetic permeability.
