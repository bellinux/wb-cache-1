50|$|The wing {{was built}} in five {{segments}} of equal span. Two gondolas hung from the center segment, which <b>carried</b> <b>payload,</b> radio control and telemetry electronics, and other gear. The gondolas also provided the landing gear. Each gondola had dual baby-buggy wheels in front and a bicycle wheel in back for landing gear. HALSOL was propelled by eight small electric motors driving variable-pitch propellers. There were two motors on the center wing segment, two motors on each inner wing segment, and one motor on each outer wing segment. The aircraft's total weight was about 185 kilograms (410 pounds), with about a tenth of that being payload.|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the novel concept of {{ambiguous}} mono axial vehicle robot. Such robot {{is a combination of}} Segway and dicycle, which utilizes the advantages of each chassis. The advantage of dicycle is lower energy consumption during the movement and the higher safety of <b>carried</b> <b>payload.</b> The movable platform inside the ambiguous mono axial vehicle allows using the various sensors or devices. This will change the ambiguous mono axial vehicle to the Segway type robot. Both these modes are necessary to control in the stable mode {{to ensure the safety of}} the ambiguous mono axial vehicle’s movement. The main contents of the article contain description of generalized dynamic model of ambiguous mono axial vehicle and related control of ambiguous mono axial vehicle. The proposal is unique in that the same controller is used for both modes. Several simulations verify proposed control schemes and identified parameters. Moreover, the dicycle type of platform has never been used in robotics and that is another novelty...|$|E

30|$|The {{interest}} in two-wheeled machines (TWMs) is incomparably increasing, and various linear and nonlinear methods of identification are employed for developing an accurate {{model of the}} inverted pendulum and establishing a proper control strategy for the system. Lee et al. [1] concentrated on designing a one-wheel inverted pendulum system that employs air power for balancing. The pitch angle was controlled by a DC motor, while the roll angle was regulated by air pressure sent out from ducted fans controlled by linear control methods. Chinnadurai and Ranganathan [2] focused on applying the principle of IP by proposing a two-wheel self-supporting robot controlled by an internet-on-a chip (IOC) controller. The main feature associated with this system is the capability to control the robot worldwide using the IOC, {{not to mention the}} IR, attitude, and tilt sensors installed on the robot. A novel configuration of wheeled robotic machines (WRM) which is based on the principle of two-wheeled inverted pendulum (IP) with an extended intermediate body (IB) was developed by Goher and Tokhi [3]. For providing multiple lifting levels for a <b>carried</b> <b>payload,</b> the developed machine is equipped with a linear actuator. The previously mentioned WRM was later improved by Almeshal et al. [4]. Increasing the machine’s flexibility and workspace led to a novel five DOFs two-wheeled IP with an extended rod.|$|E
