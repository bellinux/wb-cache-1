Experimental results demonstrated that the as-prepared MSNs possessed a large specific surface area (about 585 m 2 /g), uniform particle size (about 30 nm), large pore volume (1. 175 cm 3 /g), and narrow pore size distribution (1. 68 nm).

The colour of wastewater from today’s new <b>cationic</b> <b>dyes</b> for polyacrylic fibres is much more difficult to treat by physical techniques such as adsorption and chemical coagulation to archive complete decolourization, because these dyes are very highly soluble in water. The aim of the present work is to study the factors affecting the rate of decolourization of a textile wastewater witch contain water-soluble green <b>cationic</b> <b>dyes</b> derivatives of compact condensed system 2 -aminopyridine.

50|$|Acridine orange is {{an organic}} compound. It {{is used as}} a nucleic acid-selective {{fluorescent}} <b>cationic</b> <b>dye</b> useful for cell cycle determination. Being cell-permeable, it interacts with DNA and RNA by intercalation or electrostatic attractions respectively. When bound to DNA, it is very similar spectrally to fluorescein, with an excitation maximum at 502 nm and an emission maximum at 525 nm (green). When it associates with RNA, the excitation maximum shifts to 460 nm (blue) and the emission maximum shifts to 650 nm (red). Acridine orange will also enter acidic compartments such as lysosomes and become protonated and sequestered. In these low pH conditions, the dye will emit orange light when excited by blue light. Thus, acridine orange can be used to identify engulfed apoptotic cells, because it will fluoresce upon engulfment. The dye is often used in epifluorescence microscopy.|$|E

Four tetramethylisothiouronium groups per molecule are shown in the picture. ICI had claimed an average of about three side chains per molecule, but analyses by Prof Scotts lab suggested between three and four. Most of them are at the 2(3) positions, as in the formula and sometimes a cartoon representation uses the methylene bridge criss crossing across the bond between these two positions to indicate that it could bind either of these two positions. A large number of isomers, differing in the positions of the cationic groups, are possible. Alcian blue 7GX carries fewer isothiouronium groups than 8GX.

Both BiOCl and Fe/BiOCl with negatively charged surfaces showed excellent adsorption efficiency toward <b>cationic</b> <b>dyes,</b> which could sharply reach 99.6 and nearly 100 % within 3  min on BiOCl and 97.0 and 98.0 % within 10  min on Fe/BiOCl for removing RhB and MB, respectively.

The adsorption process of RhB conforms to Langmuir adsorption isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic feature. The excellent adsorption capacities of as-prepared adsorbents toward <b>cationic</b> <b>dyes</b> are rationalized on the basis of electrostatic attraction as well as open porous structure and high specific surface area.

Two different flocculants were synthesized in this study: (a) hemicellulose etherified with chloroacetic acid (HcECA) and (b) hemicellulose etherified with acrylamide (HcEAM). Both hemicellulose derivatives were prepared with various etherification mole ratios. The native hemicellulose and its derivatives were characterized using gel permeation chromatography, Fourier transform infrared and proton nuclear magnetic resonance. The coagulation/flocculation performance of the hemicellulose derivatives were evaluated with <b>cationic</b> <b>dye</b> (i. e. methylene blue, MB) at different initial pH values, hemicellulose derivative dosages and initial dye concentrations. The characterization results confirmed a successful synthesis of the respective hemicellulose derivatives with the improvement on the solubility of both derivatives. The coagulation/flocculation results indicated that HcECA 15 has better ability to remove the cationic dyes compared to HcECA 10 and HcECA 5 whereas, HcEAM 1 was better than HcEAM 0. 1, HcEAM 0. 5, HcEAM 10 and HcEAM 15. Changing the initial pH of the dye solution from acidic to alkaline resulted in the increase of dye removal percentage. In addition, higher dosages of hemicellulose derivatives also increased dye removal. On the contrary, high initial dye concentrations reduced the percentage of dye removal. HcEAM showed better efficiency on the <b>cationic</b> <b>dye</b> removal than HcECA due to its ability to produce denser flocs which are usually helpful during sedimentation. As a conclusion, both hemicellulose derivatives have their own novelty to be new flocculants for successful application in <b>cationic</b> <b>dye</b> removal processes.
