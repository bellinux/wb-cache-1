5|$|Following the battalion's {{return from}} East Timor {{it was again}} {{restructured}} to resume {{its role as a}} two-company commando battalion. However, in 2001 the Australian Government directed the permanent establishment of a second TAG {{to be based on the}} east coast of Australia. The TAG is supplemented by clearance divers from the Navy Clearance Diving Branch who form the Water troop. A Company was subsequently raised as a commando company in 2002. Following the creation of SOCOMD in 2002 and the Bali bombings in October that year, further resources became available. The battalion was subsequently involved in security operations for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Queensland in 2002. Elements of the battalion were also involved in the boarding of a North Korean freighter, the MV Pong Su—which was suspected of drug smuggling—off Newcastle on 20 April 2003. In 2005, a fourth commando company was subsequently raised, with D <b>Company</b> <b>being</b> <b>formed.</b> Later, the battalion was tasked with supporting the security arrangements for the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. In 2014, elements of the regiment were deployed to Brisbane to protect the G20 Leaders Summit held in the city on 15 and 16 November.|$|E
2500|$|The 158th Brigade {{from the}} 53rd (Welsh) Division, under {{command of the}} 15th Division and the 147th RAC were due to attack early on 16 July. The attack was postponed, because minefields around Baron had not been cleared; several flail tanks and two Churchill tanks had been {{disabled}} by mine explosions. On the next night the attack was cancelled due to fog and the operation began late on 17 July. To attack Évrecy required a long advance down a forward slope to the village. The attack was poorly prepared and the infantry battalion had already been depleted by casualties, a composite <b>company</b> <b>being</b> <b>formed</b> from one officer and fifty men and a second company consisting of only a composite platoon. The infantry were too tired {{to keep up with}} the tanks, which had to move quickly when brought under 88mm fire from the village. About [...] were taken but mortar fire forced the infantry back to their start line. The 53rd (Welsh) Division captured Cahier and defeated several big counter-attacks. More attacks by XII Corps gained no ground and during the evening of 17 July, the British force on Point 113 withdrew, ending the operation.|$|E
60|$|The {{utility of}} this {{institution}} soon appeared, {{and many more}} desiring to be admitted than we thought convenient for one company, they were advised to form another, which was accordingly done; and this went on, one new <b>company</b> <b>being</b> <b>formed</b> after another, till they became so numerous as to include most of the inhabitants who were men of property; and now, {{at the time of}} my writing this, tho' upward of fifty years since its establishment, that which I first formed, called the Union Fire Company, still subsists and flourishes, tho' the first members are all deceas'd but myself and one, who is older by a year than I am. The small fines that have been paid by members for absence at the monthly meetings have been apply'd to the purchase of fire-engines, ladders, fire-hooks, and other useful implements for each company, so that I question whether there is a city in the world better provided with the means of putting a stop to beginning conflagrations; and, in fact, since these institutions, the city has never lost by fire {{more than one or two}} houses at a time, and the flames have often been extinguished before the house in which they began has been half consumed.|$|E
5000|$|The “Red Strings” {{were also}} {{interested}} in forming blacks into soldiers and having them fight for the Union as well.

50|$|The UG form {{has been}} met with great interest, {{especially}} by start-up companies and other entrepreneurs. As of January 1, 2012, {{there had been}} 64,371 of such companies formed. Since then, traditional corporations have been reduced in importance, having largely been supplanted by the UG (and also the GmbH) among new <b>companies</b> <b>being</b> <b>formed.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1927 Grimsby Corporation Transport bought {{its first}} motor buses, these being centre {{entrance}} single deck Albions.

50|$|In 1930, {{negotiations}} between Keighley Corporation and West Yorkshire {{led to a}} joint <b>company</b> <b>being</b> <b>formed</b> called Keighley-West Yorkshire Services.

50|$|Further {{reinforcements}} for {{the battalion}} disembarked soon after Diadem arrived on 29 November at Santander, resulting in two <b>companies</b> <b>being</b> added and another <b>company</b> of artillery <b>being</b> <b>formed.</b> Some of the reinforcements {{had returned from}} garrison duty {{on the island of}} Anholt, Denmark.|$|R
50|$|The 2002 Budget cut the {{starting}} rate to zero, with marginal relief applying {{in the same}} way. This caused {{a significant increase in}} the number of <b>companies</b> <b>being</b> incorporated, as businesses that had operated as self-employed, paying income tax on profits from just over £5,000, were attracted to the corporation tax rate of 0% on income up to £10,000. Previously self-employed individuals could now distribute profits as dividend payments rather than salaries. For companies with profits under £50,000 the corporation tax rate varied between 0% and 19%. Because dividend payments come with a basic rate tax credit, provided the recipient did not earn more than the basic rate allowance, no further tax would be paid. The number of new <b>companies</b> <b>being</b> <b>formed</b> in 2002-2003 reached 325,900, an increase of 45% on 2001-2002.|$|R
5000|$|AVA's other {{directors}} were Edward Fokczyński, Antoni Palluth, and Leonard Danilewicz's elder brother, Ludomir Danilewicz.

50|$|MCI and {{the other}} inter-exchange {{carriers}} (IXC) were all severely impacted by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The original intent of the Act was to provide more competition but the bill actually did the reverse. The implementation of the Act led to a complete reversal {{of the growth of}} the telecommunications sector. Where the divestiture of AT&T (Ma Bell) in 1984 led to dozens of long distance <b>companies</b> <b>being</b> <b>formed,</b> the Telecommunications Act of 1996 provided for the consolidation where in 2006 only Cingular, Sprint & Verizon exist. Within two years of the ACT, MCI was part of a consolidation effort that started with Worldcom purchasing them and ultimately led to bankruptcy and loss of retirements for their loyal employees and finally absorption into Verizon.|$|R

2500|$|Although several Volunteer Companies {{were already}} in {{existence}} at various locations around the state, the Governor's call sparked a wave of formations. State newspapers {{in the summer and}} fall of 1860 have several stories of volunteer <b>companies</b> <b>being</b> <b>formed,</b> drilling, and participating in the regular muster of the militia regiments. The leaders of these volunteer companies began to search for uniforms and equipment, often requesting them through militia channels to the Governor, but then turning to private sources when the State Government was unable to help. The state legislature responded to the need for arms and equipment in January 1861 by appropriating $100,000 for the arming and equipping of the militia <b>being</b> <b>formed</b> into volunteer <b>companies.</b> Act Number 192, which was approved on January 21, 1861, appropriated money [...] "for the purpose of arming the volunteer militia of this state, when formed into volunteer military companies..." ...|$|R

50|$|Following that, Cotogni {{was engaged}} for Foscari and La traviata at Asti and then Cuneo, the Teatro Rossini again, Zara, in Genova, and at Turin {{for the opening}} of the new Teatro Alfieri.

50|$|The castle {{itself was}} {{auctioned}} in November 1934 and sold.

60|$|Then a light {{broke in}} upon Singleton. He had not placed his host {{in the same}} {{category}} with Mrs. Lansing and Sylvia. It {{looked as if he had}} changed his plans and wished to prevent the <b>company</b> from <b>being</b> <b>formed.</b> This caused Singleton to consider how far he would be justified in assisting him. He could honestly go some length in doing so, and, having fallen a victim to Sylvia's charm, he was willing to do his utmost.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to a taxi <b>company</b> <b>being</b> <b>formed</b> in Queensland, {{owners of}} taxis simply had {{signs on the}} {{vehicles}} indicating [...] "For Hire" [...] painted on the side, front and rear. Before 1924, all taxis plied for hire without a means of recording the mileage, other than the driver himself calculating the fare according to how far he drove his passengers. There was a fare scale, however, the driver could charge whatever he thought was nearest to the amount specified. This no doubt, brought about the introduction of meters.|$|E
50|$|In 1637, he was {{appointed}} astronomer of a <b>company</b> <b>being</b> <b>formed</b> to sail to the Dutch Brazil. He was accompanied by Willem Piso, a physician. He afterward entered the service of Dutch Brazil's governor, Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen, whose patronage provided him with the means of exploring a considerable part of Brazil. He arrived in Brazil in early 1638 and undertook the first zoological, botanical, and astronomical expedition there, exploring {{various parts of the}} colony to study its natural history and geography. Traveling later to the coast of Guinea, he fell a victim to the climate.|$|E

60|$|In many of {{the camps}} life had now become more civilised. In cases where the bed of gold-bearing gravel was large, and where, consequently, work would be {{continued}} for a long time, wooden towns had sprung up, with hotels, stores, drinking and gambling saloons. Work was here carried on methodically; water was, in some cases, brought many miles in little canals from mountain lakes down to the diggings, and operations were carried on on a large scale. <b>Companies</b> were <b>being</b> <b>formed</b> for buying up and working numbers of claims together.|$|R
60|$|The lounger {{returned}} in hot haste with {{information that the}} people there were in the highest state of excitement regarding the new <b>company</b> which was <b>being</b> <b>formed</b> {{by some of the}} most influential men in the county, and related with many embellishments of his own, the story of how the vein had been discovered by Sam and Fred.|$|R
5|$|Initially, the {{battalion}} was stretched across several locations, with <b>companies</b> <b>being</b> <b>formed</b> in Seymour, Victoria, Brighton, Tasmania, and Northam, Western Australia. The Tasmanians and Western Australians had initially been intended {{to join the}} 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion, and during its formative period, the companies completed basic training in their home locations, before concentrating together at Warradale, South Australia with the Tasmanians sailing to Melbourne to link up with Victorians prior to entraining for the journey west, while the Western Australians crossed the Nullarbor Plain. At this point, the unit's establishment was completed, as {{the battalion}} structure was finalised. It was structured {{along the same lines}} as the other 2nd AIF machine gun battalions, which consisted of between 800 and 900 personnel organised into a headquarters element consisting of three platoons– signals, anti-aircraft and administration– and four machine gun companies, each equipped with 12 Vickers machine guns, to make a total of 48 across the entire battalion. Within the machine gun companies there were three platoons; these were numbered sequentially starting from 1 to 3 in Headquarters Company through to 13 to 15 in 'D' Company. A Light Aid Detachment of electrical and mechanical engineers was also attached.|$|R
50|$|Upon the {{reconstitution}} of the Territorial Army in 1947, {{the regiment}} {{was reduced to}} a squadron (C (Lovat Scouts) Squadron) of The Scottish Horse, part of the Royal Armoured Corps. It was converted to artillery in 1949, becoming the 677th Mountain Artillery, RA (Lovat Scouts). It remained in the Royal Artillery, under numerous different titles it, until, with further defence cuts in the 1960s, was disbanded with two squadrons, one becoming a battery of The Highland Regiment, RA and the other joining the 3rd (Territorial) Battalion, Queen's Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons). The Lovat Scouts were reorganised with No. 1 (Lovat Scouts) <b>Company</b> <b>being</b> <b>formed</b> as part of the 51st Highland Volunteers.|$|E
50|$|Coal {{was found}} at Benwerrin in 1895, when mining began there on a small scale. The Great Western Coal <b>Company</b> <b>being</b> <b>formed</b> to mine it in 1897, and it {{initially}} carried the coal to Deans Marsh railway station by wagon. A second company was formed to build a tramway to the Forrest railway line in September 1898, but it went into liquidation by March 1899. The Great Western Colliery Company, which {{had taken over the}} mine, completed the tramway and it opened in 1893. The mine and tramway went into liquidation in December 1903; the tramway locomotive was sold in 1904 and the tramway lifted in 1905. The mine reopened in 1942 before closing for good in 1949, and little trace remains of the former tramway reservation.|$|E
50|$|Karrimor {{was founded}} and based in Lancashire, England, {{following}} World War II, {{with the company}} moving early on from Rawtenstall shop premises to nearby Clayton-le-Moors. Its history began in 1943, when Waterfoot bicycle shop owner Charles Parsons (1910-?) went blind from an accident that had occurred in 1939. Under war and post-war conditions, he was also unable to obtain saddlebag and pannier stock for sale, but {{was still able to}} buy local raw fabric. His wife and her sister (Mary Parsons 1914-? and Grace Davies) began to make bicycle bags for his shop, which the family also began to sell locally to other shops. This led to the Karrimor Bag <b>Company</b> <b>being</b> <b>formed</b> in 1946. As a saddlebag manufacturer it competed with companies then in the same industry, such as Carradice and Dunlop.|$|E
5000|$|After the Conquest, unlike earlier British {{immigrants}} {{who came to}} North America to escape religious or political persecution, those who came to Montreal tended to be from well-connected mercantile families and were there to further their fortunes, both for themselves and the Empire. In 1795, Isaac Weld observed {{that most of these}} British merchants were [...] "well acquainted with the French language", but that the French [...] "had an unconquerable aversion to learn English", showing signs that rather than integrating, the French Canadians were retreating further into their own culture. By 1829, La Minerve lamented that [...] "Canadiens formerly engaged in business have gradually retired". The traditional Catholic education focused entirely on classics, whereas the more modern British education system also prepared its young men for business. Though not excluded from commerce as is often thought, the educated Canadiens were inclined and encouraged to pursue gentlemen's professions of the Ancien Régime; remaining on their Seigneuries or entering law, politics and the Church. Many made money from investing in the <b>companies</b> <b>being</b> <b>formed</b> around them, but apart from a handful of men such as Masson, Quesnel and Forget, the French Canadians left 'trade' to Les Anglais: Napoleon's [...] "nation of shopkeepers".|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century Valencia was an industrialised city. The silk {{industry}} had disappeared, {{but there was}} a large production of hides and skins, wood, metals and foodstuffs, this last with substantial exports, particularly of wine and citrus. Small businesses predominated, but with the rapid mechanisation of industry larger <b>companies</b> were <b>being</b> <b>formed.</b> The best expression of this dynamic was in the regional exhibitions, including that of 1909 held next to the pedestrian avenue L'Albereda (Paseo de la Alameda), which depicted the progress of agriculture and industry. Among the most architecturally successful buildings of the era were those designed in the Art Nouveau style, such as the North Station (Estació del Nord) and the Central and Columbus markets.|$|R
50|$|As {{the wartime}} buildup {{began in earnest}} in 1942, the {{battalion}} underwent considerable turbulence. In February 1942 Company C was detached, redesignated as the 10th Light Tank Company and sent for garrison duty in Iceland, with a new <b>Company</b> C <b>being</b> <b>formed</b> in May. In August, six officers and 135 men were reassigned to form the cadre of the 746th Tank Battalion. And finally as preparations for combat became earnest, Company A was detached on 17 September and sent to Camp Dix, New Jersey. On 26 September, the company sailed from New York. With stops at Belfast, Northern Ireland, Greenock, Scotland, and Inverary, Scotland, the company was preparing to land with the 39th Regimental Combat Team, 9th Infantry Division at Algiers as part of Operation Torch.|$|R
