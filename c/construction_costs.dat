40|$|A new {{approach}} to the forecasting of <b>construction</b> <b>cost</b> indices in Taiwan is presented. <b>Construction</b> <b>cost</b> indices have always been {{used to assess the}} variations in construction labour and material costs. These indices have been traditionally based on historical statistical information in Taiwan. However, the indices fall short in forecasting the future cost trends in the construction industry. By investigating the characteristic data that make up the <b>construction</b> <b>cost</b> indices, the major determining factors were identified as (1) 'the number of difference', (2) the required periods of preceding <b>construction</b> <b>cost</b> indices, (3) the weight associated with each preceding <b>construction</b> <b>cost</b> index, (4) the mean value of the series of <b>construction</b> <b>cost</b> indices that have been converted into a stationary series, and (5) the estimation of the errors between the predicted values of <b>construction</b> <b>cost</b> indices and the observed values of <b>construction</b> <b>cost</b> indices. An analytical model has been established to forecast the present and future <b>construction</b> <b>cost</b> indices based on these factors, and its feasibility tested by using the observed data of the <b>construction</b> <b>cost</b> indices obtained from the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China. The results suggest that this model is reasonably adequate in forecasting the trend values of <b>construction</b> <b>cost</b> indices in Taiwan. <b>Construction</b> <b>Cost</b> Indices, Determining Factors, Forecasting, Modelling, Taiwan, Experience,...|$|R

Prince George's County officials threatened to block all further Metrorail construction unless they received guarantees that the stations in their county would be built. Funding for the remaining seven Green Line stations in the District and Prince George's remained in doubt as of August 1991, with District officials saying that it made sense to build the Georgia Avenue – Petworth and Columbia Heights stations and Prince George's representatives demanding that the three stations in their county be completed. WMATA said that it had so little money it could not fund 16 critical small construction projects, among them security gates at the Navy Yard and Waterfront stations and parts for escalators at the seven new Green Line stations in D.C. and Prince George's County. The funding impasse was broken in November 1991 when local and state governments agreed to roughly triple their contribution to Metro's <b>construction</b> <b>costs</b> by 1994 to complete the entire system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) {{technology}} has been introduced to Malaysia since the 1990 ’s. Since then, several trials had lain projects had been initiated {{for the purpose of}} evaluating the mix on local road condition. However, the acceptability of SMA is still quite discouraging among the local road authorities. This setback is probably due to the misconception on the high initial cost of SMA. But recently, this claim has been challenged. A Malaysian study revealed that the <b>construction</b> <b>cost</b> of SMA is 10 % to 15 % less than the conventional mix. Hence, this study aims to compare the <b>construction</b> <b>cost</b> of SMA and ACW 20.
