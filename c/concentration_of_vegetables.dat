Regression models based on neural networks were developed in order to calculate the level of sucrose, glucose, and nitrogen concentration, which {{can be related to}} sweetness and amino acid <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetables.</b> We demonstrate the method using hyperspectral data of wavelengths ranging from the visible to the near infrared acquired from an experimental field of green vegetal soybeans. A performance analysis is reported comparing regression models built using datasets pre-processed using the first and second derivative analysis. The second derivative transformed dataset presented the best performance overall. Glucose could be pre-dicted with greater accuracy. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{concerns}} of healthy life and healthy environments have been increasing {{all over the}} world. People are looking for vegetables containing low nitrate. The hydroponic culture is a good system to produce the concentration of nitrate of vegetables under control. However, an efficient use of water in hydroponic system is also very concerned. The aims of this thesis were to develop a hydroponic system that supplies the daily required nutrient with the daily required water for evapotranspiration and to know the best nutrient supplying time for lowering the nitrate <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>vegetables</b> without the loss of vegetable production. The seedling of Pak-chio (Brassica Chinensis L.) was growing in a normal nutrient solution for three weeks then growing in different treatments for one week. There were 7 treatments (Ck, D 1, D 2, D 3, DN 1, DN 2, and DN 3) designed {{in this study and}} conducted twice, one in 2006 and other one in 2007, with 4 replications for each time. Plants were growing in a container with 24000 ml nutrient solution for CK treatment. The nutrient used for treatments of D 1, D 2, and D 3 was prepared in the estimated consuming water and supplied only once in each morning. The consuming waster was divided into two parts one supplied in the morning and the other in the evening, with 30 % and 70 % for each, respectively. The nutrient used for DN 1 was supplied in the morning water, for DN 2 was evenly divided in the morning and in the evening water, and for DN 3 was supplied in the evening water. The elemental concentration of plant shoot was digested with HCl and HNO 3 solution then determined by ICP-AES. The concentration of anions was extracted with hot water and determined by IC instrument. The DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferrous ion chelating power as the indicator for antioxidant were also determined. The water consumption of the system developed in this study was less than 25 % of the original system, and the production of Pak-chio was higher than those of control, even reached significant level in the experiment conducted in 2006 under fully sunshine days. The sunshine length in 2007 was low due to long rainy days, which causes the production among treatments did not reach significant level. The nitrate concentration of shoot was lowest for D 1 and DN 1 treatments, and significantly lower than those of CK and DN 3 in 2006. The nitrate concentration of shoot of those in 2007, under low sunshine days, were 2 to 4 times of those in 2006, under fully sunshine days. Results showed that the DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferrous ion chelating power of the first culture and ferrous ion chelating power of the second culture are positively related to the dry weight of the Pak-chio. In addition, the DPPH radical scavenging activity in the second culture is negatively related to the ferrous ion chelating power. This may indicate that the ability of antioxidant was affected by the dry matter content, the dry matter content of the first crop was higher than those of the second crop, and other plant qualities may be also envolved. The results supported that the daily required nutrient supplied daily in the morning with low ratio of water, and remaining the high ratio of water supplied in the evening will make the Pak-choi in high production with low nitrate concentration in eatable part. 隨著健康概念之發達，消費者希望蔬菜硝酸態氮要能低。水耕控制可以控制蔬菜硝酸碳氮濃度，其操作要如何節水也是當今普遍受重視的重要課題。本論文之目的在以水耕研究養液濃度及每日生長所需養分量於早晨或傍晚添加在每天蒸發散量水對小白菜生長、硝酸鹽含量及抗氧化能力之影響。 於 2006 及 2007 年網室中各種一期作小白菜，幼苗先於水耕液培養三星期後進行試驗處理一星期。對照組(CK) 以標準養液培養，置於 24000 ml養液栽培；試驗組分為以濃度做處理的日間供水組(D 1 、D 2 、D 3) ，分別由低至高，以不同倍數濃度之標準養液培養，於每日清晨隨小白菜當日所需水量一次加入；及以養分供應時間做處理的日夜供水組(DN 1 、DN 2 、DN 3) ，分別為日間供給養分、日夜各供給一半養分、夜間供給養分。日夜供水組每日所需水量 30 %於清晨供應、 70 %於傍晚供應，而其養分則依不同組別，隨各組日夜供應之水分加入。試驗組水用量在第一及第二期作分別為 5082 ml及 6024 ml。植體採樣秤鮮及 70 ℃下烘乾重，經消解後以ICP測磷含量及陽離子濃度；熱水抽出液以IC測陰離子濃度。並測定DPPH清除能力(DPPH radical scavenging activity) 及亞鐵離子螯合能力(ferrous ion chelating power) 作為總抗氧化能力指標。 試驗結果顯示水耕小白菜在以蒸發散量水分量及養分需要量下，可節水 75 %以上，且小白菜產量提高，尤其充分光照(2006 年) 下提高之產量達顯著水準。在低光照(2007 年) 下則養分濃度對小白菜產量影響不顯著，且反而以最低養分量處理乾物產量最高。光照充足時白天添加養分夜間添加水DN 1 處理和最低養分量D 1 處理植體硝酸態氮濃度最低且達顯著水準，對照組CK及夜間添加養分DN 3 處理硝酸態氮濃度最高。低光照下植體硝酸態氮濃度提高， 2007 年處理硝酸態氮濃度為 2006 年之 2 到 4 倍。小白菜植體第一作之DPPH清除能力、亞鐵螯合能力及第二作之DPPH清除能力皆與小白菜乾物重呈正相關。第二作中DPPH清除能力與亞鐵螯合能力呈負相關的現象，更是暗示了抗氧化物對於光合產物之需求。因此，如何提升小白菜乾物產量及如何保留小白菜之光合產物，將是提升抗氧化能力之重要目標。摘要	I 英文摘要	III 目錄	V 圖序	VII 表序	IX 附錄序	XI 壹、前言	 1 貳、前人研究	 4 一、小白菜生長期間養分及水分的吸收	 4 二、小白菜養液配方	 6 三、自由基	 7 四、自由基對人體造成的影響	 8 五、自由基產生的化學反應	 10 六、一氧化氮(nitric oxide，NO) 	 10 七、DPPH自由基(2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) 	 12 八、金屬與氧化壓力	 12 九、機能性食品(functional foods) 	 17 十、小分子抗氧化物	 18 十一、氮的同化(麩胺酸合成酶循環，glutamate synthase cycle) 21 参、材料與方法	 23 一、水耕試驗	 23 二、分析方法	 32 肆、結果與討論	 35 一、第一作小白菜	 35 二、第二作小白菜	 58 伍、結論	 85 陸、未來研究	 87 柒、參考文獻	 89 捌、附錄	 9...|$|E

Several agricultural residues/products including sugarcane bagasse, wheat bran, corn meal, barely bran and equal mixtures of sugarcane bagasse with agricultural residues were applied as solid substrate. Lipase produced from the pure sugarcane bagasse showed higher activities than other substrates; which resulted enzyme activities of 155. 76 and 138. 37 U/gds for the top and middle trays respectively. Furthermore, the influence of carbon and nitrogen supplements was investigated.

40|$|Samples of {{rice and}} some {{vegetables}} (Amaranth leaves, arum stem, green banana, amaranth stick, brinjal, potato) were collected from Uttamdi and Naojam villages of Matlab area of Chandpur district, Bangladesh and were analyzed for arsenic (As) content by Hydride Generation Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (HG-AAS). Both raw and cooked samples of the food items were studied. The As concentration in raw rice was 239. 1 ± 13. 68 µg/Kg, whereas the value was 56. 34 ± 22. 95 µg/Kg in cooked rice. The reduction in As content was 76. 4 %, presumably the loss of As was due to discarding of the bran after cooking the rice. In contrast, the mean As concentrations in raw and cooked amaranth were 22. 8 ± 3. 76 and 145. 6 ± 141. 39 µg/Kg, in raw and cooked arum were 7. 03 ± 0. 07 and 110. 33 ± 100. 4 µg/Kg respectively. There were thus remarkable increases <b>of</b> As <b>concentrations</b> in cooked vegetables compared to raw. The higher <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> cooked <b>vegetables</b> was presumably due to cooking with As contaminated tube-well water containing a high <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> As.

40|$|Being {{at the top}} of {{the food}} chain, man is the main {{receiver}} of unwanted metals through vegetable consumption. The situation is exacerbated in developing countries due to the lack of regulations where people consume vegetables grown using polluted soil and water. Most of the research works conducted in Addis Ababa revealed that the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> metals in <b>vegetables</b> reached toxic level and it was attributed, exclusively, to the industrial sources. To investigate the impact of natural environmental changes, in the current work, vegetable, water and soil samples were collected from the northern part of the city of Addis Ababa where there is no industrial activities and Ziway area in the Main Ethiopian Rift. Ziway area was selected as a control point due to its location, which is away from the industrial activities. Populated area and rural area were compared to investigate for the <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> metals such as Cd, Cr, Pb and Zn, in soils, vegetables and irrigation water in order to understand the magnitude of metals in the edible part <b>of</b> the <b>vegetables.</b> The results indicate that vegetables that are grown in industrially free area of northern part of Addis Ababa, which are destined to the domestic consumption, contain high level of metals that are generated from geogenic sources. Until recent days, industrial pollution was attributed to be the main source of metals in the city’s irrigation water and irrigated vegetables, however, natural sources are widespread in the city. It is presumed that long time consumption <b>of</b> <b>vegetables</b> loaded with metals could pose health risk...|$|R

40|$|The {{exposure}} to dioxins (including polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls) occurs predominantly via the intake of food. The main {{contribution to the}} total intake originates from the consumption of animal fat. Nevertheless, vegetables were estimated to contribute 13 % to the total dietary intake, although the uncertainty in this figure was considered large (Freijer et al., 2001). In the present study, a detailed investigation into the <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> dioxins in <b>vegetables</b> and subsequently the intake via the consumption <b>of</b> <b>vegetables</b> is calculated. To that aim, eighteen different vegetables were bought in eight Dutch retail shops in two different seasons. The samples were pooled per season and analysed for dioxins. The summer vegetables could be measured very sensitively: the maximum levels (assuming that samples below the limit of detection -LOD- equal a concentration equal to the LOD) vary between 3 and 10 pg toxic equivalents (TEQ) per kg fresh weight (FW). The winter vegetables could be measured less sensitively; the LOD for each congener was approximately 10 pg TEQ/kg FW. The maximum levels (with the exception of curly kale) vary between 30 and 70 pg TEQ/kg FW. The average level in curly kale is estimated as 100 - 200 pg TEQ/ kg FW. Using the maximum levels, the average intake of dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs by the consumption <b>of</b> <b>vegetables</b> is estimated as 0. 12 pg TEQ/kg bodyweight/day. When a consistency of patterns between detected and non-detected levels is assumed, the most likely estimate is 0. 014 pg TEQ/ kg bodyweight/day.

It is actually an organic waste {{that can be used}} to make biogas. The reactions of biogas reforming are included by three steps, hydrolysis reaction, acidic reaction and methanogenic reaction. At this research we use cow manure as a mixing and as starter for methanobacteria. The intention of this research are to make biogas using vegetable waste from traditional market in batch system, to know the <b>concentration</b> and composition <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> waste, water and cow manure in slurry, and also to know the heating value and volume of biogas. Tools that used are plastic tank and simple type of floating drum biodigester with manometer that is operated in room temperature, atmospheric pressure. The dependence variables are <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> slurry within 6 - 10 % (dry basic weight per volume slurry) and composition 1 : 0, 1 : 0, 5 and 1 : 1 weight comparison <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> waste with cow manure. The data of biogas volume and heating value will be observed everyday until the production of biogas stops. Biogas is produced since the first day of digestion until 35 days. The accumulation of biogas volume is reached the highest amount in 9 % <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> and 1 : 0, 5 of composition.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to investigate heavy metal accumulation in 22 vegetable species and to assess the human health risks <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption. Six vegetable types were cultivated on farmland contaminated with heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, and As). The target hazard quotient (THQ) method was used to assess the human health risks posed by heavy metals through vegetable consumption. Clear differences were found in the <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> heavy metals in edible parts <b>of</b> the different <b>vegetables.</b> The <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> heavy metals decreased in the sequence as leafy vegetables > stalk vegetables/root vegetables/solanaceous vegetables > legume vegetables/melon <b>vegetables.</b> The ability <b>of</b> leafy <b>vegetables</b> to uptake and accumulate heavy metals was the highest, and that <b>of</b> melon <b>vegetables</b> was the lowest. This indicated that the low accumulators (melon vegetables) were suitable for being planted on contaminated soil, while the high accumulators (leafy vegetables) were unsuitable. In Shizhuyuan area, China, the total THQ values of adults and children through consumption <b>of</b> <b>vegetables</b> were 4. 12 and 5. 41, respectively, suggesting that the residents may be facing health risks due to vegetable consumption, and that children were vulnerable to the adverse effects of heavy metal ingestion...|$|R
40|$|Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biopolymers, {{which can}} replace {{petrochemical}} plastics in many applications. However, these bioplastics are currently far {{more expensive than}} petrochemical plastics. Many researchers are investigating the use of inexpensive substrates derived from waste streams. Waste frying oil is abundant {{and can be used}} in PHA production without filtration. Cupriavidus necator (formerly known as Ralstonia eutropha) is a versatile organism for the production of PHAs. Small-scale batch fermentation studies have been set up, using different <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> pure <b>vegetable</b> oil, heated vegetable oil and waste frying oil. These oils are all rapeseed oils. It has been shown that Cupriavidus necator produced the homopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) from the rapeseed oils. The achieved PHB concentration from waste frying oil was 1. 2 g/l, which is similar to a concentration that can be obtained from glucose. The PHB harvest from pure oil and heated oil was 0. 62 g/l and 0. 9 g/l respectively. A feed of waste frying oil could thus achieve more biopolymer than pure vegetable oil. While the use of a waste product is beneficial from a life-cycle perspective, PHB is not the only product that can be made from waste oil. The collection of waste frying oil is becoming more widespread, making waste oil a good alternative to purified oil or glucose for PHB production...|$|R

Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are used as an energy and carbon storage compound within certain bacterial cells. The industry is looking into replacing the plastics, which are not biodegradable, with PHAs because they are biodegradable polymers despite the current plastics. These are biopolymers, which can replace petrochemical plastics in many applications. However, these bioplastics are more expensive right now than petrochemical plastics for example one of the cheap sources for producing PHA without filtration is waste frying oil.
