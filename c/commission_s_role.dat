40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{encourage}} legislators, practitioners, academics, and others concerned with this issue to reflect on this fundamental question before making a commitment to any specific set of standards: What general conception of the mediation process and the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> should govern that set of standards? Specifically, I challenge the reader to resist adopting what seem to be the two currently prevailing conceptions of the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role.</b> I argue instead for a conception based on traditional mediation theory and practice, and implied in recent state legislation. Part II of this article identifies two current conceptions of the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role.</b> While both are popular among their respective constituencies, both are fundamentally flawed. According to the first, the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> is to facilitate agreements in as many cases as possible, thus obviating the need for trial in court. According to the second, the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> is to ensure that neither party 2 ̆ 7 s rights are compromised in the settlement process. The first I refer to as the efficiency conception, and the second as the protection-of-rights conception. This article explains why neither conception is coherent, and why neither is a sound basis for mediator standards. In Part III, I argue in favor of a third, sounder conception of the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> - the empowerment-and-recognition conception. According to this conception, the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> is neither to promote agreement nor to protect rights per se. Instead, the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> is to encourage the parties 2 ̆ 7 exercise of their autonomy and independent choice in deciding whether and how to resolve their dispute, and to promote their mutual recognition of each other as fellow human beings despite their conflict. Part IV explores how this third conception would guide us in choosing, and rejecting, specific mediator standards. The concrete focus of this article, particularly the final section, is on the impact of the conception of the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> on standards of ethical mediation practice. Moreover, this article focuses on the mediator 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> and responsibilities as mediator, regardless of whether the mediator is a professional who occupies other roles as well. For, whatever other professional ties bind them, mediators occupy a unique role which they are ethically obligated to understand and fulfill.

Data was collected electronically using the survey method in one urban Florida school district. Qualitative and quantitative data were captured using the Principal 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Role</b> Questionnaire (PRQ) (Goodwin, 2002). Thirty-six principal role descriptor statements on the PRQ survey requested a level of agreement from research participants regarding changes, current and future roles of the secondary principal. Four open ended comment requests allowed participants to comment on the principal 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> in those areas. Role descriptor statements were categorized into four areas: strategic leadership, instructional leadership, organizational leadership and political and community leadership. Quantitative findings revealed that teacher perceptions regarding the secondary middle school principal 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> were significantly significant for only 14 of the 36 role descriptors when compared to principals 2 ̆ 7 scores. Teachers 2 ̆ 7 mean score ratings were lower than principals 2 ̆ 7 for all 36 PRQ items, however their scores were considered in agreement, as no score was lower than 2. 52.

40|$|Background and Purpose - The {{dynamics}} of the patient-practitioner relationship is recognized to influence patient adherence to medical recommendations.

Patients and physical therapists agree patient participation is essential, but {{do they have the}} same perceptions regarding what the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> entails? The {{purpose of this study was}} to uncover and compare patient and physical therapist perceptions regarding the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> in outpatient physical therapy. · We hypothesized that therapist and patient perceptions would not be consistent with·one another, and indicate therapists believed the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> to encompass a higher level of participation. Subjects and Methods - 94 current physical therapy patients and 37 practicing physical therapists from local outpatient clinics participated in this study. Each completed a questionnaire to obtain information regarding demographics, patient education, and responses to ten statements aimed at exploring the beliefs regarding· the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>role</b> in physical therapy. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and unpaired t-tests. Results - Analysis indicated little significant difference between patient and therapist perceptions, yet a large degree of variance within patient responses.

The large degree of variance observed suggests patients are not as clear as physical therapists on the degree of participation their role entails.

The {{purpose of the study was}} to collect research data to determine Utah high school student attitudes toward women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>roles</b> and non-traditional vocational career choices. The survey instrument used to collect the data was constructed, pilot tested, factor analyzed, and revised prior to its administration to the sample. The revised instrument contained 60 attitudinal statements regarding women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>roles</b> and non-traditional vocational career chokes and demographic data requests. Instrument reliability was determined on each of the factors using the Guttman Split-half. The Factor I coefficient of reliability was. 91. The reliability coefficient on Factor II was. 82, while the Factor III reliability coefficient was. 81. A total of 23 Utah public high schools and 1, 454 sophomore students participated in the study. The data were analyzed using Five-way Analysis of Variance and Chi Square programs (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). The Total Attitudinal Score, based on Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Roles</b> and Non-Traditional Vocational Career Choices, and three factor scores were the dependent variables analyzed. The factor scores included: Factor I, Women 2 ̆ 7 s Place [...] Women 2 ̆ 7 s Roles; Factor II, Sex Role Equity [...] Equal Treatment; and Factor III, Leadership Roles. Comparisons were made on total score and three factor scores based on the five independent variables: Sex (male/female), Religious Commitment (high/low), Location of Family Residence (rural/metro), Mother 2 ̆ 7 s Employment Status (employed/not employed), and Social Class (middle/working). A significant difference was found between male and female student attitudes for each factor and the total score. On each comparison of the Sex variable, female attitudes toward women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>roles</b> and choices were more non-traditional than male attitudes. For comparisons on the Religious Commitment variable, a significant difference was found in attitudes between students of high and low religious commitment on total score and each of the factor scores. Students of low religious commitment held more non-traditional attitudes toward women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>roles</b> and choices than students of high religious commitment. A significant difference was found on the Location of Family Residence variable for Total Attitudinal Score. Students from metropolitan locations responded more non-traditionally toward women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>roles</b> and non-traditional vocational career choices than students from rural locations. Differences in rural and metropolitan student attitudes were not found to be significant for Factor I, Factor II, and Factor III scores. Significant differences in student attitudes were found on the Mother 2 ̆ 7 s Employment Status variable on total score and each of the factor scores. Students whose mothers were employed outside the home held more non-traditional attitudes toward women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>roles</b> and related career choices than students with homemaker mothers. Findings on the Social Class variable were found to be significant for the Total Attitudinal Score and Factor scores II and III. A significant difference was found in attitudes between students from middle class families and students from working class families. Students from middle class families held more non-traditional attitudes toward roles and related career choices for women than students from working class families. No significant difference was found on the Social Class variable for Factor I...|$|R
