60|$|In narrating {{the story}} of Columbus, {{it has been the}} {{endeavor}} of the author to place him in a clear and familiar point of view; for this purpose he has rejected no circumstance, however trivial, which appeared to evolve some point of character; and he has sought all kinds of <b>collateral</b> <b>facts</b> which might throw light upon his views and motives. With this view also he has detailed many facts hitherto passed over in silence, or vaguely noticed by historians, probably because they might be deemed instances of error or misconduct on the part of Columbus; but he who paints a great man merely in great and heroic traits, though he may produce a fine picture, will never present a faithful portrait. Great men are compounds of great and little qualities. Indeed, much of their greatness arises from their mastery over the imperfections of their nature, and, their noblest actions are sometimes struck forth by the collision of their merits and their defects.|$|R

60|$|When I {{was about}} of late to revise my biographical sketch, preparatory to republication, a volume {{was put into}} my hands, {{recently}} given to the public by Mr. John Forster, of the Inner Temple, who, likewise availing himself of the labors of the indefatigable Prior, and of a few new lights since evolved, has produced a biography of the poet, executed with a spirit, a feeling, a grace and an eloquence, that leave nothing to be desired. Indeed {{it would have been}} presumption in me to undertake the subject after it had been thus felicitously treated, did I not stand committed by my previous sketch. That sketch now appeared too meager and insufficient to satisfy public demand; yet it had to take its place in the revised series of my works unless something more satisfactory could be substituted. Under these circumstances I have again taken up the subject, and gone into it with more fullness than formerly, omitting none of the facts which I considered illustrative of the life and character of the poet, and giving them in as graphic a style as I could command. Still the hurried manner in which I have had to do this amid the pressure of other claims on my attention, and with the press dogging at my heels, has prevented me from giving some parts of the subject the thorough handling I could have wished. Those {{who would like to see}} it treated still more at large, with the addition of critical disquisitions and the advantage of <b>collateral</b> <b>facts,</b> would do well to refer themselves to Mr. Prior's circumstantial volumes, or to the elegant and discursive pages of Mr. Forster.|$|R

This view on the fundamental drivers of the boom is consistent with four empirical observations: the unprecedented rise in home prices and household debt, the stability of debt relative to house values, and the fall in mortgage rates.

It is often {{featured}} {{as a component of}} a sales and marketing strategy in various ways, such as: advertisements, white papers, case studies or within sales <b>collateral.</b> In <b>fact,</b> the term has become quite familiar, yet when a series of value propositions are evaluated it becomes clear that not all value props are created equally. In fact, many of them appear to be mere statements of features and functions rather than fully developed value statements. Although there are no authoritative bodies that regulate or require the use of value propositions, there has been a sequence of development over the past thirty years that have led to guidelines {{for the development of a}} value proposition. This paper will review how to spot a well developed value proposition as well as to determine when a value proposition falls short of the best practice. What is Value? “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder”. This popular concept is especially true discussing value. The term value has many definitions, however, a definition that includes the following concepts begins the process of understanding what illustrating value is all about. Therefore, the following definition is an important first step in understanding what a value proposition is. Value is defined as: Worth in usefulness or importance to the possessor; utility or merit: the value of an education. ...|$|R

The mortgage market occupies one of the main places of financial mechanisms and economic incentives for the sustainable economic development. Mortgage lending covers the provision of long-term bank loans for the purchase, construction of residential real estate, as well as for repairs or to develop their own small businesses, where the collateral for such loans is real estate. Distinctive features of mortgages include: mortgages, like any <b>collateral,</b> in <b>fact,</b> is a way to ensure proper implementation of the other (main) liabilities – loan or credit agreement, lease, contract, compensation, etc.; the subject of a mortgage is always real estate. Real estate includes land plots and everything that is firmly associated with them: buildings, perennial plants, etc.; mortgaged property remains in the possession of the debtor; the agreement between the creditor and the debtor on the establishment of a mortgage is formalized by a special document – the mortgage, which is also subject to state registration. The mortgage crediting is the method of accumulation of financial resources, effective instrument of bank activity, and an important factor in economic development of the country on the whole.

40|$|M. Soc. Sc.) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2005 Small, Micro and Medium Enterprises (SMMEs) {{are often}} {{perceived}} as the backbone of an economy. There is widespread consensus on their significant contribution to economic growth, employment creation, poverty alleviation and local and regional development. In South Africa, a {{lack of access to}} funding, especially to the Previously Disadvantaged Individuals (PDIs), often hinders small businesses from developing their full potential. Funding limitation of SMMEs is mainly due to the high risk attributed to small businesses and their lack of <b>collateral.</b> The <b>fact</b> that SMMEs often receive inadequate financial support or the total lack of it puts them at a competitive disadvantage and tend to harm their long-term growth and development, a waste of entrepreneurial resources and edge, a reduction of productivity and a lower economic growth rate. Restricted access to funding {{is one of the main}} problems faced by tourism-related SMMEs in the North West Province, and can ultimately have an adverse effect on economic growth and overall welfare of the people. This research study presents a sociological evaluation of SMME access and participation in the North West Province, South Africa, tourism industry. The study appeals to an outcome-based evaluation approach of measuring and assessing the degrees and levels to which tourism SMMEs, since the all-inclusive 1994 democratic elections in South Africa, have benefitted. or otherwise from the provincial tourism industry. The study reveals that, ten years after the fall of apartheid, black entrepreneurs' access and participation in the provincial tourism industry, is still limited due to stringent qualification criteria that serve as barriers to accessing financial and developmental support needed to enhance and fast-track meaningful participation in the tourism industry, particularly in the North West Province. The virtual failure to help small business entrepreneurs creates a great controversy about their very existence and effectiveness of such financial institutions with the task of helping up-and-coming black entrepreneurs. This thesis stresses the need for comprehensive evaluation of such institutions so that their existence would have a meaning, more importantly to the PDIS within the tourism industry. The criticisms levelled against these financial support institutions are extensively explored in this study. In conclusion, the study recommends that, in order to make use of the full potential of small business entrepreneurs in the provincial tourism industry, thereby participating meaningfully in the industry, there is the need to provide them with an enabling environment, which encompasses the access to capital and relaxation of the set qualification criteria for financial support.

40|$|In {{order to}} gain insight into the {{function}} of the central nervous system it is of importance to know the lay-out of fiber connections between its constituent cells and cell-groups. Much is already known of the anatomy of the spinal cord and its afferent and efferent fibers; this will be reviewed in Chapter 2. A large part of the spinal neuronal network consists of propriospinal connections representing the anatomical basis for integration of information within the spinal cord itself. The present study was undertaken to investigate propriospinal neurons in more detail. Specifically, a search was made for neurons which project to more than one target area by way of divergent side-branches, or collaterals, of their axon. Earlier anatomical findings already suggested that such "branching" neurons' might be present within the spinal cord. Thus retrograde HRP studies in the cat [254, 286, 288, 359, 416] identified the spinal neurons which give rise to descending propriospinal fibers. The distribution of these neurons largely overlaps that of the neurons giving rise to ascending propriospinal and supraspinal fibers [286, 288]. Therefore some of these neurons may be "branching" neurons which give rise to ascending and descending <b>collaterals.</b> In <b>fact,</b> such neurons were already noted in several Golgi studies [68, 242, 344], but their collaterals could be traced only over short distances. Electrophysiological studies [9, 146, 173, 360] supported these Golgi findings, indicating that some cervical spinal neurons projecting to lumbar levels also give rise to ascending supraspinal collaterals. In the present series of experiments in the rat, an attempt was made: a) to determine the location and relative numbers of such branching neurons in the cervical cord, and b) to approximate the rostral and caudal extent of projection of their collaterals. To this purpose we used the retrograde fluorescent double-labeling method (described in Chapter 3). The results of the first set of experiments (Chapter 4), in which tracer injections were made at various spinal levels, indicated that many neurons in the cervical grey matter in the rat are branching neurons, distributing ascending collaterals to upper cervical or supraspinal levels, and descending collaterals to thoracic or lumbosacral levels. Most descending collaterals of the branching cervical neurons were found to terminate at short distances, i. e. in the upper thoracic cord. On the other hand, the majority of the ascending collaterals were distributed to supraspinal levels. Although the findings suggested that many of these collaterals projected to the caudal brainstem, it remained unsettled whether the supraspinally ascending fibers specifically belonged to any of the various ascending tracts. Therefore, further sets of experiments were designed to clarify this issue, investigating the presence and relative numbers of supraspinal collaterals to the cerebellum (Chapter 5), the thalamus and tectum (Chapter 6) and the dorsal medulla (Chapter 7). Summarizing, the results of the latter series of experiments indicate that relatively many of the supraspinally ascending collaterals are distributed to the medulla, only few to the thalamus and tectum and extremely few to the cerebellum...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular diseases, in {{particular}} coronary artery disease, {{are the leading}} cause of death and disease in industrialized countries. Atherosclerotic changes of the arterial vessel wall constitute one of the major causes for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. Important risk factors for cardiovascular disease have been identified, but they fail to explain why some patients with atherosclerosis become symptomatic and have recurrent symptomatic disease, and others do not. Apart from the extent of coronary atherosclerosis (among other factors), the susceptibility of organs to episodes of ischemia is probably of importance. Well-developed collateral vessels, or "natural bypasses", may offer an important alternative source of blood supply, and thereby protect an organ from episodes of ischemia. Unfortunately, not every organ or even individual has well-developed collateral vessels, if developed at all. Current knowledge on coronary collaterals and its most important determinants involved, are reviewed in Chapter 2. The mechanism of the development of coronary collaterals is subject to increasing preclinical and clinical research. Many factors and patient characteristics have already been proposed to play a role in collateral development. For instance, myocardial ischemia, physical exercise, hypertension, and the use of various cardiovascular drugs. So far, however, for many of these factors, results are inconsistent and, therefore, their pathophysiologic role and importance is still unclear. In addition, the potential clinical relevance of coronary collaterals has attracted much attention. Coronary <b>collaterals</b> may in <b>fact</b> play an important prognostic role in patients with coronary artery disease during episodes of myocardial ischemia. Well-developed coronary collaterals may determine the prognosis of a patient not only in the event of an acute myocardial infarction, but also in stable coronary artery disease. Yet, different findings have been reported so far, as well. Therefore, we first investigated several determinants of the presence and extent of coronary collaterals collectively in a single group of patients, notably cardiac ischemic burden, high blood pressure, smoking and alcohol, and the metabolic syndrome. Second, we investigated the presence and extent of coronary collaterals as a prognostic determinant of cardiovascular outcome in two different studies with different study populations. Several determinants (Chapter 3), already identified as well-established risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, turned out to play an important role in the presence of coronary collaterals, as well. These included cardiac ischemic burden (positive association), high blood pressure (inverse association), and smoking (positive association) and alcohol (J-curve). However, the metabolic syndrome, that encompasses a cluster of impaired glucose metabolism, hypertension, dyslipidemia and central obesity, was not associated. In addition, coronary collaterals turned out to mark an unfavourable prognosis in relatively high-risk patients, but a protective effect in relatively low-risk patients (Chapter 4). We believe that this different effect of coronary collaterals in the various risk groups may explain the conflicting evidence on the protective role of collaterals, reported in the literature, so far. Finally, in Chapter 5 we discuss these different findings by several cardiovascular endpoint-studies in greater detail. The prognostic significance of the presence of coronary collaterals appears to be considerably modified by the patient's risk-level of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, we discuss the different methods, that are currently used to assess coronary collateral circulation, and {{in particular}} their relationship and limitations. We propose that the presence of coronary collaterals may provide an additional marker of myocardial vulnerability, and therefore, an additional marker to identify the "vulnerable patient". In addition, in particular for those patients with myocardial ischemia and at low cardiac risk, who are unsuitable for conventional coronary interventions, therapeutic induction of coronary collateral growth may provide an attractive treatment option...|$|R
