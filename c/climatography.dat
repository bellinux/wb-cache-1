40|$|Fiber-optic sensors provide remote access, {{are readily}} {{embedded}} within structures, and can operate in harsh environments. Nevertheless, fiber-optic sensing of liquids {{has been largely}} restricted to measurements of refractive index and absorption spectroscopy. The temporal dynamics of fluid evaporation have potential applications in monitoring the quality of water, identification of fuel dilutions, mobile point-of-care diagnostics, <b>climatography</b> and more. In this work, the fiber-optic monitoring of fluids evaporation is proposed and demonstrated. Sub-nano-liter volumes of a liquid are applied to inline fiber-optic micro-cavities. As the liquid evaporates, light is refracted out of the cavity at the receding index boundary between the fluid and the ambient surroundings. A sharp transient attenuation in the transmission of light through the cavity, {{by as much as}} 50 dB and on a sub-second time scale, is observed. Numerical models for the transmission dynamics in terms of ray-tracing and wavefront propagation are provided. Experiments show that the temporal transmission profile can distinguish between different liquids...|$|E

University of South Bohemia, Pedagogical faculty, Department of Geography. 128 pages Nuclear power plant Temelin is a dominant, which forms silhouette of the Ceskobudejovicka basin. It is a construction, which faces and resists criticism from environmental organizations. Benefit or threat to South Bohemia? Undoubtebly, the area of disputes between politicians of Czech Republic and Austria. This bachelor thesis evaluates especially climate impacts of Nuclear Power Plant Temelin. Theoretical - methodological base is mainly focused on the discussion of literature, in general and in specific terms researched the topic and related hypotheses. General section then describes the basic physical - geographical characteristics of the selected area, special {{emphasis is placed on}} <b>climatography.</b> An integral part of the general section is a brief description of working the youngest European power plant. The analytical section is dedicated to monitoring climate of surrounding area ETE using data that was recorded by Observatory Czech Hydrometeorological Office in Temelin and the results are compared with data that were recorded during the same period by in České Budějovice. The monitoring of climate surrounding area of Nuclear Power Plant is assessed from two perspectives. The first view sees the climate before the start of nuclear power plants in operation, so from 1989 to 2001; the second look is focused on changes which was formed after the running of nuclear power plants in 2002. The analytical part shows the possible changes in selected climatic characteristics that could be caused by cooling tower plume...|$|E
