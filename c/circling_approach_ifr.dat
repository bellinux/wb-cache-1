50|$|The Korea Aviation Accident Investigation Board {{published}} {{the final report}} in March 2005 {{and concluded that the}} cause of the crash was due to pilot error. The final report stated that the crew was inadvertently flying below the minimum safe altitude. Detailed information from the report also revealed that the pilots were trained to conduct the <b>circling</b> <b>approach</b> in the airline's simulator only for Beijing International Airport and never conducted a simulation for the <b>circling</b> <b>approach</b> to Gimhae Airport's runway 18R. Subsequently, the report also blamed the tower controllers in Gimhae Airport for not using the tower BRITE and MSAW systems when losing visual contact with the flight 129 aircraft.|$|R
50|$|One {{instrument}} approach is available, an NDB or GNSS <b>circling</b> <b>approach.</b> Approach minimums {{are higher than}} average (2,000 feet MSL, 1,982 AGL) due to high terrain in the area.

25|$|The {{approach}} procedure in use for this flight {{in the low}} clouds and low visibility conditions that night required the pilot to fly over the MAC VOR at 3,900 feet, then turn west-northwest to fly out over the water, descend to 1,540 feet and level off within nine miles, then make a left base turn to fly east, back toward the airport (a teardrop procedure turn), and descend for final approach {{with the use of}} the MAC VOR. The pilot was not allowed to descend below 1,540 feet until the turn was completed, and then not below 1,045 feet unless he had the runway in sight. Once the pilot could see the airport from that altitude, he would be allowed to circle and land on the runway of his choice. This is called a circle-to-land manoeuvre, or sometimes a cloud break procedure. The pilot elected to attempt this <b>circling</b> <b>approach</b> to land on runway 29 instead of landing straight in on runway 11, though the reported clouds at the time would have made a <b>circling</b> <b>approach</b> impossible at the minimum altitude of 1,045 feet.|$|R
50|$|Investigators interviewed Captain Wu. Captain Wu Xinlu {{stated that}} as he {{observed}} {{the lights on the}} final approach course to Runway 36L, he saw neither the runway approach lights on the downwind leg nor the circling guidance lights during the <b>circling</b> <b>approach</b> were on. According to the record of the automatic aeronautical light switching system, and the testimony from the Gimhae Tower duty chief, the runway, <b>approach</b> lights and <b>circling</b> guidance lights were on {{at the time of the}} accident.|$|R

50|$|The flight {{took off}} at 08:37 local time (0037 UTC). After nearly 2 hours in flight, it arrived near Gimhae Airport in light rain and mist. At 11:16 local time (0216UTC), CA129 {{received}} clearance to use ILS approach to runway 36L then circle to runway 18R (the same runway {{from the opposite}} direction) from Gimhae tower. During the <b>circling</b> <b>approach</b> to land on runway 18R, the crew exercised poor crew resource management and {{lost sight of the}} runway while delaying the base turn and flying outside of the <b>circling</b> <b>approach</b> area, and crashed into a hill at 11:21 local time (02:21UTC). The aircraft made an initial contact with terrain when its right wing clipped a tree. It then impacted the ground, and the force of the impact broke the airplane apart. The right wing, empennage, left wing, parts of the fuselage and two engines separated. The plane then burst into flames, engulfing the cockpit and forward fuselage. The aircraft slid and destroyed several trees and 12 graves. 37 of those on-board survived, including the Captain. The post impact fire was so hot that it melted the aluminum and other metals of the fuselage. The front part of the fuselage was completely destroyed, making it difficult for investigators to recognize it.|$|R
2500|$|While Flight 202 was {{descending}} to Islamabad, the Captain {{decided to}} change the instrument landing approach to a visual <b>circling</b> <b>approach.</b> The Captain checked the weather apprehensively, and asked the First Officer to feed unauthorized 04 waypoints in the FMS. The First Officer did not challenge the Captain for his incorrect actions (which may {{have been caused by}} the [...] "lecturing session" [...] earlier). The Captain then briefed the First Officer that he would turn the aircraft in the direction of Runway 30, later to abeam 5 miles from the runway and then land.|$|R
50|$|The Hybrid iFR-FFR {{approach}} has been proposed as method of minimising patient exposure to adenosine or other vasodilators. In this <b>approach,</b> an <b>iFR</b> can be measured, and stenoses with an iFR >0.93 may be deferred while those with an iFR <0.86 can be treated by revascularization. Stenoses with an iFR between 0.86-0.93 can undergo an FFR assessment to guide therapy. This range can be changed by the physician according to how closely they want to match an FFR-classification of lesions. Using this typical range, almost 60% of stenoses can be spared from needing vasodilator infusion.|$|R
50|$|Approach Rate is {{a number}} (from 0 to 10) that {{indicates}} how long the hit circles stay on the screen, {{from the moment they}} appear until the time that the <b>approach</b> <b>circles</b> zoom in on the hit <b>circles.</b> Higher <b>approach</b> rates mean that hit circles will be shown for a shorter period of time, giving players less time to react. Inversely, lower approach rates mean that the hit circles will be shown on the screen for a longer time, with the <b>approach</b> <b>circles</b> zooming in slowly. This gives players more time to react to each circle, but can result in an excessive number of circles on the screen if the AR is too low.|$|R
