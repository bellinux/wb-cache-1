5|$|These ants live in nests {{in sandy}} soil which {{sometimes}} have a mound, which resembles a molehill. M. nigrocincta ants labor to conceal their nests using twigs and leaves. Depending {{on the type}} of habitat in which the colony is located, they decorate the nest with plant material and gravel. Other materials that are used to camouflage M. nigrocincta colonies include dry leaves, rocks, vegetation, and twigs. Nests are beside a <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> or bush or {{at the base of a}} tree.|$|E
6000|$|At {{this the}} Queen of the Mice {{stuck her head}} out from {{underneath}} a <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> and asked, in a timid voice, [...] "Are you sure he will not bite us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{might suggest}} {{dropping}} {{it into a}} thick <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass.</b> If you don't mind, we'll stroll out a little way on the prairie. There's too much dust to be pleasant blowing down the street." ...|$|E
50|$|Philochortus zolii digs burrows in {{the sandy}} soil below the <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> <b>grasses</b> and uses its forelimbs to push sand {{out of its}} burrow.|$|R
50|$|Lepidochrysops neavei is a {{butterfly}} in the Lycaenidae family. It {{is found in}} Malawi and Mozambique. The habitat consists of mountainous areas and rocky ground with <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> in Brachystegia woodland.|$|R
50|$|They forage on {{the ground}} singly, in pairs or small flocks for seeds, {{vegetable}} matter and insects, mostly in bare areas between <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> <b>grasses</b> and occasionally in dry rocky watercourses or dry margins of wetlands.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes {{she would}} not notice him at all. Sometimes he would find her shyly peeping at him from behind a <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass.</b> Then Johnny Chuck would try to make himself look very important, and would strut about as if he really did own the Green Meadows.|$|E
60|$|Twinkle {{got up and}} followed, {{keeping her}} eye on the pretty Prince, who leaped so fast {{that she had to}} trot to keep up with him. Nimble would wait on some <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> or bit of rock until the girl came up, and then away he'd go again.|$|E
60|$|No one did she {{see on the}} Green Meadows who {{was looking}} her way. Then Granny Fox began to crawl from one <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> to another and from bush to bush. Sometimes she wriggled along flat on her stomach. Little by little she was drawing nearer and nearer to Peter Rabbit.|$|E
5000|$|On Kilimanjaro D. stairsii also grows {{among the}} heath along with Erica arborea and Erica rossi, is [...] "small pink flowered" [...] and is hidden by <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> <b>grasses</b> {{along with the}} white flowered Anemone thomsonii.|$|R
5000|$|O. vulgare is {{distributed}} {{across much of}} North America. They prefer fields and low meadows, where they perch on <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass.</b> They adapt best in moderate temperature climates, and cannot handle extreme heat or humidity.|$|R
50|$|The {{species of}} Philochortus are diurnal, sun-loving active predators on insects and other arthropods, {{egg-laying}} and terrestrial but P. zolii {{is an avid}} climber. The long stiff tail is aiding in balance on vegetation. They dig burrows in the soil below <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> <b>grasses</b> or small bushes.|$|R
60|$|They floundered {{down the}} declivity, and, though Frank would have {{preferred}} to push on straight for home, Harry insisted on creeping through the long harsh grass about the edge of the water. They tried one of the ponds with no result, but at last Harry dropped suddenly behind a tall <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass.</b>|$|E
60|$|So {{first she}} studied and studied every <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> and every bush behind {{which she could}} creep. She saw that she could get almost to where Peter Rabbit was sitting and never once show herself to him. Then she looked this way and looked that {{way to make sure}} that no one was {{watching}} her.|$|E
6000|$|And as {{he raised}} {{her in his}} arms, the touch of her garment was delicate, and she on her side felt that his speech, {{gestures}} and touch were not those of a rustic shepherd boy; but nothing was said till he had waded through the little narrow stream, and set her down on a fairly firm <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> on the other side. Then she asked, 'What art thou, lad?--Who art thou?' ...|$|E
50|$|Pheropsophus aequinoctialis {{adults are}} nocturnal, often hiding in groups {{during the day}} under stones, logs or <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass,</b> but {{emerging}} in the night to run along sandy trails or riverine beaches. In common {{with other members of}} the tribe Brachinini, they display a crepitating behaviour, and produce quinones.|$|R
50|$|These birds nest on the ground, usually near water. Their nests are shallow {{depressions}} in <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> or moss, {{which are}} lined with fine grasses, twigs and leaves. They lay four, sometimes three, olive-buff to brown eggs. Incubation lasts for 21 days and is done by both sexes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Clumps</b> <b>of</b> tough <b>grass</b> and {{occasional}} <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> heather cover the highest parts, where occasional red grouse may nest.|$|R
60|$|The {{habit of}} hiding becomes so fixed {{with the young}} birds that they trust to it long after the wings have grown and {{they are able to}} escape by flight. Sometimes in the early autumn I have run the bow of my canoe almost over a full-grown bird, lying hidden in a <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass,</b> before he sprang into the air and away. A month later, in the same place, the canoe could hardly {{approach}} within {{a quarter of a mile}} without his taking alarm.|$|E
60|$|Here {{it comes}} {{creeping}} like a furtive and stealthy creature wiping out with thick black cloth here a star {{and there the}} tip of a tall poplar tree, there a shrub, there a <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass!</b> Take care, traveller, take care! that was not just the shadow from the bank, it was a bunch of reeds that entangle the feet and bring the skater down on to his face and will drag him, if he be not swift and alert, right under, into the water under the ice.|$|E
6000|$|... "For winter, yes," [...] replied Nimbleheels. [...] "In summer I {{sometimes}} put my nest just a {{few inches}} under ground, but often I hide it under a piece of bark or in a thick <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass,</b> just as Danny Meadow Mouse often does his. In the fall I dig a deep burrow, deep enough to be {{beyond the reach of}} Jack Frost, and in a nice little bedroom down there I sleep the winter away. I have little storerooms down there too, in which I put seeds, berries and nuts. Then when I do wake up I have plenty to eat." ...|$|E
50|$|If {{there are}} no large trees in the area, <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> or small bushes can be placed inside the bag. If this is done the foliage {{will have to be}} {{replaced}} at regular intervals when water production is reduced, particularly if the foliage must be uprooted to place it in the bag.|$|R
50|$|It {{occurs at}} high altitudes of 2700 - 3800 m in {{treeless}} moorlands. It favors <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> bunch <b>grass</b> for cover.|$|R
50|$|Chestnut teals form monogamous pairs {{that stay}} {{together}} outside the breeding season, defend the nest site and {{look after the}} young when hatched. Nests are usually located over water, in a down-lined tree hollow about 6-10 m high. Sometimes nests are placed on the ground, among <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> near water. The young hatch and are ready to swim and walk within a day.|$|R
60|$|Johnny whispered {{something}} to Bumble the Bee, and Bumble laughed right out loud. Then he buzzed {{up out of}} the doorway, and Johnny crept up to watch. Straight over to where Reddy Fox was squatting behind the <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> flew Bumble the Bee, so swiftly that Johnny could hardly see him. Suddenly Reddy gave a yelp and sprang into the air. Johnny Chuck clapped both hands over his mouth to keep from laughing out loud, for you see Bumble the Bee had stuck his sharp little lance into one of the ears of Reddy Fox.|$|E
60|$|In May, the {{snapping}} turtle, Emysaurus serpentina, {{is frequently}} {{taken on the}} meadows and in the river. The fisherman, taking sight over the calm surface, discovers its snout projecting above the water, at the distance of many rods, and easily secures his prey through its unwillingness to disturb the water by swimming hastily away, for, gradually drawing its head under, it remains resting on some limb or <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass.</b> Its eggs, which are buried {{at a distance from}} the water, in some soft place, as a pigeon-bed, are frequently devoured by the skunk. It will catch fish by daylight, as a toad catches flies, and is said to emit a transparent fluid from its mouth to attract them.|$|E
60|$|They ran straight--it {{was their}} only chance--taking {{whatever}} ground {{came in the}} way--a spread of stinging nettles, an open glade, a <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> out of which a hyæna fled snarling. Then woods again, long stretches of shady leaf-mould and moss under the green trunks. Then a stiff slope, tree-clad, and long vistas of trees, a glade, a succulent green area of black mud, a wide open space again, and then a clump of lacerating brambles, with beast tracks through it. Behind them the chase trailed out and scattered, with Uya ever at their heels. Eudena kept the first place, running light and with her breath easy, for Ugh-lomi carried the Fire Stone in his hand.|$|E
50|$|A. ramsayi {{is found}} in montane heath, woodland, sclerophyll forests, along water bodies, and in swampy areas with thick <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> tussock <b>grass.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Hands and knees!" [...] he said, abruptly, in the {{imperative}} mood, {{pointing to a}} <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> dry <b>grass</b> with thorny bushes ringed about it.|$|R
5000|$|Named [...] "tussock moth" [...] for the {{tufts of}} {{hair on the}} caterpillar. According to Wiktionary, a tussock is a tuft or <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> green <b>grass</b> or similar verdure, forming a small hillock.|$|R
60|$|Prescott {{leaped from}} the trench. There was a roar higher up the ravine, and a turgid flood, {{streaked}} with frothy lines, came pouring down the new channel, bearing with it small nut bushes and great clumps of matted grass. By degrees it subsided, and the men, gathering about {{the edge of}} the muskeg, hot and splashed with mire, lay down to smoke and wait, while the pools that still remained grew smaller. They had been working hard since early morning and they did not talk much, but Prescott, sitting a little away from them, was conscious of an unpleasant tension. It was possible that the search might prove Curtis right. The corporal stood higher up the bank, scanning each <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> and reeds with keenly scrutinizing eyes. At length, however, he approached the others.|$|E
60|$|Very softly Johnny Chuck crept {{along the}} back passageway. Very, very {{cautiously}} he stuck his little black nose out the doorway and sniffed. Yes, he could smell foxes, {{but he knew that}} they were not at his back door. Little by little he crept out until he could peep through the grass. There lay Reddy Fox behind a big <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass,</b> his eyes fixed on Johnny Chuck's front door, and there behind the apple-tree lay Granny Fox taking her ease, but all ready to jump when Reddy should give the word. Johnny Chuck almost giggled out loud as he saw how eagerly Reddy Fox was watching for him. Then Johnny Chuck had an idea that made him giggle harder. His black eyes snapped and he chuckled to himself.|$|E
60|$|When old Granny Fox {{had laid}} down the chicken she was {{bringing}} home to Reddy Fox to try to catch Peter Rabbit, she had meant to go right back and get {{it as soon as}} she had caught Peter. Now she saw Peter going across the Green Meadows, lipperty-lipperty-lip, {{as fast as he could}} go. She was so angry that she hopped up and down. She tore up the grass and ground her long, white teeth. She glared up at Ol' Mistah Buzzard, who had warned Peter Rabbit, but all she could do was to scold, and that didn't do her much good, for in a few minutes Ol' Mistah Buzzard was so far up in the blue, blue sky that he couldn't hear a word she was saying. My, my, but old Granny Fox certainly was angry! If she hadn't been so angry she might have seen Johnny Chuck lying as flat as he could make himself behind a big <b>clump</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} season is variable and {{relies heavily on}} the availability of food. In the south of its range, they tend to breed from spring to early summer and in the north, breeding occurs from early {{to the middle of the}} dry season. The nest is a scrape in the ground, which is lined with grass and twigs, usually between the shelter <b>of</b> <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> or shrubs. Two white eggs are incubated for 16 days, with the young capable of leaving the nest after a week.|$|R
40|$|Sheep graze along a plain in {{twilight}} quiet, Their earthward heads cropping dark <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass,</b> And near them, by a hedge where yellow leaves Grow golden in the evening’s mellowed air, Bent over yarn {{and needles}} knitting wool From these same sheep for mittens [...] two young girls. Then suddenly one rises, shades her eyes And {{gestures to the}} other not to move, One arm crooked and one stretched out like the V’s Of geese intent on their archaic way Beyond the late fall cold toward Galilee. The o [...] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is great!" [...] {{reflected}} the youth. [...] "Here I am, traveling in fine style, without a penny {{to pay any}} one! And I've enough food to last me a month in my coat pocket. This electricity is the proper stuff, after all! And the Demon's a trump, and no mistake. Whee-ee! How small everything looks down below there. The people are bugs, and the houses are soap-boxes, and the trees are like <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass.</b> I seem to be passing over a town. Guess I'll drop down a bit, and take in the sights." ...|$|R
