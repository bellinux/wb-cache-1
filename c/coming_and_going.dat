5|$|Cincinnati {{already had}} a large anti-slavery {{movement}} who had violent conflicts with slavery proponents {{in the years before}} Coffin moved to the city. Coffin purchased a new home at the corner of Elm and Sixth Streets and continued to be active in the Underground Railroad. He also set up a new safe house in the city and helped organize a larger network in the area. At first he was very cautious about helping escaping slaves in the area until he was able to find local people he could trust and the community learned that it could trust him. Although Coffin and his wife moved several times during their years in Cincinnati, they finally settled at a home on Wehrman Street. With the large home's rooms rented out for boarding and its many guests <b>coming</b> <b>and</b> <b>going,</b> the home provided an excellent place to operate an Underground Railroad stop without arousing much suspicion. When fugitives arrived they would be dressed as butlers, cooks, and other workers in uniforms that Catherine had created. Some mulattoes were able to pass as white guests. The most frequent disguise was a Quaker woman's attire; its high collar, long sleeves, gloves, veil, and a large, wide-brimmed hat could completely hide its wearer when their head was tilted slightly downward.|$|E

25|$|In the 18th century, {{the concept}} that {{the age of the}} Earth was millions, if not billions, of years began to appear.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, during the Australian gold rushes, Long Jetty reached {{a period of}} maximum use whereby ships where {{constantly}} <b>coming</b> <b>and</b> <b>going.</b> Even at its full length, {{it was necessary to}} use lightering with smaller vessels to bring in many of the shipments. The opening of Fremantle Harbour eliminated the need for lightering and helped to make Long Jetty obsolete as an importing and exporting structure.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Bond's short video work OTB was {{included}} in Aperto '93 at the Venice Biennale—a survey of international contemporary art.

25|$|Islam came to China {{during the}} Tang dynasty via Iranian traders, who were {{primarily}} concerned with trading and commerce and less concerned with spreading Islam. This low profile is indicated by the 845 anti-Buddhist edict during the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution that said nothing about Islam. It seems that trade rather than evangelism occupied {{the attention of the}} early Muslim settlers; that while they practised their faith in China, they did not campaign against Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, or the State creed, and that they constituted a floating rather than a fixed element of the population, <b>coming</b> <b>and</b> <b>going</b> between China and the West.|$|E

25|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of the Abhidharma is Nirvana and hence the Abhidharmikas systematized dharmas into those which are skillful (kusala), purify the mind and lead to liberation, and those which are unskillful and do not. The Abhidharma then has a soteriological purpose, first and foremost and its goal is to support Buddhist practice and meditation. By carefully watching the <b>coming</b> <b>and</b> <b>going</b> of dhammas, {{and being able to}} identify which ones are wholesome and to be cultivated, and which ones are unwholesome and to be abandoned, the Buddhist meditator makes use of the Abhidharma as a schema to liberate his mind and realize that all experiences are impermanent, not-self, unsatisfactory and therefore not to be clung to.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Brock had started using drum {{machines}} for his home demos and became increasingly frustrated at {{the inability of}} drummers to keep perfect time, leading to a succession of drummers <b>coming</b> <b>and</b> <b>going.</b> First, Griffin was ousted and the band tried King again, but, unhappy with his playing at that time, he was rejected. Andy Anderson briefly joined while he was also playing for The Cure, and Robert Heaton also filled the spot briefly prior {{to the rise of}} New Model Army. Lloyd Langton Group drummer John Clark did some recording sessions, and in late 1983 Rick Martinez joined the band to play drums on the Earth Ritual tour in February and March 1984, later replaced by Clive Deamer.|$|E

Since the Dowager's house is guarded well and since Aomame has disappeared without a trace, Ushikawa decides {{to stake out}} Tengo's apartment {{to see if he}} can find any information related to Aomame. He rents out a room in Tengo's apartment building and sets up a camera to take pictures of the residents. He witnesses Fuka-Eri, who has been hiding out at Tengo's apartment, <b>coming</b> <b>and</b> <b>going</b> from the building. Fuka-Eri seems to realize Ushikawa's presence, as she leaves a note for Tengo and takes off. Ushikawa later sees Tengo return home after a visit to see his dying father. Finally, Ushikawa spots Aomame leaving the building after she herself followed Ushikawa there in order to find Tengo.|$|E

25|$|Ministers {{reported}} that the colonists were typically inattentive, uninterested, and bored during church services. According to the ministers' complaints, the people were sleeping, whispering, ogling the fashionably-dressed women, walking about and <b>coming</b> <b>and</b> <b>going,</b> or at best looking out the windows or staring blankly into space. By 1740, the acute shortage of clergy was easing, and by 1776, there were more Anglican clergy living in Virginia than there were parishes. Devout parishioners used the Book of Common Prayer for private prayer and devotion. This allowed devout Anglicans to lead an active and sincere religious life {{in addition to the}} formal church services. However the stress on private devotion weakened the need for a bishop or a large institutional church of the sort Blair wanted. The stress on personal piety opened the way for the First Great Awakening, which pulled people away from the established church.|$|E
25|$|Skin lesions of Lyme-like disease. Early {{symptoms}} {{in the first}} four weeks after a tickbite include a rash or red patch that gradually expands over several days. It may get quite large (up to 50mm or more in diameter). This rash is called erythema migrans or EM. It can be difficult to distinguish from an allergic reaction {{at the site of the}} bite. Allergic rashes usually occur within 48 hours of the bite, then fade. EM usually first appears after a delay of 48 hours following the tickbite and gets bigger over a few days or weeks. As it expands, EM rash often has a 'target' or 'bullseye' appearance, clearing in the middle with a more obvious red edge. EM can persist for months or years, <b>coming</b> <b>and</b> <b>going</b> in that time. Sometimes many small EM rashes occur. EM may only occur in as few as 20% of persons with Lyme disease.|$|E

25|$|The other {{exception}} {{has to do}} with {{a rather}} peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has convinced me that it is not one of ordinary trance.... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the <b>coming</b> <b>and</b> <b>going</b> of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E
25|$|The Uzlovoy Module (UM), or Node Module is a 4-metric-ton ball-shaped module {{that will}} allow docking of two {{scientific}} and power modules during {{the final stage of}} the station assembly, and provide the Russian segment additional docking ports to receive Soyuz MS and Progress MS spacecraft. UM is due to be launched in late 2018. It will be integrated with a special version of the Progress cargo ship and launched by a standard Soyuz rocket. Progress would use its own propulsion and flight control system to deliver and dock the Node Module to the nadir (Earth-facing) docking port of the Nauka MLM/FGB-2 module. One port is equipped with an active hybrid docking port, which enables docking with the MLM module. The remaining five ports are passive hybrids, enabling docking of Soyuz and Progress vehicles, as well as heavier modules and future spacecraft with modified docking systems. The node module was conceived to serve as the only permanent element of the future Russian successor to the ISS, OPSEK. Equipped with six docking ports, the Node Module would serve as a single permanent core of the future station with all other modules <b>coming</b> <b>and</b> <b>going</b> as their life span and mission required. This would be a progression beyond the ISS and Russia's modular Mir space station, which are in turn more advanced than early monolithic first generation stations such as Skylab, and early Salyut and Almaz stations.|$|E
