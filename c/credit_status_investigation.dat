40|$|College {{students}} now use {{various forms}} of unsecured credit such as private student loans and credit cards to finance college. Access to these credit lines and the interest rates charged on these loans can vary significantly across credit scores. In this paper, we analyze if <b>credit</b> <b>status,</b> as measured by self-reported characteristics of an individual's credit standing, affects college investment. Using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, we study a sample of young high school graduates to estimate how three different measures of <b>credit</b> <b>status</b> affect college attainment and completion rates. After correcting for selection and endogeneity issues, we find that <b>credit</b> <b>status</b> is more important the longer the student stays in college. For example, having bad credit significantly lowers the probability of completing a four-year college degree, but has a smaller (but significant) impact on attaining some college. We find robust evidence that <b>credit</b> <b>status</b> affects the intensive margin of college investment, but is less important for the extensive margin. Our results suggest that bad <b>credit</b> <b>status,</b> which lowers the availability of unsecured credit to finance college and thereby makes college investment more expensive, significantly reduces college completion rates...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays that explore hiring criteria, skill demands and labor market outcomes. The first essay investigates the use of worker <b>credit</b> <b>status</b> as a hiring screen. The practice has sparked debate, with opponents asserting that it amounts to discrimination and proponents maintaining {{that it is an}} important tool for employers to assure the quality of new employees. This study uses a unique identification strategy along with credit proxy variables in a national dataset to test whether <b>credit</b> <b>status</b> reveals information about an employee's character that is predictive of employee productivity. The study finds that the character-related portion of <b>credit</b> <b>status</b> is not a significant predictor of worker productivity. The second essay addresses the question of whether U. S. manufacturers face a skill gap in hiring production workers. This study explores the issue by presenting and analyzing results from an original, nationally representative survey of U. S. manufacturing establishments that directly measures concrete employer skill demands and hiring experiences. The results indicate that demand for higher-level skills is generally modest, and that three quarters of manufacturing establishments do not show signs of hiring difficulties. Among the remainder, demands for higher-level math and reading skills are significant predictors of long-term vacancies, but, contrary to some theories of technical change, demands for computer skills and other critical thinking/ problem-solving skills are not. In terms of mechanisms, factors that complicate the interaction of supply and demand and that are associated with communication/coordination failures appear to play an important role. The third essay combines data from an original manufacturing skill survey with industry-level data on capital and equipment to explore the connection between capital intensity and current skill demands. The results indicate that contemporaneous capital intensity does predict higher level skill demands, but the effect is driven by higher-level reading skills rather than the math and computer skills that dominate the current debate. With regard to historical patterns, the study finds that the relationship between historical capital intensity and current skill demands changes over time, with increasing capital investment per worker showing opposite effects in the 1990 s and 2000 s. 1. <b>Credit</b> <b>status</b> a good signal of productivity?
