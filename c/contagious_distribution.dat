The 2 species present, Thenus indicus Leach, 1815 and Thenus orientalis (Lund, 1793), have mutually exclusive distributions. For each species, relative abundance, size and sex composition were measured monthly and related to physical characteristics including temperature, salinity, depth and sediment type. Both species populations were characterised by <b>contagious</b> <b>distributions.</b> Mean density of T. indicus was 1. 78 (± 0. 15) lobsters ha⁻¹, while that of T. orientalis was 2. 02 (± 0. 13).

40|$|The patch {{nature of}} environments {{combined}} with the behaviour of species determines the spatial arrangement of individuals. This spatial heterogeneity is functional within ecosystems and spatial structuring is therefore {{an important component of}} ecosystems. In this study the spatial distribution of Macorna baithica was determined in the field and combined with two density experiments on the spatial arrangement of individuals. The spatial distribution and abundance of Macoma baithica was studied for two lengthclasses at an intertidal area of Richel in the western Wadden Sea. The depth distribution observed in the field displays a U-shaped relation with length. The preferred size class (_ 18 mm) for Knots, the main predator of Macoma baithica, was buried deepest. Macoma's _ 12. 5 mm were found to exhibit a <b>contagious</b> <b>distribution</b> on a scale of 6 to 1100 metre radius. This in contrast to Macoma's < 12. 5 mm, which showed a random distribution with a slight tendency towards a <b>contagious</b> <b>distribution.</b> The differences in distribution between the two lengthclasses might be attributed to a strategy of timely shifts {{during the first year of}} their lives. Dry and wet habitat sampled cores only showed a difference (not significant) in density at the largest sample size investigated. In the field experiment on Richel there was a strong trend that density influenced depth distribution of Macoma baithica _ 12. 5 mm. The factors length, AFDMSiPhOn, DMsheIl and AFDMmt have an effect on the depth distribution in the field experiment on Richel. In the IBN experiment contagious distributed Macoma's were buried significantly shallower than regular distributed Macoma's, a phenomenon which might be explained by the occurrence of intraspecific competition over food or other favourable conditions. Risk of predation is influenced by the foraging strategy of the predator and may also contribute to this phenomenon. Furthermore a relation was found between burying depth and total horizontal movement, which negatively correlated with each other. With increasing density the total horizontal movement increased significantly. ...|$|E

40|$|Four {{families}} of <b>contagious</b> <b>distributions</b> [...] generalized Poisson distributions, generalized binomial distributions, generalized Pascal distributions, and generalized log-zero distributions [...] are investigated in this thesis. The family of generalized Poisson distributions contains five distributions: the Neyman Type A, the 2 ̆ 2 Short, 2 ̆ 2 the Poisson binomial, the Poisson Pascal, {{and the negative}} binomial. The family of generalized binomial distributions contains eight distributions: the binomial Poisson, the binomial binomial, the binomial Pascal, the binomial log-zero, the Poisson with zeros, the binomial with zeros, the Pascal with zeros, and the log-zero with zeros. The family of generalized Pascal distributions contains four distributions: the Pascal Poisson, the Pascal binomial, the Pascal Pascal, and the Pascal log-zero. The family of generalized log-zero distributions contains four distributions: the log-zero Poisson, the log-zero binomial, the log-zero Pascal, and the log-zero log-zero. For each family of <b>contagious</b> <b>distributions,</b> the common probability generating function based on a biological model is derived by application of Feller 2 ̆ 7 s compound distribution theorem and Gurland 2 ̆ 7 s generalized distribution terminology. The common recurrence relation and the common factorial moments or cumulants are derived from the common probability generating function by using the successive differentiation method. Then for each distribution within this family, the particular probability generating function, recurrence relation, and factorial moments or cumulants are easily obtained from common ones. The equations of factorial moments or cumulants are solved. The maximum likelihood equations are derived for some distributions which {{have been shown to}} provide a good or excellent moment fitting. These equations are solved by an iteration procedure, Except for the Neyman Type A distribution and the 2 ̆ 2 Short 2 ̆ 2 distribution in which the maximum likelihood equations are derived from the probability generating functions and solved by the method of scoring, the maximum likelihood equations a re derived from the probability functions and solved by the Newton-Raphson method. Forty sets of biological and accident data classified into five types have been collected from various sources. A Fortran program has been written for fitting each distribution and a numerical example is given to illustrate the fitting procedure. In comparing the fits among these distributions, the chi-square goodness- of-fit values have been calculated and tabulated. The results suggest that the binomial distribution with zeros and the Pascal distribution with zeros be used if one is to describe the empirical data arising from populations having a contagious character. This is not only {{due to the fact that}} the two distributions have provided better fits to all five types of data, but also the fact that their maximum likelihood estimate procedures have no common disadvantages of other distributions. These disadvantages are that not every moment estimate can allow the iteration process to converge and that the probabilities must be recalculated after each iteration...|$|R

40|$|Physico-chemical {{gradients}} {{and local}} biotic interactions combine at different scales to cause spatial heterogeneity among lake zooplankton. However, current understanding is based overwhelmingly on natural systems {{and there have}} been few assessments of zooplankton spatial pattern in artificial lakes subjected to intensive management. Here, we investigate spatial structure among crustacean zooplankton at scales ranging from 1 m to 2700 m in the newly-formed Cardiff Bay (UK). We hypothesised that zooplankton spatial structuring in Cardiff Bay would be weakened by artificial aeration that was expected to create intense, continuous disturbance that homogenised physico-chemical conditions. Water quality across Cardiff Bay varied only moderately, and variations in zooplankton community composition were weakly related to temperature, oxygen, chlorophyll-a concentration and salinity at scales of around 2 km. However, spatial pattern explained over 60 % of variance in zooplankton composition at the smallest scales (0 - 5 m), implying that inter-specific interactions were involved. Additionally, the numerically dominant zooplankton (Daphnia hyalina (Leydig 1860), Eurytemora affinis (Poppe 1880) and Eucyclops agilis (Koch 1838)) had highly <b>contagious</b> <b>distributions</b> in warmer locations with increased chlorophyll-a reflecting aggregated response to abundant food. These data suggest that local biotic interactions among zooplankton and broader-scale links between dominant species and their algal food are sufficiently intense to persist despite the homogenising effects of artificial aeration and lake mixing.

Two areas were studied: a sandy channel and a muddy sand backwater. Random sampling of the two areas was done to determine the relative densities and dispersions of P. staminea. The organisms were measured for length, height, width, and age. "Size" was determined as a composite of length, height, and width. Age {{was determined by the}} presence of annual rings. The amount of growth in each ring was measured in order to compare yearly growths of bivalves in each area. Sediments were analyzed for particle size, e. g.,silt and clay, fine sand, etc. Bivalves were also taken from the Venice Canal and from Tomales Bay, California for the purpose of comparison. The density of Protothaca s taminea in the muddy sand was three times that in the sandy channel.

Great current velocity inhibits growth in young Protothaca staminea, but moderate current increases growth rate. Current flow is the factor responsible for the weak associations between growth as a function of "size" and certain sediment components in a multivariate correlation analysis.

However, manipulative experiments reveal that post-alighting acceptance is not random; certain plants are accepted repeatedly while others are rejected repeatedly. The results also indicate that searching females distinguish among different classes of plants within a host species.

Methodology/Principal finding: In the present study, an intensive search for the breeding sites of Lutzomyia longipalpis was conducted in urban and peri-urban areas of two municipalities, Promissão and Dracena, which are endemic for visceral leishmaniasis in São Paulo State, Brazil.

In all methods the dominant specie had the <b>contagious</b> <b>distribution.</b> It was found that 55 - 30, 55 - 35, 55 - 25 and 50 - 45 samples should be collected for loop, transect, WP and MWP methods respectively in order to determine the condition of the dominant specie in the vegetation with the deviation of 5 and 10 per cent. Rangeland quality degree was found to be 3, 45; 4, 44; 3, 49 and 3, 08 for loop, transect, WP and MWP methods respectively. Study area was evaluated to be in fair range condition for transect method while it was in poor condition for the rest...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{and density}} of 3 cold-water coral (CWC) species (Madrepora oculata, Lophelia pertusa and Dendrophyllia cornigera) were investigated in the Cap de Creus canyon (north- western Mediterranean) by conducting and analysing 22 video survey transects. Species distribution patterns {{were also investigated}} at 3 spatial extents (km, 100 s of m and m) across 3 of the transects using spatial statistics. Additionally, the locations of snagged benthic long-line fishing gear were logged across these 3 transects. Video surveys were carried out by both remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and the JAGO manned submersible. CWCs were present in 15 of the 22 survey transects, pre- dominantly those covering areas with hard substrate (boulders or hardrock outcrops). M. oculata was the most abundant CWC species in the survey transects, whereas L. pertusa and D. cornigera were much more sparsely distributed, with only isolated colonies observed {{in the majority of}} transects. M. oculata showed a significant <b>contagious</b> <b>distribution</b> pattern across the analysed transects, with sev- eral scales of spatial pattern and patch size being detected, whereas L. pertusa and D. cornigera were not found in sufficient numbers to apply spatial statistics. Different covariance patterns were found across the transects between snagged fishing gear and the presence of M. oculata. Further investi- gation of this relationship and the level of hazard posed by long-line fishing to M. oculata colonies is required prior to development of a protective management strategy...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} patterns of freshwater pearl mussels, Margaritifera margaritifera (L.), in the River Kerry, north-western Scotland were investigated, {{together with their}} relationships {{to a number of}} physical parameters (distance from nearest bank, mean water depth, mean current velocity, substratum descriptors, aquatic vegetation cover). The mussels exhibited a highly <b>contagious,</b> non-random spatial <b>distribution</b> pattern. Adult and juvenile M. margaritifera were found to have broadly similar habitat ‘preferences’, although adults were found over a wider range of physical conditions. Based on computed habitat suitability curves, optimum water depths of 0. 3 – 0. 4 m and optimum current velocities of 0. 25 – 0. 75 ms 1 at intermediate water levels were observed. River bed substratum characterisitics appear to be the best physical parameters for describing M. margaritifera habitat. Boulder-stabilised refugia, which contain enough sand for burrowing, are ideal microhabitats for juvenile mussels. Adults are able to tolerate silty or muddy conditions for unknown lengths of time, but juveniles are never found in this type of habitat. Substratum-based discriminant function models were used to predict {{the presence or absence of}} mussels, with a success rate of 76 – 92 %...|$|R
40|$|An {{exploratory}} floristic {{survey of}} the genus Mimosa was conducted in 1993 to ascertain species diversity and their spatial patterns of distribution in Peninsular Malaysia. A new species record of uncertain indigene, M [...] quadrivalvis was recorded {{for the first time}} in restricted localities along the roadsides in Pekan Darat and Bertam, Seberang Perai, Gurun and Bedong in Kedah in addition to widely distributed and seemingly ubiquitous presence of M. invisa Mart. ex. Colla and M. pudica L. The latter two species were mostly found in open, disturbed and derelict habitats, agricultural areas and ex-mining lands. Both species exhibited largely <b>contagious</b> and overdispersed <b>distribution</b> patterns with positive peaks in pattern intensity values although regularity or underdispersed distribution patterns do manifest in certain localities. The giant mimosa, M. pigra inhabited in clustered thickets, large pockets of lands in the urban and sub-urban localities in the states of Penang, Perak, Kelantan, Kuala Lumpur and Negeri Sembilan. In other states, M. pigra was confined to a few localities in smaller patches. Except for M. quadrivalvis, the other species of Mimosa are serious weeds in the agricultural, recreational and residential and derelict areas. A key to the Mimosa species is constructed along with brief descriptions on their morphology and ecology...|$|R
40|$|A distribuição espacial de Paepalanthus polyanthus foi avaliada em função da variação topográfica e da cobertura vegetal associada, em um trecho de baixada úmida de dunas na Praia da Joaquina, Florianópolis, SC. Foram delimitadas 4 transecções, ao longo das quais, quadrados de 0. 5 m² foram dispostos de maneira contínua. A densidade de P. polyanthus e a porcentagem de cobertura vegetal foram determinadas para cada quadrado amostrai, registrando-se também, as espécies de maior cobertura. Em todas as transecções, P. polyanthus apresentou um padrão de distribuição agregado (índice de dispersão de Morisita Id> 1, P The {{distribution}} Pattern of Paepalanthus polyanthus was surveved {{in relation}} to topography variation and associated vegetation cover in a sand dune slack. Praia da Joaquina, Florianópolis, State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Quadrats of 0. 5 m² were settled continuously along 4 line transects. The density of P. polyanthus, the percentage cover and the predominant species were determined in each quadrat. P. polyanthus showed a <b>contagious</b> pattern of <b>distribution</b> (Dispersion index of Morisita Id> 1, P< 0. 001) in all transects. The individual were concentrated in intermediary areas of the microrelief. P. polyanthus was not observed at elevated sand dune areas, also characterized by lower percentage cover. At lake shores and flooded sites its density was low or the species absent. The factors limiting the distribution of P. polyanthus are discussed on aspects of its population dynamics. P. polyanthus exhibits high mortality after inundation and in higher sand dune areas lower emergence and seedling survival are observed, mainly in periods of low pluviosity. A negative association with Ischaemum minus is suggested and possibly explained by eventual floods or by interference of the dense cover of this grass species on germination and growth of P. polyanthus...|$|R
