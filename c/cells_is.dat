In a single cerebellar module, input from {{as many as}} a billion parallel fibers converges onto a group of less than 50 deep nuclear cells, and the influence of each parallel fiber on those nuclear <b>cells</b> <b>is</b> adjustable.

5|$|Development of an endometrial {{hyperplasia}} (overgrowth of endometrial <b>cells)</b> <b>is</b> {{a significant}} risk factor because hyperplasias can and often do develop into adenocarcinoma, though cancer can develop without {{the presence of}} a hyperplasia. Within ten years, 8–30% of atypical endometrial hyperplasias develop into cancer, whereas 1–3% of non-atypical hyperplasias do so. An atypical hyperplasia is one with visible abnormalities in the nuclei. Pre-cancerous endometrial hyperplasias are also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Mutations in the KRAS gene can cause endometrial hyperplasia and therefore Type I endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia typically occurs after the age of 40. Endometrial glandular dysplasia occurs with an overexpression of p53, and develops into a serous carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|EFS regulates T-cell {{function}} and maturation, preventing expansion of autoreactive clones and pathological immune responses. Two {{studies that have}} reported that EFS expression in medullar thymus epithelial <b>cells</b> <b>is</b> important for negative selection of T-cells during their development, which implies an important role of EFS in maintaining immune homeostasis and autoimmunity prevention. In these studies, mice with defective EFS progressed normally during embryogenesis but then developed massive inflammatory lesions in multiple tissues that bore a striking histological resemblance to inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease. Mechanistically, EFS expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is crucial for their functional maturation and growth factor-mediated expansion. mTECs are important for proper T-cell maturation and negative selection of autoreactive clones, required for development of immunological self-tolerance.|$|E
5|$|Penetration follows attachment: Virions {{enter the}} host cell through receptor-mediated {{endocytosis}} or membrane fusion. This {{is often called}} viral entry. The infection of plant and fungal <b>cells</b> <b>is</b> {{different from that of}} animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall. However, nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata. Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell. However, given that bacterial cell walls are much less thick than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside.|$|E

5|$|Rule 90 is an {{elementary}} cellular automaton. That {{means that it}} consists of a one-dimensional array of cells, each of which holds a single binary value, either 0 or 1.

A pre-specified rule determines the new value of each cell as a function of its previous value and of the values in its two neighboring cells. All cells obey the same rule, which may be given either as a formula or as a rule table that specifies the new value for each possible combination of neighboring values.|$|E
5|$|She {{observed}} {{the effects of}} the transposition of Ac and Ds by the changing patterns of coloration in maize kernels over generations of controlled crosses, and described {{the relationship between the two}} loci through intricate microscopic analysis. She concluded that Ac controls the transposition of the Ds from chromosome9, and that the movement of Ds is accompanied by the breakage of the chromosome. When Ds moves, the aleurone-color gene is released from the suppressing effect of the Ds and transformed into the active form, which initiates the pigment synthesis in cells. The transposition of Ds in different <b>cells</b> <b>is</b> random, it may move in some but not others, which causes color mosaicism. The size of the colored spot on the seed is determined by stage of the seed development during dissociation. McClintock also found that the transposition of Ds is determined by the number of Ac copies in the cell.|$|E

Therefore, in models of prenatal cocaine exposure both migration and maturation of these progenitor <b>cells</b> <b>is</b> delayed.|$|E

5|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) is a membranous synthesis and transport organelle {{that is an}} extension of the nuclear envelope.

This highly convoluted space is called the ER lumen and is also referred to as the ER cisternal space. The lumen takes up about ten percent of the entire cell volume. The {{endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane allows molecules to be selectively transferred between the lumen and the cytoplasm, and since it is connected to the nuclear envelope, it provides a channel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{reaction}} of infected <b>cells</b> <b>is</b> to produce interferon, a cytokine that raises {{a number of}} defenses against viral infection through the innate immune system by augmenting {{the production of a}} large group of proteins mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway.

Interferon also activates the adaptive immune system, which leads to the generation of antibodies against the virus as well as T cells that directly attack any cell infected with the virus. Various antibodies are generated; some bind closely to the viral proteins and target them for phagocytosis (ingestion by specialized cells and destruction), but some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not destroyed but is able to replicate further.|$|E
