40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at generalizing the {{theoretical}} provisions on <b>controlling</b> of <b>marketing</b> in enterprise: to clarify the place of <b>controlling</b> of <b>marketing</b> within the management system, constituents, goals, tasks, and functions. The <b>controlling</b> of <b>marketing</b> was considered in terms of concepts such as management of enterprise, management of marketing, operative management of <b>marketing,</b> <b>controlling,</b> strategic and operational <b>controlling</b> of <b>marketing,</b> and operative management of marketing costs. The constituents and tools of <b>controlling</b> of <b>marketing</b> at the strategic and the operational levels have been defined. The definition of operative <b>controlling</b> of <b>marketing</b> has been revised, which emphasizes managerial decision-making about marketing costs, taking account of current situation and optimality of such costs as to purposes of enterprise. A systematic approach to studying this issue provides a holistic view of <b>controlling</b> of <b>marketing</b> within the enterprise management system. A study on the theoretical aspects of <b>controlling</b> of <b>marketing</b> as a modern management concept {{will make it possible}} to approach the issue of decision-making on marketing activity in a holistic manner...|$|R

50|$|From the right, {{critics say}} that developmentalist {{strategies}} deny the free market its autonomy.

In turn, it is argued, reactive totalitarian forces take hold of the government in response to Western intervention, such as ChÃ¡vez's Venezuela and Ortegaâ€™s Nicaragua, creating even more complex problems for the Western vision of development.|$|E

50|$|A {{little later}} in the year 1901, the Berlin Secessionists entered the scene, {{accompanied}} by the art dealers Bruno Cassirer and especially his cousin Paul, who set the pace for the years to come. In the last days of December, running through January 1902, Paul Cassirer organized the first van Gogh exhibition in Berlin, Germany. Minor exhibitions of some recently found early works were held in Rotterdam and Amsterdam in 1903 and 1904. March 5-22, 1908 Paul Cassirer organized another expo in Berlin which included the painting Peach Blossoms in the Crau lent by Anna Boch. Cassirer first established a market for Van Gogh, and then, with the assistance of Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, <b>controlled</b> <b>market</b> prices.

40|$|Instead of {{emphasize}} the "primacy of planning" in management process <b>marketing</b> <b>control</b> {{should be viewed}} as an activity that counterbalances marketing planning and strategy, and not as a "post hoc" adjunct to the planning function. Rather, it is a separate marketing function, which by continuously checking on the validity of plans, provides time and flexibility to an organization. Therefore, in this view, <b>marketing</b> planning and <b>control</b> are counterbalances processes which are performed simultaneously. The essence of feedback control is a measurement of the actual and desired states after action has been taken, and a subsequent correction of activities. In feedforward control the activities are corrected by predicting whether current activities would lead to desired states. The single most important reason why feedforward control is different from feedback control is that its use of information is prognostic. While feedback control tries to solve problems that have occurred, feedforward control tries to discover problems waiting to occur. It is also important to distinguish between financial non-financial and multiple control. Financial <b>control</b> of <b>marketing</b> activities involves <b>control</b> of sales revenue, profitability and return on marketing investment (ROMI). Non-financial <b>control</b> of <b>marketing</b> activities consists of <b>control</b> <b>market</b> share, customer satisfaction, customer loyalty, brand equity and customer equity. Key components of multiple <b>control</b> <b>marketing</b> activities are <b>control</b> of efficiency, effectiveness and marketing audit. Marketing performance measures have moved in three consistent directions over the years: from financial to non-financial output measures, from output to input measures and from undimensional to multidimensional measures...|$|R

5000|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{he comes}} {{under fire for}} defending desert as a principle of social justice. A deterministic {{view of the world}} leads to the conclusion that we are not responsible for our skills, talents or abilities (including our ability to work to improve any natural talents) therefore it is unjust to be rewarded for them. This is argued by Rawls. Of course, if determinism is rejected (as a majority of academic philosophers have done), then the idea of morally valued [...] "merit" [...] can have intellectual [...] "merit." [...] Many argue that meritocracy is a fundamental principle of the United States and to reject this idea is to vitiate our society of one of its core values. Rawls merely asserts his position on merit. The opposite position can also be, just as legitimately and with as much intellectual support, asserted. Miller proposes that desert can be allocated through a strictly <b>controlled</b> <b>market</b> (to limit too much inequality). But others say that the objects or talents that the 'market' (that is, society) put economic value upon is not a just way to determine what is deserving.|$|E
