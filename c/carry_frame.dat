Standards for horse breeds which do not <b>carry</b> <b>frame</b> or splash spotting patterns, such as the Arabian and Clydesdale, do not consider sabino to be an overo pattern, but sometimes classify sabino horses as roan. To confuse matters further, in Spanish-speaking countries, the term [...] "overo" [...] actually refers to horses with what is called [...] "sabino" [...] in English; meanwhile, in South America, the term [...] "sabino", which literally translated from Spanish means [...] "speckled" [...] or sometimes [...] "roan", refers to a flea-bitten gray.|$|E

As <b>carrying</b> <b>frame</b> make by Polyphenylene Sulfide in Portable Exoskeleton to the {{research}} object, establish the 3 D model of <b>carrying</b> <b>frame</b> {{on the basis of}} the configuration parameters of Human body backside, and implement the strength and stiffness analysis through the ANSYS software. The analysis is divided into three portions in accordance with working conditions, bending with no support, bending with human support and swaying with human support. Thereinto three portions have the same payload as 45 kg and the same bending range attains 45 degree. Ultimately Stress value, quantity and distribution chart of the deformation have been obtained for each portion. Analysis results show that the each direction deformation Maximum and the stress Maximum of the <b>carrying</b> <b>frame</b> which bend without support present linear growth along with the increase of the bending angle in the course of the bending over. Therefore it causes the larger concentration of stress and deformation in the <b>carrying</b> <b>frame</b> and causes the additional load in the body. So the working conditions for <b>carrying</b> <b>frame</b> should be avoided which bend without support. To the rest of the two conditions, the stress and deformation of <b>carrying</b> <b>frame</b> are small enough to be meeting the use requirements...|$|R

2500|$|The {{designers}} {{of the new}} Parliament House were mindful {{of the need to}} provide an appropriate space to display The Big Picture in the new building. The Joint Standing Committee responsible for the new building made the decision to place the painting in the Main Committee Room Foyer.

Because the fragile state of the picture prevented it from being rolled, moving the painting from the High Court to Parliament House was a major logistical exercise.

50|$|Wartime sets {{generally}} {{required a}} 6 V or 12 V supply, and batteries were charged {{by a small}} petrol-engined charging set (generator) of 300 W, often the 'Chorehorse' type.

In the case of the 19 set, a composite power supply that allowed 12 V, two-wire 24 V and 3-wire (i.e. 0 - 12 - 24 V) systems was introduced. This power supply also contained a vibrator type HT section so that the receiver section of the set could be run more economically.|$|R
