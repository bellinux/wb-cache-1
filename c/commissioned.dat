To test the old neo-functionalist claim on loyalty transfer among civil servants, {{this article provides}} fresh survey and interview data on seconded national experts in the <b>Commission.</b> The transformative powers of the <b>Commission</b> are tested by assessing {{the extent to which}} seconded national experts adopt supranational role perceptions. Theoretically, the emergence of supranational role perceptions is accounted for by considering (i) processes of pre-socialisation outside the <b>Commission,</b> (ii) processes of resocialisation inside the <b>Commission,</b> and (iii) organisational incompatibility between the <b>Commission</b> and domestic ministries and agencies from which the secondees originate. The empirical analysis shows that secondees evoke multiple loyalties, notably towards own profession, own DG and Unit and towards the EU and the <b>Commission</b> as wholes. Crucially, the data reported demonstrate that the <b>Commission</b> indeed instils supranational role perceptions into secondees. This observation reflects processes of re-socialisation inside the <b>Commission,</b> the organisational composition of the <b>Commission</b> as well as organizational incompatibilities between the <b>Commission</b> and domestic ministries and agencies. The data does not report robust evidence of pre-socialisation outside the <b>Commission.</b> Hence, the <b>Commission</b> is indeed a ‘hothouse for supranationalism’...|$|R
