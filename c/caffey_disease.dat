40|$|Infantile {{cortical}} hyperostosis (<b>Caffey</b> <b>disease)</b> {{is a rare}} self-limiting inflammatory bony {{disease of}} early infancy. We report a 1 -month-old Chinese boy with <b>Caffey</b> <b>disease</b> who presented with painful swelling over his shins bilaterally. Physical abuse was initially suspected, but the radiological findings of periosteal thickening over multiple bones (particularly the mandible), symmetrical involvement, diaphyseal involvement with sparing of the epiphysis, made <b>Caffey</b> <b>disease</b> a likely diagnosis. This report highlights that infantile cortical hyperostosis is an important differential diagnosis for children suspected of being abused, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion to avoid misdiagnosis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Infantile {{cortical}} hyperostosis (also {{known as}} <b>Caffey</b> <b>disease)</b> {{is characterized by}} hyperirritability, acute inflammation of soft tissues, and profound alterations of the shape {{and structure of the}} underlying bones, particularly the long bones, mandible, clavicles, or ribs. In this issue of the JCI, Gensure et al. undertook fine mapping of the genetic locus for this disease in a large kindred of individuals with the autosomal dominant form of the condition. The authors found a novel missense mutation in COL 1 A 1, the gene encoding the α 1 chain of type I collagen, in all affected individuals in 3 discrete pedigrees. This is a surprising finding, as all other reported mutations affecting the synthesis of type I collagen lead to conditions such as osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, in which quantitative or qualitative defects in type I collagen synthesis give rise to bone fragility and/or connective tissue hyperextensibility. The deleterious effect of the mutation on collagen fibril morphology is demonstrated; however, the precise functional link between the reported missense mutation and the localized inflammation and hyperostosis seen in <b>Caffey</b> <b>disease</b> awaits future studies...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} a fetus of 27 weeks of {{gestation}} whose clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings are compatible with the prenatal form of <b>Caffey</b> <b>disease</b> (cortical hyperostosis). Prenatal ultrasound examination showed polyhydramnios and markedly short and angulated long bones, which had led to the incorrect diagnosis of lethal osteogenesis imperfecta. We found 43 published descriptions on the antenatal onset of cortical hyperostosis symptomatic in utero or at birth. Two groups of prenatal cortical hyperostosis (PCH) can be distinguished: (1) severe (25 reports and the fetus presented here), with onset before 35 weeks of gestation and generally associated with polyhydramnios, lung disease, prematurity, and high lethality; (2) mild (18 reports), with onset after 35 weeks of gestation and without complications. Autosomal recessive inheritance has been suggested for the prenatal form of cortical hyperostosis. However, the available evidence suggests that both dominant and recessive inheritance is possible. Moreover, dominant inheritance {{seems to be more}} common in the mild prenatal form of cortical hyperostosis...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{hereditary}} form of {{infantile cortical hyperostosis}} (ICH), {{known as}} <b>Caffey</b> <b>disease,</b> was recently found {{to be caused by}} a heterozygous 3040 C → T mutation in the COL 1 A 1 gene. Objective: To determine whether a similar mutation was also responsible for a sporadic case of ICH. Methods: We identified a Thai male infant who was a sporadic case of ICH. He had symmetric cortical hyperostosis of all of his long bones, clavicles, and ribs occurring after a prolonged infusion of prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1) for a cyanotic congenital heart disease. Mutation analysis of COL 1 A 1 was performed in the patient and his parents by restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products. Results: The particular mutation was not found in our case and in his parents. A follow-up after 15 months demonstrated that the child had normal growth and development. Repeated imaging studies revealed markedly decreased cortical thickenings of the affected bones. Conclusion: Our findings confirm that PGE 1 -induced cortical hyperostosis is reversible and does not associate with the COL 1 A 1 3040 C→T mutation...|$|E
40|$|One to {{two percent}} of all {{children}} are born with a developmental disorder requiring pediatric hospital admissions. For many such syndromes, the molecular pathogenesis remains poorly characterized. Parallel developmental disorders in other species could provide complementary models for human rare diseases by uncovering new candidate genes, improving {{the understanding of the}} molecular mechanisms and opening possibilities for therapeutic trials. We performed various experiments, e. g. combined genome-wide association and next generation sequencing, to investigate the clinico-pathological features and genetic causes of three developmental syndromes in dogs, including craniomandibular osteopathy (CMO), a previously undescribed skeletal syndrome, and dental hypomineralization, for which we identified pathogenic variants in the canine SLC 37 A 2 (truncating splicing enhancer variant), SCARF 2 (truncating 2 -bp deletion) and FAM 20 C (missense variant) genes, respectively. CMO is a clinical equivalent to an infantile cortical hyperostosis (<b>Caffey</b> <b>disease),</b> for which SLC 37 A 2 is a new candidate gene. SLC 37 A 2 is a poorly characterized member of a glucose-phosphate transporter family without previous disease associations. It is expressed in many tissues, including cells of the macrophage lineage, e. g. osteoclasts, and suggests a disease mechanism, in which an impaired glucose homeostasis in osteoclasts compromises their function in the developing bone, leading to hyperostosis. Mutations in SCARF 2 and FAM 20 C have been associated with the human van den Ende-Gupta and Raine syndromes that include numerous features similar to the affected dogs. Given the growing interest in the molecular characterization and treatment of human rare diseases, our study presents three novel physiologically relevant models for further research and therapy approaches, while providing the molecular identity for the canine conditions...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in the COL 1 A 1 and COL 1 A 2 genes, {{encoding}} the proalpha 1 and 2 {{chains of}} type I collagen, cause osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) arthrochalasis type. Although {{the majority of}} missense mutations in the collagen type I triple helix affect glycine residues in the Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeat, few nonglycine substitutions have been reported. Two arginine-to-cysteine substitutions in the alpha 1 (I) -collagen chain are associated with classic EDS [R 134 C (p. R 312 C) ] or autosomal dominant <b>Caffey</b> <b>disease</b> with mild EDS features [R 836 C (p. R 1014 C) ]. Here we show alpha 1 (I) R-to-C substitutions in three unrelated patients who developed iliac or femoral dissection in early adulthood. In addition, manifestations of classic EDS in Patient 1 [c. 1053 C>T; R 134 C (p. R 312 C); X-position] or osteopenia in Patients 2 [c. 1839 C>T; R 396 C (p. R 574 C); Y-position] and 3 [c. 3396 C>T; R 915 C (p. R 1093 C); Y-position] are seen. Dermal fibroblasts from the patients produced disulfide-bonded alpha 1 (I) -dimers in approximately 20 % of type I collagen, which were efficiently secreted into the medium in case of the R 396 C and R 915 C substitution. Theoretical stability calculations of the collagen type I heterotrimer and thermal denaturation curves of monomeric mutant alpha 1 (I) -collagen chains showed minor destabilization of the collagen helix. However, dimers were shown to be highly unstable. The R 134 C and R 396 C caused delayed procollagen processing by N-proteinase. Ultrastructural findings showed collagen fibrils with variable diameter and irregular interfibrillar spaces, suggesting disturbed collagen fibrillogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that R-to-C substitutions in the alpha 1 (I) chain {{may result in a}} phenotype with propensity to arterial rupture in early adulthood. This broadens the phenotypic range of nonglycine substitutions in collagen type I and has important implications for genetic counseling and follow-up of patients carrying this type of mutation.
