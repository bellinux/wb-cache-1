Among the {{earliest}} and most spectacular large sculptures produced by <b>copper</b> <b>electrotyping</b> were twelve gilt angels (ca. 1858) by Josef Hermann that {{stand in the}} cupola of Saint Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg, Russia. These sculptures are [...] tall; the metal needed to be thin enough so that {{the weight of the}} sculptures could be supported high above the cathedral's floor.|$|R
2500|$|From 1890 {{through at}} least 1930, the Abteilung für Galvanoplastic of the WMF Company in Germany {{produced}} many statues and other items using electrotyping. The statues in particular were significantly less expensive than bronze castings. Memorials in German cemeteries from this era often incorporated electroptyped statues from models that had been commissioned by WMF from well-known sculptors (see photograph F below). WMF also undertook larger commissions. One example is the full-sized <b>copper</b> <b>electrotype</b> (1911) of Ernst Rietschel's 1857 bronze for the Goethe–Schiller Monument in Weimar, Germany, which is about [...] tall (see photograph at right).|$|R
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{applications}} of electrotyping was in printing. Initially, electrotyping was used to make copper reproductions of engraved metal plates or wooden carvings, which were used to print artwork. The electrotypes could be incorporated along with movable type to compose the s for printing. Jacobi published his first account of electrotyping in October 1838. In 1839, electrotyping was used by Russian printers for government documents; the Russian Czar Nicholas I had immediately become an enthusiastic supporter and patron of the technology. In England, the first use of electrotyping for printing appeared in the London Journal of April 1840, and other English examples are known from later in that year. The image to the right shows {{one of the earliest}} uses of electrotyping in the United States; it is a comparison done by Joseph Alexander Adams in 1841 of the printed image prepared directly from a wood carving and of the image printed from a <b>copper</b> <b>electrotype</b> copy. <b>Electrotyped</b> <b>copper</b> plates could be formed into cylinders, which was valuable for use in magazine and newspaper printing.|$|R

50|$|The {{use of a}} flat {{recording}} surface {{instead of}} a cylindrical one was an obvious alternative which thought-experimenter Charles Cros initially favored and which practical experimenter Thomas Edison and others actually tested in the late 1870s and early 1880s. The oldest surviving example is a <b>copper</b> <b>electrotype</b> of a recording cut into a wax disc in 1881. The commercialization of sound recording technology was initially aimed at use for business correspondence and transcription into writing, in which the cylindrical form offered certain advantages, the storage {{of large numbers of}} records seemed unlikely, and the ease of producing multiple copies was not a consideration.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first three}} Goethe-Schiller monuments in the US were in San Francisco (1901), Cleveland (1907), and Milwaukee (1908). They all {{incorporated}} bronze sculptures cast at the foundry in Lauchhammer, Germany; the original sculpture in Weimar {{is also a}} bronze casting. The statue in Syracuse is not a casting; it consists of thin copper pieces that are joined together. The statue has a small plaque attached to its base that reads [...] "Galvanoplastik-Geislingen St.", which indicates that it {{was made by the}} Abteilung für Galvanoplastik (Galvanoplastic Division) of the WMF Company in Geislingen an der Steige, Germany. Galvanoplastik is a German word encompassing both electrotyping and electroforming. The pieces were fabricated using the electrotyping process, which involves the depositing of copper metal from a solution of chemicals onto the inside of a mold. The process is activated by electrical currents flowing between wires immersed in the solution and a coating on the mold; the coating and the solution both conduct electricity. As in the Syracuse statue, large electrotyped sculptures typically consist of <b>electrotyped</b> <b>copper</b> pieces that are joined together, most likely by soldering. The individual pieces in electrotyped sculptures are a fraction of an inch thick, and one surface conforms very exactly to the details of the mold. The Syracuse sculpture is apparently the only copy of Rietschel's statue that was produced using <b>copper</b> <b>electrotyping,</b> and may be the only public artwork in the United States that was produced by WMF.|$|R
25|$|Electrotyping is {{activated}} by electric currents that flow between anode wires {{that are also}} immersed in the solution and the wire connected to the coated mold (the cathode). For <b>copper</b> <b>electrotyping,</b> a typical aqueous electrolyte contains copper sulfate (CuSO4) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and the anode is also copper; the arrangement is illustrated in the figure. The electric current causes copper atoms to dissolve from the anode's surface and to enter the electrolyte as copper ions (Cu++ in the figure). Copper ions are {{taken up by the}} mold's conducting surface at the same rate at which copper dissolves from the anode, thus completing the electrical circuit. When the copper layer on the mold grows to the desired thickness, the electric current is stopped. The mold and its attached electrotype are removed from the solution, and the electrotype and the mold are separated. An animation of the electrotyping process was produced in 2011 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Other metals besides copper can be electrotyped; similar procedures apply, but each different metal needs its own anode and electrolyte chemicals.|$|R
50|$|In {{letterpress}} typography {{the matrix}} of one letter is {{inserted into the}} bottom of a hand mould, the mould is locked and molten type metal is poured into a straight-sided vertical cavity above the matrix. When the metal has cooled and solidified the mould is unlocked and the newly cast metal sort is removed, ready for composition with other sorts. The matrix can then be reused to produce more copies of the sort. The matrix will be made by driving a punch of the type to be made into soft <b>copper,</b> or <b>electrotyping</b> a matrix from a piece of type.|$|R
50|$|The large {{block of}} wood was then {{separated}} into its constituent pieces and {{turned over to the}} engraving department, which meticulously carved out the white sections, leaving the black illustration in relief. The sections of the wood block were then rejoined and sent to the composing room, where the illustration was converted to part of an <b>electrotyped</b> <b>copper</b> plate for printing.|$|R
50|$|Auer's method {{can only}} be used with objects with tolerably flat surfaces, such as dried and pressed plants, {{embroidery}} and lace, and a very few animal productions. The object is placed between a plate of steel and another of lead, {{both of which are}} smooth, and polished. They are then drawn through a pair of rollers under considerable pressure. When the plates are separated, it is found that a perfect impression of the object has been made in the leaden plate. This may be used directly as an engraved plate, but only if a very few impressions are wanted, for it is too soft to resist the action of printing presses for practical purposes. For larger numbers of images, a facsimile to be used as the printing plate is made in <b>copper</b> by the <b>electrotype</b> process.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{additional}} monuments {{based on}} Rietschel's bronze were raised {{over the next}} decade. The Cleveland, Ohio monument in Wade Park was dedicated on June 9, 1907. Wilhelm II, the German Emperor, sent a congratulatory cable, to which {{the head of the}} Goethe-Schiller Memorial Committee responded, [...] "Emperor Wilhelm, Berlin. Goethe-Schiller Memorial unveiled in presence of 65,000 persons. In this sacred hour American citizens of Cleveland of German origin respectfully thank Your Majesty for his good wishes." [...] The Milwaukee, Wisconsin monument in Washington Park was dedicated on June 12, 1908 before 35,000 people. The bronze statues for the Cleveland and Milwaukee monuments had also been cast by the Lauchhammer foundry. The statue for the Syracuse monument is <b>electrotyped</b> <b>copper,</b> and not a bronze casting. It was sited in Schiller Park, which had been renamed in 1905 to honor the centennial of Schiller's death. The monument was dedicated on October 15, 1911.|$|R
2500|$|Electrotyping (also galvanoplasty) is a {{chemical}} method for forming metal parts that exactly reproduce a model. The method {{was invented by}} Moritz von Jacobi in Russia in 1838, and was immediately adopted for applications in printing and several other fields. As described in an 1890 treatise, electrotyping produces [...] "an exact facsimile of any object having an irregular surface, whether it be an engraved steel- or copper-plate, a wood-cut, or a form of set-up type, {{to be used for}} printing; or a medal, medallion, statue, bust, or even a natural object, for art purposes." [...] In art, several important [...] "bronze" [...] sculptures created in the 19th century are actually <b>electrotyped</b> <b>copper,</b> and not bronze at all; sculptures were executed using electrotyping at least into the 1930s. In printing, electrotyping had become a standard method for producing plates for letterpress printing by the late 1800s. It complemented the older technology of stereotyping, which involved metal casting. By 1901, stereotypers and electrotypers in several countries had formed labor unions around these crafts. The unions persisted into the 1970s, but by the late 20th century, after more than a century in widespread use for preparing plates, the two technologies had been bypassed by the transitions to offset printing and to new techniques for the preparation of printing plates.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{stone was}} laid by {{the bishop of}} Marseille, Monseigneur de Mazenod, on September 11, 1853. Work began but {{financial}} problems quickly developed because the foundations had to be laid in very hard rock. In 1855, the government authorized a lottery, but this produced less revenue than anticipated. The financial shortfall grew larger when the sanctuary commission decided to enlarge the crypt to run not only under the choir, but to extend under the entire higher vault. In spite of a loan secured by the personal assets of the bishop, building stopped from 1859 to 1861, the year of Mazenod's death. The new bishop, , arrived {{at the end of}} August in 1861, and resumed work. The generosity of citizens of all religions and all social positions allowed completion of the work, from the Emperor Napoleon III and the Empress Eugénie, who visited Notre Dame de la Garde on September 9, 1860, to the poorest of Marseillais. The sanctuary was dedicated on Saturday June 4, 1864 by the Cardinal of Villecourt, a member of the Roman curia, in the presence of forty-three other bishops. In 1866, mosaic flooring was laid in the upper church and the square bell tower was finished; the bell was installed in October of the same year.In 1867, a cylindrical pedestal or belfry was built on the square bell tower to receive the monumental statue of the virgin. The statue was financed by the town of Marseille. Sketches for the statue made by three Parisian artists, Eugène-Louis Lequesne, Aimé Millet and Charles Gumery were examined by a jury of Espérandieu the architect, , mayor of Marseilles, and Philippe-Auguste Jeanron, director of the School of Fine Arts, , sculptor and professor of sculpture and Luce, president of the Civil Court and administrator of the sanctuary. The committee selected the proposal of Lequesne.For reasons of cost and weight, copper was chosen as the medium for the statue. A very new method for the time was adopted to realize of the statue: galvanoplasty, a type of electroplating, or [...] "the art of moulding without the help of fire" [...] was chosen over hammered copper. A scientific report of November 19, 1866 said that <b>electrotype</b> <b>copper</b> allowed an [...] "irreproachable reproduction" [...] and a solidity that left nothing to be desired. Only Eugène Viollet-le-Duc thought that the galvanoplasty technique would not long resist the atmospheric pollution in Marseilles.|$|R
