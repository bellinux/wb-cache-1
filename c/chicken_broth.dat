40|$|Endo-β- 1, 4 -D-xylanase is a hydrolytic {{enzyme that}} {{breakdown}} the 1. 4 chain of xylan polysaccharide.

The content of N dissolved <b>chicken</b> guts <b>broth</b> reaches 87 % of LB broth. Growth of E.

This optimal condition was used to grow E. coli BL 21 pET-Endo for xylanase production. Enzyme purification was done by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Highest protein yield was 0. 076 mg/mL obtained in 100 mM imidazole elucidation. The activity and specific activity of xylanase were estimated as 0. 042 U/mL and 0. 556 U/µg, respectively.
