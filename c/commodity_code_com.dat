We present different exemplary outcomes of such material flow models of global and European copper flows. Using the <b>commodity</b> <b>codes</b> of trade data analyses for the European copper model as a connection point, we discuss a concept which links the material flow model to multisectoral economic models based on input output tables. The global copper flow model is finally supplemented by market dynamics in order to develop a flexible tool for global market forecasts, taking into account both restrictions of physical raw material supply and different forms of feedback effects on the supply and demand side of the metal market...|$|R

30|$|A {{software}} update payload {{does not have}} to hold a complete program. In the mobile network of the deployment chain, we need {{to take into account the}} different levels of fragmented binary code: (1) diff’ed binary code and (2) packet fragments. Depending on the size of changes from the old version, we first choose either a whole program or a set of fragments of changed parts, called “diff,” to transmit. The diffs are fragments of the binary <b>code</b> <b>com</b> from the different position of the program. The deployment chain then splits the binary object into packets to deliver them through mobile networks. Thus, when we check the integrity of {{software update}}s in the middle of networks, we need to inspect the binary fragments. Fortunately, CodeDog injects the semantics markers in the binary code itself. We can verify control flow semantics without knowledge of the whole program. It is incremental: as we collect more semantics markers, we can verify more control flows. When we have a whole program code, CodeDog can prevent attacks from all the modification of control flows.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurpose of the articlePurpose of {{the present}} article is to {{identify}} drawbacks {{in the field of}} customs statistics of Georgia and to formulate concrete steps for their correction. Methodology/methodsThe methods of induction, deduction, analysis, synthesis, statistical observation and grouping have been used in the research process. The aim of the scientific work is to determine the principles for improving the statistical registration of commodity at the customs in Georgia. ResultsCountries of origin are not yet completely reflected in the cargo-customs declaration at the Georgian customs; the field ``means of transport at the border'' in the cargo-customs declaration is not filled in; data on estimated market value of the means of transport in the databases of Service Agency of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia is not complete; detailed coding of imported vehicles is carried out incorrectly; the simplified customs declarations are not completely filled in with reference to countries, 11 -digit item coding and value. In terms of registration, certain problems are caused by the fact that a sender and a country of final destination are not always filled out in the declaration. Problems exist in producing foreign trade price indices, the issue being that he information on foreign trade statistics is classified according to the Harmonized <b>Commodity</b> Description and <b>Coding</b> System while price indices are calculated according to the classification of types of economic activity on the 4 -digit level; in filling in declarations there are frequent errors related to registration of <b>commodity</b> <b>code,</b> weight and additional units of measurement. ConclusionsEmpirical data related to production of Foreign Trade Statistics are characterized with certain errors, as a part of foreign trade operations remains unregistered.

40|$|This {{appendix}} provides further {{description of}} our data sources, data manipulations and statistical methods. It also tabulates the supplemental data {{used in our}} paper. Data National retail price data. The retail price data were compiled and published by Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Community, {{in cooperation with the}} national statistical agencies of the countries that participated. While all of the price data we utilize is published we are unaware of available electronic copies. All prices refer to cash prices paid by final consumers, including taxes, both VAT and any others paid by the purchaser. Sales points are selected is {{such a way that the}} sample selected is representative of the distribution in the capital city. Prices are collected at different locations so that the average price is representative of the distribution within the city. These data were not available electronically so we had a private firm key-punch the <b>commodity</b> <b>codes,</b> <b>commodity</b> descriptions and prices into an electronic format. Data Reconciliation. In order to explain the price dispersion across goods that exists in our data we constructed measures of tradeability and the costs of non– traded inputs into production. The constructed variables for tradeability, and non– traded inputs from input-output tables are available at different levels of detail. For this reason, and in order to make the most of the information available for each of these factors, we matched the retail price data with each of the variables using two-digit, three-digit, and four-digit classifications depending on the level of detail available for each of the variables rather than attempting to match all variables using the same level of detail. The input-output data are also available at a three-digit level of detail that extends to four-digits for some industry groups. In order to reconcile the data as accurately as possible, we used the ISIC codes and descriptions available in the User Guide of the OECD International Sectoral Database. A description of each of our variables is as follows. • Tradeability. We obtained data on imports, exports, and gross output fo...|$|R

The validation exercise was performed {{in the frame of}} the European Commission co-funded Network of Excellence HySafe (Hydrogen Safety as an Energy Carrier) that has the objective to facilitate the safe introduction of hydrogen technologies. The mitigation effect of vents on the strength of hydrogen explosions is a relevant issue in hydrogen safety. Experiments on stoichiometric hydrogen deflagrations in a 0. 95 m 3 vessel with vents of different size (0. 2 m 2 and 0. 3 m 2) have been selected in the available scientific literature in order to assess the accuracy of computational tools and models in reproducing experimental data in vented explosions.

40|$|Illegal Logging {{is one of}} {{the major}} global causes for {{deforestation}} and the degradation of forests. The further manufacturing of illegally logged wood and products made thereof as well as the associated trade has also negative social and economic effects on both sides of the wood markets, the producer and consumer countries. One of the key measures of the European Union (EU) to combat illegal logging is the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR). The EUTR came into effect on March 1, 2013 and it prohibits the placing of wood and wood products made of illegally logged wood on the EU internal market. This placement can either be done by selling removals from European forests or by importing wood and wood-based products into the EU. But for what kind of products does the regulation apply exactly? The EUTR refers to its An-nex where a list is provided with respective commodities. The products are structured ac-cording to the trade classification of the Combined Nomenclature (CN). The main focus is laid on wood and articles of wood (chapter 44 of the CN), on pulp of wood (chapter 47) and on paper and paperboard and articles made thereof (chapter 48). Additionally <b>commodity</b> <b>codes</b> for furniture and one code for prefabricated buildings are listed.
