40|$|The Earth Observing System Project (EOS) program {{guidelines}} establishes {{significantly more}} stringent requirements on calibrations of instruments. This requirement {{is driven by}} the need for long-term continuity of acquired data sets and the use of measurements in interdisciplinary investigations. Personnel from the Standards and <b>Calibration</b> <b>Office</b> have been supporting the Program and Project in interpreting these goals into specific requirements. Contributions to EOS have included participation in the Panel of Experts which produced a list of consensus items necessary for accomplishing an accurate calibration and suggested EOS Project Calibration Policy, and drafting the announcement of opportunity and bidders information package positions on instrument calibration and data product validation. Technical staffing was provided to the NASA delegates to the Committee on Earth Orbiting Satellites (club of space-faring nations) for the standing working group on Calibration and Data Validation...|$|E
40|$|The Standards and <b>Calibration</b> <b>Office</b> {{maintains}} {{visible and}} near infrared calibration {{sources for the}} use of various GSFC organizations instrument calibration needs and related field activities. These are large aperture spherical and hemispherical integrating sources designed to provide a spatially uniform absolute spectral radiance with a well-defined angular uniformity characteristic. In essence, the calibration and characterization efforts involve monitoring and documenting the stability and the absolute radiance of these calibration sources. These sources are recalibrated on a regular basis to both document any changes that might occur in the output of the sources and to provide the most up-to-date calibration data for the source users. Efforts included comparing the calibration numbers with those of a commercial calibration laboratory that was engaged to do independent calibrations. However, the most recent calibrations done by the independent laboratory and those done by GSFC personnel show a rather large discrepancy (10 to 15 percent). Efforts are underway to resolve these differences...|$|E

40|$|The main {{scope of}} {{statistical}} surveys {{is to determine}} sample estimates. If some auxiliary population totals are available, an inferential step could enlarge precision. Calibration estimators are mostly used by statistical agencies. Since 2005, <b>calibration</b> at Statistical <b>Office</b> of the Slovak Republic has gradually moved from intuitive methods {{to the use of}} sophisticated tools, mainly SAS macro CALMAR 2. The commerce licence, lack of user-friendliness and need for more precise estimates were the important motivations to create own tool Calif, written in the R software. It offers easy-to-use graphical user interface, enhances estimate quality and at last, but not at least, is freely available. It is well suited for each statistical survey and has replaced CALMAR 2 in the process of calibration of weights in the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic.

40|$|Many {{official}} statistics across the UK Government Statistical Service (GSS) are produced using {{data collected from}} sample surveys. These survey data are used to estimate population statistics through weighting and calibration techniques. For surveys with complex or unusual sample designs, the weighting can be fairly complicated. Even in more simple cases, appropriate software is required to implement survey weighting and estimation. As with other stages of the survey process, it is preferable to use a standard, generic calibration tool wherever possible. Standard tools allow for efficient use of resources and assist with the harmonisation of methods. In the case of <b>calibration,</b> the <b>Office</b> for National Statistics (ONS) has experience of using the Statistics Canada Generalized Estimation System (GES) {{across a range of}} business and social surveys. GES is a SAS-based system and so is only available in conjunction with an appropriate SAS licence. Given recent initiatives and encouragement to investigate open source solutions across government, it is appropriate to determine whether there are any open source calibration tools available that can provide the same service as GES. This study compares the use of GES with the calibration tool ‘R evolved Generalized software for sampling estimates and errors in surveys’ (ReGenesees) available in R, an open source statistical programming language which is beginning to be used in many statistical offices. ReGenesees is a free R package which has been developed by the Italian statistics office (Istat) and includes functionality to calibrate survey estimates using similar techniques to GES. This report describes analysis of the performance of ReGenesees in comparison to GES to calibrate a representative selection of ONS surveys. Section 1. 1 provides a brief introduction to the current use of SAS and R in ONS. Section 2 describes GES and ReGenesees in more detail. Sections 3. 1 and 3. 2 consider methods for analysing and comparing the performance of the two tools using case studies from business and social surveys respectively. The analyses cover a range of issues including use with large datasets and complex calibration problems. Section 3. 3 describes more general comparisons between the uses of each tool. The report finishes with a conclusion and recommendations. Annex A provides a glossary of key terms used in this report...|$|R
