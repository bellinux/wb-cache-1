5|$|The deep nuclei of the {{cerebellum}} are {{clusters of}} gray matter lying {{within the white}} matter {{at the core of}} the cerebellum. They are, with the minor exception of the nearby vestibular nuclei, the sole sources of output from the cerebellum. These nuclei receive collateral projections from mossy fibers and climbing fibers as well as inhibitory input from the Purkinje cells of the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex.</b> The four nuclei (dentate, globose, emboliform, and fastigial) each communicate with different parts of the brain and <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex.</b> (The globose and the emboliform nuclei are also referred to as combined in the interposed nucleus). The fastigial and interposed nuclei belong to the spinocerebellum. The dentate nucleus, which in mammals is much larger than the others, is formed as a thin, convoluted layer of gray matter, and communicates exclusively with the lateral parts of the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex.</b> The flocculonodular lobe is the only part of the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex</b> that does not project to the deep nuclei—its output goes to the vestibular nuclei instead.|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, {{the human}} {{cerebellum}} has {{the appearance of}} a separate structure attached {{to the bottom of the}} brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex</b> is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex</b> passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex</b> {{is divided}} into three layers. At the bottom lies the thick {{granular}} layer, densely packed with granule cells, along with interneurons, mainly Golgi cells but also including Lugaro cells and unipolar brush cells. In the middle lies the Purkinje layer, a narrow zone that contains the cell bodies of Purkinje cells and Bergmann glial cells. At the top lies the molecular layer, which contains the flattened dendritic trees of Purkinje cells, along with the huge array of parallel fibers penetrating the Purkinje cell dendritic trees at right angles. This outermost layer of the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex</b> also contains two types of inhibitory interneuron: stellate cells and basket cells. Both stellate and basket cells form GABAergic synapses onto Purkinje cell dendrites.|$|E
50|$|The best {{characterized}} {{and first}} widely accepted function of radial glia is {{their role as}} scaffolds for neuronal migration in the cerebral and <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortexes.</b> This role can be easily visualized using the electron microscope or high-resolution time-lapse microscopy, through which neurons can be seen tightly wrapped around radial glia as they travel upwards through the cortex. Additional evidence suggests that many neurons may move between neighboring radial glial fibers during migration.|$|R
40|$|Personality {{traits are}} multidimensional traits {{comprising}} cognitive, emotional, and behavioral characteristics, {{and a wide}} array of cerebral structures mediate individual variability. Differences in personality traits covary with brain morphometry in specific brain regions, and neuroimaging studies showed structural or functional abnormalities of cerebellum in subjects with personality disorders, suggesting a cerebellar role in affective processing and an effect on personality characteristics. To test the hypothesis that cerebellar [white matter (WM) and cortex] volumes are correlated with scores obtained in the four temperamental scales of the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) by Cloninger, a total of 125 healthy participants aged 18 - 67 years of both genders (males = 52) completed the TCI and underwent magnetic resonance imaging. The scores obtained in each temperamental scale were associated with the volumes of <b>cerebellar</b> WM and <b>cortex</b> of right and left hemispheres separately by using linear regression analyses. In line with our hypothesis, novelty seeking (NS) scores were positively associated with WM and <b>cortex</b> <b>cerebellar</b> volumes. Harm avoidance (HA) scores were negatively associated with WM and <b>cortex</b> <b>cerebellar</b> volumes. The range of individual differences in NS and HA scores reflects the range of variances of cerebellar volumes. The present data indicating a cerebellar substrate for some personality traits extend the relationship between personality and brain areas to a structure up to now thought to be involved mainly in motor and cognitive functions, much less in emotional processes and even less in personality individual difference...|$|R
50|$|Current {{understanding}} of the localization of OR in the brain is still unclear. In one study using fMRI and SCR, researchers found novel visual stimuli associated with SCR responses typical of an OR also corresponded to activation in the hippocampus, anterior cingulate gyrus, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These regions are also believed to be largely responsible for emotion, decision making, and memory. Increases in <b>cerebellar</b> and extrastriate <b>cortex</b> were also recorded, which are significantly implicated in visual perception and processing.|$|R
5|$|The unusual surface {{appearance}} of the cerebellum conceals {{the fact that most}} of its volume is made up of a very tightly folded layer of gray matter: the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex.</b> Each ridge or gyrus in this layer is called a folium. It is estimated that, if the human <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex</b> were completely unfolded, it would give rise to a layer of neural tissue about 1meter long and averaging 5centimeters wide—a total surface area of about 500square cm, packed within a volume of dimensions 6cm × 5cm × 10cm. Underneath the gray matter of the cortex lies white matter, made up largely of myelinated nerve fibers running to and from the cortex. Embedded within the white matter—which is sometimes called the arbor vitae (tree of life) because of its branched, tree-like appearance in cross-section—are four deep cerebellar nuclei, composed of gray matter.|$|E
5|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of gross anatomy, the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex</b> {{appears to be a}} homogeneous sheet of tissue, and, from {{the viewpoint}} of microanatomy, all parts of this sheet appear to have the same internal structure. There are, however, a number of respects in which the structure of the cerebellum is compartmentalized. There are large compartments that are generally known as zones; these can be divided into smaller compartments known as microzones.|$|E
5|$|Neuroanatomists usually {{divide the}} {{vertebrate}} brain into six main regions: the telencephalon (cerebral hemispheres), diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus), mesencephalon (midbrain), cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata. Each {{of these areas}} has a complex internal structure. Some parts, such as the cerebral cortex and the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex,</b> consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space. Other parts, such as the thalamus and hypothalamus, consist of clusters of many small nuclei. Thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within the vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity.|$|E

40|$|Although {{there has}} been {{extensive}} research {{on the effect of}} IGF-I on muscles and bone tissue, the effect on brain aging has received little attention. We investigated the IGF-I content in brains of differently aged rats. The IGF-I contents in <b>cerebellar</b> and cerebral <b>cortex</b> were found to be higher in immature rats (4 - 5 days old) compared to young adult (2. 5 months old) and middle-aged (7. 5 - 9 months old) rats. However, the decrease of mean IGF-I in middle-aged rats compared to immature animals was statistically significant only in the cerebellar codex. Our results indicate that IGF-I content decreases through the lifespan and maybe selectively in some brain regions...|$|R
5|$|Cerebellar granule cells, in {{contrast}} to Purkinje cells, are among the smallest neurons in the brain. They are also easily the most numerous neurons in the brain: In humans, estimates of their total number average around 50 billion, which means that about 3/4 of the brain's neurons are cerebellar granule cells. Their cell bodies are packed into a thick layer {{at the bottom of}} the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex.</b> A granule cell emits only four to five dendrites, each of which ends in an enlargement called a dendritic claw. These enlargements are sites of excitatory input from mossy fibers and inhibitory input from Golgi cells.|$|E
5|$|Modularity: The {{cerebellar}} {{system is}} functionally divided into {{more or less}} independent modules, which probably number in the hundreds to thousands. All modules have a similar internal structure, but different inputs and outputs. A module (a multizonal microcompartment in the terminology of Apps and Garwicz) consists of a small cluster of neurons in the inferior olivary nucleus, a set of long narrow strips of Purkinje cells in the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex</b> (microzones), and a small cluster of neurons {{in one of the}} deep cerebellar nuclei. Different modules share input from mossy fibers and parallel fibers, but in other respects they appear to function independently—the output of one module does not appear to significantly influence the activity of other modules.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebellum}} of cartilaginous and {{bony fishes}} is extraordinarily large and complex. In {{at least one}} important respect, it differs in internal structure from the mammalian cerebellum: The fish cerebellum does not contain discrete deep cerebellar nuclei. Instead, the primary targets of Purkinje cells are a distinct type of cell distributed across the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex,</b> a type not seen in mammals. In mormyrid fish (a family of weakly electrosensitive freshwater fish), the cerebellum is considerably larger {{than the rest of}} the brain put together. The largest part of it is a special structure called the valvula, which has an unusually regular architecture and receives much of its input from the electrosensory system.|$|E
50|$|In 1998 a {{research}} team used MRI evidence {{to determine the}} differences in <b>cerebellar</b> and tempero-parietal <b>cortex</b> brain activity using a group of 14 dyslexic men and 15 additional men on a control group. They found biochemical differences in these parts of the brains of the dyslexic men from a normally functioning brain. Specifically {{when it comes to}} the balance between chlorine-containing compounds and N-acetylaspartate in the brains of individuals who have dyslexia. They hypothesized that this imbalance may result in abnormal cell formation in the brain, thus potentially leading to dyslexia. The study also mentioned the aid that anti-motion sickness medication can give to helping dyslexic people cope with their disorder, referring to them as cerebellar-vestibular stabilizing.|$|R
40|$|Human {{fetal tissue}} {{fragments}} from cortex cerebri and cerebellum were grafted to the anterior {{chamber of the}} eye of adult athymic nude rats. The grafts were obtained from tissue fragments recovered after elective routine abortions, performed in weeks 8 - 11 of gestation. Both <b>cerebellar</b> and <b>cortex</b> cerebri grafts survived and developed in the anterior chamber of the eye for 1 - 4 months. The transplants slowly became vascularized from the host iris. The grafts developed blood vessels with laminin-immunoreactive walls and contained relatively high amounts of glial fibrillary acidic protein- and neurofilament-immunoreactivity in the neuropil after 4 months in oculo. Recordings of extracellular action potentials from the grafts revealed spontaneously active neurons with action-potential waveforms similar to those observed in immature rodents. Morphologically, the grafts {{showed no signs of}} rejection. Clusters and bands of large neurons resembling Purkinje cells and dense aggregates of smaller granule-like cells could be found in the cerebellar grafts. Large neurons were also seen in the cortex grafts. Taken together, these data suggest that the athymic rat may serve as a useful tool for studies of central nervous system tissue from otherwise immunologically incompatible species...|$|R
40|$|Benzodiazepine {{potentiation}} of g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neu-rotransmission {{is associated}} with the presence of a gamma- 2 subunit in the GABAA receptor. A method was developed to modify the gamma- 2 subunit expression in adult rat brain. Unilat-eral intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) infusion of a 17 -base phospho-rothioate-modified antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ASO) was performed every 12 hr for 3 days. Controls were treated with a sense oligodeoxynucleotide. Parasagittal brain sections were used for quantitative autoradiographic analysis of radioligand binding. ASO treatment caused a 15 % to 25 % decrease of spe-cific [3 H]flunitrazepam binding in most brain areas, with statisti-cally significant decreases in frontal <b>cortex,</b> <b>cerebellar</b> molecular layer, zona reticulata of substantia nigra and CA 3 of hippocam-pus.

5|$|Prior to the 1990s the {{function}} of the cerebellum was almost universally believed to be purely motor-related, but newer findings have brought that view into question. Functional imaging studies have shown cerebellar activation in relation to language, attention, and mental imagery; correlation studies have shown interactions between the cerebellum and non-motor areas of the cerebral cortex; and a variety of non-motor symptoms have been recognized in people with damage that appears to be confined to the cerebellum. In particular, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome or Schmahmann's syndrome has been described in adults and children. Estimates based on functional mapping of the cerebellum using functional MRI suggest {{that more than half of}} the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex</b> is interconnected with association zones of the cerebral cortex.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied cerebellar learning tasks is the eyeblink conditioning paradigm, in which a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) such as a tone or a light is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), such as an air puff, that elicits a blink response. After such repeated presentations of the CS and US, the CS will eventually elicit a blink before the US, a conditioned response or CR. Experiments showed that lesions localized either to a specific part of the interposed nucleus (one of the deep cerebellar nuclei) or to a few specific points in the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex</b> would abolish learning of a conditionally timed blink response. If cerebellar outputs are pharmacologically inactivated while leaving the inputs and intracellular circuits intact, learning takes place even while the animal fails to show any response, whereas, if intracerebellar circuits are disrupted, no learning takes place—these facts taken together make a strong case that the learning, indeed, occurs inside the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|Purkinje {{cells are}} among the most {{distinctive}} neurons in the brain, and one of the earliest types to be recognized—they were first described by the Czech anatomist Jan Evangelista Purkyně in 1837. They are distinguished by the shape of their dendritic tree: The dendrites branch very profusely, but are severely flattened in a plane perpendicular to the cerebellar folds. Thus, the dendrites of a Purkinje cell form a dense planar net, through which parallel fibers pass at right angles. The dendrites are covered with dendritic spines, each of which receives synaptic input from a parallel fiber. Purkinje cells receive more synaptic inputs than any other type of cell in the brain—estimates of the number of spines on a single human Purkinje cell run as high as 200,000. The large, spherical cell bodies of Purkinje cells are packed into a narrow layer (one cell thick) of the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex,</b> called the Purkinje layer. After emitting collaterals that affect nearby parts of the cortex, their axons travel into the deep cerebellar nuclei, where they make on the order of 1,000 contacts each with several types of nuclear cells, all within a small domain. Purkinje cells use GABA as their neurotransmitter, and therefore exert inhibitory effects on their targets.|$|E

40|$|The precise {{distribution}} of {{thyrotropin releasing hormone}} (TRH) in 23 discrete brain nuclei and areas of Wistar strain male rats was determined by specific radioimmunoassay. TRH was detected {{in most of these}} areas. The highest concentration was found in the median eminence (27. 52 +/- 2. 84 ng/mg protein). The arcuate nucleus (4. 92 +/- 0. 58 ng/mg protein), dorsomedial nucleus (4. 77 +/- 0. 59 ng/mg protein) and medial preoptic area (3. 94 +/- 0. 15 ng/mg protein) also contained a considerable concentration of TRH. However, no TRH was detected in cerebral <b>cortex,</b> <b>cerebellar</b> hemisphere, anterior pituitary or pineal body. The data indicated that TRH was widely distributed throughout the hypothalamus; in particular, high concentrations occure in relatively restricted areas: in the median eminence, arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and medial preoptic area.

The circuits in the cerebellum are similar across all classes of vertebrates, including fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals.

500|$|The first {{indications}} of compartmental structure came {{from studies of}} the receptive fields of cells {{in various parts of}} the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex.</b> Each body part maps to specific points in the cerebellum, but there are numerous repetitions of the basic map, forming an arrangement that has been called [...] "fractured somatotopy". A clearer indication of compartmentalization is obtained by immunostaining the cerebellum for certain types of protein. The best-known of these markers are called [...] "zebrins", because staining for them gives rise to a complex pattern reminiscent of the stripes on a zebra. The stripes generated by zebrins and other compartmentalization markers are oriented perpendicular to the cerebellar folds—that is, they are narrow in the mediolateral direction, but much more extended in the longitudinal direction. Different markers generate different sets of stripes, the widths and lengths vary as a function of location, but they all have the same general shape.|$|E
500|$|Purkinje cells {{also receive}} {{input from the}} {{inferior}} olivary nucleus on the contralateral side of the brainstem via climbing fibers. Although the inferior olive lies in the medulla oblongata and receives input from the spinal cord, brainstem and cerebral cortex, its output goes entirely to the cerebellum. A climbing fiber gives off collaterals to the deep cerebellar nuclei before entering the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>cortex,</b> where it splits into about 10 terminal branches, each of which gives input to a single Purkinje cell. In striking contrast to the 100,000-plus inputs from parallel fibers, each Purkinje cell receives input from exactly one climbing fiber; but this single fiber [...] "climbs" [...] the dendrites of the Purkinje cell, winding around them and making a total of up to 300 synapses as it goes. The net input {{is so strong that}} a single action potential from a climbing fiber is capable of producing an extended complex spike in the Purkinje cell: a burst of several spikes in a row, with diminishing amplitude, followed by a pause during which activity is suppressed. The climbing fiber synapses cover the cell body and proximal dendrites; this zone is devoid of parallel fiber inputs.|$|E
40|$|Changes in neuroplasticity and {{neuronal}} adaptative mechanisms {{have been}} postulated as origin and/or main pathophysiological factor in neurodegenerative diseases. To analyze these theories, a comparative morphohistochemical {{study on the}} cerebral (prefrontal) and <b>cerebellar</b> (neocerebellar) <b>cortex</b> from Alzheimer's (AD) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD) post-mortem brains has been carried out. Variations in putative markers of neuroplasticity and neuronal adaptation (synaptic proteins such as drebrin and SNAP- 25; nuclear factor NF kappa Beta -NFkB-; neuronal isoform of oxide nitric synthase -nNOS) have been studied in close association with neuropathological markers (beta-protein deposition - amyloid in AD and PrPsc in CJD-; microglial activation, induction of iNOS and cyclooxygenase 2 -COX- 2). Results have shown sharp variations in these markers when compared AD and CJD; cerebral and cerebellar cortex; different areas of these anatomical regions; and different sets of neurons and glial cells. The meaining of somme of these markers (NFkB; nNOS; synaptic proteins) could be variable (plastic/adaptative or involutive), depending on different factors (disease, anatomical region, general or local factors, etc.). Neuroplasticity is evident in several brain regions or neurons, but this neuronal feature decreases in different form depending also on the disease and the anatomical region. Their relationships to the neuropathological findings were also variable. In conclusion, the activation of these putative markers of neuroplasticity, considering as therapeutical targets, in advanced steps of the diseases, could activate neuronal involutive phenomena in several regions or neurons.

Fungal material can be detected both intra- and extracellularly using specific antibodies against several fungi. Different brain regions including external frontal <b>cortex,</b> <b>cerebellar</b> hemisphere, entorhinal cortex/hippocampus and choroid plexus contain fungal material, which is absent in brain tissue from control individuals.

These findings were not present with similar modulation of visual cortex excitability. In contrast, tDCS over M 1 did not affect adaptation, but resulted in a marked increase in retention of the newly learnt visuomotor transformation.

[18 F]FDG PET scanning was performed twice on each subject: once after the spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) intervention (treatment condition) and once after resting (control condition). We performed the SMT intervention using an adjustment device. Glucose metabolism of the brain and skeletal muscles was measured and compared between the two conditions.
