5|$|The HPOTP turbine and HPOTP {{pumps are}} {{mounted on a}} <b>common</b> <b>shaft.</b> Mixing of the fuel-rich hot gases in the turbine section and the liquid oxygen in the main pump can create a hazard and, to prevent this, the two {{sections}} are separated by a cavity that is continuously purged by the engine's helium supply during engine operation. Two seals minimize leakage into the cavity; one seal is located between the turbine section and the cavity, while the other is between the pump section and cavity. Loss of helium pressure in this cavity results in automatic engine shutdown.|$|E
25|$|The vibraphone {{resembles the}} xylophone, marimba, and glockenspiel. Each bar is {{paired with a}} {{resonator}} tube that has a motor-driven butterfly valve at its upper end. The valves are mounted on a <b>common</b> <b>shaft,</b> which produces a tremolo or vibrato effect while spinning. The vibraphone also has a sustain pedal similar to that on a piano. With the pedal up, the bars are all damped and produce a shortened sound. With the pedal down, they sound for several seconds.|$|E
25|$|The Gull was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane, {{constructed of}} wood with fabric covering. The wings reduced outwards in both thickness and chord, with dihedral outboard of the centre section. They were constructed according to Basil Henderson's patent, and folded rearwards {{at the rear}} spar for storage. There were split flaps inboard. The fin and rudder were initially {{very similar to those}} of the Hendy 302, with a horn balance and a notable nick on the leading edge where that balance met the fin, but this was soon replaced by the final symmetric, elliptical and unbalanced arrangement. The horizontal surfaces were also rounded, and tail plane incidence was adjustable in flight for trim; the elevators were mounted on a <b>common</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
50|$|An early {{innovation}} was {{the installation}} of their own electricity generating station, completed in 1894. This allowed machine tools to be electrically driven rather than the traditional <b>common</b> <b>shafts</b> driven by steam. This development was to prove profitable in other ways, as the company was able to provide similar generator stations for both public supplies and industrial applications e.g. tramways, {{as one of its}} range of products.|$|R

25|$|The Solar Challenger was {{designed}} to be sturdier, more powerful, and more maneuverable than the Gossamer Penguin so as to be able to withstand sustained high-altitude flight and normal turbulence. It was over three times as heavy (without pilot) as the Gossamer Penguin and had a shorter wingspan, but was proportionately more powerful, with electricity supplied by 16,128 solar cells powering two three-horsepower motors. The solar panels were directly affixed to the wing and large horizontal stabilizer, both of which had to be flat on top to accommodate them. The two motors, each 3inches wide and 17inches long and incorporating samarium-cobalt permanent magnets, operated in tandem on a <b>common</b> <b>shaft</b> to drive a single, controllable-pitch propeller. The design incorporated advanced synthetic materials with very high strength to weight ratios, including Kevlar, Nomex, Delrin, Teflon, and Mylar, all supplied by the aircraft's sponsor, Dupont.|$|E
500|$|The HPOTP {{consists}} of two single-stage centrifugal pumps (a main pump and a preburner pump) mounted on a <b>common</b> <b>shaft</b> and driven by a two-stage, hot-gas turbine. The main pump boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from [...] while operating at approximately 28,120rpm, giving a power output of [...] The HPOTP discharge flow splits into several paths, one of which drives the LPOTP turbine. Another path is to, and through, the main oxidizer valve and enters the main combustion chamber. Another small flow path is tapped off {{and sent to the}} oxidizer heat exchanger. The liquid oxygen flows through an anti-flood valve that prevents it from entering the heat exchanger until sufficient heat is present for the heat exchanger to utilize the heat contained in the gases discharged from the HPOTP turbine, converting the liquid oxygen to gas. The gas is sent to a manifold and then routed to pressurize the liquid oxygen tank. Another path enters the HPOTP second-stage preburner pump to boost the liquid oxygen's pressure from 30 to 51 MPa (4,300 psia to 7,400 psia). It passes through the oxidizer preburner oxidizer valve into the oxidizer preburner, and through the fuel preburner oxidizer valve into the fuel preburner. The HPOTP measures approximately [...] It is attached by flanges to the hot-gas manifold.|$|E
2500|$|The turbine {{generator}} {{consists of a}} series of steam turbines interconnected to each other and a generator on a <b>common</b> <b>shaft.</b> There is usually a high-pressure turbine at one end, followed by an intermediate-pressure turbine, and finally one, two, or three low-pressure turbines, and the generator. As steam moves through the system and loses pressure and thermal energy, it expands in volume, requiring increasing diameter and longer blades at each succeeding stage to extract the remaining energy. The entire rotating mass may be over 200 metric tons and [...] long. It is so heavy that it must be kept turning slowly even when shut down (at 3 rpm) so that the shaft will not bow even slightly and become unbalanced. This is so important that it is one of only six functions of blackout emergency power batteries on site. [...] (The other five being emergency lighting, communication, station alarms, generator hydrogen seal system, and turbogenerator lube oil.) ...|$|E

40|$|Methods were {{evaluated}} for assessing axial compressive capacities of augered, cast-in-place (ACIP) piles in the Pleistocene terrace deposits of the Texas Gulf Coast and Recent to Modern alluvial soils. The study involved {{a combination of}} data base analyses {{and the performance of}} new loading tests on instrumented piles. The results in sand deposits mirrored earlier studies that indicated that common methods used for designing drilled shafts are also appropriate for ACIP piles, although the patterns of load transfer in the tested piles suggested zones of both lower load transfer (running sands below the water table) and higher load transfer (compacted surface soils) than would be expected in drilled shafts. The action of drilling and grouting resulted in net increases in lateral effective stresses in the soil around the tested piles, near the ground surface, where such measurements were made. In overconsolidated clays, slightly higher unit side resistances were inferred for ACIP piles than are predicted by <b>common</b> drilled <b>shaft</b> design methods. However, <b>common</b> drilled <b>shaft</b> design methods, notably the FHWA method, produced generally accurate capacities for mixed soil profiles...|$|R

50|$|In 1937, at {{the behest}} of the United States Army Air Corps, the Allison Engine Company agreed to design and build a large-displacement {{high-power}} aircraft engine. The resulting V-3420 was essentially a pair of 12-cylinder Allison V-1710 engines mated to a common crankcase with a 30° angle between the inner cylinder banks. The crankshafts of the two V-1710 engines were geared together to drive a <b>common</b> propeller <b>shaft.</b> Most V-3420 parts were interchangeable with those for V-1710-E and -F engines.|$|R
50|$|It was {{apparent}} that the O-1230 engine was uncompetitive with the high-performance air-cooled engines that were then becoming available. The US Navy began funding {{the development of the}} Lycoming engine. The funding enabled Lycoming's engineers to attempt rescuing the design by proposing a 24-cylinder H-configuration engine made by stacking two of the O-1230 engines, gearing them together to one <b>common</b> output <b>shaft.</b> The new engine was the H-2470. It weighed in at 2,430 pounds and produced 2,300 hp (1,700 kW) at 3,300 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|The M-1 {{used the}} gas-generator cycle, burning {{some of its}} liquid {{hydrogen}} and oxygen in a small combustor to provide hot gases for running the fuel pumps. In {{the case of the}} M-1, the hydrogen and oxygen turbopumps were completely separate, each using their own turbine, rather than running both off a <b>common</b> power <b>shaft.</b> The hydrogen and oxygen pumps were some of the most powerful ever built at the time, producing 75,000 horsepower for the former, and [...] for the latter.|$|R
