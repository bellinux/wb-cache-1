500|$|... "There's Something About Marrying" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} J. Stewart Burns and directed by Nancy Kruse {{as part of the}} sixteenth season of The Simpsons. Work on the episode started in March 2004, after the 2004 San Francisco same-sex weddings, a period during February 2004 when the city was issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. This served as the Simpsons staff's inspiration for [...] "There's Something About Marrying". The plot point where Springfield tries to increase tourism by marketing towards the LGBT community also had a basis in reality. An example is Fort Lauderdale, which became a popular tourist destination for gays and lesbians in the mid-2000s. Executive producer Al Jean said they were interested in doing the episode because they could explore the various characters' different positions on gay marriage while remaining neutral. [...] "Lisa thinks it's good for civil rights. The reverend of the local Protestant church is opposed to it. Other people think tourists will <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>town.</b> Mayor Quimby wants the money. We don't take a position as much as explore everybody's positions," [...] he commented.|$|E

Of Dylan's storyline and involvement in the love triangle, Phelps said: [...] "Dylan does <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>town</b> to find Avery but this story has much more complexity than that [...] What {{you think is going to}} happen is not what's going to happen."
