5|$|Moe hands Veronica a drink. Immediately after {{discovering}} {{a picture of}} Mercer and Moe, Veronica experiences {{the effects of a}} date rape drug. She hides in the closet and struggles to remain conscious. Mercer and Moe enter the room and are about to miss her, but Veronica’s cell phone rings and they knock her out. Parker (Julie Gonzalo) <b>calls</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Mercer. In addition to a bomb threat against Hearst, Dean O’Dell notices his window being egged before a mysterious man enters and the Dean asks “What are you doing here?” Keith arrests Mercer and Moe. Logan intentionally gets himself arrested so he can go into the cell with Mercer and Moe.|$|E
5|$|Not My Life <b>calls</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> {{the fact}} that, in the United States, the {{sentencing}} for human trafficking is less severe than for drug trafficking. The film indicates {{a relationship between}} contemporary slavery and globalization. It asserts that most human trafficking victims are children, although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts human trafficking {{as a matter of}} good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking. Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues.|$|E

5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, {{said that the}} play was about the human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama <b>calls</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the fact that poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E
25|$|Erin McCarthy of Popular Mechanics <b>calls</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the film's {{confusion}} of numerology, the occult's {{study of how}} numbers like dates of birth influence human affairs, with the ability of science to describe the world mathematically to make predictions about things like weather or create technology like cell phones.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{descriptions}} of Yoshiaki Omura, Brazilian psychic surgery appears {{to be different from}} that practiced in the Philippines. Omura <b>calls</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the fact that practitioners in Brazil use techniques resembling Qigong, Shiatsu massage, and chiropractic manipulation. Some patients are also injected with a brown liquid, and alleged minor surgery was performed in about 20% of the cases observed. While Arigó performed his procedures using kitchen knives in improvised settings, Omura reports that the clamping of blood vessels and the closing of the surgical wounds are now performed by licensed surgeons or licensed nurses.|$|E

25|$|Emphasis and {{contrast}} may override normal stress. Pronouns frequently take stress because of this. In {{a simple question}} like Ĉu vi vídis? ('Did you see?'), the pronoun hardly {{needs to be said}} and is unstressed; compare Né, dónu al mí and ('No, give me). Within a word, a prefix that wasn't heard correctly may be stressed upon repetition: Né, ne tíen! Iru máldekstren, mi diris! ('No, not over there! Go left, I said!'). Because stress doesn't distinguish words in Esperanto, shifting it to an unexpected syllable <b>calls</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> that syllable, but doesn't cause confusion as it might in English.|$|E
25|$|The only {{fact that}} can be adduced {{in support of the}} {{assertion}} that Grimm wished to deprive Rask of his claims to priority is that he does not expressly mention Rask's results in his second edition. But {{it was part of the}} plan of his work to refrain from all controversy or reference to the works of others. In his first edition, he expressly <b>calls</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Rask's essay, and praises it ungrudgingly. It is true that a certain bitterness of feeling afterwards sprang up between Grimm and Rask, but this may have well been Rask's fault, who, impatient of contradiction and irritable in controversy, refused to consider the value of Grimm's views when they called for the modification of his own.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critical}} scholars {{oppose the}} view that the sacred texts, including the Hebrew Bible, were divinely inspired. Many of these scholars accept the general principles of the documentary hypothesis and suggest that the Torah consists of inconsistent texts edited together in a way that <b>calls</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> divergent accounts. Many suggest that during the First Temple period, the people of Israel believed that each nation had its own god, but that their god was superior to other gods. Some suggest that strict monotheism developed during the Babylonian Exile, perhaps in reaction to Zoroastrian dualism. In this view, it was only by the Hellenic period that most Jews came to believe that their god was the only god and that the notion of a clearly bounded Jewish nation identical with the Jewish religion formed.|$|E

500|$|The plan {{behind the}} scenes was to create an {{intriguing}} visual signature. [...] To serve the subtleties of the script and to help personify death, production designer John Willet developed the concept of [...] "skewing" [...] the sets. [...] "What I've tried {{to do with the}} sets themselves, with their design and with various color choices, is to make things just a little unnatural," [...] Willet explained. [...] "Nothing that <b>calls</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> itself, but instead creates a sense of uneasiness—the unsettling feeling that something's not quite right". [...] To achieve this mystique, Willet designed two versions of virtually every set—one version was used before the crash and the other sets were used for scenes after the jet explodes.|$|E
5000|$|Although less {{significant}} {{in terms of}} public policy, proclamations are also used ceremonially by presidents to honor a group or situation or <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> certain issues or events.

500|$|Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle lauded {{the film}} for {{containing}} {{a sense of}} urgency [...] "that keeps the pedestrian problems of an unremarkable 18th century family immediate and personal." [...] LaSalle concluded that the adaptation has a [...] "right balance of irony and warmth. The result is a film of great understanding and emotional clarity, filmed with an elegance that never <b>calls</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> itself." [...] Film critic John Simon praised most of the film, particularly focusing on Thompson's performance, though he criticised Grant for being [...] "much too adorably bumbling... he urgently needs to chasten his onscreen persona, and stop hunching his shoulders like a dromedary." [...] However, many other major critics such as LaSalle, Roger Ebert, James Berardinelli and Janet Maslin praised Grant's performance. Maslin wrote, Grant [...] "rises touchingly to the film's most straightforward and meaningful encounters." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an article}} for Complex, Debbie Encalada praised the SpongeBob series for {{challenging}} social norms; the portrayal of the Krabses as a single-parent family was specifically highlighted {{as an example of}} the show's [...] "subversiveness by subtly challenging the idea of the nuclear family". Psychologist Steve Harriman covers the Krabs family dynamic in the 2005 Berkley Book Absorbing SpongeBob. He <b>calls</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the lack of explanation for the disparity between Pearl and Mr. Krabs' species, noting that it is only after watching several episodes that viewers realize the Krabs family is broken. He also questions the decision to focus on Patrick's family not Pearl's in the only episode dealing [...] "head-on with a core pathology of family""I'm with Stupid". In his review of the third season, Bryan Pope of DVD Verdict called Mr. Krabs and Pearl (as well as Krabs' girlfriend Mrs. Puff, whom he mistook for the character's wife) one of [...] "the most head-scratching family units [...] ever come across".|$|E
500|$|In {{their book}} The Simpsons and philosophy: the d'oh! of Homer, William Irwin, Mark T. Conard and [...] Aeon J. Skoble wrote that [...] "They Saved Lisa's Brain" [...] in detail explores [...] "the {{possibility}} of a utopian alternative to politics as usual in Springfield". They described [...] "They Saved Lisa's Brain" [...] as an [...] "epitome" [...] of The Simpsons diverse comedic humor, and wrote {{that it can be}} [...] "enjoyed in two levels", as both [...] "broad farce" [...] and [...] "intellectual satire". As an example of the episode's farcical humor, they referred to the episode's subplot, which, they wrote, [...] "contains some of the grossest humor in the long history of The Simpsons." [...] At the same time, the episode is [...] "filled" [...] with what they described as [...] "subtle cultural allusions", such as the design of Mensa group's locale, which is based on American architect Frank Lloyd Wright's house. Likewise, Lisa's challenge to Springfield <b>calls</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> the [...] "cultural limitations of small-town America", while the episode also argues that intellectual disdain for the common man can be carried too far and that theory can [...] "all too easily lose touch with common sense". They also argued that the episode, as well as the series as a whole, offers a kind of intellectual defense of the common man against intellectuals, which they opined [...] "helps explain its popularity and broad appeal [...] defends the common man against the intellectual, in a way that both the common man and the intellectual can understand and enjoy." ...|$|E
