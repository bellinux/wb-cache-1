30|$|The {{design of}} <b>bit</b> <b>crown</b> is an {{important}} part of polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit design, although predecessors have done a lot of researches on the design principles of PDC <b>bit</b> <b>crown,</b> the study of the law about rock-breaking energy consumption according to different <b>bit</b> <b>crown</b> shape is not very systematic, and the mathematical model of design is over-simplified. In order to analyze the relation between rock-breaking energy consumption and <b>bit</b> <b>crown</b> shape quantificationally, the paper puts forward an idea to take “per revolution-specific rock-breaking work” as objective function, and analyzes the relationship between rock properties, inner cone angle, outer cone arc radius, and per revolution-specific rock-breaking work by means of explicit dynamic finite element method. Results show that the change law between per revolution-specific rock-breaking work and the radius of gyration is similar for rocks with different properties, it is beneficial to decrease rock-breaking energy consumption by decreasing inner cone angle or outer cone arc radius. Of course, we should also consider hydraulic structure and processing technology in the optimization design of PDC <b>bit</b> <b>crown.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} newer {{application}} {{techniques such as}} ombré, in which hair is dark on the <b>crown</b> and <b>bit</b> by bit becomes lighter toward the ends, and splashlights, in which a horizontal band of bleached hair stretches from ear to ear.|$|R
30|$|Generally, PDC <b>bit’s</b> <b>crown</b> shape {{consists}} of inner cone, cone apex, and outer cone. Inner cone takes {{effect on the}} stability and guiding of the bit; cone apex is the part which penetrates into the formation first, {{the design of the}} structure is related to the formation characteristics, the length of outer cone is determined by cutter density, and the outer cone affects the wear of the bit (Kerr 1988; Cerkovnik 1982). This paper analyzes the relation of inner cone angle and outer cone arc radius to per revolution-specific rock-breaking work, and lays the foundation for the optimization design of PDC drill <b>bit’s</b> <b>crown</b> shape.|$|R
30|$|The crown {{shape of}} {{polycrystalline}} diamond compact (PDC) drill bit affects the stability, wear, bottom hole cleaning, and load {{distribution of the}} bit. Predecessors {{have done a lot}} of researches about the design of PDC <b>bit</b> <b>crown,</b> and proposed some design principles, such as equivolume, equal abrasion, and equipower (Shusheng et al. 1998; Rong et al. 2006; Zhigang and Gang 1994; Hibbs and Flom 1978; Glowka D 1985; Sinor et al. 1998). But they just got the conclusion that “the axial force and cutting force of the topper cutter is bigger than the both sides cutters” qualitatively (Han Laiju et al. 1992), and did not give the quantitative analysis. The wear of the cutters is mainly caused by the rock-breaking force and specific energy consumption, and the force that applied on the cutters in the different parts of the crown is different, so it is necessary to study the mechanical characteristic of cutters in different parts of the crown, and this research will has an important guiding significance in the optimization design of PDC drill bit’s cutting structure. This paper takes “per revolution-specific rock-breaking work” as objective function, evaluates the rock-breaking effect of different crown shapes, and provides the theoretical basis for the optimization design of PDC drill <b>bit’s</b> <b>crown</b> shape.|$|R
30|$|The {{parameter}} a (per revolution-specific rock-breaking work) reflects that, {{under the}} conditions of certain rock property, drilling technology, and drilling rate, the work that the cutter requires to break per volume of rock in any position of the crown. Per revolution-specific rock-breaking work in any position of the crown acquired from finite element method is basically consistent with the wear law of PDC drill <b>bit’s</b> <b>crown,</b> this shows that {{it is reasonable to}} design the crown shape of PDC drill bit optimally based on the objective function of per revolution-specific rock-breaking work.|$|R
30|$|Formula  4 can {{reflect the}} work that {{required}} to break per unit volume of rock in any position of the crown. The physical meaning of formula  4 reflects {{the work that}} the cutter requires to break per unit volume of rock in any position of the crown in the conditions of certain rock property, drilling technology, and drilling rate. The smaller of a, the less the rock-breaking specific energy consumption, {{and at the same}} time the rock-breaking efficiency will be higher. So, the parameter a can be used as the objective function for optimal design of PDC drill <b>bit’s</b> <b>crown</b> shape.|$|R
30|$|The {{optimization}} {{design of}} the drill <b>bit’s</b> <b>crown</b> shape is not only related to the cutting structure, but also {{closely related to the}} hydraulic structure and processing technology. For the soft formation, whether the channel is unobstructed should be considered firstly. Then in this case, a larger value of the outer cone arc radius and a smaller value of the inner cone angel are suggested to choose. As for the hard formation, the wear of the cutters should be considered. So, a smaller value of the outer cone arc radius and a larger value of the inner cone angel are suggested to choose {{in order to reduce the}} rock-breaking energy consumption in the cone apex area.|$|R
60|$|The first view of {{the ruins}} in the Forum brought {{a keen sense of}} disappointment. I knew that they could only be mere {{fragments}} and rubbish, but I was not prepared to find them so. I learned that I had all along secretly hoped for some dignity of neighborhood, some affectionate solicitude on the part of Nature to redeem these works of Art from the destruction that had befallen them. But in hollows below the level of the dirty cowfield, wandered over by evil-eyed buffaloes, and obscenely defiled by wild beasts of men, there stood here an arch, there a pillar, yonder a cluster of columns <b>crowned</b> by a <b>bit</b> of frieze; and yonder again, a fragment of temple, half-gorged by the façade of a hideous Renaissance church; then a height of vaulted brick-work, and, leading on to the Coliseum, another arch, and then incoherent columns overthrown and mixed with dilapidated walls--mere phonographic consonants, dumbly representing the past, out of which all vocal glory had departed. The Coliseum itself does not much better express a certain phase of Roman life than does the Arena at Verona; it is larger only to the foot-rule, and it seemed not grander otherwise, while it is vastly more ruinous. Even the Pantheon failed to impress me at first sight, though I found myself disposed to return to it again and again, and to be more and more affected by it.|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} half-past three when I came {{forth on the}} Lang Dykes. Dean was where I wanted to go. Since Catriona dwelled there, and her kinsfolk the Glengyle Macgregors {{appeared}} almost certainly to be employed against me, {{it was just one}} of the few places I should have kept away from; and being a very young man, and beginning to be very much in love, I turned my face in that direction without pause. As a salve to my conscience and common sense, however, I took a measure of precaution. Coming over the <b>crown</b> of a <b>bit</b> of a rise in the road, I clapped down suddenly among the barley and lay waiting. After a while, a man went by that looked to be a Highlandman, but I had never seen him till that hour. Presently after came Neil of the red head. The next to go past was a miller's cart, and after that nothing but manifest country people. Here was enough to have turned the most foolhardy from his purpose, but my inclination ran too strong the other way. I argued it out that if Neil was on that road, it was the right road to find him in, leading direct to his chief's daughter; as for the other Highlandman, if I was to be startled off by every Highlandman I saw, I would scarce reach anywhere. And having quite satisfied myself with this disingenuous debate, I made the better speed of it, and came a little after four to Mrs. Drummond-Ogilvy's.|$|R
