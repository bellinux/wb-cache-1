This will help in designing correct IS which caters for faulty equipment. “NormalPos” is the initial state representing normal position, which is one of two positions for a point machine, as shown in Fig.  11. “ReversePos” state stands for reverse position.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the profitability of}} the fractals method as a <b>confirmation</b> <b>signal</b> to the existing simple moving average trading strategy in the futures market of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). To achieve this objective, historical data back-testing {{was used to evaluate}} the cost and risk-adjusted return performance of three different strategies, namely the buy and hold (naïve) strategy, the moving average crossover strategy, and the moving average with fractal confirmation strategy. Sharpe ratio was used to determine the highest level of return with regards to risk levels. One-way ANOVA method was used to determine if there is any strategy which generates statistically higher average return than the rest. Overall, the results indicated that while there is no statistically significant difference among the three strategies, the moving average with fractal confirmation strategy has the highest Sharpe ratio, followed by the buy and hold strategy and the moving average with crossover system. The higher Sharpe ratio of the fractals method implies that the fractals method serve as a better <b>confirmation</b> <b>signal</b> than the moving average cross system...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturing {{transitions}} {{have been}} increasing due to higher pressures for product variety. One dimension of this variety is color. A major quality control {{challenge is to}} regulate the color by capturing data on color in real-time during the operation and {{to use it to}} assess the opportunities for good parts. Control charting, when applied to a stable state process, is an effective monitoring tool to continuously check for process shifts or upsets. However, the presence of transition events can impede the normal performance of a traditional control chart. In this paper, we present an integrated model for statistical and vision monitoring using a tracking signal to determine the start of the transition and a <b>confirmation</b> <b>signal</b> to ensure that any process oscillation has concluded.

30|$|The {{requirement}} for extra warning time for pedestrians and motorists in grade crossings of high-speed rail operations {{is emerging as}} an additional issue for safety upgrades at such crossings. Currently, the typical warning time at crossings where pedestrians may be present is between 20 and 30  s for conventional speed trains. In an environment with 110  mile an hour trains, {{there would be a}} need to provide <b>confirmation</b> <b>signals</b> to the train crew and the onboard computer that the crossing is clear likely requiring a warning time of at least 80  s. The question about how pedestrians will react to such extended warning times at pedestrian crossings remains to be determined. This is because currently most of the warning time is built into the time that the train occupies the crossing. When high-speed trains begin to operate, most of the warning time is going to be built into the time for the train approaching the crossing. Therefore, there would be an extended warning time where the crossing remains unoccupied while a high-speed train cannot even be seen on the horizon. This situation will require “reeducation” of the public, especially in areas where crossings are very near to each other.|$|R
40|$|A {{system model}} of the primate neocortex is presented, based mainly on the {{neuroanatomy}} of the rhesus macaque monkey and consisting {{of a set of}} processing modules arranged as a perception-action hierarchy. These modules correspond to regions of the neocortex and their connectivity to that of the neocortex. A computational approach based on predicate logic is explained, and the results of a computer implementation of the model are reported, which demonstrate social behaviors involving affiliation and social conflict. The behavioral states of primates involved in these behaviors can be represented by the states of the system model, which have a logical representation and a diagrammatic form. It is shown how the behavioral states in goal-directed behaviors can be represented and also their short term moment-to-moment development in time. It is then shown how the state of social interaction among two or more primates can be represented, using their individual behavioral states, with interindividual action and perception. The causal dynamics of behavioral states is explained and also a control mechanism, namely, the use of <b>confirmation</b> <b>signals,</b> which stabilizes behavioral states and their dynamics. Stabilized behavioral states are seen as corresponding to coherent activations of the system, resulting from successful selection of module activations and intermodule communication with confirmation.

40|$|Interventions {{to improve}} caregiving may have {{different}} effects for persons with autonomous or nonautonomous attachment representations. The current study used the Adult Attachment Interview to investigate attachment representations of professional caregivers who participated in an intervention to improve interaction with children and adults with serious intellectual and visual disabilities. Caregivers (N = 51) completed a video-feedback interaction program. Twice during a baseline period and three times during the intervention period, each caregiver was videotaped during a standard situation with their client. Of the caregivers, 28 were classified as autonomous, 12 as dismissing, and 11 as preoccupied. Unresolved loss or trauma (n = 7) {{was not included in}} the analyses. Generally, interaction quality improved from baseline to intervention period as indicated by <b>confirmation</b> of <b>signals,</b> responsiveness to signals, and affective mutuality.

40|$|Evidence from {{a growing}} number of studies has {{revealed}} important contributions of a type of interaction identified as negotiation for the process of second language (L 2) learning. To date, no research has examined whether negotiation could assist learning L 2 syntax. The present study asked if negotiation could aid one process in learning L 2 syntax known as syntacticization. ^ The first research question addressed was: (1) To what extent are linguistic modifications during negotiation evidence of syntacticization? A second research interest focused on the effects of types of negotiation on syntacticization. Therefore, the second research question addressed was: (2) To what extent is there a differential effect for different types of negotiation moves on syntacticization? Previous research suggested that clarification signals during negotiation could elicit more linguistic modifications by learners than <b>confirmation</b> <b>signals.</b> Consequently, both types of negotiation move were investigated. ^ Research on L 2 learning has also revealed that negotiation provides opportunities for learners to comprehend unfamiliar input, to produce modified output, to be given feedback, and to focus on form. Evidence suggests that if negotiation was intensified and if discourse was manipulated to focus on specific L 2 features, then negotiation should affect syntacticization over time. This led to the third research question: (3) To what extent does negotiation affect syntacticization over time?. ^ A pretest-posttest-delayed posttest experimental design compared negotiation 2 ̆ 7 s potential to aid syntacticization among four groups of L 2 learners. Experimental/control treatments were contained within ten sessions as learners participated in communication tasks with native speakers through computerized writing conferences. ^ Results indicated that: (1) learners who interacted could stimulate syntacticization and continue to syntacticize over time, but those who negotiated accelerated the process over a short period, (2) syntacticization was not contingent on type of treatment, (3) syntacticization over short periods made no difference to group scores for pretest-posttest-delayed posttests targetting tense and aspect, and (4) clarification request signals during negotiation were significantly more effective for syntacticization than confirmation checks over a short time, but not over a longer period. ...|$|R

In the familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) -Turku LDL receptor allele, a mutation of glycine 823 residue affects the signal required for basolateral targeting in MDCK cells. We {{show that the}} mutant receptor is mistargeted to the apical surface in both MDCK and hepatic epithelial cells, resulting in reduced endocytosis of LDL from the basolateral/sinusoidal surface. Consequently, virally encoded mutant receptor fails to mediate cholesterol clearance in LDL receptor-deficient mice, suggesting that a defect in polarized LDL receptor expression in hepatocytes underlies the hypercholesterolemia in patients harboring this allele. This evidence directly links the pathogenesis of a human disease to defects in basolateral targeting signals, providing a genetic <b>confirmation</b> of these <b>signals</b> in maintaining epithelial cell polarity...|$|R

With this aim, both biocomponents have been immobilised in parallel onto interdigitated gold microelectrodes. The produced surfaces have been characterised by EIS and Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) Spectroscopy and have been applied to bacteria detection. Compared to immunocapture, detection using phages generates successive dual signals of opposite trend over time, which consist of an initial increase in impedance caused by bacteria capture followed by impedance decrease attributed to phage-induced lysis.

It {{is an important part of}} electronic countermeasures, and also a rapidly developed field of signal analysis. Communication signal modulation recognition is widely used in <b>signal</b> <b>confirmation,</b> interference identification, radio listening, signal monitoring, as well as software-defined radio, satellite communications and other fields. This paper proposed a digital modulation signal automatic recognition algorithm for satellite communication applications,. The algorithm uses the higher order cumulants of modulating signal, combined with constellation map features, to classify the signal. It has invariance in signal amplitude and phase deviation, and inhibits the additive Gaussian noise at the same time. Compared with other identification algorithms, it has the characteristics of stability and wide application. Computer simulations show that, under the given data length and moderate SNR conditions, a higher recognition rate (> 95 %) can be obtained. I.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a rapid method with little sample {{handling}} {{has been developed}} for determination of 23 selected volatile organic compounds in environmental and wastewater samples. The method is based on headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) followed by gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS) determination using triple quadrupole analyzer (QqQ) in electron ionization mode. The best conditions for extraction were optimised with a factorial design {{taking into account the}} interaction between different parameters and not only individual effects of variables. In the optimized procedure, 4  mL of water sample were extracted using a 10  mL vial and adding 0. 4  g NaCl (final NaCl content of 10 %). An SPME extraction with carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane 75  μm fiber for 30  min at 50  °C (with 5  min of previous equilibration time) with magnetic stirring was applied. Chromatographic determination was carried out by GC–MS/MS working in Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) mode. For most analytes, two MS/MS transitions were acquired, although for a few compounds it was difficult to obtain characteristic abundant fragments. In those cases, a pseudo selected reaction monitoring (pseudo-SRM) with three ions was used instead. The intensity ratio between quantitation (Q) and <b>confirmation</b> (q) <b>signals</b> was used as a confirmatory parameter. The method was validated by means of recovery experiments (n =  6) spiking mineral water samples at three concentration levels (0. 1, 5 and 50  μg L− 1). Recoveries between 70 % and 120 % were generally obtained with relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 20 %. The developed method was applied to surface water and wastewater from a wastewater treatment plant and from a municipal solid-waste treatment plant.
