40|$|WO 2010003979 A 1 UPAB: 20100122 NOVELTY - In a {{component}} for storing and discharging electrical energy, comprising flat electrochemical cells, {{each with a}} cathode, anode, separator and cathode and anode current collectors each having a <b>connecting</b> <b>tag</b> (12 a, 12 b, 13 a, 13 b), the cathode tag (13 a) of one cell (20 a) is positioned relative to the anode tag (12 b) of an adjacent cell (20 b) such that magnetic fields generated by moving electric charges in the tags overlap and compensate for each other. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An electrochemical component for storing and discharging electrical energy comprises at least two electrochemical cells (20 a, 20 b), each with a flat cathode, flat anode and flat separator and cathode and anode current collectors (connected to the cathode and anode respectively and each having a <b>connecting</b> <b>tag</b> (12 a, 12 b, 13 a, 13 b)). The novel feature is that the cells are relatively aligned with the tag (13 a) for the cathode of one cell (20 a) positioned relative to the tag (12 b) for the anode of an adjacent cell (20 b) {{in such a way}} that magnetic fields generated by moving electric charges in the tags overlap and compensate for each other. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the production of the electrochemical components, by locating at least two flat primary or secondary cells (20 a, 20 b) adjacent to each other, with the connecting tags (12 a, 12 b, 13 a, 13 b) of one cells forming a four-pole arrangement. USE - The electrochemical components are generally in the form of batteries or accumulators of various sizes and shapes for all types of applications, specifically flat batteries or accumulators consisting of foil-like layers, especially lithium ion or lithium-polymer cells. They are particularly useful in magnetic field-sensitive applications, e. g. in devices for measuring disturbances in the earth's magnetic field (typically to detect archeological articles) or in magnetic field-sensitive sensors or location systems (typically for medicinal or military use). ADVANTAGE - Formation of stray magnetic fields is minimized, thus reducing or eliminating charge flow-sensitive magnetic field fluctuations having an adverse effect in magnetic field-sensitive applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{next stage}} of the home {{networking}} environment {{is supposed to be}} ubiquitous, where each piece of material is equipped with an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tag. To fully support the ubiquitous environment, home networking middleware should be able to recommend home services based on a user’s interests and efficiently manage information on service usage profiles for the users. Therefore, USN (Ubiquitous Sensor Network) technology, which recognizes and manages a appliance’s state-information (location, capabilities, and so on) by <b>connecting</b> RFID <b>tags</b> is considered.

40|$|Abstract—The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} social media is shortening {{the distance between}} people. Social activities, e. g., tagging in Flickr, bookmarking in Delicious, twittering in Twitter, etc. are reshaping people’s social life and redefining their social roles. People with shared interests tend to form their groups in social media, and users within the same community likely exhibit similar social behavior (e. g., going for the same movies, having similar political viewpoints), which in turn reinforces the community structure. The multiple interactions in social activities entail that the community structures are often overlapping, i. e., one person is involved in several communities. We propose a novel co-clustering framework, which takes advantage of networking information between users and tags in social media, to discover these overlapping communities. In our method, users are <b>connected</b> via <b>tags</b> and <b>tags</b> are <b>connected</b> to users. This explicit representation of users and tags is useful for understanding group evolution by looking at who is interested in what. The efficacy of our method is supported by empirical evaluation in both synthetic and online social networking data...|$|R

With new inexpensive printed memory, {{it will be}} possible to manufacture cheap surveillance tags that are capable to tell the user if something has happened within a timeline. This project is within the ITC FrameProgram 7 founded project PriMeBits. The goal is to imple‐ment a write once read many memory (WORM) onto an RF‐tag together with a sensor that can sense wetness, which can be detected by EAS antitheft systems. Pre researches have been done in the fields printed capacitance, coils and WORMs, all printed with silver ink. Before implementation of a WORM onto a tag simulations and laboratory tests with adjustable resistances were made. Two different circuit models are simulated and tested. When <b>connected</b> to a <b>tag</b> and the WORM is un‐programmed, the EAS system should not trigger an alarm. But if the WORM is programmed by the sensor, the alarm should trigger. Results show that capacitances and WORMs are printable with this technique but coils are not due to high inner resistance. The simulations show that a tag built as an LCCR‐circuit is the best choice. This is also confirmed with tests done with real resistors. With WORMs <b>connected</b> to a <b>tag</b> the results show that approximately 70 % of them work as intended, this is because the WORMs as of now are not completely developed. The conclusion of this project is that it is possible to implement a WORM onto a tag with further research, to make an inexpensive surveillance tag. PriMeBit...|$|R

Second, the information of the moving target in the current frame is preliminarily extracted adopting the background subtraction algorithm, it achieves image segmentation and the division of the best detection area according to the imaging features of vehicles in different lanes by using morphological filtering and setting up the detection window. Then, model classification is done using the <b>connected</b> domain <b>tags</b> and template matching for vehicles in detection region. Finally, vehicle information each frame detects is counted by lanes. The experimental results present that the algorithm for dividing the best detection region segmentation image can reduce the miss rate and the false detection rate to the maximum extent.
