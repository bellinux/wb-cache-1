The doctrine is relevant {{in a variety of}} contexts, including abandonment, tacking, claim preclusion, and the Morehouse defense. A number of courts considering the issue have concluded that continuing <b>commercial</b> <b>impression</b> is a pure question of law. This article argues that such a view is incorrect, and that the doctrine should present a mixed question of law and fact. In determining whether continuing <b>commercial</b> <b>impression</b> exists, the sole factor should not be the visual or aural appearance of the mark. Instead, <b>commercial</b> <b>impression</b> should be tested by a range of evidence, including consumer survey evidence, if it is available. This Article then examines two rare examples where survey evidence has been gathered and proffered to assess the existence of continuing <b>commercial</b> <b>impression.</b> The Article concludes by drawing implications from these examples for future efforts to use consumer survey evidence to establish or rebut the existence of commercial impressio...|$|R
40|$|A {{trademark}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{or trade}} dress 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 2 <b>commercial</b> <b>impression</b> 2 ̆ 2 {{is the meaning}} or idea it conveys to consumers. Courts and administrative tribunals sometimes are confronted with deciding whether a mark or dress generates a 2 ̆ 2 continuing <b>commercial</b> <b>impression.</b> 2 ̆ 2 In some instances, this arises in regard to questions of abandonment [...] although a mark or trade dress has not been used {{for a period of}} time, the trier of fact must determine whether the public continues to have accurate lingering impressions associated with that mark or dress. In other instances, because corporations periodically make slight modifications to their marks and trade dress in an effort to update and modernize them, triers of fact are called on to determine whether the newer mark or dress generates a 2 ̆ 2 continuing <b>commercial</b> <b>impression</b> 2 ̆ 2 among the relevant public. Essentially holding that legal equivalence is a matter of law, in arriving at their determination of continuing <b>commercial</b> <b>impression,</b> triers of fact have relied upon argument and their own inclinations. We argue for a broadening of this perspective. Marks are deemed to be legal equivalents if they create the same continuing <b>commercial</b> <b>impression.</b> As the impression is one that is created in consumers, it seems counterintuitive to conclude that the only relevant evidence is that of an antiseptic analysis of the visual or aural appearance of the marks themselves. Rather, the determination of whether marks are legal equivalents is more properly a mixed question of fact and law [...] one that, as in other contexts, can be tested by a range of evidence, including consumer survey evidence. We then go on to describe and discuss the only two known occasions where survey evidence has been gathered and proffered in regard to assessing 2 ̆ 2 continuing <b>commercial</b> <b>impression,</b> 2 ̆ 2 and draw implications from these for future efforts at using consumer survey evidence to support a claim of continuing <b>commercial</b> <b>impression...</b>|$|R

40|$|Trademark tacking {{allows a}} mark owner to adjust her mark without losing protection. The test for {{determining}} whether tacking is appropriate {{is whether the}} new mark is the legal equivalent of the old. This equivalency is measured by evaluating the continuing <b>commercial</b> <b>impression</b> created by the marks. A circuit split has developed over whether this test {{is a question of}} law or a question of fact. This Comment argues that the continuing <b>commercial</b> <b>impression</b> test is ill-suited to be measured as a question of law. Initially, this Comment focuses on how <b>commercial</b> <b>impression</b> is a fact-based inquiry and should be measured as such. This involves a discussion about the roles of the fact and law finders, a comparison to the likelihood of confusion analysis, as well as its treatment in court, and the complexities involved in determining consumer impression...|$|R

40|$|We {{explored}} formation-structure-property {{relationships in}} thiol-ene functionalized oligosiloxanes to create crosslinked networks. Specifically, nine oligomers were synthesized, three with thiol-functional silane repeats and three with allyl-functional silane repeats. Structural variations in each oligomer were systematically induced through {{the incorporation of}} non-reactive repeats bearing either diphenyl or di-n-octyl moieties, and the oligomer molecular weight was limited {{by the presence of}} monofunctional silane condensation species. The molecular weights and chain compositions of all oligomers were ascertained and subsequently used in the evaluation of network properties formed upon photopolymerization of thiol- and ene-functional reactants. Polymerization kinetics of the thiol-ene functionalized siloxanes were also investigated using photoinitiation owing to the spatial and temporal control afforded by this technique. In particular, the effects of the viscosity of the ene-functionalized oligomer and the degree of thiol functionalization on the observed polymerization rate were determined. Results showed that the speed of polymerization varied with changes to the rate-limiting step, which was heavily influenced by neighboring non-reactive functionalities. Moreover, the thiol-ene reaction was found to exhibity unimolecular termination exclusively in siloxane-based systems. Proposed use of the thiol-ene functionalized siloxane system as a dental impression material necessitated the development of a redox initiation scheme. Evaluation of the benzoylperoxide/dimethyl-p-toluidine redox pair in traditional systems showed bulk thiol-ene polymerizations comparable to photoinitiation with the added advantage of uninhibited depth control, as also demonstrated in small molecule thiol-ene coupling reactions initiated by this same redox system. Application of the redox pair to the siloxane system allowed for the viscoelastic properties as well as the feature replication abilities to be compared against <b>commercial</b> <b>impression</b> materials. The siloxane system was found to match the commercial material for strain recovery and stress relaxation and exceed its replication properties though it would require greater overall strength to function adequately in the clinical setting...|$|R

40|$|Background/purpose: This study {{compared}} the surface roughness of gypsum models constructed using various impression materials, gypsum products, and storage times before repouring. Materials and methods: Three alginate <b>impression</b> materials, four <b>commercial</b> silicone <b>impression</b> materials, and {{three types of}} gypsum product (MG crystal rock, Super hard stone, and MS plaster) were used. Impression materials were mixed and poured into five plastic rings (20  mm in diameter and 2  mm high) for each group, and the surfaces of the set gypsum product models of 63 groups, which were poured immediately, and 1 hour and 24 hours later, were assessed using a surface roughness tester. One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni's comparison tests {{were used for the}} statistical analyses. Results: The surface roughness: (1) was greater for most specimens constructed from alginate impression material (2. 72  ±  0. 45 – 7. 42  ±  0. 66  μm) than from silicone impression materials (1. 86  ±  0. 19 – 2. 75  ±  0. 44  μm); (2) differed with the type of gypsum product when using alginate impression materials (surface roughness of Super hard stone > MG crystal rock > MS plaster), but differed little for silicone impression materials; and (3) differed very little with the storage time before repouring. Conclusion: The surface roughness of stone models was mainly determined by the type of alginate impression material, and was less affected by the type of silicone rubber impression material or gypsum product, or the storage time before repouring...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{accuracy}} of Automatic Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) {{is dependent on}} many variables ranging from {{the quality of the}} friction skin surface itself, to the ability of the image acquisition device to accurately image the fingerprint, to the feature extract and match software to detect the feature set and declare a correlation (a match/no match) based on some criteria. The genesis of these systems exclusively used rolled impression fingerprint imagery. As AFIS developers attempted to reduce the cost and improve the usability of these systems for <b>commercial</b> applications, plain <b>impression</b> imagery was adopted and total scanned image area was significantly reduced. This paper will attempt to quantify the effects of reduced image area on overall system accuracy in a single finger plain impression environment. The results can be directly applied by AFIS designers as they attempt to meet systems requirements with respect to key accuracy parameters such as false match rates, false non-match rates and the resulting workload caused by the system. ...|$|R
40|$|Resumo: O objetivo neste estudo foi medir e comparar a precisão {{dimensional}} de modelos de gesso confeccionados a partir de três técnicas de moldagem com dez diferentes elastômeros. Um modelo em cera, simulando um arco dental mandibular, teve retirados os dentes 44, 45 e 46 a fim de avaliar possíveis diferenças de precisão entre os lados direito e esquerdo, pelo maior volume dematerial de moldagem do lado direito, o que poderia acarretar em maior contração e conseqüentemente maior alteração desse lado. A partir desse modelo em cera foi obtido um modelo metálico padrão com pontos de referência nos dentes 33 (CE), 43 (CD), 37 (ME) e 47 (MD) que foi utilizado para a realização das moldagens. Foram medidas as distâncias entre os dentes CE-CD, ME-MD, CEME e CD-MD. Moldeiras metálicas de estoque foram usadas para as técnicas doreembasamento e dupla mistura. Já para a técnica da moldeira individual, moldeiras de resina acrílica foram confeccionadas com alívio interno de aproximadamente 2 mm. Adesivos específicos para cada material foram usados nas moldeiras individuais, para promover adesão na moldeira. Todos os procedimentos de moldagem foram realizados em uma sala com temperatura e umidade relativa controladas. A manipulação dos materiais foi feita segundo as instruções dos fabricantes. O movimento de retirada da moldeira, após a presa do material de moldagem, foi padronizado por meio de um equipamento pneumático evitando possíveis distorções no molde. Os modelos de gesso foram vazados após trinta minutos da obtenção dos moldes, para promover a recuperação elástica dos materiais. Foram confeccionados cinco corpos-de-prova para cada marca comercial de elastômero e técnica de moldagem, totalizando cento e trinta amostras. Após 24 horas, foi feita a separação molde-modelo, sendo o modelo observado em microscópio comparador com 30 x de aumento. Três leituras foram feitas em cada uma das distâncias analisadas, obtendo-se uma média que foi, posteriormente, analisada estatisticamente, por meio da análise de variância com três fatores ou com dois fatores e as médias comparadas pelo teste de Tukey (5 %). Os resultados demonstraram que os silicones polimerizados por adição foram os materiais que mostraram melhores resultados de precisão dimensional dos modelos. Os silicones polimerizados por condensação apresentaram os piores resultados. Todas as distâncias mensuradas apresentaram alterações lineares negativas (contração), sendo que as distâncias ântero-posteriores (CEME e CD-MD) sofreram mais alterações quando comparadas com as distâncias transversais (CE-CD e ME-MD). Num contexto geral, não houve diferença entre as distâncias MD-CD e ME-CE. Também não foram encontradas diferenças entre as técnicas de moldagem. A precisão dos modelos de gesso foi mais afetada pelos materiais do que pela técnica de moldagem. Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was assess and compare the dimensional accuracy ofstone models made from of three impression techniques and ten different elastomeric materials. A wax model, simulating a lower dental arch, had removed the teeth 44, 45 and 46 in order to evaluate possible differences of accuracy between the right and left sides, by the bigger volume of impression material on the right side that could lead in bigger contraction and, consequently, biggerchange in this side. From this wax model was obtained a metallic master model with reference points in the teeth 33 (LC), 43 (LM), 37 (RC) and 47 (RM) that was used for the accomplishment of the impressions. The distances were measured among the teeth LC-RC, LM-RM, LC-LM and RC-RM. Stock metallic trays were used for the putty/wash technique and double mix technique. For the single mix technique custom acrylic resin trays were made with internal relief of approximately 2 mm. Specific adhesives for each material were used in the custom trays, to promote adhesion in the trays. All impressions procedures were made at room with temperature and relative humidity controlled. The materials handled were made following the manufacturers' instructions. The tray movement, after the impression aterial set, was standardized through of a pneumatic equipment avoiding possible distortions in the mold. The stone models were pouring after thirty minutes of the molds obtaining, to promote the materials elastic recovery. Five specimens were made for each elastomeric material <b>commercial</b> mark and <b>impression</b> technique, totaling one hundred thirty samples. After 24 hours, the separation mold/model was made, being the model observed in measuringmicroscope at 30 x magnification. Three measurements were made in each one ofthe analyzed dimensions, getting a mean that was later analyzed statisticallythrough of variance analysis three-way or two-way and the means compared byTukey's test (5 %). The results demonstrated that addition silicones were thematerials that showed better results of models dimensional accuracy. The condensation silicones showed the worst results. All distances assessed showednegative linear change (contraction), being that the anteroposterior distances (LCLMand RC-RM) suffered more changes when compared with the transversaldistances (LC-RC and LM-RM). In general, there wasn't difference between thedistances LC-LM and RC-RM. There wasn't found differences between theimpression techniques. The stone models accuracy was more affected by thematerials than the impression technique...|$|R
