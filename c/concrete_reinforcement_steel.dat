40|$|AbstractConventional bridge seismic design {{practices}} {{depend on}} the ductility capacity of bridge columns. However, damaged columns tend to produce large residual deformations following a seismic event due {{to the formation of}} a flexural plastic hinge. Improved seismic response can be realized through the use of unbonded post-tensioning prestressing cast-in-place (CIP) column systems or precast segmental column systems. These bridge column systems can produce significantly less residual displacements when compared to a traditional concrete column. Moreover, precast segmental construction can also significantly reduce construction time and minimize construction cost of bridges in highly congested urban environments. Therefore, one research thrust area of bridges is the seismic performance of prestressing CIP reinforcement concrete columns and prestressing precast segmental column systems which were investigated through quasi-static, shake table test and numerical analyses. However, numerical analytical models which can allow for major nonlinear factors of prestressing concrete bridge column systems are not available yet. This paper presents the numerical analytical models which can be easily carried out in the structural analysis software for seismic response of prestressing CIP reinforced concrete and precast segmental bridge column systems. The numerical analytical model consists of segment model, prestressing tendon model and joint model. Segment model is modeled by nonlinear fiber beam-column elements which sophisticated constitutive models are used to simulate the non-linear cyclic behavior of the <b>concrete,</b> <b>reinforcement</b> <b>steel</b> and bonded prestressing tendons. Unbonded prestressing tendons is modeled by “tension-only” bilinear cyclic truss elements, each node of the truss is laterally constrained to the adjacent segmental element node.

40|$|Waste water {{treatment}} reservoirs are contaminated with many hazardous chemicals and acids. Reservoirs typically comprise <b>concrete</b> and <b>reinforcement</b> <b>steel</b> bars, {{and the main}} elements responsible for their deterioration are hazardous chemicals, acids, and ozone. Currently, {{a variety of techniques}} are being used to protect reservoirs from exposure to these elements. The most widely used techniques are stainless steel plating and polymeric coating. In this study, a technique known as arc thermal spraying was used. It is a more convenient and economical method for protecting both <b>concrete</b> and <b>reinforcement</b> <b>steel</b> bar from deterioration in waste {{water treatment}} reservoirs. In this study, 316 L stainless steel coating was applied to a concrete surface, and different electrochemical experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of coatings in different acidic pH solutions. The coating generated from the arc thermal spraying process significantly protected the concrete surface from corrosion in acidic pH solutions, owing to the formation of a double layer capacitance—a mixture of Cr 3 + enriched with Cr 2 O 3 and Cr-hydroxide in inner and Fe 3 + oxide on the outer layer of the coating. The formation of this passive film is defective owing to the non-homogeneous 316 L stainless steel coating surface. In the pH 5 solution, the growth of a passive film is adequate due to the presence of un-dissociated water molecules in the aqueous sulfuric acid solution. The coated surface is sealed with alkyl epoxide, which acts as a barrier against the penetration of acidic solutions. This coating exhibits higher impedance values among the three studied acidic pH solutions...|$|R

The finite element model consisted of modelling the geometry of elements with their materials and related constraints, such as boundary conditions, applying loads and the contacts between the different surfaces. The normal concrete, UHPC, and steel-plates were modeled using the three-dimensional eight-noded brick elements. Whereas, the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>steel</b> (longitudinal and transverse) were modeled with two nodes 3 D truss elements. The bond between <b>concrete</b> and <b>reinforcement</b> <b>steel</b> was modeled as an embedded region, whereas the concrete is considered as the host element. The bond between normal concrete and UHPC was considered as perfect-bond because during all experimental tests there was no debonding observed. The steel plates were bonded to the concrete surfaces with tie-bond. The concrete damage plasticity model was used, which is reported to give reliable results (Sümer and Aktaş 2015). Accordingly, by using such model, the complete behavior of full-scale strengthened beams can be achieved without conducting any experimental testing of beam.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTraditional {{material}} for <b>concrete</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is <b>steel.</b> In recent times, non-metallic fibres have been intensively investigated {{and some of}} them used for construction of bridges. FRP composites are durable materials which are different from the <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> for their resistance to the electrochemical corrosion. With respect to steel, different mechanical behavior of non-metallic reinforcement, however, involves some drawbacks - namely the lack of thermal compatibility between <b>concrete</b> and FRP <b>reinforcement.</b> FRP composites belong among anisotropic materials. Their properties depend on the type, volume and alignment of the fibres, the matrix type, form and quality of the construction. The analysis of causes of failures on German bridges shows that reinforcement corrosion initiated by chlorides makes up 2 / 3 of all the failures recorded in the bridge construction. Corrosion of the reinforcement initiated by chlorides is the main cause of the loss of serviceability of bridge structures. In such an environment, fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement can fully replace the traditional <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The paper presents the mechanical properties and durability of different types of the FRP rebar's and their use in construction of bridges...|$|R

The prestress in the CFRP sheets is the primary reason for the increase in stiffness because prestressed CFRP sheets confine the tensioned face of the beams, reduce the widening of flexural cracks and delay the damage evolution of the steel bars during fatigue cyclic loading.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Signal {{processing}} {{techniques can}} improve the feature identification of impact-echo signals obtained from buried objects in <b>concrete.</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> <b>steel</b> tubes, and PVC tubes embedded in concrete slabs are tested. The received signals, both experimental and simulated, are analyzed using both fast Fourier transform (fft) and continuous wavelet transform. The amplitude spectra, based on fft, can only provide global information and lose- important local effects of frequency components. This is resolved by preserving the transient effects in the frequency domain using continuous wavelet transform. Features related to embedded steel bar and PVC and steel tubes can thus be recognized according to the difference in scales and lasting periods in the magnitude plot of wavelet coefficients. Furthermore, the same peak frequency found in the amplitude spectrum is now distinguishable between PVC and steel tubes at a resolution of 0. 2 kHz or better. Such findings provide a more effective way to pick up true rebar signals using the impact-echo method. Introduction: Conventional Fourier analysis provides only mean coefficients representing spectral composition of a signal. These coefficients are independent of time {{and may not be}} suitable for analyzing all signals. Two signals with the same spectral density could exhibit completely different transient characteristics, as illustrated by Newland [1]. Furthermore, the information revealed by Fourier analysis is sometimes confounded with a number of frequency components due to noise of various sources. This is particularly important when dealing with elastic wave propagatio...|$|R
30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the <b>concrete</b> and <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> {{quantities}} of the foundation system are generally proportional to those of the building’s RC shear walls. The higher wall moment at the base would result in a bigger wall foundation with more reinforcement. Moreover, the formwork used in the shear wall construction will be directly affected by the concrete volume (shown in Table  3), i.e., the less amount of concrete used in the wall construction would reduce the formwork-related cost.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} {{to the amount of}} <b>concrete</b> and <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> material used for RC shear wall construction, the rebar work is another factor that affects the economy and constructability of RC buildings. Rebar work accounts for about 30 % of the entire reinforcing cost for RC construction, and is also a time‐consuming element of the construction process (Kang et al. 2013). Despite that ductile wall design involves stricter requirements that may increase the rebar work compared to conventional construction, the reduced design forces in case of ductile walls can result in a smaller amount of <b>steel</b> <b>reinforcement</b> (as was seen in Fig.  4), which could lead to less rebar work.|$|R
