40|$|We {{study the}} {{interaction}} forces between two plates in a semi-dilute solution of polymers each having one weakly adsorbing end-group. We {{show that this}} system exhibits both repulsive and attractive interactions of comparable magnitude and well-separated length scales: when the plate separation is within a range of order the end-to-end distance of the end-adsorbed polymer, repulsion arises with a magnitude of ϵΦ/Na 3 where ϵ is the end-adsorption energy, N is the degree of polymerization, a is the Kuhn length and Φ the volume fraction of the polymer. This repulsion is due to desorption of the end-adsorbed <b>chains.</b> At <b>plate</b> separations <b>of</b> order the correlation length of the solution, a depletion attraction sets in with a magnitude that scales with the bulk osmotic pressure...|$|R

While thus engaged in working and stopping her attention was attracted by the sudden rising and running away of the sheep squatted on the down; and there succeeded sounds of a heavy tramping over the hard sod which the sheep had quitted, the tramp being accompanied by a metallic jingle. Turning her eyes further she beheld two cavalry soldiers on bulky grey chargers, armed and accoutred throughout, ascending the down at a point to the left where the incline was comparatively easy.

40|$|Most {{chains are}} an {{assembly}} [1] of five parts namely, outer plate, inner plate, bush, pin and roller. Two inner plates are press fitted with two bushes {{to form an}} inner block assembly. The outer plates are press fitted with pins after keeping the pins through the assembled bushes of the inner block. Roller is a rotating member and placed over the bush during inner block assembly. Inner block assembly is the load transfer member from sprocket tooth. The outer block assembly helps in holding and also to pull the inner block over the sprocket teeth. If a chain length is in odd number of pitches, it requires an offset plate as shown in Figure 1 to connect two ends of the chain together to make chain endless. When the chain is assembled with an offset <b>plate,</b> the <b>chain</b> fatigue life was observed only 20 to 25 % of the total life of a chain, assembled without an offset plate. The holes in the offset <b>plate</b> are <b>of</b> {{the same size as}} in the outer and inner plates respectively and it is a complex in shape <b>chain</b> <b>plate.</b> A inbuilt thinning zone at the centre <b>of</b> the <b>chain</b> <b>plate</b> as shown in Figure 1 is unavoidable. The stresses and its distribution in this complex shape <b>chain</b> <b>plate</b> geometry {{play a critical role in}} the fatigue life performance of a chain assembly. However, it is difficult identify the stress distribution and stress concentration zones precisely using only the conventional industrial friendly tools such as routine quality control test, breaking load test and numerical computations.

40|$|The Lost Foam Casting {{process has}} been firmly {{established}} for Aluminium and ferrous alloys. This process offers many advantages over conventional casting processes but its full potential {{has yet to be}} reached due to the many defects introduced to the casting associated with decomposition of the foam pattern during mould filling. The foam pattern commonly used in this process is Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) which degrades to liquid and vapour byproducts. The liquid decomposition byproducts travel to the metal/mould interface, where the globules of liquid foam can become trapped against the coating and their molecular weight is reduced due to the heat from the molten metal. At the same time, they release bubbles of gas into the castings. These globules can wick into the refractory coating only if their molecular weight is sufficiently reduced to below a critical molecular weight. In this study, {{to improve the quality of}} Aluminium alloys made by Lost Foam Casting, easier removal of the decomposition byproducts was obtained by using low molecular weight foam patterns. The molecular weight of expanded Polystyrene was not reduced when it was exposed to γ-rays because of cross-linking while the molecular weight of Poly Methyl Methacrylate (PMMA) was significantly due to <b>chain</b> session. Therefore, <b>plates</b> <b>of</b> Probead- 70 ™ (a copolymer of Polystyrene 30 wt...|$|R
