50|$|The Dutch {{network has}} several <b>cross-border</b> <b>sections</b> to Belgium and Germany. Of these, Terneuzen {{is linked to}} Belgium (freight-only), {{but not to the}} rest of the Dutch network. Contrarily, Lanaken (B) is {{connected}} to Maastricht (also freight only) but not to the Belgian network. Six cross-border links are electrified. Due to the difference in voltage, trains must change monovoltage locomotives at Bad Bentheim or Venlo; monovoltage Belgian 3 kV trains reach Roosendaal and Maastricht with reduced power. The HSL Zuid has no voltage change at the border itself. Alternatively, multi-system train units or diesel traction is used. Several border crossings are disused or freight-only. There are no breaks of gauge at any of the crossings.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the summit}} {{between the two}} Koreas in 2000, an effort has slowly been {{underway}} to reconnect the Gyeongui Line. Southern passenger service has been extended to Dorasan {{on the edge of}} the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and tracks have been built across the DMZ itself. In October 2004, the Northern connection from the DMZ to Kaesŏng was finally completed. Simultaneous test runs along the rebuilt <b>cross-border</b> <b>sections</b> of both the Gyeongui Line and the Donghae Bukbu Line were set for May 25, 2006, but North Korean military authorities cancelled the plans a day ahead of the scheduled event. However, at a meeting held in Pyongyang, North Korea, on April 22, 2007, North and South Korea agreed to restart the project. On May 17, 2007, the first train, carrying North and South Korean delegations, travelled from Munsan Station in the South to Kaesong in the North. The first test run on the Donghae Bukbu Line took place at the same time. According to South Korean representatives, the North has agreed in principle to regular passenger and freight service along the two train lines.|$|E

The deployment of the new signaling system (ERTMS) across heterogeneous institutional and technical environments raises diverse issues. These are empirically analyzed by taking the case of the ERTMS corridor D (Valencia-Budapest) with a special concern for <b>cross-border</b> <b>sections</b> and the role a specif-ically designed micro-institution plays in ruling this priority project.

50|$|After {{the fall}} of the Inner German Border the line through the gap between Neustadt and Sonneberg was {{immediately}} reinstated. Some of the land had to be bought back as only a few years earlier part of the line had been sold to the Bavarian forest service. On 28 September 1991 the 3.5 km long, former <b>cross-border</b> <b>section</b> from Neustadt to Sonneberg was returned to service, it was electrified from the first day.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{need for}} transportation and mobility of citizen gives raises the importance oftransportation policy. The {{development of the}} European transportation policy has a great significance for theEuropean Union. The common transportation policy of the European Union is reviewed and updated everynine years. The first common transportation policy of the European Commission was published in December 1992. Besides the railway sector, most of the objectives listed in this policy were realized in ten years. In 2001, the European Commission proffered a new transportation policy with sixty new measures. Thus, thispaper shows the importance of transportation projects -especially {{in the field of}} railways- for European Unionmember states. In accounting, <b>cross-border</b> <b>sections</b> of projects are more or less neglected, as member statestend to prioritize the development of sections of the projects, which are economically viable for themselves,thereby delaying the overall connectivity of the trans-European network. The railway modal is the hardestmodal to interoperate between the member countries. Therefore it is not a surprise that the objectives listed inthe first European transportation policy were not realized in the railway sector. There were enormousdifferences between railway systems before the European Union. Some of them still have an influence oncurrent railway infrastructure and operations today. To sum up, this research shall deal with the crucialaspects of common transportation policies as well as problems of its implications...|$|E

It was opened in 1870 {{as part of}} the Austro-Hungarian Rudolfsbahn railway network. Today, only the Slovenian section between Jesenice and Ljubljana is still open to traffic, {{as part of the}} main line between Ljubljana and Villach in Austria; the <b>cross-border</b> <b>section</b> between Jesenice and Tarvisio has been closed to traffic since 1967 (Italian part) and 1969 (Slovenian part).|$|R
5000|$|During {{the efforts}} to re-open the <b>cross-border</b> <b>section,</b> the South Korean {{government}} has taken {{up the idea of}} a railway all along the east coast from Pohang to the North Korean border, with a primary aim to serve freight traffic that could eventually access the Trans-Siberian Railway. [...] As part of the project, plans foresaw to connect the end of the Yeongdong Line in Gangneung with Jejin by 110.2 km long, single-track, non-electrified line for 150 km/h, effectively re-building the Donghae Bukbu Line on a new alignment.|$|R
5000|$|With {{increasing}} talk {{of peaceful}} Korean reunification {{beginning in the}} 1990s, there have been various efforts to reopen the Donghae Bukbu Line, together with the Gyeongui Line in the west. [...] An opened Donghae Bukbu Line would provide ready land access to the Mount Kumgang Tourist Region, which is open to South Korean tourists. After the completion of reconstruction on the 11.1 km <b>cross-border</b> <b>section</b> between Jejin in South Korea and Gamho in North Korea, the initial test run was set for May 25, 2006, but North Korean military authorities cancelled the plans a day ahead of the scheduled event. On the South Korean side, Korail opened Jejin Station in 2006 and has maintained some rolling stock for a trial run.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of valorising a community's cultural heritage {{is inseparable from}} the dynamics for its fruition. The study focused on a <b>cross-border</b> <b>section</b> encompassing the Italian and Dalmatian coastlines and examined the spatial declinations of new tourism practices {{with the aim of}} defining a unique field of experimentation involving different forms, natural and cultural, of environmental heritage. The method is an experimental one, exploiting the use of architectural planning to develop tools for defining suitable spaces to new free time practices. The results illustrate a form of development for local communities in which the valorisation of endogenous resources and the introduction of new, through experimental architecture, can contribute to renewing the meaning of the "cultural heritage": a collection of assets, all but closed, open and dynamic, in perpetual expansion...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of thawing {{relations}} between South and North Korea, when the <b>cross-border</b> <b>section</b> of the Donghae Bukbu Line was reopened in 2007, the South Korean government considered {{the construction of a}} railway for freight traffic all along the east coast to the North Korean border. [...] This line would incorporate the Donghae-Gangneung section of the Yeongdong Line and the Samcheok branch, and connect to newly built lines at Samcheok and Gangneung. Three years later, the project re-surfaced as a domestic project. On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. Under the plan, the east coast line, including the section of the Yeongdong Line from Donghae to Gangneung and the Samcheok Line, would be upgraded for 230 km/h, and may see KTX service.|$|R

The road, its politics, and its poetics constitute an ideal point of entry for an anthropological analysis of contemporary South Albania. The physical and social construction, uses, and perceptions of this road uniquely encapsulate three phenomena that dominate social life in postsocialist South Albania: {{the transition to a}} market economy, new nationalisms, and massive emigration (mainly to Greece). Taking this <b>cross-border</b> road <b>section</b> as my main ethnographic point of reference, I suggest the fruitfulness of further discussion of the relationship between roads, narratives, and anthropology...|$|R
