40|$|The {{research}} {{was made to}} determine the managemental practices of Ryukyu-Matsu in the mixed forest of the pine and broad-leaved trees. The author reviewed various literatures that published in the Ryukyus on the management Of Ryukyu-Matsu forests and discussed in the historical viewpoint, and described the results of This research. 1. Points that have been considered for its management are as follows. a. For the reviewal of plant growth, importance should {{be attached to the}} seed-shedding and natural sprouting, but artificial planting should be considered. b. Trees are better to be closely planted, and broad-leaved trees including soil improving trees are better to be mixed. c. Shelter belts are better to be established and gap clear cutting is to be practiced. d. Final age of the trees is to be 25 - 40 years. 2. The data of this investigation were taken from two stands in Oku National Forest. Where are about 50 species of broad-leaved trees mixed with the pine trees as the underwood. The ages of the pine trees range from 23 to 38 years, and those of the broad-leaved trees. from 18 to 38 in the stand 1; and in the stand 2, those of the pine trees from 24 to 39, and those of the broad-leaved trees from 15 to 36. The average number age of the pine trees in 33 years and the average area age of the broad-leaved trees in 32 years. The number of the pine trees in the stand I in 940, and that of the broad-leaved trees In 4200; and in the stand 2, that of the pine trees in 530, and that of the broad-leaved trees 7450. The volume of the pine trees per ha in the stand I is 120 m^ 3, and that of the broad- Leaved trees in 90 m^ 3; and in the stand 2,that of the pine tree is 90 m^ 3, and that of the broad-leaved trees is 210 m^ 3. 3. As the result of the investigation, the following practices are suggested. a. In Oku National Forest, shelter belts should be made principally, in the directions of north-east, east and south-east. b. The number of the pine trees should be increased, and useful species including soil improving trees of broad-leaved trees as the underwood should be encouraged to grow. To improve the forest in that way, useful broad-leaved trees should be artificialy planted without relying upon regeneration by sprouts of advancely grown trees. And tending of trees after regeneration should be actively done. c. Poor trees of the pine are just living and the increment of growth of them are not recognized. Therefore, the age of those in the mixed forests with broad-leaved trees should be limited to certain short period to produce overwoods. d. The final age of the pine is considered that 20 - 40 years are proper. Especially for the production of pulp wood, the final age of the pine is best considered to be 2025 years. If <b>coppice</b> <b>with</b> <b>standard</b> <b>system</b> is to be practiced, it is best considered to give 40 years for final age of the overwood (the pine) and 20 years trees. Forests where Ryukyuan bamboos are growing, the growth of trees is kindered; therefore, efforts for the control of them should be made...|$|R

40|$|Large {{areas of}} the German forests are privately owned. Many of these stands are small, to very small in size. In Thuringia, 63 % of the private forests are under the {{proprietorship}} of woodland owners; contracted areas < 20 ha, covering 22. 6 % of the Thuringian forest area (BMVE L 2004). This ownership structure results from the division of cooperatives since the 13 th Century. Due to distributions of rural estates between heirs and additional sales, the parcel size has been further diminished throughout the last decades and centuries. As {{a result of this}} development, and changing interests of woodland owners in these forest stands, an economically reliable management seems to be hardly possible. In the present article four spatially separate stripped forest stands were investigated in Western Thuringia, Germany. These stands were analyzed with regard to their tree species composition, growing stock and structure. The results were compared with data from two coppice and two <b>coppice</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> stands in Thuringia. T o our knowledge this is the first investigation of this forest type. One reason for this lack of information may be the lack of a management perspective for these stands. I n the mature stands a high number of tree species was recorded. In the farmers’ forest stands 14 species were detected, in the <b>coppice</b> and <b>coppice</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> stands up to 17. However, by analyzing the regeneration stratum, a future decline of species richness is apparent due to severe deer browsing by high ungulate populations. Species such as sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) are much more affected by browsing than European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). Compared to regularly managed forests, stand volume and basal area are high in the farmers’ forests (up to 805 m³ ha- 1 respectively 53 m² ha- 1). In the <b>coppice</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> stands the values range to 537 m³ ha- 1 (stand volume) and 44 m² ha- 1 (basal area), in the coppice stands to 500 m³ ha- 1 (stand volume) and 38 m² ha- 1 (basal area). For the description of species diversity the Evenness (Pielou 1966) was calculated. A mean of 0. 58 was calculated for the farmers’ forest. For the <b>coppice</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> and the <b>coppice</b> stands means of 0. 63 and 0. 66 were computed. The mean values for the diversity (Jost 2006, 2007) are 2. 86 (farmers’ forest), 3. 61 (<b>coppice</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards)</b> und 3. 75 (coppice). A clumped stand structure could be detected mainly in the <b>coppice</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> and <b>coppice</b> stands, whereas the stand structure in parts of the farmers’ forests was regular. The decline in species richness and the high growing stocks can be interpreted as the result of missing silvicultural interventions and insufficient hunting activities...|$|R

Coppicing is generally used to produce fuelwood, pulpwood, and other products dependent on small trees. A close relative of coppicing is pollarding.

50|$|This is {{semi-natural}} ancient woodland, {{which has}} been managed as coppice {{for hundreds of years}} (<b>coppice</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> management). Historically it has been a 'working wood' for timber production, either from mature trees (for ship building for example), or from coppice (for hurdle making and other uses). Some mature trees were removed from the site during the Second World War. Conifer and beech were planted in the 1950s as part of the then management plans, alongside the regeneration of other species following coppicing.|$|R
5000|$|Continuous cover {{forestry}} (commonly {{referred to}} as [...] "CCF") is an approach to the sustainable management of forests whereby forest stands are maintained in a permanently irregular structure, which is created and sustained through the selection and harvesting of individual trees. The term [...] "continuous cover forestry" [...] does not equate exactly to any one particular silvicultural system, but is typified by selection <b>systems.</b> For example <b>coppice</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> and Reiniger's Target diameter harvesting are also continuous cover forestry.

40|$|Summary &mdash; In Austria oak stands occupy an area {{covering}} &ap; 150 000 ha or &ap; 4 % of {{the total}} forest area. Half of the oak stands are managed as <b>coppice</b> or <b>coppice</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards,</b> and half are man-aged as high forest. During the last 2 decades {{there has been a}} remarkable increase in developing young oak stands. The interest in managing suitable forest areas for oak is apparently growing. Therefore regeneration methods, timely and proper management and thinning regimes will be very important in the near future. As a result of different growth performances it is necessary to determine different production targets and rotation cycles. For this reason treatment programmes have been developed dependent on selected sites considering biological, ecological and technical parameters to achieve high economic yield. Investigations into oak stands of different age classes have already shown the importance of timely cleaning, tending and continuous thinning during the first third of the rotation cycles. Various treatment programmes and practical knowledge relating to regeneration, tending, crop selection and thinning have been discussed. silviculture I oak / high forest <b>system</b> I <b>coppice</b> <b>with</b> <b>standards</b> I <b>coppice</b> Résumé&mdash; Méthodes de sylviculture du chêne en Autriche.
