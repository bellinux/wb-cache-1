5|$|Because of {{complaints}} from bar owners about {{their inability to}} obtain liability insurance, the state passed legislation in 1987 to limit liability to cases where the server could have realistically known that the patron was underage or intoxicated, and to limit lawsuits to types of injuries that are foreseeable. The act also instituted the legal standard of <b>comparative</b> <b>negligence</b> in these cases, wherein the monetary damages against a licensed establishment can be reduced if {{there are others who}} are also negligent (e.g. the patron, other bars). Additional legislation passed in 1987 substantially limited the liability of social hosts for adult guests.|$|E
5|$|While {{the courts}} in New Jersey allow actions based on dram shop {{liability}} or social host liability, they will instruct a jury to consider the intoxicated person's negligence under the doctrine of <b>comparative</b> <b>negligence.</b> Licensed establishments and social hosts may be liable for drunk driving accidents, assaults, falls, and other injuries and property damage caused by a customer, but are not liable for behavior which is unforeseeable (e.g. falling out of a tree), nor are they liable if they only served food or non-alcoholic beverages to a drunk patron. Dram shop and social host litigation may involve both compensatory and punitive damages. There is a 2-year statute of limitations for such lawsuits, but the time limit may be extended if the victim is a juvenile.|$|E
25|$|The law of torts {{for various}} jurisdictions has {{developed}} independently. In {{the case of}} the United States, a survey of trial lawyers pointed to several modern developments, including strict liability for products based on Greenman v.

However, there has also been a reaction in terms of tort reform, which in some cases have been struck down as violating state constitutions, and federal preemption of state laws.|$|E
40|$|This article investigates an apparent, {{convergent}} {{shift in}} common law jurisdictions {{away from the}} traditional principle of {{joint and several liability}} towards proportionate liability in cases involving multiple wrongdoers, and argues that this is best seen as an unprincipled drift. The shift is often presented by defendants and legislators as a logical extension of the ethics of <b>comparative</b> (contributory) <b>negligence</b> doctrine. Here we deny any ethical connection between the two doctrines. We also suggest that there is no good, generalisable ethical or pragmatic argument in favour of proportionate liability in its own right and caution jurisdictions currently considering reform of the joint and several liability rule against leaping to any such assumption...|$|R

40|$|All or nothing. For {{years this}} idea of absolutes has been a {{hallmark}} of tort law despite the inequities it has caused. Plaintiffs must either win a total victory or suffer total defeat. In recent years courts and legislatures have begun to recognize the injustice of the all-or-nothing approach and {{to replace it with}} rules that permit partial recoveries that are more equitably tailored to the particular facts of each case. The most dramatic example of this more equitable approach is the nearly universal rejection of contributory negligence in favor of <b>comparative</b> fault in <b>negligence</b> cases. Almost all jurisdictions, however, still refuse to use comparative fault when defendant is alleged to have committed an intentional tort; in that case, the all-or-nothing approach still prevails. Admittedly, the perpetrators of certain intentional torts should not benefit from comparative fault rules: why, for example, should a thief be able to avoid paying the full value of the items he stole by proving that the victim was careless in leaving her possessions unguarded? On the other hand, it takes little imagination to conceive of intentional tort situations in which resort to comparative fault is quite appealing. To use an example familiar to many law students, a defendant who, while legally hunting wolves, shoots at, hits, and kills plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s dog, which looks exactly like a wolf, has committed an intentional tort. The dog 2 ̆ 7 s owner may recover the full value of the dog even though defendant reasonably believed he was shooting a wolf. But what if the dog owner was negligent in releasing his wolf-like dog during wolf-hunting season? Why should this negligence be ignored in determining the extent of defendant 2 ̆ 7 s liability? Had defendant been negligent (suppose, for example, he aimed at a wolf but carelessly hit plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s dog), plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s fault in releasing the dog would have been used either to reduce defendant 2 ̆ 7 s liability or to bar plaintiff from all recovery. Although the equities favor the morally innocent intentional tort defendant over both this negligent defendant and the negligent plaintiff, the law presently insists that the intentional tort defendant pay the negligent plaintiff in full but allows the negligent defendant either to escape without any liability or to pay for only part of the damage. The thesis of this Article is that comparative fault ought to govern the liability of my hypothetical wolf hunter, as well as the liability of the other defendants mentioned above and other similarly situated intentional tortfeasors. The reasons for using comparative fault in many intentional tort cases are discussed in Part II. Part III considers the justifications that have been offered to support the refusal to use comparative fault in these cases and finds them wanting. A system for determining when the use of comparative fault is appropriate in intentional tort cases is explained in Part IV. Part V explores the administrative costs that might be {{associated with the use of}} comparative fault in these case...|$|R

2500|$|If {{the victim}} {{has contributed to}} causing their own harm through negligent or irresponsible actions, the damages may be reduced or {{eliminated}} entirely. The English case Butterfield v. Forrester (1809) established this defense. In England, this [...] "contributory negligence" [...] became a partial defense, but in the United States, any fault by the victim completely eliminated any damages. This meant that if the plaintiff was 1% at fault, the victim would lose the entire lawsuit. This was viewed as unnecessarily harsh and therefore amended to a <b>comparative</b> <b>negligence</b> system in many states; as of 2007 contributory negligence exists {{in only a few}} states such as North Carolina and Maryland.|$|E
2500|$|A twelve-person jury {{reached its}} verdict on August 18, 1994. [...] Applying the {{principles}} of <b>comparative</b> <b>negligence,</b> the jury found that McDonald's was 80% responsible for the incident and Liebeck was 20% at fault. Though there was a warning on the coffee cup, the jury decided that the warning was neither large enough nor sufficient. They awarded Liebeck $200,000 in compensatory damages, which was then reduced by 20% to $160,000. In addition, they awarded her $2.7 million in punitive damages. The jurors apparently arrived at this figure from Morgan's suggestion to penalize McDonald's {{for one or two}} days' worth of coffee revenues, which were about $1.35 million per day. The judge reduced punitive damages to $480,000, three times the compensatory amount, for a total of $640,000. The decision was appealed by both McDonald's and Liebeck in December 1994, but the parties settled out of court for an undisclosed amount less than $600,000.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. {{state of}} California has a {{system based on}} common law, but it has codified {{the law in the}} manner of the civil law jurisdictions.

The California courts have treated portions of the codes as an extension of the common-law tradition, subject to judicial development in the same manner as judge-made common law. (Most notably, in the case Li v. Yellow Cab Co., 13 Cal.3d 804 (1975), the California Supreme Court adopted the principle of <b>comparative</b> <b>negligence</b> in the face of a California Civil Code provision codifying the traditional common-law doctrine of contributory negligence.) ...|$|E

The Florida Supreme Court adopted the concept of “pure” <b>comparative</b> <b>negligence,</b> which allows a victim to be compensated for the percentage of harm caused by the at-fault person.

5000|$|In {{defense of}} such liabilities, {{autonomous}} vehicle manufacturers {{could make the}} argument of <b>comparative</b> <b>negligence,</b> product misuse and state of the art.

50|$|Neither <b>comparative</b> <b>negligence</b> nor {{contributory}} negligence should {{be confused with}} joint and several liability, which generally holds each {{of two or more}} culpable defendants responsible for all the damages sustained by a plaintiff. For practical reasons, a plaintiff who faces the defense of <b>comparative</b> <b>negligence</b> may wish to join all potentially culpable defendants in his action since the plaintiff's negligence will be balanced against the combined negligence of all defendants in apportioning damages even if the plaintiff may not be able actually to get compensation from some of them: for example, if an insolvent individual and a major corporation were both negligent in causing plaintiff's harm.|$|E
50|$|Comparative {{responsibility}} (known as comparative {{fault in}} some jurisdictions) is {{a doctrine of}} tort law that compares the fault of each party in a lawsuit for a single injury.

50|$|In jurisdictions {{that employ}} this less rigid {{formulation}} of exclusive control, the element subsumes the element that the plaintiff {{did not contribute}} to his injury. In modern case law, contributory negligence is compared to the injury caused by the other. For example, if the negligence of the other is 95% of {{the cause of the}} plaintiff's injury, and the plaintiff is 5% responsible, the plaintiff's slight fault cannot negate the negligence of the other. The new type of split liability is commonly called <b>comparative</b> <b>negligence.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The other variant allows plaintiffs {{to recover}} [...] "only if" [...] the plaintiff's {{negligence}} is [...] "not as great as" [...] the defendant's (the plaintiff's negligence must {{be less than}} 50% of the combined negligence). The apparently minor {{difference between the two}} modified forms of <b>comparative</b> <b>negligence</b> is thought by lawyers handling such cases to be significant, as juries who ordinarily assign degrees of fault are much less willing to award damages to a plaintiff who is equally at fault than to one who is less at fault than the defendant.|$|E

50|$|Within {{the federal}} legal systems of several common-law countries, and most {{especially}} the United States, {{it is relatively}} common for the distinct lower-level judicial systems (e.g. state courts in the United States and Australia, provincial courts in Canada) to regard the decisions of other jurisdictions within the same country as persuasive precedent. Particularly in the United States, {{the adoption of a}} legal doctrine by a large number of other state judiciaries is regarded as highly persuasive evidence that such doctrine is preferred. A good example is the adoption in Tennessee of <b>comparative</b> <b>negligence</b> (replacing contributory negligence as a complete bar to recovery) by the 1992 Tennessee Supreme Court decision McIntyre v. Balentine (by this point all US jurisdictions save Tennessee, five other states, and the District of Columbia had adopted <b>comparative</b> <b>negligence</b> schemes). Moreover, in American law, the Erie doctrine requires federal courts sitting in diversity actions to apply state substantive law, but {{in a manner consistent with}} how the court believes the state's highest court would rule in that case. Since such decisions are not binding on state courts, but are often very well-reasoned and useful, state courts cite federal interpretations of state law fairly often as persuasive precedent, although it is also fairly common for a state high court to reject a federal court's interpretation of its jurisprudence.|$|E

Indiana applies pure contributory negligence to medical malpractice cases and tort claims against governmental entities.
