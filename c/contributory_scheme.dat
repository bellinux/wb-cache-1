40|$|The article {{traces the}} post-war {{history of the}} British {{hospital}} <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes,</b> which had developed during the inter-war years to the point where, through the accumulation of small weekly contributions from a mass membership, they provided substantial proportions of hospital income. A minority of <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes</b> remained in existence post- 1948, but their subsequent development has received little attention. Some evolved into provident associations offering private health insurance; others remained committed to the provision of low-cost benefits to a blue-collar clientele, and continued {{to be known as}} hospital <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes.</b> This article outlines the principal features of the contributory schemes' contemporary history. We first explore why many schemes decided to continue in existence. The next section uses national and individual scheme records to delineate the market niche which they captured and to investigate their role in post-war health provision, relative to the state system. In particular we trace the decline of convalescent home benefit, and the gradual trend towards a more uniform benefit package, of which optical and dental grants were the most popular. We then survey patterns of membership and account for the main trends in support for cash plan products since 1950. Finally, we ask to what extent the schemes were able to retain their character as a ‘movement’ with distinctive mutualist and charitable features, particularly in the more competitive environment of the later twentieth century...|$|R
40|$|Summary: In {{the context}} of {{developments}} in health care arrangements over {{the late nineteenth and}} twentieth centuries, change in the voluntary hospitals is not normally regarded as a major theme. Yet in their relations with each other, with external authorities, and in patterns of funding the hospitals were subjected to change. In particular, the growth of hospital <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes</b> enabled renewed hospital expansion to occur and established a quasi-insurance basis to hospital activity in place of the earlier, largely philanthropic approach. The schemes also involved additional market mechanisms and promoted reorganization, including a degree of co-ordination of hospital services, felt at the local level before the growth of policy making bodies on a national scale and largely independent of central or local government. Focusing upon East Anglia but including other examples, the article examines the growth of hospital collections, the emergence of <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes</b> and their consequences for popular access to hospital facilities. A 'grass roots' approach is adopted, using annual reports of several hospitals and <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes</b> and local Insurance Committee minutes. It appears that the size and impact of the schemes in East Anglia has been understated, though this may not be typical of the situation nationally. The local evidence is also examined in the light of other recent research on the themes of popular participation, employer interest and social control aspects in health care provision at hospital levels. © 1992 The Society for the Social History of Medicine...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} the discussion and rejection {{of a social}} insurance model of funding for the British National Health Service. Specifically it asks why the hospital <b>contributory</b> <b>scheme</b> movement had so little impact on policy debates in the 1940 s. We argue that {{at the start of}} the policy-making process serious consideration was given to the incorporation of this mode of funding, not least because the contributory schemes, with some ten million members, played a major role in financing existing voluntary hospital provision. Early sections describe the growth and nature of the schemes, noting that, despite their large working-class constituency and the presence of labour movement representatives amongst their leadership, they remained peripheral to discussion of reform in the interwar period. We then trace the emergence of the proposal for an insurance-based ‘hotel charge’ in civil servants' discussions about hospital funding following the Beveridge Report. Officials, however, remained sceptical about the contributory schemes' capacity to deliver a comprehensive and efficient funding mechanism, given their lack of uniformity, the gaps in their coverage, and the limited progress of reciprocal arrangements between them. Finally, we note the ineffectiveness of the British Hospital Contributory Schemes Association as a player in the policy community. Its leadership had no clear strategy for influencing events and was reluctant to deploy pressure group tactics such as lobbying through the press or parliament. Crucially, the movement was divided internally between those members who supported the voluntary system and others who welcomed a publicly funded health service...|$|E
40|$|South Africa developed, {{during the}} course of the twentieth century, an {{exceptional}} welfare system based on social assistance rather than social insurance, and focused especially on old-age pensions.   The origins of South Africa’s welfare state lay in the 1920 s, not in the 1930 s as has generally been suggested.   This paper examines the process leading to the 1928 Old Age Pensions Act, paying particular attention to the 1926 - 28 Pienaar Commission on Old Age Pensions and National Insurance.   The introduction of old age pensions enjoyed the support of all parties representing white and coloured voters in Parliament, but for diverse reasons.   For the National Party and Labour Party – partners in the coalition Pact Government of 1924 - 29 – non-contributory old-age pensions were a crucial pillar in the ‘civilised labour’ policies designed to lift ‘poor whites’ out of poverty and re-establish a clear racial hierarchy.   Welfare reform was thus, in significant part, a response to the ‘swartgevaar’ or menace of black physical, occupational and social mobility.   The choice of a system of tax-financed social assistance, in preference to a system of social insurance financed out of contributions by employers and workers, was due to a combination of factors: the perceived need to provide immediate redress against poverty and unemployment (motivating the National Party); the powerful influence of left and liberal thinking from Britain, Australia and New Zealand (on both bureaucrats and the Labour Party); a concern that <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes</b> would add to much to the costs of production (among employers and workers alike); and a worry about the racial coverage of <b>contributory</b> <b>schemes...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the year}} 2008, Chile {{brought in a}} {{comprehensive}} reform of its pension system, the main change being {{the introduction of a}} New Solidarity Pillar designed to eliminate the incidence of poverty among elderly adults. This new program sets a floor of around 50 % of a minimum monthly income for the poorest 60 % of the population by means of noncontributory benefits for people without pension rights and a solidarity top-up payment for people who have not accumulated enough in the way of pension rights. Although special attention was given {{in the design of the}} new scheme to minimize the adverse effects on incentives to take part in the <b>contributory</b> <b>scheme,</b> the theory suggests that both the level of benefits and the gradual reduction of these, conditional upon the selffunded pension, could affect contributory participation. On the one hand, greater future wealth is likely to reduce the incentive to save in the present (income effect); this effect is magnified by the fact that the future subsidy is partially reduced if the person saved more in the present (substitution effect). Internationally, however, there is little empirical evidence about the real impact of these effects on people’s behavior with regard to pensions. The Chilean reform could constitute an opportunity to measure these effects in a real case. This paper describes the main characteristics of the solidarity pillar, the background that gave rise to its creation, presents some preliminary results of the program in terms of beneficiaries and amounts, and discusses the theoretical effects on incentives to pay into the contributory system, relative to the poverty-prevention schemes that were present prior to the reform...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the particular}} {{case of the}} bankruptcy of the biggest public insurer in the Colombian Health insurance system (contributory regime) {{in order to identify}} some selection atterns within such an insurance market. Using both cross-section and built-in panel data from DANE Quality of Life Survey in two waves (1997 and 2003) and applying an empirical approach based on binary choice models, the paper tries to solve two main questions. The first one is whether exists empirical evidence about advantageous selection in the <b>contributory</b> <b>scheme</b> of Colombian health insurance system. Secondly, I tried to establish whether cream-skimming (if existed) had real influence in the bankruptcy of the Colombian public insurer, which also would imply failures in the risk-adjustment formula. In the final section the principles of a good riskadjustment system suitable for the local scenario are drafted. The results show a strong evidence of dynamic selection from 1997 to 2003, which could take place by favoring both favorable age load" and good socio economic status (income, education, work type and location) for private insurers. No evidence of selection based on household analysis was found, which reinforces the idea of an individual appraisal before enrollment. This situation affected the financial performance of the public insurance, but by no means was the definitive factor of the bankruptcy. On the other hand, the risk adjustment formula used in the Colombian system presents some theoretical flaws and stillis established upon information from fifteen years ago. However, without updated information on morbidity and health care usage (not available) is not possible to measure the quantitative extent of such failures in an accurate manner"Adverse selection, cream-skimming, Colombian health insurancesystem, risk adjustment, binary choice models. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} use of {{different}} healthcare levels, and its determinants, in two different health systems, the General System of Social Security in Health (GSSSH) and the Unified Health System (UHS) in municipalities in Colombia and Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out, based on a population survey in two municipalities in Colombia (n= 2163) and two in Brazil (n= 2155). Outcome variables consisted of {{the use of}} primary care services, outpatient secondary care services, and emergency care in the previous 3 months. Explanatory variables were need and predisposing and enabling factors. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed by healthcare level and country. RESULTS: The determinants of use differed by healthcare level and country: having a chronic disease was associated with a greater use of primary and outpatient secondary care in Colombia, and was also {{associated with the use of}} emergency care in Brazil. In Colombia, persons enrolled in the <b>contributory</b> <b>scheme</b> more frequently used the services of the GSSSH than persons enrolled with subsidized contributions in primary and outpatient secondary care and more than persons without insurance in any healthcare level. In Brazil, the low-income population and those without private insurance more frequently used the UHS at any level. In both countries, the use of primary care was increased when persons knew the healthcare center to which they were assigned and if they had a regular source of care. Knowledge of the referral hospital increased the use of outpatient secondary care and emergency care.
