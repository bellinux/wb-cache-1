GT is a powerful tool both {{for the study of}} gene function and for molecular breeding. However, in transformation of higher plants, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) occurs overwhelmingly in somatic <b>cells,</b> <b>masking</b> HR-mediated GT. Positive-negative selection (PNS) is an approach for finding HR-mediated GT events because it can eliminate NHEJ effectively by expression of a negative-selection marker gene. In rice—a major crop worldwide—reproducible PNS-mediated GT of endogenous genes has now been successfully achieved. The procedure is based on strong PNS using diphtheria toxin A-fragment as a negative marker, and has succeeded in the directed modification of several endogenous rice genes in various ways. In addition to gene knock-outs and knock-ins, a nucleotide substitution in a target gene was also achieved recently. This review presents a summary of the development of the rice PNS system, highlighting its advantages.

Host tissue response elicited against P. karlssoni ranged from focal encapsulation by haemocytes to formation of abscesses filled with ceroid-containing cells. The coccidian was restricted to the kidney in light infections and occurred within the renal cells and the lumen of the renal tubules. In heavy infections the coccidian also occurred in the mantle, digestive gland, intestine, gill and gonad. There was no apparent host response elicited against the coccidian parasite regardless of the tissue in which it occurred or whether the parasite was intra- or intercellular.

40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc 13, Yku, and {{telomerase}} define three parallel pathways for telomere end protection that prevent chromosome instability and death by senescence. We report here that cdc 13 - 1 yku 70 Δ mutants generated telomere deprotection-resistant cells that, {{in contrast with}} telomerase-negative senescent cells, did not display classical crisis events. cdc 13 - 1 yku 70 Δ cells survived telomere deprotection by exclusively amplifying TG 1 - 3 repeats (type II recombination). In a background lacking telomerase (tlc 1 Δ), this process predominated over type I recombination (amplification of subtelomeric Y′ sequences). Strikingly, inactivation of the Rad 50 /Rad 59 pathway (which is normally required for type II recombination) in cdc 13 - 1 yku 70 Δ or yku 70 Δ tlc 1 Δ mutants, but also in cdc 13 - 1 YKU 70 + tlc 1 Δ mutants, still permitted type II recombination, but this process was now entirely dependent on the Rad 51 pathway. In addition, delayed senescence was observed in cdc 13 - 1 yku 70 Δ rad 51 Δ and cdc 13 - 1 tlc 1 Δ rad 51 Δ cells. These results demonstrate that in wild-type <b>cells,</b> <b>masking</b> by Cdc 13 and Yku prevents the Rad 51 pathway from amplifying telomeric TG 1 - 3 sequences.

Morphologically, RBCs are largely homogeneous, and most of the functional studies have been performed on large populations of <b>cells,</b> <b>masking</b> putative cellular variations. We studied human and mouse RBCs by live-cell video imaging, which allowed single cells to be followed over time. In particular we analysed functional responses to hormonal stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a signalling molecule occurring in blood plasma, with the Ca(2 +) sensor Fluo- 4. Additionally, we developed an approach for analysing the Ca(2 +) responses of RBCs that allowed the quantitative characterization of single-cell signals. In RBCs, the LPA-induced Ca(2 +) influx showed substantial diversity in both kinetics and amplitude. Also the age-classification was determined for each particular RBC and consecutively analysed. While reticulocytes lack a Ca(2 +) response to LPA stimulation, old RBCs approaching clearance generated robust LPA-induced signals, which still displayed broad heterogeneity. Observing phospatidylserine exposure as an effector mechanism of intracellular Ca(2 +) revealed an even increased heterogeneity of RBC responses. The functional diversity of RBCs needs {{to be taken into account}} in future studies, which will increasingly require single-cell analysis approaches. The identified heterogeneity in RBC responses is important for the basic understanding of RBC signalling and their contribution to numerous diseases, especially with respect to Ca(2 +) influx and the associated pro-thrombotic activity...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{that the effects of}} low oxygen tensions in cultures of human adipose stromal cells (hASC) range from increased cell death to changes in proliferation and differentiation potential. Specifically, hypoxia-induced autophagy promotes cell survival as result of Hypoxia Inducible Factor- 1 Î± activation and downstream signalling. In the present project, we intended to verify the existence of a correlation between the levels of hypoxia-induced autophagy and changes in the differentiation potential of hASC sheets. Cell sheets (CS) of hASC were produced and cultured in normoxic and hypoxic conditions (5 % O 2) for 1 to 4 days. At each time point, samples were collected for western blot and qPCR analysis or further cultured in osteogenic or adipogenic medium. Gene expression analysis of LC 3, ULK 1, BECLIN 1 and ATG 5 revealed overexpression of these autophagy players at day 4, independently of the culture oxygen tension. LC 3 II protein quantification revealed an increase in the autophagic flux at day 4, regardless of the oxygen tension, confirming the qPCR data. This suggests that the state of hyperconfluency of CS, increasing from day 1 to 4, may modulate the autophagic state of <b>cells,</b> <b>masking</b> the effects of low-oxygen tensions. Importantly, CS cultured in hypoxia for 4 days had increased osteogenic differentiation in comparison with day 1 hypoxic samples but decreased adipogenic differentiation, which hints at a possible correlation between higher levels of autophagy and a tendency towards the osteogenic phenotype. This hypothesis is being confirmed using autophagy modulators...|$|E

40|$|The best-understood {{mechanisms}} for achieving antibody self/nonself discrimination discard self-reactive antibodies {{before they can}} be tested for binding microbial antigens, potentially creating holes in the repertoire. Here we provide evidence for a complementary mechanism: retaining autoantibodies in the repertoire displayed as low levels of IgM and high IgD on anergic B <b>cells,</b> <b>masking</b> a varying proportion of autoantibody-binding sites with carbohydrates, and removing their self-reactivity by somatic hypermutation and selection in germinal centers (GCs). Analysis of human antibody sequences by deep sequencing of isotype-switched memory B cells or in IgG antibodies elicited against allogeneic RhD+ erythrocytes, vaccinia virus, rotavirus, or tetanus toxoid provides evidence for reactivation of anergic IgMlow IgD+ IGHV 4 - 34 + B cells and removal of cold agglutinin self-reactivity by hypermutation, often accompanied by mutations that inactivated an N-linked glycosylation sequon in complementarity-determining region 2 (CDR 2). In a Hy 10 antibody transgenic model where anergic B cells respond to a biophysically defined lysozyme epitope displayed on both foreign and self-antigens, cell transfers revealed that anergic IgMlow IgD+ B cells form twice as many GC progeny as naïve IgMhi IgD+ counterparts. Their GC progeny were rapidly selected for CDR 2 mutations that blocked 72 % of antigen-binding sites with N-linked glycan, decreased affinity 100 -fold, and then cleared the binding sites of blocking glycan. These results provide evidence for a mechanism to acquire self/non-self discrimination by somatic mutation away from self-reactivity, and reveal how varying the efficiency of N-glycosylation provides a mechanism to modulate antibody avidity...|$|E
40|$|We review how polyreactive natural IgM autoantibodies (IgM-NAA) {{protect the}} host from invading {{micro-organisms}} and host neo-antigens that {{are constantly being}} produced by oxidation mechanisms and cell apoptosis. Secondly, we discuss how IgM-NAA and IgM-ALA inhibits auto-immune inflammation by anti-idiotypic mechanisms, enhancing removal of apoptotic <b>cells,</b> <b>masking</b> neo-antigens and regulating the function of dendritic cells (DC) and effector cells. Thirdly, we review how natural IgM prevents autoimmune disorders arising from pathogenic IgG autoantibodies, triggered by genetic mechanisms (e. g. SLE) or micro-organisms, {{as well as by}} auto reactive B and T cells that have escaped tolerance mechanisms. Studies in IgM knockout mice have clearly demonstrated that regulatory B and T cells require IgM to effectively regulate inflammation mediated by innate, adaptive and auto-immune mechanisms. It is therefore not surprising why the host positively selects such autoreactive B 1 cells that generate protective IgM-NAA, which are also evolutionarily conserved. Fourthly, we show that IgM-ALA levels and repertoire can vary in normal humans and disease states and this variation may partly explain the observed differences in the inflammatory response after infection, ischemic injury or after a transplant. We also show how protective IgM-NAA can be rendered pathogenic under non-physiological conditions. We also review IgG-NAA that are more abundant than IgM-NAA in plasma. However, we need to understand if the (Fab) 2 region of IgG-NAA has physiological relevance in non-disease states, as in plasma, their functional activity is blocked by IgM-NAA having anti-idiotypic activity. Some IgG NAA are produced by B 2 cells that have escaped tolerance mechanisms and we show how such pathogenic IgG-NAA are regulated to prevent autoimmune disease. The Fc region of IgG-NAA can influence inflammation and B cell function in-vivo by binding to activating and inhibitory FcR. IgM-NAA has therapeutic potential. Polyclonal IgM infusions can be used to abrogate on-going inflammation. Additionally, inflammation arising after ischemia induced kidney injury e. g. during high-risk elective cardiac surgery or after allograft transplantation, can be abrogated by pre-emptively infusing polyclonal IgM or DC pretreated ex-vivo with IgM or by increasing in-vivo IgM with a vaccine approach. Cell therapy is appealing as less IgM will be required...|$|E

40|$|Mouse peritoneal macrophages {{possess a}} {{specific}} plasma membrane receptor for antibody-coated particles. Sheep red cells coated with rabbit 7 S antibody attach readily to the macrophage surface and are subsequently interiorized. The fusion of macrophage with nonphagocytic mouse melanoma cells produces heterokaryons {{in which the}} macrophage receptor is drastically altered. The receptor is present shortly after fusion and heterokaryons are actively phagocytic. The ability to bind and ingest red cells is, however, progressively lost over the next 12 – 24 hr and does not reappear thereafter. Exposure of heterokaryons to trypsin (1 – 100 µg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C) results in the reappearance of initial receptor activity and the unmasking of the surface receptor. This property is again lost upon subsequent cultivation. The masking process takes place when cells are cultivated {{in the absence of}} IgG so that the adsorption of antibody from the medium is not responsible for this phenomenon. Inhibition of heterokaryon protein synthesis preserves phagocytic activity in a reversible fashion and prevents the masking of macrophage receptors. Inhibition of melanoma RNA synthesis before fusion is also able to block subsequent masking, but is ineffective if delayed until after fusion. Ultraviolet irradiation of the melanoma cell before fusion prevents subsequent masking, whereas similar treatment of the macrophage has no effect. Cells differ markedly in their ability to mask the macrophage phagocytic receptor after fusion.

40|$|Measles {{remains a}} {{significant}} childhood disease, and {{is associated with}} a transient immune suppression. Paradoxically, measles virus (MV) infection also induces robust MV-specific immune responses. Current hypotheses for the mechanism underlying measles immune suppression focus on functional impairment of lymphocytes or antigen-presenting cells, caused by infection with or exposure to MV. We have generated stable recombinant MVs that express enhanced green fluorescent protein, and remain virulent in non-human primates. By performing a comprehensive study of virological, immunological, hematological and histopathological observations made in animals euthanized at different time points after MV infection, we developed a model explaining measles immune suppression which fits with the "measles paradox". Here we show that MV preferentially infects CD 45 RA(-) memory T-lymphocytes and follicular B-lymphocytes, resulting in high infection levels in these populations. After the peak of viremia MV-infected lymphocytes were cleared within days, followed by immune activation and lymph node enlargement. During this period tuberculin-specific T-lymphocyte responses disappeared, whilst strong MV-specific T-lymphocyte responses emerged. Histopathological analysis of lymphoid tissues showed lymphocyte depletion in the B- and T-cell areas in the absence of apoptotic cells, paralleled by infiltration of T-lymphocytes into B-cell follicles and reappearance of proliferating cells. Our findings indicate an immune-mediated clearance of MV-infected CD 45 RA(-) memory T-lymphocytes and follicular B-lymphocytes, which causes temporary immunological amnesia. The rapid oligoclonal expansion of MV-specific lymphocytes and bystander <b>cells</b> <b>masks</b> this depletion, explaining the short duration of measles lymphopenia yet long duration of immune suppression...|$|R

However, few of the current freely-available bioimage analysis software tools are optimized for efficient handling of these images. Even fewer of them are designed to transform the phenotypic features measured from these images into discriminative profiles that can reveal biologically meaningful associations among the tested perturbations. Results: We present a fast and user-friendly software platform called “cellXpress “ to segment cells, measure quantitative features of cellular phenotypes, construct discriminative profiles, and visualize the resulting <b>cell</b> <b>masks</b> and feature values. We have also developed a suite of library functions to load the extracted features for further customizable analysis and visualization under the R computing environment. We systematically compared the processing speed, cell segmentation accuracy, and phenotypic-profile clustering performance of cellXpress to other existing bioimage analysis software packages or algorithms.

A procedure has been designed that is capable of operating on matrices of elevation data having no algorithmically imposed size limit, while performing within the resolution and accuracy tolerances of the DEM data. Each cell is processed as the center of a 3 - by 3 -cell spatial window in the raster elevation data. If a cell is a local minimum in comparison with two of its non-adjacent neighbors, it is labeled as a drainage cell. The linkages of the drainage cells within user-specified distance and elevation thresholds are established in a separate pro cess. The products of these processing steps are digital masks of the drainage cells and the watershed basins, both in raster format. A drainage <b>cell</b> <b>mask</b> derived using this procedure is use ful in computing slope values for a raster data base. Slope has traditionally been calculated for each cell by fitting a plane through the eight nearest cells. However, if the terrain represented by these cells is V-shaped, such as a gully, a plane does not fit well; in fact, the desired slope value is the slope along the bottom of the gully, regardless of the steepness of the gully sides. The automated drainage process will label such a cell as a drainage cell, and its slope can then be computed from the elevation values of neighboring drainage cells...|$|R

Tight Junctions (TJ) are located between the cancer epithelial cells and between the endothelial cells functioning in an adhesive manner. They represent a critical barrier which the cancer cells must overcome in order to penetrate and initiate metastasis. Claudin- 5 is a protein member of the Claudin family, a group of TJ proteins expressed in both endothelial and epithelial cells. This study examined in vitro the effect of altering levels of expression of Claudin- 5 in HECV cells. Insertion of Claudin- 5 gene in HECV cells resulted in cells that were significantly less motile and less adhesive to matrix (P < 0. 001). These cells also exhibited a significant decreased in the angiogenic potential (P < 0. 001). Results also revealed a link between Claudin- 5 and cell motility. Furthermore, a possible link between Claudin- 5 and N-WASP, and Claudin- 5 and ROCK was demonstrated when interactions between these proteins were seen in the cell line. Moreover, followed by treatment of N-WASP inhibitor (Wiskostatin) and ROCK inhibitor (Y- 27632), cell motility and angiogenic potential were assessed {{in response to the}} inhibitors. Results showed that the knockdown of Claudin- 5 in HECV <b>cells</b> <b>masked</b> their response to both N-WASP and ROCK inhibitors.

The oncogenic role of beta-catenin is well defined but reasons for its accumulation in HCC remain unclear. Dickkopf 4 (DKK 4) acts as a negative regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway but its functional role in liver carcinogenesis has not been studied. We investigated the role of DKK 4 in beta-catenin regulation in HCC. Reduced expression of DKK 4 was found in 47 % (38 / 81) of HCC, as measured by quantitative real time PCR. Ectopic expression of DKK 4 in two HCC cell lines, PLC/PRF/ 5 (PLC) and MHCC 97 L (97 L), attenuated beta-catenin responsive luciferase activity, and decreased both beta-catenin and cyclin D 1 protein levels. To study the effect of DKK 4 on cell growth and tumourigenicity, two stable HCC cell lines were established from PLC and 97 L cells. Functional assays demonstrated that overexpression of DKK 4 hampered cell proliferation, reduced colony formation and retarded cell migration. When DKK 4 -expressing 97 L stable cells were used to induce tumour xenografts in nude mice (n= 8), reduction in tumour sizes was observed (P= 0. 027). Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies showed that decreased expression of DKK 4 was associated with beta-catenin accumulation in HCC tissues. Additionally, inhibition of the proteasome using specific inhibitor in DKK 4 -expressing 97 L stable <b>cells</b> <b>masked</b> the effect of beta-catenin.

To determine whether the Bcg allele could affect in vivo the antibody response to antigens not related to mycobacterial infections, we tested the primary and secondary responses to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and glycosylated bovine insulin (G-insulin) in two pairs of Bcg congenic strains: BALB/c (Bcgs) versus BALB/c. CD 2 (Bcgr), and B 10. A (Bcgs) versus B 10 Ar (Bcgr), and in C 57 BL/ 10 ScSn (B 10; Bcgs) and A/J (Bcgr) mice. Furthermore, the antigen-specific proliferative responses of T cells primed in vivo by protein antigens were also tested in Bcg congenic mice. We found {{no significant difference in}} in vivo antibody response either to SRBC or G-insulin between the Bcgr and Bcgs strains. The magnitude of in vitro antigen-specific proliferation of lymph node cells sensitized in vivo by hen egg lysozyme (HEL) or chicken ovalbumin (OVA) was also similar in Bcgs and Bcgr congenic mice. However, we have documented a higher antigen-presenting capacity of Bcgr macrophages in in vitro antigen-specific proliferation to OVA. Since the macrophages are the only cells in which the Nramp 1 gene is expressed, we suggest that the activity of other types of antigen-presenting <b>cells</b> <b>masks</b> the effect of the Bcgr allele on antigen-presentation in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Background Siglec- 7, a sialic acid binding {{inhibitory}} receptor {{expressed by}} NK <b>cells</b> is <b>masked</b> in vivo by a so far unknown ligand. It shows a strong binding prevalence for α- 2, 8 -linked disialic acids in vitro. Results Here {{we describe the}} expression of PSA-NCAM (α- 2, 8 -linked polysialic acid modified NCAM) on functional adult peripheral blood natural killer cells and examine its possible role in masking Siglec- 7. Unmasking of Siglec- 7 using Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase massively reduces NK cell cytotoxicity. By contrast a specific removal of PSA using Endo-NF {{does not lead to}} a reduction of NK cell cytotoxicity. Conclusion The results presented here therefore indicate that PSA-NCAM is not involved in masking Siglec- 7...|$|R
40|$|One unique subtype of retinal {{ganglion}} cell is {{the direction}} selective (DS) cell, which responds vigorously to stimulus movement in a preferred direction, but weakly to {{movement in the}} opposite or null direction. Here we show that the application of the GABA receptor blocker picrotoxin unmasks a robust excitatory OFF response in ON DS ganglion cells. Similar to the characteristic ON response of ON DS <b>cells,</b> the <b>masked</b> OFF response is also direction selective, but its preferred direction is opposite to that of the ON component. Given that the OFF response is unmasked with picrotoxin, its direction selectivity cannot be generated by a GABAergic mechanism. Alternatively, we find that the direction selectivity of the OFF response is blocked by cholinergic drugs, suggesting that acetylcholine release from presynaptic starburst amacrine cells is crucial for its generation. Finally, we find that the OFF response is abolished by application of a gap junction blocker, suggesting that it arises from electrical synapses between ON DS and polyaxonal amacrine cells. Our results suggest a novel role for gap junctions in mixing excitatory ON and OFF signals at the ganglion cell level. We propose that OFF inputs to ON DS <b>cells</b> are normally <b>masked</b> by a GABAergic inhibition, but are unmasked under certain stimulus conditions to mediate optokinetic signals in the brain...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{explore the}} role of c-Myc in carcinogenesis, we have {{developed}} a reversible transgenic model of pancreatic β cell oncogenesis using a switchable form of the c-Myc protein. Activation of c-Myc in adult, mature β cells induces uniform β cell proliferation but is accompanied by overwhelming apoptosis that rapidly erodes β cell mass. Thus, the oncogenic potential of c-Myc in β <b>cells</b> is <b>masked</b> by apoptosis. Upon suppression of c-Myc-induced β cell apoptosis by coexpression of Bcl-xL, c-Myc triggers rapid and uniform progression into angiogenic, invasive tumors. Subsequent c-Myc deactivation induces rapid regression associated with vascular degeneration and β cell apoptosis. Our data indicate that highly complex neoplastic lesions can be both induced and maintained in vivo by a simple combination of two interlocking molecular lesions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe human {{cytomegalovirus}} glycoprotein, UL 16, binds to {{two members}} of a novel family of molecules, the ULBPs, and to the MHC class I homolog, MICB. The ULBPs are GPI-linked glycoproteins belonging to the extended MHC class I family but are only distantly related to MICB. The ULBP and MICB molecules are ligands for the activating receptor, NKG 2 D/DAP 10, and this interaction is blocked by a soluble form of UL 16. The ULBPs stimulate cytokine and chemokine production from NK cells, and expression of ULBPs in NK cell–resistant target cells confers susceptibility to NK <b>cell</b> cytotoxicity. <b>Masking</b> of NK <b>cell</b> recognition of ULBP or MIC antigens by UL 16 provides a potential mechanism by which human cytomegalovirus–infected cells might evade attack by the immune system...|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} role of the amino-terminal domain of the desmin subunit in {{intermediate}} filament (IF) formation, several deletions in the sequence encoding this domain were made. The deleted hamster desmin genes were fused to the RSV promoter. Expression of such constructs in vimentin- free MCF- 7 cells as well as in vimentin-containing HeLa cells, resulted in the synthesis of mutant proteins of the expected size. Single- and double-label immunofluorescence assays of transfected cells showed that in the absence of vimentin, desmin subunits missing amino acids 4 - 13 are still capable of filament formation, although in addition to filaments large numbers of desmin dots are present. Mutant desmin subunits missing larger portions of their amino terminus cannot form filaments on their own. It may be concluded that the amino-terminal region comprising amino acids 7 - 17 contains residues indispensable for desmin filament formation in vivo. Furthermore it was shown that the endogenous vimentin IF network in HeLa <b>cells</b> <b>masks</b> the effects of mutant desmin on IF assembly. Intact and mutant desmin colocalized completely with endogenous vimentin in HeLa cells. Surprisingly, in these cells endogenous keratin also seemed to colocalize with endogenous vimentin, even if the endogenous vimentin filaments were disturbed after expression of some of the mutant desmin proteins. In MCF- 7 cells some overlap between endogenous keratin and intact exogenous desmin filaments was also observed, but mutant desmin proteins did not affect the keratin IF structures. In the absence of vimentin networks (MCF- 7 cells), the initiation of desmin filament formation seems to start on the preexisting keratin filaments. However, in the presence of vimentin (HeLa cells) a gradual integration of desmin in the preexisting vimentin filaments apparently takes place...|$|R
