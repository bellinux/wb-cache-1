5|$|The Little Mermaid vigorously relaunched a {{profound}} {{new interest in}} the animation and musical film genres. The film {{was also the first}} to feature the use of Disney's <b>Computer</b> <b>Animation</b> Production System (CAPS). Developed for Disney by Pixar, which had grown into a commercial <b>computer</b> <b>animation</b> and technology development company, CAPS would become significant in allowing future Disney films to more seamlessly integrate computer-generated imagery and achieve higher production values with digital ink and paint and compositing techniques. The Little Mermaid was {{the first of a series}} of blockbusters that would be released over the next decade by Walt Disney Feature Animation, a period later designated by the term Disney Renaissance.|$|E

5|$|The Black Cauldron was {{intended}} to expand the appeal of Disney animated films to older audiences and to showcase the talents of {{the new generation of}} Disney animators from CalArts. Besides Keane, Musker, and Clements, this new group of artists included other promising animators such as Andreas Deja, Mike Gabriel, John Lasseter, and Tim Burton. Lasseter was fired from Disney in 1983 for pushing the studio to explore <b>computer</b> <b>animation</b> production, but {{went on to become the}} creative head of Pixar, a pioneering <b>computer</b> <b>animation</b> studio that would begin a close association with Disney in the late 1980s. Similarly, Burton was fired in 1984 after producing a live-action short shelved by the studio, Frankenweenie, then went on to become a high-profile producer and director of live-action and stop-motion features for Disney and other studios. Some of Burton's high-profile projects for Disney would include the stop-motion The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), a live-action adaptation of Alice in Wonderland (2010), and a stop-motion feature remake of Frankenweenie (2012).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Since their {{introduction}} into schools, {{educators have}} tried to utilize computers in classes {{in order to make}} difficult topics more comprehensible. Chemistry educators, when faced with the task of teaching a topic that cannot be taught through experiments in a laboratory, resort to computers to help students visualize difficult concepts and processes. Computers offer viable means to teach dynamic equilibrium, a topic that has no laboratory manuals. Recently, chemistry educators have started to focus on how to use <b>computer</b> <b>animations</b> and simulations in the teaching of equilibrium. KEYWORDS.

5|$|With the {{scarcity}} of Los Angeles-based animators willing to move their families so far north, give up traditional animation, and try <b>computer</b> <b>animation,</b> Pixar's new hires at this time either came directly from college or had worked outside feature animation. For those who had traditional animation skills, the Pixar animation software Marionette was designed so that traditional animators would require a minimum amount of training before becoming productive.|$|E
5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after The Rescuers Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (<b>Computer</b> <b>Animation</b> Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar. The software allowed for {{a wider range of}} colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E

5|$|In the {{production}} of the music video, Miyazaki experimented with using <b>computer</b> <b>animation</b> to supplement traditional hand drawn cell-animation. At the time Studio Ghibli did not have its own computer department and the work was outsourced to CG Production Company Links, under supervision of Hideki Nakano. Techniques learned in the experimentation for On Your Mark were later adopted for the creation of Princess Mononoke. Animation director was Masashi Andō. Long time Miyazaki collaborator Michiyo Yasuda was in charge of colour selection. Backgrounds were created by Kazuo Oga. Yōji Takeshige made his debut as Art Director. There is no dialogue in the music video and the two policemen are loosely modeled after Chage and Aska.|$|E

5|$|Like other Japanese anime, The Garden of Words {{was created}} using a {{combination}} of hand-drawn animation, rotoscoping and <b>computer</b> <b>animation</b> (CGI), with the latter facilitating the realistic appearance of the film's rain sequences. Shinkai made half of the film's backgrounds by using his photographs as a base and then drawing over the top with Adobe Photoshop, while the other half were fictional settings created with traditional animation and computer graphics. As with his other films, the backgrounds are vivid and meticulously drawn scenery while the characters are drawn with less detail, though they are still convincing and realistic.|$|E
