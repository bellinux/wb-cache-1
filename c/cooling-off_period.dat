5|$|Another {{problem with}} the NIF lasers is that the flashtubes create a {{significant}} amount of heat, which warms the laser glass enough to cause it to deform. This requires a lengthy <b>cooling-off</b> <b>period</b> between shots, on the order of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day. To be useful as a power plant, about a dozen shots would have to take place every second, well beyond the capabilities of the NIF lasers.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1960, Kasa-Vubu {{announced}} that he had unilaterally dismissed Lumumba on national radio using the massacres in South Kasai as a pretext and with the promise of American backing. Andrew Cordier, the American UN representative in the Congo, used his position to block communications by Lumumba's faction and to prevent a coordinated MNC-L reaction to the news. Both chambers of Parliament, however, supported Lumumba and denounced Kasa-Vubu's action. Lumumba attempted to dismiss Kasa-Vubu from his position, but could not get support for this, precipitating a constitutional crisis. Ostensibly in order to resolve the deadlock, Joseph-Désiré Mobutu launched a bloodless coup and replaced both Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba with a College of Commissionaires-General (Collège des Commissaires-généraux) consisting of a panel of university graduates, led by Justin Bomboko. Soviet military advisors were ordered to leave. Allegedly, the coup was intended to force the politicians to take <b>cooling-off</b> <b>period</b> before they could resume control. In practice, however, Mobutu sided with Kasa-Vubu against Lumumba, who was placed under house arrest, guarded by Ghanaian UN troops and an outer ring of ANC soldiers. Kasa-Vubu was re-appointed President by Mobutu in February 1961. From the coup onwards, Mobutu was able to exert considerable power in Congolese politics behind the scenes.|$|E

40|$|This article {{studies the}} law and {{economics}} of <b>cooling-off</b> <b>periods</b> and secondary markets for online media. The discussion is fueled by a current debate: In July 2009, the online retail juggernaut, Amazon. com, remotely deleted literary classics from consumers’ portable “Kindle” reading devices. The public outcry and class-action lawsuit that followed have reinvigorated an ongoing debate about how much control digital media distributors should wield. Pundits and plaintiffs argue that too often, digital distributors like Amazon impair consumer freedom by misusing Digital Rights Management (DRM) software systems. However, these same systems could also provide significant benefits that have largely gone ignored. This article argues that, {{with the help of}} DRM, lawmakers could provide for <b>cooling-off</b> <b>periods</b> and nurture secondary markets for downloaded media that would benefit consumers, copyright holders, and digital distributors...|$|R
40|$|Behavioral {{economics}} lies at {{the intersection}} of economics and psychology, drawing from scholarship in social, cognitive, and developmental psychology to understand, predict, and assist human judgment and decision making. Behavioral economists have proposed a “libertarian paternalism ” framework for improving social welfare. Interventions that preserve free choice (the libertarian component) while “nudging ” people in helpful ways (the paternalism component) are tailored to circumvent particular shortcomings of judgment and choice. Nudges can involve providing information, reframing information, changing default options, enabling self-restrictions, fostering commitments, instituting <b>cooling-off</b> <b>periods,</b> and establishing sin taxes. These kinds of interventions might prove helpful for psychologists seeking to address a wide range of therapeutic goals and behavioral changes, whether at the individual or community level through service provision or by crafting and supporting effective policy proposals. Though we are enthusiastic about the promise of libertarian paternalism, we believe that a number of potential pitfalls should be carefully considered on a nudge-by-nudge basis to prevent the paternalistic component of the approach from undermining its equally important libertarian foundation, and ultimately its utility...|$|R
30|$|In athletes, the {{traditional}} sauna has some {{positive effects on}} thermoregulation, if the competition is in a hot environment (Tyka et al. 2008). Also, during weight-reduction, sauna bathing has been used successfully (Viitasalo et al. 1987; Karila et al. 2008). In the recovery from physical exercise, sauna bathing has been used despite it seems that some other methods such as light aerobic exercise, nutrition, massage, sleep, rest are more efficient (e.g. Bompa and Haff 2009). The role of traditional sauna bathing has been more recreational and relaxing in nature. The warm temperatures and <b>cooling-off</b> <b>periods</b> may relax muscles, nerves and blood vessels. This can produce a sensation of calm and relaxation in some people. Conversely, the role of FIRS on recovery has not been scientifically studied. Therefore, the first aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate effects of FIRS bathing on recovery from strength training and endurance training sessions. The rationale is primarily based on the fact that the infrared heat penetrates very deeply (approx. 3 – 4  cm) into the neuromuscular system. This may have positive effects on the neuromuscular system during recovery. The second aim was to study possible differences between FIRS and traditional (TRAD) Finnish sauna bathing.|$|R

40|$|Highlights: Despite strong {{performance}} in many areas, Canada continues {{to struggle with}} controlling the influence {{of money in the}} political process. There are no limits on loans to political parties or candidates, and in nomination and political party leadership races, loopholes allow for secrecy when it comes to financial contributions to candidates. Despite <b>cooling-off</b> <b>periods</b> for officials leaving the executive branch, Members of Parliament and their staff are not subject to any post-government employment restrictions, encouraging a revolving door effect between lawmakers and lobbyists. Meanwhile, the personal assets disclosures of Canadian Senators remain confidential and inaccessible to the public, a bizarre exception for one of the world's wealthier and more developed democracies. Judicial accountability is also weak, with no disclosure of personal assets or gifts, no restrictions on receiving gifts, and a complaints process in which judges judge other judges. Overall, government accountability watchdog agencies (including the police) either lack powers to enforce laws or have a weak enforcement record.

The letter highlighted a number of Human Rights Watch officials who had been involved in foreign policy roles in the US government, including Washington advocacy director Tom Malinowski, formerly a speechwriter for Madeleine Albright and a special adviser to Bill Clinton, and subsequently Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor to John Kerry, and HRW Americas advisory committee members Myles Frechette (a former United States Ambassador to Colombia) and Michael Shifter (former Latin America director for the US government-funded National Endowment for Democracy). The letter contrasted HRW's criticism of Venezuela's candidacy for the United Nations Human Rights Council in a letter to Hugo Chávez to the lack of censure regarding the United States' tenure {{as a member of the}} Council, despite the US government's use of a [...] "kill list" [...] for designated enemies, ongoing usage of extraordinary renditions and the continued detention of combatants at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.

500|$|Klein's {{government}} had received criticism {{for reducing the}} importance of the legislature by sitting it fewer days than any other province's legislature and for directing business through standing policy committees of the Progressive Conservative caucus. These committees met in private, unlike the legislature's all-party committees, which fell almost entirely out of use during the Klein years. In April 2007, Stelmach initiated the creation of four new legislative [...] "policy field committees" [...] which would include opposition representation. The same month, his government introduced new legislation on conflicts of interest, such that former cabinet ministers would have to wait one year before doing business with the government or lobbying it on behalf of third parties (up from six months). It also created a similar <b>cooling-off</b> <b>period</b> for senior bureaucrats, which lasted six months. [...] However, an Order in Council passed by Stelmach's cabinet shortly before the 2008 election delayed the implementation of these rules until one month after the election, meaning that cabinet ministers who retired or lost their bids for re-election would be exempt from the new rules.|$|E
500|$|Melwood was {{overgrown}} and {{had only}} an old wooden cricket pavilion. One of the pitches [...] "looked as if bombs had been dropped on it" [...] and Shankly asked if the Germans had [...] "been over" [...] in the war. He instituted a development program to cultivate the site and modernise the facilities and, in the meantime, arranged for the players to meet and change at Anfield before going to and from Melwood by bus. According to biographer Stephen Kelly, Liverpool's eventual success was based on hard work done in the training system that Shankly, Paisley, Fagan and Bennett introduced at Melwood. Shankly deplored long distance running on roads and insisted that, apart from warm-up exercises or any special exercises needed to overcome injuries, the players trained on grass using a ball. Everything was done systematically with players rotating through exercise routines in groups {{with the purpose of}} achieving set targets. Five-a-side games, as at all Shankly's earlier clubs, were {{at the heart of the}} system and he insisted on these being as competitive as league matches. One particular routine designed to develop stamina, reflexes and ball skills was the [...] "sweat box" [...] which Shankly described as [...] "using boards like the walls of a house with players playing the ball off one wall and on to the next; the ball was played against the boards, you controlled it, turned around and took it again". Shankly got the idea from a routine he had seen Tom Finney use at Preston to hone his skills. After experimenting with the routine, he set the players a limit of two minutes per session. The system was geared to Shankly's simple philosophy of [...] "pass and move", which formed the basis of Liverpool's strategy. Shankly insisted on suitable <b>cooling-off</b> <b>periods</b> after training (now called [...] "warming down") before the players took a bath and had a meal. The team changed the studs in their boots to suit all playing conditions. Shankly summarised the entire strategy as: [...] "attention to detail; we never left anything to chance".|$|R
