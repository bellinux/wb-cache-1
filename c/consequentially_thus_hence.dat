25|$|Once {{conditioned}} {{fish are}} stimulated into spawning, males begin chasing females energetically. Females begin developing eggs within their reproductive tracts, and when 'ripe' (laden with eggs), become {{receptive to the}} attentions of the males.

In {{contrast to the}} network-centric Open Service Access (OSA) in third-generation mobile networks (3 G), this architecture moves the point of integration for user services out to the mobile devices, where we can create support for context-aware computing and communication. Support for peer-to-peer service negotiation with minimal a-priori shared knowledge, context representation, and reasoning about context enables the mobile agents (that represent users and other entities) {{to be aware of}} and react to any event and <b>thus</b> context. <b>Hence,</b> the delivery of context-aware applications to users intertwining digital and physical objects in mobile interactive spaces leverages events from sensors, mobility support, and digital entities.

Bruder and Räthke-Döppner (2008) mention that migrants often face discrimination in formal labour markets, which then drives them into (necessity) self-employment.

AVF inhibits TMV multiplication in infected leaves and suppresses virus synthesis almost totally in a local-lesion host. Some AVF is also produced when Nicotiana glutinosa L. is infected with a non-localized virus, but to a much lesser extent and at a later stage of infection.
