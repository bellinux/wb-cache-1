25|$|For 1949, minor {{modifications}} to the brake drums, switching from vanes to slits for cooling, along with small changes to the <b>cockpit</b> <b>control</b> layout and a repositioned oil header-tank resulted in a car {{sometimes referred to as}} the 4CLT/49. It was never known as such by the factory. The Ascari/Villoresi/Parnell trio, joined by Juan Manuel Fangio and Toulo de Graffenried, took up where they had left off the previous season, winning nine of the first fifteen races of 1949, including de Graffenried's victory in the British Grand Prix. However, {{the second half of the}} season only saw three further wins, as increasingly competitive Ferrari and Talbot cars squeezed out the Maseratis in most major races.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory was}} that the thrust {{reverser}} of the No. 2 (right side) engine activated during the climb , since one of the thrust reversers was seen {{to be in the}} deployed position in the wreckage. The investigation concluded that the position of the thrust reverser was a result of the accident, not a cause of it. If the reverser deployed during takeoff, and not as a result of impact, {{it has been suggested that}} the plane would have yawed suddenly to the right. Aircraft engineer Alberto Garcia dismissed this suggestion, pointing out that the MD-82 has tail-mounted engines positioned close to each other and to the plane's longitudinal axis, so that any yaw from asymmetric thrust would be small. Thrust reversers are normally employed just after touch down to reduce braking distances. Examination of the aircraft's maintenance logs showed that the thrust reverser on the right-side engine had been deactivated pending repair. It had been wired shut, and tape placed over the <b>cockpit</b> <b>control</b> to alert the crew. The MD-82 is permitted to fly with just one operable thrust reverser.|$|E
500|$|The {{control box}} for the {{automatic}} pilot was {{recovered from the}} wreckage. [...] The control knob for its gyroscope was in the caged position and the CAGED warning flag was in view even though the control box carried a placard stating the gyro must be uncaged before takeoff. [...] The automatic pilot's speed valve unit was also recovered; it showed that the three valves were open in positions indicating the unit was operating {{at the time of}} the crash. [...] The investigation panel proposed that the automatic pilot might have been engaged at a height of about 400ft (120m) causing the aircraft to descend swiftly into the sea. Engagement could have occurred inadvertently when one of the pilots intended to select fuel cross-feed ON. The operating levers for fuel cross-feed and automatic pilot were the same shape, the same height above the cockpit floor, and about 12 inches (305mm) apart on the <b>cockpit</b> <b>control</b> console.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the event}} of pilot disorientation, the Flight Control System allows for rapid and {{automatic}} recovery by the simple press of a button. On selection of this <b>cockpit</b> <b>control</b> the FCS takes full control of the engines and flying controls, and automatically stabilises the aircraft in a wings level, gentle climbing attitude at 300 knots, until the pilot is ready to retake control. The aircraft also has an Automatic Low-Speed Recovery system (ALSR) which prevents it from departing from controlled flight at very low speeds and high angle of attack. The FCS system is able to detect a developing low-speed situation and to raise an audible and visual low-speed cockpit warning. This gives the pilot sufficient time to react and to recover the aircraft manually. If the pilot does not react, however, or if the warning is ignored, the ALSR takes control of the aircraft, selects maximum dry power for the engines and returns the aircraft to a safe flight condition. Depending on the attitude, the FCS employs an ALSR [...] "push", [...] "pull" [...] or [...] "knife-over" [...] manoeuvre.|$|E
50|$|The ALE-47 {{consists}} of a <b>cockpit</b> <b>control</b> unit, sequencer units, countermeasure dispensers and an optional programmer. The <b>cockpit</b> <b>control</b> unit provides an interface with the pilot. A programmer {{can be added to}} add extra features, such as advanced threat evaluation. It {{can also be used to}} fully integrate the system with an aircraft's glass cockpit eliminating the need for the <b>cockpit</b> <b>control</b> unit. The sequencer units control the dispensers, and are automatically capable of detecting misfires and correcting them. The sequencers are built into the dispenser units on the rotary-wing version. Each dispenser can hold five different types of countermeasures for a total of 30. The whole system can accommodate up to 32 dispensers on fixed-wing aircraft and 16 on rotary-wing aircraft.|$|E
50|$|An {{external}} {{electrical conduit}} extends {{the length of}} the warhead which attaches the guidance adapter and control unit.

50|$|Original artwork artist Russ Heath had {{accurately}} {{depicted the}} downward slanting gun sight and angled <b>cockpit</b> <b>control</b> panel.

50|$|Some 1940s {{aircraft}} engines featured electrically operated wastegates, {{such as the}} Wright R-1820 on the B-17 Flying Fortress. General Electric was the biggest manufacturer of these systems. Being {{before the age of}} computers, they were entirely analog. Pilots had a <b>cockpit</b> <b>control</b> to select different boost levels. Electric wastegates soon fell out of favor due to design philosophies which mandated the separation of the engine controls from the electrical system.|$|E
50|$|In some {{two-stage}} systems, damper doors {{would be}} opened or closed {{by the pilot}} in order to bypass one stage as needed. Some systems had a <b>cockpit</b> <b>control</b> for opening or closing a damper to the intercooler/aftercooler, providing another way to control temperature. Rolls-Royce Merlin engines had fully automated boost control with all the pilot having to do was advance the throttle with the control system limiting boost as necessary until maximum altitude was reached.|$|E
40|$|A C- 11 B Instrument Flight Trainer was {{converted}} into a variable stability flight simulator. The original frame, <b>cockpit,</b> <b>controls,</b> pneumatic system and instruments were utilized as well as certain other necessary components. The original aerodynamic and engine computers were removed, a new instrument drive system was designed and a hybrid computer was programed to solve the equations of motion. The <b>cockpit</b> <b>controls</b> supplied the inputs to the computer which in turn supplied the outputs to the various instruments through their respective drive systems. The computer program may be quickly changed to simulate the aerodynamic characteristics of almost any single engine jet aircraft, or the parameters of a specific aircraft may be varied to investigate their effects on flying qualities.

50|$|One of {{his major}} {{contributions}} was shape coding in the aircraft cockpit. After a series of runway crashes of the Boeing B-17, Chapanis found that certain <b>cockpit</b> <b>controls</b> were confused with each other, due partly to their proximity and similarity of shape. Particularly, the controls for flaps and landing gear were confused, the consequences {{of which could be}} severe. Chapanis proposed attaching a wheel {{to the end of the}} landing gear control and a triangle to the end of the flaps control, to enable them to be easily distinguished by touch alone. Thereafter for that aircraft there were no further instances of the landing gear being mistakenly raised while the aircraft was still on the ground. This particular shape-coding of <b>cockpit</b> <b>controls</b> is still used today.|$|R
50|$|Control {{systems for}} UAVs are often {{different}} than manned craft. For remote human control, {{a camera and}} video link almost always replace the cockpit windows; radio-transmitted digital commands replace physical <b>cockpit</b> <b>controls.</b> Autopilot software is used on both manned and unmanned aircraft, with varying feature sets.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 89 - 90). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis presents the system integration and upgrade of the Texas A&M Flight Mechanics Laboratory Engineering Flight Simulator (EFS). This upgrade replaced the previous EFS, a simplistic design that did not resemble an aircraft cockpit or present the pilot with a visual environment adequate for basic flight maneuvers. The EFS goals included: increased field of view for scenery generation, enlarging and improving the cockpit environment, providing a rudimentary <b>cockpit</b> <b>control</b> loader and developing a reliable, portable, data acquisition system. Two head down displays, surrounded by buttons, are installed in a T- 37 military trainer cockpit. A digital aircraft configuration indicator completes the instrument panel. Optical encoders monitor all <b>cockpit</b> <b>control</b> effectors connected to a control loader providing a linear stick force gradient and 12 lbs. maximum force. A serial based data acquisition system records all parameters and is compatible with all foreseeable computing platforms. A projector frame, mounts three projectors displaying information from a Silicon Graphics Inc. computer yielding a 148 ? field of view on three eight foot wide screens.
