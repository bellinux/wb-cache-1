5|$|Despite their celebrated {{success at}} turning {{spectacular}} plays in collaboration, {{relations between the}} teammates {{were said to have}} been often strained. Tinker and Evers feuded for many years. On September 14, 1905, Tinker and Evers engaged in a fistfight on the field because Evers had taken a <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> the stadium and left his teammates behind in the hotel lobby. They did not speak for years following this event. According to some tellings, Tinker and Evers did not speak to one another again following their fight for 33 years, until they were asked to participate in the radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series, between the Cubs and the New York Yankees. Neither Tinker nor Evers knew the other had been invited. However, in 1929, Tinker joined Evers in signing a ten-week contract to perform a theatrical skit on baseball in different cities across the United States.|$|E
5|$|In May and June 2010, Wu participated {{with his}} father in filming for the 17th season of The Amazing Race, an American reality {{television}} game show. Upon this announcement, {{it was also the}} first time his dad's name, Michael, was revealed, which was kept anonymous since his debut. Wu officially announced his participation on Facebook on September 1, and on YouTube a week later. The season premiered on September 26, 2010. Michael and Kevin's best placement was a third-place finish in Leg 2 and Leg 6. Their worst placement was a last place finish (9th) in Leg 3, a non-elimination leg. They ended up in seventh place and were eliminated in Leg 7 after being issued two 30-minute penalties for using a <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> travel between tasks on the leg when they were instructed to walk; another team had also issued a similar penalty and checked in after them, but only had one half-hour penalty, resulting in Kevin and Michael's elimination.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that the plan to rid Richter of the title was concocted by WWF Chairman Vince McMahon, who brought in Moolah after Richter refused to sign a new contract with the WWF. Richter, however, claims she was still under her original five-year contract, but that she regularly had disagreements with McMahon about her compensation. She also claims that when {{she arrived at the}} arena that day, she was surprised to find Moolah backstage, as she never showed up to events at which she was not scheduled to wrestle. After the match, an infuriated Richter left the arena in her wrestling gear, took a <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> the airport, and booked herself on a flight out of New York. Afterward, she never spoke to Moolah again.|$|E

50|$|The Isle of Wight shunters, nos. 03079 and 03179, {{were also}} rebuilt with cut-down <b>cabs,</b> <b>to</b> {{enable them to}} pass through a low tunnel in Ryde.|$|R
50|$|Half-locomotives 036B, 088A and 116A {{have been}} rebuilt as PKP EU07-537, EU07-544 and PKP EU07-545 respectively. This has {{required}} <b>cabs</b> <b>to</b> be {{built at the}} back end.|$|R
5|$|The main design {{differences}} with the Nclass included the cab front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between the frames to drive the centre driving axle. Clayton had revised the layout of the cab front spectacle plates (small windows {{on the front of the}} <b>cab)</b> <b>to</b> improve forward visibility. This incorporated two large single panes of glass either side of the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the Nclass. The inside cylinder was to be actuated by Holcroft's design of conjugated valve gear, which consisted of mechanical links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear, eliminating the need for a separate set of valve gear between the frames to operate the inside cylinder. The result would be a reduction in weight and the amount of mechanical equipment located in this inaccessible part of the locomotive.|$|E
5|$|The offset boiler {{and coal}} bunker caused the locomotive's {{centre of gravity}} to be shifted to one side. Experiments had to be {{undertaken}} to balance the locomotive by filling the linking corridor with large quantities of scrap metal, replaced in a re-design by a raised floor, covering the weighted material. These modifications resulted in the engine exceeding the total weight limit of 150 tons (151 tonnes), severely limiting the design's route availability during testing. A related problem was that despite being a tall locomotive, at , the cab ceilings were relatively low. The cab at the smokebox end of the locomotive suffered from the same excessive heat as did the fireman's <b>cab.</b> <b>To</b> circumvent this problem the locomotive was used in reverse, as the rear cab was next to the water tank and coal chute and therefore away from the hot gases circulating inside the smokebox.|$|E
5|$|They started {{recording}} Astraea in June at James Spence's {{house in}} Nottingham. They {{were forced into}} this situation as Sanderson's recording studio was taken from him through a contractual issue on the building with the landlord. The recording process was different from previous albums as {{there was a lot}} of production and pre-production involved. Sanderson would come to the practice sessions of the bands and make suggestions to the songs and then they would go to record it. The album took three months to record because of band member's personal commitments, this to James Spence had a positive effect as the members took their time with the music, believing the album was more “produced” than previous efforts. James believed Rolo Tomassi had much more of an opportunity to experiment in the studio and try things they had never tried before. However, James had commented that the recording of the album in his house revealed to be a stressful decision. An example of this was were his basement- where all the recording equipment was- flooded due to heavy rainfall. Although nothing got damaged, stagnant water remained and they had to move the guitar <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> his bedroom. They recorded the drums upstairs at The Bodega in Nottingham then Rolo Tomassi then went to James and Eva Spence's parents house record the vocals, keyboard and pianos.|$|E

50|$|In 1992-1993, {{all except}} numbers 2202 to 2210 were fitted with Automatic train {{protection}} (ATP). Between 1995 and 1999 eleven received extended <b>cabs</b> <b>to</b> relieve cramping {{caused by the}} ATP equipment.|$|R
25|$|The {{class was}} {{designed}} at Derby Works and introduced in 1953. The design {{derived from the}} LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-2T which BR had built after nationalisation. Modifications {{were made to the}} Ivatt design including a reduced <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> reduce the loading gauge and some standard fittings. BR classified them 2MT, emphasising a mixed-traffic role.|$|E
25|$|She later {{starred in}} PorkChop Productions' first show, a {{production}} of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. That led to her being appointed PorkChop's full-time producer, which led her to develop material to stage at the Sydney Opera House. Phillips produced Last <b>Cab</b> <b>to</b> Darwin for PorkChop Productions which was staged at the Opera House in Sydney and at the Black Swan State Theatre Company in Perth.|$|E
25|$|The eleven {{locomotives}} in {{the class}} had condensing apparatus that fed the exhaust steam {{back into the water}} tanks. The tanks themselves were shortened {{to make room for the}} external exhaust pipes and were extended down to the footplate in front of the <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> increase their capacity. As condensing the steam heated the water, a reciprocating pump (Weir pump) was fitted as a boiler feedwater pump because standard injectors will not work with hot water. The pumps led to (unsuccessful) tests with these locomotives acting as fire engines during World War II.|$|E
2500|$|A promotional {{music video}} was {{released}} for the mini-album, which combined videos for brief excerpts {{of each of}} the tracks (including a crude home-made claymation video for [...] "Germ") with vox pop interviews conducted by the band members in the streets of Melbourne. No single was released, although [...] "Two <b>Cabs</b> <b>to</b> the Toucan" [...] was promoted on Countdown. Cut Lunch peaked at #37 in the Australian albums charts and at #38 on the singles charts. [...] "Cut Lunch", the title track, and [...] "Two <b>Cabs</b> <b>to</b> the Toucan" [...] were the most played tracks on radio.|$|R

50|$|From 2004, five 8-car {{sets were}} {{reformed}} to create pairs of 3-car 800 and 850 series driver-only-operation sets {{for use on}} Sano and Kiryū Line services. This conversion involved adding new <b>cabs</b> <b>to</b> former MoHa8300 and MoHa8200 intermediate cars.|$|R
25|$|The first 5700 locomotive, No. 7711, {{underwent}} trials from January to April 1956, first running between Finchley Road and Baker Street. Modifications {{were needed}} to the cab for clearance and the tripcock brake valves after problems were found when running in reverse. Curtains were also fitted to the <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> reduce smoke and fumes in tunnels. In May, the 5700s became the standard for engineering trains on London Transport when they bought No. 7711 (for £3,160), decided to buy another (No. 5752), and planned to buy more over the coming years.|$|E
25|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the Deodhar Trophy quarterfinal, Pandove was travelling from Sambalpur to his hometown Patiala. After getting off the train at Ambala Cantt, he took a <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> Patiala on the night of 31 January 1992. He died near Ambala as the cab met with an accident on the Grand Trunk Road. The cab driver was also killed and Pandove's friend Bittu was critically injured. Pandove's death was mentioned by BBC and the Australian commentators of the Australia-India Test match that was happening at Perth. The Indian team observed a two minutes' silence {{before the start of the}} match.|$|E
25|$|While being {{deported}} to the U.S., Abagnale escaped from a British VC-10 airliner {{as it was}} turning onto a taxiway at New York's JFK International Airport. Under cover of night, he scaled a nearby fence and hailed a <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> Grand Central Terminal. After stopping in The Bronx to change clothes {{and pick up a}} set of keys to a Montreal bank safe deposit box containing $20,000, Abagnale caught a train to Montreal's Dorval airport to purchase a ticket to São Paulo, Brazil. After a close call at a Mac's Milk, he was apprehended by a constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police while standing in line at the ticket counter. Abagnale was subsequently handed over to the U.S. Border Patrol.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, {{six were}} rebuilt as the DA class with new <b>cabs</b> <b>to</b> {{allow them to}} be used as shunters. In December 1994 two 48 class {{locomotives}} were purchased from the State Rail Authority. One was rebuilt as DA7 and the other scrapped.|$|R

25|$|Luttrell wrote a {{note and}} asked that it {{be taken to the}} American base at Asadabad. Because Gulab had {{previously}} met the Marine commander based at Nangalam, he asked an older man named Shina, of another part of the village of Salar Ban, to make the trek with the note to that base instead. This required a longer journey down the trails of the Shuryek valley to Matin, where he then hired a <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> drive the Pech road to Nangalam. Gulab gave Shina 1,000 Afghanis (about twenty U.S. dollars). When Shina reached the base in Nangalam {{in the middle of the}} night he met with the commander and related the story about a wounded American soldier in their village. He then gave him the note that Luttrell had written.|$|E
25|$|A {{couple of}} weeks before Mötley Crüe was set to tour the New Tattoo album, Castillo became ill while {{performing}} with his mariachi side project Azul at the Cat Club in Hollywood. Immediately after the show Castillo took a <b>cab</b> <b>to</b> nearby Cedars Sinai Hospital where he collapsed as he was being admitted. The doctors discovered a duodenal ulcer that had ruptured his stomach and performed emergency surgery that saved Castillo’s life. While taking time off from Mötley Crüe to recover from his surgery, he discovered a small lump on his jaw and a month later, after it had grown to roughly the size of a golf ball, he sought treatment and was diagnosed with Squamous cell Carcinoma, a common form of cancer that is not usually fatal if it is discovered early but can spread rapidly if left untreated. The cancer went into remission in mid-2001, and he was rumored to be rejoining Osbourne's solo band for that summer Ozzfest tour (along with Geezer Butler on bass), though these rumors were later revealed to be untrue.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, on May 19, 1946, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) awarded Braniff {{routes to}} the Caribbean, Mexico, Central and South America, {{competing}} with Pan American-Grace Airways (Panagra). The Civil Aeronautics Board awarded Braniff a 7719 statute mile route from Dallas to Houston to Havana, Balboa, C.Z., Panama, Guayaquil, Lima, La Paz, Asuncion, and finally Buenos Aires, Argentina. At that time, the airline changed its trade name to Braniff International Airways and flights to South America via Cuba and Panama began on June 4, 1948 with a routing of Chicago – Kansas City – Dallas – Houston – Havana – Balboa, C.Z. – Guayaquil – Lima (Lima service did not being until June 18, 1948). after construction in remote regions of Central and South America. The route was then extended in February 1949 to La Paz and in March 1949, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Douglas DC-4s and Douglas DC-6s flew to Rio; initially DC-3s flew Lima to La Paz. Braniff {{was the first}} airline authorized by the <b>CAB</b> <b>to</b> operate JATO or Jet Assisted Takeoff aircraft (DC-4) at La Paz.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, Scania-Vabis {{acquired}} {{ownership of}} a then valuable supplier – Be-Ge Karosserifabrik, who were based in Oskarshamn. Be-Ge had been making truck cabs since 1946, and had been supplying <b>cabs</b> not only <b>to</b> Scania-Vabis, but also to their Swedish competitors Volvo. It was normal practice for truck manufacturers to outsource production of <b>cabs</b> <b>to</b> independent bodybuilders, so their acquisition by Scania-Vabis seemed a good move. Be-Ge owner Bror Göthe Persson had also established an additional cab factory at Meppel.|$|R
