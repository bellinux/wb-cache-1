5|$|Makriyannis, {{having been}} ignored by history, and hardly {{mentioned}} by chroniclers of the War of Independence, had {{renewed interest in}} the revolution by offering a significant personal testimony to historical research. Despite this, after the initial interest in the newly published Memoirs, they were hardly cited for almost 40 years. One <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Makriyannis was forgotten, {{not only as a}} fighter, but also as the author of a text written in Demotic Greek; a text that, besides reproducing the heroic atmosphere of the War of Independence, is also a treasure-house of linguistic knowledge concerning the common Greek tongue of the time.|$|E
5|$|One person <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> 'Hero' is a schmaltzy {{piece of}} garbage, but another person {{can write to}} me a letter and say, 'I've {{considered}} committing suicide {{every day of my}} life for the last ten years until I heard that song, and I realized, after all, I can be my own hero,' and that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've done something with my life, you know? It meant something to someone.|$|E
25|$|Actuality is the {{fulfillment}} {{of the end of}} the potentiality. Because the end (telos) is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.|$|E

25|$|One <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{the anxious}} {{search for the}} origins of Life and Mind; the fascination in the 'mysteries of Nature'; the urge to {{penetrate}} and decipher the inner structure of Matter—all these longings and drives denote a sort of nostalgia for the primordial, for the original universal matrix. Matter, Substance, represents the absolute origin, the beginning of all things.|$|E
25|$|Both Plato and Aristotle {{argue against}} some of Protagoras's claims {{regarding}} relativity; however, {{they argue that the}} concept provides Protagoras with too convenient an exemption from his own theory and that relativism is true for him yet false {{for those who do not}} believe it. They claim that by asserting that truth is relative, Protagoras then <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> whatever further theory he proposed must be true.|$|E
25|$|The book, co-authored with Warren Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Communication, reprints Shannon's 1948 {{article and}} Weaver's popularization of it, which is {{accessible}} to the non-specialist. Warren Weaver {{pointed out that the}} word information in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to what you <b>could</b> <b>say.</b> <b>That</b> is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in John Robinson Pierce's Symbols, Signals, and Noise.|$|E

25|$|Rather {{like their}} Olympic counterparts, Soviet rugby players had a fair degree of shamateurism. Both the Olympics and rugby union were officially amateur, {{but this was}} not really the case. For example, the Dinamo clubs were {{sponsored}} and financed by the KGB, but no one <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> openly that some athletes were full-time shamateurs, and received bonuses for winning including dollars. Masters of Sport were full time, and paid by their sports society. They received 180 rubles each year, plus 30-40 rubles if they were capped for the USSR team paid for by the USSR sports committee. There were frequently unofficial bonuses, and some people could be Masters of Sport for life, meaning that they would receive pay long after their retirement.|$|E
25|$|Mammals are a clade, and {{therefore}} the cladists are happy to acknowledge the traditional taxon Mammalia; and birds, too, are a clade, universally ascribed to the formal taxon Aves. Mammalia and Aves are, in fact, subclades within the grand clade of the Amniota. But the traditional class Reptilia is not a clade. It is just {{a section of the}} clade Amniota: the section that is left after the Mammalia and Aves have been hived off. It cannot be defined by synapomorphies, as is the proper way. Instead, it is defined by a combination of the features it has and the features it lacks: reptiles are the amniotes that lack fur or feathers. At best, the cladists suggest, we <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the traditional Reptilia are 'non-avian, non-mammalian amniotes'.|$|E
25|$|Cellular automata {{are often}} {{simulated}} on a finite grid {{rather than an}} infinite one. In two dimensions, the universe would be a rectangle instead of an infinite plane. The obvious problem with finite grids is {{how to handle the}} cells on the edges. How they are handled will affect the values of all the cells in the grid. One possible method is to allow the values in those cells to remain constant. Another method is to define neighborhoods differently for these cells. One <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they have fewer neighbors, but then one would also have to define new rules for the cells located on the edges. These cells are usually handled with a toroidal arrangement: when one goes off the top, one comes in at the corresponding position on the bottom, and when one goes off the left, one comes in on the right. (This essentially simulates an infinite periodic tiling, and in the field of partial differential equations is sometimes referred to as periodic boundary conditions.) This can be visualized as taping the left and right edges of the rectangle to form a tube, then taping the top and bottom edges of the tube to form a torus (doughnut shape). Universes of other dimensions are handled similarly. This solves boundary problems with neighborhoods, but another advantage is that it is easily programmable using modular arithmetic functions. For example, in a 1-dimensional cellular automaton like the examples below, the neighborhood of a cell xit is {x'i−1t−1, x'i't−1, x'i+1t−1}, where t is the time step (vertical), and i is the index (horizontal) in one generation.|$|E

500|$|Indeed, the {{computation}} of Taylor series {{requires the}} knowledge of the function on an arbitrary small neighbourhood of a point, whereas the computation of the Fourier series requires knowing the function on its whole domain interval. In a certain sense one <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the Taylor series is [...] "local" [...] and the Fourier series is [...] "global".|$|E
500|$|James Cameron said: [...] "I enjoyed Prometheus. I {{thought it}} was great. I {{thought it was}} Ridley {{returning}} to science fiction with gusto, with great tactical performance, beautiful photography, great native 3D. There {{might have been a}} few things that I would have done differently, but that's not the point—you <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> about any movie." ...|$|E
500|$|DNA {{tests were}} carried out by LGC Forensics, a private company which {{undertakes}} forensic analysis for criminal investigations. Lindsey Lennen, a body fluids and DNA specialist {{member of the team}} that analysed DNA samples from Yeates' body, said that although DNA swabs matched Tabak, they were not of sufficient quality to be evaluated. The team deployed a method known as DNA SenCE, which enhances unusable DNA samples through purification and concentration: [...] "We couldn't say whether the DNA was from saliva, or semen, or even touch. But we <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the probability of it not being a match with Tabak was less than one in a billion." ...|$|E

500|$|In his judgement, {{issued on}} 16 November, Biron applied the Hicklin test of obscenity: a work was obscene if it tended to [...] "deprave and corrupt those whose minds {{are open to}} such immoral influences". He held that the book's {{literary}} merit was irrelevant because a well-written obscene book was even more harmful than a poorly written one. The topic in itself was not necessarily unacceptable; a book that depicted the [...] "moral and physical degradation which indulgence in those vices must necessary involve" [...] might be allowed, but no reasonable person <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> a plea for the recognition and toleration of inverts was not obscene. He ordered the book destroyed, with the defendants to pay court costs.|$|E
500|$|The Arabian {{milestones}} {{presented the}} Palmyrene king as a Roman governor and commander, referring {{to him as}} vir clarissimus rex consul imperator dux Romanorum. The assumption of such titles was probably meant to legitimize Zenobia's control of the province, not yet a usurpation of the imperial title. Until now, Zenobia <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> she was acting {{as a representative of}} the emperor (who was securing the eastern lands of the empire) while the Roman monarch was preoccupied with struggles in Europe. Although Vaballathus' use of the titles amounted to a claim to the imperial throne, Zenobia could still justify them and maintain a mask of subordination to Rome; an [...] "imperator" [...] was a commander of troops, not the equal of an emperor ("imperator caesar").|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Secret Speech" [...] {{proved to}} be an utter misnomer. While the {{attendees}} at the Speech were all Soviet, Eastern European delegates were allowed to hear it the following night, read slowly to allow them to take notes. By 5 March, copies were being mailed throughout the Soviet Union, marked [...] "not for the press" [...] rather than [...] "top secret". An official translation appeared within a month in Poland; the Poles printed 12,000 extra copies, one of which soon reached the West. Khrushchev's son, Sergei, later wrote, [...] "learly, Father tried to ensure it would reach as many ears as possible. It was soon read at Komsomol meetings; that meant another eighteen million listeners. If you include their relatives, friends, and acquaintances, you <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the entire country became familiar with the speech... Spring had barely begun when the speech began circulating around the world." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{inspiration}} behind Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... {{came from}} Yash Chopra's Kabhi Kabhie (1976). On being {{inspired by the}} classic, Karan quoted, [...] "What appealed to me {{was the fact that}} the love story stretched out across generations. It began with youth and went on as the people grew older. You <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Kabhi Kabhie is the starting point for my new film, that I am inspired by it. But the film, I am sure, will be very different. It will look different, feel different." [...] Similarly, Karan added an extra [...] "e" [...] to the second Kabhi in the title of his film, due to numerological reasons. In an interview with The Times of India, Karan dispelled comparisons with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and said that while his debut film was [...] "frothy and bubble-gummish", this one was [...] "more classy and sophisticated". He added that there would be [...] "plenty of drama" [...] in this film too, but handled more maturely.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} half of the series, Toriyama has said that he had become more {{interested}} in coming up with the story than actually drawing it, and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines. In 2013, he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest one <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he was not interested in the art. He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an [...] "unconventional and contradictory" [...] story. In 2013, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama said, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy.", [...] "The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. I dare say I don't care even if [...] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers." ...|$|E
500|$|The allies {{decided to}} divide their forces into two armies: a {{multinational}} force {{that included the}} 1st Division and a second army composed entirely of Brazilians under Caxias. The 1st Division led by Marques de Sousa, along with Uruguayan and Argentine rebel troops, invaded Argentina. He found the long march to Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, highly uncomfortable. He had spent his life {{up to that point}} fighting Hispanic-Americans, and he was now marching as their ally, surrounded by them. He did not trust them, and they trusted neither him nor his men. The only person among the allies with whom he shared his thoughts, and guardedly at that, was Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (later president of Argentina): [...] "We [...] form in here a separate group; we do not talk to anyone; no one approaches us and we <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we walk among enemies." [...] On 3 February 1852, in the Battle of Caseros, they faced Rosas and his army. The allies were victorious, Rosas fled to the United Kingdom, and Marques de Sousa acquired his carriage as a war trophy.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Brewster smiled. Of {{a man of}} his {{appearance}} one <b>could</b> hardly <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he smiled playfully; but there was something in his expression that remotely suggested playfulness.|$|R

[...] Clara paused a moment before she answered, not hesitating as to the expediency of telling her mother any truth on the matter in question, but doubting what the truth might really be. <b>Could</b> she <b>say</b> <b>that</b> she was engaged to Mr. Dalrymple, or <b>could</b> she <b>say</b> <b>that</b> she was not? [...] "If you tell me a lie, miss, I'll have you put out of the house." ...|$|R
