40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} recent moves to forge {{stronger}} linkages between the Māori social science academy {{and the policy}} industry. A critical appraisal of this development is offered, with particular attention given to the desirability of enhancing the academy’s role in the policy process, given the policy industry’s continued privileging of Eurocentric theory and research methodologies within the developing evidence-based environment. The paper ends {{with a discussion of}} the possibilities and problems associated with engagement with the policy industry, particularly as these relate to the various roles members can (or are forced to) take; either as ‘insiders’ (such as policy workers and contract researchers), or independent, critical ‘outsiders’. The author concludes that the best that insiders <b>can</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>are</b> incremental, largely ineffective changes to Māori policy, while independent members of the academy are best placed to speak on behalf of Māori, Māori communities, hapu and iwi...|$|R
40|$|Current {{algorithmic}} {{studies of}} genome rearrangement ignore {{the length of}} reversals (or inversions); rather, they only count their number. We introduce a new cost model in which the lengths of the reversed sequences play a role, allowing more flexibility in accounting for mutation phenomena. Our focus is on sorting unsigned (unoriented) permutations by reversals; since this problem remains difficult (NP-hard) in our new model, the best we <b>can</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>are</b> approximation results. We propose an efficient, novel algorithm that takes (a monotonic function f of) length into account as an optimization criterion and study its properties. Our results include an upper bound of O(f(n) lg 2 n) for any additive cost measure f {{on the cost of}} sorting any n-element permutation, and a guaranteed approximation ratio of O(lg 2 n) times optimal for sorting a given permutation. Our work poses some interesting questions to both biologists and computer scientists and suggests some new bioinformatic insights that are currently being studied...|$|R
500|$|In his {{original}} appearance, Jason was scripted as a mentally disabled young boy. Since Friday the 13th, Jason Voorhees has been {{depicted as a}} non-verbal, indestructible, machete-wielding mass murderer. Jason is primarily portrayed as being completely silent throughout the film series. Exceptions to this include flashbacks of Jason as a child, and a brief scene in Jason Takes Manhattan where the character cries out [...] "Mommy, please don't let me drown!" [...] in a child's voice before being submerged in toxic waste, and in Jason Goes To Hell where his spirit possesses other individuals. Online magazine Salon's Andrew O'Hehir describes Jason as a [...] "silent, expressionless...blank slate." [...] When discussing Jason psychologically, Sean S. Cunningham said, [...] "...he doesn't have any personality. He's like a great white shark. You can't really defeat him. All you <b>can</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>is</b> to survive." [...] Since Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, Jason has been a [...] "virtually indestructible" [...] being. Tom McLoughlin, the film's director, felt it was silly that Jason had previously been just another guy in a mask, who would kill people left and right, but get [...] "beaten up and knocked down by the heroine at the end". McLoughlin wanted Jason {{to be more of}} a [...] "formidable, unstoppable monster". In resurrecting Jason from the dead, McLoughlin also gave him the weakness of being rendered helpless if trapped beneath the waters of Crystal Lake; inspired by vampire lore, McLoughlin decided that Jason had in fact drowned as a child, and that returning him to {{his original}} resting place would immobilize him. This weakness would be presented again in The New Blood, and the idea that Jason had drowned as a child was taken up by director Rob Hedden as a plot element in Jason Takes Manhattan.|$|E

6000|$|Sincerity in {{the theatre}} and {{commercial}} success are not necessarily, {{but they are}} generally, opposed. It {{is more or less}} a happy accident when, they coincide. This grim truth cannot be blinked. Not till the heavens fall will the majority of the public demand sincerity. And all that they who care for sincerity <b>can</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>is</b> that the supply of sincere drama will gradually increase the demand for it--gradually lessen the majority which has no use for that disturbing quality. The burden of this struggle is on the shoulders of the dramatists. It is useless and unworthy for them to complain that the public will not stand sincerity, that they cannot get sincere plays acted, and so forth. If they have not the backbone to produce what they feel they ought to produce, without regard to what the public wants, then good-bye to progress of any kind. If they are of the crew who cannot see any good in a fight unless they know it is going to end in victory; if they expect the millennium with every spring--they will advance nothing. Their job is to set their teeth, do their work in their own way, without thinking much about result, and not at all about reward, except from their own consciences. Those who want sincerity will always be the few, but they may well be more numerous than now; and to increase their number is worth a struggle. That struggle was the much-sneered-at, much-talked-of so-called [...] "new" [...] movement in our British drama.|$|E
40|$|Sponsored Report (for Acquisition Research Program) Throughout software''s lifetime, {{changes are}} {{introduced}} to the code {{in order to maintain}} the desired performance. These changes often create side effects, which cause other cascading effects elsewhere in the software or other system components with which the software interfaces. In a sense, the software degrades because of the maintenance performed on it, not because of a lack of maintenance upkeep. This pattern makes the cost of software maintenance difficult to predict, given the amount of variability in the upkeep process. Therefore, the best that program managers <b>can</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>are</b> heuristics that permit them to approximate annual operating budgets when calculating total ownership costs. Typically, these methods employ metrics used during development to estimate the annual cost of maintaining the software (i. e., source lines of code or function points). Through correlation and regression analysis, this thesis examines 62 programs that captured software maintenance data to determine a cost model for software maintenance. Even though a model was not built, the main contribution of this thesis is to provide a greater awareness of the complexity of estimating the costs for software maintenance. Additionally, this thesis provides insight to cost variables that may assist program managers when estimating annual software maintenance costs. Acquisition Research Progra...|$|R

6000|$|The {{impression}} I get, in our big towns, is most peculiar--considering {{that we are}} a free people. The {{faces and}} forms have a look of being possessed. To express my meaning exactly is difficult. There is a dulled and driven look, and yet a general expression of [...] "Keep smiling--Are we down-hearted? No." [...] It is as if people were all being forced along by a huge invisible hand at the back of their necks, whose pressure they resent yet are trying to make the best of, because they cannot tell whence it comes. To understand, you must watch the grip from its very beginnings. The small children who swarm in the little grey playground streets of our big towns pass their years in utter abandonment. They roll and play and chatter in conditions of amazing unrestraint and devil-may-care-dom in the midst of amazing dirt and ugliness. The younger they are, as a rule, the chubbier and prettier they are. Gradually you can see herd-life getting hold of them, the impact of ugly sights and sounds commonising the essential grace and individuality of their little features. On the lack of any standard or restraint, any real glimpse of Nature, any knowledge of a future worth striving for, or indeed of any future at all, they thrive forward into that hand-to-mouth mood from which they are mostly destined never to emerge. Quick and scattery as monkeys, and never alone, they become, at a rake's progress, little fragments of the herd. On poor food, poor air, and habits of least resistance, they wilt and grow distorted, acquiring withal the sort of pathetic hardihood which a Dartmoor pony will draw out of moor life in a frozen winter. All round them, by day, by night, stretches the huge, grey, grimy waste of streets, factory walls, chimneys, murky canals, chapels, public-houses, hoardings, posters, butchers' shops--a waste where nothing beautiful exists save a pretty cat or pigeon, a blue sky, perhaps, and a few trees and open spaces. The children of the class above, too, of the small shop-people, the artisans--do they escape? Not really. The same herd-life and the same sights and sounds pursue them from birth; they also are soon divested of the grace and free look which you see in country children walking to and from school or roaming the hedges. Whether true slum children, or from streets a little better off, quickly they all pass out of youth into the iron drive of commerce and manufacture, into the clang and clatter, the swish and whirr of wheels, the strange, dragging, saw-like hubbub of industry, or the clicking and pigeon-holes of commerce; perch on a devil's see-saw from monotonous work to cheap sensation and back. Considering the conditions it is wonderful that they stand it as well as they do; and I should be the last to deny that they possess remarkable qualities. But the modern industrial English town is a sort of inferno where people dwell with a marvellous philosophy. What would you have? They have never seen any way out of it. And this, perhaps, would not be so pitiful if for each bond-servant of our town-tyranny there was in store a prize--some portion of that national wealth in pursuit of which the tyrant drives us; if each worker had before him the chance of emergence at, say, fifty. But, Lord God! for five that emerge, ninety-and-five stay bound, less free and wealthy {{at the end of the}} chapter than they were at the beginning. And the quaint thing is--they know it; know that they will spend their lives in smoky, noisy, crowded drudgery, and in crowded drudgery die. Wealth goes to wealth, and all they <b>can</b> <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>is</b> a few extra shillings a week, with a corresponding rise in prices. They know it, but it does not disturb them, for they were born of the towns, have never glimpsed at other possibilities. Imprisoned in town life from birth, they contentedly perpetuate the species of a folk with an ebbing future. Yes, ebbing! For if it be not, why is there now so much conscious effort to arrest the decay of town workers' nerves and sinews? Why do we bother to impede a process which is denied? If there be no town-blight on us, why a million indications of uneasiness and a thousand little fights against the march of a degeneration so natural, vast, and methodical, that it brings them all to naught? Our physique is slowly rotting, and that is the plain truth of it.|$|E
