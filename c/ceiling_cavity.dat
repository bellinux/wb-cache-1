40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} certain workmanship requirements {{applying to}} insulants in cavities. It presents previously reported measured {{values for the}} effects of edge gaps, and compares these results with new laboratory measured results for the heat transfer across insulated wall and <b>ceiling</b> <b>cavities,</b> in configurations which permit natural convection to flow around the insulant. The results show the ex-istence of a threshold edge gap width of a few mm for the onset of convection in upward heat flow, but no threshold gap width of detectable size for horizontal heat flow. The loss of thermal performance from convection, as expected, outweighs that previously reported for non-convecting gaps. SUMMARY THERE IS NOW a considerable amount of data [1 - 8] concerning the lossof thermal performance of structural cavities which can result from ther-mal bridging of various forms and degree. In many of these reports, losses of 3 to 5 % of the cavity insulating value for each 1 % of gap width (i. e., edge gap as a percent of cavity width), seem to be quite typical, although there are a few reports in which the loss reaches 10 % or more per 1 % of gap width. To give a perspective to these figures, note that a gap of 1 % would mean a gap width of 5 mm when the frame spacing is at 500 mm, and so would not be difficult either to detect or to avoid. At least one case has been reported [7] in which degradation was much more severe even than above. This is recognisably a case where convective air circulation has enabled heat to bypass the insulant. It occurred in a wall panel, where the convective circulation pressure difference may be relatively large. The corresponding condition applying in <b>ceiling</b> <b>cavities,</b> where the convective circulation pressure must be much smaller, was not reported...|$|R
50|$|Knob-and-tube wiring (sometimes {{abbreviated}} K&T) is {{an early}} standardized method of electrical wiring in buildings, in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s. It consisted of single-insulated copper conductors run within wall or <b>ceiling</b> <b>cavities,</b> passing through joist and stud drill-holes via protective porcelain insulating tubes, and supported along their length on nailed-down porcelain knob insulators. Where conductors entered a wiring device such as a lamp or switch, or were pulled into a wall, they were protected by flexible cloth insulating sleeving called loom. The first insulation was asphalt-saturated cotton cloth, then rubber became common. Wire splices in such installations were twisted together for good mechanical strength, then soldered and wrapped with rubber insulating tape and friction tape (asphalt saturated cloth), or made inside metal junction boxes.|$|R
40|$|Excessive floor {{vibration}} due {{to human}} activities is of growing concern {{due to the}} increase in use of lighter and high-strength materials for long span floors. This problem is exacerbated in office buildings due to the reduction in inherent damping associated with modern fit outs. Excessive floor vibratiom are often realised after the completion of construction or following a change of use of the floor. The main cause of uncertainty in design or vibration assessment of floors is damping. There are few optiom for rectifying floor with excessive vibrations. These include increasing stiffoess, which is often not practical or increasing damping. This paper presents an innovative passive viscoelastic damper to reduce floor vibratiom. This damper can be easily tuned to the fundamental frequency of the floor and can be designed to achieve various damping values. The damper can be sufficiently small to fit within <b>ceiling</b> <b>cavities</b> or under false floors...|$|R

However, absorptive interior surface treatments do not significantly improve the sound isolation from one room to another through demising partitions over the typical frequency range measured currently. Installing absorptive insulation (e.g., fiberglass batts, blow-in cellulose, mineral fiber batts) into the wall or <b>ceiling</b> <b>cavities</b> affects the sound isolation of the partition to varying degrees, depending on the framing configuration and joist or stud depth. For example, the presence of type of insulation in single 2x4 wood stud framing spaced 16" [...] (406 mm) on-center results in only a few STC points. In contrast, adding standard fiberglass insulation to an otherwise empty cavity in light-gauge (25-gauge or lighter) steel stud partitions can result in a nearly 10 STC-point improvement.

Moreover, variations were observed when comparing cells numbers on cavity’s filling versus the surrounding dentine disc. The highest number of cells was recorded on dentin chips whereas the opposite was true for Bio-Oss. This was confirmed in the migration assay where a statistically significant lower number of cells migrated towards Bio-Oss as compared to MTA and dentin chips.

40|$|The fore-Ural is a {{classical}} region of intrastratal gypsum karst. The intensive development of karst in the Permian gypsums and anhydrites causes numerous practical problems, the subsidence hazard {{being the most}} severe. Mechanisms of karst breakdown formation were studied in detail in the Kunguskaya Cave area. The cave and its setting are characteristic to the region and, being a site of detailed stationary studies for many years, the cave represents a convenient location for various karst and speleological investigations. Breakdown structures related to cavities of the Kungurskaya Cave type develop by two mechanisms: gravitational (sagging and fall-in of the <b>ceilings</b> of <b>cavities)</b> and filtrational/gravitational (crumbling and fall-in of the ceilings of vertical solution pipes, facilitated by percolation). The former implies upward stoping of the breakout roof and cessation of the process at some height above {{the floor of the}} cave due to complete infilling by fallen clasts. This mechanism cannot generate surface deformation where the overburden thickness exceeds a certain value. The latter mechanism implies that breakdown will almost inevitably express itself at the surface, most commonly as a sudden collapse, even where the thickness of the overburden is large. These mechanisms result in different appearance, distribution and further evolution of the respective surface forms, so that subsidence hazard assessment should be performed differently for these types of breakdown. The conclusions reached by this study are representative for the region, although some of them bear more general validity for intrastratal karst conditions. This study underlines the ultimate importance of speleological investigations to the understanding of karst breakdown mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the behaviour of lightweight steel framed (LSF) unrestrained floors, protected with gypsum board ceilings, in five standard fire resistance tests. Parameters investigated {{in this test}} series were joist spacing, number of gypsum board layers in the <b>ceiling</b> membrane, floor <b>cavity</b> insulation and presence of concrete topping in the sub-floor. The fire resistance of LSF floors appears to be essentially governed by the ability of gypsum board to remain in place under fire exposure; other factors are of secondary importance. Retrospective numerical thermal-structural simulations of these tests show good agreement with measured temperature and deformation histories. The development of floor deflections is governed by the thermal bowing of steel joists except for the last one or two minutes in the tests, when "run-away" deformations develop due {{to the formation of}} inelastic hinges near mid-span. Evaluation of bending moment resistance of heated joists using current design provisions for cold formed steel structures, adjusted to account for the deterioration of strength and stiffness of steel at elevated temperatures, leads to conservative and fairly accurate predictions of fire resistance...|$|R

There was also evidence of water being diverted above the <b>ceiling</b> of a <b>cavity</b> in the immediate vicinity of the monitoring boreholes. Observations from this field experiment suggest that isolated conduits, each encompassing a large number of fractures, develop within the fractured rock formation to form preferential flow paths that persist if there is a continuous supply of water.

Kerosene is injected through the <b>ceiling</b> of the <b>cavity.</b> Chamber wall pressure predicted from the LES is validated by experimental data reported in literature. The test case has a cavity length of 77 mm {{and the depth of}} 8 mm. After liquid kerosene is injected through the orifice, most of the droplets are loaded with recirculation fluid momentum inside the cavity. Due to lower velocity of the carrier fluid inside the cavity, sufficient atomization and evaporation take place during the processes of droplets transportation, resulting in rich fuel mixture of kerosene vapor accumulating inside the cavity. These rich fuel mixtures are mixed with fresh air by the approach mixing layer {{at the front of the}} cavity, thus are involved in burning accompanied with the approach boundary layer separation extending towards upstream. The combustion flame in the downstream impinges onto the rear wall of cavity, and then is reflected back to the front of the cavity. During the recirculation of hot flow, heat is compensated for droplets evaporation. The circulation processes mentioned above provide an efficient flame holding mechanism to stabilize the flame. Comparisons with results from a shorter length of cavity (cavity length of 45 mm) shows that, due to insufficient atomization and evaporation of droplets in the short distance inside the cavity, parts of droplets are carried out of the cavity through the boundary layer fluctuation, and evaporated in the hot flame layer, thus results incomplete air fuel mixing and worse combustion performance. The flow structures inside the cavity play an important role in the spray distribution, thus determine the combustion performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experimental}} study is {{the investigation of the}} natural convection of air in a differentially heated cavity, containing an obstacle at the <b>ceiling</b> (lintel). The <b>cavity,</b> 32 cm depth, with a l m x l m vertical cross-section, is heated on one vertical side, and cooled on the opposite wall. A lintel of 5 cm in width and 30 cm in height is fixed to the centre of the ceiling along the centre of the cavity. The temperature difference between the two vertical active walls is controlled at 15 °C in order to reach a weakly turbulent flow pattern characterised by a Rayleigh number nearly 1. 5 x 109. Inside the cavity, local and instantaneous air temperatures were measured with two thermocouples. Furthermore, the 2 D velocity fields in several vertical planes were obtained using a LDV- 2 D device. Laser tomography was also used to visualise specific behaviour of the flow, particularly {{in the vicinity of the}} corners. By analysing the thermal field, the bottom part of the cavity is not affected by the lintel. The stratification parameter is always 0. 37. However, in the top left quarter of the cavity, upstream of the lintel, the stratification is very large, whereas, downstream of the obstacle, it is weaker than without a lintel. Velocity profiles show that the mean flow closely follows the walls, including the lintel, without any apparent separation. This confirms a fundamental property of natural convection flows. Moreover, these velocity profiles highlight the presence of significant recirculating flows, located in the core of the cavity, especially at the bottom and also at the top, on each side of the lintel. These big structures induce 3 D secondary flows. They appear more intense in the case of a cavity provided with a lintel...|$|R
40|$|Subsidences {{in ground}} surface {{are caused by}} collapses of {{underground}} cavities by internal erosion with ground water percolation around and through the cavity. During the last few decades, there is an increased record of road cave-in accidents. Specially, many road cave-ins were caused by underground cavities developed through defects in buried sewer and drain pipes. Researchers have found that, {{there is a tendency}} of forming cave-ins when the age of buried pipe exceeds 25 years. Hence, vulnerability of road cave-in accidents is increasing all over the world, with most of the buried sewer and drain lines reaching their lifespan. Although modern techniques like Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Geoelectric Tomography are available to detect the subsurface cavities, those technologies can only identify air filled voids separately from soil and having many other limitations. Maximum depth which can accurately detect is limited to few meters; in clayey and high moist soils this will be further limited to 1 - 1. 5 m maximum. Therefore, {{it is very difficult to}} detect cavities in deeper ground and it can ultimately cause ground subsidence by expansion towards the surface. Cavities are generally associated with process of loosening around it. Therefore, it will be better in detecting the loosened soil conjunction with air-filled cavity, rather than targeting air-filled cavity only. Thereby, even cavities in deeper ground can be detected by signs of capturing the loosened region in the subsurface. This will lead to improve the accuracy and efficiency of current methods in inexpensive manner. At present, cavity formation, extents of loosening and mechanical properties of loosened soil around cavity are not well addressed. There are several objectives of this study. First is to understand the extents of loosening with respect to the potential cavity size and to identify the parameters which affect the scale and rate of loosening. An attempt was made to create loosened soil in laboratory by dissolving water soluble material of pre-selected size and shape in Toyoura sand. The above mentioned objectives were achieved by conducting series of two-dimensional model tests by introducing a potential cavity and forming loosening by expanding the cavity by water infiltration and drainage. Effect of cavity size, density, ground compaction and rate of drainage on loosening and cavity expansion was studied through the two dimensional tests. As the second part of the study, quantitative study on mechanical properties of loosened soil was evaluated by triaxial tests after forming ground loosening inside the specimen. Simultaneously, influence of density, cavity size and location on scale of loosening was studied by changing conditions of the experiment. In each test, variation of axial strain, radial strain and volumetric strain during process of loosening was obtained and Poisson's ratio and shear modulus of loosened sand was evaluated. Furthermore, extent of loosening in triaxial specimen was studied by X-ray CT scan, in order to compare the different behaviour in two dimensional and three dimensional responses. Results obtained for Toyoura sand from two dimensional model tests show that, height of the loosened region is extending up to five times of cavity height and radial expansion is limited compared to vertical expansion. Furthermore, It was found that ground collapse around the potential cavity was higher when the cavity was located above the ground water table rather than beneath the water table. Cavity formed in compacted or dense soil was more stable compared to loose soil and extents of loosening were proportional to cavity size. Further observed that, suction supports the stability of cavity and abrupt failure of <b>cavity</b> <b>ceiling</b> was caused by rapid drainage. Extent of loosening was nearly limited to two times of the initial cavity height in triaxial tests. Density has affected the axial and radial deformations caused by loosening and lower density (Dr= 37 %) samples were observed with four times larger strains than medium dense samples (Dr= 63 %). Similarly, lower confining pressure (50 kPa) shows nearly three times larger deformations than high confining pressure (100 kPa). Loose sand and coarse sand (Silica) was subjected to further propagation of loosening under repetitive infiltration on already loosened soil. Evaluated Poisson's ratio of loosened sand shows complex variation throughout the entire test and difficult to understand the relationship with scale of loosening. This might be due to non-uniform distribution of soil and voids. Parametric study showed that Young's modulus of loosened region was 50 - 60 % of the non-loosened region. Overall stiffness of ground with loosening was 70 - 85 % of stiffness of controlled specimen. As a conclusion the cavities in subsurface are more vulnerable for cave-in and loosening expands at least twice of the cavity height. Overall stiffness of the ground is decreasing significantly even by having a smaller void. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士（工学）; 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科社会基盤学専...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} anthropological {{data on the}} Upper Paleolithic skeletons from Grotta Santa Maria d’Agnano in Ostuni (BR) {{and describes}} their anatomical characteristics {{in the context of}} remains from the same time period. The importance of the cave as a burial site was identified in the autumn of 1991 by Donato Coppola who noticed a few human bones in the roof of a small cavity existing below the floor of the upper cave of Santa Maria d’Agnano. This unique situation, resulting from the partial natural erosion of the deposit underlying the burial, had exposed and made visible from below various elements of an adult human skeleton (Ostuni 1) and some elements of a foetal skeleton (Ostuni 1 b). The precarious conditions of the deposit and of the remains (which seemed to be suspended on the <b>ceiling</b> of the <b>cavity),</b> as well as the need to preserve the two skeletons in the original position required isolation and rapid removal of the bulk of sediment containing the burial. During this phase, a second burial (Ostuni 2), located not far from the first but not visible in the ceiling of the lower cavity, necessitated further preservation. Two blocks of sediment containing the burials were removed and transported in the Museum of ‘Civiltà Preclassiche’ in Ostuni where the subsequent work took place. The state of preservation of the remains and maintenance of the mutual positions of the skeletal elements within the deposit, attest the success and efficiency of the recovery operations. The second burial of Grotta Santa Maria d’Agnano was completely embedded in a very tough concrete-like sediment, impossible to remove without damaging the bones. The skeleton, probably lying prevalently on its right side, and in a flexed position, belongs to an adult individual, based on dental eruption and wear. Sex can not be diagnosed. The remains from the first burial, due to the less concretionary nature of deposit, were in an excellent state of preservation and not too difficult to isolate. This burial is very peculiar, including the remains of a young woman in advanced state of pregnancy. These remains therefore refer to a maternal skeleton (Ostuni 1) and to a foetal skeleton (Ostuni 1 b). The maternal skeleton was lying on its left side and in a flexed position. The lower limb bones were flexed both at the hip and knee. The right forearm was placed across the abdominal area with the hand resting on the left ilium. The left arm was completely flexed and the hand was placed under the cranium that was laid on the left side and facing downwards. The foetal skeleton was found in the maternal abdominal area. The elements of the cranial vault, in particular the parietals, were recovered under the right maternal pubic bone and not far from the foetal mandible. In correspondence to the maternal promontory, on the ventral face of the first sacral element, the foetal upper limb bones were found approximately in anatomical connection and strongly flexed. The thoracic elements were lying in part on the sacrum, i. e. in the lower region of the maternal iliac cavity, while the foetal spine appear oriented along the longitudinal axis of the maternal body. Cranially, on the left iliac crest, the diaphyses of the tibia and fibula were found partly covered by the right maternal radius. The foetal femurs and the two iliac portions of the pelvis were located at the extremity of and lateral to the foetal tibia, and nearly touching the distal portion of the right maternal radius. The foetal head, therefore, occupied the lesser pelvis while the body and the limbs were found approximately in the greater pelvis. The maternal skeleton is almost complete. Only a few hand bones are missing, while most of the foot bones are still embedded in the sediments; minor loss occurred in the basilar part of the occipital bone and in the facial and orbital areas. The state of conservation of the remains is good. The Ostuni 1 skeleton is certainly among the most complete and best preserved specimen from the Gravettian period. Anthropological study of the skeleton indicates that metric and morphological characteristics of Ostuni 1 fit well in the variability of Upper Paleolithic European female remains. Cranial measurements do not exceed one standard deviation from the mean of the comparative female sample, with the only exception of the orbital height which is much lower. The extraordinary circumstances and complex recovery technique that enabled the preservation of maternal-foetal anatomical relations make the Ostuni 1 remains particularly important from a methodo¬logical perspective. Since the sex of this individual is known, the focus is on how female characteristics are expressed in an Upper Paleolithic specimen. Morphologic and metric analyses of the sexually differentiated structure of the pelvis reveal, with respect to modern standards, clear female characteristics particularly for the ischio-pubic region. The results provided by the sacro-iliac region are less clear, probably due to the role these anatomical components play in locomotion and load bearing. The estimated age at death, based on degree of epiphysial fusion, cranial suture synostosis, dental eruption and wear and on the morphology of the pubic simphysis, point to a young adult age not exceeding 20 years. Due to its excellent state of conservation, the Ostuni 1 skeleton provides additional possibilities for methodological tests. The preservation of the bony elements contributing to determine stature allows the application of the so-called ‘anatomic method’, producing good approximation of the actual stature. The “anatomical” estimate has been compared with those obtained from equations based on the correlation between bone length and stature. Among the equations tested, those published by Formicola and Franceschi (1996), Olivier and coll. (1978), and by Trotter and Gleser (1952) for Afro-Americans, provide estimates close to the anatomical value. The resulting stature of 171 cm represents one of the highest values found in the European Upper Palaeolithic female sample. With regard to body proportions, ratios between limb segments indicate a relatively long distal part of the upper limb, as is typical in Gravettian and subsequent Upper Paleolithic samples. In modern populations, proportions similar to those found in Ostuni 1 characterize North Africans and are quite different from those exhibited by European groups. Regarding the lower limb, however, the distal segment of Ostuni 1 is not elongated and the proportions are therefore more similar to those of modern Europeans than to those of Upper Paleolithic and recent North African groups. Consequently, while the femur/trunk ratio indicates a short trunk as in recent North Africans and Early Upper Paleolithic (Gravettian) samples, the tibia/trunk ratio provides a different picture. In summary, the presence of an elongated body build in Ostuni 1 is shown in the proportions of the upper limb and relative shortness of the trunk with respect to the femur, but not in the relation of tibia to femur and trunk lengths. The post-cranial skeleton of Ostuni 1 is in general quite robust, based on muscular insertions and bone remodeling. Metrical robusticity of the humeri denotes an asymmetry, which is evident also {{in the development of the}} muscular insertions, more marked on the right. The lower limb bones do not show elevated levels of robusticity, as measured by external diaphyseal circumferences relative to bone length. The degree of robusticity of femur and tibia, in comparison to other Italian female samples, is moderate. However both bones show characteristics indicative of intense activity such as a third trochanter, an ipotrochanteric fossa, accentuated linea aspera with very elevated pilasteric index, and very prominent inter¬osseous crest and tuberosity on the tibia and deep grooves on the fibula. The state of preservation of the foetal remains (Ostuni 1 b) is also exceptionally good, considering the fragility of a skeleton in a very precocious stage of development. Ostuni 1 b, in spite of the loss of a few elements (shoulder blades, clavicle, most of the cervical elements of the spinal column and the first costal elements) preserves in general at least one of the paired bones. It is likely that while a few elements were lost when part of the sediment collapsed, the pelvis of the mother prevented the fall under the burial of most of the foetal remains. The preservation of this precious and fragile skeleton, surviving natural and human events over such a considerable period of time, was made possible also thanks to the conservation and protection efforts carried out immediately after the discovery. The efficiency of this intervention is stressed by the maintenance of the maternal-foetal anatomical relations which are typically established during pregnancy. To describe their arrangement, the definition of the foetal position given by a midwife’s manual can be used effectively: ‘body ventrally flexed; head flexed towards the trunk, upper limbs adducted; forearms flexed towards the arms and crossed in front at the level of the sternum, thighs flexed over the abdomen; legs flexed towards the thighs and crossed in front of the ventral plane’ (Pescetto et al., 1986). It can be concluded that the foetal remains Ostuni 1 b were found in situ both from an archaeological point of view and from the point of view of their anatomical relation with the maternal skeleton. The degree of foetal development has been calculated using all the available measurements. Compared to modern standards, the resulting stage of development of Ostuni 1 b, points to a foetal age between 8. 5 (34 weeks) and 9 lunar months (36 weeks), and presumably in the later part of this period. The foetal length (vertex-calcaneum), determined on the basis of dimensions of the better preserved elements from the various skeletal regions provided an average value of around 45. 4 cm. This value corresponds to the empirical value obtained from modern samples at a foetal development of 9 months (lunar). Compared with modern samples, sciatic notch proportions and shape of Ostuni 1 b suggests female sex. The general morphology of Ostuni 1 b does not differ from modern European standards with the exception of specific population characteristics (e. g. body proportions). Other possible elements of ontogenetic differentiation, such as differential growth rates for the various skeletal regions, as suggested by discrepancies in the development observed in some bone elements, could result from individual variations or from population differences. Studies of paleo-ontogeny are very problematic as they are based on incomplete and fragmented remains, dispersed in time and not necessarily rep¬resentative of their parent populations. Thus, generalizations on this subject are of little use. However, the foetal remains of Ostuni, considering their completeness and excellent state of preservation, provide important and additional information on the issue of growth and development of immature remains from that period. Sites and human remains recovered in Italy have contributed significantly to the knowledge of biology of European Paleolithic and Mesolithic populations, but this is particularly true as far as the Upper Paleolithic is concerned. In such a context, the site and the human remains from Santa Maria d’Agnano in Ostuni (BR), provide highly significant and spectacular evidence...|$|R
