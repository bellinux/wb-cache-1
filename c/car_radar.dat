40|$|This thesis work {{consists}} of two research projects. The first project presented is on waveform design for <b>car</b> <b>radars.</b> These radars are used to detect other vehicles to avoid collision. In this project, we attempt {{to find the best}} waveform that distinguishes large objects from small ones. This helps the radar system reach more reliable decisions. We consider several models of the problem with varying complexity. For each model, we present optimization results calculated under various constraints regarding how the waveform is generated and how the reflected signal is processed. The results show that changing the radar waveform can result in better target classification. The second project is about digital-to-analog converter (DAC) linearization. Ideally, DACs have a linear input-output relation. In practice, however, this relation is nonlinear which may be harmful for many applications. A more linear input-output relation can be achieved by modifying the input to a DAC. This method, called predistortion, requires a good understanding of how DAC errors contribute to the nonlinearity. Assuming a simple DAC model, we investigate how different error functions lead to different types of nonlinearities through theoretical analyses and supporting computer simulations. We present our results in terms of frequency spectrum calculations. We show that the nonlinearity observed at the output strongly depends on how the error is modeled. These results are helpful in designing a predistorter for linearization...|$|R

40|$|Bipolar Transistors (HBTs) in a CMOS platform. This {{technology}} is at present contender for demanding high speed applications like 60 GHz ultra-wide band communication and 77 GHz <b>car</b> <b>radar.</b> For applications beyond these operating frequencies, the so-called terahertz or submillimeter frequency range, roughly defined as extending from 200 GHz to 30 THz, SiGe:C HBTs might play a rolewith devices having fT and fmax higher than 500 GHz. This PhD {{work is a}} feasibility study on how to realize such performance through vertical profile engineering, lateral architecture exploration and lateral scaling. Based {{on the concept of}} regional transit time analysis, the vertical profile is engineered with respect to different regions to reduce the transit time and improve the RF performances. Different architectures have been studied. The conventional quasi-self aligned (QSA) architecture has demonstrated its possibility of pushing fmax up to 300 GHz through optimization of the external poly base. Three self-aligned architectures have been studied based on TCAD. It has been demonstrated that with aggressive lateral scaling, these architectures could reach an fmax of 500 GHz. For the conventionalself-aligned HBT, this could only be reached by decreasing the resistivity of the external base layer. As practical realizations of these self-aligned architectures are subject to the technological limitations in comparison with the theoretical TCAD structures, it is expected that the realized performance is a bit below the TCAD predicted performance. For a newly proposed architecture (G 1 G), the actual 460 GHz fmax performance was close to the predicted performance. For a novel device architecture with a low-parasitic collector construction, an fmax of effectively 500 GHz could be reached. This PhD also works on some limitations of the very high speed SiGe:C HBTs, for example the break-down voltage BVCEO (breakdown between collector and monocrystalline emitter close to the emitter-base junction is investigated, which shows that the SiGe spike in the monoemitter improves the breakdown voltage without sacrificing the RF performances. fT and fmax are commonly used figures-of-merit of transistors on the device level. However on the circuit level, other parasitics also need to be considered, for example the collector-substrate capacitance. This thesis investigates the impact of isolation schemes on the collector-substrate capacitance as well as the thermal resistance. nrpages: 192 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Ultra-wideband (UWB) {{signals and}} {{systems have been}} {{actively}} investigated {{over the past decade}} for both medical and industrial radar applications. Recent UWB radars, capable of measuring distance have been investigated most since only time information needs to be recovered. Targeted applications include object detection, collision avoidance in <b>car</b> <b>radar</b> or vital signs monitoring. For high accuracy in advanced applications, it is however needed to sample the entire UWB pulse directly instead of only performing energy detection since the former signal has more information about the target besides its location. This allows a visualization of the inside of objects and exploit the true benefit of electromagnetic (EM) imaging. For instance, in the application of breast cancer detection, this would reveal more information of the tumour and enhance dielectric contrast. In this work, the proposed application of remotely sensing the effect of radiation is investigated by proof-of-concept measurements. For communication purposes, UWB channel models are widely investigated in terms of bit error rate (BER). For radar applications, few models are available to derive hardware specifications and analyze the impact of different error sources. Different applications will also demand different hardware specifications which need to be predicted. To this end, a design methodology is investigated to derive receiver hardware parametersnbsp;on changes in reflected target responses due to anbsp;complex permittivity. These reflections can be calculated using the investigated 1 -D model or as an extension be simulated in 2 -D or 3 -D by commercial EM solvers. In order to allow proof-of-concept measurements, the design of UWBnbsp;is also included. It is shown that the antenna design is equally important at systemnbsp;and can relax othernbsp;requirements. Two main types are investigated: a vivaldi antenna arraynbsp;free-space measurements and a stacked-patch antenna matched for in-body measurements. Several complex permittivity measurement setups are further discussednbsp;allow a comparison between the impulse radio (IR) -UWB time domain reflectometry (TDR) signals and the frequency domain data from a vector networknbsp;(VNA) as a secondarynbsp;setup. A second main research activity besides the system level exploration and proof-of-concept measurements, is the investigation of hardware techniques to allownbsp;technology for these applications. On the transmitter side, an FPGA based approach is presented tonbsp;flexible pulse generation and rapid prototyping. On the receiver side, the bandwidth-resolution trade-off is analyzed for the analog-to-digitalnbsp;(ADC). It is shown that the effect of clock feedthrough on the RF-switch in the track-and-hold (T/H) is the dominant error source. Nyquist ADCs with GHz input BW are power hungry and require extensive calibration. Only recently Time-Interleavednbsp;Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADCs are capable of achievingnbsp;resolution at GHz frequencies, but also require calibration. On the other hand,nbsp;(ET) sampling can be justified fornbsp;targeted medical and industrial radar applications where thenbsp;pulses are repetitive over multiple symbols. Thanks to ET-sampling, a less complex, yet very flexible receiver architecture is achieved. Two realizations in 40 nm CMOS are presented. The first chip consists of a wideband rail-to-rail T/H ET-sampler achieving 5. 8 -b accuracy at a resolution bandwidth of 5. 5 GHz. Techniques such asnbsp;hold capacitor precharging, bootstrapping and non-overlapping clocks are analyzed. The wideband T/H is directly loaded with a fully differential unity gain output buffer. The latter is capable of drivingOmega; loads while achieving a low input capacitance of only 10 fF. The second 40 nm chip covers a wideband SAR ADC with an analog feedback replica technique for resolution enhancement. The novelty of this design relies on the proposed replicanbsp;technique which is an improved architecture compared to a conventional SAR ADC in terms of resolution. Thereby omitting the need for extensive calibration. Based on measurement results, the effective resolution bandwidth (ERBW) is extended from 0. 9 GHz up to 1. 6 GHz, while achieving a resolution of 4 -b without any calibration. status: publishe...|$|E

Today it is recognized that manufacturability is not the limiting factor with regards to the small size of the devices and that major challenge is the power dissipation problem. Spray cooling has been shown as a possible solution for cooling of high heat fluxes systems. However, the Leidenfrost phenomena pose a limitation to the use of liquid to cool down hot surfaces as it prevents the dissipation of heat. This effect consists of the development of a vapor layer that makes the impinging cooling fluid bounce away when impacting the hot surface, becoming heat dissipation ineffective. This regime is named film boiling.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of wireless technology today shows an increasing need for electromagnetic components operating at even higher frequencies. Higher frequencies offer wider bandwidth, higher spatial resolution and {{are needed for}} technologies such as automotive <b>car</b> <b>radars,</b> wireless media communication and body scanners. The biggest issues with developing high frequency components are the small dimensions needed. With the small dimensions, issues with connectivity and resolution of the structures have become difficult to handle at frequencies above 100 GHz. The most common fabrication method used is micro-milling in brass, however this is limited in its resolution and micro-milling is not a mass production method, thus making it expensive. This thesis aims to realize electromagnetic components at high frequencies, more specific above 100 GHz, {{with the help of}} microsystem technology. The thesis covers a background and history of the field, a discussion of the technologies used, and presents the fabricated devices, made with microsystem technology. In this thesis, gap waveguides ranging from 100 - 325 GHz, gap adapters, and transitions fabricated with microsystem technology have been explored. Three different materials: silicon, SU 8, and carbon nanotubes, have been tested as base materials together with a gold surface, for a gap waveguide component. The silicon-based structure performed overall the best, while the SU 8 process was less costly, the carbon nanotube based structure was determined to be the lossiest of these realizations. The knowledge obtained from these fundamental structures were used to fabricate and measure a ridge gap antenna prototype. A gap adapter was used to connect to the antenna, to reduce leakage without using damaging screws. The antenna, was fabricated in silicon for 100 GHz. A new transition, based on the knowledge of previous transitions was used to connect the waveguide flange to the feed of the antenna.

40|$|The {{launch of}} SAR {{satellites}} with high resolution and dual receive antenna capabilities opens new possibilities for traffic monitoring applications {{on a global}} scale. Thus {{it will be possible}} to detect cars and measure their speed from the acquired along track interferometric data. The development of vehicle detection algorithms requires the knowledge of the radar signatures of vehicles, especially under consideration of the geometry of the radar look direction and the vehicle orientation. In this paper the radar signatures of the non-moving cars are presented. They are estimated experimentally from airborne E-SAR multi-frequency and polarimetric data, which have been collected during a flight campaign in 2003. Radar signatures are estimated for a considerable part of aspect angles ranging from 0 º to 180 º. The large synthetic aperture length of the E-SAR radar sensor allows the look processing of data and therefore allows an increase of the aspect angle resolution. The radar signature analysis for one type of passenger cars showed that the largest radar cross section values and thus the greatest chance for high probability of detection are for cars standing in rear and front view of radar beam direction. This holds true for all frequencies and co-polarizations. Radar cross section values for cross-polarizations and diagonal views are much lower and are therefore less suitable for <b>car</b> detection.
