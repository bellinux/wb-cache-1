50|$|A fill trestle or filling trestle is a {{temporary}} <b>construction</b> <b>trestle</b> that is built to provide a scaffolding for the placement of fill or an earthen dam. Typically, the trestle is built across the valley and a railway is laid across the trestle. Specially designed side-dumping railroad cars filled with earth or gravel are pushed onto it and dumped, burying the trestle. Typically, a fill trestle is constructed out of wood which remains buried in the fill and eventually decomposes. Advances in construction technology, particularly {{the development of the}} dump truck, have rendered the fill trestle technique obsolete.|$|E
40|$|Bridge {{replacement}} project minimized sensitive resource impacts {{and constructed}} a bridge designed to last 75 years. As {{a result of}} the New Years Eve/Day storm of 2005 / 2006, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) had to close to all traffic the Russian River Bridge, a two-lane conventional highway east of Geyserville due to significant structural damage. This Bridge, constructed in 1932, is a 973. 5 -foot-long steel pony truss bridge located on State Highway 128 and connects the Counties of Sonoma and Napa. Pier 2 of the Bridge was damaged during Russian River storm flows approaching 60, 000 cubic feet per second (CFS). This damage consisted of the through and through cracking of the pier cap and web wall of Pier 2, the rotation of the pier in the downstream direction, and the dropping of the pony trusses approximately 9 inches. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), at the request of Caltrans, through its Damage Assessment procedures, determined that this Bridge could be rebuilt under the Emergency Opening provisions of 23 CFR 771. 117 (c) (9).

In order to demolish the existing bridge a <b>construction</b> <b>trestle,</b> capable of supporting a 250 -ton crane, had to be con¬structed across the Russian River. This crane would be utilized to construct the trestle from land, demolish the damaged pony truss bridge, and construct the new bridge. The 50 ’-wide trestle was supported on 24 ” steel pipe piles averaging 80 ’ in length. The <b>construction</b> <b>trestle,</b> being constructed from both the east and west sides of the river, totaled 465 feet in length, and was completed in 70 days. Piles were primarily driven with a vibratory hammer or within an isolation casing, to reduce the impact on salmonids [Central California Coastal Steelhead (CCCS) (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and California Coastal Chinook salmon (CCCO) (O. tshawytscha) ] which are known to inhabit this reach of the Russian River. During the time that the trestle was being constructed, Caltrans bridge engineers, designers, and environmental personnel completed the Plans Specifications & Estimate (PS&E) for the new bridge in approximately 4 weeks. Once construction of the trestle was completed, demolition of the existing bridge began. Demolition commenced with the removal of the concrete deck, lifting of the pony trusses, and the toppling of the old piers. These piers were founded on 12 ” diameter 25 ’ long Douglas fir piles and there were 18 piles per pier. Once the piers were toppled, the Douglas fir piles were either extracted from the river bed or cut off approximately 3 ’ below the grade of the gravel bar. To the greatest extent possible, all demolition debris was prevented from falling into the river or onto the dry river bed. Hydroacoustic monitoring was conducted during pile driving activities within the wetted channel or within 30 ’ of the wetted channel. Recordings of the 24 ” trestle piles driven with the vibratory hammer could not be distinguished from the ambient river noise which ranged up to 170 dB (re 1 μPa) RMS. Diesel hammer driving of the 24 ” piles resulted in readings ranging up to 190 dB peak. Driving of the 48 ” steel shell production pipe piles to depths of up to 140 ’ resulted, in some cases, of readings up to 210 dB peak, even though the piles were being driven in a dewatered isolation casing. Construction of the new bridge, on the same alignment of the damaged and demolished bridge, began on May 1, 2006. The bridge was opened to all traffic on August 18 th, 2006, a total of 110 days. Extensive coordination with the resource agencies (Army Corps of Engineers, Regional Water Quality Control Board, California Department of Fish and Game, and the National Marine Fisheries Service) was continuous throughout the entire construction period. A full time biological monitor was on site beginning in the middle of May. Caltrans personnel relocated to the main river channel trapped fish from the pools that remained after the demolition of the piers. Deconstruction of the trestle, including the extraction of the 24 ” piles, was completed in 15 days. Total construction costs were $ 26 million broken down as follows: $ 10. 5 M for the trestle, old bridge demolition, and pipe piles; $ 14 M for the new bridge; and $ 1. 5 M for contract change orders and landscaping. Caltrans, as compensation for impacts to Russian River fisheries due to this project, established a $ 2, 500, 000 fund to enhance and restore appropriate salmonid fisheries habitat within the Russian River watershed...|$|E

50|$|The ongoing cost of {{construction}} crews, crossing mountains, rivers and the Canadian Shield completely undid construction estimates and the CPR was nearly bankrupt in 1885. To prevent financial ruin CPR crews stopped building in masonry and steel, opting for tree-pole <b>construction</b> with bridge <b>trestles</b> built from nearby trees. Snowsheds, easy routings and sidings were omitted to reduce costs. Only {{the intervention of}} Lord Revelstoke of Barings Bank of London with another loan gave the CPR enough financing to finish the job. The greatest disadvantage of the route was in Kicking Horse Pass. In the first 6 km west of the 1,625-metre(5,330 ft)-high summit, the Kicking Horse River drops 350 metres (1,150 ft). The steep drop would force the cash-strapped CPR to build a 7-km(4.5 mile)-long stretch of track with a very steep 4.5% gradient when it reached the pass in 1884. This was over four times the maximum gradient recommended for railways of this era; even modern railways rarely exceed a 2% gradient. However, this route was far more direct than one through the Yellowhead Pass and saved hours for both passengers and freight. This section of track was the Big Hill. Safety switches were installed at several points, the speed limit for descending trains was set at 10 km per hour (6 mph) and special locomotives were ordered. Despite these measures, several serious runaways still occurred. CPR officials insisted {{that this was a}} temporary expediency, but this state of affairs would last for 25 years until the completion of the Spiral Tunnels in the early 20th century.|$|R

5000|$|The viaduct was {{effectively}} a <b>trestle</b> <b>construction</b> with 193 spans of 30 feet (9.14 m); each pier consisted of five cast iron columns of hollow section, 12 inches (305 mm) diameter; the outer columns were raked, acting as buttresses {{to the three}} inner load-bearing columns. The columns were founded on iron tubular piles that were driven by a steam pile driver, after an unsuccessful attempt to screw them in to the substrate. Originally, the viaduct was to be of 80 30-foot spans, the railway being carried on a solid embankment {{as far as the}} low-water mark on either side. A 36-foot opening span was to be provided to allow the passage of small craft to the upper Solway ( [...] chiefly to Port Carlisle); the Board of Trade however objected to so major an obstruction to tidal flows and required a 50-foot opening span to allow the passage of steam tugs. The promoters accepted both objections at first, but the Bill of 1867 made no provision for an opening span, the promoters arguing that the traffic of Port Carlisle was negligible and {{should not be allowed to}} compromise the viaduct design. This argument won the day; although the Board of Trade confirmed its earlier stand that the traffic of Port Carlisle was not negligible, Parliament was persuaded that it was insignificant in comparison to the projected traffic over the viaduct and as built the viaduct made no provision for ships to pass through it; this ended any commercial use of the harbour at Port Carlisle.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Dong Lam Cement Factory is {{developing}} a new clinker plant in Thua Thien-Hue Province, Vietnam. The clinker has to be exported towards Ho Chi Minh City, where it is grinded into cement and used for the construction industry. For the clinker production coal is needed {{and has to be}} imported. To make the in- and export possible a new dedicated seaport is required to allow for 15, 000 dwt clinker vessels and 7, 000 dwt coal vessels. Objective The objective is to design a port with sufficient capacity to handle the predicted cargo flow and which offers acceptable conditions for the ships to enter. The effective berth and hinterland capacity have to be determined such, that turnaround times are within limits. To create safe conditions, the vessels need to have enough space for manouevring in the wet port area. These manoeuvres can be seriously disturbed by wind, wave, currents and siltation on the long term. To ensure the workability of the port these effects have to be limited. Analysis To determine the effective berth capacity the queuing theory is applied. In phase 1 and 2 one clinker and one coal berth satisfy with effective capacities of respectively 700 and 175 t/h respectively. In phase 3 two clinker and two coal berths are needed with the same loading/unloading rates. To get insight in the environmental boundary conditions, field data is collected and analysed thoroughly. In Vietnam the wind climate is governed by the South-East Asian monsoon system, with a dominant SE direction and strong NNE winds. The wave climate is directly influenced by the wind climate and shows a similar pattern. With regard to extreme conditions, once a year a tropical storm lands {{in the vicinity of the}} port site. These storms are accompanied by strong wave conditions, coming from E to SE direction. Having frequent waves from the NNE and SE, littoral transport is generated in north- and southward direction. Nevertheless, the northward transport is clearly dominant. Currents are heading SE for most of the time. Synthesis Four different layouts are developed for phase 3 of the project. Two of them are dismissed in an early stage, because of unfavourable conditions. The other two layouts – the 'coastal' and 'offshore' alternative, are evaluated with a cost-value approach. In this approach the value of each design is assessed by means of a MCA. Evaluation The following criteria are taken into consideration: navigation, tranquillity at berth, coastal impact, sedimentation, ease of cargo handling, safety and flexibility. Regarding navigation and wind, wave and current hindrance, no significant differences are found. It turns out that the most important difference is found in the coastal impact. The coastal alternative will cause erosion along 7. 5 km of coastline with a maximum retreat of 100 m. Instead, the offshore alternative affects 'only' 3 km with maximum retreat of 70 m. The other element of the cost-value approach is the costs. The investment costs for the coastal alternative are 64. 1 M$, which include the dredging works, breakwater and quay construction. The costs for the offshore port amount 77. 5 M$, which entails the dredging works, breakwater, jetty quay and <b>trestle</b> <b>construction.</b> The relative low costs for the coastal alternative are achieved by applying the cut-and-fill balance; the dredged sand is used as breakwater foundation. Maintenance dredging costs are 1. 75 M$ and 0. 9 M$ for respectively the coastal and offshore alternative. To finish the cost-value approach the value/costs ratio is taken for both port layouts. The coastal alternative (0. 9) turns out to be a better port layout than the offshore alternative (0. 77). Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
