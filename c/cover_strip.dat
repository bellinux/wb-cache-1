25|$|T.V. Boardman, Ltd., was {{but one of}} many London {{publishing}} houses {{turning out}} both paperback and hardcover books, pulp magazines, and comics. Boardman pioneered British reprinting of American comics. During the week of 16 October 1937, {{the first issue of}} a Boardman tabloid comic in the traditional British format, Okay Comics Weekly, arrived at newsagents all over England. The content was mostly American newspaper strips and the first issue sported a <b>cover</b> <b>strip</b> by Will Eisner. Okay lasted only until 26 February 1938, or a total of twenty issues. At about this same time, other British publishers experimented with reprinting American comics and imports of the real thing began to land on British shores. It rapidly became apparent that a significant British market for American comic books existed.|$|E

50|$|Carolyn R. Mobley is an {{inventor}} who patented a tab construction for a sanitary napkin. Her {{idea was to}} add a pressure-sensitive adhesive strip {{near the end of}} the tab, covered with a fairly stiff <b>cover</b> <b>strip.</b> This stiffness makes the tab easier to thread through the clasp or grip of a sanitary belt. The woman then removes the <b>cover</b> <b>strip</b> and uses the adhesive patch to roll up the napkin for disposal.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the major}} land cover issues (as with all natural {{resource}} inventories) is that every survey defines similarly named categories in different ways. For instance, there are many definitions of [...] "forest"—sometimes within the same organisation—that {{may or may not}} incorporate a number of different forest features (e.g., stand height, canopy <b>cover,</b> <b>strip</b> width, inclusion of grasses, and rates of growth for timber production). Areas without trees may be classified as forest cover [...] "if the intention is to re-plant" [...] (UK and Ireland), while areas with many trees may not be labelled as forest [...] "if the trees are not growing fast enough" [...] (Norway and Finland).|$|E
50|$|Eric Stephens (1909-2001) was a British {{comic strip}} artist {{who contributed to}} Jack and Jill, drawing episodes of the <b>cover</b> <b>strip</b> 'Jack and Jill of Buttercup Farm' and {{colouring}} a number of centre-spread features such as 'There Was An Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe' and 'Our Village'.

5000|$|The comic has had {{a number}} of {{different}} cover stars (comic strips appearing on the front cover), firstly Korky the Cat, who was on the cover from 1937 - 1984. Desperate Dan, long since the comic's most popular character, then took over the cover, a position he retained until 1999 when he was replaced as cover star by Cuddles and Dimples. However, they were not on the cover for very long and Desperate Dan had been restored to the cover by the end of 2000. The comic revealed that Cuddles and Dimples were thrown off the cover for [...] "being too naughty", though in reality the comic's readers wanted Dan to return as the <b>cover</b> <b>strip.</b> In 2004, following a major revamp, Desperate Dan was replaced on the front cover by Jak, a character created for the cover, slightly based on an older strip with the same name, although other characters, including Dan, also made occasional cover appearances. The front cover also had a subtitle, for example, [...] "Better than the Beano". During the Dandy Xtreme era the comic had no cover star, and covers were often given over to celebrities or current trends, but after the comic returned to its weekly, all-comic format in October 2010, the popular British comedian Harry Hill took over the cover spot, accompanied by Desperate Dan and Bananaman in some issues (although other characters made one-off appearances too).|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{retains its}} original partitions, constructed of cement plaster on vertical steel rods and metal lathe. The {{rooms on the}} enclosed front and rear verandahs have walls lined with vertically jointed tongue and groove boards The ceilings throughout {{the core of the}} building are lined with flat sheet and timber cover battens in a simple geometric pattern and on the upper level there are ventilation panels that have been sheeted closed with the grille potentially surviving behind. The ceilings to the enclosed verandah are lined with vertically jointed tongue and groove boards {{with the exception of the}} front ground floor which has a ceiling lined with ripple iron. No original ceiling fittings have been retained with modern light fixtures and ceiling fans found throughout. The cornice is a square, timber <b>cover</b> <b>strip.</b> Internally, windows and doors have distinctive, tapered timber architraves. Generally the doors have 3 panels and are high-waisted, and almost all retain their original hardware including keyhole covers. Those opening onto the now enclosed verandahs are French with low waists and twelve lights in the upper section of each leaf. Door panel mouldings and skirtings differ between the original building and later extension. Windows, where original, are multi-paned, retain original hardware, and most have had their glass painted out. The skirtings are timber and are a simple ogee in the oldest part and a simple splay in the 1938 extension. The floors are linoleum sheets and tiles, or carpet throughout. The original crows ash timber flooring may survive underneath. The central spaces on both levels have chair rails and the first floor waiting area contains a picture rail.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{represented}} {{the numerical analysis}} of the tunnel lining which was used for maintaining the old tunnel. The tunnel lining was made from FRP corrugated sheet that supported the lining concrete in the tunnel and flowed the water or / and the moisture swept on the tunnel surface. The FRP sheet {{was supported by the}} anchor bolts. In numerical analysis, the finite element degenerate shell was adopted to represent the FRP behavior. Firstly, the proposed FRP sheet was adopted and the distribute load equivalent to the concrete peeled from the tunnel lining was applied and the stresses of the FRP sheet, the tensile force of bolts and the deflection of FRP sheet were investigated. Then, secondary, the FRP corrugated sheet with longitudinal <b>cover</b> <b>strip</b> was investigated. From the numerical analysis, the effectiveness of the FRP corrugated sheet was confirmed...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Glutaraldehyde {{fixation}} {{does not}} guarantee complete tissue biocompatibility in current clinical bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs). Particularly, circulating anti-αGal human antibodies increase significantly from just 10 days after a BHV implantation. The inactivation of such epitope should be mandatory {{to meet the requirements}} for a perspectively safe clinical application; nevertheless, its quantitative assessment in commercially available BHVs has never been carried out. METHODS: In this investigation, seven different models of BHVs were tested. The number of epitopes was determined with reference to a standard αGal source by an ELISA test. The presence of xenoantigen was subsequently confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis. Porcine tissue, knockout for the αGal epitopes, was used as negative control. RESULTS: Epic™ valve was the only model among those tested, in which the αGal antigen appeared to be completely shielded. Composite Trifecta™ valve exhibited conflicting results: cusps of bovine pericardial tissue were devoid of reactive αGal epitopes, while the stent <b>cover</b> <b>strip</b> of porcine pericardium still maintained 30...|$|E
