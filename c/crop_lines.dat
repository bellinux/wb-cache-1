The UAV ortho-mosaics are turning into an important tool for the development of precision agriculture strategies, in particular for accurate prescription maps for site specific weed management (SSWM) at early grow stages, These stages require to discriminate small plants (crop and weeds) that can not be detected using other remote platforms with coarse spatial resolution.

40|$|Overall, the <b>crop</b> <b>lines</b> are a {{reflection}} of the creviced pattern of the underlying karst bedrock and associated karst aquifer, and reveal the degree and extent of karstification in eastern Jo Daviess County. The <b>crop</b> <b>lines</b> were consistent with the angular lines of adjacent streams that show a rectangular drainage pattern. Stream patterns like these are well known and are due to drainage controlled by crevice/fracture patterns in the top of bedrock. The lines appear to have been formed by two sets of fractures trending roughly north-south and east-west with occasional cross-cutting fractures/ crevices. The east-west trending lines are consistent with tension joints, and the north-south lines are consistent with the shear joints identified by earlier researchers. The trends of the <b>crop</b> <b>lines,</b> tension and shear joints {{are similar to those of}} lineaments identified from LiDAR elevation data in the same area (N 20 ° W, and N 70 ° W and N 70 ° E) and coincide with the occurrence of karst features throughout eastern Jo Daviess County.

40|$|AGROSUPSPEEAGESTADIn {{the present}} agroecological context, the {{reduction}} of herbicide uses becomes a substantial issue. For weed control and site specific weed management {{the development of new}} technologies is required to identify individual plant. Although many crop/weed discrimination methods have been developed, the automatic intra-row weed detection is still a challenge, particularly in wheat. An imaging system is developed to detect black grass in wheat at early growing stage. The technique mimics the method used by a human expert in such conditions. Thus, the hypocotyl diameter was used as distinguishing criterion. For experiments, the seeds of black grass and wheat were sown in rectangular pots. Two planting protocols were carried out to reproduce the emergence difference of species as observed in actual field conditions: 1) black grass and wheat were planted in the <b>crop</b> <b>line</b> at the same time; 2) black grass were planted in the <b>crop</b> <b>line</b> seven days after wheat. The imaging system consisted in a multispectral camera placed at 1. 20 m above the pot soil surface. The view axis was tilted at 45 ° so that the side view of the crop row was captured in the image. Approximately 100 images were acquired at various times from plant emergence (BBCH-stage 11) to three leaf stage (BBCH-stage 13) of the wheat plant. The first step of image processing consisted in computing a color vegetation index (Excess Green Index) and thresholding the pixel values to provide a binary image of the plants without soil background. In the second step, various segmentation and filtering techniques were assessed to detect automatically the base of plant stems. Depending on the stem width, each plant was finally classified into wheat or black grass. Results are analyzed and discussed looking at the potential of this method regarding not only the plant species but also experimental conditions...|$|R

Despite the fact that its yields have doubled over the last three decades (FAOSTAT 2013) a constant need exists for new rice cultivars to be developed (Zhang 2007) be that through conventional breeding practises or genetic engineering platforms. While Agrobacterium mediated transformation (AMT) is widely adopted as the system of choice for engineering novel crop varieties freedom-to-operate issues remain (Chi-Ham et al. 2012), especially in regard to regional-specific licensing (e.g. in the USA due to US Patent No. 8273954). The cost of securing regulatory approval for AMT-derived lines is also significant primarily due to the plant pathogenic nature of A. tumefaciens (CropLife International 2011), which in turn ensures that bringing engineered <b>crop</b> <b>lines</b> through to commercialisation is typically an option exclusive to the largest ag-biotech companies.|$|E

A gizzard with gizzard plates probably originated in herbivorous taxa {{in which it}} worked like a grinding mill, thus might be secondarily reduced in carnivorous groups within Cephalaspidea s.s. and Gymnosomata. Klussmann-Kolb and Dinapoli considered the gizzard in Umbraculoidea as non-homologous with {{the one in the}} previous groups, on account of the absence of gizzard plates or spines. This contradicted Salvini-Plawen and Steiner, who had proposed the gizzard to be a synapomorphy of the larger clade of Paratectibranchia (Pteropoda, Cephalaspidea and Anaspidea) and Eleutherobranchia, secondarily lost in Nudipleura but still present in Umbraculoidea. As coded in Wägele and Klussmann-Kolb, phylogenetic hypothesis by Jörger et al.

Thus, the structure is proposed as a synapomorphy of Euopisthobranchia.|$|R

The proposed expert system exploits the human knowledge which is mapped into two modules based on image processing techniques. The first one is intended for separating green plants (crops and weeds) from the rest (soil, stones and others). The second one is based on the system geometry where the expected <b>crop</b> <b>lines</b> are mapped onto the image and then a correction is applied through the well-tested and robust Theil–Sen estimator in order to adjust them to the real ones.

40|$|Agricultural {{production}} is under increasing pressure by global anthropogenic changes, including rising population, diversion of cereals to biofuels, increased protein demands and climatic extremes. Because {{of the immediate}} and dynamic nature of these changes, adaptation measures are urgently needed to ensure both the stability and continued increase of the global food supply. Although potential adaption options often consider regional or sectoral variations of existing risk management (e. g. earlier planting dates, choice of crop), {{there may be a}} global-centric strategy for increasing productivity. In spite of the recognition that atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) is an essential plant resource that has increased globally by approximately 25 per cent since 1959, efforts to increase the biological conversion of atmospheric CO 2 to stimulate seed yield through crop selection is not generally recognized as an effective adaptation measure. In this review, we challenge that viewpoint through an assessment of existing studies on CO 2 and intraspecific variability to illustrate the potential biological basis for differential plant response among <b>crop</b> <b>lines</b> and demonstrate that while technical hurdles remain, active selection and breeding for CO 2 responsiveness among cereal varieties may provide one of the simplest and direct strategies for increasing global yields and maintaining food security with anthropogenic change...|$|E

Research activities have aided the development of protocols for these ‘forced’ crops, but {{little attention has been}} given to knowledge of how such protocols affect subsequent garden performance. The aim of this study therefore, was to investigate the influence of different production factors (cutting size, temperature, photoperiod and time of propagation) on flower induction both with respect to the main marketing stage, but also in terms of ‘after-sales’ performance. The short-lived herbaceous perennial Coreopsis grandiflora cv. Flying Saucers was used as a model subject. When exposed to five diurnal temperatures (14, 20, 24, 27 and 31 °C) and grown at four photoperiods (8, 11, 14 and 17 h), time to first open flower was optimal at 27 °C (42 days). Speed of flowering was aided by longer photoperiod (approximately 5 days earlier at 17 h than at 14 h). Greatest numbers of flowers produced overall though was associated with the 14 °C/ 14 h regime. Comparisons based on original cutting size demonstrated that large cuttings, rooted under long-day photoperiods produced plants with greater flower numbers than other cutting treatments. Once planted out, however, plants from all treatment combinations had similar floral performance (mean of 160 flowers per plant). Time of propagation/planting-out also had no overall effect on the numbers of flowers produced within the lifespan of the plant.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{interpretation}} of the eastern half portion of the <b>CROP</b> 11 <b>line,</b> a deep reflection seismic profile 265 km long that cuts across the central Apennines from the Tyrrhenian coast to the Adriatic coast. In the study area the line cuts across a pile of thrust sheets that underwent tectonic transport between the Messinian and the Pleistocene. In its easternmost part, the line runs through the Plio-Pleistocene deposits of the Adriatic foredeep. In the foreland region the <b>CROP</b> 11 <b>line</b> integrates previous information on the crustal structure derived from petroleum exploration and from deep seismic sounding refraction experiments. In particular, the <b>CROP</b> 11 <b>line</b> confirms the existence of a very thick sedimentary sequence underlying the Mesozoic-Tertiary carbonates of the Apulia Platform interpreted as the Paleozoic-Triassic sedimentary cover of a pre-Cambrian crystalline basement. In the mountain chain,where the base thrust of the orogenicwedge reaches a depth of about 25 km, this sedimentary sequence appears to be the deepest geological unit incorporated in the thrust system. This interpretation of the CROP 11 profile suggests an unusual thin-skin tectonic style implying the detachment from the original basement and the incorporation in the post-Tortonian tectonic wedge of a very thick Paleozoic-Triassic sedimentary sequence possibly affected by low-grade metamorphism in the lower part. Other new suggestions from the CROP 11 seismic data concern the origin of the Fucino basin, {{one of the most remarkable}} Plio-Pleistocene intramontane basins. The normal faults bordering this structural depression, as other important normal faults present in the central Apennines (e. g., the Caramanico fault system in the Majella region), seem to have been controlled by gravitational-collapse processes driven by uplift during crustal shortening rather than by a generalized extension subsequent to the Apennine compression, as usually reported in the geological literature. If this interpretation is correct, the strong seismic activity in correspondence to the Apennine watershed may be related to the very recent increase in the structural relief caused by an outof- sequence propagation of the active thrusts...|$|R
