40|$|Abstract: The {{properties}} of plain fiber assembly are discussed, and the fiber alignment {{in the assembly}} is investigated. Some theories in yarn irregularity research are applied {{to the study of}} the random and parallel fibers in fiber assembly and a stochastic method is used to generate the fiber assembly. For a given fiber length distribution, the combing process is simulated on the basis of the plain fiber assembly. If the main parameters in <b>cotton</b> <b>combing</b> are known, the simulation can be conducted, yielding the fiber length distributions in <b>combed</b> <b>cotton</b> slivers and in waste <b>cotton</b> that is <b>combed</b> down. With the variation of combing parameters, the influence of combing parameters on the combing results can be discussed from the simulation...|$|R

25|$|Combing {{straightens}} the fibres, isolates {{the long}} ones (tops) for spinning and discards the short ones (noil). There are {{various types of}} <b>combing</b> <b>machines</b> here, including the French comb, the Lister comb and the Holden comb.

50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of automatic machinery, there was little difficulty in attaining a straight fibre, as long wool was always used, and the sliver was made up by hand, using combs. The introduction of Richard Arkwright's water frame in 1771, and the later introduction of cap and mule spinning machines, required perfectly prepared slivers. Many manufactories used one or more preparatory <b>combing</b> <b>machines</b> (called gill-boxes) before worsting, to ensure straight fibres and to distribute the lubricant evenly.|$|R

40|$|Cotton {{knitted fabrics}} were {{manufactured}} with different yarn types (conventional ring spun yarn and torque-free ring spun yarn) with different fibre types (<b>combed</b> <b>cotton</b> and <b>combed</b> Supima <b>cotton)</b> and yarn fineness (Ne 30 and Ne 40). These fabrics were then dyed with {{three types of}} dye (reactive, direct and sulphur dye) with three dye concentrations (0. 1 %, 1. 0 % and 5. 0 % on-weight of fabric (owf)) in three colours (red, yellow and blue). This study examined the impact of constructional parameters and dyeing on ultraviolet (UV) protection properties of cotton knitted fabric. In-vitro test with spectrophotometer was used for evaluating the UV protection property of dyed cotton knitted fabrics. Among the six parameters investigated, fineness of yarn and dye concentration were the most significant factors affecting UPF while the color effect is the least significant. Experimental results revealed that the UPF value of dyed fabrics made from <b>combed</b> <b>cotton</b> is generally higher than the <b>combed</b> Supima <b>cotton</b> since <b>combed</b> <b>cotton</b> is composed of shorter fibres which facilitate the blocking or absorption of UV radiation. Second, fabrics made with twist yarn (i. e. ring spun yarn) have higher UPF value than the corresponding ESTex one (i. e. Torque-free yarn) in general since fabrics made with ring spun yarn tend to shrink during wet processing {{and so it is}} more compact. Third, the UPF value of fabrics made with 30 Ne yarn was higher than the 40 Ne one since it is thicker and has lower fabric porosity. Fourth, fabrics dyed with lower concentration of dye gave the lowest UPF. Fifth, the sulphur dyed samples performed worse than the reactive and direct dyed samples in terms of UV protection property. Sixth, there is no significant difference in UPF for red, yellow and blue coloured fabrics. Seventh, this study also demonstrated that lightness of fabric is negatively related to UV protection property. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
25|$|The combed slivers {{produced}} on {{any type of}} <b>combing</b> <b>machine</b> are passed through {{a process known as}} finishing. This process takes place in a series of gill boxes in which the fibres are redistributed, the slivers made uniform in thickness and moisture added in order to give the wool its natural suppleness and condition. Blending is done where necessary to keep the top up to a given standard of quality and, if dyed, consistency of colour. The top ball produced is suitable for packing for transport and unwinding. The top represents the wool comber's finished product, and it is in this form that the wool is bought and sold as the spinner's raw material.|$|R
30|$|According to Adanur (2001), the open-end is {{a process}} notably {{employed}} to produce denim yarn. The open-end yarns are cheap and rustic for not passing through machines that add a sophisticated finishing, such as textile laminating and <b>combing</b> <b>machines,</b> differing, for example, from the ring spinning process where a set of parallelized fibers is well twisted so there is high cohesion and strength. Additionally, in open-end spinning, the individual fibers are not uniformly arranged in the produced yarn as in the spinning ring produced yarn. In an open-end spinning yarn most of the fibers are parallel, but with some intersections and some irregular fibers surrounding the main cable (Fabriclink â€“ Fabric University 2012).|$|R

5000|$|In the 1940s {{after the}} {{imperative}} of wartime production had passed, Michell set about modernising the company's operations. State-of-the-art British <b>combing</b> <b>machines</b> were imported, utilising both the traditional Noble type {{and the more}} efficient French type. This enabled {{an increase in the}} overall output of wool tops by 30%, as well as the utilisation of shorter-fibered wool varieties, which previously had been sent overseas for processing. The quality of tops was also improved by this method, producing wool suitable for the manufacture of fine clothing. [...] In 1947, Michell pioneered an incentive wage scheme at the company's Hindmarsh and Fremantle processing facilities, whereby the typical worker could earn an average of 27% above the award wage for production beyond standard output levels.|$|R

50|$|Elmore {{seems to}} have been {{associated}} with The Clique, a group of young artists who saw themselves as followers of Hogarth and David Wilkie. According to his friend William Powell Frith he was member of the group, but since it was most active while he was in continental Europe, his involvement was probably short-lived. Most of Elmore's later works were historical narrative paintings. Religious Controversy and The Novice were implicitly anti-Catholic in character. Other paintings set episodes from Shakespeare, or the history of the French Revolution. They often contained subtle explorations of the process of creation, most importantly his two paintings about technological innovation, The Invention of the Stocking Loom (1847, Nottingham Castle Museum) and The Invention of the <b>Combing</b> <b>Machine</b> (1862, Cartwright Hall, Bradford). Both portray the process of industrialisation by depicting picturesque pre-industrial handicrafts.

25|$|Preparing is {{the process}} used in place of carding for long wools and hairs which would break on the card and {{therefore}} greatly reduce {{the quality of the}} worsted yarn produced. The maker-up or double-screw sheeting preparer is the first machine. This passes the fibre to and from delivery sheets via rollers, and ends with a lap of wool from six to eight feet long. The single screw can preparer is the most important machine of these, as it is here that the laps of wool or hair taken from the preceding boxes are prepared into a continuous sliver. The lap is placed on the feed sheet and carried forward to the back rollers. From the back rollers the fibres are delivered to the fallers, which with the aid of the front rollers, draw out the material into a continuous sliver. From the front rollers the sliver of fibres passes through a funnel, through the calender rollers and into a can which is placed directly underneath them. The material is now ready for the <b>combing</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R

2500|$|At {{the time}} of its closure in April 1981, Coldharbour Mill still had its textile {{machinery}} in position. The majority of these machines have been preserved (though not all are exhibited), and have been augmented with weaving machines rescued from the closure of the Tonedale site. The lowest part of the site, the level 1 combing shed, dealt with the initial cleaning and combing of the unwashed wool. The process involved a number of separate stages, each with a specialised machine. The eight opening gill machines (made by Taylor Wadsworth & Co)opened up the fleeces and prepared the wool for washing in a large back-washer with steam heated rollers. Following the washing, further gill boxes produced successively combed fibres, which were passed to a circular Noble <b>combing</b> <b>machine.</b> [...] This machine separated the fibres into long [...] "Tops" [...] and the short poor quality fibres. Although these machines are preserved on site, they are no longer in use today. British wool tops are purchased in, dyed into standard colours, and then up to ten strands of tops are fed into the Intersecting Gill Box (manufactured by Prince Smith and Stells in 1959). [...] The gill box starts the process of drawing out the fibres, and also enables new colours to be created by blending together the standard colours. The output of the gill box is termed a sliver. This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant.|$|R
