The overall level of traffic of all vehicle types entering the central Congestion Charge Zone was consistently 16% lower in 2006 than the pre-charge levels in 2002. Year on year, counts of inbound traffic approaching the zone had also seen a distinct and significant 5–7% decline in the number of chargeable vehicles, which was unexplained. They had noted a small but pervasive long term trend of less traffic entering the zone, expected to be a result of people changing their location and lifestyle, perhaps influenced by the charge. The conservative Bow Group noted that the main effect occurred after 11am.|$|E

40|$|For a doped antiferromagnet with {{short-range}} spin stripe correlations and long-range charge stripe order we {{find that}} the manifestation of charge order changes abruptly as a function of momentum along the Fermi surface. The disorder averaged local density of states is almost perfectly homogeneous when integrated only over states which contribute to the ``nodal'' spectral weight whereas it displays long range charge stripe order when integrated only over states which contribute to the ``antinodal'' spectral weight. An effectively two dimensional nodal liquid can thus coexist with static charge stripes provided there is no static spin order. We also study commensurate spin and charge stripe ordered systems where the Fermi surface consists of a nodal hole pocket and an open ``stripe band'' section. Due to the stripe order the relation between hole density and size of a pocket will be reduced compared to a paramagnet by a factor of two for even <b>charge</b> <b>period</b> and four for odd <b>charge</b> <b>period</b> and we find an estimated upper limit on the area fraction of a hole pocket of 1. 6 % for <b>charge</b> <b>period</b> four and 4 % for <b>charge</b> <b>period</b> five.

50|$|Justice Alito {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court. The Court held that according to Title VII, discriminatory intent must occur during the 180-day <b>charging</b> <b>period.</b> Ledbetter did not claim that Goodyear acted with discriminatory intent in the <b>charging</b> <b>period</b> by issuing the checks, nor by denying her a raise in 1998. She argued that the discriminatory behavior occurred long before but still affected her during the 180-day <b>charging</b> <b>period.</b> Prior caselaw, the Court held, established that the actual intentional discrimination must occur within the <b>charging</b> <b>period.</b> The Court also stated that according to those prior cases, Ledbetter’s claim that each check is an act of discrimination is inconsistent with the statute, because {{there was no evidence of}} discriminatory intent in the issuing of the checks.

40|$|We report {{experiments}} on a Laughlin quasiparticle interferometer where {{the entire system}} is on the 1 / 3 primary fractional quantum Hall plateau. Electron-beam lithography is used to define an approximately circular 2 D electron island separated from the 2 D bulk by two wide constrictions. The interferometer consists of counterpropagating chiral edge channels coupled by quantum-coherent tunneling in the two constrictions, thus enclosing an island area. Interference fringes are observed as conductance oscillations, similar to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The flux and <b>charge</b> <b>periods</b> of the interferometer device are calibrated with electrons in the integer quantum Hall regime. In the fractional regime we observe magnetic flux and <b>charge</b> <b>periods</b> h/e and e/ 3, respectively, corresponding to creation of one quasielectron in the island.

40|$|Laughlin quasiparticles are the {{elementary}} excitations of a highly-correlated fractional quantum Hall electron fluid. They have fractional charge and obey fractional statistics. The quasiparticles can propagate quantum-coherently in chiral edge channels, and constructively or destructively interfere. Unlike electrons, the interference condition for Laughlin quasiparticles has a non-vanishing statistical contribution {{that can be}} observed experimentally. Two kinds of interferometer devices have been realized. In the primary-filling interferometer, the entire device has filling 1 / 3, and the e/ 3 edge channel quasiparticles encircle identical e/ 3 island quasiparticles. Here the flux period is h/e, same as for electrons, but the back-gate <b>charge</b> <b>period</b> is e/ 3. In the second kind of interferometer, a lower density edge channel at filling 1 / 3 forms around a higher density island at filling 2 / 5, so that e/ 3 edge quasiparticles encircle e/ 5 island quasiparticles. Here we observe superperiodic oscillations with 5 h/e flux and 2 e <b>charge</b> <b>periods,</b> both corresponding to excitation of ten island quasiparticles.
