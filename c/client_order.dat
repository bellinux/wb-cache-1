50|$|<b>Client</b> <b>order</b> handling: MiFID has {{requirements}} {{relating to}} the information {{that needs to be}} captured when accepting client orders, ensuring that a firm is acting in a client's best interests and as to how orders from different clients may be aggregated.|$|E
50|$|The terms {{originate}} from the era when stock market trades were executed via paper carried by hand between trading desks. The routine business of hand-carrying client orders between desks would normally proceed at a walking pace, but a broker could literally run {{in front of}} the walking traffic to reach the desk and execute his own personal account order immediately before a large <b>client</b> <b>order.</b> Likewise, a broker could tail behind the person carrying a large <b>client</b> <b>order</b> {{to be the first to}} execute immediately after. Such actions amount to a type of insider trading, since they involve non-public knowledge of upcoming trades, and the broker privately exploits this information by controlling the sequence of those trades to favor a personal position.|$|E

50|$|Recording is {{sometimes}} advised, as in recording business transactions {{carried out by}} telephone to provide a record. It {{is sometimes}} mandatory; from March 2009 Financial Services Authority rules required firms to record all telephone conversations and electronic communications relating to <b>client</b> <b>orders</b> and the conclusion of transactions in the equity, bond, and derivatives markets. In November 2011 this was extended to cover the recording of mobile phone conversations that related to <b>client</b> <b>orders</b> and transactions by regulated firms.|$|R

5000|$|The forebears of today's smart order routers {{appeared}} in the late 1980s: [...] "In an attempt to lock in the <b>client</b> <b>order</b> flow and free traders up from smaller trades, in order to handle the larger trades, many of the larger broker dealers began to offer a new service called Direct Order Turnaround or DOT. DOT boxes were the first electronic machines to provide the institutional buy-side with {{what we now call}} “direct sponsored access”, they, however, were not very smart yet (they could be directed to only one destination, the New York Stock Exchange)".|$|E
40|$|Hidden orders add an {{important}} dimension to traders' strategies. This paper investigates why traders hide their orders and how other traders {{respond to the}} detection of hidden depth, using Euronext data. Our findings suggest that traders use hidden quantity to manage exposure risk and to mitigate adverse selection costs. Market members {{are less likely to}} hide their limit orders. The paper also produces evidence that traders detect hidden depth and adapt their order placement strategy accordingly. When hidden depth is discovered {{on the opposite side of}} the market, order aggressiveness increases. When hidden depth is discovered on the same side of the market, principal orders are less aggressive while <b>client</b> <b>order</b> aggressiveness increases...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} functionality of Magenta Multi-Agent Logistics i-Scheduler Engine {{presented on}} AAMAS 2006 conferences and gives examples of its application in business domain. The i-Scheduler Engine {{was designed to}} be scalable without a risk of combinatorial explosion, in order to handle large transportation networks as a whole. The multi-agent architecture combined with semantic network allows for a very granular approach for every business entity of transportation network (<b>client,</b> <b>order,</b> cargo, truck, driver, etc) and balancing of their conflicting interests. The i-Scheduler considers individual constraints and, interestingly, specific preferences of customers, drivers, trucks, cargoes, etc. This results in a unique ability to combine inbound and outbound deliveries, different fleets or private networks, driving more value from finding effective backhauls and consolidations. The paper covers the history of development, architecture and current functionality of the engine and provides a set of case studies in different transportation networks which outline the most serious challenges Magenta overcame in each case.

40|$|In this paper, I analyse {{the conduct}} of {{business}} rules included in the Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFID) which has replaced the Investment Services Directive (ISD). These rules, in addition to being part of the regulation of investment intermediaries, operate as contractual standards in the relationships between intermediaries and their clients. While the need to harmonise similar rules is generally acknowledged, in the present paper I ask whether the Lamfalussy regulatory architecture, which governs securities lawmaking in the EU, has in some way improved regulation in this area. In section II, I examine the general aspects of the Lamfalussy process. In section III, I critically analyse the MiFID s provisions on conduct of business obligations, best execution of transactions and <b>client</b> <b>order</b> handling, taking into account the new regime of trade internalisation by investment intermediaries and the ensuing competition between these intermediaries and market operators. In sectionIV, I draw some general conclusions on the re-regulation made under the Lamfalussy regulatory structure and its limits. In this section, I make a few preliminary comments on the relevance of {{conduct of business rules}} to contract law, the ISD rules of conduct and the role of harmonisation. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the end of}} 2014 Stockholm city {{assigned}} the project “Stockholmshusen” to the three public housing companies Familjebostäder, Stockholmshem and Svenska bostäder. The purpose of the project is to build 3 500 - 5 000 apartments with reasonable rents during four years. In this project the time for developing local plans, from start to approval, {{is supposed to be}} shortened from 24 to 15 - 18 months with help from the municipal’s technical departments. The project was founded by the public housing companies because of the increasing housing shortage, high costs for construction and long processing time for developing local plans in Sweden. The main goal with this thesis is to examine the “Stockholmshusen” project and how the three companies will execute the assignment. The project is studied with the perspective and theory <b>Client</b> <b>order</b> decoupling point (CODP) in order to decide where in the project the CODP lies in the project. The result of this study is presented as a case study with empiricism gathered with a qualitative research method, based on a literature study and interviews with four representatives from the public housing companies. The housing companies will sign framework agreements with three to five construction companies in order to design and construct the houses. The houses will be combinations of the construction companies own building systems and the housing companies’ requirements. The houses will be variable in length, height and color. Three different types of houses will be created: lamellar, tower blocks and block houses. In the best case this will result in a catalogue of 15 varieties of houses, which the housing companies will choose from later on, in the upcoming building projects. To succeed with the project the housing companies together with the technical departments will have to develop new working methods. The initiative can however be a part of decreasing the shortage of housings and be a part of developing the construction industry. This project is an attempt to modernize and shorten the process of developing local plans and it could make it more profitable for the construction companies in Sweden to develop industrial construction methods.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the trading behaviour of {{investors in the}} equities market of the Singapore Exchange (SGX). One of the main aims is to better understand how the heterogeneity of market participants with their strategies {{may be linked to}} the properties of order book dynamics. The conclusions drawn from the three essays could potentially influence the decisions of regulators, exchange operators, and investors in securities markets. The first essay investigates <b>client</b> <b>order</b> execution strategies in terms of how they place orders across the limit order book. The results suggest that a multi-price trading strategy, where investors place a &# 147;network&# 148; of buy and sell limit orders simultaneously, is a viable strategy and might even be profitable enough for investors to persist with the strategy. It is also shown that institutional investors tend to place more aggressive orders than retail investors. The second essay {{examines the}} effects prior order transactions, limit order book attributes, and market variables have on order submission and cancellation choices. It is found that while order transactions have a positive same order type order-by-order serial correlation, when order flow is aggregated by time intervals, the correlation of the changes in aggregated order flow of the same order type between consecutive time intervals is negative even over short time periods of five seconds. The positive order-by-order serial correlation for orders of the same type is present regardless of whether the incoming transaction is by an institutional investor or a retail investor. The final essay studies how changes in the limit order book and market conditions affect the aggressiveness levels of orders after their submissions and thus influence order cancellations. Traders who place orders {{near the top of the}} order book actively monitor those orders and decisions to cancel orders are significantly affected by changes in order book conditions such as order depth, stock volatility, market volatility, price returns, and net trade imbalance. In managing and balancing non-execution risk and option-to-trade risk, the probability that traders cancel their orders also differs depending on whether their orders have moved further away, remain unchanged, or are nearer to the best same-side prices...|$|E

2500|$|Operations {{management}} textbooks usually cover demand forecasting, {{even though}} it is not strictly speaking an operations problem, because demand is related to some production systems variables. [...] For example, a classic approach in dimensioning safety stocks requires calculating standard deviation of forecast errors. Demand forecasting is also a critical part of push systems, since order releases have to be planned ahead of actual <b>clients</b> <b>orders.</b> Also any serious discussion of capacity planning involves adjusting company outputs with market demands.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The MiFID is {{regarded}} as the core of EU financial market regulation. One of its quintessential features is the best execution of <b>client</b> <b>orders.</b> Best execution is virtually impossible to define; it is rather the definition of a suitable process for best execution compliance. To identify an appropriate approach, we analyze MiFID’s requirements and develop a best execution process model with emphasis on minimal requirements to ensure MiFID compliance without real-time information. We also present an approach that extends the process model towards dynamic best execution...|$|R
