[URL] paper proposes {{the design}} of a {{general-purpose}} domain-independent knowledge model formalizing and managing the <b>circumstantial</b> <b>knowledge</b> involved in the human interaction process, i. e., a Situation Model. Its design is aimed to be embodied into a human-like interaction system, thus enriching the quality of the interaction by providing context-aware features to the interaction system. The proposal differs from similar work in that it is supported by the spatio-temporal databases technology. Additionally, since the proposed model requires to be fed with real knowledge obtained from each specific interaction domain, this paper also proposes an edition tool for acquiring and managing that <b>circumstantial</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The tool also supports the simulation over the model to check the correctness and completeness of the acquired knowledge. Finally, some scenario examples are provided in order to illustrate how the Situation Model works, and to gain perspective on its future possibilities of application in different systems where context-aware services can make a difference. This work has been be applied in aresearch project funded by the Spanish Ministry of Industry (CADOOH,TSI- 020302 - 2011 - 21). Publicad...|$|E
40|$|The {{contributions}} {{of a school}} and pupil to learning are isolated with a unique interpretation of the education production function. Variance in pre-test scores and study time is then discovered to constrain efficiency and equal opportunity within schools. This dispersion creates the potential for Pareto exchange between schools resulting in higher and more equal educational opportunity among pupils across several schools. Finally, a voucher policy empowers persons possessing the necessary <b>circumstantial</b> <b>knowledge</b> for recognizing these Pareto exchanges to execute them. ...|$|E

Evolutionary algorithms {{have been widely used}} to solve large and complex optimisation problems.

These CAs are applied on a biobjective uncapacitated facility location problem (BOUFLP), the biobjective version of the well-known uncapacitated facility location problem. To the best of our knowledge, only few articles have applied evolutionary multiobjective algorithms on the BOUFLP and none of those has focused on the impact of the evolutionary strategy on the algorithm performance.

40|$|Multiple {{inherent}} biases {{related to}} different citation practices (for e. g., self-citations, negative citations, wrong citations, multi-authorship-biased citations, honorary citations, circumstantial citations, discriminatory citations, selective and arbitrary citations, etc.) make citation-based bibliometrics strongly flawed and defective measures. A paper {{can be highly}} cited for a while (for e. g., under <b>circumstantial</b> or transitional <b>knowledge),</b> but years later it may appear that its findings, paradigms, or theories were untrue or invalid anymore. By contrast, a paper may remain shelved or overlooked for years or decades, but new studies or discoveries may actualize its subject at any moment. As citation-based metrics are transformed into "commercial activities," the "citation credit" should be considered on a commercial basis too, {{in the sense that}} "citation credit" should be shared out as a "citation dividend" by shareholders (coauthors) averagely or proportionally to their contributions but not fully appropriated by each of them. At equal numbers of citations, the greater number of authors, the lower "citation credit" should be and vice versa. Overlooking the presence of distorted and subjective citation practices makes many people and administrators "obsessed" with the number of citations to such an extent to run after "highly cited" authors and to create specialized citation databases for commercial purposes. Citation-based bibliometrics, however, are unreliable and unscientific measures; citation counts do not mean that a more cited work is of a higher quality or accuracy than a less cited work because citations do not measure the quality or accuracy. Citations do not mean that a highly cited author or journal is more commendable than a less cited author or journal. Citations are not more than countable numbers: no more, no less...|$|R
40|$|Under {{the general}} American rule utterances {{revealing}} {{present state of}} mind are admissible to prove the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s state of mind before, after, or at time of speaking. The orthodox reason for the rule is well stated by Wigmore 2 ̆ 2... the judicial doctrine has been {{that there is a}} fair necessity, for lack of better evidence, for resorting to a person 2 ̆ 7 s own contemporary statements of his mental or physical condition. It is, indeed, possible to obtain by <b>circumstantial</b> evidence... some <b>knowledge</b> of a human being 2 ̆ 7 s internal state..., but in directness, amount, and value, this source of evidence must usually be decidedly inferior to the person 2 ̆ 7 s own contemporary assertions of those condi-tions. 2 ̆ 2 To the suggestion that the person 2 ̆ 7 s own statements on the stand would satisfy the need for his testimonial evidence, Wigmore says: 2 ̆ 2 The answer is that statements of this sort on the stand, where there is ample opportunity for deliberate misrepresentation and small means of checking it by other evidence or testing it by cross-examination, are comparatively inferior to statements made at times when no inducement to misrepresentation existed, and the probability of trustworthiness was greater. 2 ̆ 2 It will be observed that in this view hearsay testimony as to state of mind is not only better than circumstantial evidence, but also better than direct testimonial evidence. Here the great safeguards of cross-examination and the oath are regarded as inadequate. The state-ments of the speaker at the time when reported by one who can be sworn and cross-examined are more valuable than the testimony of the person whose internal state is the subject of discussion...|$|R

In first place, a cognitive approach to NI is glanced as the framework for such knowledge management.

40|$|During 1941 - 1942 New Zealand {{expended}} {{vast amounts}} of capital and labour building in-depth defences against the perceived invasion threat from Japan that today is often regarded, especially by academic historians, as non-existent. This thesis looks closely at the background of such a Japanese threat and the subsequent realities. It examines {{the failures of the}} existing, indeed traditional political alliance with the British ‘family of nations’ and its associated myths against the Realpolitik of New Zealand’s enforced absorption into the new American power block. The origins of today’s opinions are teased out to examine their realities and the drivers of the New Zealand government’s actions at the time are reviewed. These actions along with the experience, perceptions and, above all, the <b>circumstantial</b> <b>knowledge</b> that formed the opinions drove the decisions to act are established. The conclusion of this thesis is the threat to New Zealand of being raided, isolated, even possibly invaded, was geopolitically and militarily real at the time.

30|$|During {{the risk}} {{appraisal}} stage, {{the focus of}} discussions and debate is on the contribution of knowledge or understanding about the limits of knowledge and about the risk(s) being evaluated. Depending upon the issue at hand, both technical experts (senior risk assessors, scientists, engineers, economists, and other specialists) and stakeholders (affected communities, industries, and governments) can offer valuable input into assessing risks and their related uncertainties, and possible approaches to evaluating their impacts on different targets. The experience of local communities possibly affected by a risk, or of engineers involved {{in the design of}} manufacturing processes and so on, can also provide important input. It is not the task of stakeholders at the appraisal stage to deal with questions relating to the tolerability of the risk or risk management options. These issues are part of the evaluation and management phases. The input into this phase is restricted to knowledge in a wider sense. It includes systematic knowledge provided by scientists and experts, experiential knowledge provided by those who have gained familiarity with the problem (for example, plant operators or consumers of specific products), and local and <b>circumstantial</b> <b>knowledge</b> that may come from a local community or special group (Renn 2010). The focus on knowledge has been described by the term “epistemic discourse” for this type of deliberation (Renn and Schweizer 2009).|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} VRLA battery behavioural prediction {{models for}} extracting reserve time, {{state of health}} (SOH) and reserve life knowledge. A model for simulating battery discharge behaviour is also described. The research is focussed primarily on the standby VRLA battery such as that commonly employed by the telecommunications industry. Two approaches {{have been developed for}} extracting reserve time knowledge. The first utilises a discharge voltage versus reserve charge characteristic. This characteristic robust against modest variations in operating conditions and is reasonably robust against deterioration in battery SOH. To cater for different battery types an adaptive approach has been developed which also allows more accurate reserve time estimations for batteries with deteriorated SOH. It has been determined that reserve charge and therefore reserve time can be estimated to an accuracy of within ± 10 % after approximately 10 % into a discharge. The second approach utilises a unified characteristic, which enables the direct estimation of reserve time. It has the advantage over the approach based on the voltage versus reserve charge characteristic that it is not battery type specific. It is also more tolerant to changes in battery SOH. This comes at the disadvantage of greater initial estimation error, although the error reduces significantly throughout the discharge. This approach is less capable of dealing with stepped discharge rates or the discharging of partially charged batteries compared to the model based on the voltage versus SOC characteristic. Both approaches {{can also be used to}} obtain estimates of capacity, the primary battery SOH indicator. In addition battery SOH knowledge can be obtained from the coup de fouet region. This region is influenced by battery operating conditions as well as battery SOH. Various techniques for extracting SOH knowledge from the coup de fouet region are described. By incorporating the coup de fouet SOH estimation approach with the previous approaches, along with <b>circumstantial</b> <b>knowledge</b> obtained by monitoring (voltage, current and temperature) base parameters, reserve operational life can be estimated, The combination of approaches also enables the construction of a battery discharge simulation model...|$|E
40|$|Software Engineering (SE) is a {{knowledge}} intensive activity. It {{is also a}} social process where individuals {{interact with each other}} in an organisational setting to achieve desired outcomes. The objective of this research is to explore the nature of the knowledge needed to conduct software development and the influence knowledge has on software development performance. A survey of literature identifies that published works have attempted to examine the questions of knowledge and skill requirements to perform various roles in SE. However, this literature review reveals that while the need for some knowledge types is understood very well, other types have not been given adequate consideration. Further, {{it is important to understand}} knowledge and performance requirements based on solid foundational theories developed in fields such as cognitive psychology. Cognitive theories on knowledge and action model how knowledge is stored, accessed and used in the human mind. On the other hand, the social origin theories of knowledge and expertise emphasise the importance of contextual or <b>circumstantial</b> <b>knowledge</b> to action. This research applies a reconciled model between these schools of thought to SE. Based on this model, both predominantly contextual and non-contextual cognitive knowledge are required to perform various roles in SE. A theoretical framework is developed that identifies nine types of knowledge required for an individual to perform SE roles. These knowledge types are 1) configuration knowledge (functional and technical knowledge about application systems), 2) social network knowledge, 3) process and procedural knowledge, 4) systems knowledge, 5) business domain are{{a knowledge}}, 6) soft skills, 7) technique skills, 8) cultural and 9) heuristics knowledge. Using this framework, the research explores more broadly the knowledge required to perform various SE roles and examines the contribution that additional knowledge makes to perceived SE team performance improvement. The theoretical framework has been tested using two research studies - first, using a case study of individuals in a software project setting and, secondly, using a survey of SE professionals to collect and analyse the knowledge requirements to perform their job. The analysis of survey data revealed a new classification schema of knowledge types for performing various SE roles. These are: Factor 1 : Knowledge of organisational culture and relationships Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSA) (Including organisational culture and organisational relationships) Factor 2 : Project software development KSA (Including technical skills, knowledge of application software items in the organisation and processes used in the SE team) Factor 3 : Management skills (Including negotiation, management and organisational skills) Factor 4 : Heuristic knowledge (including standards, guidelines, shortcuts and rules of thumb) Factor 5 : Communication and team work skills Factor 6 : Business functional KSA (Including business domain area knowledge, user interfaces, business analysis and testing) Factor 7 : Problem solving abilities (Working with others in the team, the ability to investigate, analyse, propose and solve problems and issues) The results empirically demonstrate the nature of both contextual and non-contextual cognitive knowledge types that are required to perform various SE roles. The research identified the knowledge types that are significantly required in various phases of Software Development Life Cycle. It is found that technique skills and configuration knowledge contribute most to improvements in performance after an individual joins a SE team. This research formulated, tested and found empirical support to theory of knowledge and performance that is based on both contextual and non-contextual knowledge types. By arriving at the knowledge classification and relationships this research has contributed to the theoretical knowledge base. The results of this study are significant to SE practice as they assist organisations in formulating knowledge management (KM) strategies. By implementing these KM strategies success rates can be improved, failures reduced and productivity enhanced. Further, the identified knowledge types are important to academia for better curriculum design on SE...|$|E
40|$|The current {{processes}} {{involved in}} the acquisition of investigative data from third parties, such as banks, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and employers, by the public authorities can breach {{the rights of the}} individuals under investigation. This is mainly caused by the necessity to identify the records of interest, and thus the potential suspects, to the dataholders. Conversely, the public authorities often put pressure on legislators to provide a more direct access to the third party data, mainly in order to improve on turnaround times for enquiries and to limit the likelihood of compromising the investigations. This thesis presents a novel methodology for improving privacy and the performance of the investigative data acquisition process. The thesis shows {{that it is possible to}} adapt Symmetric Private Information Retrieval (SPIR) protocols for use in the acquisition process, and that it is possible to dynamically adjust the balance between the privacy and performance based on the notion of k-anonymity. In order to evaluate the findings an Investigative Data Acquisition Platform (IDAP) is formalised, as a cryptographic privacy-preserving enhancement to the current data acquisition process. SPIR protocols are often computationally intensive, and therefore, they are generally unsuitable to retrieve records from large datasets, such as the ISP databases containing records of the network traffic data. This thesis shows that, despite the fact that many potential sources of investigative data exist, in most cases the data acquisition process can be treated as a single-database SPIR. Thanks to this observation, the notion of k-anonymity, developed for privacy-preserving statistical data-mining protocols, can be applied to the investigative scenarios, and used to narrow down the number of records that need to be processed by a SPIR protocol. This novel approach makes the application of SPIR protocols in the retrieval of investigative data feasible. The dilution factor is defined, by this thesis, as a parameter that expresses the range of records used to hide a single identity of a suspect. Interestingly, the value of this parameter does not need to be large in order to protect privacy, if the enquiries to a given dataholder are frequent. Therefore, IDAP is capable of retrieving an interesting record from a dataholder in a matter of seconds, while an ordinary SPIR protocol could take days to complete retrieval of a record from a large dataset. This thesis introduces into the investigative scenario a semi-trusted third party, which is a watchdog organisation that could proxy the requests for investigative data from all public authorities. This party verifies the requests for data and hides the requesting party from the dataholder. This limits the dataholders ability to judge the nature of the enquiry. Moreover, the semi-trusted party would filter the SPIR responses from the dataholders, by securely discarding the records unrelated to enquiries. This would prevent the requesting party from using a large computational power to decrypt the diluting records in the future, and would allow the watchdog organisation to verify retrieved data in court, if such a need arises. Therefore, this thesis demonstrates a new use for the semi-trusted third parties in SPIR protocols. Traditionally used to improve on the complexity of SPIR protocols, such party can potentially improve the perception of the cryptographic trapdoor-based privacy- preserving information retrieval systems, by introducing policy-based controls. The final contribution to knowledge of this thesis is definition of the process of privacy-preserving matching records from different datasets based on multiple selection criteria. This allows for the retrieval of records based on parameters other than the identifier of the interesting record. Thus, it is capable of adding a degree of fuzzy matching to the SPIR protocols that traditionally require a perfect match of the request to the records being retrieved. This allows for searching datasets based on <b>circumstantial</b> <b>knowledge</b> and suspect profiles, thus, extends the notion of SPIR to more complex scenarios. The constructed IDAP is thus a platform for investigative data acquisition employing the Private Equi-join (PE) protocol – a commutative cryptography SPIR protocol. The thesis shows that the use of commutative cryptography in enquiries where multiple records need to be matched and then retrieved (m-out-of-n enquiries) is beneficial to the computational performance. However, the above customisations can be applied to other SPIR protocols in order to make them suitable for the investigative data acquisition process. These customisations, together with the findings of the literature review and the analysis of the field presented in this thesis, contribute to knowledge and can improve privacy in the investigative enquiries.
