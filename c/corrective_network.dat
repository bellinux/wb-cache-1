The {{rapid growth in}} size and complexity of distributed networks {{and the use of}} heterogeneous components require effective tools to manage these resources. The system management aspect of distributed networks is one of the least mature components of the environment, and unfortunately it is receiving little attention by systems developers for various reasons. A new model of an expert network system network manager has been designed based on an analysis and evaluation of major contemporary distributed network management systems: (i) DEC PolyCenter network management system, (ii) Hewlett-Packard Open View network management system, (iii) IDM NetView network management system, and (iv) Sun Microsystems SunNet network management system. These network management systems can handle network operations, administration, maintenance and provisioning functions with human intervention, but they cannot handle or predict unforeseen network fault situations; autonomous capabilities are entirely missing. A model of an expert network management system that utilizes a rule-based paradigm for decision making and neural networks for fault-recognition and -prediction has been proposed. The design includes all the functionalities recommended by International Standard Organization (ISO) for Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. The proposed model also possesses existing operational features of contemporary distributed network management systems, and is capable of providing <b>corrective</b> <b>network</b> maintenance actions manually as well as automatically. A prototype was built and tested to authenticate the new model. Test results indicate that the combination of a rule-based paradigm with neural network fault-recognition and -prediction capabilities can be useful in the design of successful future distributed network management systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the recent}} PSpice programs, five types of the GaAs FET model have been implemented. However, {{some of them}} are too {{sophisticated}} and therefore difficult to measure and identify afterwards, especially the realistic model of Parker and Skellern. In the paper, simple enhancements of one of the classical models are proposed first. The resulting modification is usable for reliable modeling of both GaAs FETs and pHEMTs. Moreover, its adjusted capacitance function can effectively serve as a convenient representation of microwave varactors. The accuracy of these models can be strongly enhanced using the artificial neural networks – both using an exclusive neural network without an analytic model and co-operating a <b>corrective</b> neural <b>network</b> with the updated analytic model are discussed. The accuracy of the updated analytic models, the models based on the exclusive neural network, and the models created as a combination of the updated analytic model and the <b>corrective</b> neural <b>network</b> is compared.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the welding parameters for pipeline welding {{is based on a}} skilled welder’s know-how and long-term experiences rather than on theoretical and analytical techniques. In this paper, an intelligent system for the {{determination of}} welding parameters for each pass and welding position, for pipeline welding based on one database and a finite element method (FEM) model, and on two back-propagation (BP) neural network models and a <b>corrective</b> neural <b>network</b> (CNN) model was developed and validated. The preliminary test of the system has indicated that the system could determine the welding parameters for pipeline welding quickly, from which good weldments can be produced without experienced welding personnel. Experiments using the predicted welding parameters from the developed system proved the feasibility of interface standards and intelligent control technology to increase productivity, improve quality and reduce the cost of system integration...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Consensus {{algorithms}} {{can be used}} {{to compute}} an average value across a multi-hop network in a distributed way. However, their convergence to the right value is not guaranteed in the presence of random packet losses that are common in real life low-power wireless <b>networks.</b> <b>Corrective</b> consensus solves this problem by using a set of auxiliary variables to compensate for the asymmetric state updates caused by packet losses. Nevertheless, one key assumption is that the probability of delivering a packet from node i to a neighboring node j is the same as in the reverse direction, from j to i. This assumption might be violated in real life conditions. Our main contribution is showing that corrective consensus converges to the correct average even when this assumption is removed. In addition, we provide a heuristic for modifying the weights used by corrective consensus that specifically considers the unequal probabilities, and we empirically show that this choice can lead to faster convergence.
