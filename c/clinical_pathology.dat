25|$|Surgical {{pathology}} is {{the most}} significant and time-consuming area of practice for most anatomical pathologists. Surgical pathology involves the gross and microscopic examination of surgical specimens, as well as biopsies submitted by non-surgeons such as general internists, medical subspecialists, dermatologists, and interventional radiologists. Surgical pathology increasingly requires technologies and skills traditionally associated with <b>clinical</b> <b>pathology</b> such as molecular diagnostics.|$|E
25|$|Anatomic {{pathology}} {{relates to}} the processing, examination, and diagnosis of surgical specimens by a physician trained in pathological diagnosis. <b>Clinical</b> <b>pathology</b> is the division that processes the test requests more familiar to the general public; such as blood cell counts, coagulation studies, urinalysis, blood glucose level determinations and throat cultures.

25|$|Group {{practice}} {{is the most}} traditional private practice model. In this arrangement, a group of senior pathologists will control a partnership that employs junior pathologists and contracts independently with hospitals to provide diagnostic services, as well as attracting referral business from local clinicians who practice in the outpatient setting. The group often owns a laboratory for histology and ancillary testing of tissue, and may hold contracts to run hospital-owned labs. Many pathologists who practice in this setting are trained and certified in both anatomical pathology and <b>clinical</b> <b>pathology,</b> which allows them to supervise blood banks, clinical chemistry laboratories, and medical microbiology laboratories as well.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to improve the match between graduate training and employer requirements when relevant organizations interact with university faculty and manage to obtain money for laboratories and equipment. The competence of medical laboratory technicians was improved in five Ethiopian universities. In-service training was too disruptive to normal services which already suffered from staff shortages. The Centre for Disease Control Ethiopia and the American Society for <b>Clinical</b> <b>Pathology</b> (ASCP) together with university faculty assessed medical laboratory education. The curriculum was revised and standardized to include practical training which formed part of the final assessment. Faculty staff were trained in grant writing and quality management systems. The United States President's fund for AIDS relief provided money for equipment, including an uninterrupted power supply and consumables. Lecturers were trained {{to use the new}} curriculum, improve their teaching skills and up-date their knowledge through website resources supplied by ASCP consultants.

40|$|Due to the {{conflicting}} results regarding {{the association between}} breast cancerand the GSTM 1 null mutation, {{our aim was to}} research this associationin a Brazilian population and correlations withsmoking, reproductive history and several <b>clinical</b> <b>pathologies.</b> A case-control study was performed on 105 women with breast cancer and 278 controls. Extraction of DNA was accomplished according to the protocol of the GFX® kit and polymorphism analysis by the PCR technique. The control and experimental groups were compared and statistical analysis assessed by X² or Fisher's exact test. The deletion in the GSTM 1 gene in the breast cancer group had a prevalence of 32 (30. 4 %) individuals with the presence of null mutation. In the control group, the null mutation was present in 104 (37. 4 %) women. Upon comparison of the two groups, no statistically significant difference of the GSTM 1 gene was observed, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0. 74, 95 %, confidence interval (CI) 0. 45 - 1. 20, p = 0. 277. The results conclusively show that singlegene GSTM 1 polymorphisms do not confer a substantial risk of breastcancer to its carriers. Furthermore, in this study no correlation was found between GSTs andsmoking, reproductive history and several <b>clinical</b> <b>pathologies</b> with respect to cancer risk...|$|R

25|$|Lederberg {{was born}} in Montclair, New Jersey, to a Jewish family, son of Esther Goldenbaum Schulman Lederberg and Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Lederberg, in 1925, and moved to Washington Heights, Manhattan as an infant. He had two younger brothers. Lederberg {{graduated}} from Stuyvesant High School in New York City {{at the age of}} 15 in 1941. After graduation, he was allowed lab space as part of the American Institute Science Laboratory, a forerunner of the Westinghouse Science Talent Search. He enrolled in Columbia University in 1941, majoring in zoology. Under the mentorship of Francis J. Ryan, he conducted biochemical and genetic studies on the bread mold Neurospora crassa. Intending to receive his MD and fulfill his military service obligations, Lederberg worked as a hospital corpsman during 1943 in the <b>clinical</b> <b>pathology</b> laboratory at St. Albans Naval Hospital, where he examined sailors' blood and stool samples for malaria. He went on to receive his undergraduate degree in 1944.|$|E
25|$|Immunopathology is {{a branch}} of <b>clinical</b> <b>pathology</b> that deals with an organism’s immune {{response}} to a certain disease. When a foreign antigen enters the body, there is either an antigen specific or nonspecific response to it. These responses are the immune system fighting off the foreign antigens, whether they are deadly or not. Immunopathology could refer to how the foreign antigens cause the immune system to have a response or problems that can arise from an organism’s own immune response on itself. There are certain problems or faults in the immune system {{that can lead to}} more serious illness or disease. These diseases can come from one of the following problems. The first would be Hypersensitivity reactions, where there would be a stronger immune response than normal. There are four different types (type one, two, three and four), all with varying types and degrees of an immune response. The problems that arise from each type vary from small allergic reactions to more serious illnesses such as tuberculosis or arthritis. The second kind of complication in the immune system is Autoimmunity, where the immune system would attack itself rather than the antigen. Inflammation {{is a prime example of}} autoimmunity, as the immune cells used are self-reactive. A few examples of autoimmune diseases are Type 1 diabetes, Addison’s disease and Celiac disease. The third and final type of complication with the immune system is Immunodeficiency, where the immune system lacks the ability to fight off a certain disease. The immune system’s ability to combat it is either hindered or completely absent. The two types are Primary Immunodeficiency, where the immune system is either missing a key component or does not function properly, and Secondary Immunodeficiency, where disease is obtained from an outside source, like radiation or heat, and therefore cannot function properly. Diseases that can cause immunodeficiency include HIV, AIDS and leukemia. In all vertebrates, there are two different kinds of immune responses: Innate and Adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is used to fight off non-changing antigens and is therefore considered nonspecific. It is usually a more immediate response than the adaptive immune system, usually responding within minutes to hours. It is composed of physical blockades such as the skin, but also contains nonspecific immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, T Cells, and basophils. The second for of immunity is Adaptive immunity. This form of immunity requires recognition of the foreign antigen before a response is produced. Once the antigen is recognized, a specific response is produced in order to destroy the specific antigen. Because of this idea, adaptive immunity is considered to be specific immunity. A key part of adaptive immunity that separates it from innate is the use of memory to combat the antigen in the future. When the antigen is originally introduced, the organism does not have any receptors for the antigen so it must generate them from the first time the antigen is present. The immune system then builds a memory of that antigen, which enables it to recognize the antigen quicker in the future and be able to combat it quicker and more efficiently. The more the system is exposed to the antigen, the quicker it will build up its responsiveness.|$|E

Golgi observed that all parasites {{present in the}} blood divided almost simultaneously at regular intervals and that division coincided with attacks of fever. In 1886 Golgi described the morphological differences that are still used to distinguish two malaria parasite species Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium malariae. Shortly after this Sakharov in 1889 and Marchiafava & Celli in 1890 independently identified Plasmodium falciparum as a species distinct from P. vivax and P. malariae. In 1890, Grassi and Feletti reviewed the available information and named both P. malariae and P. vivax (although within the genus Haemamoeba.) By 1890, Laveran's germ was generally accepted, but most of his initial ideas had been discarded {{in favor of the}} taxonomic work and <b>clinical</b> <b>pathology</b> of the Italian school. Marchiafava and Celli called the new microorganism Plasmodium. H. vivax was soon renamed Plasmodium vivax. In 1892, Marchiafava and Bignami proved that the multiple forms seen by Laveran were from a single species. This species was eventually named P. falciparum. Laveran was awarded the 1907 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine [...] "in recognition of his work on the role played by protozoa in causing diseases".|$|E
