5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{seeds and}} stems are edible {{and are used}} in {{traditional}} Native American cuisine by Alaska Natives, Inuit and Inupiat people. The leaves and roots of E.angustifolium are also edible and, because of their astringent properties, used by the Yupik peoples for medicinal purposes, {{through a process of}} decoction, infusion or poultice, to treat aliments of the human gastrointestinal tract, and in the Old World for the treatment of diarrhoea. In abundance, E.angustifolium can grow with enough density to disguise wetland and bog. Consequently, it may be used as a natural indicator of areas which are hazardous and to avoid travelling through. Attempts to make a cotton-like thread from the hairs of the plant's seed-heads have been thwarted by its brittleness, but it has been used in the production of paper and <b>candle</b> <b>wicks</b> in Germany, and was used as a feather substitute in pillow stuffing in Sweden and Sussex, England.

50|$|A <b>candle</b> <b>wick</b> is a {{piece of}} string or cord that holds the flame of a candle. Commercial wicks are made from braided cotton. The wick's {{capillarity}} determines {{the rate at which the}} melted hydrocarbon is conveyed to the flame. If the capillarity is too great, the molten wax streams down the side of the candle. Wicks are often infused with a variety of chemicals to modify their burning characteristics. For example, it is usually desirable that the wick not glow after the flame is extinguished. Typical agents are ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate.|$|E

50|$|The Argand lamp, {{invented in}} 1782 by the Swiss scientist, Aimé Argand, {{revolutionized}} lighthouse illumination with its steady smokeless flame. The Argand lamp had a sleeve-shaped <b>candle</b> <b>wick</b> mounted so that air could pass both {{through the center}} of the wick and also around the outside of the wick before being drawn into cylindrical chimney. This steadied the flame and improved the flow of air. Early models used ground glass which was sometimes tinted around the wick. Later models used a mantle of thorium dioxide suspended over the flame, creating a bright, steady light. The Argand lamp used whale oil, colza, olive oil or other vegetable oil as fuel which was supplied by a gravity feed from a reservoir mounted above the burner. The lamp was first produced by Matthew Boulton, in partnership with Argand, in 1784 and became the standard for lighthouses for over a century.|$|E

40|$|The Committee is {{requested}} {{to assess the}} potential human health risks from exposure to lead when candles containing lead candle-wicks are burned during normal use.
