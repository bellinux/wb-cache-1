25|$|The bottom wing was rigged with 3° {{dihedral}} {{while the}} top wing lacked any dihedral; {{this meant that}} the gap between the wings was less at the tips than at the roots; this change had been made at the suggestion of Fred Sigrist, the Sopwith works manager, as a measure to simplify the aircraft's construction.

25|$|On some of {{the busiest}} routes, the {{convenience}} of the low floor is lost because of the anomalies caused by the hesitant upgrade of tram to metro. The city has four heavy metro lines and three stretches of premetro or underground tram. The premetro tunnels have been built to allow for eventual upgrade to heavy metro, {{so most of the}} platform is high, and is connected to the street (at least in the upward direction) by escalator. At some stations lifts have been installed, but there is a <b>cutout</b> <b>section</b> taking the level down to one foot above ground to board the trams. The three steps this entails make life difficult for passengers with baby buggies or suitcases, even though the new low-floor trams are accessible to wheel-chair users. To get around this last barrier to mobility, an experimental ramp was installed in 2009 at Parvis de St-Gilles/St-Gillis Voorplein.|$|E

30|$|To select {{suitable}} cutout {{location in}} existing R.C. slabs, {{the moment of}} resistance should be considered for slab at <b>cutout’s</b> <b>section.</b> The position of the cutout with CFRP strengthening doesn’t provide significant change in load capacity, and finally slabs strengthened with CFRP sheets along the cutout edges give results higher than CFRP sheets at the cutout’s corners with 45 ° only.|$|R

50|$|In 1896 Mauser {{changed the}} firing pin {{distance}} facilitating faster lock time and accuracy; he also installed a <b>cutout</b> <b>section</b> in {{the left of the}} receiver, perfect for a thumb to fill while loading the ammunition from a charger/stripper clip. More impressively, he improved the bolt again by: 1), creating vector holes for gas from a ruptured primer; 2), a shrouded bolt head that protected the shooter from a ruptured cartridge; 3), the bolt head was designed to divert gas away {{from the face of the}} shooter; 4), a third bolt lug was added to keep the shooter safe if the two main bolt lugs should fail; and finally 5), a better designed extractor was added.|$|E

5000|$|The artwork for Blackstar was {{designed}} by Jonathan Barnbrook, who had designed the artwork for Bowie's Heathen, Reality and The Next Day. The star image on the cover is credited to NASA in the CD booklet. The five star segments below the main star form the word BOWIE in stylised letters. The vinyl cover, in black, features the star as a <b>cutout</b> <b>section,</b> revealing the record (with an all-black picture label) beneath it. With the record removed, the black paper behind the cut-out star reveals a hidden picture of a starfield when the foldout sleeve is held up to a light source. It took more than four months before fans first discovered the effect. The designer claimed there were many other surprises hidden in the LP's artwork.Music journalists also noted that a [...] "black star lesion," [...] usually found inside a breast, suggests to medical practitioners evidence of certain types of cancer.|$|E
40|$|CIVINSSeveral shell {{deformation}} models are developed {{for use in}} crashworthiness analysis of rotationally symmetric structures. These models use analytical techniques to predict the crushing force versus axial crush distance characteristics of both a rigid-plastic, hemispherical shell and an elastic, cylindrical shell loaded axially by a rigid flat plate. Additional methods are proposed {{to determine the effects}} of <b>cutout</b> <b>sections</b> and internal stiffening members on the crushing force capacity of the shells. These proposed methods are applied to determine the energy absorption capability of the composite/metal nose structure of a mini submarine subjected to a head-on impact with a flat rigid wall. The nose structure is composed of a stiffened composite shell that covers and is attached to the metal, forward, hemispherical portion of the pressure hull. The complex structure is simplified to a rotationally symmetric shell model and modified to account for the effects of stiffening elements and <b>cutout</b> <b>sections.</b> Laminated plate theory, a progressive composite failure method, and the models developed are then used to determine the structure's energy absorption capacity. The fairing structure is determined to be capable of absorbing the kinetic energy associated with an impact from an initial vehicle speed of 7. 5 knots. Further, the entire nose structure (the fairing and forward pressure hull) is predicted to be able to absorb the kinetic energy from a 26. 4 knot vehicle impact[URL]...|$|R

2500|$|Since {{the engine}} inside the locomotive's hood didn't {{take up the}} full carbody width, it seemed only logical that the hood could be [...] "cut away" [...] a bit, leaning towards what was then more {{typically}} switch engine practice, to allow the crew to see the train more easily from inside the cab, and also to ride more safely outside the cab, but while hopefully retaining the style and looks of a full width carbody type. Thus, they created an early [...] "road switcher", which combined the power and speed of a mainline [...] "road" [...] engine with the visibility and convenience of a switch engine, and which have since become ubiquitous on North American railroads. This wasn't an entirely new idea, as the Pennsylvania Railroad's GG1 fleet, which featured large <b>cutout</b> <b>sections</b> in its hoods, had been in service since 1934 (although without external riding platforms). Both the BL and GG series attempted to preserve the stylish appearance of a carbody unit, to make them suitable for passenger duty, but subsequent road switchers have adopted a purely utilitarian appearance, and are most often used for freight service.|$|R
