40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} compliance with the requirements of passive transparency in <b>city</b> <b>councils</b> of Brazilian municipalities with populations greater than 300, 000 inhabitants. The research is descriptive, operationalized by a survey with predominantly qualitative approach. The data collected from 79 <b>city</b> <b>councils</b> were analyzed using the descriptive analysis technique. Three groups were identified in the <b>city</b> <b>councils</b> analyzed: first, <b>city</b> <b>councils</b> to which it was not possible to submit the request for information; second, <b>city</b> <b>councils</b> to which the request for information was submitted, but there was no reply or the response was insufficient; and third, <b>city</b> <b>councils</b> to which the request for information was submitted and there was satisfactory response. The scenario shows little passive transparency before the technological apparatus was available. There are <b>city</b> <b>councils</b> that violate a series of legal provisions regulating the transparency of government actions. The study stands out for diagnosing the current situation of passive transparency in the <b>city</b> <b>councils</b> of the largest Brazilian municipalities, revealing how the law, in general, can be violated, and not taken seriously...|$|R

Despite Britannia's guarantee at the inquiry to proceed with the development it reconsidered its plans. In a letter to English Heritage, Britannia said the proposed scheme was unsustainable for the foreseeable future. Britannia wanted to return to the rejected tower plan.

The first <b>city</b> <b>council,</b> mainly composed of wealthy merchants and industrialists, quickly looked to improve the harbour, situated along the Aarhus River. Larger ships and growing freight volumes made a river harbour increasingly impractical. In 1840, the harbour was moved to the coast, north of the river where it became the largest industrial harbour outside Copenhagen over the following 15 years. From the outset, the new harbour was controlled by the <b>city</b> <b>council,</b> as it is to this day.|$|E
