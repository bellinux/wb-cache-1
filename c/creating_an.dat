50|$|There {{is no one}} defined way to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> vexel, however, one archetypal way to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> vexel follows. Instead {{of using}} vector-based lines, shapes, and polygons to <b>create</b> <b>an</b> image, a vexel is {{typically}} <b>created</b> using <b>a</b> raster program's support for transparent layers. Each transparent layer is given a solid (or sometimes gradient) shape and a display ordering that when displayed together with other near shape layers appears to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> stepped-but-gradual color transition.

5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, <b>creating</b> <b>an</b> oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, <b>creating</b> <b>an</b> oil which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E
