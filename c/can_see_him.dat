He appears briefly in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, when Harry asks him {{to bring him to}} the Grey Lady.|$|E
500|$|We {{must live}} with our {{virtually}} complete ignorance of Padarn’s life. It {{is fair to}} say, however, {{that if he had}} died at Llanbadarn {{there would have been a}} shrine, traditions of which would have survived for centuries; none are recorded. Therefore, we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> as one of the more peripatetic of the missionaries of this period, who spent sufficient time in the Rheidol valley to attract a community of Christian men to him which was sufficiently strong to survive his departure. It could have been these followers in subsequent generations who would have established churches in the saint's name in mid-Wales (Llanbadarn Fynydd, Llanbadarn Garreg), and in Ceredigion (Llanbadarn Odwyn, Llanbadarn Trefeglwys [...] ), if he didn't establish them himself.|$|E
500|$|Kafka {{worked out}} for the Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots, and Oakland Raiders prior to the draft. Mike Mayock called Kafka the [...] "sleeper" [...] of the quarterback class, {{projecting}} him to be drafted in the sixth round. Mayock also said, [...] "He's a really smart kid. Has a better arm than people think. I don't even think he's sleeping anymore. He was a month-and-a-half ago, but he's on the rise. He's a kid who could surprise people {{at the end of}} the day." [...] Former NFL quarterback Ron Jaworski concurred, saying that Kafka [...] "knows how to play the quarterback position. There's a real feel for hitting the open receiver, good anticipation. I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> being one of those sleeper type guys." [...] A scout before the draft said that Kafka [...] "throws a lot of picks, but at least he's willing to pull the trigger. You don't see that from a lot of young kids." ...|$|E

He declared, [...] "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm {{going to let you}} finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time." [...] West was profusely criticized from celebrities and fans alike over the incident. Following the interruption, the status of Fame Kills was rumored to be in question. A representative from an US urban radio station commented: [...] "I think this could potentially affect his upcoming tour with Lady Gaga. This isn't an urban tour— urban audiences can be a bit more forgiving than mainstream audiences are. I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> going on stage and people booing him. It's unfortunate." [...] Less than a week after the ticket sales began, the tour was canceled but no reason was given.|$|E
500|$|In 1927, Treatt {{was given}} the {{position}} of Challis lecturer in criminal law at the University of Sydney, a position he was to hold until 1959. One of his students was the future Justice of the High Court of Australia, Michael Kirby: [...] "I can still see Mr Vernon Treatt QC coming on to {{the stage of the}} Phillip Street Theatre where we took some of our lectures. Treatt's task was to instruct a hundred first year law students in that most important discipline, criminal law. I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> toss his hat onto the chair, open his notes and begin reading his latest lesson. I can hear him talking about the sections of the Crimes Act 1900 of New South Wales dealing with 'unnatural offences'. I can recall his rasping voice as he intoned the old provisions of section 79, spitting out the exceptionally ugly words of denunciation in the parliamentary prose". In March 1928, Treatt was appointed and served as a Crown Prosecutor for the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Court of Quarter sessions for the metropolitan district.|$|E

He resided for a time with a couple in Eeklo who had taken him in after earlier rows with his wife, before moving-on to stay with other friends. His parents, who run a bar and his supporters' club in Ploegsteert - membership dropped from 300 to 145 between 2005 and 2006 although 600 bought [...] "Franky is for ever" [...] T-shirts - said in 2006 that they had heard little from their son since he left Belgium for Italy. His wife had visited twice, to present her husband's new clothing collection, but not to see Vandenbroucke. In 2005, he and his estranged wife and their daughter had a weekend at Eurodisney in Paris. Supporters in the Frankyboys fan club at the café 't Parkske in Oudenaarde said Vandenbroucke {{had never been to}} see them, [...] "although he said a couple of times that he would come but then never did." [...] The chairman of the Frankyboys, Adelin de Meulemeester, said: [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> one day and he'll give you a friendly hello, then the next he won't even notice you [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|Spider-Man's costume in {{the film}} has more {{technical}} improvements than previous suits, including the logo on the chest being a remote drone, an AI system similar to Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S., a holographic interface, a parachute, a tracking device for Stark to track Parker, a heater, an airbag, the ability to light up, {{and the ability to}} augment reality with the eye pieces. Stark also builds in a [...] "training wheels" [...] protocol, to initially limit Parker's access to all of its features. Carroll noted Marvel went through the comics and [...] "pull out all the sort of fun and wacky things the suit did" [...] to include in the Homecoming suit. Spider-Man's web shooters have various settings, first teased at the end of Civil War, which Carroll explained, [...] "he can adjust the spray, and he can even scroll through different web settings, like spinning web, web ball, ricochet web… you know, all of the stuff we <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> do in the comics... It’s kind of like a DSLR camera. He can shoot without it, or he can hold that thing a second, get his aiming right, and really choose a web to shoot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Timberlake has co-owned or {{provided}} celebrity endorsement {{for three}} {{restaurants in the}} United States: [...] "Chi" [...] opened in West Hollywood, California in 2003, and [...] "Destino" [...] and [...] "Southern Hospitalty" [...] in New York opened in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2005, Timberlake launched the William Rast clothing line with childhood friend Juan ("Trace") Ayala. The 2007 line contained cord jackets, cashmere sweaters, jeans, and polo shirts. The pair reports inspiration from fellow Memphis native Elvis Presley: [...] "Elvis is the perfect mixture of Justin and I," [...] Ayala says. [...] "You {{can go back and}} see pictures of him in cowboy boots and a cowboy hat and a nice button-down shirt, but then again you <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in a tux and a collared shirt with rhinestones on it and slacks. We like to think 'If he was alive today, what would he be wearing?'" [...] Target has announced that a William Rast collection, including denim, outerwear and sportswear for men and women, would launch in December and be available for a month. In 2015, the clothing line earned him a Lord & Taylor's Fashion Oracle Award at the Fashion Group International's Night of The Stars Gala. An avid amateur golfer, in 2007 Timberlake purchased the run-down Big Creek Golf Course in his home town of Millington, Tennessee, which he redeveloped as the eco-friendly Mirimichi Golf Course at a cost of some $US16 million. It was reopened on July 25, 2009 but closed again on January 15, 2010 for further improvements expected to take six months. In October 2011, Timberlake received the Futures Award at the Environmental Media Awards for his green-conscious golf course. It was reported on November 7, 2014, that Timberlake had sold Mirimichi to Three Star Leasing LLC for $500,000. Timberlake and his wife Jessica Biel are minority owners of the Memphis Grizzlies.|$|E
