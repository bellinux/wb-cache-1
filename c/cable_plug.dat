50|$|One of {{the major}} trends is making {{everything}} wireless. Most systems have <b>cables</b> <b>plugged</b> {{in the front and}} back. While there are not many <b>cables</b> <b>plugged</b> into the system, if the system is close to the television system and audio system, then the cables might be quite extensive and very haphazardly arranged. By making most of the accessories wireless the goal is {{to cut down on the}} clutter. One of the problems with wireless accessories is power. There is currently no wireless power source for the accessory. So in most cases batteries of some fashion are required. A problem with this can be the power requirements of the regular function of the accessory as well as the components used to maintain the wireless connection. Often the power draw on these batteries can be too much for it to be cost effective to power these devices without rechargeable batteries. A solution to this is a rechargeable controller station.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Digital {{design and}} {{assembly}} of cables {{is a most}} important and difficult problem in mechanical industry. The paper solved the problem through the CAD/CAE software. Firstly, 3 -D model of electrical bundle {{was built in the}} digital mock-up. The model reflected the parameters of the bundle exactly. After the design of cables, the simulation of cable moving was developed. The flexible feature of cable was displayed in the animation. It was an exciting achievement of this article, which can be used in the virtual assembly of cables to detect design problems. Besides the maintenance process containing <b>cable</b> <b>plug</b> and pull was simulated. The ergonomics was then tested in the form of virtual maintenance...|$|E

40|$|As a {{narrative}} pattern and a cultural motif, the confusion between fictional worlds and reality traditionally leads to metaphysical arguments about liberty and destiny. Despite their drawing heavily on scientific imagination and technoscientific artefacts, science fiction movies exploring that theme never really broke {{with the way}} it has been treated since Calderon de la Barca’s Life is a dream: the hero’s quest leads him to doubt his own identity and dispute the ontological status of the world he lives in, leaving him and the viewer perplexed as to the ultimate nature of things. Yet, in the last fifteen years, an increasing number of science-fiction movies renewed that interrogation, notably by placing the issue of design at the centre of the plot: fictional worlds are not only denounced as fictional, but also shown as works in progress, literally rebuilt according to the plan of not-so-hidden designers acting as demiurges. In Dark City, Vanilla Sky or, more recently, Inception and The Adjustment Bureau, the emphasis on design and architecture together with the use of computational metaphors result in the promotion of one particular world to the status of “reference” universe, to be held as more “real” than other, fabricated and computed worlds made accessible by sophisticated devices operating as metaleptic instruments (such as Neo’s <b>cable</b> <b>plug</b> or the “bio-ports” in ExistenZ). This paper wishes to explore this shift towards “gnostic", Matrix-like science-fictional narratives, particularly in relation to the dramatic development of networking and surveillance capabilities that occurred during the same period...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on characterising small waste {{electric}} and electronic equipment, specifically small household appliances, from two different points of views: disassembly properties and material identification. The sample for this characterisation was obtained from a selective collection campaign organised in Castellón de la Plana (Spain). A total amount of 833. 7 kg (749 units) of small waste electric and electronic equipment was collected, of which 23. 3 % by weight and 22. 4 % by units belonged to the subcategory household equipment. This subcategory, composed of appliances such as vacuum cleaners, toasters, sandwich makers, hand blenders, juicers, coffee makers, hairdryers, scales, irons and heaters, was first disassembled in order to analyse {{different aspects of the}} disassembly process for each equipment type: type of joints, ease of identification of materials, ease of access to joints for extracting components, ease of separation of components from the whole, uniformity of tools needed for the disassembly process and possibility of reassembly after disassembly. Results show that the most common joints used in these equipment types are snap-fits and screws, although some permanent joints have also been identified. Next, the material composition of each component of each appliance belonging to each equipment type was identified visually and with additional mechanical trials and testing. It can be observed that plastic and electric/electronic components are present in all the equipment types analysed and are also the material fractions that appear with higher percentages in the material composition: 41. 1 wt% and 39. 1 wt% for the plastic fraction and electric/electronic components, respectively. The most common plastics are: polypropylene (PP), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polycarbonate (PC), while the most common electric/electronic components are: <b>cable,</b> <b>plug</b> and printed circuit boards. Results also show that disassembly properties and material characterisation vary widely from one equipment type to another. The authors wish to thank all the schools and families who collaborated during the campaign for the selective collection of domestic small waste electrical and electronic equipment, and the company Reciplana Recuperacions S. L. for their assistance during the stages of transportation and final treatment of the sample after its characterisation.

40|$|The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a {{worldwide}} standard for communication between peripherals. Nowadays USB interfaces are integrated {{in almost every}} device. It {{will be used to}} connect peripherals and computers. USB devices communicate between pieces of hardware, i. e., <b>cable,</b> <b>plug</b> and socket. Thus, there exists different standardized communication protocols depending on the application. In case of different communication protocols, it is necessary to verify them, that devices, no matter of country, can communicate to each other. The verifying process is very important in order that companies can sell products with such interfaces and their designated logo, to guaranty a certain standard, which is provided all over the world. Devices have to complete various test procedures to get certified. Otherwise a company is not allowed to use logos ore designations, i. e., USB or information about data rates, i. e., SuperSpeed. Furthermore, successfully completed test procedures prove that a device works properly based on a professional method. The Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) device family from the company Marquardt Verwaltungs GmbH, is using the USB interface for service and data exchange purposes. The service application is realized through a Virtual COM Port (VCP), based on the Communication Device Class (CDC) of USB. On the other side they want to use the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) based on the Still Image Capture Device class for data exchange between the HMI device and a computer. Of course, the integrated circuit, which implements the USB interface on the circuit board of the HMI device has to be verified, too. The verification will be performed through an external company. In contrast, the communication protocols do not need a verification but must be examined. The identification of an USB class in an operating system does neither guaranty a proper functionality nor comply with a professional scientific method. To accelerate the development of a project as well as to reduce the production costs, it is a significant advantage to own a test environment. Microsoft provides the possibility to verify devices on Windows operating systems. Therefor they invented the Windows Certification Program, which contains software {{that can be used for}} verification purposes. One of them is the Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK) we want to set up and set the HMI device under test, to examine the implementation of MTP. Thus, it is possible to use the HCK test setup during a development process to examine a current implementation without a big effort, i. e., cooperation with an external company or similarly approaches, which delays the whole development process by far. ...|$|E
