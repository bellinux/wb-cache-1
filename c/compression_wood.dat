In kraft pulping knots are typically 0.5 - 3.0 % of the digester throughput. The knots are screened from the pulp, because if left in the pulp they may damage washing equipment and consume large amounts of bleaching chemicals. They are normally sent back to the digester and re-cooked so that their fibres are not wasted.|$|E

40|$|This thesis gives {{a summary}} and {{discussion}} of results from five studies concerned with: the distribution of <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> in relation to external stem and log geometry {{and the impact of}} the <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> distribution on deformations of sawn timber. Moreover the straightening process of trees is discussed. In order to study the distribution of <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> in stems and logs, 63 trees of Norway spruce and Scots pine representing different age and curvature categories were sliced into 621 discs. In order to study the impact of <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> on deformations of sawn timber, 146 logs of Scots pine and Norway spruce were processed into studs and battens. Before crosscutting, the external geometry of stems and logs were assessed. A 3 D-logscanner was used for the assessment of logs. Deformations such as bow, spring and twist were measured on studs and battens at green condition, at 18 % moisture content and at 12 % moisture content. <b>Compression</b> <b>wood</b> content in thin cross sections of discs, studs and battens were analysed using transmitted light and image analysis. The analyses showed that a majority of all discs and cross sections contained <b>compression</b> <b>wood.</b> In all studies, the pith eccentricity was significantly correlated to the discs´ <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> content. For the 6 -year-old Scots pine trees, the <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> content was significantly correlated to the size of basal sweep but not to out-of-roundness. For the 22 -year-old Scots pine trees, the <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> content was not correlated to either bow height or size of basal sweep. For the 60 -year-old Norway spruce trees, the <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> content was significantly correlated to <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> content in log ends, pith eccentricity and bow height. For sawn timber, the <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> content and its position was significantly correlated to bow and spring but not twist. Twist was significantly correlated to grain angle measured on tangential faces of studs and spiral grain angle measured under bark on the surface of logs. Results indicate that eccentric growth and <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> formation play major roles in the development of stem straightness. Moreover, young trees with basal sweep will be straighter over time. Consequently, the straightness of a log is not a reliable measure of the <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> content within the stem. By combining data describing external geometry with information regarding <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> content and pith eccentricity obtained from log ends it is possible to detect logs that are prone to contain <b>compression</b> <b>wood.</b> The results also indicate that the distribution of <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> in sawn timber influences the direction and size of bow and spring...|$|E
30|$|Compressions in tangential, radial and 45 ° {{direction}} {{were very}} effective in MC reduction, suggesting that the pre-treatment by <b>compression</b> for <b>wood</b> drying is {{very effective in}} round wood {{and all kinds of}} timbers, including flat grain timber, vertical grain timber and the in-between vertical and flat grain timber. Of all the compression directions, the tangential compression showed a maximum MC reduction.|$|R
30|$|The {{previous}} report [1] {{showed that the}} moisture content (MC) could be very effectively reduced by means of pre-treatment by <b>compression</b> for <b>wood</b> drying. Unavoidable factors, including compression ratio, compression direction and compression speed, were systematically studied {{in terms of their}} effects on MC reduction. This study is obvious not enough because when talking about the <b>compression</b> of <b>wood,</b> the recovery rate (RR) is an unavoidable important factor affecting the volume of wood and therefore the value of wood. In addition, mechanical properties are among the most important properties in wood utilization, how the mechanical properties change after the treatment is one of top concerns. The effects of compression ratio, compression direction and compression speed on RR and mechanical properties are not clear. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to systematically study the effects of compression ratio, compression direction and compression speed on RR and mechanical properties, so that people will have a clear and enough information before practicing the pre-treatment technique in the wood industry.|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanical}} properties at all conditions showed a slight loss or increase {{compared with the}} controlled specimens, they retained at least 83.1 and 88.1  % of MOR, 84.9 and 83.7  % of MOE for Poplar and Chinese fir, respectively.

40|$|Inter-tracheid and cross-filed pit {{specifications}} in <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> {{and opposite}} wood of Norway spruce (Picea abies) were determined. Fewer pits of a smaller size {{and a smaller}} aperture diameter were observed in <b>compression</b> <b>wood.</b> In contrast to the uniseriate arrangement of bordered pit pairs in <b>compression</b> <b>wood,</b> both uniseriate and biseriate pits were observed in opposite wood. In contrast to the circular view of the pit aperture in opposite wood, a slit-like pit aperture was often observed in <b>compression</b> <b>wood.</b> SEM images showed a number of helical fissures on the tracheid walls and bordered pits of <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> along the microfibril angle in the S 2 layer. The cross-field pits in <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> were dominantly piceoid but sometimes cupressoid and occasionally taxodioid, whereas they were mostly piceoid and occasionally cupressoid in opposite wood. Overall, some {{significant differences in the}} inter-tracheid and cross-field pitting between the <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> and opposite wood can give some explanations for their different air permeability and drying kinetics found in the previous studies...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the conducted research work was to study the performance of compression and normal wood as a raw material for medium density fibreboards (MDF). For this purpose stems from Norway spruce (Picea abies [L. ] Karst.) with a high content of <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> were selected, separated in <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> and normal wood and finally chipped. Thermomechanical pulps (TMP) were prepared form both types of chips. Morphological, physical and chemical invenstigations were carried out on both wood samples {{as well as on}} TMP prepared therefrom. Moreover, medium density fibreboards (MDF) were made at pilot scale using a melamine modified urea formaldehyde resin (MUF-resin) as a binder. The results can be summarized as follows: Native <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> fibres showed lower average fibre length (15 %) compared to TMP from normal wood. Possibly due to the higher lignin content the water retention value (WRV-value) of TMP from <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> was lower (10 %) in comparison to normal wood fibres. Cold water extracts of TMP from normal and <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> showed the same pH-value, the buffering capacity of cold water extracts was more or less at the same level. Moreover, the formaldehyde release of TMP from <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> fibres was lower in comparison to normal wood fibres. Concerning the physical-mechanical properties of MDF the following results were found: MDF, prepared from <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> TMP, showed lower thickness swelling values (20 [...] . 30 %) compared to MDF from TMP of normal wood. Also the water absorption value from <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> MDF was at a relatively lower level. Moreover, MDF prepared from <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> TMP showed in comparison to MDF from normal wood TMP both a higher internal bond strength (> 35 %) als well as a higher surface hardness (Brinell-hardness) (25 %). The higher surface hardness {{may be due to the}} higher lignin content of <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> fibres. In contrast, the bending strength of <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> MDF was on a slightly lower level. This may be due to the shorter fibre length of <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> TMP...|$|E

Measurements of 72 sample trees in 2001 showed that 96 % of the trees had developed straight stem bases. External geometry data of the logs was obtained with a Rema 3 D log scanner.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out if changes in chemistry could be used to quantify Pinus radiata <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> severity or degree of <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> development. Basic chemical composition and the lignin structure was assessed for a range of different <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> samples sourced from juvenile wood, mature wood, earlywood, latewood, branches, knots, 2 -year and 1 -year old Pinus radiata. Fluorescence microscopy was used as the reference method to assess the degree of <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> development. Lignin structure of <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> was studied by thioacidolysis, size exclusion chromatography, and thioacidolysis/ 31 P NMR spectroscopy. Variation in the basic chemical composition and lignin structure with <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> severity was ascertained. Results showed that, as the severity of <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> changed, progressively from normal through mild to severe, all chemical parameters commonly associated with <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> changed concurrently. With increasing severity lignin and galactose levels increased while glucose and mannose levels decreased. Lignin structural changes were also associated with changing severity of <b>compression</b> <b>wood.</b> Levels of p-hydroxyphenyl (H) releasable β-ethers increased and guaiacyl (G) releasable β-ethers decreased. Similarly, levels of uncondensed p-hydroxyphenyl units increased, while uncondensed guaiacyl units decreased. Similar proportions of condensed guaiacyl units were present in <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> and normal wood. Similar trends in chemical composition were observed between the <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> and related opposite wood in branches, knots and young wood of Pinus radiata. A number of chemical parameters changed linearly with <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> severity. They were: the amount of lignin and galactose, the galactose/glucose ratio and p-hydroxyphenyl content in lignin. Parameters based on the p-hydroxyphenyl unit content in lignin, the H/G releasable β-ether ratio, releasable p-hydroxyphenyl β-ether units and uncondensed p-hydroxyphenyl C 9 units are most suitable indicators of <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> severity as they spanned a larger range relative to the normal wood levels and were not influenced by the morphological origin of wood samples. Chemical methods for quantifying <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> severity should focus on the detection and measurement of these parameters. Galactan present in Pinus radiata <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> was isolated and characterised. Structural investigation by methylation analysis and NMR spectroscopy revealed that this galactan was largely composed of (1 → 4) -linked β-D-galactopyranose residues. No evidence was found to indicate the presence of any branches. Characterisation of lignin in cell wall fractions of Pinus radiata normal wood revealed that middle lamella lignin has a higher lignin content, a lower amount of releasable β-ethers and a more condensed lignin than the secondary wall lignin. Levels of releasable p-hydroxyphenyl units were not higher in middle lamella lignin. A new method based on thioacidolysis and 31 P quantitative NMR spectroscopy for estimation of the degree of lignin condensation of the phenolic and etherified C 9 units in in situ wood lignin is described. Using this method it was found that phenolic C 9 units in in situ lignin were considerably less condensed than etherified C 9 units in both <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> and normal wood...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Xylem anatomy is {{a strong}} {{determinant}} of water transport efficiency and is therefore {{an important component of}} the overall hydraulic strategy of any woody plant. However, in addition to its role in water transport, xylem also serves in mechanical support, and these two functions may represent conflicting design requirements. To further our understanding of how mechanical requirements might affect water transport in woody plants, this research evaluates the efficiency with which <b>compression</b> <b>wood,</b> which is specialized to function in mechanical support, conducts water. Using young Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) trees, two modes of <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> formation are considered: normally-growing branches and branches that take over as leaders. Lower branch halves, which contained large amounts of <b>compression</b> <b>wood,</b> were significantly limited in their ability to conduct water relative to upper halves. This is likely a result of their anatomy, as lower halves were denser and had shorter tracheids with narrower cell lumens than upper halves. <b>Compression</b> <b>wood</b> samples from branches that had taken over as leaders were also limited in their ability to conduct water, relative to samples from the wood formed opposite and to the sides of <b>compression</b> <b>wood.</b> In addition, <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> samples from branches that had taken over as leaders were less permeable than lower branch halves. Despite the poor transport efficiency of lower branch halves, the amount of <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> visible on the end of each branch segment did not explain any significant variation in whole segment hydraulic properties. This lack of relationship between <b>compression</b> <b>wood</b> and whole segment properties suggests that branches may make up for the lost conductive capacity in some way. In branches that replaced a missing leader, there was no evidence that xylem formed elsewhere in the segment (i. e., "opposite wood") made up for the loss through a concomitant increase in permeability. Instead, branches that replaced leaders increased their transport efficiency relative to normal branches through an increase in conducting cross-sectional area. Given the reduced permeability of <b>compression</b> <b>wood,</b> future work should address how woody plants minimize or counteract the detrimental effects of this mechanically-specialized xylem to fulfill their water transport needs...|$|E
