2500|$|Gurlitt's family (cousins) also {{entered the}} discussion, raising {{questions}} about {{the legality of the}} will, based on his state of mind at the time. Gurlitt's cousin, Uta Werner, filed a <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> on the artwork. Werner's lawyer, Wolfgang Seybold, argued that Gurlitt's relatives were the righful heirs. Seybold supported his argument with the opinion of psychiatrist and lawyer Helmut Hausner, who stated that Gurlitt suffered from schizoid personality disorder, delusions, and dementia when he wrote the will bequeathing his collection to the museum. It is possible that a number of artworks will be returned to Gurlitt's estate, as he would have been considered the rightful owner unless the heirs of previous owners could prove that he obtained them through unlawful means. German authorities estimate that around 590 pieces need further investigation to determine whether they were confiscated under the Nazi regime, and a further 380 have been definitively identified as confiscated by the Nazis as [...] "degenerate art".|$|E

60|$|Will was startled. Whatever {{the words}} might be, the tone {{seemed like a}} dismissal; and quitting his leaning posture, he walked a little way towards her. Their eyes met, but with a strange {{questioning}} gravity. Something was keeping their minds aloof, and each was left to conjecture {{what was in the}} other. Will had really never thought of himself as having a <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> on the property which was held by Dorothea, and would have required a narrative to make him understand her present feeling.|$|E

50|$|During {{his time}} in England Lievens painted a {{portrait}} for Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, and became influenced by the works of Anthony van Dyck. Lievens worked in Antwerp, and cooperated with Adriaen Brouwer. After being a court painter in The Hague and Berlin, he returned to Amsterdam in 1655. After his first wife died he married a sister of Jan de Bray in 1648. After 1672, the Rampjaar Lievens had increasing financial difficulties and his family voided all <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> on his death due to his debts.|$|R
5000|$|The Queen, in {{consideration}} of the [...] "many eminent services performed to herself and to her royal predecessors by the honourable and noble House of Stanley", withdrew her right and referred the contending claimants to {{the decision of the}} Privy Council as to the best <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Family names {{derived from}} matronyms {{are found in}} France, {{especially}} in Normandy: Catherine, Marie, Jeanne, Adeline.

50|$|It is {{possible}} that his descendants and those of his male relatives - if they survive - represent a direct surviving branch of the House of Aberffraw and would therefore be claimants to the long dormant throne of Gwynedd. It would also make them rivals to the claims (now extinct) made by Sir John Wynn and the Lords of Gwydyr. However, under Welsh Law an illegitimate son must first be acknowledged by his father to have any <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance,</b> and of this there is no known record.|$|E

50|$|Henry V of England {{asserted}} a <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> {{through his}} mother, with female agency and inheritance recognized in English law but prohibited in France by the Salic Law of the Holy Roman Empire. He thus would succeed to {{the claim of}} his great-grandfather, Edward III of England, to the French throne. If Edward III's claim to the French throne was questionable, Henry V's claim was more so.needed Henry IV of England, his father, had obtained the throne despite claims by the heirs of Richard II of England, the House of March, heirs of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, second son of Edward III (this claim would later pass to the House of York). Henry V's claim to France represented the conflict between English and Holy Roman Empire law on the agency and inheritance of daughters.|$|E

40|$|In 1994 Harold Acton, son of Arthur Acton, an English {{art dealer}} in Florence, and Hortense Mitchell Acton, an American banking heiress, donated his family home, Villa La Pietra, to New York University. Today, this Tuscan villa {{is at the}} center of a {{declaration}} of paternity lawsuit and a <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> brought by Liana Beacci, Arthur Acton 2 ̆ 7 s daughter by his Italian secretary. In this Note, Felicia Caponigri presents the facts of the case, focusing on the provenance of the Villa, and the procedural posture of the case. Caponigri applies Italian law to argue that New York University might claim clear title to the Villa if Hortense 2 ̆ 7 s father gave her the Villa, or if Hortense set up a legal entity in which she placed title to Villa La Pietra. Caponigri also argues the Beacci might have a colorable claim if Hortense and Arthur Acton acquired the Villa together...|$|E

In July 2014, Garima returned to <b>claim</b> the right <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> for her son and grandson which she felt was endangered because, she claims, Ameeta had been selling the properties as well as transferring them into the charitable trust headed by her.|$|R
25|$|Welsh law {{was still}} used for civil {{cases such as}} land inheritance, contracts, sureties and similar matters, though with changes, for example illegitimate sons could no longer <b>claim</b> part <b>of</b> the <b>inheritance.</b> The Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 brought Wales entirely under English law; when the 1535 Act {{declares}} the intention utterly to extirpe alle and singular sinister usages and customs belonging to Wales, Welsh law was probably the main target.|$|R
5000|$|Two grandchildren <b>claimed</b> half <b>of</b> the <b>inheritance</b> [...] {{and sent}} Sir Edward Walker to the Netherlands. In 1655 Stafford {{was arrested in}} Utrecht, but {{released}} within a few weeks. Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk and his brother Charles were keen on getting the paintings and went in Utrecht to court in 1658 and 1661. Later on Henry inherited Arundel House, and Tart Hall (on Stafford Row) went to their uncle William.|$|R
50|$|The Statute of Rhuddlan {{divided the}} {{territory}} under royal control into six shire counties on the English model, administered by royal officials.

50|$|In the Ancien Régime, aubaine was a {{right of}} the King of France, {{allowing}} him to <b>claim</b> the <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> all foreigners in his dominions; exclusive of all other lords, and even of any testament the deceased could make.

50|$|Studies of Burgundofara's life, {{and those}} of noble heiresses in similar situations, lead some writers to {{conclude}} that in fact the abbey was very likely established with her father's blessing, and the supposed parental insistence upon her marriage may have been {{no more than a}} front, especially if the marriage was proposed by the King. An edict of King Chilperic I a generation earlier had favoured the <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> daughters in <b>inheritance</b> over those <b>of</b> uncles and nephews, making the marriage of an heiress of considerable importance to the wider family.|$|R
60|$|Well, he did {{not give}} it over yet, but came to the serious part, and there he thought he should be too many for me. He first hinted that {{marriage}} was decreed by Heaven; {{that it was the}} fixed state of life, which God had appointed for man's felicity, and for establishing a legal posterity; that there could be no legal <b>claim</b> <b>of</b> estates by <b>inheritance</b> but by children born in wedlock; that all the rest was sunk under scandal and illegitimacy; and very well he talked upon that subject indeed.|$|R
5000|$|The Statute of Rhuddlan {{introduced}} English {{common law}} to the principality, albeit with some local variation. Criminal law became entirely based on common law: the Statute stated that [...] "in thefts, larcenies, burnings, murders, manslaughters and manifest and notorious robberies — we will that they shall use {{the laws of}} England". However, Welsh law continued {{to be used in}} civil cases such as land inheritance, contracts, sureties and similar matters, though with changes, for example illegitimate sons could no longer <b>claim</b> part <b>of</b> the <b>inheritance,</b> which Welsh law had allowed them to do.|$|R
50|$|In 1443, Elisabeth {{was forced}} to give Brzeg to Dukes John I of Lüben and Henry X of Chojnów, sons of Louis III of Oława, {{who had died in}} 1441. Both {{brothers}} <b>claimed</b> the <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> Duke Louis II as his lawful male heirs and because Elisabeth retained both Duchies illegally. In order to make a bond with him, the Duchess gave her youngest daughter Hedwig in marriage to John I. The wedding took place in February 1445.|$|R
5000|$|There {{was much}} {{contention}} between the Catholic Lorraine {{and the newly}} Protestant Saarwerden. When Protestant Philip II inherited the lands in 1574, Duke Charles III of Lorraine demanded Saarwerden back as a completed fief (meaning Philip was without any heirs). The dispute went on {{for many years and}} threatened several times to escalate to military level. The Elector Palatine, Frederick III also <b>claimed</b> parts <b>of</b> the <b>inheritance.</b> Here too, the House of Nassau managed to prevail on the essential points. Several large treaties were closed, in which the exact rights and boundaries of the Nassau and Palatinate territories were defined.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1380s, Patrikas {{arrived to}} Novgorod to <b>claim</b> the <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> his father, Narimantas. He was ceded the fiefs of Korela, Oreshek, Koporye, Luga, and Ladoga. He held {{practically}} all the [...] "Votian land" [...] as a fief from the Novgorod Republic. The Novgorodians kept {{the lands of}} Patrikas {{as a sort of}} buffer state between their republic and Sweden (see Swedish-Novgorodian Wars). Patrikas helped fortify the northwestern borders of the trade republic and built the fortress of Yam in the Luga district.|$|R
50|$|On 25 February 1769 Claude Dupin died in Paris. He left {{a fortune}} {{estimated}} {{at more than}} two million gold francs. Louis-Claude Dupin denounces his father's will, dated 15 January 1768 and <b>claimed</b> half <b>of</b> the <b>inheritance.</b> Finally, after protacted negotiations, in 1772 was divided the result of the liquidation of the estate between Madame Dupin, Louis-Claude and Claude-Sophie Dupin (the only son of the late Jacques-Armand). Louise receives Chenonceau with all his furniture, the Marquisate of Blanc and the Hôtel de Vins, in Plâtrière street. On 18 September 1788, Claude-Sophie died in Chenonceau aged 38. With the disappearance of her grandson without issue, Madame Dupin has no direct descendants.|$|R
50|$|In 1127, he {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Count Renaud III of Burgundy, because both men <b>claimed</b> the <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> Conrad's murdered nephew William III. In this situation, he benefitted from the situation Emperor Lothar III found himself in. Lothar III urgently needed support against his Hohenstaufen rivals, and he supported Conrad's claim. He rejected Renaud's claim, with the dubious argument that Renaud had failed to comply with his duty to attend the Emperor's court. Conrad received the title Rector of Burgundy, which denoted, as least theoretically, a kind of representative of the Emperor in the Kingdom of Burgundy.|$|R
50|$|The Act {{primarily}} {{helps to}} determine the heirs {{of a person who}} has died intestate. For example, Alice and Bob are a married, retired couple with no offspring. They die in a plane crash, and it cannot be determined which person died first. Neither had executed a will, so both Alice's and Bob's families <b>claim</b> <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> the couple's estate. The court uses the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act to resolve the dispute. In accordance with the Act, Alice is considered to have predeceased Bob, but Bob is also considered to have predeceased Alice. The inheritance is divided equally among their closest living relatives, according to degree of kinship.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the symbol}} of the Sassanid state, the Drafsh e Kavian was irrevocably tied to the concept of Eranshahr and hence with the concept of Iranian nationhood. Thus, in 867, when Ya'qub-i Laith of the Saffarid dynasty <b>claimed</b> the <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> the kings of Persia and sought [...] "to revive their glory," [...] a poem written on his behalf sent to the Abbasid caliph said: [...] "With me is the Drafsh e Kavian, through which I hope to rule the nations." [...] Although no {{evidence}} that Ya'qub-i Laith ever recreated such a flag, star imagery in banners remained popular until the ascendance of the Lion and Sun symbol (after 1846).|$|R
50|$|The Sabbath Rest Advent Church is a Christian church {{which has}} its spiritual roots in the Seventh-day Advent Church. It <b>claims</b> the <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> Seventh-day Adventist theologians Ellet J. Waggoner and Alonzo T. Jones. The church proper was founded by Australian preacher Frederic T. Wright in 1954 and preached in New Zealand, Australia and later in North and Central America, Europe, and Africa. In Germany the church {{activities}} were first led by Wolfgang Meyer and later by Andreas Dura; the German branch can claim 100 to 150 members, and is headquartered in Dickendorf, where Wright is buried.
