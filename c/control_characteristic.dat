50|$|In {{calibrating}} ECUs, control {{behavior is}} modified for different vehicle models or variants. This {{is not done}} by making changes to the program code, but instead by changing the ECU’s parameterization. This {{involves the use of}} measurement and calibration systems such as CANape in the laboratory, on test benches or in vehicles during test trials. To evaluate the effects of changes to parameters, development engineers access the relevant process variables with conventional measurement technology at sensors and actuators and read out the data from the ECU. Measured data internal to the ECU, e.g. intermediate results of a computational function, can be accessed via ASAM standard protocols XCP or CCP and the ECU’s standard interfaces (CAN, FlexRay, LIN, Ethernet/BroadR-Reach). For a high-performance ECU access, data from microcontroller-specific interfaces (for example JTAG, DAP, AURORA) can be converted via an external hardware (like Vector’s VX1000 system) in XCP on Ethernet. A typical use case for calibration with CANape is online calibration. This involves modifying parameters directly in the ECU. The resulting <b>control</b> <b>characteristic</b> can be measured and checked directly. Using this approach, measured data from the ECU or physical measurement variables on or in the vehicle can be precisely analyzed {{to determine the effects of}} each individual change.|$|E
