40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we tested the {{validity}} of <b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> and peer <b>justice,</b> measured as second-order constructs, in a real work setting. First, we investigated the appropriateness of aggregating first-order facets of <b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> and peer <b>justice</b> to work-unit level of analysis. Second, we examined {{the construct validity of}} <b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> and peer <b>justice</b> as two different factor structures. Third, we tested the hierarchical structure of <b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> and peer <b>justice</b> as second-order factors. Finally, we examined the predictive validity of second-order factors <b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> and peer <b>justice</b> within a nomological network composed of reciprocity with the supervisor and reciprocity with coworkers. We conducted these analyses in a sample of 532 employees nested in 79 organizations. Our results suggest the validity of <b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> and peer <b>justice</b> measured as second-order factors. We discuss these results and their implications for organizational justice research...|$|R

40|$|While {{the lion}} 2 ̆ 7 s share of {{organizational}} justice {{research focuses on}} individual perceptions, researchers have recognized the value of group perceptions in understanding <b>justice</b> phenomena. <b>Justice</b> <b>climate</b> (i. e., shared perceptions of fairness among workgroup members) has often been studied using facet-specific and source-specific <b>justice</b> <b>climates</b> (e. g. procedural <b>justice</b> <b>climate,</b> supervisor <b>justice</b> <b>climate)</b> demonstrating the predictive power of group level perceptions of fairness. However, little research has explored the boundary conditions of <b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> effects. In this study, I propose that overall <b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> has {{a significant impact on}} group prosocial and deviant behaviors. I also propose that group perceptions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and group moral identity moderate these effects and that these three variables (<b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> perceptions, group CSR perceptions, and group differences in moral identity) interact to impact organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) and deviance. A laboratory study was carried out to test these hypotheses. Results showed a significant effect for overall <b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> and a near marginal three-way interaction effect for overall <b>justice</b> <b>climate,</b> group moral identity, and group CSR perceptions.

2500|$|In 2014, {{students}} from Fossil Free ANU organised the first student-initiated referendum at the ANU and in elections in September more than 82 per cent of students voted {{in favour of}} the ANU divesting from fossil fuels in what was the highest turnout in a student election at the university {{in more than a}} decade. In October 2014, the ANU Council announced that it would divest from seven companies, two of which, Santos and Oil Search, performed poorly in an independent review undertaken by the Centre for Australian Ethical Research. This decision provoked a month-long controversy with the Australian Financial Review publishing over 53 stories criticising the decision including 12 front pages attacking the ANU, with its editor-in-chief, Michael Stutchbury, prouncing the decision to be as [...] "disingenuous" [...] as banning the burqa. These attacks, which The Canberra Times editorial described as [...] "verging on hysterical" [...] was joined by members of the cabinet of the Abbott Government, with the Treasurer Joe Hockey stating that the ANU Council is [...] "removed from the reality of what is helping to drive the Australian economy and create more employment," [...] Education Minister Christopher Pyne calling it [...] "bizarre" [...] and Prime Minister Tony Abbott calling it [...] "stupid."

40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} whether organizational <b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> at the workplace level is associated with individual staff members’ perceptions of care quality and affective commitment to the workplace. Methods The study adopts a cross-sectional multi-level design. Data were collected using an electronic survey and a response rate of 75 % was obtained. Organizational <b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> and affective commitment to the workplace were measured by items from Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire and quality of care by three self-developed items. Non-managerial staff working at dental clinics with at least five respondents (n = 900 from 68 units) was included in analyses. A set of Level- 2 random intercept models were built to predict individual-level organizational affective commitment and perceived quality of care from unit-level organizational <b>justice</b> <b>climate,</b> controlling for potential confounding by group size, gender, age, and occupation. Results The results of the empty model showed substantial between-unit variation for both affective commitment (ICC- 1 = 0. 17) and quality of care (ICC- 1 = 0. 12). The overall results showed that the shared perception of organizational <b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> at the clinical unit level was significantly associated with perceived quality of care and affective commitment to the organization (p < 0. 001). Conclusions Organizational <b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> at work unit level explained all variation in affective commitment among dental clinics and was associated with both the individual staff members’ affective commitment and perceived quality of care. These findings suggest a potential for that addressing organizational <b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> may be a way to promote quality of care and enhancing affective commitment. However, longitudinal studies are needed to support causality in the examined relationships. Intervention research is also recommended to probe the effectiveness of actions increasing unit-level organizational <b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> and test their impact on quality of care and affective commitment...|$|R

40|$|Early work on leader-member {{exchange}} (LMX) theory {{suggested that}} leaders differentiating followers into in-groups and out-groups leads to superior group performance. However, research on LMX has almost exclusively studied individual outcomes {{as opposed to}} group outcomes. In addition, the notion of differentiation suggests that not all group members have high quality relationships with their leaders thereby violating rules surrounding experienced organizational justice. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} dissertation is to conceptualize and study LMX at the level of analysis at which it was initially conceptualized (i. e., the work group level), and {{to examine the effects of}} LMX level (i. e., mean in group members' LMX scores) and LMX strength (i. e., variance in group members' LMX scores, i. e., differentiation) on group performance (i. e., unit-level customer satisfaction) and group-level fairness perceptions (i. e., <b>justice</b> <b>climates).</b> Drawing on LMX, organizational justice, social comparison theory, and multilevel theory and research, I derived a number of testable hypotheses involving the relationship between LMX level and LMX strength on <b>justice</b> <b>climates</b> and group performance. There were three major sets of findings regarding (1) : the effects of LMX level, (2) the effects of LMX differentiation (later called LMX strength), (3) and the moderating roles of task interdependence and group size on the LMX strength to <b>justice</b> <b>climates</b> relationships. First, LMX level was positively related to justice climates; however, the relationship between LMX level and customer satisfaction was not significant. Second, as predicted, LMX strength was negatively related to <b>justice</b> <b>climates,</b> but, incongruent with the differentiation (strength) hypothesis of LMX theory, there was not a significant relationship between LMX strength and customer satisfaction. Third, consistent with the hypothesis, task interdependence moderated the relationship between LMX strength and <b>justice</b> <b>climates</b> such that <b>justice</b> <b>climates</b> were more favorable when strength was high and task interdependence was high. Collectively, these results suggest that having variability (i. e., differentiation) in the quality of relationships in a work group may have negative effects on <b>justice</b> <b>climates,</b> particularly when individuals must work interdependently; but a negligible direct effect on group performance.

40|$|Fairness is {{important}} to people in different roles, especially in the workplace. Scientists have traditionally studied organizational justice {{at the individual level}} of analysis, dealing with employees' individual justice evaluations. Although this perspective remains important, justice can be explored at the group level of analysis as well. <b>Justice</b> <b>climate</b> represents team members' shared perception of justice in the workplace. It usually emerges through modeling behavior, or through the social information processing. Shared justice perceptions can originate from the processes that, as the time goes by, make co-workers more similar to one other. Individuals and teams assess three things: outcomes (distributive justice), decision-making processes (procedural justice) and interpersonal treatment (interactional justice). Teams, as well as individuals, can attribute (in) justice to numerous sources, as long as they hold that source accountable for the treatment they are experiencing. Therefore, employees can evaluate formal authorities' <b>justice</b> (<b>climate),</b> such as supervisor or organization as a whole, but the <b>justice</b> (<b>climate)</b> from the ones that do not have the formal authority over each other, their peers or clients. Accordingly, employees can simultaneously perceive one source as entirely fair while the other as completely unfair. Perceptions of justice, both individual and group ones, are associated with numerous organizationally relevant outcomes, expressed in the form of attitudes or behaviors. The interaction of different sources of <b>justice</b> (<b>climate)</b> has significant effects on employees (shared) reactions as well. <b>Justice</b> <b>climate,</b> as a collective construct, is differentially operationalized at the higher level: additive compositional model, direct consensus model, referent-shift approach model, dispersion model and the process composition model. This paper provides an overview of the up-to-date findings, as well as the guidelines for further <b>justice</b> <b>climate</b> research. </p...|$|R
