40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyses}} {{the choice}} between different transport modes, based {{on the concept of}} total logistics costs. Not only the cost of transportation itself is considered, but also all the other costs that arise in the supply chain, such as the costs of goods handling, the <b>costs</b> of inventory <b>carrying,</b> etc. In a first case-study, based on real-market data, {{the choice between}} road haulage and inland navigation is analysed for an annual volume of 55. 000 tonnes of bulk goods. In this case-study the trade-off between transport <b>costs</b> and inventory <b>carrying</b> <b>costs</b> is shown: inland navigation has lower transport costs, but its inventory <b>carrying</b> <b>costs</b> are higher. Due {{to the fact that the}} bulk goods considered have a low value, leading to low inventory <b>carrying</b> <b>costs,</b> inland navigation turns out to be the cheapest transport mode from the viewpoint of total logistics costs. It is shown that for goods with a significantly higher value (and thus larger inventory <b>carrying</b> <b>costs),</b> the difference in total logistics costs between both transport modes becomes very small. In a second case-study, a comparison is made between rail transport, inland navigation and road haulage for a volume of 80. 000 tonnes of bulk goods per year. Both rail transport and inland navigation require precarriage and/or oncarriage by truck, as well as goods handling. This increases the transport costs of both modes considerably. As a result, road haulage turns out to be the cheapest transport mode from the viewpoint of the total logistics costs. However, when a larger ship type can be deployed than the one currently used, the balance turns in favour of inland navigation...|$|R

5000|$|Channel {{stuffing}} has {{a number}} of long-term consequences for a company. Firstly, distributors will often return any unsold goods to the company, incurring a <b>carrying</b> <b>cost</b> and also developing a backlog of product inventory. Wildly fluctuating demand, combined with this excess inventory, leads to costly overtimes and factory shutdowns. Even mild channel stuffing can spiral out of control as sales works to make up for prior over-selling. Discounts used to drive trade loading can greatly affect profits, and even help establish gray market channels as salesmen no longer adequately qualify their prospects.|$|E
50|$|Another {{way to look}} at a {{distribution}} center is to see it as a production or manufacturing operation. Goods arrive in bulk, they are stored until needed, retrieved, and assembled into shipments. The efficient processing of {{a distribution}} center can greatly impact the final price of the product delivered to the end user. Efficient processing not only directly impacts the cost of goods through reduced labor, but it also indirectly impacts the cost of goods through reduced inventory. Inventory represents an investment with its associated investment interest or inventory <b>carrying</b> <b>cost.</b> Reducing the processing time of order processing can directly reduce the amount of inventory necessary to be stocked in the operation (see demand chain management).|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend the {{classical}} economic batch size model of Camp to situations where {{a range of}} products is made to stock and where the products are manufactured in a production shop consisting {{of a number of}} work centers of functionally grouped machines. Assuming that the flow times of the batches along the work centers can be modelled as a queueing process, it is shown that the batch sizes influence the batch waiting times in the shop, and the amount of work in process. The cost function to be minimized consists of ordering costs, final inventory holding <b>costs,</b> and work-in-process <b>carrying</b> <b>costs.</b> We show that the cost function is strictly convex and that the optimal batch sizes can be found by means of well-known numerical methods. We present an outline of an iterative procedure in which the batch size optimization procedure is combined with a shop load optimization procedure to achieve a good overall performance. Using a simplified model that assumes that the products are homogeneous in all respects, we also show that there exists an upper limit for the optimal batch size, which is determined by the ordering costs and the work-in-process <b>carrying</b> <b>costs.</b> Finally, we show that not taking into account work-in-process <b>carrying</b> <b>costs</b> may result in substantial errors in both batch size and cost...|$|R
50|$|A {{positive}} {{working capital}} cycle balances incoming and outgoing payments to minimize {{net working capital}} and maximize free cash flow. For example, a company that pays its suppliers in 30 days but takes 60 days to collect its receivables has a working capital cycle of 30 days. This 30-day cycle usually needs to be funded through a bank operating line, and the interest on this financing is a <b>carrying</b> <b>cost</b> that reduces the company's profitability. Growing businesses require cash, {{and being able to}} free up cash by shortening the working capital cycle is the most inexpensive way to grow. Sophisticated buyers review closely a target's working capital cycle because it provides them with an idea of the management's effectiveness at managing their balance sheet and generating free cash flows.|$|E

50|$|Contango is a {{potential}} trap for unwary investors. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) {{provide an opportunity for}} small investors to participate in commodity futures markets, which is tempting in periods of low interest rates. Between 2005 and 2010 the number of futures-based commodity ETFs rose from two to ninety-five, and the total assets rose from 3.9 to nearly 98 billion USD in the same period. Because the normal course of a futures contract in a market in contango is to decline in price, a fund composed of such contracts buys the contracts at the high price (going forward) and closes them out later at the usually lower spot price. The money raised from the low priced, closed out contracts will not buy the same number of new contracts going forward. Funds can and have lost money even in fairly stable markets. There are strategies to mitigate this problem, including allowing the ETF to create a stock of precious metals for the purpose of allowing investors to speculate on fluctuations in its value. But storage costs will be quite variable, and copper ingots require considerably more storage space, and thus <b>carrying</b> <b>cost,</b> than gold, and command lower prices in world markets: it is unclear how well a model that works for gold will work with other commodities. Industrial scale buyers of major commodities, particularly when compared to small retail investors, retain an advantage in futures markets. The raw material cost of the commodity {{is only one of many}} factors that influence their final costs and prices. Contango pricing strategies that catch small investors by surprise are intuitively obvious to the managers of a large firm, who must decide whether to take delivery of a product today, at today's spot price, and store it themselves, or pay more for a forward contract, and let someone else do the storage for them.|$|E
