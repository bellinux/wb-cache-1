5|$|In 2011, UBS {{agreed to}} pay US$160 million in restitution, {{penalties}} and disgorgement of profits for rigging bids in the U.S. municipal bond market, after the bank and three of its employees were charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2010. In July 2013, the three employees were convicted of conspiracy in the muni market fraud: former UBS Vice President Gary Heinz was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined US$400,000; former UBS global commodities chief Peter Ghavami was sentenced to 18 months and fined US $1 million; and former UBS VP Michael Welty received a 16-month sentence and fined US$300,000. In addition to conspiracy, Ghavami and Heinz also were convicted of wire fraud. Federal prosecutors had asked for much harsher sentences, but U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood rebuffed the request. Wood said that the <b>criminal</b> <b>behavior</b> of the three was an aberration from their normal law-abiding lives.|$|E
5|$|In the Hanzhong state, sin and <b>criminal</b> <b>behavior</b> {{were not}} differentiated. In order to {{eliminate}} sin, an adherent {{first had to}} acknowledge his crime, and then {{would have to go}} to a 'quiet room' to meditate. There, he would have to write three confessions which would be offered to the Lord of Heaven, the Lord of Earth and the Lord of Water. For public crimes, an accused would be pardoned three times for his actions and then be sentenced. A sentence depended on the type of crime, but always involved community service. For a minor crime, the sentence was usually to repair a road. A repeat offender might be asked to donate building materials to improve local buildings. Other laws banned alcohol and prohibited the killing of animals during the spring and summer.|$|E

The study focused on 1254 Dutch adolescents {{with a mean age}} of 16 years (middle adolescents cohort 13 - 16 year, n = 875, 69. 2 %; late adolescents cohort 17 - 23 year, n = 379, 30. 8 %) from the general population. The population of this study consists of 604 boys and 650 girls. Longitudinal data had been used for this study. The current study demonstrated that both kinds of parental control doesn’t influences the <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviors</b> of adolescents.

40|$|Once {{believed}} to be a poor inner city neighborhood characteristic, youth violence and crime are now recognized as problems in rural areas as well (Osgood and Chambers 2000). Studies on their etiology remain scarce, particularly with a focus on minority youth. Given the importance of individual characteristics and a positive future orientation (educational aspirations) during adolescence, the current study tested a risk-protective factor approach with measures of risk proneness, self-esteem, educational commitment, and educational expectations to predict both direct and “indirect ” measures of violence and <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviors</b> (assault, encounters with law enforcement, and court appearances) in samples of rural (n= 687) and non-rural (n= 182) African American youth. Results show that self-esteem, risk-proneness, and educational commitment were highly associated with measures of violent and <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviors</b> in both samples. Importantly, no differences were found in how risk or protective factors were associated with measures of violence and crime in rural and non-rural developmental contexts. Rural communities are often perceived as safe areas that are generally less prone to violence and <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviors</b> (Frank 2003). This view is corroborated by official data reporting that, for example in 2005, whereas rates of violent crimes accounted for 514. 6 violent incidents per 100, 000 inhabitants in urban areas, rural areas reported only 199. 2 violent incidents per 100, 000 (NCVS 2005).

40|$|Criminal {{responsibility}} {{is an important}} factor in criminal offense. Determining a criminal responsibility of people with mental disorders is problematic. Mental disorders affect free will because they can affect one’s ability to determine his or her alternative action. This juridical normative research studied the correlation between mental disorders and <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviors,</b> the <b>criminal</b> responsibility of people with mental disorders, and the settlement of criminal offense done by people with mental disorders at the investigation phase and before the court. Nearly all of mental disorders are related to <b>criminal</b> <b>behaviors</b> because they affect reasoning abilities.

It has been suggested that the treatments that may be most likely to be effective at reducing overt antisocial and <b>criminal</b> <b>behavior</b> are those that focus on self-interest, emphasizing the tangible, material value of prosocial behavior, with interventions that develop skills to obtain what the patient wants out of life in prosocial rather than antisocial ways. To this end, various therapies have been tried with the aim of reducing the criminal activity of incarcerated offenders with psychopathy, with mixed success. As psychopathic individuals are insensitive to sanction, reward-based management, in which small privileges are granted in exchange for good behavior, has been suggested and used to manage their behavior in institutional settings.|$|E
