5|$|Boletus edulis is {{well suited}} to drying—its flavour intensifies, it is easily reconstituted, and its {{resulting}} texture is pleasant.

40|$|The {{proximate}} {{composition and}} various specific components of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, in the catch season between March and August were investigated. Frozen krill were freeze-dried and milled. The proximate composition comprised water, proteins, fats, ash, fatty acids, and amino acids, while the specific components were vitamins, minerals, nucleotides, betaine, and astaxanthin. The moisture {{content of the}} krill ranged from 77 to 80 %, with the highest value in June, and the ash <b>content</b> <b>was</b> be-tween 12 and 13 %. The protein <b>content</b> <b>was</b> lowest in May, and the fat <b>content</b> <b>was</b> 18 – 19 %, with the highest value in March. The amino acid content varied according to the season: taurine and glycine were highest in August; β-alanine was higher in April and May; and arginine, ornithine, and lysine were highest in March. The unsaturated fat <b>content</b> <b>was</b> ~ 50 % and omega- 3 fatty acids were highest in June. Oil-soluble vitamins A and E were highest in March, and the water-soluble vitamin <b>content</b> <b>was</b> {{less than that of}} oil-soluble vitamins.

5|$|Boron is an {{essential}} plant nutrient, required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0ppm lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron <b>content</b> <b>is</b> greater than 1.8ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the effect of autoclaving, toasting and cooking processes on raw hatchery waste with shell and without shell. Average crude protein contents of hatchery waste meal (with shell) were 18. 17 % due to cooking and 16. 83 % due to toasting. Crude fibre <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> the lowest under cooking process. Crude fat <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> reduced to 11. 44 % by autoclaving. Total ash <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> increased substantially during all treatments. Calcium <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> reduced to 20 % due to autoclaving. Nitrogen Free Extract (NFE) contents and metabalizable energy <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> significantly modified. Average crude protein contents of hatchery waste meal (without shell) and crude fat <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> significantly increased (P< 0. 01) under respective processes. Total ash <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> reduced due to removal of egg shell. Calcium and phosphorus <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> also reduced significantly due to removal of eggshell. NFE <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> markedly reduced when there were no eggshell. Energy <b>contents</b> <b>were</b> significantly increased when there were no eggshell. Overall, results of hatchery waste without shell were better than with shell. However, hatchery waste meal with shell is rich source of calcium. Within processing, there were non-significant differences for all nutrients with no Salmonella and E. coli Average acid values of cooked hatchery waste meal were increased significantly (P< 0. 01) from 3. 04 to 7. 88 after 9 months of storage. Amino acid profile of unprocessed hatchery waste (with shell), cooked processed waste with and without shell revealed sufficient quantity of all essential amino acids, particularly cooked processed hatchery waste (without shell) contained the higher levels of lysine and methionine...|$|R
30|$|Alkalinity was {{determined}} {{according to the}} method number 2320 B Potentiometric titration to preselected pH 4.38. The TCOD {{was determined}} by the closed reflux colorimetric method (APHA 1992).
