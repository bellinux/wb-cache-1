40|$|The {{world is}} facing an {{overwhelming}} number of social and environmental challenges that necessitate immediate, collaborative action. Despite numerous efforts, campaigns, and calls for action, tractable change in the public's response is sluggish. Therefore, we need {{a better understanding of}} the barriers to and motivators for action (e. g., prosocial behavior, resource conservation). This dissertation is a first step to addressing this as it explores individuals' prosocial choices and behaviors, as well as certain factors underlying them within the domains of <b>charitable</b> giving, pro-environmental <b>choice,</b> and climate change judgments. The first two chapters provide an account of individuals' aversion to overhead in charitable giving. Chapter 1 describes how higher overhead spending decreases giving and that overhead aversion is largely explained by a decrease in the perceived impact of one's donation. A large field experiment demonstrates that covering overhead costs with outside funds significantly increases giving compared to traditional fundraising techniques. Chapter 2 focuses on nonprofit executive (CEO) pay, a particularly aversive type of overhead. As the salary of a nonprofit CEO increases, the likelihood that individuals will donate decreases. Moreover, individuals are willing to "undercut" a qualified CEO by offering him/ her significantly less money for a job if the organization is described as a nonprofit versus a for profit. Chapters 3 and 4 explore underlying factors that increase consumers' choice of green products and shed light on the psychology involved in climate change judgments. Chapter 3 finds that green choice is largely and consistently explained by real-time accessibility of eco-friendly concepts [...] -exposing individuals to green concepts prior to making a decision increases the likelihood they choose green products. Chapter 4 delves into the local warming effect, a phenomenon in which perceived abnormalities in current outdoor temperature influence climate change judgments. Results suggest the local warming effect arises due to attribute substitution, whereby individuals use accessible but irrelevant information over harder to process but more diagnostic information in making their judgments. This body of work improves our understanding of individuals' motivators and barriers to action in areas of critical global concern [...] -charitable behavior, resource conservation, and climate change actio...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{analyzes}} whether President Bush 2 ̆ 7 s <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> executive orders, which permit {{religious organizations}} {{to apply for}} federal funds to deliver social services, are a permissible exercise of presidential power. Although Congress has enacted <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> provisions in some major statutes, including a 1996 welfare reform act, it debated but did not extend <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> throughout the entire federal human services bureaucracy, as the President 2 ̆ 7 s executive orders do. The core question this Article examines is whether President Bush 2 ̆ 7 s <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> executive orders constitute permissible gap-filling of ambiguous statutes under the Chevron doctrine or impermissible exercises of executive lawmaking under Youngstown Sheet 2 ̆ 6 Tube Co. v. Sawyer. This Article analyzes possible statutory delegations to the executive branch, including human services statutes and federal procurement laws and concludes {{that they do not}} contain gaps that give policy-making discretion to the President. With regard to constitutional authority for the orders, recent Supreme Court case law makes clear that <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> programs are not constitutionally compelled. Article II of the Constitution, which gives the President the authority to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, is another possible source of authority, but its bounds are ill defined. Fans of a strong executive argue that presidential policy-making best serves constitutional values of accountability and efficiency. This Article tests these assumptions and finds that the <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> executive orders not only fail to further these values, but actually may undermine them. Accordingly, the Article concludes that the <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> executive orders constitute an unlawful aggrandizement of executive power...|$|E
40|$|Since 1996, {{the federal}} {{government}} has undertaken major initiatives to fund religious organizations to deliver social services. These programs, called <b>charitable</b> <b>choice,</b> continue to expand and now account for over $ 2 billion in social welfare spending. However, <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> blurs the lines between church and state and is thus highly controversial. This article reflects on ten years of experience with <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> and assesses the impact and effectiveness of these programs. There is little empirical evidence that faith-based social services are superior to secular programs. Moreover, religious grantees, and congregations in particular, are often unable to manage large federal grants and to maintain the constitutional balance required by <b>charitable</b> <b>choice.</b> Nevertheless, religious organizations have reserves of social capital that can be effectively channeled in the fight on poverty. Thus, this article suggests ways in which government can partner productively with congregations while avoiding the pitfalls inherent in current <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> programs. While congregations are ill-suited for delivering welfare counseling services that are transformative in nature, they are ideally suited to deliver discrete, sustenance-based services as well as to serve as links between the needy and other community groups and governmental providers...|$|E

At least 19 states have contracted with faith-based organizations (FBOs) to provide some welfare services. Moreover, states are using various approaches to implement <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> legislation. For example, some states have created state faith-based liaisons to promote greater awareness of <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> provisions or removed barriers to contracting with FBOs. Several factors have limited the establishment of collaborations between FBOs and states, including some FBOs' lack of awareness and understanding of <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> provisions, their reluctance to partner with government, and the limited financial and administrative capacity of some FBOs. Once collaborations have occurred, some small FBOs have had problems (1) covering ongoing costs while awaiting government reimbursement or (2) managing the performance-based contracts because of limited technological and management systems. GAO found no information with which to assess the effectiveness of FBOs as providers of social services. Although some anecdotal evidence suggests that FBOs have been successful, the research community has not rigorously examined the effectiveness of FBOs as social service providers. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{research is}} {{a study of the}} anthropology of policy with welfare reform in general and <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> in particular as its focus. The study begins with the notion that policies work as instruments of governance and consequently have social and political implications. These policies are examined by exploring the manner in which Catholic Charities and policy makers in Florida are responding to the <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> mandate and how their views are shaping local policies. The study is framed within anthropological principles pertaining to economic, humanistic and philosophical tenets. The study provides a historical background of poverty, the development of the welfare state in the United States {{as well as some of}} the social, economic, and political factors that shape social policies. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews conducted with representatives from Catholic Charities, government agencies, legislative committees, and faith-based organizations, and through document reviews. Data were analyzed qualitatively and were managed using the software Atlas. ti. Analysis of the data show that while there is increased convergence between the state and faith-based organizations (FBOs), there is some hesitancy on the part of religious organizations to assume full responsibility for the poor, particularly without having any funding guarantees. The data also suggests that through the implementation of <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> religious organizations face the risk of becoming highly dependent on the state and therefore loose their voice and the possibility of lobbying for the poor. Furthermore, the data suggests that there are some aspects of the implementation of <b>charitable</b> <b>choice</b> that have not received congressional approval and may eventually jeopardize the entire faith-based initiative...|$|E
