The stock rolls usually {{have the same}} width. Each working order requires pieces of the same size.

The approach proposed in this paper assumes that the original roll can be slit into a strip and a partial roll. The strip is used to fulfill the current order. The partial roll {{will be used to}} fulfill future orders and cannot be slit further. The approach determines several standard widths for the partial rolls and uses a greedy procedure to select the roll (either the original roll or a partial roll) to fulfill the current order.

30|$|According to Koch [5], {{quality of}} peripheral-planed {{surfaces}} is generally improved by short wavelengths (or feed per knife) and low height of knife marks. This is generally accomplished {{by increasing the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>circle</b> diameter, number of jointed knives, or by reducing feed speed. Indeed, reduction in feed speed decreases the normal cutting force [5, 6] by reducing chip dimensions. Rake angle and jointing operation are also important factors influencing surface quality during planing process. For several species, better surface quality is observed as rake angle decreases from 30 ° to 15 ° [7 – 9], whereas the effect of jointing operation depends on wood species and knife wear [3, 10, 11]. On the other hand, Carrano et al. [6] reported an increase in surface quality when decreasing the depth of cut. However, Iskra and Hernández [12] found that surface quality is not affected by depth of cut during routing paper birch wood with different grain orientations. Difference between these two studies {{could be related to}} the efficiency of feeding systems used for conducting the experiments (vibrational effects).|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{urgency of}} the problem with {{training}} specialists in laparoscopic techniques is due to the wide introduction of minimally invasive technologies into surgical practice. Previously untrained, a surgeon runs considerable difficulties with the coordination of movements and the use of tools, which may lead to both the longer life of surgical aids and damage to the viscera and vascular structures in a patient. Many factors influence the level of manual skills in the audience at the beginning of training, which further affect its duration and hence cost. Objective. To evaluate the effect of initial level of basic manual skills {{for the duration of the}} study. Materials and methods. The investigation enrolled 255 listeners: medical students, interns, residents, and practicing surgeons. Manual skills as single successive performance of exercises 1 (peg transfers) and 2 (<b>cutting</b> a <b>circle)</b> in an endotrainer box were tested before training. The correlation of the results of testing for the rate of formation of basic laparoscopic skills was then analyzed. Results. According to the results of the testing, only 20 % of the physicians showed a result of less than 110 s and were ready for being further taught in intracorporeal suturing techniques. The authors consider that all students and interns/residents and most physicians must start their training in laparoscopic technique from a series of basic exercises. The analysis revealed a correlation between the results of doing exercises 1 and 2 and the number of their repetitions to achieve the needed level (r = 0. 66). Conclusion. The single performance of peg transfers and <b>cutting</b> a <b>circle</b> exercises before training could objectively measure the performance of laparoscopic skills, define an individual plan, and optimize the costs of the training. </p...|$|R

These exercises were placing a pipe cleaner through four small circles, placing beads {{in the form}} of a B on a board, stretching out a rubber band around 16 nails on a wooden board, <b>cutting</b> a <b>circle</b> from a rubber glove and intracorporeal knot tying. The level of performance on each task was established by adding the time to completion of a task with penalty points, consequently rewarding precision and speed. Additionally, the resulting score could be compared to a pre-established expert level, used as performance standard [7]. Three hours of hands-on training started after a 10 -min introduction video in which the exercises were explained. For each two participants, one box trainer was available. Consequently, one resident could hold the camera, while the other performed the exercises. Approximately, half an hour was reserved for each participant per exercise. Six experts in minimally invasive gynecology supervised the training as tutors.

During each of seven sessions, they performed five tasks on an inanimate box trainer. Scores were calculated by adding up the time to completion of the task with penalty points, consequently rewarding speed and precision. The sum score was the sum of the five scores. One year later, seven of them underwent retention testing for the current study. The final test results were compared with retention test results as a measure of durability of acquired skills. Novices’ scores did not worsen significantly for four out of five tasks (i.e., placing a pipe cleaner p[*]=[*] 0.46, placing beads p[*]=[*] 0.24, <b>cutting</b> a <b>circle</b> p[*]=[*] 0.31, and knot tying p[*]=[*] 0.13). However, deterioration was observed in the performance on stretching a rubber band (p[*]<[*] 0.05), as well as in the sum score (p[*]<[*] 0.05).
