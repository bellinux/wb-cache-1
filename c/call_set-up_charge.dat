40|$|Abstract: Quality of Service (QoS) and {{resource}} management in Next Generation Networks (NGN) {{is provided by}} a particular architecture called RACF (Resource and Admission Control Function) which is introduced by ITU. In this paper we analyze the impact of different resource control schemes in RACF architecture on <b>Call</b> <b>Set-up</b> Delay (CSD) which is a QoS performance parameter {{that may be used}} in specifying, measuring and comparing the speed of <b>call</b> <b>set-up</b> processing in telecommunication networks. The approach taken is, initially, to introduce the RACF architecture and its main elements and protocols. Following this, we present two QoS signaling call flows for two resource control schemes and examine them using a queuing model. The simulation results show the different performance of these two schemes under different network traffic. Using these results, we can have some criteria for choosing the better resource control scheme appropriate to traffic changes.

In this paper, we analyze {{the performance of the}} H. 323 <b>call</b> <b>set-up</b> procedure over wireless links using a simple call model under two modes of operations, namely, Regular and Fast Connect. The proposed model assumes the presence of a radio link protocol (RLP) and recommends that the VoIP packets be transferred without any RLP retransmissions, while H. 323 control packets be transferred with RLP retransmissions. Our analytical models and detailed experiments show that the VoIP <b>call</b> <b>set-up</b> performance can undergo significant degradation if RLP is not used at all, even for moderately high frame error rates (FERs) in wireless links.

By using TLCs, our approach can improve the performance of updating and paging in comparison with previous approaches.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in both satellite and terrestrial mobile communications technologies are now {{leading to the}} realisation of {{the dream of the}} global personal communications within a few years. Satellite systems, as a complement to terrestrial cellular systems, are introduced into the future Personal Communication Networks (S-PCN) to provide global coverage and to allow global roaming. The inter-working and the integration between the satellite and the terrestrial cellular systems (e. g. GSM system) are the key issues in developing the network architecture and designing the control functions and signalling protocols of satellite systems. This thesis focuses on the design of a satellite signalling control system. The coverage and link properties of ICO 10 and LE 066 satellite constellations, the representatives of low earth orbit (LEO) and medium earth orbit (MEO) satellite systems, are considered. A satellite specific network architecture is proposed to accommodate the requirements of satellite dynamics and resource control function. The physical layer of satellite signalling links are designed to cope with the specific features of LEO or MEO satellite air-interfaces. In order to overcome problems specific to LEO or MEO satellite systems and to provide <b>call</b> <b>set-up</b> control function, three important signalling protocols are proposed for the S-PCNs. The priority based fast access scheme is designed for the satellite random access channel allowing low access delay for the <b>call</b> <b>set-up</b> related access packets, even when the channel load is high. The satellite diversity based paging approach is proposed to optimize the paging performance. The modified selective re-transmission (M-SRT) and Go-Back-N (M-GBN) protocols are proposed to cope with the transaction type transmission on the dedicated control channel. Simulation results have shown siginficant improvement of the M-SRT and M-GBN protocols in call setup delay. Two protocols are also compared in the aspects of implementation complexity and <b>call</b> <b>set-up</b> performance. Finally, the integration scenarios between satellite and GSM system have been examined for S-PCN in the call handling related functions and associated signalling protocols. The GSM higher layer signalling protocols are tailored to provide the call control related functions. The optimum integration scenario is derived under the criterion of minimum modifications to the GSM higher layer signalling protocols and minimum complexities of the control functions...|$|R

40|$|The need to {{cope with}} the {{mobility}} of users is very different between mobile and fixed communication systems. Mobility management is thus a key feature in the design of mobile systems. Techniques derived for terrestrial mobile systems cannot be used for mobile satellite systems that use constellations of satellites. A major theme of this thesis is the proposal and verification of such mobility management schemes for mobile satellite systems. Mobility management consists of location tracking, location area planning, positioning, location update method, paging method, signalling over air-interface and <b>call</b> <b>set-up</b> delay. New proposals are made for location updating, paging, positioning and database architectures for mobile satellite systems in this thesis. A method of implementing intelligent paging in mobile satellite systems is outlined and a method of finding optimal location area considering both air-interface and fixed network resources is explained. It is also demonstrated how the new schemes save on signalling load in the airinterface and fixed network, satellite power, terminal power, and reduce the size of the terminal and <b>call</b> <b>set-up</b> delay.

Alternatively, a second group of techniques change parameters in RRM processes, such as cell reselection (CR)[10] and HO[11]. Since tuning CR parameters is only effective during <b>call</b> <b>set-up,</b> the optimization of HO parameters is normally the preferred option.
