5|$|There are no {{specific}} blood tests that can diagnose cholangiocarcinoma by themselves. Serum levels of <b>carcinoembryonic</b> <b>antigen</b> (CEA) and CA19-9 are often elevated, {{but are not}} sensitive or specific enough {{to be used as}} a general screening tool.

There is no entirely specific immunohistochemical stain that can distinguish malignant from benign biliary ductal tissue, although staining for cytokeratins, <b>carcinoembryonic</b> <b>antigen,</b> and mucins may aid in diagnosis.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{has been}} described for the purification of the <b>carcinoembryonic</b> <b>antigens</b> (CEA) of the human digestive system. Tumor tissue extraction in 0. 6 M perchloric acid followed by paper block electrophoresis and column chromatography on Sephadex G- 200 resulted in highly purified CEA preparations as determined by both immunological and physicochemical criteria. The properties and composition of five different purified CEA preparations derived from digestive system cancer metastases were examined. The findings demonstrated {{a high degree of}} uniformity amongst these samples. Sedimentation coefficients ranged from 6. 9 to 8 S. Each sample showed the presence of 14 different amino acid residues and six different carbohydrate constituents (four of which could be quantitated with the amount of material available for analyis). Studies of a purified CEA preparation from a primary hepatoma yielded results which, in some respects, differed from those obtained with the CEA samples of metastatic tumor origin. The implications of these variations were discussed with regard to the probable presence of non-CEA components in the hepatoma preparation. Of primary importance was the observation that the few normal adult digestive system tissues tested failed to show the presence of constituents similar to the CEA. This finding would seem to indicate that, in the adult, the <b>carcinoembryonic</b> <b>antigens</b> of the human digestive system are qualitatively tumor-specific and are not dectectable in comparable normal tissues...|$|R
25|$|A second marker, <b>carcinoembryonic</b> <b>antigen</b> (CEA), also {{produced}} by medullary thyroid carcinoma, is {{released into the}} blood and it is useful as a serum or blood tumor marker. In general, measurement of serum CEA is less sensitive than serum calcitonin for detecting {{the presence of a}} tumor, but has less minute to minute variability and is therefore useful as an indicator of tumor mass.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{use of the}} {{thymidine}} kinase makes use of the presence in some tumor cells of substances not present in normal cells (tumor markers). Such tumor markers are, for instance, CEA (<b>carcinoembryonic</b> <b>antigen)</b> and AFP (alpha fetoprotein). The genes for these tumor markers {{may be used as}} promoter genes for {{thymidine kinase}}. Thymidine kinase can then be activated in cells expressing the tumor marker but not in normal cells, such that treatment with ganciclovir kills only the tumor cells. Such gene therapy-based approaches are still experimental, however, as problems associated with targeting the gene transfer to the tumor cells have not yet been completely solved.|$|E
25|$|Immature, or solid, teratomas are {{the most}} common type of ovarian germ cell tumor, making up 40–50% of cases. Teratomas are {{characterized}} by the presence of disorganized tissues arising from all three embryonic germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm; immature teratomas also have undifferentiated stem cells that make them more malignant than mature teratomas (dermoid cysts). The different tissues are visible on gross pathology and often include bone, cartilage, hair, mucus, or sebum, but these tissues are not visible from the outside, which appears to be a solid mass with lobes and cysts. Histologically, they have large amounts of neuroectoderm organized into sheets and tubules along with glia; the amount of neural tissue determines the histologic grade. Immature teratomas usually only affect one ovary (10% co-occur with dermoid cysts) and usually metastasize throughout the peritoneum. They can also cause mature teratoma implants to grow throughout the abdomen in a disease called growing teratoma syndrome; these are usually benign but will continue to grow during chemotherapy, and often necessitate further surgery. Unlike mature teratomas, immature teratomas form many adhesions, making them less likely to cause ovarian torsion. There is no specific marker for immature teratomas, but <b>carcinoembryonic</b> <b>antigen</b> (CEA), CA-125, CA19-9, or AFP can sometimes indicate an immature teratoma.|$|E
50|$|In {{experiments}} {{conducted by}} Doyle et al., {{it was found}} that MCF-7, a breast adenomacarcinoma cell line, did not express the H19 gene; however a subline of MCF-7 with a multidrug resistance phenotype, MCF-7/AdrVp, had upregulation of H19. Curiously, mutant revertant MCF-7/AdrVp cells that lost their multidrug resistance and became drug-sensitive also lost H19 expression. Drug-resistant MCF-AdrVp cells do not overexpress P-glycoprotein, a cell membrane efflux pump commonly found in multidrug resistant cells; instead, they overexpress a 95kD membrane glycoprotein p95. p95, or NCA-90, is related to <b>carcinoembryonic</b> <b>antigens,</b> which have been found to reduce drug toxicity by Kawaharata et al.|$|R
40|$|Plaster is an {{important}} form of gypsum that mainly used in building construction. Breast cancer was investigated among women exposure to the dust of such material. The levels of CA 15 - 3 and <b>carcinoembryonic</b> <b>antigens</b> (CEA) as indicators for breast cancer were measured in the serum of 120 women working in a plaster factory. All of involved women showed a normal level of CEA, while 12. 5 % of them had moderately elevated levels of CA 15 - 3. In conclusion; plaster dust has no significant effect to cause breast cancer in working women. Moderately high levels of CA 15 - 3 in some of exposed women may relate to liver diseases...|$|R

Based on these findings, we suspected rectal cancer recurrence, and the CT scan revealed a 30 -mm tumor in the segment 7 of the liver (Fig.  2 c). There were no other distant metastases in the gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy.

The procedures used for synthesizing BMNs consisting of anticarcinoembryonic antigens (anti-CEAs) coated on dextran-coated Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (MF-DEX- 0060, MagQu Corp., Taiwan) {{were similar to those}} used in a previous study for synthesizing dextran-coated Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles coated with anti-goat C-reactive protein [22]. Dextran-coated Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles was oxidized using NaIO 4 to create aldehyde groups (−CHO), and dextran reacted with the antibodies of anti-CEAs (10 C-CR 2014 M 5, Fitzgerald, MA, USA) through −CH = N- to covalently conjugate the antibodies of anti-CEAs. After magnetic separation, the unbound antibodies were separated from conjugated BMNs consisting of dextran-coated Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles coated with anticarcinoembryonic antigens (Fe 3 O 4 -anti-CEAs). Subsequently, a reagent was synthesized by dissolving the BMNs in phosphate-buffered saline. The biotargets were <b>carcinoembryonic</b> <b>antigens</b> (CEAs; 30 -AC 30, Fitzgerald, MA, USA).

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of human adult and fetal tissues were studied by immune-diffusion {{techniques}} in agar gel {{to determine whether they}} contained the tumor-specific antigen(s) previously found in coionic cancers. In the adult tissues it was demonstrated that identical antigens were present in all tested specimens of malignant tumors of the entodermally derived epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, but were absent from all other tested adult tissues. The common antigenic constituents, therefore, represent system-specific cancer antigens of the human digestive system. System-specific cancer antigens have not previously been demonstrated in humans. Experiments with fetal tissues demonstrated that identical antigens were also present in fetal gut, liver, and pancreas between 2 and 6 months of gestation. These components were named "carcinoembryonic" antigens of the human digestive system. On the basis of the present findings and the recent work regarding control of the expression of genetic potentialities in various types of cells, it was concluded that the <b>carcinoembryonic</b> <b>antigens</b> represent cellular constituents which are repressed during the course of differentiation of the normal digestive system epithelium and reappear in the corresponding malignant cells by a process of derepressive-dedifferentiation...|$|R

40|$|Conflicting {{evolutionary}} interests {{between mother}} and offspring are hypothesized to drive an evolutionary arms race during mammalian pregnancy, and thus, positive selection may cause the rapid divergence of placental proteins that affect maternal or fetal fitness. We investigated the genomic consequences of placental expression in rodents and report that a substantial proportion (20. 5 %) of genes specifically expressed in the mature placenta are rapidly evolving. Moreover, we found that most rapidly evolving genes belong to just three pregnancy-related gene families: placental cathepsins, prolactins, and placental <b>carcinoembryonic</b> <b>antigens.</b> We then sequenced the most rapidly evolving gene, trophoblast-specific protein alpha (Tpbpa), in nine different Mus species/subspecies and found evidence of positive selection within the Mus lineage, with an excess of nonsynonymous changes clustering near a functionally important interaction site.

40|$|Various Escherichia coli and Salmonella strains {{bound to}} {{glycoprotein}}s {{of the family}} of <b>carcinoembryonic</b> <b>antigens</b> (CEA). As judged from plateau regions of the binding curves, CEA, nonspecific cross-reacting antigen of Mr 55, 000 (NCA- 55), and biliary glycoprotein of Mr 85, 000 (BGP- 85) showed similar binding activities. The binding to ovalbumin was significantly lower and the binding to fetuin was insignificant under identical experimental conditions. The binding of E. coli and S. typhi to the different glycoproteins was similar as judged from the binding curves. In comparison with alpha-methyl-D-mannopyranoside, aromatic alpha-glycosides of mannose were more potent binding inhibitors of E. coli but not of salmonellae to CEA and NCA- 55. These results are similar to those previously obtained with intestinal epithelial cells and yeast cells (N. Firon, S. Ashkenazi, D. Mirelman, I. Ofek, and N. Sharon, Infect. Immun. 55 : 472 - 476, 1987). The binding of E. coli to CEA was inhibited by purified type 1 fimbriae.

40|$|The {{topographical}} organisation of the epithelium lining mucous membranes {{has been}} an intense point of research. One of the fundamental biological issues underpinning this and associated issues relates to the role and regulation of epithelial adhesion molecules. Adhesion between individual cells allows an intact layer to be formed, which is selectively permeable. In addition, the orchestrated regulation of multiple adhesion molecules allows the gradual transition from basal secretory cells to apical absorptive cells in the crypt-villus gradient. Moreover, it is becoming clear that no one class of adhesion molecule can sufficiently govern crypt architecture; however, the main cell-cell adhesion molecules are the cadherins and the related desmosomal cadherins. These latter molecules interact with the catenins, which bind directly or indirectly with cytoskeletal molecules such as Rho and Rac. In addition, other complex glycoproteins, such as the <b>carcinoembryonic</b> <b>antigens,</b> might contribute to adhesion, although their mechanisms of function are distinctly different. Integrins on the basal aspect of the cells also signal important morphoregulatory signals {{as a result of}} their binding to the extracellular maxtrix. The disruption of these physiological processes also provides a necessary and, in some cases, sufficient molecular mechanism for cancer invasion and metastasis, such as occurs in E-cadherin mutation positive familial gastric cancer...|$|R

Materials and Methods: From June 2010 to December 2011, we analyzed the positive rates of biomarkers in 276 NSCLC patients. We assessed the relationship between biomarkers and clinical characteristics of sex, smoking history, and disease stage. Results: The median and positive rates of each serum biomarker were marked as 1. 91 – 22. 77 ng/ml and 35. 86 % (CEA), 2. 0 – 6. 77 ng/ml and 50 % (CYFRA 21 - 1), 13. 91 – 23. 78 ng/ml and 62. 31 % (NSE), and 56 – 67 μ/ml and 10. 14 % (TSGF). The level of CEA in peripheral (2. 43 – 23. 76 ng/ml) was significantly higher than the level at central position (1. 97 – 3. 63 ng/ml) (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Although the positive CEA, CYFRA 21 - 1, NSE, and TSGF rates were observed at low values during the NSLCLC serum diagnosis, they still {{played an important role in}} diagnosing lung cancer. Significant levels of CEA, CYFRA 21 - 1, NSE, and TSGF were detected in the serum.

40|$|Studies {{previously}} reported from this laboratory {{revealed that the}} human adenocarcinoraas tested, arising from the entodermally derived digestive system epithelium, contained identical tumor-specific antigens (1, 2). Similar constituents were found in embryonic and fetal gut, pancreas, and liver {{during the first two}} trimesters of gestation. Because these antigenic components could not be detected in any other normal, diseased, or neoplastic human tissues, they were named <b>carcinoembryonic</b> <b>antigens</b> (CEA) of the human digestive system. It was suggested that the CEA may represent cellular constituents which are repressed during the course of differentiation of the normal digestive system epithelium and which reappear in the corresponding malignant cells by a process of derepressive dedifferentiation. Preliminary experiments utilizing extraction in 0. 6 ~ perchloric acid suggested that the CEA may be protein-polysaccharide complexes, and immunological data suggested that the tumor-specific antigenic determinants may contain carbohydrate components (3). More recent investigations demonstrated that the CEA are associated with the tumor cell surface (4) and are capable of inducing a tumor-specific antibody response in patients with primary digestive system cancers (5). The objectives of the present investigation were (a) to attempt to purify and to characterize the chemical composition of the CEA found {{in a number of different}} digestive system cancers, (b) to compare the physical and chemical properties of the CEA obtained from different locations in different patients, and (c) to compare the CEA with identical fractions of comparable normal tissues.
