40|$|How {{should the}} law respond when one person (D) kills another person (V), who is black, because D {{believes}} that V {{is about to}} kill him, but D would not have so believed if V had been white?

I argue, however, that denying D 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claim</b> of self-defense would {{be at odds with}} the principle that criminal liability and punishment should only be imposed on an actor if he chooses to cause or risk causing a harm when the law does not permit him to make such a choice, and not for possessing or choosing to possess racist or otherwise illiberal beliefs or desires.

40|$|Obana (2000) and Inoue (1979) {{state that}} professors/doctors receive exalting {{language}} from administrative staff members when {{they refer to}} professors/doctors with people from outside. Similarly, K 2 ̆ 6 emacr;go no Shishin (2007) suggests that administrative staff members in educational/medical institutions can use an honorary title with professors/doctors. Obana 2 ̆ 7 s and Inoue 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claims</b> and K 2 ̆ 6 emacr;go no Shishin 2 ̆ 7 s recommendation is not {{in line with the}} concept of relative honorifics. Considering the fact that Obana 2 ̆ 7 s and Inoue 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claims</b> have yet to be supported by an empirical study, this study attempted to investigate honorific usage in educational and medical institutions in order to 1) test Obana 2 ̆ 7 s and Inoue 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claims,</b> and 2) examine how closely the current usage follows K 2 ̆ 6 emacr;go no Shishin 2 ̆ 7 s recommendation. This questionnaire study found a small number of instances where professors/doctors receive exalting language as well as honorary titles from administrative staff members. Notably males over 40 s in educational organizations used exalting language more frequently {{than the rest of the}} participants. A great majority of the participants in both institutions, however, favored humbling language over exalting language regardless of their organization type, gender, age, experience, and location. This result constitutes evidence against Obana 2 ̆ 7 s and Inoue 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claims.</b> Another finding is that participants who use humbling language still use the honorary titles. This particular honorific usage is interpreted as reflecting the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s ambivalent attitude, but it is in line with the recommendation provided in K 2 ̆ 6 emacr;go no Shishin. ...|$|R

U. <b>S.</b> bank <b>claims</b> on Latin American and Asian emerging markets, and on industrialized countries, are sensitive to U. S. macroeconomic conditions. When the United States grows rapidly, there is substitution between claims on industrialized countries and claims on the United States. The pattern of response of claims on emerging markets to U.

Moreover, we find that, unlike U. <b>S.</b> bank <b>claims</b> on industrialized countries, claims on emerging markets are not highly sensitive to local country GDP and interest rates.

40|$|This Comment {{examines}} {{two ways}} in which the legal system does not adequately consider older women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claims</b> of discrimination. The issues are presented in two conceptual groupings. The first grouping discusses how barriers to the recognition of hybrid age and sex discrimination claims are created when courts do not analyze the evidence of discrimination together as evidence of discrimination against 2 ̆ 2 older women. 2 ̆ 2 Often, courts analyze hybrid claims of age and sex discrimination separately under Title VII and the ADEA, even when the evidence of discrimination points to a hybrid claim involving discrimination directed at a subset of a protected group, such as older women, rather than older employees or women generally. This separate analytical approach restricts a court 2 ̆ 7 s consideration of how the discrimination intersects and can allow employers to defeat older women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claims</b> by showing older men and younger women are treated favorably, though unfavorable treatment of older women exists...|$|R

40|$|How is the {{government}} 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claim</b> for income taxes incurred by a debtor {{in the year of}} bankruptcy treated? Is {{the government}} 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> tax <b>claim</b> entitled to priority as a first priority expense of administration, even though part of the year 2 ̆ 7 s taxes was incurred prepetition? If not, is the claim entitled to eighth priority under its special rule for tax claims? The courts did not reach consistent results on these questions prior to the 2005 Act. The courts agreed that the government 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claim</b> for pre-petition taxes should not be entitled to administrative expense priority, but differed on whether the claim was entitled to eighth priority (and hence excepted from discharge under a special rule) or whether the claim was simply a personal obligation of the debtor that passed through bankruptcy unimpaired rather than a bankruptcy 2 ̆ 2 claim. 2 ̆ 2 This paper exposes the inconsistent legal theories and faulty analysis used by the courts in attempting to achieve rational results from a seriously flawed statutory procedure. The 2005 Bankruptcy Act, which goes into effect for most purposes on October 17, 2005, has eliminated the eighth priority safe habor that many courts relied upon to achieve a rational result. Now, the courts will be forced to decide whether to use faulty reasoning to grant administrative expense priority, whether to use faulty reasoning to avoid treating the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s tax obligation as a bankruptcy 2 ̆ 2 claim, 2 ̆ 2 or whether to recognize that the new rule should properly result in subordinating the government 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>claim</b> to general unsecured status, which would render the claim dischargeable. With nearly two million bankruptcy cases filed each year, nearly all of which involve some year-of-bankruptcy tax liabilities, these are important questions involving large numbers of people and large sums of money. This article should serve as a guide through the complex maze of bankruptcy tax jurisprudence to judges and practitioners attempting to answer these questions.
