To connect a meter, relay or other <b>current</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>device</b> in series with a large current source would be impractical. Current Transformer is a device that {{has been around for}} a long time and will monitor the {{electrical}} power system. The current transformer is measuring device to determine current flow in a power system. For the reliable and correct operation of the protection relays, the current transformer has to be carefully chosen. The distortion of the secondary current of a saturated CT may endanger the operation, selectivity and co-ordination of the protection. This dissertation proposing the selection of a CT, thus enables fast and reliable protection. In this dissertation the calculation of the actual accuracy limit factor (ALF) for protection type (P) current transformer (CT) is described. First the calculation of the Voltage knee point and the burden of the CT, including connection wires and protection relay impedance, are presented. The scope of this calculation involves the cost, value and the safety of protection in power. The CT accuracy primary limit current defines the highest fault current magnitude at which the CT will need the specified accuracy. Beyond this level, the secondary current of the CT will be distorted, and this may cause severe effects on the performance of the protection relay. This dissertation is based on PMU PERLING substation and all the CT data are collected accordingly for calculation purposes.

When the probe system suffers dephasing, this threshold is much lower (and more difficult to attain) than it is for an isolated probe. Further, we find that in realistic situations the maximally entangled probe gives a precision advantage only up to some finite number of probe particles N_cutoff that is lower for a dephasing probe than it is for an isolated probe.

Introduction Current sensors exploiting the Faraday Effect in optical fibers [1] have attracted considerable interest because of their robustness and configurability, thus compatibility with remote sensing. Yet, in conventional optical fibers the minimization of bending losses results in a large sensor size (typically in excess of ~ 10 cm). Moreover, as optical fibers exhibit small responsivities to currents, long lengths of fiber have to be deployed in a single sensor.
