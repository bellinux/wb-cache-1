25|$|In 2005 and 2007, Amtrak {{replaced}} the ties on the bridge, installed <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail,</b> and installed new deck-level maintenance walkways, changes meant {{to extend the}} life of the bridge by 20 to 25 years.|$|R
25|$|Maintenance of {{the line}} was improved, {{inspection}} techniques and jointing methods were revised, and plans for replacing jointed track by <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> were accelerated. Concrete sleepers were banned at rail joints on the Southern Region.|$|R
50|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> is {{generally}} {{used to reduce}} track vibrations and misalignment. Almost all high-speed lines are electrically driven via overhead cables, have in-cab signalling, and use advanced switches using very low entry and frog angles.|$|R

25|$|A {{major problem}} of jointed track is {{cracking}} around the bolt holes, {{which can lead}} to breaking of the rail head (the running surface).

50|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>Welded</b> <b>Rail</b> (CWR) was {{developed}} {{in response to the}} observation that the bulk of track maintenance work takes place at the joints. As steel production and manufacturing processes improved, the rail lengths installed were progressively increased, and the logical extension of this would be to eliminate the joints altogether.|$|R
50|$|Slow {{orders are}} {{employed}} whenever <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> has {{some sort of}} derail or danger condition, such as an open critical joint, joints close to a bridge or movable bridge, or issues with settling ballast. Sometimes slow orders are imposed due to rail geometry defects or due to accumulations of snow.|$|R

50|$|To support trains {{that run}} {{regularly}} at higher speeds, the rails {{need to be}} reliable. Most freight tracks have wooden ties which cause rails to become slightly misaligned over time due to wood rot, splitting and spike-pull (where the spike is gradually loosened from the tie). The concrete ties used to replace them are intended to make the track more stable, particularly with changes in temperature. Rail joints are also an issue, since most conventional rail lines use bolts and fishplates to join two sections of the rail together. This causes the joint to become slightly misaligned over time due to loosening bolts. To make for a smoother ride at higher speeds, the lengths of <b>rail</b> may be <b>welded</b> together to form <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> (CWR). However, the <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> are vulnerable to stress due to changes in temperature.|$|R
50|$|The {{transformation}} was remarkable. An outdated, suburban {{trolley line}} with conventional jointed rail, aging electrical overhead and single track segments was reborn as a wholly double track light <b>rail</b> line with <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> and modern catenary.

50|$|In {{the year}} 2000, the {{government}} of the Republic of Ireland developed a National Development Plan, which has seen major investment in infrastructure. Almost the entire railway network, including the Belfast-Dublin line as far as the border, has been upgraded to <b>Continuous</b> <b>Welded</b> <b>Rail,</b> while signalling is controlled using the Centralised Traffic Control system located at Dublin Connolly station.|$|R
50|$|In 2005 {{the line}} {{received}} around £3 million of investment, which saw around 5 mi of old jointed track replaced with new <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail.</b> Further investment {{was made in}} 2006 to replace around 6 mi of track, leaving just the Chappel viaduct and Lamarsh to Sudbury sections in need of modernisation. This work was completed in 2007.|$|R

25|$|The ballast {{also serves}} as a means of drainage. Some more modern track in special areas is {{attached}} by direct fixation without ballast. Track may be prefabricated or assembled in place. By <b>welding</b> <b>rails</b> together to form lengths of <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rail,</b> additional wear and tear on rolling stock caused by the small surface gap at the joints between rails can be counteracted; this also makes for a quieter ride (passenger trains).|$|R
25|$|As {{a part of}} the Keystone Corridor upgrade {{projects}} {{conducted by}} Amtrak and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, the line was upgraded in 2007 with new concrete ties, <b>continuous</b> <b>welded</b> <b>rails,</b> and overhead lines and substations.

50|$|The new rails usually {{need to be}} {{prepared}} prior to the arrival of track renewal train. Rails are delivered {{to the center of the}} track.
