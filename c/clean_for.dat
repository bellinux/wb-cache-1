5|$|One {{day before}} senior year, Veronica is working {{a job at}} a {{restaurant}}. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his drug test, even though he has been <b>clean</b> <b>for</b> ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although he woke up with a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the gang member, and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their drug test. Wallace informs Veronica about the details of the drug test, and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all the students who were framed in the drug test, and they all say some people might want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested.|$|E

25|$|Partial {{pressure}} blending using pure oxygen decanted {{into the}} cylinder before topping up with air may involve very high oxygen fractions and oxygen partial pressures during the decanting process, which constitute {{a relatively high}} fire hazard. This procedure requires care and precautions by the operator, and decanting equipment and cylinders which are <b>clean</b> <b>for</b> oxygen service, but the equipment is relatively simple and inexpensive. Partial pressure blending using pure oxygen {{is often used to}} provide nitrox on live-aboard dive boats, but it is also used in some dive shops and clubs.|$|E

25|$|Pontifical gloves are liturgical {{ornaments}} {{used primarily}} by the pope, the cardinals, and bishops. They may be worn only at the celebration of mass. The liturgical use of gloves has not been traced beyond {{the beginning of the}} 10th century, and their introduction may have been due to a simple desire to keep the hands <b>clean</b> <b>for</b> the holy mysteries, but others suggest that they were adopted as part of the increasing pomp with which the Carolingian bishops were surrounding themselves. From the Frankish kingdom the custom spread to Rome, where liturgical gloves are first heard of in the earlier half of the 11th century.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} 9th century, Greek texts were written entirely in upper case letters, {{referred}} to as Uncials. During the 9th and 10th centuries, the new lower-case writing hand of Minuscules came gradually to replace the older style. Most Greek Uncial manuscripts were recopied in this period and their parchment leaves typically scraped <b>clean</b> <b>for</b> re-use. Consequently, surviving Greek New Testament manuscripts from before the 9th century are relatively rare; but nine — {{over half of the}} total that survive — witness a more or less pure Alexandrian text. These include the oldest near-complete manuscripts of the New Testament Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209 and Codex Sinaiticus (believed to date from the early 4th century CE).|$|E
25|$|Analysis {{of catch}} returns from 1969 to 1985, {{showed that the}} fish caught most often by anglers were barbel, bream, bleak, carp, chub, dace, eel, gudgeon, perch, and roach. Over the study period the returns {{revealed}} {{that there was a}} variation in the species caught, with a shift from roach and dace based catches, to one of chub and bream, a change that was perceived by anglers to represent a ‘serious detriment’ to the fishery. This led to comments that the river had become ‘too <b>clean</b> <b>for</b> its fish’, and its popularity, especially for match fishing, declined from the mid 1980s. Competition from other fisheries such as well stocked ponds and lakes with better amenities and more consistent catches of fish also meant a reduction in the appeal of fishing the Trent.|$|E

25|$|Cleo Rocos (born 24 July 1962 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) is a comic actress, who {{appeared}} on The Kenny Everett Television Show. Cleo {{has developed a}} maternal role {{in the house and}} tends to look after the younger housemates and do such things as cook and <b>clean</b> <b>for</b> them, which was first pointed out by Ian and Jo on Day 2. On Day 2, Cleo broke Big Brother rules by discussing nominations with Shilpa and Carole. As punishment, the rest of the housemates (except Carole but including Shilpa) were made to vote unanimously on who should face the public vote. Cleo was not chosen. Cleo was a servant during the Master and Servant task. In battle of the tribute bands, she was in Jermaine's group {{as a member of the}} Jackson 5; the group won. She was evicted on Day 24, along with Jo.|$|E
25|$|Bird set {{the fastest}} overall lap {{time in the}} fourth group at one minute and 22.012 seconds, four-tenths of a second faster than the second-placed Heidfeld. Di Grassi set the third quickest lap with Abt and Prost the fourth group's two slowest participants. At the end of group qualifying, the lap times set by Bird, Rosenqvist, Vergne, Heidfeld and di Grassi allowed them to advance into super pole. Rosenqvist {{clinched}} his third pole position {{of the season with}} a time of one minute and 22.344 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row Bird who was two-tenths of a second slower than Rosenqvist and appeared to go fastest by improving on his in the first sector but drifted in turn seven and voiced his disappointment over the radio. Vergne gained {{most of his time in}} the first sector and was <b>clean</b> <b>for</b> the rest of his lap to secure third. Despite complaining about his state of his brakes, Heidfeld took fourth. Di Grassi locked his rear brakes entering the first turn and oversteered through the corner. He was unable to regain any time and could only muster fifth. After qualifying, Prost was demoted twenty places on the starting grid because he changed his battery and inverter following a car bay fire after the first race. However, Prost did not take the full penalty which meant he started from the pit lane and ten seconds were added to his race time.|$|E
25|$|The new McLaren-Honda package {{started out}} to be {{unreliable}} and problematic after a 29 January launch. In the three pre-season tests Button, teammate Alonso and reserve driver Kevin Magnussen only had a single day over one hundred laps, which was completed by Button. Arriving in Australia Button qualified 17th (out of 18) and finished 11th and last in the detuned McLaren to ensure the team and new power unit supplier, Honda Racing F1 would compile decent mileage because of energy recovery issues. This continued into Malaysia where Button had to retire from the race. In China, Button collided with Lotus racer Pastor Maldonado in the latter stages of the Grand Prix. Button received a five-second time penalty dropping him one spot to 14th and two penalty points to his super licence which was previously <b>clean</b> <b>for</b> which the points will last twelve months. Button described the crash as 'just a misjudgement'. Button had a horrible weekend in Sakhir where {{he had to stop}} on track three times, once in FP1, another time in FP2 and again in Q1 where he was unable to set a time and had to line up 20th and last on the grid. After an energy recovery issue Button could not even start the race. In Monaco, he scored his first points of the season, finishing in 8th place. At his home Grand Prix in Great Britain, Button retired on the first lap after contact with his teammate Alonso. At the Hungarian Grand Prix, Button finished in ninth place. Button also finished ninth at Sochi and in the next Grand Prix at Austin he finished an incredible sixth place out of 12 finishing drivers, with his teammate Alonso finishing eleventh.|$|E

500|$|The Way I See It was {{engineered}} by Saadiq, Gerry Brown, James Tanksley, and Brungardt, who mixed the album with Saadiq. Saadiq and Brungardt both liked to layer multiple instruments and, prior to recording, had contemplated {{techniques such as}} sampling and drum programming. However, they ultimately found live instrumentalists more dynamic and challenged themselves to reproduce older music productions and the Motown aesthetic of the 1960s. To familiarize themselves with vintage recording techniques, they studied Mark Lewisohn's 1988 book The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, books about Motown Records, and images of the label's studio personnel, setup of instruments, and microphone placement. They also studied Motown EQs to achieve a tone they found adequate for songs' rhythm guitar parts. Saadiq {{said that he had}} to disregard [...] "about 85 to 90 percent of the new techniques ... People used to take recording very seriously. They used to wear lab coats at Abbey Road. So I got serious with what I was trying to do, both mentally and physically." [...] Brungardt said in an interview for Mix that he abandoned the approach learned on previous records he had engineered, where [...] "they wanted it clean with no distortion. I was taught {{to make sure it was}} polish, polish, polish, and to make sure everything fits right, the bass hits and things are <b>clean</b> <b>for</b> the big pop vocal." ...|$|E
