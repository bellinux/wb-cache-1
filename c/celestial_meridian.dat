25|$|An {{important}} {{influence in}} the development of cartography was the patronage of the Abbasid caliph, al-Ma'mun, who reigned from 813 to 833. He commissioned several geographers to remeasure the distance on earth that corresponds to one degree of <b>celestial</b> <b>meridian.</b> Thus his patronage resulted in the refinement of the definition of the mile used by Arabs (mīl in Arabic) in comparison to the stadion used by Greeks. These efforts also enabled Muslims to calculate the circumference of the earth. Al-Mamun also commanded the production of a large map of the world, which has not survived, though it is known that its map projection type was based on Marinus of Tyre rather than Ptolemy.|$|E
25|$|Langley {{arrived in}} Pittsburgh in 1867 {{to become the}} first {{director}} of the Allegheny Observatory, after the institution had fallen into hard times and been given to the Western University of Pennsylvania. By then, the department was in disarray – equipment was broken, there was no library and the building needed repairs. Through the friendship and aid of William Thaw, a Pittsburgh industrial leader, Langley was able to improve the observatory equipment and build additional apparatuses. One of the new instruments was a small transit telescope used to observe the position of the stars as they cross the <b>celestial</b> <b>meridian.</b> He raised money for the department in large part by distributing standard time to cities and railroads. Up until then, correct time had only occasionally been sent from American observatories for public use. Clocks were manually wound in those days and time tended to be imprecise. Exact time had not been especially necessary. It was enough to know that at noon the sun was directly above the head. All that until railroad tracks were installed.|$|E
25|$|In the box T are two wheels (as in Dr Long's sphere) and two pinions, whose axes {{come out}} at V and U; either {{of which may be}} turned by the small winch W. When the winch is put upon the axis V, and turn backward, the {{terrestrial}} globe, with its horizon and <b>celestial</b> <b>meridian,</b> keep at rest; and the whole sphere of circles turns round from east, by south, to west, carrying the sun Y, and moon Z, round the same way, and causing them to rise above and set below the horizon. But when the winch is put upon the axis U, and turned forward, the sphere with the sun and moon keep at rest; and the earth, with its horizon and meridian, turn round from horizon to the sun and moon, to which these bodies came when the earth kept at rest, and they were carried round it; showing that they rise and set in the same points of the horizon, and at the same times in the hour circle, whether the motion be in the earth or in the heaven. If the earthly globe be turned, the hour-index goes round its hour-circle; but if the sphere be turned, the hour-circle goes round below the index.|$|E

50|$|In astronomy, a {{vertical}} circle {{is a great}} circle on the celestial sphere that is perpendicular to the horizon. Therefore, it passes through the zenith and the nadir.

50|$|In the Northern Hemisphere, {{the winter}} sun (December, January, February) {{rises in the}} southeast, transits the <b>celestial</b> <b>meridian</b> at a low angle in the south (more than 43° above the {{southern}} horizon in the tropics), and then sets in the southwest. It is on the south (equator) {{side of the house}} all day long. A vertical window facing south (equator side) is effective for capturing solar thermal energy. For comparison, the winter sun in the Southern Hemisphere (June, July, August) rises in the northeast, peaks out at a low angle in the north (more than halfway up from the horizon in the tropics), and then sets in the northwest. There, the north-facing window would let in plenty of solar thermal energy to the house.|$|E

5000|$|When the Airy transit circle was built, a mercury basin {{was used}} to align the {{telescope}} to the perpendicular. Thus the circle was aligned with the local vertical or plumb line, which is deflected slightly from the normal, or line perpendicular, to the reference ellipsoid used to define geodetic latitude and longitude in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (which is nearly {{the same as the}} WGS-84 system used by GPS). While the local vertical defined at the Airy transit circle still points to the modern <b>celestial</b> <b>meridian</b> (the intersection of the prime meridian plane with the celestial sphere), it does not pass through the Earth's rotation axis. As a result of this, the ITRF zero meridian, defined by a plane passing through the Earth's rotation axis, is 102 metres to the east of the prime meridian. A 2015 analysis by Malys et al. shows the offset between the Airy transit circle and the ITRF/WGS 84 meridians can be explained by this deflection of the vertical alone; other possible sources of the offset that have been proposed in the past are smaller than the current uncertainty in the deflection of the vertical near the observatory. The astronomical longitude of the Greenwich prime meridian was found to be 0.19&Prime; ± 0.47&Prime; East, i.e. the plane defined by the local vertical on the Greenwich prime meridian and the plane passing through the Earth's rotation axis on the ITRF zero meridian are effectively parallel. However, the claim, found, e.g., in a BBC article that this difference between astronomical and geodetic coordinates means that any measurements of transit time across the IRTF zero meridian will occur 0.352 seconds (or 0.353 sidereal seconds) before the transit across the [...] "intended meridian" [...] is based on a failure of understanding. The explanation by Malys et al. on the other hand is both lucid and correct.|$|E
40|$|A {{great circle}} route (GCR) is the {{shortest}} route on a spherical earth model. Do we have a visual diagram to handle the shortest route? In this paper, a graphical method (GM) is proposed to solve the GCR problems based on the <b>celestial</b> <b>meridian</b> diagram (CMD) in celestial navigation. Unlike developed algebraic methods, the GM is a geometric method. Appling computer software to graph, the GM does not use any equations but is as accurate as using algebraic methods.

40|$|The "Magnificent Seven" (M 7) are a {{group of}} radio-quiet Isolated Neutron Stars (INSs) {{discovered}} in the soft X-rays through their purely thermal surface emission. Owing to the large inferred magnetic fields (B≈ 10 ^ 13 G), radiation from these sources {{is expected to be}} substantially polarised, independently on the mechanism actually responsible for the thermal emission. A large observed polarisation degree is, however, expected only if quantum-electrodynamics (QED) polarisation effects are present in the magnetised vacuum around the star. The detection of a strongly linearly polarised signal would therefore provide the first observational evidence of QED effects in the strong-field regime. While polarisation measurements in the soft X-rays are not feasible yet, optical polarisation measurements are within reach also for quite faint targets, like the M 7 which have optical counterparts with magnitudes ≈ 26 [...] 28. Here, we report on the measurement of optical linear polarisation for the prototype, and brightest member, of the class, RX J 1856. 5 - 3754 (V∼ 25. 5), the first ever for one of the M 7, obtained with the Very Large Telescope. We measured a polarisation degree P. D. = 16. 43 %± 5. 26 % and a polarisation position angle P. A. = 14539 ± 944, computed east of the North <b>Celestial</b> <b>Meridian.</b> The P. D. that we derive is large enough to support the presence of vacuum birefringence, as predicted by QED. Comment: 9 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication on MNRA...|$|E
