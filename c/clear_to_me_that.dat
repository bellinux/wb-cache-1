500|$|Anti-German {{sentiment}} rose {{among the}} British public, in newspapers, and in elite gentlemen's clubs, where resentment was inflamed by Admiral Lord Charles Beresford despite Churchill's remonstrances. Driven by public opinion, Churchill asked Prince Louis to resign as First Sea Lord on 27 October 1914. When acceptance of Battenberg's resignation was delayed by the King's {{opposition to the}} appointment of Fisher in his place, Louis wrote to Churchill, [...] "I beg of you to release me. I am {{on the verge of}} breaking down & I cannot use my brain for anything". On 13 November he wrote to Churchill's Naval Secretary, Rear-Admiral Horace Hood, [...] "It was an awful wrench, but I had no choice from the moment it was made <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the Government did not feel themselves strong enough to support me by some public pronouncement." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} Gipsy Danger's {{artificial}} intelligence system. Del Toro secured permission from Valve Corporation to cast McLain in homage to GLaDOS, her homicidal AI {{character in the}} Portal video games. The director stated: [...] "It was <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> we needed something beautiful in that voice. My daughter is my wingman, we had done co-op on Portal 2 {{for a long time}} and I did Portal 1 when it came out. It becomes ingrained in you, that voice. I didn't want to use her as a negative force of evil. I called Valve and asked 'Can you give us the filter?' so we went full GLaDOS for the first commercial, but I thought it was too much. If you're a gamer, it's too distracting so we created our own GLaDOS 2.0 filter that's a little less full-on." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to bolster series ratings, NBC repositioned reruns of the show to air on its sister network Bravo, during {{the weeks leading up}} to the season one finale on NBC. These episodes aired on a {{schedule}} of one hour every Friday and three hours every Saturday. Bravo is known to have an audience that is upscale and largely female, which is in line with the new strategy of NBC's then-President Kevin Reilly (now at FOX) for selling the show. When questioned about this strategy, he admitted to having regrets about initially marketing the show incorrectly, saying: “It’s been so <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> [...] the show ended up confusing people in terms of what [...] it was supposed to be". He said he felt the show is, at its core, a “women's show”, and his wish is that the marketing had reflected that to a greater extent.|$|E

Over time, it has become <b>clearer</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> on the one hand, the field of MCDA provides a multitude of tools which can indeed address a wide array of problems, but, on the other, there are questions that need to be answered using other tools...|$|R

500|$|Lohan's next {{appearance}} was in Chapter 27 as a John Lennon fan who befriends Mark David Chapman, played by Jared Leto, {{on the day}} he murders Lennon. Filming finished in early 2006, but the film was not released until March 2008 due to difficulties in finding a distributor. In May 2007, the drama Georgia Rule was released. In the film, Lohan portrays an out-of-control teenager whose mother (Felicity Huffman) brings her to the house of her own estranged mother (Jane Fonda). Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Lohan hits a true note of spiteful princess narcissism." [...] During filming in 2006, Lohan was hospitalized, her representative saying [...] "she was overheated and dehydrated." [...] At the time Lohan was going through a breakup with Hard Rock Cafe heir Harry Morton, which contributed to her problems on the set, according to Allure. In a letter that was made public, studio executive James G. Robinson called Lohan [...] "irresponsible and unprofessional." [...] He mentioned [...] "various late arrivals and absences from the set" [...] and said that [...] "we are well aware that your ongoing all night heavy partying is the real reason for your so-called 'exhaustion.'" [...] In 2007, Lohan was cast in the film Poor Things. But in May of that year, she was arrested on a charge of driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} (DUI.) The film's producers initially voiced support, and production was put on hold, as Lohan entered the Promises Treatment Center rehabilitation facility where she stayed for 45 days. She ultimately lost the Poor Things part. In July, less than two weeks out of rehab, Lohan was arrested a second time on charges of possession of cocaine, driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license. In August, Lohan pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cocaine use and driving under the influence and was sentenced to an alcohol education program, community service, one day in jail, and was given three years probation. Lohan released a statement in which she said [...] "it is <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> my life has become completely unmanageable because I am addicted to alcohol and drugs." [...] The same month she entered the Cirque Lodge Treatment Center in Sundance, Utah for a third stint at rehabilitation, staying for three months until her discharge in October. In November Lohan served 84 minutes in jail. A sheriff spokesman cited overcrowding and the nonviolent nature of the crime as reasons for the reduced sentence.|$|E

Fifteen years ago I made {{a documentary}} about migrant Mexican men working in Canada called El Contrato. It was the first feature documentary I’d ever made.

2500|$|RC's {{system of}} {{centralised}} control has been deprecated by ex-members {{who would have}} preferred a more accountable leadership. John Heron, once an RC leader and teacher, who left the organization in 1974 to set up his own co-counseling organization, Co-Counselling International, said he parted company with RC because it [...] "systematically conditioned its members to associate {{a certain kind of}} beneficial human development with centralized authoritarian control of theory and community policy. It was <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> this was pseudo-liberation." [...] He considered that the authoritarianism of RC derived partly from the Leninist doctrines of central control that Jackins had learned in the Communist Party of America and partly from the autocratic example of his former associate L.

"In 1946, after {{returning}} to Montreal from service with the Free French Forces, it was <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the crude technique previously used for radioautography had to be improved". In collaboration with Leonard Bélanger, Leblond worked on increasing {{the resolution of the}} autoradiographic technique. They were advised by physicist Pierre Demers to melt the emulsion from Eastman Kodak lantern slides, paint it directly on the sections, and then develop the emulsion while it was still attached to the histologic sections. This resulted in a tenfold improvement in resolution. Subsequently, Leblond and his colleagues developed a technique in which the histologic slides were dipped directly into liquid emulsion. The use of thinner sections and emulsion coats led to further advances in resolution, and the introduction of tritium was a technical milestone.|$|E
2500|$|According to Grist, it was Georgia that {{launched}} the first military strikes against Tskhinvali. [...] "It was <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the [...] attack was completely indiscriminate and disproportionate to any, if indeed {{there had been}} any, provocation,” he said. “The attack was clearly, in my mind, an indiscriminate attack on the town, as a town.” Grist's views were echoed by Stephen Young, who was another senior OSCE official in Georgia at the time. According to him, {{there had been no}} extensive shelling of the Georgian villages on the evening or night of August 7. Young added, that if there had been shelling of Georgian villages that evening, the OSCE monitors at the scene would have heard it. According to him, the monitors only heard occasional small arms fire.|$|E
