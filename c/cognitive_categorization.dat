50|$|The other notion {{related to}} prototypes {{is that of}} a basic level in <b>cognitive</b> <b>categorization.</b> When asked What are you sitting on?, most {{subjects}} prefer to say chair rather than a subordinate such as kitchen chair or a superordinate such as furniture. Basic categories are relatively homogeneous in terms of sensory-motor affordances — a chair is associated with bending of one's knees, a fruit with picking it up and putting it in your mouth, etc. At the subordinate level (e.g. chairs, chairs etc.) hardly any significant features can be added to that of the basic level; whereas at the superordinate level, these conceptual similarities are hard to pinpoint. A picture of a chair is easy to draw (or visualize), but drawing furniture would be difficult.|$|E
50|$|Dovidio and Gaertner {{introduced}} three psychological {{supports for}} aversive racism. As humans, people are predisposed to <b>cognitive</b> <b>categorization.</b> By categorizing people into different groups, {{it allows us}} to see the differences that exist between other groups compared to the groups we've put ourselves in. By recognizing these differences, we are then motivated to control our environment around us when we interact with outgroups. This motivation is desirable because we want our interactions to be positive, especially when interacting with minorities. The most influential psychological support is the socialization of two sets of incompatible values. Americans, as children, are brought up being taught to have an egalitarian belief system. They want justice and equality for all minorities. They are also taught about the racial traditions that symbolize American history. These two sets of incompatible values conflict with one another, resulting in inconsistent behavior towards members of outgroups. They feel the internal negative affect based on these two sets of values and it comes out in their behaviors and attitudes on other people.|$|E

40|$|Given that {{knowledge}} consists of finite models of an infinitely complex reality, {{how can we}} explain {{that it is still}} most of the time reliable? Survival in a variable environment requires an internal model whose complexity (variety) matches the complexity of the environment that is to be controlled. The reduction of the infinite complexity of the sensed environment to a finite map requires a strong mechanism of categorization. A measure of cognitive complexity (C) is defined, which quantifies the average amount of trial-and-error needed to find the adequate category. C can be minimized by "probability ordering" of the possible categories, where the most probable alternatives ("defaults") are explored first. The reduction of complexity by such ordering requires a low statistical entropy for the cognized environment. This entropy is automatically kept down by the natural selection of "fit" configurations. The high probability, "default" <b>cognitive</b> <b>categorizations</b> are then merely mappings of environmentally "fit" configurations...|$|R

40|$|The GEOCAT {{is a short}} {{nonverbal test}} for {{measuring}} two types of cognition that tally with Freud’s distinction between primary and secondary unconscious processes: attributional and relational similarity judgment. Attributional similarity judgment is a mode of <b>cognitive</b> <b>categorization</b> in which stimuli are classified based on perceptual resemblances between attributes and features, just like in primary processing. Relational similarity judgment is a mode of <b>cognitive</b> <b>categorization</b> that builds on higher order relationships between stimuli, just like in secondary processing. The GEOCAT {{can be used in}} diverse research contexts, and test administration takes 2 minutes. The present study investigates the construct validity and internal consistency of this instrument in a sample of Belgian university students. A confirmatory factor analysis for binary items indicates that a dimension reflecting relational or attributional categorization processes lies behind the GEOCAT items, that this model has a good fit to the data, and that all items are equally good indicators of these processes. We also compared the GEOCAT to an alternative measure that builds on a continuous scale for similarity judgment. Correlations between corresponding subscales were moderate and three GEOCAT items proved to be problematic. Internal consistency proved to be good. Suggestions for future research on similarity judgment and primary and secondary processes are discussed. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Many {{languages}} {{of the world}} have connectives to express causal relations at the discourse level.

Such choices provide a window on speakers' <b>cognitive</b> <b>categorizations,</b> and have been modeled in previous work in terms of subjectivity. However, a broader empirical basis and a more specific operationalization of subjectivity are urgently needed. This paper provides in these needs by developing an integrative empirical approach to the analysis of the Dutch connectives omdat ‘because’ and want ‘since/for’ in written text, conversation, and chat interactions. These can be considered a case in point for linguistic categorization since related European languages show similar distinctions. The construct of subjectivity is decomposed into characteristics like type of relation and subject of consciousness (who can be considered responsible for the causality?). The use of statistical methods specifically suitable for hypothesis testing in natural language corpora produces results that provide new insights into the division of labor between the two connectives, as well as into the notion of subjectivity...|$|R
40|$|This work {{analyzes}} {{and models}} {{the nature and}} dynamics of organizational memory, as such an essential ingredient of organizational capabilities that determine strategic choices in different competitive environments. There are two sides to it, namely a cognitive side, involving the beliefs and interpretative frameworks by which the organization categorizes {{the states of the}} world and its own internal states, and an operational one, including routines and procedures that store the knowledge of how to do things. We formalize both types of memory by means of evolving systems of condition-action rules and investigate their performance in different environments characterized by varying degrees of complexity and non-stationarity. Broadly speaking, in simple and stable environments memory does not matter, provided it satisfies some minimal requirements. In more complex and gradually changing ones, having more memory provides an advantage. However, there is some critical level of environmental instability above which forgetfulness is evolutionary superior {{from the point of view}} of long-term performance. Moreover, above some (modest) complexity threshold, stable and robust <b>cognitive</b> <b>categorizations</b> and routinized behaviour emerge...|$|R

40|$|Research has {{uncovered}} that positive affect broadens <b>cognitive</b> <b>categorization.</b> The motivational dimen-sional model, however, posits that positive affect {{is not a}} unitary construct with only one cognitive consequence. Instead, this model puts forth that there are different positive affects varying in approach motivational intensity. According to this model, only positive affects lower in motivational intensity should broaden cognitive processes, whereas positive affects higher in motivational intensity should narrow cognitive processes. Consistent with these predictions, high approach positive affect {{has been shown to}} narrow attention, whereas low approach positive affect has been shown to broaden it (Gable & Harmon-Jones, 2008). High approach positive affect, therefore, might narrow categorization. Two experiments investigated this possibility by having participants respond to <b>cognitive</b> <b>categorization</b> tasks in 3 body postures designed to elicit different levels of approach motivation: reclining backward, which should evoke low approach motivation; sitting upright, which should evoke moderate approach moti-vation; and leaning forward, which should evoke high approach motivation. Participants smiled while in each posture in order to experience positive affect. Experiment 1 provided initial support for the idea that high approach positive affect narrows categorization and low approach positive affect broadens catego-rization. Experiment 2 replicated these findings with improved smiling instructions. These results extend previous work by showing that the motivational model’s predictions hold for basic attentional processes as well as higher level cognitive processes such as categorization...|$|E

Such choices provide a window on speakers' <b>cognitive</b> <b>categorizations,</b> and have been modeled in previous work in terms of subjectivity. This paper analyzes the Dutch connectives omdat (‘because’) and want (‘since/for’) in written text, conversation, and chat interactions.

We conclude that deviations should be interpreted in terms of core elements of the prototypical use. Therefore, the semantic-pragmatic profile of want and omdat should not be considered as hard-wired all-or-nothing rules, but rather as a prototype structure with a core meaning/use and more peripheral uses. The non-prototypical, peripheral uses are motivated deviations: we need the elements in the core profile to understand the deviations...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{analyzes}} various {{prejudices and}} stereotypes in Ghanaian {{national and local}} policies, discourses and practices that have contributed to exclusion of Fulani pastoralists {{in terms of their}} access to resources, land, belonging and settlements in local communities. National and local discourses have regarded Fulani pastoralists including those of second- and third-generation as migrants and non-citizens. Besides, the paper shows that these prejudices, stereotypes and practices of exclusion have affected and structured relations between the pastoralists and local people, especially farmers. There are less chances of pastoralists’ cooperation with local people, as well as Fulani integration into society; rather, these attitudes contribute to an escalation of violence in cases of conflict. Whilst we refuse to generalize that all people in Ghana hold these views against the Fulani, there are clear indicators that in local attitudes, discourses and policies, media reports and government action have overtly and covertly excluded and marginalized Fulani. These are mainly seen in national expulsion exercises, local community evictions and lack of access and rights to resource uses in the community. National and local polices and discourses on Fulani pastoralists need rethinking. Fulani are not homogeneous, and each individual Fulani engaged in crime or bad behaviour does not need to represent social categorizations that blame the Fulani as a whole group. Ghanaian media discourse is a major force that contributes to the social and <b>cognitive</b> <b>categorizations</b> of Fulani.|$|R
