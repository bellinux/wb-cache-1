40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to explore}} the knowledge high school guidance <b>counselors</b> <b>in</b> Missouri have as they work with undocumented students who are trying to gain access to college. Utilizing the tools of case study including document analysis, focus groups, interviews, and observations, this study attempts to gain a thorough understanding about what high school guidance <b>counselors</b> <b>in</b> Missouri know and what they do not know about assisting undocumented students seeking access to college and other post-secondary opportunities. The {{participants in this study were}} high school guidance <b>counselors</b> <b>in</b> a mid-sized urban/suburban school district. Because Missouri is not a DREAM act state, these high school guidance counselors face barriers when assisting undocumented students. The study indicates high school guidance <b>counselors</b> <b>in</b> Missouri lack awareness about undocumented students, lack knowledge about laws, practices, and programs concerning undocumented students, and need training about how to best serve undocumented students who are applying for post-secondary educational opportunities...|$|R
