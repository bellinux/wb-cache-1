How to design project organization structure in design team in order to improve design coordination performance is concerned. Structural contingency theory argues that there is no best organization structure. The effect of organization structure on performance depends on task uncertainty. However, organization structure does not react sensitively to contingency change. But project organization structure, as a temporary organization structure is much easier to be adjusted. Coordination is an information processing activity to deal with task uncertainty. It is postulated that project organization structure affect project performance by facilitating or prohibiting information processing to reduce task uncertainty. Incorporating structure-conduct-performance perspective into traditional structural contingency theory, an advanced structural contingency framework is developed to investigate the relationship between project organization structure and project performance. It is postulated that, when task uncertainty changes its level, performance restores by organization structure-conduct adapting to fit new information processing requirement. A case study is conducted to test the framework. The advanced framework helps to understand how project organization structure affects project performance from a more systematical and process view. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Singapor...|$|R

The influence caused by the change order’s work could degrade the time performance to 5. 942 percent. If the change order did not happen, then the time performance would increase about 2. 666 percent from the previous planned time. This increase happened because of tolerance time made during the project planning, so that the decline of time performance occurred was not too big.

40|$|Purpose This study {{seeks to}} address {{contemporary}} issues in stakeholder influence in long-term projects with multiple actors. These projects are complex {{in nature and}} value outcomes are established along the way. This value co-creation process requires input from all stakeholders, ranging from low to high status. Many of the low status stakeholders find themselves {{on the outside of}} the decision making process and use digital platforms to bolster their engagement. We analyse the journey of stakeholder co-creation by categorising the process and identifying the periods in which high status stakeholders ‘get noisy’ and digital platforms for the empowerment of low status stakeholder contribute the most. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts an exploratory methodology and the design orchestrates case study-based qualitative interviews. We conduct two research stages, firstly defining key concepts associated with the project process through the application of the Delphi technique. Respondents from the different stakeholder groups are asked a series of questions to identify clear definitions of these concepts and these are revisited in subsequent interviews having shared the definitions from the first round of interviews. The second phase is the creation of the phases of the project, based on the identification of milestones that generate agreed points of value co-creation. Findings The study is in progress and early indications show a three phase process, (1) building, (2) using and (3) destroying. At this stage of the study, fine-grained analysis reveals further sub-processes that are so critical to understand when making true value co-creation happen. Furthermore, we find that digital empowerment takes place through online engagement platforms. These platforms are typically set up by the high-powered stakeholders including but not limited to construction firms, architect and central planning authorities. This is modelled on standard development projects and is extended here to specific targeted low powered stakeholders who are already involved from the conceptualisation phase. Research limitations/implications (if applicable) This research is exploratory and so lacks generalizability at this stage. Further research would seek to extend our work through an empirical analysis of a wider sample of projects, both domestically and internationally. Empirical testing of the conceptualisations will also refine these categories improving the prospects for generalised truths about the process of digital empowerment in complex projects. Originality/value This study evaluates a novel area in the value co-creation literature and extends the static dyadic perspective to develop a dynamic view of the co-creation process. This process involves multiple actors at different <b>project</b> <b>stages.</b> The extant literature does not examine the role of digital platforms in this context to any significant extent. Yet, throughout the <b>construction</b> <b>project</b> <b>stages,</b> stakeholder groups are digitally connected. This insight into the on-going process of value co-creation is revealed through the changing nature of the interactions between stakeholders as the project moves through different stages. Looked at value co-creation in an online/offline and dynamic fashion, our study will contribute to theory building that is urgently needed for the ‘value co-creation research area’ to advance...|$|R

One such example is the Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology. BIM is an advanced technology that provides reasonable scientific solutions for <b>construction</b> <b>projects.</b> By applying digital information in all the <b>project</b> <b>stages,</b> such as design, construction, and operation, BIM simulates the physical <b>construction</b> of the <b>project,</b> detects the problems that may arise during the construction phase in the early design phase, and provides solutions accordingly. BIM technology has been widely applied in Europe, the USA, and Japan and has also been adopted by projects in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. BIM is the future of intelligent construction of urban rail transit projects.|$|R
