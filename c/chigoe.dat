5|$|Fleas are vectors for viral, {{bacterial}} and rickettsial {{diseases of}} humans and other animals, {{as well as of}} protozoan and helminth parasites. Bacterial diseases carried by fleas include murine or endemic typhus. and bubonic plague. Fleas can transmit Rickettsia typhi, Rickettsia felis, and Bartonella henselae, and the myxomatosis virus. They can carry Hymenolepiasis tapeworms and Trypanosome protozoans. The <b>chigoe</b> flea or jigger (Tunga penetrans) causes the disease tungiasis, a major public health problem around the world. Fleas that specialize as parasites on specific mammals may use other mammals as hosts; thus, humans may be bitten by cat and dog fleas.|$|E

50|$|If {{the patient}} is not vaccinated, tetanus is often a {{complication}} due to secondary infection. Gangrene is another common complication of severe infestation and superinfection. Staphylococcus aureus and Wolbachia endobacteria can be transmitted by the <b>chigoe</b> flea, as well as nearly 150 other different pathogens. For these reasons, the <b>chigoe</b> flea should be removed as soon as possible.|$|E
5000|$|Tungiasis is {{strictly}} caused by <b>chigoe</b> fleas (the term transmission {{does not apply}} because Tunga penetrans is itself responsible for the disease.) The preponderance of tungiasis lesions on the toes may be because <b>chigoe</b> flea is a poor jumper, attaining only a high of 20 cm. But the reality is more complex; for example, the jumping ability cannot explain why hands are the second-most affected body part. Lesions on the hands are better explained by playing {{in the sand and}} noting that hands are often used to remove sand {{from other parts of the}} body. The occurrence of tungiasis lesions on the toes, between them, and on the soles can be easily explained because most of the victims are poor, walk barefoot, and live in places where the sand (home to <b>chigoe</b> fleas) constitutes the floor. Rate of incidence therefore is greatly increased in poor communities and populations because of the lack of adequate housing. [...] This occurs in significantly higher proportions during the peak of the dry season in local communities.|$|E

5000|$|Chigs (sometimes {{referred}} to as Glyphs) are a fictional alien species in the science fiction television series Space: Above and Beyond. Chig is not the species' name for itself, but rather a human-coined nickname (referencing the <b>chigoe</b> flea).|$|E
50|$|For {{the most}} part, the <b>chigoe</b> flea lives 2-5 cm below sand, an {{observation}} which helps explain its overall distribution. The temperature is generally {{too hot for}} the larvae to develop {{on the surface of}} the sand and the deeper sand does not have enough oxygen.|$|E
50|$|Stage 1 is {{characterized}} by the penetration of the skin by the female <b>chigoe</b> flea. Running along the body, the female uses its posterior legs to push its body upward by an angle between 45-90 degrees. Penetration then starts, beginning with the proboscis going through the epidermis.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{vaccines}} {{would be}} useful, {{due to the}} ectoparasitic nature of <b>chigoe</b> flea, they are neither a feasible nor an effective tool against tungiasis. Nevertheless, due to {{the high incidence of}} secondary infection, those at risk of tungiasis should get vaccinated against tetanus. A better approach is to use repellents that specifically target the <b>chigoe</b> flea. One very successful repellent is called Zanzarin, a derivative of coconut oil, jojoba oil, and aloe vera. In a recent study involving two cohorts, the infestation rates dropped 92% on average for the first one and 90% for the other. Likewise, the intensity of the cohorts dropped by 86% and 87% respectively. The non-toxic nature of Zanzarin, combined with its [...] "remarkable regression of the clinical pathology" [...] make this a tenable public health tool against tungiasis.|$|E

50|$|In a {{study of}} 1000 freshly ejected T. penetrans eggs, {{it was found that}} females are {{generally}} smaller than males for all criteria. In some cases, though, females had a bigger epipharynx and maxillar palpus. Due to its burrowing activity, the <b>chigoe</b> flea has developed a well-developed lacinia and epipharynx that is used to penetrate the skin. Overall, the fleas’ head is relatively flattened, which again aids in burrowing through the epidermal and dermal layers.|$|E
50|$|Acting as both {{biological}} vectors and definitive hosts, {{humans have}} spread Tunga penetrans from its isolated {{existence in the}} West Indies to all of Latin America and most of Africa via sea travel. Since the <b>chigoe</b> flea technically has no reservoir species and the female will cause tungiasis to any mammalian organism it can penetrate, this means the flea will have a relatively large number of hosts and victims. Epidemiologically, {{this is important as}} tungiasis often causes secondary infections.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chigoe</b> flea eggs’ {{average length}} is 604 μm and the just hatched larvae, {{in their first}} instar, have an average length of 1,500 μm.

5000|$|Tungiasis (also {{known as}} nigua, pio and bicho de pie, or pique or sand flea disease) is an {{inflammatory}} skin disease caused by infection {{with the female}} ectoparasitic Tunga penetrans (also known as <b>chigoe</b> flea, jigger, nigua or sand flea), found in the tropical parts of Africa, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and India. Tunga penetrans is the smallest flea in the world, measuring 1 mm across. It is also known in Latin America as the nigua and bicho de pie (Spanish) or bicho de pé (Portuguese), literally [...] "foot bug".

50|$|Tungiasis {{had been}} endemic in pre-Columbian Andean society for centuries before {{discovery}} of T. penetrans as {{native to the}} West Indies. The first case of tungiasis was described in 1526 by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés, where he discussed the skin infection and its symptoms on crew members from Columbus’s Santa Maria after they were shipwrecked on Haiti. Through ship routes and further expeditions, the <b>chigoe</b> flea was spread {{to the rest of}} the world, particularly to the rest of Latin America and Africa.

50|$|Trombicula {{species of}} mites are {{sometimes}} known, {{when in the}} larval stage, as berry bug, harvest mites, or chiggers (but {{not to be confused}} with jigger or <b>chigoe</b> flea). They feed on blood, but only in the larval stage. The lifecycle starts with eggs laid in the environment of the normal hosts of the larvae, typically rodents and other small mammals. Larvae quest for hosts whilst on vegetation in the same way in which many larval ticks do. After the engorged larva has completed feeding, it detaches from its stylostome feeding tube, drops to the ground, and molts to a nymph. The remaining lifecycle comprises the free-living nymph and adult stages predatory on other minute arthropods. The adults resemble spiders. They actively hunt amongst the ground-level debris layer of vegetation and are conspicuous by their red color and dense outer covering of fine setae, appearing like fur.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{patterns of}} infestation with Tunga penetrans (L., 1758) within the poor community of Araruama municipality, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, {{assessed by the}} number of persons and domestic animals parasitized. The overall prevalence of infestation was 49. 2 % (211 parasitized hosts) of the 429 examined. Humans (p < 0. 01) and dogs (p < 0. 01) were the most important hosts with 62. 6 % and 35. 6 % respectively. Dogs were considered as the potential infestation source to humans. Considering sex and age groups, both measures showed a significant difference (p < 0. 01) : female (62. 2 % infested of 143 examined) and male (43. 9 % infested of 98 examined). All age classes were found infested with significant difference (G = 42. 5; p < 0. 01) and most of the infestation occurred in children in the 0 - 9 -year old category (27. 3 %). In contrast and based on mean of <b>chigoe</b> burden per person, the parasitic intensity was significantly higher on male than on female in all age categories, except for the 50 + (H = 27. 1; p < 0. 01) and decreasing with the increase of age (chi 2 = 69. 7, A = - 124. 6, p < 0. 01).
