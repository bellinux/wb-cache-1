50|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>application</b> to {{the skin}} (cryotherapy) is used to {{decrease}} pain and inflammation of acute soft tissue injuries. At a cellular level, <b>cold</b> <b>application</b> decreases the formation of exudate and diapedesis of inflammatory cells, thereby reducing edema. Cryotherapy {{has also been shown}} to reduce metabolism and thus oxygen demand of tissues, helping to prevent hypoxic tissue damage. Cold is often applied to the site of injury by hosing cold water onto the area (hydrotherapy), icing, or medical devices such as the Game Ready system that provides both cold therapy and compression. Cold salt-water spas are also available, and are used to bathe a patient’s injury in aerated, hypertonic, cold water. This combines the benefits of cryotherapy with the osmotic effect of salt, producing better analgesia and reduction of inflammation.|$|E

50|$|An {{ice pack}} is placed over an injured area and is {{intended}} to absorb heat of a closed traumatic or edematous injury by using conduction to transfer thermal energy. The physiologic effects of <b>cold</b> <b>application</b> include immediate vasoconstriction with reflexive vasodilation, decreased local metabolism and enzymatic activity, and decreased oxygen demand. Cold decreases muscle spindle fiber activity and slows nerve conduction velocity, therefore it {{is often used to}} decrease spasticity and muscle guarding. It is commonly used to alleviate the pain of minor injuries, as well as decrease muscle soreness. The use of ice packs in treatment decreases the blood flow most rapidly {{at the beginning of the}} cooling period, this occurs as a result of vasoconstriction, the initial reflex sympathetic activity.|$|E

50|$|Caregivers {{may provide}} nonpharmacological {{treatment}} {{for children and}} adolescents because it carries minimal risk and is cost effective compared to pharmacological treatment. Nonpharmacologic interventions vary by age and developmental factors. Physical interventions to ease pain in infants include swaddling, rocking, or sucrose via a pacifier, whereas those for children and adolescents include hot or <b>cold</b> <b>application,</b> massage, or acupuncture. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) aims to reduce the emotional distress and improve the daily functioning of school-aged children and adolescents with pain through focus on changing the relationship between their thoughts and emotions in addition to teaching them adaptive coping strategies.

Current treatment strategies for reducing CTR-associated pain and anxiety are limited and partially efficacious. To determine the effects of <b>cold</b> <b>application,</b> inhalation of lavender essential oil, and their combination on pain and anxiety during CTR was investigated. This randomized controlled open-label trial was conducted with 80 p atients in the cardiac surgery intensive care unit who had a chest tube for duration of at least 24 hours after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients were randomized (n= 20 in each group) to receive <b>cold</b> <b>application,</b> aromatherapy with lavender oil, <b>cold</b> <b>application</b> in combination with lavender oil inhalation, or none of the above interventions (control group). The intensity and quality of pain and anxiety were evaluated using the visual analogue scale, short form and modified-McGill pain questionnaire (SFM-MPQ) and the Spielberger situational anxiety level inventory (STAII) scale, respectively.

40|$|Background: Healthy individuals, to {{ease and}} {{accomplish}} their {{activities of daily}} living they need flexible body without any tightness in the muscles, particularly those used for a definite function. Cooling soft tissues in a lengthened position after stretching has been shown to promote more lasting increases in soft tissue length and minimize post stretch muscle soreness. There are less documented studies which compared modified proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretch over passive manual stretch with <b>cold</b> <b>application</b> commonly after the interventions. Methods: Thirty high school going healthy students were divided into two groups- Group I received Passive Manual stretching (n= 15) and Group II received modified PNF stretching (n= 15) and both groups received <b>cold</b> <b>application</b> after the interventions for 10 minutes commonly for 5 days.

40|$|To {{assess the}} level of {{anesthesia}} in three different intravenous anesthetics (thiamylal, ketamine,Alphadione?), the amplitude of the plethysmograph, EEG analysis and forearm skin and subcutaneous temperature were measured in 96 healthy men under three different conditions (spontaneous, during painful stimulation or with <b>cold</b> <b>application</b> on one forearm). Thiamylal, 4, 6 mg/kg and Alphadione?, 75, 100 μl/kg, produced increases in the amplitude of the plethysmograph in a dose-related manner, but ketamine did not. The increases in amplitude and the cessation of drift following the above two agents were terminated by painful stimulation before regaining of consciousness. Under the condition of <b>cold</b> <b>application</b> on the forearm, thiamylal and Alphadione? increased the amplitude in only the forearm with the <b>cold</b> <b>application.</b> Among intermittent intravenous administrations of the drugs, only Alphadione? 75 μl/kg increased the amplitude of the phethysmograph in all cases studied. In EEG bandpass filter analysis, the values of σ 1 +θ were {{closely related to the}} depth of anesthesia with thiamylal, 4 or 6 mg/kg, but not to those with Alphadione? and ketamine. Although the skin and subcutaneous temperature of the forearm rose after the administration of thiamylal 6 mg/kg, they did not with the <b>cold</b> <b>application</b> to the forearm. Alphadione? 75 or 100 μl/kg caused a slight rise in both temperatures under both conditions. These results suggest that the amplitude of the plethysmograph could be a useful guide in diagnosing {{the level of}} anesthesia with thiamylal and Alphadione?. The value of σ 1 +θ using EEG bandpass filter analysis were also valid for thiamylal anesthesia, but because of slow and small changes in forearm skin and subcutanesus temperatures after intravenous anesthetic injection, these temperatures changes were difficult to use as a guide to the depth of anesthesia...|$|E
40|$|Background and aim: Cryotherapy {{has long}} been {{introduced}} as a common method for preventing and reducing edema caused by traumatic injuries. Many {{studies have been conducted}} regarding other effects of cold such as its effects on muscle strength which provided controversial results over the past decades. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether cold is capable of changing the muscle strength. Materials and methods: The research was conducted on 30 volunteers with the mean age of 22 years. In a standard situation, the volunteers were asked to make their maximum grip force. Cold was applied over their anterior forearm using an ice pack for 15 minutes. The maximum grip force was measured before and within 1 to 120 minutes after <b>cold</b> <b>application.</b> Results:The strength of the anterior forearm muscles decreased rapidly after <b>cold</b> <b>application.</b> The maximum reduction of muscle strength, in average 18 % was observed after 10 minutes. This was followed by a gradual increase of grip force. After 120 minutes the force was increased to about 5 % above the baseline force that was before <b>cold</b> <b>application.</b> Conclusion: Regarding the slight increase in the muscle strength and its long delay, cryotherapy of muscles cannot be considered as a practical method in rehabilitation of patients.

40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>application</b> is {{commonly}} used before strenuous exercise due to its hypalgesic effects. Some have questioned this procedure because of reports that cold may reduce isokinetic torque. However, {{there have been no}} investigations of actual physical performance following <b>cold</b> <b>application.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if a 20 -minute ice immersion treatment to the foot and ankle affected the performance of three agility tests: the carioca maneuver, the cocontraction test, and the shuttle run. Twenty-four male athletic subjects were tested during two different treatment sessions following an orientation session. Subjects were tested following a 20 -minute 1 °C ice immersion treatment to the dominant foot and ankle and 20 minutes of rest. Following each treatment, subjects performed three trials of each agility test, with 30 seconds rest between each trial, and 1 minute between each different agility test. The order in which each subject performed the agility tests was determined by a balanced Latin square. A MANOVA with repeated measures was used to determine if there was an overall significant difference in the agility times recorded between the cold and control treatments and if the order of the treatment sessions affected the scores. Although the mean agility time scores were slightly slower following the cold treatment, cooling the foot and ankle caused no difference in agility times. Also, there was no difference resulting from the treatment orders. We felt that the slightly slower scores may have been a result of tissue stiffness and/or subject's apprehension immediately following the cold treatment. <b>Cold</b> <b>application</b> to the foot and ankle can be used before strenuous exercise without altering agility...|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Clinical SciencesJames RoushObjective – To {{measure the}} effect of cold and warm {{compress}} therapy on tissue temperature in healthy dogs. Design – Controlled, blinded, crossover study Animals – 10 healthy mixed breed dogs Procedures – Dogs were sedated with hydromorphone 0. 1 mg/kg IV and diazepam 0. 25 mg/kg IV. Thermocouple needles were inserted to 0. 5 cm (superficial), 1. 0 cm (mid) and 1. 5 cm (deep) into a shaved, lumbar, epaxial region to measure tissue temperature. Cold 2 ° F (- 16. 8 ° C) and warm 117 °F (47 °C) compresses were applied with gravity dependence for periods of 5, 10 and 20 minutes. Control data was collected under identical sedation. Results – Mean temperature significantly decreased after 5 minutes of <b>cold</b> <b>application</b> at only the superficial depth. Application of cold for 10 and 20 minutes significantly reduced the temperature at all depths. Twenty minutes of <b>cold</b> <b>application</b> significantly decreased temperature at only the mid depth compared to 10 minutes of application.
