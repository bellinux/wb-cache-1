40|$|Abstract: Local {{avalanche}} breakdowns {{take place}} in the neighbourhood of PN junction local defects at sufficiently high reverse voltage. These breakdowns give rise to microplasma noise which is often characterized by <b>current</b> <b>impulses</b> whose inception <b>time</b> and duration time are random. The effective cross-section of the microplasma region being rather small, the current density may achieve a high value, which in turn can result in local heating of the micro-region and, consequently, the junction destruction. The present paper deals with the effect of the temperature on statistical characterics of microplasma noise. This effect is intended to be used for the local defect temperature determination based on these characteristic measurement results...|$|R

30|$|For {{impulsive}} differential systems, {{most researchers}} concern about {{two kinds of}} impulse times: fixed <b>impulse</b> <b>times</b> and varying <b>impulse</b> <b>times,</b> which mean that the <b>impulse</b> <b>time</b> is some functions of the ‘state x’ [7 – 9]. However, the impulse phenomena sometimes happen at random times, and any solution of systems driven by this kind of impulses is a stochastic process, which {{is very different from}} those of differential systems with impulses at fixed moments and varying <b>impulse</b> <b>times</b> [11]. Thus, the randomness introduced in impulsive differential systems by this way has brought us new difficulties and problems in the study of impulsive differential systems. Some other kinds of randomness brought to a system can be seen in [16 – 18].|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this report details the background to surge arresters and surge protective device components, viz., spark gaps, gas discharge tubes and metal oxide varistors. Current surge protective device technologies are detailed for several of the larger surge protective device manufacturers worldwide. Tests were performed using both 8 / 20 μs and 10 / 350 μs <b>current</b> <b>impulses</b> to verify the voltage and current response of gas discharge tubes with or without series MOVs and triggering circuits. Measurements obtained from the test setup were compared against each other, sharing a total <b>impulse</b> <b>current</b> of 35. 8 kA peak using an 8 / 20 μs waveform and 10. 2 kA peak using a 10 / 350 μs <b>current</b> <b>impulse</b> waveform. In the work presented, it is shown that series varistors dampened any voltage and current oscillatory behaviour superimposed from the <b>current</b> <b>impulse</b> generator due to their voltage clamping properties, which similarly do not allow any follow current to flow after a surge has subsided. No effect was seen by using a single varistor or a many parallel mounted varistors in series with a gas discharge tube. By using three electrode gas discharge tubes with a triggering circuit, the clamping voltage was reduced, as the gas tubes reacted faster than an equivalent circuit without a triggering module, which {{has the advantage of}} reducing the protection level for the protected equipment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – A {{floating}} electrode is an insulated metallic {{body that}} is immersed in a background electrostatic field. This floating electrode can be electrically charged by corona discharges. The gathered charge on a floating electrode surface {{can be used to}} generate a fast <b>current</b> <b>impulse.</b> The Fast <b>Impulse</b> <b>Current</b> Generator, described in previous works and based on the floating electrode principle, produces almost constant <b>current</b> <b>impulses</b> probably due to: a) the low inductance of its discharge path, or b) the corona space charge recombination process that could occur in the corona charging mechanism. In the present work we study the dependence of output current amplitude and discharge repetition frequency with the modification of the corona charging mechanism. For a certain load value the number of corona sources will be increased from a single source to a number of them. The corona charging current will be analysed by the measurement of the output current. Air at atmospheric conditions will be used as discharge controlled switch in the generator...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{analysis}} of experimental results on the behaviour under <b>impulse</b> <b>currents</b> of various grounding electrodes: rod and horizontal electrodes, a ground grid and tower footings is presented. The parameters used for analysing transient performance are reviewed and differences highlighted based on test data. The analysis is extended to (i) quantify the effect of impulse shape, (ii) quantify the effect of current magnitude, (iii) compare low-frequency and impulse performances, (iv) compare impulse and high frequency performances, and (v) {{examine the effects of}} the test-set up on measured results, e. g. in the case of field tests, the effect of current return leads, and proximity and extent of return electrodes. A generalized impulse index is introduced to help elucidate the differences between different parameters used for the analysis of transient test results on ground electrodes. It is found that the analysis of test data based on different parameters may lead to different assessment of impulse performance. The results also show that the impulse parameters used for the analysis of test data can be influenced by several factors such as electrode length, <b>impulse</b> <b>current</b> rise <b>time</b> and the experimental set up. In addition, variable-frequency test results are analysed by introducing a “harmonic coefficient” which quantifies the deviations of the harmonic impedance from the low-frequency resistance over different frequency ranges covering the entire lightning frequency spectrum. Significant variations of the harmonic coefficient with frequency were observed, highlighting the importance of taking the frequency-dependence of soil properties when modelling impulse and high-frequency behaviour of grounding systems...|$|R
