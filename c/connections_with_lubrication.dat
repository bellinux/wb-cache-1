40|$|The {{presented}} work involved model {{corrosion tests}} of silica -zirconia glass fibers with {{two different types}} of <b>lubrication</b> (Anti-Crack HD <b>with</b> dispersible <b>lubrication</b> and Anti-Crack HP <b>with</b> non-dispersible <b>lubrication).</b> Also the corrosion tests of fibers <b>with</b> <b>lubrication</b> removed by firing was studied. All types of fibers were leached in alkaline solutions (Ca(OH) ₂ with pH 12. 7, KOH with pH 12. 7 and 14) at temperature of 80 °C for 7 - 42 days. Changes in corrosion solutions composition and in glass surface were measured and characterized (AAS, ICP-OES and SEM-EDS, XRF, XRD resp.). The leaching results were similar for both types of fibers <b>with</b> or without <b>lubrication.</b> After leaching in the Ca(OH) ₂ (pH 12. 7), the fibers were covered with calcium precipitates. On fibers <b>with</b> <b>lubrication</b> the precipitate contained mainly crystalline calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxide, while on fibers <b>with</b> removed <b>lubrication</b> the precipitate also contained silicate. After the calcium-containing precipitates were removed with an acid solution, pitting corrosion was visible on fibers <b>with</b> <b>lubrication</b> while fibers without <b>lubrication</b> were covered <b>with</b> a corrosion layer without a significant change in the surface composition. The fibers practically did not dissolve in that environment. In KOH (pH 12. 7) the fibers slightly dissolved but without visible precipitates, the composition of all types of fibers did not substantially changd In KOH (pH 14) the fibers dissolved more significantly. On the surface of the fibers a ZrO₂ and silica containing corrosion layer was formed. The time dependences of dissolved glass components indicates the incongruent dissolution of the fibers with selective leaching of sodium ions or congruent dissolution followed by precipitation of SiO₂, or SiO₂ with calcium ions from the solution. It is likely that both the created precipitates (calcium or calcium-silica) and the developed corrosion layers (silica -zircon dioxide) may operate as a barrier which slows down further corrosion of glass fibers...|$|R

As locomotive development proceeded, larger superheaters were fitted and steam temperatures increased.

40|$|Parametric {{tests were}} {{conducted}} with an optimized 35 -mm-bore-angular-contact ball bearing on a high-speed, high-temperature bearing tester. Results from both air-oil mist lubrication and oil-jet lubrication systems used to lubricate the bearing were compared to speeds of 2. 5 x 10 (exp 6) DN. The maximum obtainable speed <b>with</b> air-oil mist <b>lubrication</b> is 2. 5 x 10 (exp 6) DN. Lower bearing temperatures and higher power losses are obtained <b>with</b> oil-jet <b>lubrication</b> than <b>with</b> air-oil mist <b>lubrication.</b> Bearing power loss is a direct function of oil flow to the bearing and independent of oil delivery system. For a given oil-flow rate, bearing temperature and power loss increase with increases in speed. Bearing life is an inverse function of temperature, the difference in temperature between the individual bearing ring components, and the resultant elastohydrodynamic (EHD) film thicknesses. Bearing life is independent of the oil delivery system except as it affects temperature. Cage slip increased with increases in speed. Cage slip as high as 7 % was measured and was generally higher <b>with</b> air-oil mist <b>lubrication</b> than <b>with</b> oil-jet <b>lubrication...</b>|$|R

We examined the relationship of diabetes to sexual function in middle-aged and older women. Sexual function was examined in a cross-sectional cohort of ethnically diverse women aged 40 - 80 years using self-administered questionnaires. Multivariable regression models compared self-reported sexual desire, frequency of sexual activity, overall sexual satisfaction, and specific sexual problems (difficulty <b>with</b> <b>lubrication,</b> arousal, orgasm, or pain) among insulin-treated diabetic, non-insulin-treated diabetic, and nondiabetic women. Additional models assessed relationships between diabetic end-organ complications (heart disease, stroke, renal dysfunction, and peripheral neuropathy) and sexual function. Among the 2, 270 participants, mean±standard deviation age was 55 ± 9. 2 years, 1, 006 (44. 4 %) were non-Latina white, 486 (21. 4 %) had diabetes, and 139 (6. 1 %) were taking insulin. Compared with 19. 3 % of nondiabetic women, 34. 9 % of insulin-treated diabetic women (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2. 04, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 32 - 3. 15) and 26. 0 % of non-insulin-treated diabetic women (adjusted OR 1. 42, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 94) reported low overall sexual satisfaction.

Among all diabetic women, end-organ complications such as heart disease, stroke, renal dysfunction, and peripheral neuropathy were associated with decreased sexual function in at least one domain. Compared with nondiabetic women, diabetic women are more likely to report low overall sexual satisfaction. Insulin-treated diabetic women also appear at higher risk for problems such as difficulty <b>with</b> <b>lubrication</b> and orgasm. Prevention of end-organ complications may be important in preserving sexual activity and function in diabetic women. II. © 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc...|$|R
