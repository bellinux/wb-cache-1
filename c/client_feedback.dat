40|$|Abstract—A key {{challenge}} to low-latency wireless video stream-ing, where persistent retransmission is impractical, is error control. While SP-frame adaptation of H. 264 has potential to mitigate error propagation, streaming server is often either situated {{too far to}} react {{in a timely fashion}} to <b>client</b> <b>feedbacks,</b> or too computationally constrained to perform the necessarily complex adaptation simultaneously for multiple clients in dif-ferent sessions. In this paper, we present an innovative error control mechanism using SP-frames of H. 264 and performed by a network intermediary for video streaming to a wireless client. Using an intermediary means it is more responsive to <b>client</b> <b>feedbacks</b> due to its close proximity, and it can offload computation complexity from the streaming server. Simulation shows that about 2 dB improvement in PSNR is achievable for video streaming with low latency requirements over traditional schemes using I and P-frames only. I...|$|R
40|$|Streaming {{media in}} 3 G {{wireless}} networks means the streaming server must simultaneously adapt the media content to two mediums of drastically different characteristics: an often congested wired network and an unreliable wireless link. To improve the server’s media adaptiveness, we enhance a previously proposed network proxy, {{located at the}} junction of the wired network and wireless link, to provide timely feedbacks to the server. The enhanced proxy is called Streaming Agent (SA). SA timely feedbacks provide partial path information for the server to track the wired client state — which packets have arrived correctly and on-time at SA. Armed with knowledge of wired client state, the server can in real-time better adapt the streaming content accordingly. We demonstrate SA’s usefulness {{in the context of}} the format-adaptation problem: two video streams with the same bit rate but different I-frame frequencies are switched back and forth depending on SA and/or <b>client</b> timely <b>feedbacks.</b> We show that using a scheme that adapts to both SA and <b>client</b> <b>feedbacks,</b> visual quality can be improved up to 0. 78 dB at 230 kbits/s over a scheme that adapts to <b>client</b> <b>feedbacks</b> only.

In this work, we propose the double feedback streaming agent (DFSA) which further allows the detection of discrepancies in the transmission constraints of the wired and wireless networks. By working together with the streaming server and client, DFSA reduce overall packet losses by exploiting the excess capacity of the path with more capacity.

In this way, the platform enables customers to extract multiple options for creative solutions before making a final selection. Crowdsourcing designers also makes available a larger pool of the best available talent from among freelancers, who would otherwise not be available within a single organisation or agency. Designers can apply to become providers on the Jade Magnet network, and are then invited participate in live internal contests the ones that are of interest to them. Jade Magnet also sources designers and artists by visiting art schools and design colleges where there is a ready community willing to participate in any invitation for crowdsourcing ideas. Providers who perform well on projects and receive good customer feedback can become Jade Magnet Champions, which ensures them a steady stream of projects. Jade Magnet has developed a community engagement system for all providers (students, moonlighters, small agencies and freelancers), offering introductory skill appraisals, appraisal and accreditation based on <b>client</b> <b>feedback</b> and opportunities for creative skill enhancement.

5000|$|Outside of {{participant}} motivation, {{there are other}} factors that influence the appearance of demand characteristics in a study. Many of these factors relate to the unique nature of the experimental setting itself. For example, participants in studies are more likely to put up with uncomfortable or tedious tasks simply because they are in an experiment. Additionally, the mannerisms of the experimenter, such as the way they greet the participant, or the way they interact with the participant {{during the course of the}} experiment may inadvertently bias how the participant responds during the course of the experiment. Finally, prior experiences of being in an experiment, or rumors of the experiment that participants may hear can greatly bias the way they respond. Outside of an experiment, these types of past experiences and mannerisms may have significant effects on how patients rank the effectiveness of their therapist. Many of the ways therapists go about collecting <b>client</b> <b>feedback</b> involve self-report measures, which can be highly influenced by response bias. Participants may be biased if they fill out these measure in front of their therapist, or somehow feel compelled to answer in an affirmative matter because they believe their therapy should be working. In this case, the therapists would not be able to gain accurate feedback from their clients, and be unable to improve their therapy or accurately tailor further treatment to what the participants need. [...] All of these different examples may have significant effects on the responses {{of participant}}s, driving them to respond in ways that do not reflect their actual beliefs or actual mindset, which negatively impact conclusions drawn from those surveys.|$|E
5000|$|The F760X 'Compex' limiter {{was made}} up of three main parts; a compressor, limiter and a 'noise reducing' expander/gate. All of these parts could be used {{separately}} or together for well controlled sound limiting. This combination came about from <b>client</b> <b>feedback.</b> From the feedback ADR designed and built the first units, these were labelled as F760X-RS (RS meaning rack-mount stereo). Later modifications were made and another version was released with a better, ergonomically designed, front panel. This later model was labelled as the 'Compex'.The 'Compex' limiter provided peak limiting with a multi-ratio, variable threshold compressor. Ratio settings ranged from 1:1 to 20:1 and there were controls for threshold and release time. The inclusion of an expander/gate provided attenuation of the gain during pauses in the audio signal to reduce noise caused by compression; the expander/gate could also be used for special 'punchy' effects, favoured on drum and percussive sounds. Noise gates were often criticised at the time for 'hunting' around the threshold point. The 'Compex' used clever hysteresis around the gate, this was important to stop unpredictable opening and closing of the gate; the open threshold was higher than the close threshold.The gain reduction controlled by the 'Compex' was monitored from two meters located {{to the right of the}} front panel. There were two light indicators; a red light lit when the signal level reached its peak, and when in expand mode a green light was lit. There were a set of lights for each channel, depending if the unit was the stereo or mono version.There were some different models of the 'Compex' available; one of these included a smaller console module named the F760-N. This version was built without the expander/gate, it later had an expander/gate added and was then known as the F760X-N. There is also a rare version called F760X-RS/T. One of the visible differences are the VU-meters, which got the brand [...] "Audio & Design Recording LTD." [...] and if you look on the rear, there you can see the type.The [...] "T" [...] stands for transformer, which are said to add harmonics to the sound.The [...] "T" [...] version was mainly used in broadcasting stations, mainly because of its SNR and headroom. ADR also built an F760 version for the Helios mixing consoles.|$|E

The problem is that in 802. 11 wireless environments TCP always considers that the packet loss is caused by network congestion. However, in these networks packet loss are usually caused by the high bit error rate, and the wireless link failures. Researchers found out that TCP performance in wireless networks can be highly enhanced {{as long as it}} is feasible to identify the packet loss causes; hence appropriate measures can be dynamically applied during an established TCP session in order to adjust the session parameters. This paper proposes an endto-end adaptive mechanism that allows the TCP session to dynamically adjust the RTO (Retransmission Timeout) of a TCP session; the server will have to adjust the timers based on <b>feedbacks</b> from <b>clients.</b> <b>Feedbacks</b> are piggybacked in the TCP Options header field of the ACK (Acknowledgment) messages. A feedback is an approximation of the time needed by the wireless channel to get the errors fixed.
