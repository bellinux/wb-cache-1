This has led to <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>competences</b> between federal (mining regulation) and state agencies (water resource management) because different concepts and styles of management are involved.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the Articles 30, 34 and 36 of the EC-Treaty and <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> between the Community and the Member States. It deals {{especially with the}} delimitation between community concerns and national concerns {{in the field of}} non-tariff barriers to trade in community law. A new perspective concerning the application of Articles 30 and 34 of the EC-Treaty is introduced. It is argued that the application of Articles 30 and 34 of the Treaty could be based upon the criterion that national measures may not interpret with the possibilities of the producer to chose market for his product and may not interfere with the possibilities of the purchaser to choose between domestic and imported goods. This new criterion is derived from an investigation of the case law of the EC-Court concerning the Articles 30, 34 and the exception rules according to Article 36 and the so-called Cassis-doctrine (also called the rule of reason). Concerning agricultural goods, the principle of pre-emption of community law is decisive when delimiting community concerns from national concerns. In relation to national price- and profit regulations concerning agricultural goods the case law of the EC-Court must in general be more pragmatic than the conceptualist-federalist approach which was introduced in the Galli-judgement. This is i. e. due to the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. It seems that the EC-Court has been inspired by the case law of the U. S. Supreme Court, when developing its own case law in this particular field of community law. As the political integration at a community level increases, it may be assumed that the importance of the above mentioned rules of the EC-Treaty to promote integration is reduced. Too much harmonization can counteract market integration. Decentralization can thus also protect the achievement of the objectives of the EC-Treaty concerning the free movement of goods...|$|R

The international standardisation community appears to believe that greater focus on quality system elements will contribute to increased confidence in the work performed by organisations that implement them. Unfortunately, a valid system only guarantees consistent output. The potential danger of laboratory tests that are consistent but wrong is too great to be ignored.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 48 - 53). Sibling {{relationships are}} {{considered one of}} the longest peer relationships people maintain over the course of their lifetimes. However, less is known about the interpersonal communicative behaviors in nonvoluntary relationships, such as the sibling relationship. This study proposed an extension of Olson???s circumplex model, a model predominately used to analyze and treat families going through therapy. This extension and application of the model introduced dimensions of relational communication to the family context of sibling relationships. Dimensions explored in this study were relational maintenance behaviors (RMBs), conflict, relational quality, and birth spacing among geographically distanced sibling pairs. Specifically, it was expected that siblings balanced on the dimensions of cohesion and flexibility would communicate and function more effectively than unbalanced sibling relationships. An online survey was completed by 297 participants located at a large southwestern university. Results primarily supported the hypothesis concerning balanced sibling relationships as proposed by the circumplex model. Specifically, balanced sibling relationships predominately utilized more RMBs than unbalanced sibling relationships. Balanced sibling pairs also reported lower levels <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> than unbalanced sibling pairs. The use of positive communication was associated with perceptions <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>competence,</b> and such perceptions <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> were associated with relational quality. Additionally, this study analyzed how geographic distance played a role in balanced family relationships and use of relational maintenance behaviors. However, effects of geographic distance on the sibling relationship appeared minimal. It appears that short-term or temporary distance does not significantly affect siblings??? uses of RMBs, frequency <b>of</b> <b>conflict,</b> or relational quality. Implications for this analysis include support for sibling dyads going through times of change and application of Olson???s circumplex model to effectively functioning sibling pairs. After further discussion of theoretical and practical implications, this analysis concludes with limitations and directions for future research...|$|R

40|$|The {{theme for}} this study is {{communication}} during conflict. The purpose has been to look closer at how employees experience the communication with a colleague or a leader when conflicts occur at the work place. In this study a qualitative approach has been used which at a great extent is inspired by phenomenology and hermeneutics. The term experience is tied to sense and perception from a phenomenological perspective. Furthermore, the term preunderstanding is tied to a hermeneutic understanding, which implies that the individual through experiencing a phenomenon only partially is able to set aside own perspectives. The collecting of data was completed by interviewing four informants. During the analysis the coding is conducted through the method of systematical de-contextualization. The results of the analysis consists of two main categories; Awareness of own experiences and A relational perspective. The categories constitute the main theme {{of the study and}} consist of the subcategories View of human and View <b>of</b> <b>conflict,</b> and Recognition <b>of</b> <b>competence</b> and Openness for dialogue.
