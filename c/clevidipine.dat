40|$|Interruption of the {{coronary}} {{blood flow}} causes myocardial ischemia and, after {{a critical time}} period, myocardial cell death. Accordingly, early reinstitution of arterial blood flow is necessary to minimize the damage. There is, however, ample evidence that restoration of arterial blood flow per se will increase functional and structural injury (ischemialreperfusion injury) in the jeopardized myocardium. Cytosolic calcium overloading in the myocytes {{is supposed to be}} one of the major mechanisms and calcium antagonists have been reported to have beneficial effects. However, the site of action and myocardial protective mechanisms of this class of drugs are far from understood. The development of an ultrashort-acting calcium antagonist, <b>clevidipine</b> recently opened new possibilities for investigating the site of action and mechanisms behind the cardioprotective effects of calcium antagonists. In Study I, using Langendorff-perfused rat hearts, some basic cardiac pharmacology of <b>clevidipine</b> was examined and compared with that of isradipine and nifedipine. Spontaneous heart rate and atrio-ventricular conduction were not affected by <b>clevidipine,</b> while nifedipine and isradipine caused a decrease in heart rate and atrio-ventricular block at high concentrations. In Study II pigs were subjected to 45 min of LAD ligation followed by 240 min of reperfusion. Either <b>clevidipine</b> or the vehicle was administered to the ischemic myocardium by retrograde coronary venous infusion in association with reperfusion. The infarct size was determined with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. The results demonstrated that <b>clevidipine</b> exerted cardioprotective effects against ischemialreperfusion injury. The protection was probably generated by local mechanisms within the ischemic tissue. In Study III pigs were subjected to 45 min of myocardial ischemia followed by 120 min of reperfusion via the left internal thoracic artery using an off-pump coronary arterial bypass grafting model. The animals were divided into 4 groups: one control group, one group given <b>clevidipine</b> (Cle), one group subjected to ischemic preconditioning (IP) and the last group received both Cle and IP. In the groups subjected to IP, the LAD was occluded for 5 min and reperfused for 15 min before the 45 min of ischemia. In all groups, <b>clevidipine</b> or vehicle was administered for 3 min via an intracoronary arterial infusion to the ischemic area, starting 5 min after induction of ischemia. Both <b>clevidipine</b> and ischemic preconditioning were myocardioprotective and the combination of <b>clevidipine</b> and ischemic preconditioning caused additive protection compared with ischemic preconditioning only. In Study IV pigs were subjected to ischemia through LAD ligation for 15, 35, or 45 min while one group was left without LAD occlusion. <b>Clevidipine</b> was infused for 5 min through a catheter distal to the LAD ligation in the ischemic pig hearts, or at the corresponding site of the non-ligated LAD. The pigs were subjected to 60 min of reperfusion or in the non-ligated group following the drug infusion. Blood samples were obtained from the femoral artery and the coronary vein for analysis of <b>clevidipine.</b> The results show that in pigs <b>clevidipine</b> has an ultrashort blood half-life of less than 0. 5 min. Very low levels of <b>clevidipine</b> were detected in the coronary venous blood only during the first two min of reperfusion and there were no detectable levels in the arterial blood at any time. In Study V pigs were subjected to 45 min of LAD occlusion followed by 240 min of reperfusion. <b>Clevidipine</b> was infused over 5 min into the LAD starting at 5, 35 or 44 min after the onset of ischemia. The infarct size was determined as in Study II. The study revealed that blockade of calcium influx by <b>clevidipine</b> either at the early phase of ischemia or just prior to reperfusion limited infarct size. However, when the drug was given late during the ischemia it did not salvage myocardial tissue at risk. This indicates that calcium influx is of variable pathophysiological importance during different phases of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. In conclusion <b>clevidipine</b> has pharmacokinetic properties that makes it a relevant pharmacological tool for studying the cardioprotective mechanisms of calcium antagonists. It was found that <b>clevidipine</b> reduces myocardial damage caused by ischemia followed by reperfusion in pigs. Moreover, it is likely that blockade of calcium influx during the early phase of ischemia and at the time of reperfusion are protective, while administration of the drug during a late phase of ischemia does not influence the final infarct size. Finally, when given together with ischemic preconditioning <b>clevidipine</b> enhances myocardioprotection compared to ischemic preconditioning alone...|$|E
40|$|Introduction.

The purpose of this analysis was to assess the safety and efficacy of <b>clevidipine</b> in patients with RD. Methods. VELOCITY, a multicenter open-label study of severe hypertension, enrolled 126 patients with persistent systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 180 mmHg. Investigators pre-specified a SBP initial target range (ITR) for each patient to be achieved within 30 min. Blood pressure monitoring was by cuff. <b>Clevidipine</b> was infused via peripheral IV at 2 mg/h for at least 3 min, then doubled every 3 min as needed to a maximum of 32 mg/h (non-weightbased treat-to-target protocol). Per protocol, <b>clevidipine</b> was continued for at least 18 h (96 h maximum). RD was diagnosed and reported as an end-organ injury by the investigator and was defined as requiring dialysis or an initial creatinine > 2. 0 mg/dl. Primary endpoints were the percentage of patients within the ITR by 30 min and the percentage below the ITR after 3 min of <b>clevidipine</b> infusion. Results. Of the 24 patients with moderate to severe RD, most (13 / 24) were dialysis dependent. Forty-six percent were male, with mean age 51 > 14 years; 63 % were black and 96 % had a hypertension history.

40|$|Abstract: While {{the chronic}} form of {{hypertension}} is most common; the acute form presents the greater danger, with {{more frequent and}} severe complications and poorer short‑term prognosis compared to chronic hypertension. Antihypertensive drugs are used to treat acute hypertension according to {{the condition of the}} patient, target organ injured, and the resources available to monitor the patient. However, the limited number of medications intended for the aggressive management of acute hypertensive has highlighted the need for newer drugs that offer a rapid decrease of blood pressure (BP) without increasing the possible complications. After ten years of research and trials, <b>clevidipine</b> was approved by the FDA in 2008, and has been widely used to reduce BP when oral therapy is inappropriate.

40|$|Myocardial {{ischaemia}} initiates complex severe cellular changes and, after {{a critical}} time period, myocardial cell death. Despite that restitution of coronary blood flow is an absolute pre-requisite for tissue survival, myocardial reperfusion per se will also increase irreversible damage in the jeopardised myocardium. Endothelial dysfunction is an early event during ischaemia and reperfusion, which is characterised by an impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxations, mainly due to reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and increased production of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1). Certain ET-I receptor antagonists and calcium channels blockers may {{in addition to their}} classical actions, affect NO bioavailability. The aim of the studies was to investigate the involvement and mechanisms of the endothelial factors NO and ET- I in the pathophysiology of myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion damage. Of particular interest was the importance of NO bioavailability for the cardioprotective effects of pharmacological intervention by an ETA receptor antagonist and a short-acting calcium antagonist. 1. Administration of the selective ETA receptor antagonist LU 135252 i. v. 10 min before ischaemia reduced infarct size (IS) and attenuated the increase in myocardial ET-like immunoreactivity in anaesthetised pigs subjected to 45 min of ischaemia and 4 h of reperfusion. These cardioprotective effects were abolished in the presence of NO synthase (NOS) inhibition by L-NNA and restored by addition of the NO precursor L-arginine. NOS inhibition did not affect IS per se. 2. Administration of ET- I i. v. during three 5 min infusion periods separated by 5 min before ischaemia reduced IS in anaesthetised rats subjected to 30 min of ischaemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion. This preconditioning (PC) -like cardioprotective effect was blocked either by the ETA receptor antagonist LU 135252, the nonselective ATP sensitive K+ channels (KATP) antagonist glibenclamide or the selective mithochondrial KATP channel antagonist 5 -hydroxydecanoic acid. 3. Intracoronary administration of short-acting calcium antagonist <b>clevidipine</b> during the last 10 min of ischaemia and the first 5 min of reperfusion reduced IS and preserved endothelium-dependent vasodilation induced by substance P in anaesthetised pigs. The cardioprotective effect of <b>clevidipine</b> was abolished when it was administered together with the NOS inhibitor L-NMMA. Addition of L-arginine restored cardioprotection induced by <b>clevidipine.</b> The cardioprotective effect of <b>clevidipine</b> was also abolished, when it was given together with the bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist HOE 140. Addition of the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (SNAP) restored cardioprotection. 4. Intracoronary administration of the NO donor SNAP in a narrow concentration range for a brief period before ischaemia reduced IS, attenuated myeloperoxidase activity as index of neutrophil accumulation in the ischaemic/reperfused myocardium and improved endothelium-dependent coronary vasodilation induced by substance P in anaesthetised pigs. In conclusion, the cardioprotective effect of the ETA receptor antagonist during ischaemia and reperfusion is mediated via a mechanism related to no; under certain conditions exogenous ET- 1 may also exert cardioprotection in vivo via the ETA receptor and activation of mitochondrial KATP channels; the cardioprotective effect of the short-acting calcium antagonist <b>clevidipine</b> during late ischaemia and early reperfusion is mediated via bradykinin- and NO-related mechanisms; NO exerts a classic PC-like cardioprotection against ischaemiareperfusion injury in vivo in a narrow concentration range...|$|E
30|$|In the {{presence}} of increased adrenergic tone, tachycardia is typically present. Withdrawal syndromes are {{an example of this}} category. β-blocking agents are good options for the control of hypertension associated with hyperadrenergic states. If acute reduction in cardiac output is of concern, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (e.g., nicardipine, <b>clevidipine)</b> may be preferred, because these agents have fewer negative effects on the heart rate and myocardial contractility. These agents provide an interesting option for the treatment of postoperative hypertension [28]. If a vasodilating effect is best avoided (e.g., in {{the presence}} of increased intracranial hypertension), clonidine may be a good alternative to β-blocking agents.|$|E
40|$|Background: Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is the primary}} cause of death in adults in the industrialised world and {{ventricular}} fibrillation associated with myocardial ischemia is the main cause of sudden cardiac death. Restoration of blood flow and preservation of myocardial integrity throughout ischemia and reperfusion is essential to improve clinical outcome. Alteration in calcium handling and its consequences are central features of these events. Sympathico-vagal imbalance and electrophysiological alterations are important predisposing factors for malign ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Aims: To investigate whether ultra-short acting calcium antagonism or spinal cord stimulation (SCS) could reduce myocardial ischemia and infarct size in a porcine closed-chest model. Furthermore, the feasibility of endocardial electromechanical mapping for defining myocardial viability during acute infarction was evaluated. Finally, non-invasive electrophysiological characteristics of ischemia-reperfusion and the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias were investigated as well as the effects of SCS on these measures and events. Methods: Myocardial infarction was induced by 45 minute coronary occlusion in closed-chest landrace pigs. An ultra-short acting calcium antagonist, <b>clevidipine,</b> was administered into the myocardium at risk. Myocardial viability was assessed by Evans Blue, tetrazolium and endocardial electromechanical mapping and the correlation between these methods was investigated. Three-dimensional vectorcardiography was continuously recorded, analysed offline with regard to depolarisation and repolarisation parameters, and later correlated to myocardial ischemia and ventricular arrhythmia. In a second series of experiments, the effects of SCS were investigated with regards to haemodynamics, infarct size, ventricular arrhythmia and electrophysiology. Results: <b>Clevidipine</b> did not reduce infarct size. Electrical and mechanical activities were both impaired within the infarct zone, but the precision of electromechanical mapping to identify an infarct was poor, and due to intersegmental variability and arrhythmia. All T vector loop parameters changed in response to ischemia. Ventricular arrhythmia was more prevalent during proximal left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, which was associated with more pronounced electrophysiological alterations. In the SCS group, ventricular arrhythmia occurred less frequently in association with signs of less ischemia and electrical alterations. SCS did not reduce infarct size. Conclusions: Infarct size was neither reduced by ultra-short acting calcium antagonism nor by SCS, but the latter seemed to have cardioprotective properties as it reduced the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia. Endocardial electromechanical mapping was not feasible for acute myocardial viability assessment...|$|E
30|$|These drugs inhibit calcium influx through voltage-sensitive L-type calcium {{channels}} in vascular smooth muscle cells inducing arteriolar vasodilation and reducing SVR. They {{are divided into}} two pharmacological classes: dihydropyridines and nondihydropyridine derivatives. The dihydropyridines (e.g., nifedipine, nicardipine, amlodipine) are the largest class, and members have greater vasodilatory potency and less negative chronotropic activity, making them relatively safe for patients with hypertension. However, they can be potentially hazardous in patients with severe heart failure because of the calcium entry blocking effects. Two agents, nicardipine and <b>clevidipine,</b> are available for continuous intravenous infusion {{for the management of}} arterial hypertension. Nicardipine is a second-generation dihydropyridine with high hydrosolubility, and short onset but a relatively long duration of action. Its dosage is weight-independent, easily titrated, and it promotes cerebral and coronary vasodilation [41]. Nicardipine has been used for the treatment of severe hypertension, particularly in the perioperative period [42, 43], and has recently been shown to be superior to labetalol in treating acute severe hypertension in emergency department patients [44], including those with end-organ damage [45], and also in critically ill patients [46].|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Hospitalization {{costs in}} {{clinical}} trials are typically derived by multiplying the length of stay (LOS) by an average per-diem (PD) cost from external sources. This assumes that PD costs are independent of LOS. Resource utilization in {{early days of the}} stay is usually more intense, however, and thus, the PD cost for a short hospitalization may be higher than for longer stays. The shape of this relationship is unlikely to be linear, as PD costs would be expected to gradually plateau. This paper describes how to model the relationship between PD cost and LOS using flexible statistical modelling techniques. Methods An example based on a clinical study of <b>clevidipine</b> for the treatment of peri-operative hypertension during hospitalizations for cardiac surgery is used to illustrate how inferences about cost-savings associated with good blood pressure (BP) control during the stay can be affected by the approach used to derive hospitalization costs. Data on the cost and LOS of hospitalizations for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) from the Massachusetts Acute Hospital Case Mix Database (the MA Case Mix Database) were analyzed to link LOS to PD cost, factoring in complications that may have occurred during the hospitalization or post-discharge. The shape of the relationship between LOS and PD costs in the MA Case Mix was explored graphically in a regression framework. A series of statistical models including those based on simple logarithmic transformation of LOS to more flexible models using LOcally wEighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) techniques were considered. A final model was selected, using simplicity and parsimony as guiding principles in addition traditional fit statistics (like Akaike’s Information Criterion, or AIC). This mapping was applied in ECLIPSE to predict an LOS-specific PD cost, and then a total cost of hospitalization. These were then compared for patients who had good vs. poor peri-operative blood-pressure control. Results The MA Case Mix dataset included data from over 10, 000 patients. Visual inspection of PD vs. LOS revealed a non-linear relationship. A logarithmic model and a series of LOESS and piecewise-linear models with varying connection points were tested. The logarithmic model was ultimately favoured for its fit and simplicity. Using this mapping in the ECLIPSE trials, we found that good peri-operative BP control was associated with a cost savings of $ 5, 366 when costs were derived using the mapping, compared with savings of $ 7, 666 obtained using the traditional approach of calculating the cost. Conclusions PD costs vary systematically with LOS, with short stays being associated with high PD costs that drop gradually and level off. The shape of the relationship may differ in other settings. It is important to assess this and model the observed pattern, as this may have an impact on conclusions based on derived hospitalization costs. </p...|$|E
