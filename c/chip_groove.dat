40|$|Magnetic head made of {{polycrystalline}} ferrite sintered by HIP {{method is}} widely used in an audio and video installation. Work damage such as a chipping induced by slicing of ferrite {{gives rise to the}} deterioration of an electro-magnetic property of the magnetic head. Micro-crack growth modes of ferrite by an indentation and scribing tests with an diamond indenter are examined in detail by SEM microscopy and by an acoustic emmission method. It is found that micro-crack growth modes are very different among the ferrite materials with same hardness of physical property. <b>Chipping</b> at <b>groove</b> corner yielded by slicing of ferrite with a diamond blade is closely related to micro-crack growth of a grain.

40|$|Machining {{simulations}} of orthogonal cutting are performed using the {{finite element method}} to predict <b>chip</b> formation in <b>grooved</b> tool cutting. A flat-faced cutting tool is first simulated to check {{the validity of the}} model, and the results obtained are used as a basis for comparison in grooved tool cutting simulation. Grooved tool simulations are modeled next to investigate the effect of a <b>groove</b> on the <b>chip</b> formation process. <b>Groove</b> depth and width were the two parameters changed for the purpose of analyzing the chip flow characteristics, stress and strain distributions found in the chip.;For all simulated cases, it is observed that a groove definitely impart more curl on the chip, and more tensile and/or compressive near the chip root, a condition conducive to chip breaking. More curling is observed when the groove radius of curvature is reduced by increasing the groove depth or decreasing the groove width. It is also observed that the increase in normal tensile stress at the chip root next to the tool tip is proportional to the amount of curl displayed in the chip. However, the increase in normal compressive stress is related to the increase in chip thickness, a variable that depends on the effective rake angle of cutting...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the loading and {{trapping}} of ultracold atoms in a one dimensional permanent magnetic lattice of period 10 micron produced on an atom <b>chip.</b> The <b>grooved</b> structure which generates the magnetic lattice potential is fabricated on a silicon substrate and coated with a perpendicularly magnetized multilayered TbGdFeCo/Cr film of effective thickness 960 nm. Ultracold atoms are evaporatively cooled in a Z-wire magnetic trap and then adiabatically transferred to the magnetic lattice potential by applying an appropriate bias field. Under our experimental conditions trap frequencies of up to 90 kHz in the magnetic lattice are measured and the atoms are trapped {{at a distance of}} less than 5 micron from the surface with a measured lifetime of about 450 ms.

40|$|The Southwest Iberian Middle Bronze Age culture, {{although}} {{widespread in}} southern Portugal and nearby areas of southwest Spain in the Middle Bronze Age, is characterised by {{the scarcity of}} preserved human remains. Recent reanalysis of the human remains unearthed from the grave cists of the necropolis of Casas Velhas (Melides, Portugal), with a minimal number of 21 individuals (19 adults and 2 non-adults), included {{the analysis of the}} dental remains to assess information about non-masticatory behaviour and oral pathology of these individuals. Dental data scored included dental wear, oral lesions (<b>chipping</b> and <b>grooves),</b> and atypical dental wear patterns. The mean dental wear is low (2. 93; n= 90), although 16 teeth exhibit severe dental wear (> grade 4). Only one tooth displays a cariogenic lesion (1 / 82). Atypical dental wear patterns, chipping and the presence of grooves were recorded in six individuals (6 / 11 = 54. 5 %). The predominant anterior pattern of unusual dental wear and oral lesions were interpreted as highly suggestive of the use of anterior teeth in extra-masticatory activities. The chips observed in posterior teeth were interpreted as mainly resulting from masticatory activities, as the ingestion of hard foods. The obtained results were discussed in terms of a more vegetarian diet proposed for these individuals, as well as, the use of vegetable products, as the treatment of vegetable fibres in daily activities...|$|R

40|$|Manufacturing {{processes}} significantly {{influence the}} type of surface that is being produced. The quality of the surface dictates the functional performance and service-life of engineered components. Residual stresses and surface roughness {{are some of the}} important constituents of these manufactured surfaces. Hence, knowledge about factors that cause residual stresses will contribute to a better fundamental understanding of manufacturing process mechanics and improved knowledge-driven manufacturing process planning. This thesis presents the results of an experimental investigation into the effects of cutting tool coatings and materials, and cutting fluid (CF) application, on residual stresses in machined 7075 -T 6 and 2024 -T 351 aluminum alloys measured using the hole-drilling method. Machining is performed with flat faced and <b>grooved</b> (<b>chip</b> breaker) TiN, TiB 2 coated carbide tools, and uncoated polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tools in three CF application conditions: dry, minimal quantity lubrication (MQL), and flood conditions.

On the implementation of welding using SMAW welding type which is one method of welding is used widely in construction grafting techniques. In welding, there 2 ̆ 7 s common defects such as imperfections of root penetration, hardened and cracked.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of precision dicing and micromilling machining techniques for silica photonic applications. Comparison is given between the studied and conventional techniques for machining silica, such as photolithography and etching, laser machining, etc [...] Precision dicing was used to create low loss input/output facets in the silica-on-silicon platform. It was demonstrated that ductile type dicing can produce facets in a silica-on-silicon substrate with a smooth, mirror like finish. The facet had a surface roughness (Sa) of 4. 9 nm, a factor of ~ 7. 5 improvement on previously reported roughnesses. An individual silica/air average interface loss, caused by surface roughness scatter, was calculated to be - 0. 63 dB and - 0. 76 dB for the TE and TM polarisations, respectively. Utilising dicing, glass photonic microcantilever devices are produced with integrated Bragg gratings and waveguides. Two cantilever interrogations methods have been shown; one utilising a single Bragg grating and the other using a pair of spectrally matched Bragg gratings to form a Fabry-Pérot interferometer. These cantilever devices were subjected to physical stimulus of external pressure change and profilometer actuation. A precision micromill was built by the author. Precision micromilling was used to remove the cladding material from the silica-on-silicon platform, for evanescent field access. By accessing the ductile milling regime, the mill enabled three-dimensional machining of flat, smooth, <b>chip</b> free <b>grooves</b> in silica. A groove with an average surface roughness (Sa) of 3. 0 nm was measured, with a depth of cut of 17 µm. This micromilling method produces grooves that are seven times smoother and cut depths forty times deeper, than previously reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|In {{continuous}} cutting operation, {{the use of}} chip breakers {{has become}} virtually important and much effort has been put into {{the development of a}} wide range of breakers to suit a wide cutting condition. Unexpected chipping will occur on the minor cutting edge, when as insert that has proper chip breaking performance is under optimum cutting condition. Then, the effect of chip breakers on the wear and chipping of inserts have been experimentaly investigated. The progress of crater wear is studied in details with the contour observation of five different chip breakers. The main results obtained are as follow; (1) The chip breaker patterns of tool face affect feed force and thrust force. In the case of the <b>grooved</b> <b>chip</b> breaker, the thrust force is larger than the obstruction type breaker. The chip breaker patterns do not affect the side flow angle if the cutting conditions are the same. (2) The forms of crater wear minor cutting edge chipping are significant influenced with the chip breaker patterns. If the projection of chip breakers is properly worn away with the progress of cutting time, the center of crater of the tool face moves away from the major and the minor cutting edges. The chipping of the minor cutting edge is easy to appear with a decrement in the wear of chip breaker projection...|$|R
