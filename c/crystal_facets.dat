5|$|A {{snowflake}} is {{a single}} ice crystal that has achieved a sufficient size, and may have amalgamated with others, then falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a dust particle in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete in crystal form. Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small <b>crystal</b> <b>facets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once a droplet has frozen, {{it grows}} in the {{supersaturated}} environment—one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets {{are so much more}} numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size {{at the expense of the}} water droplets by the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the ice crystals to grow at the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground.

50|$|Platinum {{nanoparticles}} {{of controlled}} {{shape and size}} have also been accessed through varying the ratio of polymer capping agent concentration to precursor concentration. Reductive colloidal syntheses as such have yielded tetrahedral, cubic, irregular-prismatic, icosahedral, and cubo-octahedral nanoparticles, whose dispersity is also dependent on the concentration ratio of capping agent to precursor, and which may be applicable to catalysis. The precise mechanism of shape-controlled colloidal synthesis is not yet known; however, {{it is known that}} the relative growth rate of <b>crystal</b> <b>facets</b> within the growing nanostructure determines its final shape. Polyol syntheses of platinum nanoparticles, in which chloroplatinic acid is reduced to PtCl42− and Pt0 by ethylene glycol, have also been a means to shape-controlled fabrication. Addition of varying amounts of sodium nitrate to these reactions was shown to yield tetrahedra and octahedra at high concentration ratios of sodium nitrate to chloroplatinic acid. Spectroscopic studies suggest that nitrate is reduced to nitrite by PtCl42− early in this reaction, and that the nitrite may then coordinate both Pt(II) and Pt(IV), greatly slowing the polyol reduction and altering the growth rates of distinct <b>crystal</b> <b>facets</b> within the nanoparticles, ultimately yielding morphological differentiation.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} analog of the Rayleigh {{instability}} {{in the field of}} gravity for the superfluid-crystal 4 He interface provided that the heavier 4 He crystal phase occupies the half-space over the lighter superfluid phase. The conditions and the onset of the gravitational instability are different in kind above and below the roughening transition temperature when the crystal 4 He surface is in the rough or in the smooth faceted state, respectively. In the rough state of the surface the gravitational instability is similar to the classical case of the fluid-fluid interface. In contrast, {{in the case of the}} <b>crystal</b> <b>faceted</b> surface the onset of the gravitational instability is associated with surmounting some potential barrier. The potential barrier results from nonzero magnitude of the linear facet step energy.

It has been widely accepted that photocatalysts with heterojunctions usually exhibit excellent charge separation. However, the migration process of separated charges in the heterojunction structures has not been fully investigated. Herein, photocatalysts with heterojunctions are constructed by loading g-C 3 N 4 nanoparticles onto BiOCl nanosheets with different exposed facets (BOC- 001 and BOC- 010). The g-C 3 N 4 nanoparticles with decreasing size and increasing zeta potential could induce stronger coupling and scattering in the heterojunction. The relationship between the <b>crystal</b> <b>facet</b> orientation in the BiOCl nanosheets and charge separation/effective migration behaviours of the materials is investigated.
