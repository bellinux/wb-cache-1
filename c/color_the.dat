5|$|As a metal, {{titanium}} {{is recognized}} for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It {{is a strong}} metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in <b>color.</b> <b>The</b> relatively high melting point (more than 1,650°C or 3,000°F) makes it useful as a refractory metal. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low electrical and thermal conductivity.|$|E

The complexity of this system led the team to cancel one game. Both Seasons and Ages were a critical success, and together sold eight million units.

5|$|All Silkies {{have black}} or bluish skin, bones and grayish-black meat; their Chinese {{language}} name is wu gu ji (烏骨雞), meaning 'black-boned chicken'. Melanism which {{extends beyond the}} skin into an animal's connective tissue is a rare trait, and in chickens it is caused by fibromelanosis, which is a rare mutation believed to have begun in Asia. The Silkie and several other breeds descended from Asian stock possess the mutation.

5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species {{can be identified}} by their <b>color,</b> <b>the</b> {{time of year when}} they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.|$|E

Levels are mostly composed of platforms formed by blocks. The player's goal in each level is to collect marbles, which give the player points based on their <b>color.</b> <b>The</b> exit from the level is opened once a predetermined number of points have been collected. Danny can crawl into narrow areas and jump a small height.|$|E

Most of the games have been developed by Namco Bandai Games, with other companies such as Griptonite Games and Dimps also developing some titles. The games have been released for a variety of home and handheld game consoles such as the PlayStation, Nintendo DS, and Bandai's own WonderSwan and WonderSwan <b>Color.</b> <b>The</b> series started in 1998 with the Japan-exclusive game Digital Monster Ver.
