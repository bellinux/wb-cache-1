Regenerative endodontic procedures (REPs) have been described as a “paradigm shift” in the treatment of immature teeth with pulp necrosis and underdeveloped roots, as there is the potential for further root maturation and return of vitality. Treatment with REPs is advocated as the treatment of choice for immature teeth with pulp necrosis.

25|$|The {{most common}} {{disinfection}} method involves {{some form of}} chlorine or its compounds such as chloramine or chlorine dioxide. Chlorine is a strong oxidant that rapidly kills many harmful micro-organisms. Because chlorine is a toxic gas, {{there is a danger}} of a release associated with its use. This problem is avoided by the use of sodium hypochlorite, which is a relatively inexpensive solution used in household bleach that releases free chlorine when dissolved in water. Chlorine solutions can be generated on site by electrolyzing common salt solutions. A solid form, <b>calcium</b> <b>hypochlorite,</b> releases chlorine on contact with water. Handling the solid, however, requires greater routine human contact through opening bags and pouring than the use of gas cylinders or bleach which are more easily automated. The generation of liquid sodium hypochlorite is both inexpensive and safer than the use of gas or solid chlorine.|$|E

Materials and Methods: Fifty freshly extracted human maxillary central incisors were selected. Teeth were divided into four experimental groups (n = 10) and one control group (n = 10). Fifty teeth were separated, and roots of each tooth were standardized to a length of 12 mm. Access opening was done and instrumented with ProTaper F 2 passed beyond the apex. The canals were then irrigated with 17 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 3 % sodium <b>hypochlorite.</b> <b>Calcium</b> hydroxide was placed in the canals for 7 days.

Group I: Apical plug MTA with metal post, Group II: Apical plug MTA with Resilon, Group III Apical plug MTA with GP, Group IV: Complete MTA obturation, and Group V: Control group. Fracture strength was measured using Instron testing machine at a speed of 5 mm/min, and the data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and t-test. Results: The roots reinforced with metallic post and MTA (Group 1) has the higher fracture strength when compared with other groups (P < 0. 05).

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} whether clonal diversity within E.  faecalis affects biofilm formation {{when exposed to}} antimicrobial compounds found in endodontic medicaments and irrigants. METHODOLOGY: Five human isolates of E.  faecalis were compared; biofilms were grown in microtitre trays {{in the presence of}} sodium <b>hypochlorite,</b> <b>calcium</b> hydroxide, chlorhexidine, tetracycline or clindamycin. Biofilms were quantified by staining with crystal violet and optical density determined with a microplate reader. Slime production (an amorphous extracellular matrix comprising polysaccharides, glycoproteins and glycolipids loosely attached to the cell surface) was determined qualitatively by growth on Congo red agar plates. Linear mixed models were used to examine whether medicaments affected biofilm growth of the isolates {{in the presence of the}} medicaments or irrigants. RESULTS: Overall, different endodontic antimicrobials significantly altered biofilm growth in E.  faecalis isolates. Two E.  faecalis isolates significantly (P < 0. 0001) increased biofilm formation in the presence of tetracycline and one in the presence of NaOCl (P =  0. 018). Qualitatively, slime production also varied between isolates and correlated with biofilm production. CONCLUSIONS: When subjected to sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels of antimicrobial compounds found in endodontic medicaments, E.  faecalis isolates demonstrated significant clonal variation in their capacity to form biofilms. Interestingly, there was a correlation between slime production and the ability of isolates to form a biofilm in the presence of antimicrobials. The results indicate that isolates of E.  faecalis that form biofilms in response to endodontic medicaments may be more likely to survive endodontic treatment. C. E. Wilson, P. C. Cathro, A. H.

40|$|Abstract A survey {{involving}} 181 {{water treatment}} plants across 7 provinces of South Africa: Mpumalanga, Limpopo, North West, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Western Cape was undertaken {{to identify the}} challenges facing small water treatment plants (SWTPs) in South Africa. Information gathered included ownership and design capacity of the plants, water sources, and various methods of disinfection, equipment currently employed and performance of the treatment plants. In general, the majority (over 80 %) of the SWTPs surveyed in the designated provinces were owned by the district municipalities. The designed capacities of these plants varied between 1 and 60 Mℓ/d; the smallest capacity was 100 m 3 /d and the largest 120 Mℓ/d. The small water treatment plants abstracted their raw water from either surface or groundwater {{or a combination of}} both water sources with greater preponderance for surface water sources (over 86 %). Water treatment practices were noted to be the conventional types mainly coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection. Two types of coagulants namely polyelectrolyte (66 %) and alum (18 %) were commonly used by the water treatment plants across the provinces studied. Rapid gravity filtration, pressure filter and slow sand filtration systems accounted for 60 %, 23 % and 9 % of the filtration systems across the provinces, respectively. The predominant types of disinfectants employed were chlorine gas (69 %) followed by sodium (15 %) and <b>calcium</b> (14 %) <b>hypochlorite.</b> Over 50 % of the various SWTPs did not comply with the SANS 241 Class I (< 1 NTU) and Class II (1 to 5 NTU) recommended turbidity values. The recommended target range of 0. 3 to 0. 6 mg/ℓ free chlorine residual concentrations at the point of use was not always met by 40 % of the plants. Seventy percent of the SWTPs complied with the SANS 241 criteria of microbiological safety of drinking water vis-à-vis total and faecal coliforms. Operational problems affecting the efficiency of small water treatment plants included: inability to appropriately determine the flow rate, chemical dosage and turbidity, lack of chlorine residual at the point of use and lack of water quality monitoring. To produce safe drinking water, appropriate operational practices must be implemented in all small water treatment plants...|$|R
500|$|Chlorine gas {{was first}} used by French chemist Claude Berthollet to bleach {{textiles}} in 1785. Modern bleaches resulted from further work by Berthollet, who first produced sodium hypochlorite in 1789 in his laboratory {{in the town of}} Javel (now part of Paris, France), by passing chlorine gas through a solution of sodium carbonate. The resulting liquid, known as [...] "Eau de Javel" [...] ("Javel water"), was a weak solution of sodium hypochlorite. This process was not very efficient, and alternative production methods were sought. Scottish chemist and industrialist Charles Tennant first produced a solution of <b>calcium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> ("chlorinated lime"), then solid <b>calcium</b> <b>hypochlorite</b> (bleaching powder). These compounds produced low levels of elemental chlorine and could be more efficiently transported than sodium hypochlorite, which remained as dilute solutions because when purified to eliminate water, it became a dangerously powerful and unstable oxidizer. Near {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, E. S. Smith patented a method of sodium hypochlorite production involving electrolysis of brine to produce sodium hydroxide and chlorine gas, which then mixed to form sodium hypochlorite. This is known as the chloralkali process, first introduced on an industrial scale in 1892, and now the source of most elemental chlorine and sodium hydroxide. In 1884 Chemischen Fabrik Griesheim of Germany developed another chloralkali process which entered commercial production in 1888.|$|E
