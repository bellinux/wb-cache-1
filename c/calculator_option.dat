40|$|Morphometric {{analysis}} {{is important in}} any hydrological investigation and it is inevitable in development and management of drainage basin. A critical evaluation and assessment of morphometric parameters and prioritization of micro-watersheds based on water holding capacity of Peruvanthanam sub-watershed have been achieved through measurement of linear, aerial and relief aspects of basins by using remote sensing and GIS techniques, and it necessitates preparation of a detailed drainage map. For prioritization, 9 micro-watersheds are delineated and parameters such as Rb, Dd, Fs,T, Lof and C are calculated separately and prioritization {{has been done by}} using the Raster <b>calculator</b> <b>option</b> of Spatial analyst. The analysis reveals that the stream order varies from 1 to 6 and the total number of stream segments of all orders counted as 347, out of which the maximum area (69. 16 %) is covered by 1 st order streams and the minimum (0. 29 %) by 6 th order. Lower values of Rb (linear parameters) in each order, higher values of Bh (0. 90), Rh (0. 07) and Rn (3. 02) (relief parameters), high values of Dd (3. 36), Fs (6. 15), T (6. 82), low values of Lof (0. 14) and C (0. 30) (aerial parameters) all together reveal that the sub-watershed has a complex structure, mountainous relief, high runoff and low infiltration. The maximum area is covered by high to medium prioritized zones (19. 07 km 2) followed by low to very low (17. 75 km 2) while a Â very high to high zone is only 4. 72 km 2. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Taking into {{consideration}} the growing incidence of osteoporotic fractures, identification of patientswith the highest fracture risk {{seems to be the}} most rational and cost-effective solution of this clinical problem. The fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) is a new diagnostic method, proposed by the World Health Organizationand designed for 10 -year fracture risk evaluation; there is no Polish version of the FRAX calculator yet. Objectives: Assessment of 10 -year fracture risk scores in postmenopausal women of the Lodz population,based on the FRAX algorithm, standardised for the populations of Italy, Spain and the UK. Material and methods: The study group included 94 postmenopausal females (55 - 80), divided into five agesubgroups. The patients completed a questionnaire form, designed to analyze osteoporosis risk factors, andwere then submitted to femoral neck densitometry by a DXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry) scanner (LunarEXPERT). The 10 -year fracture risk was assessed by the FRAX method, using a calculator standardised for the populationsof Italy, Spain and the UK. FRAX major (the risk of main osteoporotic fractures) and FRAX hip (the riskof femoral neck fractures) were calculated, using obtained densitometric results (FMD, FHD) and BMI (FM, FH). Results: In each age subgroup, the highest scores of 10 -year fracture risk (FRAX major, FRAX hip) were obtained,using the UK-oriented calculator, while the lowest ones were found applying the calculator standardisedfor Spain. The differences were statistically significant and affected patient qualification for therapy vs. establishedintervention threshold. Conclusions: 1. The outcome supports the need for a Polish FRAX calculator with a properly adapted interventionthreshold. 2. It is fairly justified to use the British <b>calculator</b> <b>option</b> until the Polish FRAX version isavailable...|$|E
50|$|Once {{the tree}} of prices has been calculated, the option price is found at each node largely as for the {{binomial}} model, by working backwards from the final nodes to today. The difference being that the option value at each non-final node is determined based on the three - as opposed to two - later nodes and their corresponding probabilities. The model is best understood visually - see, for example Trinomial Tree <b>Option</b> <b>Calculator</b> (Peter Hoadley).|$|R

The second option {{is being able to}} code the programs on board the <b>calculator</b> itself. This <b>option</b> is facilitated by the inclusion of full-screen text editors and other programming tools in the default feature set of the calculator or as optional items. Some calculators have QWERTY keyboards and others can be attached to an external keyboard which can be close {{to the size of a}} regular 102-key computer keyboard. Programming is a major use for the software and cables used to connect calculators to computers.|$|R
40|$|The broad {{objective}} of the paper {{is to have an}} understanding of the movement of volatility over a fair period in respect of the market portfolio. Also, it enables an understanding on how divergent the implied volatility has been from this estimate. It uses Volatility Cone, Volatility Smile and Volatility Surface as the parameters. The study takes different rolling periods percentiles of volatility. Hoadley <b>Options</b> <b>Calculator</b> is used for calculation and analysis purpose. The study empirically proves that there is a clear reversion to the mean as indicated by the volatility cone. The study of volatility smiles in respect of NIFTY options throws up different patterns. The Garch (1. 1) model reveals that historical volatility for the period from 2004 to 2004 and for the year 2009 were estimated. Interestingly, but not totally surprisingly, the average implied volatility of calls and puts on Nifty during the period January to March 2010 showed differences...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture accounted for around 10 % of total European Union (EU) emissions in 2010. To reduce farming-related GHG emissions, appropriate policy measures and supporting tools for promoting low-carbon farming practices may be efficacious. This paper presents the methodology and testing {{results of a}} new EU-wide farm-level carbon footprint calculator. The Carbon Calculator quantifies GHG emissions based on international standards and technical specifications on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and carbon footprinting. The tool delivers its results both at the farm level and as allocated to up to five main products of the farm. In addition to the quantification of GHG emissions, the <b>calculator</b> proposes mitigation <b>options</b> and sequestration actions that may be suitable for individual farms. The results obtained during a survey made on 54 farms from eight EU Member States are presented. These farms were selected in view of representing the diversity of farm types across different environmental zones in the EU. Overall, {{it was found that}} the GHG emissions quantified by the tool at product level were comparable with those of other studies focusing on similar products. The results of the mitigation actions showed that the tool can help identify practices that can lead to substantial emission reductions. To avoid burden-shifting from climate change to other environmental issues, the future improvements of the tool should include incorporation of other environmental impact categories in place of solely focusing on GHG emissions.

40|$|The {{embodied}} {{environmental and}} socioeconomic impacts of building construction are rarely considered within industry. Renewable and certified resources {{will continue to}} provide a viable low impact supply chain for construction, yet {{the use of such}} low impact building materials (LIBM) remains a small proportion of the current market. Structural engineers should be encouraged to use LIBM and consider the impacts of building construction, and so the research aim was to create an informed and responsible approach for structural engineers to reduce the embodied impacts of their projects. The limited amount of academic literature on the consideration of embodied impacts within construction and the use of LIBM prompted a two-phase research methodology. The first Problem Exploration phase developed a rich understanding of the current context of embodied impacts within construction through an analysis of data gathered from an online questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The findings identified three key aspects to consider when developing an Embodied Impact Reduction Approach (EIRA); the alignment of the project-life cycle with influence, the limitation of time and costs, and the importance of support and education within the approach created. The second Action phase developed EIRA using the findings and supplementary data gathered from focus groups, which highlighted that EIRA should be flexible so as to be relevant to the breadth of projects that BuroHappold Engineering, who partially sponsored the research, work on. EIRA runs parallel to the RIBA Plan of Work, adapting to the different objectives, level of detail and information available at each project stage. Three components were developed; the Material Design Sheets, Carbon <b>Calculator,</b> and the <b>Option</b> Appraisal Support Technique (tOAST). tOAST was implemented on five projects to test its applicability, which identified that greater understanding of embodied impacts plus their relative importance to each other is required. Another key issue was the availability of appropriate embodied environmental data...|$|R
