5000|$|... "Lipsticks in Piccadilly Circus, London" [...] 1966 {{is a work}} by Claes Oldenburg. In this {{postcard}} collage Oldenburg {{raised an}} everyday <b>cosmetic</b> <b>item</b> to a monumental scale. Made during his stay in London {{at the height of}} the ‘swinging sixties’, it embodies the popular, expendable, sexy imagery of Pop art. Oldenberg remarked: ‘For me, London inspired phallic imagery which went up and down with the tide - like mini-skirts and knees ... like the up-and-down motion of a lipstick’. To replace the Victorian statue of Eros in Piccadilly Circus with lipsticks lifted from an advertisement was, therefore, to update one vision of sexuality with another.|$|E

30|$|Hirsch et al. [6] {{evaluated}} the satisfaction {{at the time}} of insertion of fixed prostheses and after 1 year of follow-up in 76 patients treated with 124 zygomatic implants.
