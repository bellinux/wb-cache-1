50|$|Without the {{requirement}} that f(1) = 1, one <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> f(1) = 0, but then f(a) = 0 for all positive integers a, {{so this is not}} a very strong restriction.|$|R
50|$|Had {{the merger}} gone ahead, these {{arrangements}} <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> been amended, as {{they needed to}} be approved by a vote of the remaining clubs; but when the merger was averted, the vote never went ahead.|$|R
50|$|Many caves have shafts or drops {{that require}} ropes or ladders to pass. Wire ladders {{have largely been}} {{superseded}} by ropes for descending Pitch (vertical space) since the early '60s, though ladders <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>useful</b> applications on shorter pitches, where full abseiling gear would be inappropriate.|$|R
50|$|Fans {{had been}} {{divided on the}} {{proposed}} idea; many expressed willingness {{in the hope that}} they <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> a comic while others have voiced dissatisfaction that such an iconic vehicle might be lost from the property.|$|R
50|$|In 2002 BBC Horizon {{broadcast}} its {{failed attempt}} to win James Randi's $1 million prize to prove that a highly diluted substance <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> an effect. Prominent spokespersons {{on both sides of}} the debate were interviewed, including Benveniste.|$|R
50|$|Portman was homosexual, {{although}} newspapers never {{reported this}} during the mid-1950s when homosexuality was illegal in the UK. Newspapers refrained from identifying his sexuality throughout the 1960s when it <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> damaged his career. His partner was actor Knox Laing.|$|R
60|$|Even now, Abercromby {{might have}} {{retrieved}} his repulse, for, with 13,000 men still remaining, against 3300 unwounded Frenchmen, he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> easily {{forced them to}} surrender, by planting cannons on the heights, or by cutting off their communication and food.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{its small}} size, the {{viscosity}} of air is problematic for the insect, {{and even the}} smallest air currents are a large problem. Scientists expressed amazement that such a tiny animal <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> all the organs of a normal insect.|$|R
50|$|By {{relying on}} the ruling of another similar case Fantasy Sports Props v.

50|$|On Day 40, Cesena {{became the}} first team mathematically relegated to Serie C1 with its 2-1 loss at Treviso. Although Cesena <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> {{finished}} 19th at the time, at best {{it would have been}} 5 points behind 18th-placed Treviso, a condition that would have made playouts unnecessary.|$|R
5000|$|Spence {{discovered}} {{that even if}} education did not contribute anything to an employee's productivity, it <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> value to both the employer and employee. If the appropriate cost/benefit structure exists (or is created), [...] "good" [...] employees will buy more education in order to signal their higher productivity.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{criticism}} Franzen was uninvited from the televised book club dinner, and he apologized profusely. When Franzen was not invited back, {{he suggested that}} perhaps he and Winfrey <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> dinner but not on TV, but Winfrey was all booked up, and her spokesperson said she was moving on.|$|R

50|$|Example 4: If the U.S. Congress {{passes a}} bill, the president's {{signature}} of the bill is sufficient to make it law. Note that the case whereby {{the president did not}} sign the bill, e.g. through exercising a presidential veto, {{does not mean that the}} bill has not become law (it <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> become law through a congressional override).|$|R

He proved that he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> great power {{production}} at lower altitudes, hitting [...]305 with 44 home runs and 121 RBI. This made Galarraga the first player in Major League history to hit 40 or more homers in consecutive seasons for two different teams.|$|R
50|$|Lucy Kate Lowten (AKA: Catherine Huggins and Mrs W. H. Foley) died at Napier, New Zealand on 4 March 1887 and {{was buried}} in the Napier cemetery.

50|$|With {{just four}} games {{remaining}} in the league season, Dawu were in an impressive 3rd place, and <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> won the league. However, they took just one point from their last four matches and slumped to a 7th-placed finish. This poor end-of-season form almost dragged Dawu into the relegation zone, as they finished just four points clear of the two relegated teams.|$|R
25|$|The {{location}} of Muammar Gaddafi was unclear on 22 August; {{it was thought}} that he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> been staying in Tripoli, surrounded by remaining forces in his Bab al-Azizia compound, but this was yet to be determined. Another report had him in the Tajura cardiac hospital. Al Jazeera reported that Muammar Gaddafi allegedly had successfully resisted an attempt to arrest him at the hospital.|$|R
50|$|A {{restoration}} and {{renewal of the}} Palace of Westminster could well result in the temporary relocation of Parliament but a permanent relocation to a new building seems unlikely although the final hurdle of public reaction to the commitment of vast financial resources to the Westminster site <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> the potential to influence MPs and other groups known to be supportive of a permanent move.|$|R

30|$|Even though {{increasing}} {{government expenditures}} is not appropriate, {{that does not}} mean that the government has no other valid options. Adjustments to the structure of expenditures <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> a positive effect. By structuralizing expenditures and increasing governmental involvement in public services (such as spending on pensions, medication, education, and housing), disposable incomes could be increased, creating more demand for spending and providing further support for economic growth.|$|R
50|$|At season's end, Webber {{was third}} in the Drivers' Championship, behind Vettel and Alonso. He had led the {{championship}} until the , {{when he did not}} complete the race.

Dearheart is the daughter of the Clacks founder Robert Dearheart, though the company was taken away from her father and the other founders by tricky financial maneuvering. Because of this, she <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>useful</b> contacts amongst the clacks operators.|$|R
5|$|But they {{overlooked}} that inexpensive aspirin {{had become}} available in India {{and other places}} after October 1918, when the Bayer patent expired. In responding, Starko pointed to anecdotal evidence of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> been a factor for other high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.|$|R
5|$|In April 2015, Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate was {{considering}} {{whether or not}} to prosecute WCRC.

50|$|Complexity largely {{refers to}} the number of {{interacting}} or interconnected elements within a system that can make it difficult to predict the behavior of the system. But the definition of complexity <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> problems as system components can vary in terms of how many components there are in the system, number of relationships between them, and the nature of those relationships. Complexity may also be a function of the decision maker's ability.|$|R

50|$|One {{reason for}} the hearing {{problems}} these patients often experience {{is due to the}} head shadow effect. Newborn children with no hearing on one side but one normal ear <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> problems. Speech development could be delayed and difficulties to concentrate in school are common. More children with unilateral hearing loss have to repeat classes than their peers. Taking part in social activities could be a problem. Early aiding is therefore of utmost importance.|$|R
50|$|Saruman’s sound {{defeat at}} the Battle of the Hornburg and the {{destruction}} of his fortress rendered him incapable of causing the West any military harm, although he <b>still</b> <b>had</b> the power of his persuasive and commanding voice, with which he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> do (and did do) further harm. Had the Ents not destroyed Isengard, although Saruman's main army had been destroyed he <b>could</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> withstood a siege with his few remaining forces behind Isengard's normally impregnable walls, and bided his time until he could renew his strength. In the films by Peter Jackson, Saruman is stabbed by Wormtongue (who perishes from an arrow from Legolas) and falls to his death from the top of Orthanc.|$|R
