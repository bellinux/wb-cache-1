This tradition may have originated with King Andriantompokoindrindra, who is said to have ordered the first trano masina to be built on his tomb in honor of his memory.|$|E

6000|$|In Edinburgh, for a {{considerable}} time, Fleeming's family, to three generations, was united: Mr. and Mrs. Austin at Hailes, Captain and Mrs. Jenkin in the suburb of Merchiston, Fleeming himself in the city. It is not every family that could risk with safety such close inter-domestic dealings; but in this also Fleeming was particularly favoured. Even the two extremes, Mr. Austin and the Captain, drew together. It is pleasant to find {{that each of the}} old gentlemen set a high value on the good looks of the other, doubtless also on his own; and a fine picture they made as they walked the green terrace at Hailes, conversing by the hour. What they talked of is still a mystery to those who knew them; but Mr. Austin always declared that on these occasions he learned much. To both of these families of elders due service was paid of attention; to both, Fleeming's easy circumstances had brought joy; and the eyes of all were on the grandchildren. In Fleeming's scheme of duties, those of the family stood first; a man was first of all a child, nor did he cease to be so, but only took on added obligations, when he became in turn a father. The care of his parents was always a first thought with him, and their gratification his delight. And the care of his sons, as it was always a grave subject of study with him, and an affair never neglected, so it brought him a thousand satisfactions. [...] "Hard work they are," [...] as he once wrote, [...] "but what fit work!" [...] And again: [...] "O, it's a <b>cold</b> <b>house</b> where a dog is the only representative of a child!" [...] Not that dogs were despised; we shall drop across the name of Jack, the harum-scarum Irish terrier, ere we have done; his own dog Plato went up with him daily to his lectures, and still (like other friends) feels the loss and looks visibly for the reappearance of his master; and Martin the cat Fleeming has himself immortalised, to the delight of Mr. Swinburne, in the columns of the Spectator. Indeed, there was nothing in which men take interest, in which he took not some; and yet always most in the strong human bonds, ancient as the race and woven of delights and duties.|$|E

60|$|Indeed, my dear friend, {{you have}} a right to {{complain}} of me, whether or not we had any in thinking ourselves deeply injured creatures by your last silence. Yet when in your letter which came at last, you said, 'Write directly,' I meant to write directly; I did not take out my vengeance in a foregone malice, be very sure. Just at the time we were in a hard knot of uncertainties about Rome and Venice and Florence, and a <b>cold</b> <b>house</b> and a warm house; for instance we managed (that is I did, for altogether it was my fault) to take two apartments in the course of ten days, each for a term of six months, getting out of one of them by leaving the skirts of our garments, rent, literally, in the hand of the proprietor. You have heard most of this, I dare say, from Mr. Kenyon or my sisters. Now, too, you are aware of our being in Piazza Pitti, in a charmed circle of sun blaze. Our rooms are small, but of course as cheerful as being under the very eyelids of the sun must make everything; and we have a cook in the house who takes the office of traiteur on him and gives us English mutton chops at Florentine prices, both of us quite well and in spirits, and (though you never will believe this) happier than ever. For my own part, you know I need not say a word if it were not true, and I must say to you, who saw the beginning with us, that this end of fifteen months is just fifteen times better and brighter; the mystical 'moon' growing larger and larger till scarcely room is left for any stars at all: the only differences which have touched me being the more and more happiness. It would have been worse than unreasonable if in marrying I had expected one quarter of such happiness, and indeed I did not, to do myself justice, and every now and then I look round in astonishment and thankfulness together, yet with a sort of horror, seeing that this is not heaven after all. We live just as we did when you knew us, just as shut-up a life. Robert never goes anywhere except to take a walk with Flush, which isn't my fault, as you may imagine: he has not been out one evening of the fifteen months; but what with music and books and writing and talking, we scarcely know how the days go, it's such a gallop on the grass. We are going through some of old Sacchetti's novelets now: characteristic work for Florence, if somewhat dull elsewhere. Boccaccios can't be expected to spring up with the vines in rows, even in this climate. We got a newly printed addition to Savonarola's poems the other day, very flat and cold, they did not catch fire when he was burnt. The most poetic thing in the book is his face on the first page, with that eager, devouring soul in the eyes of it. You may suppose that I am able sometimes to go over to the gallery and adore the Raphaels, and Robert will tell you of the divine Apollino which you missed seeing in Poggio Imperiale, and which I shall be set face to face before, some day soon, I hope....|$|E

A modern greenhouse of 1200 m2 was built in 1965, with many improvements in 1971. Seminar rooms totaling 300 m2 and a research area of 150 m2 were added in 1987 and 1995 respectively.|$|R

40|$|Background: Living in <b>cold</b> <b>housing</b> {{conditions}} {{and risk of}} fuel poverty presents a range of physiological and psychosocial health risks. Limited research has specifically investigated the effects of fuel poverty on children and young people, and even less has been conducted with youth input into the research process. Methods: The Cool? Study used mixed methods, participatory action research carried out with youth researchers involved at all stages through questionnaire design, analysis, qualitative design, e-interviewing and dissemination of results. This article reports on results of an online survey of 656 adolescents aged 14 – 16 years completed at 17 schools in New Zealand. Sampling was based on selecting schools for invitation, with the probability of selection weighted proportional to school size, within strata defined by climate zone. Results from a small e-mail interview study of survey respondents who consented to follow-up are also reported. Results: The study found that {{almost half of the}} survey respondents (47 %) felt their home was sometimes cold during the winter; a further 40 % felt their home was often or always cold. More than two thirds of respondents (70 %) had shivered inside at least once during winter. Respondents {{were more likely to report}} key indicators of fuel poverty depending on their self-reported ethnicity, with Māori at increased risk. Living in private rental housing or state-owned housing also increased risk of fuel poverty compared to those in owner-occupied dwellings. Participants of email interviews expressed concern about the widespread problem of <b>cold</b> <b>housing</b> for youth and a desire for Government intervention. Conclusion: The integrated results confirm that <b>cold</b> <b>housing</b> and risk of fuel poverty are important problems for young people in New Zealand. Results contribute to the evidence-base for policy targeting of schemes such as the Government-sponsored retrofitting of insulation to households with dependent children...|$|R

40|$|Cold homes harm health. There is {{a growing}} {{knowledge}} and evidence base related to the direct negative impacts on morbidity and mortality of living in <b>cold</b> <b>housing.</b> We know for example that in children, cold homes are associated with poor infant weight gain, slower development, worse asthma, and more hospital admissions. Adolescents are five {{times more likely to}} suffer multiple mental health problems. Adults – particularly those who are vulnerable – suffer more heart disease, stroke and respiratory disease, their general health is worse and existing conditions are exacerbated by living in cold properties. Older people suffer worse mental health and higher mortality rates. Living in <b>cold</b> <b>housing</b> can also indirectly harm health. It afects children’s educational attainment, emotional wellbeing and resilience; limits the dietary opportunities and choices people make; and the impact of cold on dexterity leads to a higher risk of accidents and injuries. The Warm Homes, Warm Families research project adds to our knowledge about the complex interaction between cold homes and health by exploring factors influencing the ability of households with children with asthma to keep warm at home in winter and access help. The experience, knowledge, beliefs and values of adults living in households with children with asthma affect the choices they make. This work will help to design improved information and support to enable families to protect themselves better from the harm to health caused by <b>cold,</b> damp <b>housing.</b> This work is particularly important at a time when energy costs are spiralling upward and when many families are faced with very stark economic choices...|$|R
