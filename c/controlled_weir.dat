50|$|Reindeer Lake has {{a heavily}} {{indented}} shoreline and contains numerous small islands. On its eastern shore is {{the community of}} Kinoosao, at its northern end Brochet, Manitoba; and at its southern end, Southend, Saskatchewan; and Deep Bay, which covers an astrobleme which probably formed 100 million years ago. It drains mainly to the south, via the Reindeer River and a <b>controlled</b> <b>weir,</b> to the Churchill River and then east to Hudson Bay. Water flow out of the lake is regulated by the Whitesand Dam.|$|E
5000|$|The Satpula {{across the}} stream was {{built as a}} gate <b>controlled</b> <b>weir.</b> The total length of the {{structure}} is 79.5 m. It has been constructed in stone masonry. The eleven bays of the weir controlled by sluice gates cover a total length of 54.5 m. These eleven bays consist of eleven water tunnels (sluices), each 14.6 m in length, 3.2 m in height, and 2.2 - 2.9 m in width. These are located at different levels, with seven main bays at the lowest level. The balance two additional bays on each bank, on the far east and west sides, are at a higher level. The control arrangements seen now are {{in the form of}} gate grooves to operate vertical slide gates. When built, wooden vertical sluice gates made of heavy boards of size 16 cm in thickness, 3 m width, and more than 3 m in height, were operated by a rope and pulley arrangement to control flow of water; the wooden gates have since disintegrated but the gate groves are visible in each bay. The gates of the sluices were closed as a defensive measure against possible attack in the dry season when no storage remained in the dam. Each bay of the weir has an arched opening. On both banks of the weir identical towers (defensive bastions, projecting on the south and north sides) of 5.97 m) diameter, but with octagonal shape chambers, are built, which once functioned as madrasa (Islamic school of learning). Hence, the Satpula is also known as [...] "Madarsa". The second level sluice bays on both banks lead to arched corridors. The walls of the octagonal chambers have graceful decorations. The stream tapped by this weir, has been diverted now further east. The indication of the use of the sluices of the structure, either as a dam or for defense purposes, could be gauged from the platforms provided at the appropriate levels. Silt deposition in the storage area of the reservoir side at the southern end is also seen now.|$|E

The two PI controllers are defined, tuned and tested using a hydraulic unsteady flow simulation model, particularly suitable for canal control studies. The PI control parameters are tuned using optimization tools.

A MUSIC model analysis was performed to evaluate the expected runoff reduction associated with a LS-VFS receiving stormwater from a Brisbane residential subdivision.

This language is generated by a non-branching (and hence well-nested) 3 -MCFG {{as well as by}} a (non-well-nested) binary-branching 2 -MCFG; it follows that neither the class of well-nested 3 -MCFLs nor the class of 2 -MCFLs is included in <b>Weir’s</b> <b>control</b> language hierarchy, for which Palis and Shende proved an Ogden-like iteration theorem.

40|$|The {{fate and}} {{transport}} of mercury are of critical concern in lowland floodplains and wetlands worldwide, {{especially those with}} a history of upstream mining that increases the mobility of both dissolved and sediment-bound Hg in watersheds. A mass budget of total mercury (THg) quantifies sources and storage for particular areas - knowledge that is required for understanding of management options in lowland floodplains. In order to assess contaminant risk in the largest flood-control bypass, prime wetland, and restoration target in the Sacramento River basin, we estimated empirical relationships between THg, suspended sediment concentration (SSC), and streamflow (Q) for each of the major inputs and outputs using data from various publicly available sources. These relationships were improved by incorporating statistical representations of the dynamics of seasonal and intra-flood exhaustion (hysteresis) of sediment and mercury. Using continuous records of Q to estimate SSC suspended sediment flux and SSC to estimate THg flux, we computed the net transfer of sediment-adsorbed mercury through the Yolo Bypass over a decade, 1993 - 2003. Flood <b>control</b> <b>weirs</b> spilling Sacramento River floodwaters into the bypass deliver ~. 75 % of the water and ~. 50 % of the river's suspended sediment load, while one Coast Range tributary of the bypass, Cache Creek, contributes twice the THg load of the mainstem Sacramento. Although estimated sediment flux entering Yolo Bypass is balanced by efflux to the Sacramento/San Francisco Bay-Delta, there is much evidence of deposition and remobilization of sediment in Yolo Bypass during flooding. These factors point to the importance of the bypass as sedimentary reservoir and as an evolving substrate for biogeochemical processing of heavy metals. The estimates of mercury flux suggest net deposition of ~. 500. kg in the 24, 000. ha floodway over a decade, dominated by two large floods, representing a storage reservoir for this important contaminant. © 2011 Elsevier B.
