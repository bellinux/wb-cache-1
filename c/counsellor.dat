50|$|While the {{establishment}} of a regency carries with it the suspension of the monarch from the personal discharge of the royal functions, when <b>Counsellors</b> of State are appointed, both the sovereign and the <b>counsellors</b> can—the <b>Counsellors</b> within the limits of their delegation of authority—discharge the royal functions. Thus, the monarch can give instructions to the <b>Counsellors</b> of State or even personally discharge a certain royal prerogative when the <b>counsellors</b> are in place.

40|$|In this study, {{an attempt}} was made to {{determine}} if alcoholism <b>counsellors</b> tend to view their clients' wives negatively. For this purpose, a self-administered questionnaire was designed. Of the 284 questionnaires mailed to <b>counsellors</b> in Quebec, Ontario and New York State, 176 were returned. Several statistical tests were used to determine which factor(s) affected their opinion. It was found that American <b>counsellors</b> and <b>counsellors</b> who are recovering alcoholics tend to agree with the disturbed personality theory, adopt the codependence concept more readily, and view wives of alcoholics as more pathological than do the Canadian <b>counsellors</b> and the <b>counsellors</b> of a professional background.

How can the current education for the student <b>counsellors</b> be supplemented? The analysis of the interviews with six <b>counsellors</b> in Stockholm's administrative province showed that even uneducated <b>counsellors</b> use the same counselling methods as the educated ones.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to offer {{guidelines}} for <b>counsellors</b> who work with rehabilitation groups of patients with chronic pain. The sample involved nine <b>counsellors</b> engaged in a multidisciplinary pain management programme. Two focus group interviews were conducted. Data was analysed using qualitative content analysis.

The <b>counsellors</b> reported that knowledge concerning self-awareness, theoretical frameworks and counselling techniques was important. Personal learning included: group leadership, teamwork, grasping the inside story and obtaining supervision. The results show how important it is to have trained <b>counsellors</b> who are well prepared to prevent and deal with challenging group processes. <b>Counsellors</b> need to understand the concept of pain and be acquainted with cognitive behavioural framework and group processes. The results indicate that <b>counsellors</b> perceive regular supervision as supportive and is likely to promote good team functioning...|$|R

The overall outcome of the study was that the interviewed school <b>counsellors</b> felt {{that they did not have}} good opportunities to work preventively as the Education Act requires.

40|$|The <b>counsellor's</b> role {{in primary}} school is very diverse, often also {{conflicting}} and ambiguous. Depending on the school's organizational structure {{it is often}} also non-autonomous and subordinate to the administrative needs of the school.

This work represents the <b>counsellor's</b> involvement in life and work of the primary school and complexity of his work. Further, I define stress, its symptoms and consequences, and describe more and less functional strategies of coping with stressful situations. With <b>counsellor's</b> work stress, I mainly focus on professional and organizational sources of stress.

40|$|While much {{supervision}} occurs within organisations {{in which}} <b>counsellors</b> work, {{it seems that}} the issues facing supervision in organisations where <b>counsellors</b> are the main professional group are different from those in organisations where <b>counsellors</b> are {{only a small percentage of}} the employees. One field in which <b>counsellors</b> are a minority profession is in education. For example, Education Queensland has approximately 55, 000 employees, 400 of whom are guidance officers (the term used for school <b>counsellors</b> in this organisation). <b>Counsellors</b> therefore represent less than one per cent of the total number of employees, and proportions of this order would be expected in most, if not all, school systems. Using the supervision of guidance officers in Education Queensland as an example, this chapter will explore issues in an organisation where <b>counsellors</b> constitute a minority profession. An historical background will be presented first, followed by a discussion of the issues inherent in the provision of supervision in such an organisation. Examples of supervision practices will then be provided. An historical background to school counselling and supervision Education Queensland has employed school <b>counsellors</b> as guidance officers since 1948 (Logan & Clarke, 1984). Since 1988 a senior guidance position (now titled senior guidance officer) had responsibility for the 'supervision, support, development and co-ordination functions associated with guidance and counsellin...|$|R

Sixteen <b>counsellors</b> who offer HIV pre-post-test counselling were identified from the preliminary field work, of these, 9 <b>counsellors</b> who reported they had not presented for HIV/AIDS testing were identified and 7 eventually participated in the study. The participants were active <b>counsellors,</b> 27 through 46 years of age, who provided HIV pre-post-test counselling services. A purposive sampling technique was employed to select the participants. The non-scheduled structured interview was employed for data collection while the cross case method was used to analyze the data. The study found that the participants possessed negative attitude towards undergoing voluntary HIV/AIDS testing though they acknowledged the importance of HIV/AIDS test. The participants identified fear of being HIV/AIDS positive, lack of confidentiality and knowledge of HIV/AIDS as barriers to their undergoing HIV/AIDS test. Being counselled by a professional counsellor/ psychologist or someone living with HIV/AIDS, feeling too sick or being pregnant were highlighted as factors that may facilitate their undergoing HIV/AIDS test.
