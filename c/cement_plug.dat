40|$|AbstractA {{hypothetical}} CO 2 {{storage site}} {{that has some}} abandoned wells located near the injection well is considered. Generally, <b>cement</b> <b>plugs</b> are set to cover or isolate porous or productive formations and to isolate usable groundwater from hydrocarbons. When CO 2 is injected into a reservoir, supercritical CO 2 or dissolved CO 2 spreads out in the reservoir. This dissolved CO 2 can react chemically with <b>cement</b> seals (<b>plugs</b> and casing <b>cement)</b> in abandoned wells. As a result, minerals in the <b>cement</b> seals (<b>plugs</b> and casing <b>cement)</b> may alter to form other minerals or mineral phases. The first simulations concerning migration of supercritical CO 2 and dissolved CO 2 in a saline aquifer and a depleted gas field reservoir, were carried out using TOUGH 2. The following temperatures and depths of reservoir were selected: 50 °C at E. L. - 1, 000 m, 60 °C at E. L. - 1, 500 m and 70 °C at E. L. - 2, 000 m. Secondly, geochemical reactions of <b>cement</b> seals (<b>plugs</b> and casing <b>cement)</b> were simulated. The results of reservoir simulations were used as boundary conditions for the geochemical calculation of cement seals. Geochemical simulation of the reactions yielded the extent (length) of alteration of <b>cement</b> seals (<b>plugs</b> and casing <b>cement)</b> after long time periods; for example, the alteration length of cement seals after 1, 000 years was about one meter. This length is short enough so that the usable <b>cement</b> seals (<b>plugs</b> and casing <b>cement)</b> of abandoned well are {{able to continue to}} isolate CO 2 in the reservoir from the upper aquifer...|$|R

40|$|The {{release of}} various {{penicillins}} and other antibiotics from two brands of polymerised bone cement {{has been studied}} in vitro and in vivo in mice. Bone <b>cement</b> <b>plugs</b> containing antibiotics demonstrated antibacterial activity {{as a result of}} diffusion of antibiotic from the plugs into the surrounding medium. With all antibiotics tested, from 25 to 10 per cent of the antibiotic in the cement was released in vitro in active form within twenty-four hours. Most of the activity appeared within three hours of the start of the test, but in some cases low levels of activity were detected after four days. Antibiotic <b>cement</b> <b>plugs</b> implanted in mice and rats produced low concentrations of antibiotic in the blood up to two hours after implantation, but activity was seldom detected subsequently. In general, penicillins and non-penicillin antibiotics showed similar diffusion characteristics, and the pattern of release in vitro and in vivo was consistent with the leaching of antibiotic from, or near, the surface of the bone cement.

40|$|AbstractPotential {{migration}} of CO 2 from subsurface reservoirs along wells is generally {{recognized as the}} major hazard associated with long-term storage of CO 2 in geological formations due to possible chemical and mechanical impact on wellbore cement or casing steel. Many storage projects involve the presence of pre-existing wellbores, penetrating the prospective storage container. Because of their inaccessibility, the main risk is associated with previously abandoned wells. The actual operations {{at the time of}} abandonment determine the suitability of these wells for future CO 2 storage operations. Past and present oil and gas well abandonment regulations, prescribing minimum requirements for the use of <b>cement</b> <b>plugs</b> to prevent inter-zonal communication, form a good proxy to assess the general status of abandoned wells. A high-level review of current abandonment regulations showed that required plug lengths vary greatly between different regions, from a minimum of 15  m in Alberta to 100  m in some European countries. Many experimental studies have been performed on degradation of wellbore cement under influence of aqueous CO 2. Considering that diffusion of CO 2 in the cement matrix forms the rate-controlling step in cement degradation, extrapolation of the results of these studies shows that up to a few meters of cement may be affected in 10, 000 years. In spite of the significant variation between the evaluated regulations, currently prescribed plug lengths seem appropriate for safe storage of CO 2 with respect to reported laboratory degradation rates. This implies that mechanical integrity of <b>cement</b> <b>plugs</b> and the quality of its placement probably is of more significance than chemical degradation of properly placed abandonment plugs...|$|R
30|$|The Wilson no. 1 is a {{wildcat well}} drilled {{to a final}} depth of 3672  m in 1981 at the Geysers {{geothermal}} field. At the end of drilling operations, steam entry was registered near the well bottom with pressures rising up to 94 bars and high amounts of harmful gases such as CO 2 and H 2 S. A casing collapse was registered in two places in an interval between depths of 1163 and 1166  m {{as well as between}} 1837 and 1877  m. Additionally, incidents of stuck pipe occurred and fishing operations were necessary. The maximum temperature estimated using fluid inclusions from a depth of 2980  m was approximately 400  °C.

50|$|DOGGR also {{maintains}} {{a database of}} active wells, expired wells, surveyed lands and leases on California land, coastal waters (0-3 miles) and federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). When a well is no longer needed, either because the oil or gas reservoir becomes depleted, or because no oil or gas was found (called a dry-hole), the well is plugged and abandoned. A well is plugged by placing cement in the well-bore or casing at certain intervals as specified in California laws or regulations. The purpose of the cement is to seal the wellbore or casing and prevent fluid from migrating between underground rock layers. Cement plugs are required to be placed across the oil or gas reservoir (zone plug), across the base-of-fresh-water (BFW plug), and at the surface (surface plug). Other cement plugs may be required {{at the bottom of}} a string of open casing (shoe plug), on top of tools that may become stuck down hole (junk plug), on top of cut casing (stub plug), or anywhere else where a <b>cement</b> <b>plug</b> may be needed.

Press releases from Transocean state the platform had historically been used for deeper wells, including the deepest underwater gas and oil well in history at 35055 ft in 2009.

40|$|A {{reference}} {{design and}} operational {{procedures for the}} disposal of high-level radioactive waste in deep boreholes have been developed and documented. The design and operations are feasible with currently available technology and meet existing safety and anticipated regulatory requirements. Objectives of the reference design include providing a baseline for more detailed technical analyses of system performance and serving {{as a basis for}} comparing design alternatives. Numerous factors suggest that deep borehole disposal of high-level radioactive waste is inherently safe. Several lines of evidence indicate that groundwater at depths of several kilometers in continental crystalline basement rocks has long residence times and low velocity. High salinity fluids have limited potential for vertical flow because of density stratification and prevent colloidal transport of radionuclides. Geochemically reducing conditions in the deep subsurface limit the solubility and enhance the retardation of key radionuclides. A non-technical advantage that the deep borehole concept may offer over a repository concept is that of facilitating incremental construction and loading at multiple perhaps regional locations. The disposal borehole would be drilled to a depth of 5, 000 m using a telescoping design and would be logged and tested prior to waste emplacement. Waste canisters would be constructed of carbon steel, sealed by welds, and connected into canister strings with high-strength connections. Waste canister strings of about 200 m length would be emplaced in the lower 2, 000 m of the fully cased borehole and be separated by bridge and <b>cement</b> <b>plugs.</b> Sealing of {{the upper part of the}} borehole would be done with a series of compacted bentonite seals, <b>cement</b> <b>plugs,</b> <b>cement</b> seals, cement plus crushed rock backfill, and bridge plugs.

40|$|The {{petroleum}} industry constantly works to optimize operational aspects within drilling. The cost to {{drill a well}} is a parameter all companies want to minimize. To do this new technology and new methods are used to optimize the drilling process. Drilling the shoetrack is a process where components {{in the bottom of}} the casing are drilled out. The components include different equipment used when cementing the casing. Drilling the shoetrack can be a time consuming process, generating large cost and problems for the operators. The drilling of the shoetrack includes many factors, making it a complex situation. A study of the drilling parameters will help to optimize this process. Studies of the drilling parameters are expected to reduce the operational cost and time when drilling the shoetrack. Drilling data from 143 runs were given in order to get a better overview over the problems occurring, and to show were most of the time is used. Special <b>cementing</b> <b>plugs</b> are used to displace the cement slurry and give surface pressure indications during the cementing operation. After the casing is cemented into place, all the equipment in the shoetrack needs to be drilled out in order to reach the next open hole section. The inclination of the wells plotted against the total time to drill the shoetrack, shows that the more deviated a well is, the more time consuming the shoetrack drill out process is. The study further shows that the component in the shoetrack taking the most time to drill is the landing collar, this applies for 6 of 7 casing sizes studied. The landing collar is a component used in the shoetrack when the cementing operation takes place. The <b>cement</b> <b>plugs</b> that displace the cement when pumping will land and seal inside and on top of the landing collar, this will give surface pressure indications, indicating that the cementing job is complete. The use of different bit did not give any big difference when studying all the drilling runs, so for drilling the shoetrack, it is the drilling parameters that account for most of the effect. The shoetrack drillout of the 10 ¾” liners has shown to take too much time. The focus was therefore directed towards this casing size. A total of 15 wells in this casing size were selected, where Halliburton was the provider of the shoetrack equipment. Further, feet-by-feet data were examined, containing drilling parameters as weight on bit, rotation speed, torque and flowrate. The study included both single stage cemented liners and two stage cemented liners. The study clearly shows that drilling the <b>cementing</b> <b>plug</b> and lading collar, is the process taking most of the time. Since the landing collar took most of the time of the shoetrack drillout, a deeper studied was performed. For the single stage cemented liners a trend was seen when studying the flow rate up against the total time to drill the shoetrack. An increased flow gave better drillout times. For the WOB, no trend was seen. No trends were seen when studying the total drilling time up against WOB and flowrate for the two stage cemented liners. The materials studied for the shoetrack of 10 ¾” liners was relatively soft materials, consisting of aluminium, rubber, plastic and cement. Connecting the time to drill the landing collar up against the average values of WOB, Torque, flowrate and revolution speed gave some interesting results. The more weight and torque applied the more time the drilling of the landing collar took. The flowrate and rotation speed did not show a large effect in the drill out times...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{demonstrate}} how seismic waves propagate in wells, and to investigate the potential of using borehole seismic {{as an alternative to}} conventional <b>cement</b> <b>plug</b> verification. An alternative verification method might be necessary to perform full plug and abandonment (P&A) operations from riserless light well intervention (RLWI) vessels. Testing, verification and monitoring of technical barrier elements are important to maintain well integrity. The barrier situation has to be kept under control in all phases of a well's lifetime. The focus on long-term integrity is increasing as more wells are getting ready to be plugged and abandoned. New and more effective P&A solutions are desired by the industry. Rigless P&A operations would save time and cost, but current technology does not allow RLWI vessels to do the entire operation. The work in this thesis is based on previous work where it is suggested how to place cement plugs in a well using a vessel. To act {{as a part of the}} barrier envelope, the plug needs to be verified and tested according to the NORSOK D- 010 requirements. Tagging is often used for <b>cement</b> <b>plug</b> verification. Conventional tagging operations are not possible from RLWI vessels, and this thesis suggests borehole seismic as an alternative solution for <b>cement</b> <b>plug</b> verification. The alternative verification method is based on generating pressure waves using a seismic source, and detecting the reflection from the <b>cement</b> <b>plug</b> using receivers run on wireline. By doing this it might be possible to verify both the top of the plug and the cement integrity. To investigate the wave propagation and reflections from the plug, well models were created in MATLAB. The models were imported to the Madagscar software, and a 2 D finite difference method was used to model the wave propagation. The wave response from different <b>cement</b> <b>plug</b> scenarios are simulated by adjusting the models and input parameters. These scenarios include plugs with varying degree of cement settling and mud contamination. To confine the simulation time and to avoid numerical instabilities, the model had to be simplified. This has increased the uncertainty in the results. Using the simulation result, the depth of the top of the plug and the wave velocity in the cement were calculated with small errors. Knowing the cement velocity might make it possible to determine the grade of cement hydration. When mud contaminated the top of the plug, the top was not easily identified. The precision of the results is dependent on the frequencies used in the simulations. Tube waves are expected to have great importance when using borehole seismic for plug verification. The result could not identify these types of waves. A reason for this might be that the modeling is in 2 D while the well is 3 D. To make final conclusions on the potential of the alternative verification method, new simulation tools fitted for well modeling should be developed. Field experiments could also give valuable results. The optimal frequency range for <b>cement</b> <b>plug</b> verification has to be determined through a more detailed study. Solving the verification challenge is only one step on the way towards completely rigless P&A operations. Remaining challenges include problems related to tubing removal, logging behind several casing strings, and control line identification and removal. </p...|$|E

40|$|Deficient sealing in {{the well}} <b>cement</b> <b>plugs</b> and annulus due to {{mechanical}} fracturing is an important risk of CO 2 leakage from the reservoir to others permeable layers and the surface. Such situation was reproduced at laboratory scale {{in order to determine}} the hydro-chemical control on the fracture permeability. Specifically, we investigated the effect of CO 2 rich-brine flowing through fractured Portland cements at T = 60 °C and P = 10 MPa and variable flow rates. We showed that carbonation process is dominant and induces permeability decrease and leakage mitigation for extremely low flow rate whereas for high flow rate injection the permeability remains constant due to the precipitation of a low density secondary Si-rich phase which maintains the initial fracture aperture. At intermediate flow rate the hydraulic aperture can increase due to the densification of the material triggered by the net precipitation of low porosity calcite. These results emphasize that more complex behaviors than those considered from batch experiments may take place in the vicinity of flowing fractures. Specifically, the redissolution of the neoformed calcite as well as the development of amorphous phases, both controlled by the CO 2 -rich brine renewing rate in the fracture may prevent the healing fracture...|$|R
40|$|Long-lasting <b>cement</b> <b>plugging</b> of wells {{is crucial}} for {{successful}} CO 2 storage in underground reservoirs. It requires a profoundly improved understanding {{of the behavior of}} fractured cement under realistic subsurface conditions including elevated temperature, high pressure and the presence of CO 2 saturated brine. Here we report computed X-ray tomography studies on the effects of CO 2 on cement. More specifically, we have exposed cured Portland G cement samples with pre-made microchannels mimicking fractures to CO 2 saturated brine at elevated pressure (100 bars) and room temperature. The microchannels were observed to get filled with calcite (CaCO 3) during the CO 2 exposure. The extent of this self-healing was dependent on the diameter of the leakage path, with narrower channels more readily getting clogged. Chemical simulations taking into account the cement composition, CO 2 availability, pH, pressure and temperature gave results consistent with our conceptual understanding of how the differences in dissolution/precipitation profiles in the cement may result from the availability of CO 2. In particular, the modelling provides an explanation why calcite precipitates preferentially in the channels rather than on the external cement sample surfaces. We conclude that the localized precipitation can be ascribed to higher pH inside the cavities compared to near the external surfaces, owing to long diffusion distances giving a locally limited CO 2 supply within the voids...|$|R

40|$|When {{oil and gas}} wells {{reach the}} end of their {{production}} life, they need to be permanently plugged and abandoned. The requirements for a permanent barrier state that it must cover the entire cross-section of the wellbore, including all annuli. This thesis evaluates a new method of establishing a cross-sectional barrier in areas with poor, non-sealing annular cement. The traditional method is to mill away the section with poor cement and set an open hole <b>cement</b> <b>plug,</b> but due to the ECD effect of milling fluids, this is not always desirable. In some formations on the Gullfaks field, the operational pressure window is too small for section milling. An alternative solution was therefore tried out on a well that needed plugging. This method, referred to as punch and squeeze, consisted of perforating the section of poorly cemented casing and squeezing cement into the annulus. In this thesis, the equipment and techniques used are presented and evaluated, along with general theory relevant to plugging and abandonment. On Gullfaks, two punch and squeeze techniques were used. In the first, cement was pumped through a packer plug and squeezed into the perforations. The second technique involved setting a balanced <b>cement</b> <b>plug</b> over the perforations, and squeezing this plug into the perforations. The main conclusions are that the technique using a packer plug is safer with regards to well control, involves less waiting on cement and gives a better annular seal than the balanced plug alternative. Also, a cement evaluation log should be run before the squeeze jobs are performed, and the log results should be used when determining where to perforate. All things considered, {{it was found that the}} punch and squeeze method can succeed in creating a length of cross-sectional cement, but still involves some uncertainty and the technique can be further optimized...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} process and rate of {{carbonation}} reaction of Class A wellbore cement exposed to CO 2 -saturated solution at confined conditions similar to those employed in geological storage of CO 2. The main goal was to investigate whether reaction improves or degrades the sealing/healing capacity of fractured Type A <b>cement</b> <b>plugs.</b> Batch reaction experiments were performed {{for up to three}} months, on both intact and fractured Class A Portland cement cylinders, at a constant confining pressure of 30 MPa, a temperature of 80 °C and a CO 2 pressure of 10 MPa. The experiments were carried out on water-saturated samples, exposing them to the supercritical CO 2 at one end. All samples were jacketed in sleeves to seal them from the high pressure confining medium. The results indicate that cement carbonation front advanced in time, leading to a densification of the material. Extrapolation of the reaction rates to 1 -year period indicates a carbonation depth of about 1. 38 mm, and about 7. 56 mm after 30 years of exposure to CO 2 -saturated solution. Thermogravimetric analyses, Scanning Electron Microscopy observations and permeability measurements indicate that carbonation of wellbore cement leads to a decrease of the porosity of the material on the reaction front and moreover, has the potential for healing pre-existent fractures and for improving the sealing properties of good-quality cement samples in time, at reservoir conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{objectives are}} designed to realize the application of superabsorbent polymer (SAP) in well <b>cement</b> to <b>plug</b> microcrack. Gypsum-chitosan-gypsum coated SAP is proposed. Percolation theory is used to research plugging microcrack mechanism. According to the exact analytical solution of square plane percolation threshold, dosage threshold of coated SAP microspheres is calculated as 28. 40 %, which can deliver the plugging of microcrack. The method of manufacturing quantitative microcrack is established, and self-designed instrument is employed to test plugging performance. The results show the ability of plugging microcrack when the dosage of coated SAP microsphere {{is higher than the}} threshold...|$|R
40|$|A cement {{borehole}} {{plug and}} a crushed tuff/bentonite clay mixture borehole plug were tested insitu in highly welded tuff. The hydraulic {{performance of the}} <b>cement</b> <b>plug</b> was evaluated through steady-state and transient hydraulic tests with a hydraulic conductivity {{in the range of}} 10 ⁻¹⁰ cm/s. A crushed tuff/bentonite mixture plug was tested through a steady-state flow test with a measured hydraulic conductivity of 10 ⁻⁹ cm/s. The plug was installed in a fractured borehole which was grouted to reduce the overall rockmass permeability. Installation procedures were evaluated in the laboratory prior to field installation. Installation of the cement seal with a bailer indicated seal degradation with water present in the borehole. Degradation appeared as piping, both internal and along the interface, and mixing of the cement with the water. Tests on the mixture seal indicated the need for homogeneous placement and adequate compaction to resist internal water piping and channelling...|$|E
40|$|We {{reviewed}} prospectively cemented stem revision in 106 {{patients with}} severe femoral endosteal bone lysis without infection. Bone grafts {{were not used}} {{in any of the}} patients. The minimum follow-up was three years (mean 6 years 4 months). At the last review 76. 4 % of the patients were free of pain and 17. 9 % had only mild or occasional discomfort; radiographs showed well-fixed stable stems in 101 (95. 3 %). An intramedullary <b>cement</b> <b>plug</b> was used at revision to improve stability in 97. 7 %. There was new endosteal osteolysis after revision in 17 patients; only two had severe changes. Seven hips (6. 6 %) required a second revision; only four of these (3. 8 %) were for stem loosening. Survivorship of the revised stem, using radiological evidence of stem loosening as the end point, was 95. 8 % at seven years. The results of stem revision arthroplasty using cement in the presence of massive endosteal cavitation are satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|During natural {{infection}} with {{the agent of}} Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, spirochetes are delivered with vector saliva, which contains anti-inflammatory and antihemostatic activities. We show here that the saliva of ixodid ticks reduces polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) adhesion via downregulation of 2 -integrins and decreases the efficiency of PMN in the uptake and killing of spirochetes. Inhibition of integrin adhesion and signaling reduces anti-inflammatory functions of PMN. These effects may favor the initial survival of spiro-chetes in vivo. Lyme disease is caused by {{infection with}} the spirochete Bor-relia burgdorferi and {{is characterized by the}} skin lesion ery-thema migrans, which may be followed by carditis, neurological symptoms, and arthritis (12). In a natural infection, spirochetes are delivered via an ixodid tick vector in the presence of saliva and are contained in a <b>cement</b> <b>plug</b> at the inoculation site (1). Arthropod saliva contains potent anti-inflammatory and anti-hemostatic activities and promotes a higher spirochete burden in the host (7, 21, 29) ...|$|E
40|$|The Long-Term Test of Buffer Material (LOT) is {{underway}} in the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory in Sweden {{to test the}} buffer material for nuclear waste disposal. The test parcels contain prefabricated bentonite blocks placed around a copper tube. A heater {{is placed in the}} lower part of the copper tube in order to simulate the heating effect of the spent fuel. The parcels are 300 mm in a diameter and placed in 4 m-long vertical boreholes in granitic rock at a depth of 450 m. This report concerns the chemical studies performed on the parcel A 2, which was excavated after about five years of experiment period. Two sample blocks were taken from the hot part of the parcel for studies. One of them was without additives while in the other one, <b>cement</b> <b>plugs</b> had been placed. In the block without additives the water content, which was close to the heater 28 – 30 wt % of the dry bentonite, increased to 32 – 33 wt % close to the rock. The total concentrations of dissolving chloride and sulphate in bentonite were determined by dispersing bentonite samples in deionized water. It was obvious that sulphate had redistributed and precipitated close to the heater during the experiment. The initial chloride concentration of bentonite had increased during the experiment approximately by a factor of ten. The increase in the chloride concentration was caused by chloride in the saturating groundwater...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} called Downhole Tubing Disposal {{developed}} by Oilfield Innovations for performing rigless permanent plug and abandonment is presented. Instead of pulling the production tubing, the tubing is weakened with longitudinal cuts which enables crushing of the tubing into the available liquid {{space of the}} constraining casing, effectively providing an unobstructed casing length where <b>cement</b> <b>plugs</b> can be set. By eliminating the requirement for a drilling rig, significant cost savings can be achieved. Evaluation of a full-scale experiment with a 2 3 / 8 ” tubing is given, and the plans for conducting a full-scale experiment with 4 ½” tubing is presented and discussed. Furthermore, a small-scale experiment was performed with the main objective being investigation {{of the influence of}} cutting pattern and radial clearance between compaction tube and constraint. The discussions from the three experiments are combined and further developed in terms of a real case of Downhole Tubing Disposal. No studies on chaotic crushing of constrained tubes have been found in the literature except for an experiment conducted by the inventors of Downhole Tubing Disposal. The data on the matter were therefore limited, which motivated the small-scale experiment. This experiment clearly shows that weakening a tube with longitudinal cuts reduces its axial compressive strength, and an increasing number of cuts further reduces this strength. Moreover, the compaction ratio increased significantly at moderate loads when more than two cuts were used. Calculations revealed that while a smaller constraining tube gave a reduced compaction ratio, the occupied cross-sectional area of the constraining tube increased at high loads. At moderate loads, the occupied cross-sectional area was identical for the different constraining tubes...|$|R
40|$|Periapical lesion is {{a general}} term used to {{describe}} the periapical inflammatory process that occurs in response to the invasion of micro-organisms in the root canal system as well as inflamed vital pulp. This phenomenon necessitates endodontic intervention and if the necrosis has occurred prior to tooth maturation, wide patency of the apical foramen requires some treatment modalities such as apexification or apical plug. Orthodontic treatment, on the other hand, is cautiously done for previously traumatized teeth due to increased risk for necrosis of the compromised tooth. This article tends to review the successful treatment process with calcium-enriched mixture (CEM) <b>cement</b> apical <b>plug</b> for an immature previously traumatized incisor tooth with an extensive periapical lesion, which was under orthodontic treatment as well...|$|R
