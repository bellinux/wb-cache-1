5000|$|Fed-batch culture is, in the {{broadest}} sense, defined as an operational technique in biotechnological processes where one or more nutrients (substrates) are fed (supplied) to the bioreactor during cultivation and in which the product(s) remain in the bioreactor {{until the end of}} the run. [...] An alternative description of the method is that of a culture in which [...] "a base medium supports initial cell culture and a feed medium is added to prevent nutrient depletion". [...] It is also a type of semi-batch culture. In some cases, all the nutrients are fed into the bioreactor. The advantage of the fed-batch culture is that one can <b>control</b> <b>concentration</b> of fed-substrate in the culture liquid at arbitrarily desired levels (in many cases, at low levels).|$|E

5000|$|Different {{views on}} Ramakrishna's tantric sadhana have been expressed. The Tantra sadhana {{consisted}} of the [...] "right-handed path" [...] consisting of Kularnava, Mahanirvana and Kamalakala Vilasa involving celibate vegetarian lifestyle, japa, breath <b>control,</b> <b>concentration,</b> meditation {{and a set of}} heterodox practices which include {{but are not limited to}} the Vamachara—termed as [...] "left-handed path", which involves drinking wine, eating meat, and sexual intercourse. Depending on an aspirant's disposition, Tantra prescribes a particular method for spiritual practice. In general, the Tantras classify people into three major groups pasu (animal), vira (hero), divya (godlike). According to Saradananda, Ramakrishna was in the vira stage during the practice of vamachara. Elizabeth U. Harding writes that the Tantra practices are aimed at rousing the Kundalini and piercing the six chakras. Harding argues that Tantra is one of the paths for God-realization and cannot be branded as sensualism.|$|E
50|$|Sport {{psychology}} is a specialization within psychology {{that seeks to}} understand psychological/mental factors that affect performance in sports, physical activity and exercise and apply these to enhance individual and team performance. The sport psychology approach differs from the coaches and players perspective. Coaches tend to narrow their focus and energy towards the end-goal. They {{are concerned with the}} actions that lead to the win, as opposed to the sport psychologist who tries to focus the players thoughts on just achieving the win. Sport psychology trains players mentally to prepare them, whereas coaches tend to focus mostly on physical training. Sport psychology deals with increasing performance by managing emotions and minimizing the psychological effects of injury and poor performance. Some of the most important skills taught are goal setting, relaxation, visualization, self-talk awareness and <b>control,</b> <b>concentration,</b> using rituals, attribution training, and periodization. The principles and theories may be applied to any human movement or performance tasks (e.g., playing a musical instrument, acting in a play, public speaking, motor skills). Usually, experts recommend that students be trained in both kinesiology (i.e., sport and exercise sciences, physical education) and counseling.|$|E
