5000|$|The first <b>CFast</b> cards {{reached the}} market in late 2009. [...] At CES 2009, Pretec showed a 32 GB <b>CFast</b> card and {{announced}} that they should reach the market within a few months. Delock began distributing <b>CFast</b> cards in 2010, offering several card readers with USB 3.0 and eSATAp (power over eSATA) ports to support <b>CFast</b> cards.|$|E
50|$|The <b>CFast</b> 2.0 {{specification}} {{was released}} {{in the second quarter}} of 2012, updating the electrical interface to SATA 3.0 (600 MByte/s). As of 2014, the only product employing <b>CFast</b> 2.0 cards was the Arri Amira digital production camera, allowing frame rates of up to 200 fps; a <b>CFast</b> 2.0 adapter for the Arri Alexa/XT camera was also released.|$|E
50|$|The {{cards are}} not {{backward}} compatible with CompactFlash or <b>CFast</b> cards. XQD and <b>CFast</b> were both {{designed as a}} replacement of the then-16-year-old (in 2010) CompactFlash standard.|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{observe the}} changes in {{oxidative}} stress in type 2 diabetic(T 2 DM) patients after gastric bypass,and investigate the mechanism of gastric bypass treatment for T 2 DM. Methods Thirty T 2 DM patients who underwent gastric bypass(T 2 DM group) and thirty healthy subjects(control group) were included in present study from Aug. 2009 to Apr. 2010. Values of fasting plasma glucose(FPG), 2 -hour postprandial plasma glucose(2 hPG),glycosylated hemoglobin(HbA 1 <b>c),fasting</b> plasma insulin(FIns),superoxide dismutase(SOD),malondialdehyde(MDA) and glutathione peroxidase(GSH-PX) were determined in T 2 DM group before surgery and 1, 3, 6 months after surgery. All the parameters were determined once in control group. Results Compared with control group,MDA was significantly higher(3. 6 ± 1. 3 vs 2. 2 ± 0. 7 μmol/L,P < 0. 01),and SOD and GSH-PX were significantly lower(45. 2 ± 18. 8 vs 87. 6 ± 20. 4 kU/L,P < 0. 01; 53. 6 ± 16. 8 vs 78. 9 ± 15. 6 mmol/L,P < 0. 01) in T 2 DM group. Compared with the preoperative values,the MDA decreased significantly(P < 0. 05),and SOD and GSH-PX increased significantly(P < 0. 01) in T 2 DM group 3 months after operation. Compared with preoperative values,FPG, 2 hPG and HbA 1 c decreased significantly(P < 0. 01) in T 2 DM group one month after operation. Compared with the values one month after operation, 2 hPG and HbA 1 c decreased significantly(P < 0. 01,P < 0. 05) 3 months after operation. Values of HOMA-IR decreased significantly from one month to six months after surgery(P < 0. 01). Conclusions Oxidative stress can be improved markedly after gastric bypass in T 2 DM patients. It {{may be one of}} the mechanisms of suceessful treatment of T 2 DM with gastric bypass...|$|R
50|$|On 8 April 2015, Canon Inc. {{announced}} the XC10 video camera, which also {{makes use of}} <b>CFast</b> cards. Blackmagic Design also announced that its URSA Mini will use <b>CFast</b> 2.0.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional CompactFlash cards use the Parallel ATA interface, but in 2008, {{a variant}} of CompactFlash, <b>CFast</b> was announced. <b>CFast</b> (also known as CompactFast) {{is based on the}} Serial ATA interface.|$|E
50|$|A {{variant of}} CompactFlash known as <b>CFast</b> {{is based on}} the Serial ATA bus, rather than the Parallel ATA/IDE bus for which all {{previous}} versions of CompactFlash are designed. <b>CFast</b> is also known as CompactFast.|$|E
50|$|<b>CFast</b> {{cards are}} not {{physically}} or electrically compatible with CompactFlash cards. However, since SATA can emulate the PATA command protocol, existing CompactFlash software drivers can be used, although writing new drivers to use AHCI instead of PATA emulation will almost always result in significant performance gains. <b>CFast</b> cards use a female 7-pin SATA data connector, {{and a female}} 17-pin power connector, so an adaptor is required to connect <b>CFast</b> cards in place of standard SATA hard drives which use male connectors.|$|E
50|$|On 7 April 2014, Blackmagic Design {{announced}} the URSA cinema camera, which records to <b>CFast</b> media.|$|E
5000|$|Flash memory-based CompactFlash (CF) card (including <b>CFast</b> card) and XQD card (Note: {{some other}} types of CF and XQD card are not flash memory-based) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>CFast</b> 1.0/1.1 {{supports}} a higher maximum transfer rate than current CompactFlash cards, using SATA 2.0 (300 MByte/s) interface, while PATA {{is limited to}} 167 MByte/s using UDMA 7.|$|E
50|$|As of 2017, in {{the wider}} {{embedded}} electronics industry, transition from CF to <b>CFast</b> is still relatively slow, probably due to hardware cost considerations and some inertia (familiarity with CF) and because {{a significant part of}} the industry is satisfied with the lower performance provided by CF cards, thus having no reason to change. A strong incentive to change to <b>CFast</b> for embedded electronics companies using designs based on Intel PC architecture is the fact that Intel has removed native support for the (P)ATA interface a few design platforms ago and the older CPU/PCH generations now have end-of-life status.|$|E
50|$|On 24 February 2015 Arri {{announced}} the Alexa Mini. It {{has the same}} sensor as the other Alexa cameras. It features in-camera recording to <b>CFast</b> 2.0 cards, 200 FPS and 4K UHD in-camera upscaling.|$|E
50|$|The company's {{memory and}} storage {{products}} employ {{a variety of}} form factors and interfaces, including DIMM memory modules for DDR3L, MiniDIMM and ECC SoDIMM memory modules for DDR3L, and M.2, mSATA, <b>CFast,</b> Slim SATA, CompactFlash, PCI Express Mini Card, and eUSB SLC SSDs.|$|E
50|$|ApplianSys {{maintains}} its own hardened Linux operating {{system that has}} been developed {{from the ground up}} with appliance use in mind. All products make use of industrial grade <b>CFast</b> that in most cases stores both the OS and configuration files, minimising or removing reliance on non solid state storage for reasons of both performance and reliability.|$|E
50|$|The VCBT {{consists}} {{of a variety of}} simulation models that together emulate thecharacteristics and performance of a cybernetic building system.

50|$|SATA has {{replaced}} parallel ATA in consumer desktop and laptop computers; SATA's {{market share in}} the desktop PC market was 99% in 2008. PATA has mostly been replaced by SATA for any use; with PATA in declining use in industrial and embedded applications that use CompactFlash (CF) storage, which was designed around the legacy PATA standard. A 2008 standard, <b>CFast</b> to replace CompactFlash is based on SATA.|$|E
50|$|Seeking higher {{performance}} and still keeping a compact storage format, {{some of the}} earliest adaptors of <b>CFast</b> cards were in the gaming industry (used in slot machines), as a natural evolution from the by then well-established CF cards. Current gaming industry supporters of the format include both specialist gaming companies (e.g. Aristocrat Leisure) and OEMs such as Innocore (now part of Advantech Co., Ltd.).|$|E
50|$|Wintec Industries, {{founded in}} 1988, is {{headquartered}} in Newark, California. Wintec provides {{original equipment manufacturer}} (OEM), specialized services in product design, manufacturing, and supply chain services related to memory and storage components, featuring: flash modules (CF, SD, USB, <b>CFast,</b> embedded flash, SSD, etc.), DRAM modules (RDIMM, SODIMM, UDIMM, FBDIMM), wireless products, modem products (embedded and USB), and digital display products (ADD2 DVI, HDMI, and digital signage).|$|E
5000|$|The camera {{has several}} methods of recording, {{including}} SxS cards, <b>CFast</b> 2.0 cards and SXR Capture Drives at resolutions up to 2880 x 2160 pixels in either Rec. 709 or Log-C to ProRes or ARRIRAW codecs.

Additional recording devices for video include Atomos Ninja Star and Atomos Shogun Studio 4K.|$|E
50|$|In November 2010, SanDisk, Sony and Nikon {{presented}} a next generation card format to the CompactFlash Association. The new format {{has a similar}} form factor to CF/CFast but {{is based on the}} PCI Express interface instead of Parallel ATA or Serial ATA. With potential read and write speeds of 1 Gbit/s (125 MByte/s) and storage capabilities beyond 2 TiB, the new format is aimed at high-definition camcorders and high-resolution digital cameras, but the new cards are not backward compatible with either CompactFlash or <b>CFast.</b> The XQD card format was officially announced by the CompactFlash Association in December 2011.|$|E
50|$|Memory cards, {{with several}} implementations: CompactFlash vs. Memory Stick vs. MultiMediaCard (MMC) vs. Secure Digital card (SD) vs. SmartMedia vs. Miniature Card. The format war {{became even more}} {{confusing}} with introduction of xD-Picture Card, XQD card and <b>CFast</b> in the next decade. This ongoing contest {{is complicated by the}} existence of multiple variants of the various formats. Some of these, such as miniSD / microSD, are compatible with their parent formats, while later Memory Sticks break compatibility with the original format. After SD was introduced in 1999, it eventually won the war in the early 2000s decade when companies that had exclusively supported other formats in the past, such as Fujifilm, Olympus and Sony, began to use SD card in their products.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A two-zone model, <b>CFAST,</b> {{has been}} widely used in the fire re-search community. However, this study {{indicates}} that the <b>CFAST</b> model gener-ally overpredicts the upper layer temperatures in the burn room because the zonal assumption is likely to break down in the burn room. It {{was found that the}} room-averaged temperatures obtained from the <b>CFAST</b> model were in good agreement with the experimental results (one zone assumption in the burn room). The prediction of CO concentration is inconsistent. The <b>CFAST</b> model tends to overestimate CO concentration when the air-handling system is in op-eration, and to underestimate CO when the system is off. KEY WORDS: zone model, experiment...|$|E
40|$|Fire is a {{significant}} hazard in most facilities that handle radioactive materials. The severity of fire varies with room arrangement, combustible loading, ventilation and protective system response. The complexity of even simple situations can be unwieldy to solve by hand calculations. Thus, computer simulation of the fire severity has become an important tool in characterizing fire risk. The Savannah River Site (SRS), a Department of Energy facility, has been using the Consolidated Model of Fire Growth and Smoke Transport (<b>CFAST)</b> software to complete such deterministic evaluations to better characterize the nuclear facility fire severity. To fully utilize <b>CFAST</b> at SRS {{it is necessary to}} demonstrate that <b>CFAST</b> produces valid analytic solutions over its range of use. This report describes the primary verification exercise that is required to establish that <b>CFAST,</b> and its user interface program FAST, produce valid analytic solutions. This verification exercise may be used to check the fu nctionality of FAST and as a training tool to familiarize users with the software. In addition, the report consolidates the lessons learned by the SRS staff in using FAST and <b>CFAST</b> as fire modeling tools...|$|E
40|$|Over a 12 month period, a fire PRA was {{developed}} for a DOE facility using the NUREG/CR- 6850 EPRI/NRC fire PRA methodology. The fire PRA modeling included calculation of fire severity factors (SFs) and fire non-suppression probabilities (PNS) for each safe shutdown (SSD) component considered in the fire PRA model. The SFs were developed by performing detailed fire modeling {{through a combination of}} <b>CFAST</b> fire zone model calculations and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). Component damage times and automatic fire suppression system actuation times calculated in the <b>CFAST</b> LHS analyses were then input to a time-dependent model of fire non-suppression probability. The fire non-suppression probability model is based on the modeling approach outlined in NUREG/CR- 6850 and is supplemented with plant specific data. This paper presents the methodology used in the DOE facility fire PRA for modeling fire-induced SSD component failures and includes discussions of modeling techniques for: • Development of time-dependent fire heat release rate profiles (required as input to <b>CFAST),</b> • Calculation of fire severity factors based on <b>CFAST</b> detailed fire modeling, and • Calculation of fire non-suppression probabilities...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The zone model <b>CFAST</b> {{was used}} to make {{predictions}} of single room preflashover fire tests conducted in a steel enclosure. These results were then compared with previously published measurements obtained in fire tests. Tests included diesel pool fires, polyurethane slab fires, and wood crib fires. Half of these tests used natural ventilation (window, 1 / 4 door, and full door) while the remaining tests used forced ventilation (0. 25 m 3 /s, 0. 38 m 3 /s, and 0. 61 m 3 /s). With the exception of heat release rates, all <b>CFAST</b> inputs were selected without knowledge of the experimental results. Key variables compared include the upper layer temperature, the hot layer interface location, and ceiling temperatures. Overall, predictions made by <b>CFAST</b> were in good agreement with the data. There was a general tendency to over predict both the hot gas layer temperature and the boundary surface temperature which {{may be due to}} under prediction of boundary hea...|$|E

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the work performed by Numerical Applications, Inc. on LANL subcontract 3876 L 0013 - 9 Q. The primary objectives {{of this work}} were to generalize the fire compartment interface in the IBM PC version of FIRAC and to couple FIRAC with the <b>CFAST</b> computer code. The resulting FIRAC/CFAST computer code would combine the ventilation system and particulate transport modeling capabilities of FIRAC with the fire room modeling capabilities of <b>CFAST.</b> Additional project objectives included debugging FIRAC to correct errors that had been reported by the FIRAC-PC evaluators and evaluating requirements for modifying the FIRAC preprocessor and postprocessor {{to work with the}} combined code...|$|E
40|$|Data from a {{full-scale}} test of temperature and smoke spread, in a realistic multi-room setting, {{was used to}} verify simulations done in the computer programs <b>CFAST</b> and FDS. A closely corresponding HRR-curve {{was used in the}} programs. It was found that data from the top 0, 5 m of the full-scale test could be compared with reasonable accuracy to both simulation models. This would make simulations, used in fire investigation, more easily comparable to real life cases as the highest temperatures in each room could be compared to a probable fire cause. The simulations were found to provide satisfying results in <b>CFAST,</b> as an alternative to FDS. With <b>CFAST</b> it was also found that close to a fire, in a geometrically complicated room, a more detailed model would be better suited. Outside the initial room the critical factor would be {{to cut down on the}} sections to as few as possible. A sensitivity analysis was performed with both programs for the quality of the work, and as example for future usage. A cone calorimeter test was performed on the ceiling, due to uncertainties about its possible contribution to the total fire load. Differences and similarities between the simulations and the full-scale test, as well as critical factors for success are discussed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Prediction {{accuracy}} of zone models {{is attributed to}} the sophistication of the mathematical model, {{as well as the}} numerical methods applied in their implementation. Well-known zone models <b>CFAST</b> and OZone have gained world-wide acceptance among the fire engineering community in predicting enclosure fire dynamics. Despite these models serving similar purpose, the level of accuracy and applicability range are still a field of active research. This study compares an in-house developed zone model CFMFAN with <b>CFAST</b> and OZone in their modeling concepts, prediction capability, and accuracy. The sub-models for gas flow, heat transfer, and heat release rate are examined. Performance comparisons of these zone models with published experimental results for 20 single compartment fire tests are carried out in the blind mode. The test parameters used are the fire size (330 – 980 kW) and the fire location (center or side). For performance comparisons, the upper- and lower-layer temperatures, interface and neutral plane heights, pressure difference at the floor, wall temperatures, plume flow, and vent flow rates are compared. Upon comparison with compartment fire test results, the study shows that <b>CFAST</b> consistently overpredicts the upper-layer temperature whereas OZone and CFMFAN underpredict it for all fire sizes. All the models underpredict the lower-layer temperature. Explanations are given for the deviations of the three models from the test results and from one another.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the current capabilities of zone fire modeling. <b>CFAST</b> {{is used as}} the example, but as discussed at the end, the fundamental concepts are applicable {{to a wide range}} of models, available around the world. While there are aspects of the current model such as horizontal smoke movement that are features of <b>CFAST,</b> the basic conservation equations, methods of solution and difficulties are common to the whole spectrum of this class of building system models. Overview Analytical models for predicting fire behavior have been evolving since the 1960 's. Over the past decade, the completeness of the models has grown considerably. In the beginning, the focus of these efforts was to describe in mathematical language the various phenomena which were observed in fire growth and spread. These separate representations have typically described only a small part of a fire. When combined though, they can create a complex computational model intended to give an estimate of the expected course of a fire based upon given input parameters. These analytical models have progressed to the point of providing predictions of fire behavio...|$|E
