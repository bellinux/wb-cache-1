All of these crossings are done by bascule bridges and each bridge required height clearances at the approaches to and over the river. Further necessitating clearances were many existing railroad tracks that were along the river (as in the west bank of the south branch) or tracks that ended at the river (for example the tracks ending at Randolph Street). Thus along the river at points of many closely spaced crossings, a <b>clearance</b> <b>zone</b> was created.

Six (6) fungal isolates identified as Mucor racemosus Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Neurospora sitophilus, Penicillium oxalicum and Penicillium citrinum were isolated, while seven (7) different bacterial species isolated include Clostridium cellobioparum, Clostridium thermocellum, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumillus, Lactobacillus spp, Pseudomonas flavescens and Serratia spp. Generally, bacterial isolates were more in abundance than fungal species.

Hasanuzzaman et al.

Satpute et al. (2008) found emulsified hole in coated plates with crude oil after incubation for 7 â 10 Â days with Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas. In agreement with previous studies, this study found clearing zones formation after 7 Â day with different bacteria consortia. Wasta sample which have mixture of B. licheniformis, B. firmus and Bosea thioxidants showed the largest clearing zones diameter in heavy oil. Zones formed after incubation with free cells filtrate, suggest that these types of bacteria produce extracellular compounds that break oil and produce clearing zones. Chandran and Das (2010) concluded that culture supernatant of Trichosporon asahii (yeast) when inoculated with diesel oil, produced clear halo. Rodrigues et al. (2006) correlated higher surface activity of biosurfactant solution with larger diameter produced by Lactococcus lactis. Ting et al. (2009) reported that Pseudomonas lundensis produced clearing zones when incubated with oil by metabolizing long-chain-length of alkanes. Based on the result of this experiment and previous studies, the presence of clearing zones in oil plates is an evidence of oil biodegradation by the bacterial cells themselves and also by their extracellular metabolic-products.|$|R

Its composition is dependent on early stages of infancy and it is so abundant, that currently is being referred to as an organ. Prebiotics are fuel for microbial growth and are thought to facilitate the healthy balance of the microflora. In this study, MolkosanÂ®, an over-the-counter prebiotic has been tested on two bacteria commonly found in the human gastrointestinal tract: Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus plantarum. Standard microbiological techniques have been used along with Gram staining and antibiotic disks test. Selective media were chosen for growing of the combined colonies. The results show a significant influence of different MolkosanÂ® concentrations on growth of both bacteria, individually as well as combined with p< 0. 001. Opportunistically pathogenic E. coli numbers were notably decreased with the higher concentrations. The growth over time was affected by the concentration of the tested prebiotic as well with p< 0. 001 for both: E. coli and L. plantarum. In combined culture, the addition of large MolkosanÂ® concentrations was associated with a change in the ratio between the bacteria in favour of L. plantarum by 34 % between TSB control and 10 % prebiotic. The treatment influenced the antibiotic sensitivity of E. coli by increasing the <b>clearance</b> <b>zone</b> for Streptomycin, Tetracycline and Chloramphenicol (p< 0. 001) and decreasing L. plantarum <b>clearance</b> <b>zone</b> for Streptomycin and Tetracycline (p= 0. 028 and p= 0. 011 respectively).

40|$|Abstract Background Wound infections, due to biofilms, are a {{constant}} problem {{because of their}} recalcitrant nature towards antibiotics. Appropriate antibiotic selection {{for the treatment of}} these biofilm infections is important. The traditional in vitro disc diffusion method for antibiotic selection uses bacterial cultures grown on agar plates. However, the form of bacterial growth on agar is not representative of how bacteria grow in wounds and other tissue sites as here bacteria grow naturally in a biofilm. The aim of this research was to test a more appropriate method for testing antimicrobial efficacy on biofilms and compare with the standard methods used for antibiotic sensitivity testing. Methods Outer Membrane Protein analysis was performed on E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Acinetobacter juni when grown on Mueller Hinton agar ('quasi-biofilm state') and 30 % Poloxamer hydrogel ('true- biofilm state). Susceptibility to antibiotics on 28 clinical isolates was determined using the modified Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method, on agar and 30 % Poloxamer. Results Similar outer membrane proteins [OMPs] were identified in bacteria grown in a biofilm state and on a 30 % poloxamer hydrogel, which were very different to the OMPs identified in bacteria grown on Mueller-Hinton agar and broth. There was {{a significant difference between the}} means of the <b>clearance</b> <b>zones</b> around the antibiotic discs on standard agar and poloxamer gels [P 0. 05]. Conclusion The findings of this experiment suggest that poloxamer gel could be used as an appropriate medium on which to conduct biofilm antibiotic susceptibility tests as it enables bacteria to be grown in a state representative of the infected surface from which the culture was taken. </p...|$|R

After pilot scratch assays with 313 microorganisms, we isolated 113 bacteria and 8 filamentous fungi (in total 121 microorganisms) degrading PBSA, PBS, PCL or PLA on agar plates. In total 116 (95.87 %) microorganisms degraded PBSA emulsion, 73 (60.33 %) PBS, 102 (84.3 %) PCL and 56 (46.28 %) grew on PLA emulsion. In other studies (Penkhrue et al. 2015) there were isolated 26 (32.9 %) strains degrading PLA, 44 PBS (55.7 %) and 58 PCL (73.4 %) from soil samples collected in northern Thailand. Degradation of PBSA emulsion was not tested; in our study it reached the highest degree of biodegradation. Despite this fact, medium with PCL as a carbon source was degraded the easiest, while in contrast PLA was the hardest to degrade. In the case of PLA, the growth of microorganisms was evaluated without <b>zones</b> of <b>clearance.</b> Teeraphatpornchai et al. (2003) noted that PLA-degrading microorganisms always show biodegradable activity with other bioplastics, but most PBSA- or PBS-degrading microorganisms {{do not have the}} ability to degrade PLA. In that research, among 400 soil samples, only 4 strains showed clear zones with PLA emulsion, but only 1 strain (identified as Paenibacillus amylolyticus) was effectively degrading PBSA, PBS and PCL as well. Next, in the samples {{from the bottom of the}} Pacific Ocean 13 bacterial strain were identified, as Shewanella sp., Moritella sp., Psychrobacter sp. and Pseudomonas sp. (Sekiguchi et al. 2010). Interestingly, these bacteria showed clear zones only on PCL emulsion but not on other bioplastics such as PHB, PBS, PBSA or PLA. The lack of clear zones on PLA plates could be caused by too dry environmental conditions. It was shown that biodegradation of PLA occurs in a water environment or damp setting, which is difficult to replicate long-term in plate tests (Nowak and PajÄk 2010). Additionally, PLA is a type of polymer which needs more time to be degraded. It was noted, that in compost where the temperature was in the range 50 â 60 Â Â°C and with high humidity, degradation of PLA lasts 60 Â days. Among 5 PLA-degrading strains isolated from compost, after 25 Â days at 37 Â Â°C culture, the highest degradation (45.5 %) was shown by strain MS- 2 identified as Bacillus amyloliliquefaciens (Prema et al. 2013).
