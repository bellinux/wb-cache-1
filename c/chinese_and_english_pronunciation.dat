40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{factors that could}} affect inter-examiner reliability in the pronunciation assessment component of speaking tests. We hypothesized that the rating of pronunciation is susceptible to variation in assessment due {{to the amount of}} exposure examiners have to nonnative English accents. An inter-rater variability analysis was conducted on the <b>English</b> <b>pronunciation</b> ratings of three test candidate interlanguages: <b>Chinese,</b> Korean, <b>and</b> Indian <b>English.</b> <b>Pronunciation</b> was rated by 99 International English Language Testing System (IELTS) examiners across five geographically dispersed test centres. The examiners had either prolonged exposure, or no, or little exposure to the interlanguage of the candidates. A significant proportion of examiners rated pronunciation higher when they had prolonged exposure, and lower when they had no, or little, exposure to the candidates' interlanguage. The location of the test centre also had a significant effect on the pronunciation rating, independent of the familiarity variable, with a significant proportion of NNS raters scoring candidates from their home country higher than those who were not. It is recommended that interlanguage phonology familiarity should be considered in the design of speaking tests and rater training and that research is required into test centre bias and the phonological judgements and awareness of OPI raters. 19 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{factors that}} could affect inter-examiner {{reliability}} in the pronunciation assessment component of speaking tests. We hypothesise that the rating of pronunciation is susceptible to variation in assessment due to the type and amount of exposure examiners have to non-native English accents. In this study we conducted an inter-rater variability analysis on the <b>English</b> <b>pronunciation</b> ratings of three representative test candidate interlanguages: <b>Chinese,</b> Korean <b>and</b> Indian <b>English.</b> <b>Pronunciation</b> was rated by 99 examiners across five geographically dispersed test centres where examiners variously reported either prolonged exposure, or no prolonged exposure to the interlanguage of the candidates. The examiners rated the three speaking test candidates with a significant level of inter-rater variation. Pronunciation was rated significantly higher when the candidates interlanguage phonology was familiar and lower when it was unfamiliar. Moreover, a strong association between familiarity and the pronunciation rating was found. We attribute this to psycho-acoustic processes, namely, the perceptual magnet effect, and the resulting sociolinguistic phenomenon {{at the level of}} communicative interaction. This phenomenon we have termed interlanguage phonology accommodation. We found that interlanguage phonology accommodation is associated with inter-rater variation and should therefore be a major consideration in the design of speaking tests and rater training...|$|R
40|$|The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is {{the main}} English profi ciency test used by Australian {{universities}} to assess the suitability of international students to cope with study in Australia. The test is administered at many locations internationally, but {{it is assumed that}} the speaking component of the test is equivalent regardless of the test location <b>and</b> the <b>English</b> rater’s familiarity with the variety of English spoken by the candidate. This research challenged this assumption, by posing, for example, is Indian English speech rated the same in New Delhi, as it is in a test centre in Sydney (where Indian English is an unfamiliar variety) ? Would the candidate taking the test in New Delhi be advantaged because the speaking test examiners live amongst an Indian English speaking community? We hypothesized that the rating of pronunciation is susceptible to variation in assessment due to the amount of exposure examiners have to non-native English accents. An inter-rater variability analysis was conducted on the <b>English</b> <b>pronunciation</b> ratings of three test candidate interlanguages: <b>Chinese,</b> Korean, <b>and</b> Indian <b>English.</b> <b>Pronunciation</b> was rated by 99 IELTS examiners across fi ve geographically dispersed test centres. The examiners had either prolonged exposure, or no, or little exposure to the interlanguage of the candidates. A signifi cant proportion of examiners rated pronunciation higher when they had prolonged exposure, and lower when they had no, or little, exposure to the candidates’ interlanguage. The location of the test centre also had a signifi cant effect on the pronunciation rating, independent of the familiarity variable, with a signifi cant proportion of non-native speaker raters scoring candidates from their home country higher than those who were not. It was recommended that accent familiarity should be considered in the design of speaking tests and rater training and that further research is required into test centre and rater bias...|$|R

40|$|The present 9 -month {{longitudinal}} study investigated relations between Chinese native language phono-logical processing skills <b>and</b> early <b>Chinese</b> <b>and</b> <b>English</b> reading abilities among 227 kindergarteners in Hong Kong. Phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, and short-term verbal memory differed in their relations to concurrent <b>and</b> subsequent <b>Chinese</b> <b>and</b> <b>English</b> word recognition. The significant bidirectional relations between phonological awareness <b>and</b> <b>Chinese</b> reading ability remained even after {{accounting for the}} variance due to age, vocabulary, and visual skills performance. When all predictors were considered simultaneously, only phonological awareness remained {{a significant predictor of}} <b>Chinese</b> <b>and</b> <b>English</b> reading abilities both concurrently and longitudinally. The present study focused on two research questions related to early reading abilities among Hong Kong beginning readers.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{concentrated}} {{on the relationship between}} self-concept and language learning strategies. Participants of the study were 157 students from one University in Shandong, China. Quantitative data was collected through two questionnaires. The first one was the revised Chinese version of self-concept scale modified by Pan (2003) from Marsh’s (1992) SQDII. Another inventory based on Oxford’ classification system of learning strategies (SILL) was used to assess learner’s strategy use. By the reliability analysis, it was found that all these coefficients were significantly high, and the two questionnaires were reliable respectively. Based on the detailed analysis of data, some major findings through statistical analysis of SPSS 13. 0 were summarized as follows. First of all, the subjects’ English self-concept was medium, <b>and</b> the subjects’ <b>English</b> <b>pronunciation</b> self-concept was better than their general <b>English</b> self-concept <b>and</b> <b>English</b> speaking self-concept. Second, gender had no significant effects on the general <b>English</b> self-concept <b>and</b> <b>English</b> speaking self-concept. Finally, in terms of the relationship between <b>English</b> self-concept <b>and</b> language learning strategies, by Pearson correlation coefficients and multiple regressions, it was concluded that general English self-concept, <b>English</b> speaking self-concept <b>and</b> <b>English</b> <b>pronunciation</b> self-concept had the highest correlation level with the cognitive strategy, <b>and</b> <b>English</b> <b>pronunciation</b> self-concept had the weakest correlation level with the memory strategy and compensatory strategy. The findings of the study imply that there are some pedagogical implications for <b>English</b> learning <b>and</b> teaching. At the same time, teachers should attach importance to enhancing students’ English self-concept level in training their language learning strategies...|$|R
