50|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{discovered that}} the autopilot had been inadvertently switched from altitude hold to <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> (CWS) mode in pitch. In this mode, once the pilot releases pressure on the yoke (control column), the autopilot maintains the pitch attitude selected by the pilot until he moves the yoke again. Investigators believe the autopilot switched modes when the captain accidentally leaned against the yoke while turning {{to speak to the}} flight engineer, who was sitting behind and to the right of him. The slight forward pressure on the stick would have caused the aircraft to enter a slow descent, maintained by the CWS system.|$|E
50|$|A {{midway between}} fully {{automated}} flight and manual flying is <b>Control</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Steering</b> (CWS). Although {{going out of}} fashion in modern airliners as a stand-alone option, CWS is still a function on many aircraft today. Generally, an autopilot that is CWS equipped, has three positions being off, CWS and CMD. In CMD (Command) mode the autopilot has full control of the aircraft, and receives its input from either the heading /altitude setting, radio and navaids or the FMS (Flight Management System). In CWS mode, the pilot controls the autopilot through inputs on the yoke or the stick. These inputs are translated to a specific heading and attitude, which the autopilot will then hold until instructed to do otherwise. This provides stability in pitch and roll. Some aircraft employ a form of CWS even in manual mode, such as the MD-11 which uses a constant CWS in roll. In many ways, a modern Airbus fly-by-wire aircraft in Normal Law is always in CWS mode. The major difference is that in this system {{the limitations of the}} aircraft are guarded by the flight computer, and the pilot can not steer the aircraft past these limits.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study was}} conducted to evaluate the relative improvements in aircraft ride qualities that resulted from utilizing several control law configurations that were optimized for pilot handling qualities only. The airplane configuration used was an executive jet transport in the approach configuration. The control law configurations included the basic system, a rate feedback system, three command augmentation systems (rate command, attitude command, and rate command/attitude hold), and a <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> system. Both the longitudinal and lateral directional axes were evaluated. A representative example of each control law configuration was optimized for pilot handling qualities on a fixed base simulator. The root mean square airplane responses to turbulence were calculated, and predictions of ride quality ratings were computed by using three models available in the literature...|$|E
40|$|A revised {{treatment}} of nonrandom inputs was {{incorporated in the}} model. Response behavior was observed for two display configurations (a pictorial EADI presentation and a flight-director configuration requiring use of a panel-mounted airspeed indicator), two control configurations (attitude and velocity <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering),</b> and two shear environments, each of which contained a head-to-tail shear and a vertical component. In general, performance trends predicted by the model were confirmed experimentally. Experimental and analytical results both indicated superiority to the EADI display with respect to regulation of height and airspeed errors. Velocity steering allowed tighter regulation of height errors, but control parameters had little influence on airspeed regulation.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates how motorcycle dynamics may {{be improved}} by applying a steering system on the rear wheel. The study is carried out using a widely validated multi-body model of motorcycle and rider. Two types of rear steering systems are compared: a self-steering wheel coupled with a spring-damper assembly and a <b>controlled</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> whose <b>steering</b> angle is governed accordingly to a first-order relationship between front and rear steering angle. In general, any rear steering system transfers energy from weave mode to wobble mode. Thus, both solutions stabilise high-speed weave, but increase instability when braking.

The {{analysis of the data}} resulting from a factorial design of experiments reveals that the tracking task performance depends on the pilot and his experience at performing the task. Performance was not strongly affected by the type of control system used (velocity vector <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> versus 3 D automatic flight path guidance and control).

40|$|A {{simulator}} {{comparison of}} the velocity vector <b>control</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> (VCWS) system and a decoupled longitudinal control system is presented. The piloting task was to use the electronic attitude direction indicator (EADI) to capture and maintain a 3 degree glide slope {{in the presence of}} wind shear and to complete the landing using the perspective runway included on the EADI. The decoupled control system used constant prefilter and feedback gains to provide steady state decoupling of flight path angle, pitch angle, and forward velocity. The decoupled control system improved the pilots' ability to control airspeed and flight path angle during the final stages of an approach made in severe wind shear. The system also improved their ability to complete safe landings. The pilots preferred the decoupled control system in severe winds and, on a pilot rating scale, rated the approach and landing task with the decoupled control system as much as 3 to 4 increments better than use of the VCWS system...|$|E

40|$|Video footage depicts United Airlines Flight 175 (UA 175) {{impacting}} World Trade Center tower 2 (WTC 2) on September 11, 2001 in New York City via {{a trajectory}} comprised of two separate banked turns. The second turn was apparently {{not required to}} generate impact. The first turn, which maintains a constant angle of bank (AoB), is evident at 1. 2 miles before impact. [1] Although human control of UA 175 ’s observed maneuvers cannot be ruled out, the precise coordination of variables such as the selections of a correct bank angle and turn start time for the first turn apparently pose challenges to the unaided human control hypothesis. The observed turn stability favors the use of autopilot operation, either functioning in a conventional course control mode or in <b>Control</b> <b>Wheel</b> <b>Steering</b> (CWS) mode. The probability that either of these two control systems were used is discussed. Flight deck images of United and American airlines 757 s and 767 s suggest that such CWS functions may have been disabled circa 2001. Constant radius turns utilizing plotted waypoints during commercial aviation operations are routinely supported by augmented GPS navigation service and related commercial Flight Management Systems (FMS) available circa 2001. [2] As will be demonstrated, the implementation of UA 175 ’s observed 1. 2 mile constant radius arc, seconds earlier or later than observed, would apparently result in UA 175 missing WTC 2. Estimates of the likely effect of crosswinds on the approach to WTC 2 are also provided. It is noted that a projected impact via the first observed banked turn would have occurred under crosswind conditions capable of generating between 122 and 134 approximate total feet of lateral displacemen...|$|E

2500|$|For taxiing {{and during}} the {{beginning}} of the take-off, aircraft are steered by a combination of rudder input as well as turning the nosewheel or tailwheel. [...] At slow speeds the nosewheel or tailwheel has the most control authority, but as the speed increases the aerodynamic effects of the rudder increases, thereby making the rudder more and more important for yaw control. [...] In some aircraft (mainly small aircraft) both of these mechanisms are controlled by the rudder pedals so there is no difference to the pilot. [...] In other aircraft there is a special tiller <b>controlling</b> the <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> and the pedals control the rudder, and a limited amount of <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> (Usually 5 degrees of nosewheel steering). [...] For these aircraft the pilots stop using the tiller after lining up with the runway prior to take-off, and begin using it after landing before turning off the runway, to prevent over correcting with the sensitive tiller at high speeds. The pedals may also be used for small corrections while taxing in a straight line, or leading in or out of a turn, before applying the tiller, to keep the turn smooth.|$|R

40|$|The {{problems}} {{investigated in}} this study are (1) the design and analysis of strategies to <b>control</b> the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> on four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> automobiles; and (2) the estimation of lateral stability regions for a nonlinear 2 DOF vehicle;Rear Wheel Controllers are developed using linear optimal control theory under the assumption that all states are available, however, this assumption is rarely true. A methodology is then developed to use a minimum number of measurable states to obtain suboptimal rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> controllers which are less expensive and could be practically implemented. The methodology is based on achieving zero phase lag difference between yaw rate and lateral acceleration, and zero sideslip angle;It is shown analytically, using Routh Hurwith criteria, eigenvalue analysis and Lyapunov method, that at high speeds the suboptimal rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> controllers enhances the stability and improves the performance of four wheel fixed and free steering control vehicles. At low speeds, the effects of time lagged lateral tire force on front and four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles are studied and new stability conditions are derived;The influence of vehicle rolling motion is examined and a new rear wheel controller which includes roll parameters is developed. New steady-state handling conditions for the front and four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles are also derived;To further enhance vehicle design, the nonlinear numerical optimization method of sequential quadratic programming is used in conjunction with Routh Hurwitz criteria to determine the most restrictive stability conditions for front and four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> vehicles;Lyapunov second method, constrained optimization, and reverse trajectory methods are employed to estimate the lateral stability region, of a nonlinear two degree of freedom vehicle model, analytically and with minimal computation.
