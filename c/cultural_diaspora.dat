50|$|Though most {{geographic}} sources {{assign the}} area {{south of the}} Caucasus Mountain crest to Southwest or West Asia, no definition is entirely satisfactory, with it often becoming a matter of self-identification.

50|$|The release has {{historical}} significance for several reasons. Firstly, {{at the age}} of 73, Perry was suddenly finding new audiences for his music worldwide through the evolution of dub into dubstep. Secondly, its popularity was indicative of a <b>cultural</b> <b>diaspora</b> and evolution of a non-commercial subgenre of music developed in Jamaica largely by Perry into a movement that had rippled around the world through various music genres to later create a subgenre of electronic music called dubstep over 30 years later in the UK that reunited its offspring with their forefather and propelled them both to broader prominence that in the process crossed cultural, generational and racial boundaries.|$|E

The trio named themselves Treacherous Treis and showcased their work at the Museum of Art & Design, Singapore. After spending 9 years in Taiwan, he returned to Singapore and created a series of work named RECONSTITUTED PHILOSOPHIES. Loh began to paint contemporary still lifes of luncheon meat and syrup cans, using the common everyday objects to express his <b>cultural</b> <b>diaspora.</b> This collection of works, which included an installation titled [...] "Cherry Poke", exhibited at his second show at the Esplanade in 2011. In the same year, some of those works were selected by the Andy Warhol foundation to be showcased in Andy Warhol's exhibition, 15 Minutes Eternal, at ArtScience Museum Marina Bay Sands.

5000|$|Her {{sculptures and}} {{installations}} explore themes of African <b>cultural</b> <b>diaspora</b> and spirituality. Saar's multiethnic upbringing, multiracial identity and her studies of Latin American, Caribbean and African art and religion have informed her work. Saar’s fascination with vernacular folk art {{and ability to}} build an oasis of beauty from cast-off objects are evident in her sculptures and paintings. Her highly personal, often life-sized sculptures are marked by their emotional candor, and by contrasting materials and messages that imbue her work {{with a high degree}} of cultural subtext. Her sculptures are powerful representations of issues relating to gender and race as well as heritage and history through her personal experience as well as cultural and artistic influences. Saar's work [...] "Hi, Yella" [...] was included in the 1993 Whitney Biennial, a benchmark in American exhibitions for it's critical tone and content. In a review of the Biennial, New York Times art critic Roberta Smith said that Saar's work was among the [...] "few instances where the political and visual join forces with real effectiveness." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Benedict Anderson, “nationality” {{was formed}} from the {{accumulation}} of cultural artifacts that were able to be transplanted to an array of environments and societies and merge {{with a wide variety}} of political and ideological frameworks. This imagined nationality as Benedict calls it, is a constantly shifting and dynamic entity. “It is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow members, yet in the mind of each lives the image of their communion.” (Anderson, 6). Celtic identity is one such imagined community. The diaspora of Celts from other areas of the world to America is representative of the imagined community. [...] The <b>cultural</b> <b>diaspora</b> from the United Kingdom, specifically Scotland, Ireland and England, landed primarily in the Appalachian region of the United States. Thousands of immigrants sailed and maintained and improved on agricultural pursuits to better improve their lives. The British brought with them cultural elements such as music, dress, and ideology. Among these Brits were those defined as Celts, or people who resided in or spoke the languages of Ireland, Wales, Scotland, or Brittany. The Celtic identity is complex: A large portion of this Celticness rested on musical practices, both spoken word and instrumental, that constructs the distinct identity. Layered regional and national identities were assembled over time in the Celtic-speaking world, centered on practices of both modern and historic Celtic instruments.|$|E

Jha also states that, [...] "stereotypical portrayals of the <b>cultural</b> <b>diaspora</b> are fortunately rare in this piece of contemporary art which has plenty of heart, a heart that never overflows in an embarrassing torrent of emotions." [...] Devansh Patel, film critic for London's Hounslow Chronicle, gave New York five out of five stars stating that it is, [...] "the most thought provoking movie Yash Raj Films has ever come up with." [...] Nikhat Kazmi of the Times of India gave it {{four out of five}} stars, describing New York as, [...] "an extremely taut and highly emotive piece of political drama ... topical, meaningful, and entertaining, all at the same time." [...] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave it four out of five stars arguing that New York is [...] "one of the finest films produced by this premier production house, Yash Raj ... the screenplay is its biggest star, without a doubt. Given the fact that New York isn't one of those routine masala fares, Kabir has injected songs only when required. Cinematography is striking." [...] Joginder Tuteja of the Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) calls the film [...] "a must watch" [...] and gave it four out of four stars. He states: [...] "When a hardcore commercial flick gets a standing ovation and a huge round of applause {{at the end of the}} show, you know that there is something definitely right that the director has done. In this regard, Kabir Khan can take a bow because he has done exceedingly well in making a film that is not frivolous, has a message and still carries enough commercial ingredients to reach out to masses as well as classes." [...] Mayank Shekhar of the Hindustan Times argues that comparing New York [...] "to Mark Pellington’s Arlington Road would be grossly unfair. If anything, this is a much better movie than that 1999, part-spooky conspiracy theory. The central theme itself is closer to Shoaib Mansoor’s Khuda Kay Liye (2007), and you can sense how the superior execution here makes all the filmmaking difference." [...] Additionally, Shekhar describes New York in NDTV as, [...] "an A-list film that gets a straight A." [...] Sandhya Iyer of the Sakaal Times gave the film three and a half out of four stars arguing that [...] "New York manages to be gripping, thanks to an excellent screenplay. Most importantly, the story has the right mix of realism and drama - one that Kabir Khan unfolds with quiet confidence."

40|$|The {{strategy}} of foreignising translation is effective for curtailing interference or manipulation {{so as to}} allow the target reader to experience the original text somewhat “directly” in its “authentic” form. However, foreignisation is not unconditionally workable, given {{the constraints of the}} target language with its linguistic and cultural norms and conventions, which are directly related to the general acceptability of translations. For an eventual resolution of the age-old impasse of foreignisation versus domestication, I propose to introduce the concept of <b>cultural</b> <b>diaspora,</b> and suggest an alternative perception of translation activity, with a proper consideration of the historical and social circumstances of reception regarding translation and foreign otherness. <b>Cultural</b> <b>diaspora</b> in respect to translation means rethinking cultural identity and moving towards a diasporic register as a remedy for insufficient connections between the source and target texts by strategically relocating the cultural home of the target reader into a “third space”, which is supposed to be culturally neutral and thus provides a site for cultural hybridisation so as to avoid reducing the richness and complexity of the original in the created replica that represents not merely salient foreign features but also most of the essential qualities of the source text. Meanwhile, an otherwise utterly alien experience can be avoided, since the target reader will not be forced to abandon their homeland so as to avoid being estranged from their cultural tradition...|$|E
40|$|Work by Filipino {{scholars}} {{reveals the}} <b>cultural</b> <b>diaspora</b> of the Filipinos: that Filipinos behave like foreigners {{in their own}} land. But to date, relatively {{little is known about}} the cause of or the solution to this <b>cultural</b> <b>diaspora.</b> A case in point is the Cebuano area, occupying the middle section of the Philippines and a portion of the bottom area, called Mindanao. Toward this end, the writer attempts to trace the roots and to look for a remedy of the cultural alienation the Cebuanos feel by telescoping the role translation played in this region during the years foreigners occupied it. To shed light on this problem we use the semiotic approach with its focus on icons, indices and symbols. We have found out that through translation – the rewriting of foreign texts into Cebuano – the natives easily succumbed to the lure of foreign tongues, of alien cultures. In due time, the Cebuanos became strangers in their own region. Despite this grievous cultural problem separating the Cebuanos from themselves, over time, by reversing the process of enculturation, their racial identity and cultural traditions may be able to define them. This reversal can be done by the translation, this time, of their own literary texts into English, a language known to nearly all of them. Key terms: browns (Filipinos), whites (Spaniards, Americans), yellows (Japanese), icon (pictorial representation), index (clue or symptom), symbol (text or words which are based on cultural conventions) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{study how}} the city system is {{affected}} by the possibility for the members of the same <b>cultural</b> <b>diaspora</b> to interact across different cities. In so doing, we propose a simple two- city model with two mobile cultural groups. A localized esternality fosters the productivity of individuals when groups interact in a city. At the same time, such interaction dilutes cultural identities and reduces the consumption of culture-specific goods and services. We show that the two groups segregate in di¤erent cities when diaspora members find it hard to communicate at distance whereas they integrate in multicultural cities when communication is easy. The model generates situations in which segregation is an equilibrium but is Pareto dominated by integration. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{identity}} issues of South-Asians in the Diaspora. It engages the theoretical and methodological debates concerning processes {{of culture and}} identity in the contemporary context of globalization and transnationalism. It analyses the works of South-Asian Diaspora writers tracing out the dynamics of power towards critical alternatives that recognise and value similarities and accommodation of groups and individuals. The themes taken up by these South-Asian Diaspora writers relate to the issues of racism, the experience of displacement, the process of transculturation, the tensions between individuals and so forth. Their writing, in its accounts of immigrant experience and otherness reflects the ambivalences and complexities inherent in the conceptions of the race, class, ethnicity and identity. The present paper taps this journey from ideological construct to identity formation in South-Asian Diaspora Studies. The paper makes an attempt to evolve the essence of <b>cultural</b> <b>Diaspora...</b>|$|E
40|$|This work {{is part of}} ‘Fragile Littoral: Europa’, {{an ongoing}} series {{conceived}} as an essay on fragile states attempting to ‘view’ Europe from its liminal boundaries - from the placelessness between coastal edge and actual ocean constituting a ‘beyond’ that remains proximal. Heavily influenced by Bourke’s research in Japan, particularly in its adoption of an aesthetics of impermanence, its thematic ‘roots’ are in the earlier ‘Spa’ series (1992 - 2000), ‘Dark Bride’ (1998), ‘Dogde’ (2001) and ‘Bird Flying Empty Sky’ (2002). ‘Diaspora: after Caspar David Friedrich’ responds to the term ‘diaspora’ {{as it relates to}} a European context. Imagery alludes, in part, to Friedrich’s ‘Woman at a Window’ and makes oblique reference to manifestations of <b>cultural</b> <b>diaspora</b> and individual yearning. It continues Bourke’s ongoing preoccupation with fragility and appearance/disappearance, and the ‘slippage’ between lyrical sensuality and disturbance.
