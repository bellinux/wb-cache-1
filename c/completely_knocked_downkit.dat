40|$|Loss-of-function {{mutations}} cause many mendelian diseases. Here we {{aimed to}} create a catalog of autosomal genes that are <b>completely</b> <b>knocked</b> out in humans by rare loss-of-function mutations. We sequenced the whole genomes of 2, 636 Icelanders and imputed the sequence variants identified in this set into 101, 584 additional chip-genotyped and phased Icelanders. We found a total of 6, 795 autosomal loss-of-function SNPs and indels in 4, 924 genes. Of the genotyped Icelanders, 7. 7 % are homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for loss-of-function mutations with a minor allele frequency (MAF) below 2 % in 1, 171 genes (complete knockouts). Genes that are highly expressed in the brain are less often <b>completely</b> <b>knocked</b> out than other genes. Homozygous loss-of-function offspring of two heterozygous parents occurred less frequently than expected (deficit of 136 per 10, 000 transmissions for variants with MAF < 2 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 10 - 261) ...|$|R
