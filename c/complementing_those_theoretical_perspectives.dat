50|$|Unlike some {{theories}} that {{are rooted in}} other <b>theoretical</b> <b>perspectives</b> from various fields of study, SIP was conceptualized, in part, by addressing the shortcomings of other {{theories that}} addressed communication mediums. These theories are termed cues filtered-out theories. Cues filtered-out theories refer to theories that address the lack of nonverbal cues as being detrimental to online relationship development. Walther's research critiqued past methodological and conceptual problems with theoretical thinking. He subsequently worked toward establishing an interpersonal communication theory that more accurately reflected the intersection among communication, online environments, the self and relationships. Two of <b>those</b> <b>theoretical</b> <b>perspective</b> that influenced Walther's theory are social presence theory and media richness theory. Walther believes that both SPS and MRT suffer from a limited understanding of relational life online. He argues that if interactants communicate enough times and with sufficient breadth and depth, nonverbal communication does not remain paramount in relationship development.|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of event}} {{structure}} on retrospective duration judgments Although {{the ubiquity of}} time estimation behavior often goes unnoticed, it nonetheless mediates {{a wide variety of}} cognitive experience. In some cases, time judgments may be involved in extrapolation tasks, as, for example, in passing or braking for another car, or in temporal-order tasks, as in reproducing the sequence of a given event. Similarly, people are also routinely required to make relative duration judgments, temporal discriminations, and timed motor responses. Of particular interest here is still another situation—one requiring an estimation from memory of an event’s actual duration. For example, after attending a lecture, movie, or concert, or after driving to a particular destination, one will often have some sense of the event’s total duration. The questions explored in the present research concern, first, the set of factors that determine the accuracy of such judgments, and second, the types of processing mechanisms that may be responsible for these effects. Both relate to more general issues within the time estimation literature and to <b>those</b> <b>theoretical</b> <b>perspectives</b> guiding this research. The Study of Remembered Duration Empirical investigations of temporal judgments have relied {{on a wide variety of}} tasks and measurement techniques whose applications have been extensively de...|$|R

40|$|Japan {{has been}} {{regarded}} by all mainstream International Relations theories as a status quo power intent on pursuing an immobilist international strategy toward China characterized by hedging {{rather than any}} move to active balancing. This paper challenges these assumptions and asks whether Japan will, or indeed already is, moving toward active balancing. The paper does so by reinterpreting the very assumptions of <b>those</b> <b>theoretical</b> <b>perspectives</b> that predict only hedging and by drawing on fresh empirical evidence. It argues that the conditions that are thought to encourage hedging behavior—the predictability of other states’ intentions, the malleability of intentions through engagement, domestic preferences that obviate balancing, and a favorable offense-defense balance—are now deteriorating {{in the case of}} Japan’s strategy toward China. Japanese policy-makers over the last decade have experienced an accelerated decline in their confidence to read China’s intentions and to mold these, to the point that China is now regarded as an increasingly malign actor. Japan’s own domestic regime change, paralleling that of China, has released Revisionist forces that favor the cessation of the “underbalancing” of China. Very significantly, Japanese policy-makers’ faith is eroding in the ability to maintain defensive superiority over China, either through its own internal capabilities or the U. S. -Japan alliance. The consequence is that the evidence is now mounting of Japan shifting toward active “soft” and incipient “hard” balancing of China through a policy of the active “encirclement” of China diplomatically, the build-up of Japanese national military capabilities aimed to counter China’s access denial and power projection, and the strengthening of the U. S. -Japan alliance. This shift has become particularly evident following the 2010 trawler incident and the return to power of Prime Minister Abe Shinzō in 2012. The consequences of Japan’s shifting strategy are yet as not entirely clear. Japan may be moving toward a form of “Resentful Realism” that does not add to a new equilibrium to regional security but is actually more destabilizing and poses risk for China and the U. S., especially as Japan’s own security intentions become more opaque. In turn, these conclusions invite a reconsideration of the comfortable theoretical consensus on Japan as an eternal status quo power, and encourage Constructivism, Neoliberalism, but especially Neorealism, to be bolder in their assertions about the probability and degree of radicalism in Japan’s security trajectory...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} what kind of idea a group of students in third grade, who attends a school in the Stockholm area, have on group work in school and how they think it affects their learning. The study is based on two questions: What opinion do the students have about group work? What opinion do the students have about how group work affects their learning? The method I have used to retrieve information has been to interview six different students, where the interviews were both individually and in groups. I started by interviewing students individually and then had a group interview. The idea with the group interview was to end it all with a brief discussion about the thoughts that came up during the individual interviews. I chose a selection of six students, four girls and two boys which they all were at the age of 9 and go to the same school. The socio-cultural and structural <b>perspectives,</b> is <b>those</b> <b>theoretical</b> <b>perspectives</b> that my study is based on. I will describe how student’s group work can be linked to theories of Jean Piaget and Lev Vygotsky. Piaget's theory focuses on the student's development as the primary constructive, while Vygotsky presents student’s development and socio-cultural. From these two perspectives, I will highlight how students get affected by each other in the context of group work. The core concept in my study is based on cooperative learning, which is a new approach to group work. I will also define other concepts such as group and group work. The results of this study show that students connect group work to collaborative situations both in and outside of school. The learning was connected to both the formal and informal learning in groups. According to the students the concept of teamwork is to work together, and many times the students connected the teamwork with collaborative situations outside of school rather than in school. Students see group work as both an obstacle and an opportunity for learning. Five of the six students were united on the fact that group work in schools do not work because they rarely collaborate. Based on the results of the interviews the students connected "good cooperation" with "learning", and it mostly focused on the informal learning that occurred outside of school. While the concept of "group work in school" was connected to something more complicated. This study shows how student learning is affected by group work in and outside of school...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{differences}} in adaptation to the environment of service, mixed, and manufacturing companies. Adaptations are contingent {{on the characteristics of}} the environment and technology. By them, companies try to manage environmental uncertainties. The latter are subjectively perceived amplifications of small scale multi-level, lagged, nested, and nonlinear changes. Companies intend to manage perceived environmental uncertainties. They facilitate adaptations that either reduce environmental uncertainties or make an efficient reaction to unexpected external developments possible. First type of adaptations is explained by resource dependence theory transaction-cost economics: the second one is explained by contingency theory. Strategic choice theory incorporates both types of adaptations. On the grounds of <b>those</b> four <b>theoretical</b> <b>perspectives,</b> we constructed a research model of organizational adaptations to environmental change. The focus is on exploration of differences in adaptations among service, mixed, and manufacturing companies. Organizational adaptations are studied from internal as well as external perspective. Research is based on a survey conducted on the sample of 236 medium and large companies in the period 2000 – 2005 in Slovenia. Findings confirmed that companies with different technology adapt differently. Mixed companies adapt mainly through external relationships, manufacturing companies adapt mainly internally, while service companies use both types of adaptations in congruent proportions. Adaptations of mixed companies are best explained by resource dependence theory, adaptations of manufacturing companies by environmental contingency theory, and adaptations of service companies are best explained by strategic choice theory...|$|R
40|$|National minorities, {{who claim}} {{autonomy}} and self-government rights, {{have always been}} a controversial problem in the fields of international law, political theory and nationalism. Multiculturalism and egalitarianism are two approaches that have long been discussed in all of these fields and implemented in various contexts. The success of policies that seem to be associated with these two approaches, however, has varied from one case to another. This study asks if failures of these approaches {{have anything to do with}} the contexts in which they take place. If so, what is the context in which these approaches prove to be futile? Theorists themselves explain aspects of an ideal context under which their theories can become fruitful. These ideal contexts and circumstances are, however, unrealistic; and their assumptions about the nature of social relationships do not always correspond with the reality. This study aims to find a more reliable criterion to assess the applicability of multiculturalism and egalitarianism. The thesis explains the relationship between national minorities and the state through a phenomenological paradigm. In this paradigm national minorities, the thesis argues, vary according to the state nationalisms they have experienced in the past. The thesis analyses the relational nature of minority and state nationalisms from this inter-subjective perspective. Within this framework, this study posits the hypothesis that multiculturalism and egalitarianism cannot produce viable solutions to the problems of national minorities who were persistently exposed to the policies of forced assimilation and civic state nationalism. The study reveals that a certain strand of multiculturalism that is ethnocentric cannot come to terms with such national minorities under the integrationist civic state nationalism because, from an inter-subjective perspective, the boundaries between the majority and the minority communities in this context are more fluid and diverse than they would otherwise have been. In such cases, resorting to ethno-centric multiculturalism and promoting the ‘authentic’ ethnic identities hampers the very diversity it seeks to promote. The thesis suggests that differenceblind egalitarianism is equally problematic in such cases because it cannot come to terms with the systematic injustice and the concomitant conflict that the policies of forced assimilation have created. As such its implementation weakens the very equality it seeks to promote. In order to explore and test this hypothesis, the dissertation makes use of a single in-depth case study of Turkey. In the period of candidacy for accession to the EU, Turkey is currently experimenting with ethnocentric multiculturalism to accommodate its Kurdish population more equitably. In Turkey, however, neither the contemporary discourse of ethno-centric multiculturalism nor the historical implementation of difference-blind egalitarianism seems to be a viable option from a liberal perspective. Observing the reasons for this failure enables the reader to develop a new insight to identify the cases where <b>those</b> <b>theoretical</b> <b>perspectives</b> could be more successful. Mindful of the fact that generalizing from a single case study is difficult, the case of Turkey will also be situated within a study of comparative cases to test the consistency of the hypothesis in this dissertation...|$|R

40|$|Aim The aim of {{the study}} was to explore the <b>theoretical</b> <b>perspectives</b> in use by {{approved}} clinical nursing supervisors in Sweden. Background For the time being, we know little of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>perspectives</b> in use on a daily basis by the clinical nursing supervisors in Sweden. Methods A questionnaire (n= 49) and follow-up telephone interviews (n= 14) were used. Data analysis was made by descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis. Results The result from the questionnaire showed that the supervisors often used and combined different <b>theoretical</b> <b>perspectives</b> with origins in nursing, education and psychology. Surprisingly, one-fourth of the respondents did not state any nursing <b>theoretical</b> <b>perspective</b> in use during clinical nursing supervision. The result from the interviews revealed that the theory of Katie Eriksson (1987) was the most commonly used nursing perspective. Conclusion As the overall aim for clinical nursing supervision is to improve nursing for the patient/family, the supervisor’s competence in nursing is essential. Given this fact, and that only three-quarters of the approved clinical nursing supervisors stated a use of <b>theoretical</b> nursing <b>perspective</b> when supervising, there is obviously a need for further investigations in this area. In addition, there is also a need for approved Swedish clinical nursing supervisors, to further become aware of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>perspective</b> in use that supports their clinical nursing supervision. Clinical nursing supervision is a multifaceted activity that needs to be supported by different nursing <b>theoretical</b> <b>perspectives</b> including physical, emotional, intellectual, spiritual as well as socio-cultural aspects...|$|R
