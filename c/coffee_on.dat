5|$|After WrestleMania, Massaro {{continued}} as a valet for WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick. In storyline, on the April 13 episode of SmackDown!, Massaro {{was attacked by}} Jillian Hall. In reality, Massaro had loosened a screw in her ankle, which had been inserted the previous year after she legitimately fractured her tibia and fibula while in a battle royal. Massaro returned on the June 1, 2007 episode of SmackDown!, helping McCool defeat Hall after she distracted her. This return was short lived when on the June 8 edition of SmackDown!, Massaro was suspended indefinitely after accidentally spilling Mr. McMahon's <b>coffee</b> <b>on</b> him. In reality, Massaro was taking time off to participate on the show Survivor.|$|E
5|$|On September22, much {{of eastern}} Cuba was placed under storm alert by President Fidel Castro. Authorities worked quickly to clean storm drains, trim trees, and move {{residents}} to safety, including 30,000 {{children in the}} mountains who were picking <b>coffee.</b> <b>On</b> September23, authorities in Cuba evacuated 200,000 residents from coastal areas as Georges neared landfall. The Cuban Red Cross reported that nearly 500,000 people were evacuated, of which 200,000 were placed in shelters. Later reports stated that about 711,000 people were evacuated from dangerous areas. Flights {{in and out of}} the county were cancelled and schools were closed due to the storm. In addition to the evacuation of residents, more than 90,000 head of cattle were relocated to higher ground.|$|E
5|$|At the hospital, Natasha blames Andrew for the crash. She learns Ed has a {{fractured}} collarbone and sits with {{him until he}} wakes up. When he does, Natasha kisses him. They begin dating, but Natasha worries {{that they do not}} have much in common. Natasha helps organise a ball for the university and takes an immediate dislike to Ed's vintage suit. She spills <b>coffee</b> <b>on</b> it and then lends Ed a nicer one that she found. Ed realises what she has done and they fight. After apologising to each other, Natasha decides to break up with Ed, as they are too different. When Natasha finds Andrew having a fit in Charlie's, she learns that he has epilepsy. She agrees to keep it a secret. After he collapses, Natasha encourages Andrew to go to the hospital for tests. Before he can leave, he suffers a fit in front of Paul. Andrew initially blames Natasha for causing the fit when Paul takes Charlie's away from him. She then helps him to convince Paul to change his mind. Natasha and Andrew begin dating again in secret. They later decide to tell everyone and Summer reveals that she already knew and does not mind. Natasha later finds an old email from Andrew proclaiming his love for Summer and she begins to worry about her relationship with him. However, Andrew reassures her that he loves her and their relationship is different this time around. Natasha asks Andrew to take a month of celibacy, but they end up breaking it early.

5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{learns that}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{will be taking}} {{a leave of absence}} to go on jury duty for the Scranton Strangler trial, leading the {{corporate}} office to send Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) to cover for him. Michael forces Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to plan a second, classier Christmas party on the day Holly returns to Scranton. Michael welcomes Holly back, but becomes upset when she tells him that she and A.J. (Rob Huebel) are still in a relationship. Holly then tells the women of the office that she's giving A.J. an ultimatum: either propose to her by year's end or their relationship is over. Michael lies to Holly and tells her that he's seeing a woman named Tara from New York, and Holly shows curiosity, but Michael interprets this as potential jealousy. When Michael gets further upset over hearing about Holly's relationship with A.J., he takes her toy Woody from Toy Story—a present from A.J.—throws it in the trash, and pours his <b>coffee</b> <b>on</b> it. When Holly demands to know who did it, Michael comes forward and admits that he still has feelings for her and is hurt that, while they had to break up due to their long distance, she is nevertheless able to make such an arrangement work with A.J. This, in turn, makes her feel bad for Michael. A.J. arrives in Scranton to surprise Holly and Michael welcomes him politely. After cleaning Holly's Woody, he leaves the office and Pam follows him out, where he breaks down. In order to lift his spirits, Pam tells him about Holly's ultimatum, suggesting their relationship is not going to last very long. He returns to the party where he overhears Holly and A.J. talking about Woody, with Holly fabricating a story to cover for Michael's actions.|$|E

25|$|The {{impact of}} <b>coffee</b> <b>on</b> the Brazilian economy was much {{stronger}} than that of sugar and gold. When the coffee surge began, Brazil was already free from the limitations of colonialism. Moreover, the substitution of slave labor for wage labor after 1870 (slavery was abolished in 1888) meant an increase in efficiency {{and the formation of}} a domestic market for wage goods. Finally, the greater complexity of coffee production and trade established important sectorial linkages within the Brazilian economy.|$|E

25|$|Having {{seemingly}} {{recovered from}} his illness, Cook met with Palmer for <b>coffee</b> <b>on</b> 17 November, and soon found himself sick once again. At this point Palmer assumed responsibility for Cook; Cook's solicitor, Jeremiah Smith, sent {{over a bowl}} of soup, which Palmer had in his possession before he sent it {{to the kitchen to}} be reheated. Chambermaid Elizabeth Mills took two spoonfuls of the soup and subsequently fell ill; Cook was given the rest of the soup, and his vomiting became worse than ever.|$|E
25|$|Will {{arrived at}} Kingston on 7 March, with 405 slaves on board. Crow had six crew members die and four desert.

25|$|Some coffee states, like Costa Rica and Colombia, {{passed laws}} like the Homestead Act of 1862. They favored smallholders, held elections, {{maintained}} small militaries, and fought fewer wars. Smallholder arrangements prompted widespread government investment in education. Other states like El Salvador and Guatemala produced <b>coffee</b> <b>on</b> plantations, where individuals were more disenfranchised. Whether a state became a smallholder or plantation state depended not on factor endowments but on norms established under colonialism—namely, legal statues determining access to land, {{the background of}} the governing elites, and the degree of permitted political competition. Nugent and Robinson thereby conclude that factor endowments alone do not determine economic or political institutions.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{fell into}} disrepair {{throughout most of}} the 20th century, eventually losing its massive cornice to a fire in 1913. The building was first surveyed in June 1969 and included on the Municipal Art Commission List of Historic Buildings, at which time it was nominated for inclusion on the National Register. It was finally listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 12, 1974. It also became a Seattle City Landmark in 1978. The upper floors stayed vacant until the 1990s, sustaining much weather damage in the meantime and later being destroyed by fire. Most of the building was rebuilt behind the main facade in 1997-8 and now houses condominiums with a Starbucks <b>Coffee</b> <b>on</b> the first level.|$|E
25|$|On February 27, 1992, Stella Liebeck, a 79-year-old {{woman from}} Albuquerque, New Mexico, ordered a 49-cent {{cup of coffee}} from the drive-through window of a local McDonald's {{restaurant}} located at 5001 Gibson Boulevard Southeast. Liebeck was in the passenger's seat of a 1989 Ford Probe which did not have cup holders. Her grandson parked the car so that Liebeck could add cream and sugar to her coffee. Liebeck placed the coffee cup between her knees and pulled {{the far side of}} the lid toward her to remove it. In the process, she spilled the entire cup of <b>coffee</b> <b>on</b> her lap. Liebeck was wearing cotton sweatpants; they absorbed the coffee and held it against her skin, scalding her thighs, buttocks, and groin.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{problems}} are {{also associated with}} storm water management, with large amounts of sediment being deposited <b>on</b> <b>Coffee</b> Creak, <b>on</b> {{the western side of}} the Conservation Area. This deposition damages native vegetation and habitat. These impacts also mean that there are indirect considerations involving development upstream of the Conservation Area. For example, development upstream and adjacent to <b>Coffee</b> Creek, <b>on</b> the Conservation Area's western side, could detrimentally effect the Conservation Area and its associated reserves. Local water courses are particularly sensitive to pollution and sedimentation.|$|R
