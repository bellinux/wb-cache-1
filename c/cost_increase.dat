The construction cost, originally estimated to be £16 million, had doubled to £32 million by the time construction was completed. Merseytravel rejected criticism of the delays and <b>cost</b> <b>increase,</b> stating that it had been caused by factors beyond its control, such as the collapse of Railtrack, increasing steel costs and poor weather causing flooding at the construction site.|$|E

The move led to reported customer backlash, cancellations, lower than projected subscriber growth, and a decline in stock price. In response, Netflix admitted to poor public relations decisions in announcing the change but kept its policy in place.|$|E

25|$|The House Appropriations Committee’s Defense panel {{drafted a}} bill for the 2008 Defense Budget which zeroed out funding for ARH-70 production, citing Bell's {{inability}} to enter production, but continued funding for research and development. However, government officials began working on export policy to allow international sales of the ARH-70. Including the U.S. Army's expected total of 512 helicopters, orders were anticipated to total over 1,000. The Army filed a Nunn-McCurdy cost and schedule breach on 9 July 2008, when new cost estimates showed a 40% <b>cost</b> <b>increase</b> above initial estimates.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the war in 1945 {{the line}} was in need of a major overhaul, in {{particular}} the overhead wires. Lack of materials and money caused the extraordinary maintenance to take four years. Limitations of freight were imposed in 1946, and were terminated the following year. At the same time, the Kolsås Line services were internally numbered 14, but it was first many years later that the number appeared on the destination signs and schedules. A former barracks was moved to Avløs in 1948, where it was used as office space. The line had unchanged fares from 1939 to 1951, when the prices hiked 27percent. However, this was not sufficient to cover the 170percent <b>cost</b> <b>increase</b> in the same period.|$|E
25|$|Congress {{appropriated}} a {{total of}} $20.5 million in fiscal 1968, 1969, and 1970 to complete work on the substructure. The first contract for construction of the three-story substructure was awarded in November 1967. By October 1969, construction of the substructure was under way. By June 1970, however, the cost for the FBI building had ballooned to $102.5 million. GSA officials blamed inflation for the <b>cost</b> <b>increase.</b> At the same time, GSA said that the contract for construction of the third story of the substructure was due to be awarded in March 1971. That contract went to Blake Construction. Construction of the eight-story Pennsylvania Avenue building, 11-story E Street building, and wings was estimated in June 1970 to begin in late 1973 or early 1974.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of LHC was approved in 1995 {{with a budget}} of SFr 2.6bn, with another SFr 210M towards the experiments. However, cost overruns, estimated in a major review in 2001 at around SFr 480M for the accelerator, and SFr 50M for the experiments, along with a reduction in CERN's budget, pushed the completion date from 2005 to April 2007. The superconducting magnets were responsible for SFr 180M of the <b>cost</b> <b>increase.</b> There were also further costs and delays due to engineering difficulties encountered while building the underground cavern for the Compact Muon Solenoid, and also due to magnet supports which were insufficiently strongly designed and failed their initial testing (2007) and damage from a magnet quench and liquid helium escape (inaugural testing, 2008) (see: Construction accidents and delays). Due to lower electricity costs during the summer, the LHC normally does not operate over the winter months, although exceptions over the 2009/10 and 2012/2013 winters were made {{to make up for}} the 2008 start-up delays and to improve precision of measurements of the new particle discovered in 2012, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} {{was handled}} via the United States foreign military sales program, {{which in turn}} contracted McDonnell Douglas. Costs for the conversion were initially estimated at $89.5million (FY 1994). The aircraft was to be equipped with both a boom and a probe and drogue system. However, because McDonnell Douglas {{did not have any}} experience with the requested Remote Aerial Refueling Operator (RARO) system, and because the third aircraft differed from the original two, the program could not be completed at budget. By omitting the probe and drogue system and a fixed partition wall between the cargo and passenger, the cost could be limited at $96million. To make up for the <b>cost</b> <b>increase</b> McDonnell Douglas hired Dutch companies to do part of the work. The actual converting of the aircraft was done by KLM. Conversion of the aircraft was done from October 1994 to September 1995 for the first aircraft and from February to December 1995 for the second. This was much longer than planned, mostly because McDonnell Douglas delivered the parts late. This would have again increased the cost, but in the contract for the AH-64 Apaches which the Royal Netherlands Air Force also bought from McDonnell Douglas, the price was agreed to be kept at $96million.|$|E

25|$|The line's cost totaled $715.3 million, with $334.3 million {{coming from}} the federal government. This is {{considerably}} higher than initial budgets predictedthe figure was about $400 million in 1997. Opponents to the rail line state that it went far over-budget, but supporters of the line state that extensions of the route and other alterations, plus the impact of inflation, are the real reasons for the increased cost. Initial designs cut out the last stop in downtown, and {{the southern end of}} the line did not quite connect to the Mall of America. The Warehouse District stop was added early but another <b>cost</b> <b>increase</b> came from approximately $40 million to enhance the line (while construction was in progress) to bring the line directly into the Mall of America's transit hub. It was completed later than what was initially hoped for (a lot of literature points to 2003 as the opening year), but the mall connection was a significant contribution to the extra time requirements. These extensions are also why the line was initially reported to be 11.6 miles long, but ended up being 12 miles in length. The Target Field extension in 2009 added a few more tenths to the length.|$|E

30|$|The first factor, {{geographical}} {{spread of}} the customers, is statistically significant. For clustered customers, the total <b>costs</b> <b>increase</b> with 11 % on average when allowing customers to select a delivery time window.

For randomly spread customers, the total <b>costs</b> <b>increase</b> with 24 % on average. When customers are clustered the <b>increase</b> in <b>costs</b> is less than when customers are randomly spread because when customers are spread more randomly probably more distance is needed to travel to another customer with a close delivery time window.|$|R

In December 1971, GSA announced {{that the cost of}} the building had risen by $7 million in the past year (to $109 million) due to inflation, a major design change, and the cost of the building's unusual features. The design change added [...] of office space, but also included special blast-proof paving around the building. Just a month later, in January 1972, GSA reported that the cost of the building had risen to $126.108 million. A new completion date of July 1974 was also announced. GSA later capped the building's cost at $126.108 million in August 1972. The agency blamed the <b>cost</b> <b>increase</b> on inflation; the use of different contracts for excavation, substructure construction, and superstructure construction; the construction of a pneumatic tube system, reinforced flooring, and a special fire detection and suppression system; and the unique requirements of the areas for the fingerprinting bureau.
