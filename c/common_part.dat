5|$|Dancing is {{a popular}} pastime in Wales; {{traditional}} dances include folk dancing and clog dancing. The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis, but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out; this is attributed {{to the influence of}} Nonconformists and their belief that any physical diversion was worthless and satanic, especially mixed dancing. These ancient dances, orally passed down, were almost single-handedly rescued by Lois Blake (1890–1974) who recorded them in numerous instruction pamphlets, recording both steps and music. In a similar vein, clog dancing was preserved and developed by the likes of Howel Wood (1882–1967) who perpetuated the art at local and national stages. Clog dancing, traditionally a male dominated art, is now a <b>common</b> <b>part</b> of eisteddfodau. In 2010, a 30-year traditional dance festival held in Caernarvon came to an end {{due to a lack of}} participants, though clog dancing has seen a revival in the 21st century.|$|E

40|$|Plagiarism {{is a form}} of {{academic}} misconduct which has increased with the easy access to obtain information through electronic documents and the Internet. The problem of finding document plagiarism in full text document {{can be viewed as a}} problem of finding the longest <b>common</b> <b>parts</b> of strings. Moreover, the detection system has to be capable to determine and visualize not only the <b>common</b> <b>parts</b> but also the location of the <b>common</b> <b>parts</b> in both the source and the observed document. Unlike previous research, this paper proposes a numerical based comparison algorithm that is comparable in the computation time without loosing the word order of <b>common</b> <b>parts.</b> Based on the experiment, the proposed algorithm outperforms the suffix tree in the length of observed paragraph below one hundred words...|$|R

Death rates had surpassed 15.6 fatalities per 100 million vehicle-miles and were continuing to climb.|$|E
25|$|Bondage can be {{relatively}} simple to apply, enabling improvisation using household items and little experience. Bedroom bondage is usually mild bondage, with one partner voluntarily {{being put into}} restraints by being tied up or handcuffed. Blindfolds are a <b>common</b> <b>part</b> of bedroom play. The restrained partner is then typically sexually stimulated by masturbation, fingering, oral sex, a vibrator, or intercourse. Bondage {{can also be used}} for purposes other than sexual foreplay. For example, it may be used in erotic tickling or for sexual teasing.|$|E

25|$|Hummus is a <b>common</b> <b>part</b> of {{everyday}} meals in Israel. Apart from being {{included in the}} Mizrahi Jewish cuisine, a significant reason for the popularity of hummus in Israel {{is that it is}} made from ingredients that, following Kashrut (Jewish dietary laws), can be combined with both meat and dairy meals. It is seen as almost equally popular among Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs. Though not a traditional Jewish food, it is sufficiently popular in Israel to be found in numerous hummus-only restaurants across the country and is regarded as a national food.|$|E
25|$|As {{members of}} the Venturing section are the eldest in the association, the onus is on the youth members to plan, organise and {{participate}} in events. Lead Scouters only act in an advisory capacity. The Scout method drives the programme. Most Groups meet on a weekly basis, though some meet less frequently, in order to organise activities. Common activities include hiking, rockclimbing, mountaineering and Scout skills like camping and pioneering. Another <b>common</b> <b>part</b> of the programme is leadership, with Venture Scouts assuming {{a leadership role in}} the younger sections of Scouting Ireland. In Venture Scouting the only limit to the range of activities is the limit on the group's own imagination, so programmes vary widely from group to group.|$|E

Works from the Gor series by John Norman, and naturally all the works of Patrick Califia, Gloria Brame, the group Samois {{and many of the}} writer Georges Bataille (Histoire de l'oeil-Story of the Eye, Madame Edwarda, 1937), as well as Bob Flanagan: Slave Sonnets (1986), Fuck Journal (1987), A Taste of Honey (1990).

500|$|Christian {{views on}} alcohol are varied. Throughout the first 1,800 years of Church history, Christians {{generally}} consumed alcoholic beverages as a <b>common</b> <b>part</b> {{of everyday life}} and used [...] "the fruit of the vine" [...] in their central rite—the Eucharist or Lord's Supper. They held that both the Bible and Christian tradition taught that alcohol is a gift from God that makes life more joyous, but that over-indulgence leading to drunkenness is sinful {{or at least a}} vice.|$|E
500|$|Not all pain yields {{completely}} to classic analgesics, and {{drugs that are}} not traditionally considered analgesics but which reduce pain in some cases, such as steroids or bisphosphonates, may be employed concurrently with analgesics at any stage.

[...] Such adjuvants are a <b>common</b> <b>part</b> of palliative care and are used by up to 90 percent of people with cancer as they approach death.

500|$|The {{church in}} the background, {{identified}} as the Sint-Anna Church at Dilbeek in modern Belgium, has sparked much commentary. [...] One view holds {{that the church is}} evidence of the painting's moralistic intent—that while the first two blind men stumble and are beyond redemption, the other four are behind the church and thus may be saved. [...] Another interpretation has it that the church, with a withered tree placed before it, is an anti-Catholic symbol, and that those who follow it will fall following a blind leader as do the men in the ditch. [...] Others deny any symbolism in the church, noting that churches frequently appear in Bruegel's village scenes as they were a <b>common</b> <b>part</b> of the village landscape. [...] Medical researcher ZeynelA. Karcioglu suggests the church represents indifference to the plight of the handicapped.|$|E

500|$|The day {{begins with}} special prayers for the integrity, solidarity, and {{development}} of Pakistan in mosques and religious places across the country. Citizens attending independence day parades and other events are usually dressed in Pakistan’s official colours, green and white. Many people meet their friends and relatives, dine over Pakistani food, and visit recreational spots to mark the holiday. Public functions including elaborate firework shows, street parades, seminars, televised transmissions, music and poetry contests, children's shows and art exhibitions are a <b>common</b> <b>part</b> of the celebrations. Along with flag hoisting, the national anthem is sung at various government places, schools, residences, and monuments on the day, and patriotic slogans such as Pakistan Zindabad are raised. Musical concerts and dance performances are arranged {{both inside and outside}} the country, featuring popular artists. Homage is paid to the people who lost their lives during the migration and riots which followed independence in 1947, as well as martyrs of the Pakistan Army and recipients of Nishan-e-Haider, and political figures, famous artists and scientists.|$|E
