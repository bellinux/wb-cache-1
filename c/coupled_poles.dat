40|$|We {{present an}} {{explicit}} {{construction of the}} special part of the three gluon vertex, which incorporates the Schwinger mechanism into the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the gluon propagator, enabling the generation of a dynamical gluon mass. This vertex contains massless, longitudinally <b>coupled</b> <b>poles,</b> acting effectively as composite Nambu-Goldstone bosons, generated by the strong QCD dynamics. The basic ingredients required for this construction are the longitudinal nature of this vertex and the Slavnov-Taylor identities that it must satisfy, in order for gauge-invariance and BRST symmetry to remain intact {{in the presence of}} a gluon mass.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{holographic}} dual of fermions interacting in a Schwarzschild-AdS_d+ 1 background via a dipole (Pauli) coupling sourced by a probe gauge field. We find quite generally that a gap {{forms in the}} dual operator spectrum as the Pauli coupling is strengthened. Previous investigations have observed this behavior in analogous constructions with Reissner-Nordström-AdS (RN-AdS_ 4) backgrounds, but the emergence of log-oscillatory behavior in those models' spectra prevented identification of the underlying gapping mechanism. Our model obviates this issue through its modified geometry and traces the gapping mechanism back to the bulk dynamics. We show in general {{that there is a}} duality between zeros for large positive values of the <b>coupling</b> and <b>poles</b> in the spectrum for equivalent couplings but with opposite sign as seen recently in the RN-AdS_ 4 backgroundalsup. The duality arises from the two possible quantizations for computing the retarded propagator. Coupled with the earlier string resultsgauntlett,gubser 2 that Fermi surfaces are generally absent from the spectral function, our finding that the Pauli term engineers the gap suggests that the model examined here offers a way of studying non-perturbative physics in fermionic matter at finite density typified by Mott insulating systems.
