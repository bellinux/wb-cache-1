40|$|From 1865 to 1878 {{the dispute}} over French rights in Newfoundland {{included}} the question of Newfoundland included the question of Newfoundland territorial control over the French Shore {{as well as the}} older controversy concerning exclusive and <b>concurrent</b> <b>rights</b> in the fishery. This newer aspect of the French Shore Question partially resulted from the intense competition between France and Newfoundland in the fishery. [...] After 1815 the French had established a prosperous fishery off Newfoundland based on the Islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon and on the French Shore. This state-supported industry by creating strong competition for Newfoundland fishery products in world markets threatened the colony’s one-product economy. Newfoundland had retaliated at first by legislation aimed at restricting the French fishery. When this failed, an effort was made to provide alternative sources of employment of an expanding population by developing the other resources of the island. As the French Shore was considered a prime region for development, Newfoundlanders, since about 1850, had been trying to extend government and industry to this area. Between 1865 and 1878 this effort was characterized by the demand of the Newfoundland government for the right to appoint magistrates and grant land on the shore. The Imperial government, worried over possible French reaction, at first refused both these demands. Instead, hoping to satisfy the colonists while avoiding any dispute with France, they proposed in 1868 the resumption of the fishery negotiations which had been suspended in 1861. The French proved reluctant but eventually agreed in July, 1873. But the Miller-Boissoudy discussions which followed failed to produce any agreement. Together with the persistent agitation in Newfoundland this led the British in 1878 to make a concession in principle to the colony by appointing a magistrate on the French Shore. When F. B. T. Carter retired as Premier that year, the over optimistic impression in Newfoundland was that his negotiations with the Imperial government had solved the question of British territorial rights on the French Shore...|$|E

40|$|Until recently, the {{principles}} of secularism, religious pluralism and state neutrality have been perceived in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) as partially overlapping concepts. However, in Lautsi and others v. Italy, the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR has – in a landmark decision – qualified the interplay between these ideas. This essay will argue that Lautsi v. Italy signals {{a turning point in}} the previous ECtHR jurisprudence, which often associated secularism with the protection of pluralism and democracy. There are two main consequences of the decision. Firstly, the ECtHR recognised that a state's neutrality cannot be deductively constructed as a logical manifestation of secularism. For instance, in Sahin v. Turkey, the Grand Chamber explicitly embraced the narrative of the Turkish Constitutional Court that allied secularism with a defence of pluralism. Secondly, in Lautsi v. Italy, the ECtHR recognised the epistemic implications of pluralism. Pluralism as a legal concept demands the recognition of diversity and the acceptance of a dialogue that transforms a multitude of legal orders (and a plurality of perceptions of the good life represented by such a multitude), in procedures aimed at accommodating concurring individual rights. I argue that the recognition of pluralism and the democratic practices that qualify that pluralism should be a point of departure for the jurisprudence of the ECtHR in areas such as the display of religious symbols in classrooms. This approach serves as an alternative to the practice of balancing rights, which greatly restricts the breadth of religious freedom and de jure imposes a monist conception of rational thinking. The essay will be divided into three sections, preceded by an introduction and followed by a conclusion. The first part will discuss how the antagonistic relationship between theism and secularism in Italy has shaped the issues of religious symbols in the schoolroom. I will argue that concurring views of the significance of symbols have historically been part of Italy's cultural heritage and that there are strong indications that such a democratic dialogue will continue without a definitive solution being reached. In the second section, I will explain the benefits of accepting pluralism as a criterion for assessing the extent of religious freedom in signatory states. A short third section will suggest a procedure that democratically accommodates <b>concurrent</b> <b>rights.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|Changing between {{cognitive}} tasks {{requires a}} reorganization of cognitive processes. Behavioural evidence suggests this {{can occur in}} advance of the stimulus. However, the existence or detectability of an anticipatory task-set reconfiguration process remains controversial, in part because several neuroimaging studies have not detected extra brain activity during preparation for a task switch relative to a task repeat. In contrast, electrophysiological studies have identified potential correlates of preparation for a task switch, but their interpretation is hindered by the scarcity of evidence on their relationship to performance. We aimed to: (i) identify the brain potential(s) reflecting effective preparation for a task-switch in a task-cuing paradigm that shows clear behavioural evidence for advance preparation, and (ii) characterize this activity by means of temporal segmentation and source analysis. Our results show that when advance preparation was effective (as indicated by fast responses), a protracted switch-related component, manifesting itself as widespread posterior positivity and <b>concurrent</b> <b>right</b> anterior negativity, preceded stimulus onset for 300 ms, with sources primarily in the left lateral frontal, right inferior frontal and temporal cortices. When advance preparation was ineffective (as implied by slow responses), or made impossible by a short cue–stimulus interval (CSI), a similar component, with lateral prefrontal generators, peaked 300 ms poststimulus. The protracted prestimulus component (which we show to be distinct from P 3 or contingent negative variation, CNV) also correlated over subjects with a behavioural measure of preparation. Furthermore, its differential lateralization for word and picture cues was consistent with a role for verbal self-instruction in preparatory task-set reconfiguration...|$|R

40|$|Perceived gaze in faces is an {{important}} social signal that may influence orienting of attention in normal observers. Would such effects of gaze still occur in patients with right parietal damage and left neglect who usually fail to attend to contralesional space? Two experiments tested for effects of perceived gaze on visual extinction. Face or shape stimuli were presented in the right, left, or both hemifields, with faces looking either straight ahead or toward the opposite field. On bilateral trials, patients extinguished a left shape much less often when a <b>concurrent</b> <b>right</b> face looked leftward rather than straight ahead. This occurred, even though gaze was not relevant to the task and processing of facial signals implied attention to a competing ipsilesional stimulus. By contrast, rightward gaze in faces presented {{on the left side}} had no effect on extinction, suggesting that gaze cues are not extracted without attention. Two other experiments examined effects of perceived gaze on the detection of peripheral targets. Targets appeared at one of four possible locations to the right or left of a central face looking either toward the target location, another location on the same side, the opposite side, or straight ahead. Face and gaze were not relevant to the task and not predictive of target location. Patients responded faster when the face looked toward the target on both the contralesional and ipsilesional sides. In contralesional space, gaze allowed shifting of attention in a specific quadrant direction, but only to the first target along the scan path when there were different possible locations on the same side. By contrast, in intact ipsilesional space, attention was selectively directed to one among different eccentric locations. Control experiments showed that symbolic arrow cues did not produce similar effects.

40|$|For {{millions}} of Indigenous peoples {{around the world}} their own customary laws (nonstate laws they consider binding upon them) are their primary, if not their only source of law. Long marginalized and where recognized considered to lie on {{the lowest level of}} the legal hierarchy, the status of indigenous peoplesÂ¿ legal systems and most importantly of their customary laws changed dramatically in the twenty years between 1990 and 2010. During this period advances in national and international law and jurisprudence has clearly recognised the rights of Indigenous peoples to be governed by their own legal regimes and the obligation of states to respect and recognise their laws and institutions and the ancestral rights they uphold. The thesis that this study proposes is that states are legally obliged to give due respect and recognition to the customary laws of Indigenous peoples in order to secure the full and effective realization of their human rights, and that these obligations and the <b>concurrent</b> <b>right</b> of Indigenous peoples to be governed by their own laws, customs and traditions are recognised principles of customary international law. In order to prove this thesis attention is given to the historic status of customary law, its role in regulating and securing the rights of Indigenous peoples to their lands, territories, resources, traditional knowledge, cultural heritage, and self- determination. Examination is made {{of a wide range of}} customary law experiences ranging from the national to the local level and addressing key issues such as: the nature, status and characteristics of customary law; proof of customary law; its role in failing states; application to conflicts with private sector actors; place in tribal adjudication systems; role in the regulation and enforcement of contractual arrangements; and its influence on dominant legal regimes. The sty shows that customary law, far from being an archaic and quaint system of law existing on the margins and of little interest and less importance to the mainstream legal system, is a vibrant and dynamic body of Â¿living lawÂ¿ which is vital for the realisation of Indigenous peoplesÂ¿ human rights and a crucial element of any system of good global governance The study concludes that the body of international instruments, jurisprudence of the courts and treaty bodies, state practice and opinio juris examined supports a finding that the thesis has been proved. 2016 - 02 - 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{power to}} {{interpret}} the Constitution is not vested solely in the judicial branch. Although Marbury v. Madison {{has been used to}} assert the preeminence of judicial review and elevate the judiciary to the status of 2 ̆ 2 ultimate interpreter of the Constitution, 2 ̆ 2 the Framers anticipated that all branches would have a 2 ̆ 2 <b>concurrent</b> <b>right</b> to expound the [C]onstitution. 2 ̆ 2 This decision left room for judicial deference to the political branches. However, the judicial branch wields a potent weapon in the exercise of its authority as the courts alone determine when they should defer to another branch or exercise judicial review. The thin line between judicial deference and judicial review is manned exclusively by the justices of the courts. The political question doctrine is one of the methods for abstaining from the exercise of judicial review. Like other justiciability doctrines such as standing, ripeness, or mootness, the political question doctrine provides the courts with a means to avoid deciding a case on its merits. Although the doctrine was originally tied exclusively to the text of the Constitution, the current doctrine has evolved into two different strands: the classical version and the prudential version. The original, or classical strand, is tied to the determination of whether an issue has been committed to another branch of government or whether an act of another branch exceeds the authority committed to that branch. The prudential strand, on the other hand, suggests that the courts should abstain from judicial review {{in order to protect the}} courts 2 ̆ 7 legitimacy, to circumvent legitimizing a questionable policy choice by another branch, and to avoid disputes with the political branches. The ostensible purpose of both the classical strand and the prudential strand of the doctrine is to provide the courts with methods for avoiding a decision on the merits of the case, albeit for different purposes. Although the political question doctrine was fully explicated by the U. S. Supreme Court in Baker v. Carr almost fifty years ago, the Nebraska Supreme Court first made use of the doctrine in Nebraska Coalition for Educational Equity 2 ̆ 6 Adequacy v. Heineman in 2007. In Coalition, the Nebraska Supreme Court addressed a constitutional challenge to the adequacy of Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s funding system for education, holding that the challenge was a non-justiciable political question under four of the criteria articulated by the U.

5000|$|Relations {{between the}} French and Irish {{settlers}} were ambivalent. The settlers served as protectors of the French property and George Casey reports {{that many of}} them were bilingual. The population grew rapidly and by 1867 a school was reported operating in Conche. Although there were <b>concurrent</b> fishing <b>rights</b> on the French Shore, the settlers, who were allowed to settle at Conche by the French, complained frequently that the French infringed on their lucrative salmon fishery. The French Admirals repeatedly warned the gardiens about their incursions into French fishing territory and English captains frequently investigated complaints and incidents on behalf of both parties. A typical report was a Captain Hamilton's dispatch in July 1864: at Conche he inquired about Facey, a settler son had interfered with French cod seines. and about another settler named Bromley whose stages extensions interfered with the French rooms. The captain concluded that [...] "This is the only place I have visited where a really ill-feeling exists between English and French, owing in a great measure to the English being prevented from putting down salmon nets, it being an excellent salmon post". Incidents continued although they seemed minor enough: In 1875, the captain of a French brig complained that John Casey and other inhabitants had [...] "stripped" [...] his ship; however the investigating British officer concluded [...] "on the whole I believe, the fisherman of the two nations get on well together". In 1876 it was reported that the last French fishing rooms had been abandoned in 1867, however, the French based at La Scie continued to fish in the area, mainly cod, squid and herring, while by 1874 the 180 Conche settlers had exclusive use of the harbour from which they continued to prosecute the lucrative salmon fishery. It was reported that [...] "Conche is a great bay for salmon, and as the French do not interfere, it is the principal fishery.... The total catch was quoted ... at from two hundred to two thousand barrels". Settlers listed at this time were Joy, Kenney, Casey, Pine, Carroll, Kearsey, Hunt, Dower, Fitzpatrick, Ralph, Byrne, Linfield, Bromley, Martin, Flinn, and Flynn.

The current experiment examined frontal lobe regulatory control of glucose in high and low hostile men with concurrent left frontal lobe (Control Oral Word Association Test [verbal]) or right frontal lobe (Ruff Figural Fluency Test [nonverbal]) stress. A significant interaction was found for Group × Condition, F (1, 22) =  4.16, p ≤ . 05 with glucose levels (mg/dl) of high hostile men significantly elevated {{as a function of}} the right frontal stressor (M =  101.37, SD =  13.75) when compared to the verbal stressor (M =  95.79, SD =  11.20). Glucose levels in the low hostile group remained stable for both types of stress. High hostile men made significantly more errors on the right frontal but not the left frontal stressor (M =  17.18, SD =  19.88) when compared to the low hostile men (M =  5.81, SD =  4.33). These findings support our existing frontal capacity model of hostility (Iribarren et al., in J Am Med Assoc 17 (19): 2546 – 2551, 2000; McCrimmon et al., in Physiol Behav 67 (1): 35 – 39, 1999; Brunner et al., in Diabetes Care 21 (4): 585 – 590, 1998), extending the role of the right frontal lobe to regulatory control over glucose mobilization.|$|R
40|$|Distributed {{programming}} is usually considered both difficult and inherently different from concurrent centralized programming. It {{is thought that}} the distributed programming systems that we ultimately deploy, in the future, when we've worked out all the details, will require a very different programming model and will even need to be evaluated by new criteria. The Mozart Programming System, described in this thesis, demonstrates that this need not be the case. It is shown that, with a good system design, distributed programming {{can be seen as}} an extended form of concurrent programming. This is from the programmer's point-of-view; under the hood the design and implementation will necessarily be more complex. We relate the Mozart system with the classical transparencies of distributed systems. We show that some of these are inherently on the application level, while as Mozart demonstrates, others can and should be dealt with on the language/system level. The extensions to the programming model, given the <b>right</b> <b>concurrent</b> programming base, are mainly concerned with non-functional properties of programs. The models and tuning facilities for failure and performance need to take latency, bandwidth, and partial failure into account. Other than that there need not be any difference between concurrent programming and distributed programming. The Mozart Programming System is based on the concurrent programming language Oz, which integrates, in a coherent way, all three known concurrency or thread-interaction models. These are message-passing (like Erlang), shared objects (like Java with threads) and shared data-flow variables. The Mozart design philosophy is thus applicable over the entire range of concurrent programming languages/systems. We have extracted from the experience with Mozart a number of principles and properties that are applicable to the design and implementation of all (general-purpose) distributed programming systems. The full range of the design and implementation issues behind Mozart are presented. This includes a description of the consistency protocols that make transparency possible for the full language, including distributed objects and distributed data-flow variables. Mozart is extensively compared with other approaches to distributed programming, in general, and to other language-based distributed programming systems, in particular.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the present study is twofold (1) analyze the impacts of {{institutions}} and private property rights on the banking industry, and (2) the effects of property rights, contracting rights and intellectual property <b>rights</b> <b>concurrent</b> to privatization of state owned enterprises {{on a wide range of}} industries. First, it uses a sample of 37 countries to assess the effects privatization on industry growth of output, value added and establishments with regards to property rights institutions, using 3 SLS technique. Consistent with the law and finance view, our results show that privatization works better in settings with better contracting, patents, and IPRs laws to foster industry growth. The results suggest that least developed countries can accelerate the growth of their industrial sector by structurally bettering their legal institutions to benefit from their privatization programs. There is strong evidence of structural unemployment in sectors that are more capital intensive; privatization has a crowding out effect channeled through financial development. The results have broad implications vis-à-vis policy choices for institutional reforms specifically in terms of control of corruption, enhancing property rights, contracting rights, and IRPs protection for privatization to bear fruits. Second, this study assumes that banks in countries with infective institutions operate in a highly risky environment, which is reflected in the interest rates spread, loan quality, and net interest margin. It investigates the relationships between banks and institutions using seemingly unrelated regressions and data from 79 countries. It shows that institutional improvements abate inefficiencies in the banking sector, reduce obstacles to external finance, and improve the quality of bank loan portfolios. Specifically, had a country in the 25 th percentile of the institutional quality index, depth of credit information, and the spread improved its value to the mean sample of these variables, banks in that country would have had an annual decrease of 2. 24 % in net interest margin, 1. 57 % in unpaid loans, and 0. 822 basis points in the spread. Other institutions including private and public registries are effective in improving access to external finance. Importantly, information on borrowers past loan repayment patterns significantly decreases the spreads only when controlled for predated institutional quality. This finding highlights the significance of institution-building especially in countries where sudden power shifts result into pendular swings in public policies. Third, using three independent samples to investigate the institutional factors affecting the performance of the banking sector around the world, this study finds that financial effects of three sets of institutions including private creditors’ right, property rights, and institutional quality on bank performance are strong. It uses SEM technique to show that better quality of institutions is negatively related to bank profitability while private creditors’ right and property rights institutions are positively related to bank profitability...|$|R
50|$|SR 49 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with SR 45 (Plains Highway) {{at a point}} about 5.6 mi north of Dawson, in Terrell County. It heads to the northeast and crosses over Kinchafoonee Creek into Sumter County. The highway continues to the northeast. In Croxton Crossroads is an intersection with SR 308. It curves to the north past Koinonia Community Lake. The route then curves back to the north-northeast and intersects US 280/SR 27 southwest of Americus. The three highways run concurrently to the northeast. Approximately 4000 ft later, US 19/SR 3 (South Martin Luther King Boulevard) join the concurrency. Immediately, the five routes enter Americus. About 3000 ft later, US 19/SR 3 split off to the northeast on North Martin Luther King Boulevard, while US 280/SR 27/SR 49 turn to the east on West Lamar Street. On {{the east side of}} town, SR 49 departs to the north on Tripp Street and meets the westbound lanes of US 280/SR 27/SR 49 (Forsyth Street), before heading northeast again. It passes Argo Lake and the Jimmy Carter Regional Airport on its way out of town. Before leaving the county, the highway passes John James Lake, Tharpe Lake, and Charles Reeves Lake. Then, it curves to the north and meets the northern terminus of SR 195 (Bailey Avenue). About 2000 ft farther to the north, it begins to run along the Sumter-Macon county line and passes through the western part of Andersonville National Historic Site and east of the town of Andersonville. Then, it crosses into Macon County proper and resumes its northeastern routing, passing through the extreme northern part of the historic site. The route passes through Clearview, before approaching Oglethorpe. Just southwest of town, is an intersection with SR 26 and SR 49 Truck/SR 128. At this intersection, SR 49/SR 49 Truck/SR 128 head northeast into town concurrently. They meet the southern terminus of SR 128 Bypass (West Bypass) and pass Oglethorpe Cemetery. At Sumter Street, they intersect SR 90; SR 90/SR 128 head to the northwest, and SR 49/SR 90 curve to the east. They cross over the Flint River and enter Montezuma. At Dooly Street, the two routes divide, with SR 90 heading south-southwest and SR 49 heading to the north-northeast. SR 49 passes through rural areas of the county and has a concurrency with SR 127 that ends in Marshallville. A little farther to the north-northeast, the highway runs along the Macon-Peach county line before entering Peach County proper. It continues to the northeast, toward Fort Valley. Just before entering town, it meets the western terminus of University Boulevard, which leads to Fort Valley State University and serves as a southern bypass route of town. In Fort Valley, the highway passes Oak Lawn Cemetery, before entering the main part of town. There, it intersects US 341/SR 7/SR 96 (Oakland Heights Parkway). In the northeastern part of town, SR 49 passes Peach Regional Medical Center, before it leaves town. Then, it meets the eastern terminus of SR 49 Connector (Buddy Reddick Memorial Parkway). From this intersection, the next 9.8 mi of road is part of the Fall Line Freeway, an expressway that connects Columbus and Augusta. Northeast of Fort Valley, SR 49 passes the Pine Needles Country Club. In Powersville, it meets the western terminus of SR 247 Connector (Centerville Road). In Byron, it meets the eastern terminus of SR 42, before having an interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75), where the Fall Line Freeway departs to the north. The highway continues to the northeast and runs along the Peach-Houston county line. Almost immediately after its county line section, it intersects US 41/SR 11. The three routes head concurrently to the northeast on Industrial Highway. Then, they enter Houston County, where they pass Vinsons Lake. Slightly to the northeast, they cross over Echeconnee Creek into Bibb County. The concurrent routes pass northwest of Middle Georgia Regional Airport, before curving to the north. Approximately 1.5 mi south of Macon, US 129/SR 247 (Hawkinsville Road) join the concurrency. The five highways cross over the Tobesofkee and Rocky Creek and enter Macon. Just over 1000 ft into the city, is a major intersection. US 41/SR 247 (Pio Nono Avenue) head northwest to the left, Houston Avenue heads north straight ahead, and US 129/SR 11/SR 49 (Broadway) head north-northeast to the <b>right,</b> <b>concurrent</b> with US 41 Business. The four highways continue to an intersection with US 80/SR 22 (Eisenhower Parkway), which join the concurrency. They head northeast into {{the main part of the}} city. At Walnut Street, US 41 Business/SR 22/SR 49 head northwest, while US 80/US 129/SR 11 continue to the northeast. At 2nd Street, SR 22 splits off to the northeast, while US 41 Business/SR 49 continue to the northwest and intersect SR 19. Here, US 41 Business travels to the southwest and west concurrent with SR 19, while SR 19/SR 49 head northeast. Two blocks later, they intersect US 23/US 129/SR 11/SR 87. At this intersection, US 23/US 129/SR 11/SR 19/SR 49 head northeast and cross over the Ocmulgee River. On the northern side of the river is an interchange with I-16. Immediately afterward, US 23/SR 19 split off to the east onto Emery Highway, while US 129/SR 11/SR 49 continue to the northeast. Approximately 1000 ft later, SR 22 rejoins the concurrency. The four highways continue northeast until SR 49 departs to the east on Shurling Drive. It cuts across a corner of Jones County before re-entering Bibb County. The highway passes Bowden Golf Course and enters Jones County again. It passes through rural areas of the county and intersects SR 18 in Greenberry Crossroads. The highway continues to the northeast and enters Baldwin County. It runs along the Milledgeville-Midway-Hardwick city line, where it intersects US 441/SR 29 (West Bypass Road). Then, the highway curves to the northwest, crossing over Fishing Creek into Milledgeville city proper. SR 49 passes Central City Park and then intersects US 441 Business/SR 243 (Clark Street) on the southwestern corner of Georgia College & State University. A few blocks farther to the east-northeast, it meets its northern terminus, an intersection with SR 22/SR 24. At this intersection, SR 112 (South Elbert Street) also terminates.|$|R
