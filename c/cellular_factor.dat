40|$|We {{and others}} have {{described}} the use of genome-wide screenings for <b>cellular</b> <b>factors</b> that contribute to HIV- 1 replication [1, 2]. One aspect of the HIV- 1 life cycle important to viral replication is the post-transcriptional regulation of HIV- 1 gene expression. In HIV- 1 biology, a key step in gene expression is the post-transcriptional export of intron-containing viral RNAs which bypass the normal mechanism(s) that retain cellular intron-containing RNAs in the nucleus. Specific signals on the viral RNAs, such as instability sequences (INS) and Rev responsive element (RRE), are binding sites for viral and <b>cellular</b> <b>factors</b> that serve to regulate RNA-export. The HIV- 1 encoded viral Rev protein binds to the RRE found on unspliced and incompletely spliced viral RNAs. Binding by Rev directs the export of these RNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

The EBNA 2 protein acts as a transcriptional activator of several viral and cellular genes. For the TP 1 promoter, we have shown previously that an EBNA 2 -responsive element (EBNA 2 RE) between - 258 and - 177 relative to the TP 1 RNA start site is necessary and sufficient for EBNA 2 -mediated transactivation and that it binds EBNA 2 through a <b>cellular</b> <b>factor.</b> To define the critical cis elements within this region, we cloned EBNA 2 RE mutants in front of the TP 1 minimal promoter fused to the reporter gene for luciferase. Transactivation by EBNA 2 was tested by transfection of these mutants in the absence and presence of an EBNA 2 expression vector into the established B-cell line BL 41 -P 3 HR- 1. The analysis revealed that two identical 11 -bp motifs and the region 3 ' of the second 11 -bp motif are essential for transactivation by EBNA 2. Methylation interference experiments indicated that the same <b>cellular</b> <b>factor</b> in the absence of EBNA 2 binds either one (complex I) or both (complex III) 11 -bp motifs with different affinities, giving rise to two different specific protein-DNA complexes within the left-hand 54 bp of EBNA 2 RE.

Analysis of this EBNA 2 -containing complex revealed the same protection pattern as for complex III, indicating that EBNA 2 interacts with DNA through binding of the cellular protein to the 11 -bp motifs.

To improve this situation, we performed comprehensive, proteomics-based screens to identify <b>cellular</b> <b>factors</b> associated with the native vRNP and viral polymerase complexes. Reconstituted vRNPs were purified from human cells using Strep-tagged viral nucleoprotein (NP-Strep) as bait, and co-purified <b>cellular</b> <b>factors</b> were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). In parallel, reconstituted native influenza A polymerase complexes were isolated using tandem affinity purification (TAP) -tagged polymerase subunits as bait, and co-purified <b>cellular</b> <b>factors</b> were again identified by MS. Using these techniques, we identified 41 proteins that co-purified with NP-Strep-enriched vRNPs and four cellular proteins that co-purified with the viral polymerase complex. Two of the polymerase-associated factors, importin-beta 3 and PARP- 1, represent novel interaction partners. Most cellular proteins previously shown to interact with either viral NP and/or vRNP were also identified using our method, demonstrating its sensitivity. Co-immunoprecipitation studies in virus-infected cells using selected novel interaction partners, including nucleophosmin (NPM), confirmed their association with vRNP. Immunofluorescence analysis further revealed that NPM is recruited to sites of viral transcription and replication in infected cells. Additionally, overexpression of NPM resulted in increased viral polymerase activity, indicating its role in viral RNA synthesis.

The twofold effect was seen whether the region containing the cores and LVb site was present or not.

We have analyzed the shutoff of host protein synthesis in cells infected with a mixture of the wt HSV- 1 (KOS) and the vhs- 1 mutant virus. The results of these experiments revealed that (i) the wt virus shutoff activity requires a threshold level of input virions per cell and (ii) the mutant vhs- 1 virus protein can irreversibly block the wt virus shutoff activity. These results are consistent with a stoichiometric model in which the wt vhs protein interacts with a <b>cellular</b> <b>factor</b> which controls the half-life of cell mRNA.

40|$|A general {{theme that}} has emerged from studies of DNA tumor viruses is that {{otherwise}} unrelated oncoproteins encoded by these viruses often target the same important cellular factors. Major oncogenic determinants for human adenovirus type 9 (Ad 9) and high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the E 4 -ORF 1 and E 6 oncoproteins, respectively, and although otherwise unrelated, both of these viral proteins possess a functional PDZ domain-binding motif that is essential for their transforming activity and for binding to the PDZ domain-containing and putative tumor suppressor protein DLG. We report here that the PDZ domain-binding motifs of Ad 9 E 4 -ORF 1 and high-risk HPV- 18 E 6 also mediate binding to the widely expressed <b>cellular</b> <b>factor</b> MUPP 1, a large multi-PDZ domain protein predicted to function as an adapter in signal transduction. With regard to the consequences of these interactions in cells, we showed that Ad 9 E 4 -ORF 1 aberrantly sequesters MUPP 1 within the cytoplasm of cells whereas HPV- 18 E 6 targets this cellular protein for degradation. These effects were specific because mutant viral proteins unable to bind MUPP 1 lack these activities. From these results, we propose that the multi-PDZ domain protein MUPP 1 is involved in negatively regulating cellular proliferation and that the transforming activities of two different viral oncoproteins depend, in part, {{on their ability to}} inactivate this <b>cellular</b> <b>factor...</b>|$|E

Notably, the chimeric gag LV efficiently transduced primary simian hematopoietic progenitor cells, a critical cellular target in gene therapy. The alterations in the CyPA binding region did not affect CyPA incorporation; however, transduction by the gag chimeric LV seemed to be relatively insensitive to cyclosporin A, indicating that it does not require CyPA for early postentry steps. In dual infection experiments, the gag chimeric LV failed to remove the block to transduction of the WT LV, suggesting that the gag chimeric LV did not saturate the inhibitory simian <b>cellular</b> <b>factor.</b> These data suggest that the CyPA binding region of capsid contains a viral determinant involved in the postentry restriction of HIV- 1 -based lentiviral vectors.

We report here that a 70 -bp region between - 133 and - 64 is sufficient to confer cell cycle regulation on a heterologous promoter. The 20 -bp region between - 64 and - 83, which contains an inverted CCAAT motif, is important for transcriptional stimulation of this functional unit. The sequence of this CCAAT motif is nearly identical to the consensus sequence for the transcriptional factor CP 1. We also examined the specificity and binding activities of <b>cellular</b> <b>factors</b> interacting with the 70 -bp fragment. We showed that the <b>cellular</b> <b>factors</b> binding to the 70 -bp region are similar during the G 1, S, and G 2 phases, suggesting that the cell cycle regulatory activity observed must involve processes other than factor binding to the DNA...|$|R
