40|$|The {{purpose of}} modern surface {{hardening}} technology is obtaining reproducible, precisely planned {{parameters of the}} carburized layer, minimizing the negative phenomena that result in dimensional changes after hardening and {{making it possible to}} determine the nature and magnitude of these changes. This concerns mainly the concept of single-piece flow in heat treatment applied for the purposes of mass production, employing a special autonomous 4 D Quenching chamber for high pressure gas quenching (HPGQ). The main components of the 4 D Quenching chamber include a system of <b>cooling</b> <b>nozzles</b> surrounding the processed item and providing a uniform inflow of cooling gas from all directions (3 D) and a table rotating together with the item processed, contributing to uniform cooling (4 D). Within the framework of this paper there was studied the impact of gear wheel quenching in a 4 D Quenching chamber using nitrogen at pressure of 6 and 10 bar on changes in geometry. Geometric measurements of facewidth of gear, hole diameter and outside diameter were performed before and after carburization and quenching. The results obtained allowed us to determine the impact of quenching pressure inside a 4 D Quenching chamber on dimensional changes in gear wheels analyzed. The thermo-chemical treatment resulted in a decrease in outside diameters and hole diameters measured and an increase in facewidth of gears...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis presents research on upward pointing oil jets that provide cooling of downward facing heated surfaces. The specific purpose {{of this research is}} to improve understanding of the oil jet cooling of internal combustion engine pistons. In this research, the cooling of heated blocks with flat and concave surfaces was investigated. Temperature measurements were obtained using an array of thermocouples embedded inside the heated blocks. A flash illumination and high resolution CCD camera system was used to observe the liquid jet impingement. Observations identified a 'bell-sheet' flow pattern, jet interference, jet splatter and jet breakup which provided insights into the liquid jet impingement processes normally encountered on downwardfacing surfaces. Bespoke contracting-type nozzles were used to produce the jet flow structure. The data from these nozzles were used to generate new empirical correlations for oil jet cooling of downward-facing flat surfaces and for predicting the size 6 f impingement. The results obtained from these tests were also used for comparison with cooling jets from production automotive piston <b>cooling</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The research has demonstrated that the effectiveness of oil jet cooling can be affected by preheating the oil and varying the injector size to alter the targeted cooling efficiency, and liquid loss due to jet breakup and splatter. Local heat transfer coefficients were observed to increase when the jet Reynolds number increased. Piston undercrown cooling was studied using a range of oil jet configurations. The cooling rates improved with optimised targeted jets. The results also indicated that the undercrown geometry designs such as crosshatched surfaces, undercrown-skirt and gudgeon-pin boss, were significant for enhancing the local rate of forced convective heat transfer. New empirical correlations were developed from the experimental results that enabled prediction of the heat transfer coefficient and jet impingement size for high Prandtl number liquid jets impinging onto downward-facing surfaces. The heat transfer correlations were developed for normal (θ = 90 °) and inclined (θ = 75 °, 60 ° and 45 °) jet impingements...|$|E

Flame hardening of metals {{is the process of}} hardening steel by heating the surface of the specimen which is then followed by a rapid cooling {{on the surface of the}} specimen. The heating process was done by using a gas flame from oksiasetilen, while cooling using water pumped from the container vessel. Variations of torch distance with <b>cooling</b> <b>nozzle</b> was 20 mm, 40 mm, 60 mm and flow rate water variation was 1200 cc/minute and 2400 cc/minute [...] Type of flame which used was carburation flame which regulated by using valve of oxygen and valve of asitelen. The results show that in this study showed that the hardening depth of specimen with 60 mm torch distance and <b>cooler</b> <b>nozzle</b> variation was deeper than 40 mm and 20 mm distance variation. On the variation of 60 / 1200, hardening depth reaches 3, 6 mm, 40 / 1200 reaches 2 mm, and 20 / 1200 reaches 0, 7 mm.
