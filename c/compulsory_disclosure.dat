40|$|It {{may sound}} strange how {{corporate}} governance, essentially associated with compliance of statutory corporate regulations, {{can create a}} better world. The raison d’eter of setting up the World Council for Corporate Governance in 2000 was to shift the focus of corporate governance from compliance and <b>compulsory</b> <b>disclosures</b> to creating value for all stakeholders of the company. Our recent global conferences on social responsibility have shown that we {{have come a long}} way since then.

It was therefore only fit that the theme of this year’s conference is Creating a Better World Through Corporate Governance. With the increasing power of global business, the role of corporate governance has become much wider and is impacting every aspect of human life. The papers in the volume illustrate how good governance can secure a sustainable world, how markets can create and equitable society, how boards can drive social, environmental & ethical agenda, how corporations can alleviate poverty and raise profits, how companies can make money by cleaning up the planet and how boards can tap diversity and dissent.

50|$|Though {{the duty}} of {{confidentiality}} shares a common origin, goals, and similarities with legal professional privilege, they are distinct {{in at least three}} ways. Firstly, privilege is not dependent on a contractual, equitable or professional duty to clients. Rather, it is based upon arguments of public policy. Secondly, communications protected by confidentiality are more numerous than those protected by privilege. Privileged communications are a subset of confidential communication. Nonetheless, loss of privilege does not necessarily automatically destroy the duty to confidentiality if it has arisen independently of the privilege. Finally, privileged information is protected from <b>compulsory</b> <b>disclosure,</b> unless abrogated by statute or waived. Non-privileged confidential information on the other hand must be disclosed to judicial, statutory, or other legal compulsion. In particular, the public interest in discovering the truth trumps private duties to respect confidence.|$|E

Some commentators advocated replacement of the lower house's multiple-seat election district system with single-seat constituencies like those found in Britain and the United States. It was argued that the multiple-seat districts made election campaigning more expensive because party members from the same district had to compete among themselves for the votes of the same constituents. It was hoped that the smaller size of single-seat districts would also reduce the expense of staff, offices, and constituent services. Critics argued, however, {{that the creation of}} single-seat constituencies would virtually eliminate the smaller opposition parties and would either create a United States-style two-party system or give the LDP an even greater majority in the lower house than it enjoyed under the multiple-seat system.|$|R

5000|$|In Russia, on {{par with}} many other former Soviet Union economies, the {{profession}} emerged {{in the first half}} of 1990, and represented a clean break with the former practice of industry-specific pricing specialists and with activities of statutory price-setting authorities in the Soviet Union. Currently, property valuation, as it is called, is a specialism within general-purpose [...] "valuation profession", which functions in a self-regulatory mode overseen by [...] "self-regulated professional organizations" [...] of valuers (SROs), i.e. public supervisory entities established under provisions of special legislation (which very loosely can be likened to trade unions). The principal among those is Russian Society of Appraisers, established in 1993 and presently exercising oversight over about half of the valuation profession membership. Among its 6000+ members a sizeable majority are real property valuers, rubbing shoulders with business and intangible assets appraisers. The latter categories of valuers are also allowed to value property, though valuation professionals tend to specialize. In late 2016, it was mandated that valuers should pass through compulsory state-administered attestation process to verify their competence, the details of which as to breakdown in specialization or otherwise remain to be hammered out. As of mid-2016, Valuers in Russia, including real property valuers, are deemed to be purposely-educated individuals maintaining their Valuation SRO membership and bearing unlimited property liability for the result of their services, that is their professional status is modeled on the organization of public notaries. Regardless of the fact, over 80% of valuers tend to be employed by valuation or consulting companies, and thus do not enter practice as stand-alone individual entrepreneurs. High-end appraisal services are principally represented by valuation arms of the International [...] "Big-four" [...] consultancies in the country, but there also exist reputable national corporate valuation brands.Most of valuations in the country tend to be performed for statutory purposes envisaged by the Federal Valuation Law (the latest amendment in 2016) and other related laws, such as the Joint Stock Companies Law. Such pieces of legislation provide for more than 20 so-called [...] "mandatory cases of valuation", including valuations for privatization purposes, lending purposes, bankruptcy and liquidation etc. Valuations for corporate accounts used to be much more prominent before 2000, when the national accounting regulator ceased to incentivize the accounting fair value option. At present, the mass appraisal of property for taxation purposes is also starting to be outsourced by the Government to the institution of professional valuers.Adjudication of valuer-certified estimates of value in case of the onset of disputes is conducted through the Experts Councils of valuers' SROs. Official courts tend to concur with the resolutions of such Councils. In some rare instances the imprimatur of SRO's Experts Councils is also required for a valuation done by a particular valuer to enter into effect.The technical details of practice of real estate valuers in Russia are aligned with the international pattern. Members of the Russian Society of Appraisers formerly were bound by the observance of the International Valuation Standards. There also exists a set of 14 general-purpose government-developed [...] "Federal Valuation Standards" [...] (FSOs 1,2,3 --are the general valuation standards fist adopted in 2007 (and revised 2015) and covering Terms of engagement and Valuation report content requirements, FSOs 7-11 are asset-specific standards adopted in 2015, while FSO 9 is currently the only purpose-specific standard in the set dealing with valuations of property for loan security purposes; the last two FSO standards adopted in 2016 cover determination of investment and liquidation values, however, they do not touch on the methodology for determining these values, only scraping the reporting requirements). In view of the international conformity drive in the latest round of FSO standards setting, general requirements im the new FSO standards are close to those in the International Valuation standards set, however they can be more specific on occasion and mandate <b>compulsory</b> <b>disclosure</b> of uncertainty in valuation reports using the interval/range format.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} whether or not conflict existed in residential sectional title schemes and if so the causes thereof. Residential sectional title properties, unlike conventional residential freehold properties, imposed co-ownership, co-management and expense sharing amongst owners in this type of development. This means that owners in this development are not just owners of sections that they purchased and exclusively occupied, but they were also jointly responsible for the administering, controlling and managing of the common property in the scheme in which they had become owners. This dissertation revealed that, despite their popularity, sectional title properties might be marked by conflict which can affect the smooth and efficient operation of this type of property ownership. Causes of conflict include violation of the scheme rules by owners or residents, trustees' failure and/or refusal to adhere to their bodies' corporate rules, conditions or restrictions, financial mismanagement or misappropriation by the trustees and managing agents, power struggle amongst individuals over the control of the body' corporate resources, lack or poor understanding, amongst owners and their trustees, of how this type of development works, and disrespect of the bodies corporate and its members by their managing agents. This study suggests <b>compulsory</b> information <b>disclosure</b> to prospective and current owners regarding the requirements and obligations of owners in this type of development. Further, that there should be regular and compulsory trainings for the trustees. Accordingly, the study suggests how conflict in multi-owned properties can be mitigated and ensured that the ownership of this type of property can be protected.

The theoretical research background is based on the underlying assumptions that sustain the Hypothesis of Political Costs of Watts and Zimmerman (1978) and the Agency Theory To conduct the research is used a sample of 34 non-financial companies of mixed capital of Parana State. As a proxy for income smoothing is used the metric of Eckel (1981) and two metrics of Leuz, Nanda and Wysocki (2003). To measure the <b>compulsory</b> <b>disclosure,</b> the research used a metric composed of 54 items as indicated in Law 6404 / 76. The main findings indicate that income smoothing and mandatory disclosure are not associated. It was expected that the results of income smoothing could influence positively and significantly at some levels of the mandatory disclosure. The results should be interpreted with caution given four reasons. First, the metrics for income smoothing are based on underlying assumptions that are not free from some specific errors or even measure problems. Second, the presence of income smoothing does not necessarily mean it is performed intentionally, meaning that they may simply result from changes in business operations. Third, due to the mandatory nature of information releases, the disclosure rates should be high. Finally, there is little research involving State-Owned Companies and its accounting practices, therefore there are many research opportunities on this field...|$|E

40|$|In this research, {{we examine}} a unique aspect of China’s {{regulatory}} regime, where earnings guidance disclosures {{are required for}} loss firms and firms with material net income increases/decreases (50 % or more). We find that Chinese firms are reluctant to provide earnings guidance disclosures voluntarily, especially bad news disclosures. Importantly, firms use earnings management (through discretionary accruals and nonrecurring items) to avoid the 50 % earnings decrease threshold and <b>compulsory</b> bad news <b>disclosure.</b> In addition, the finding shows that large firms and state-controlled firms {{are more likely to}} report net income decrease by 45 - 50 %, consistent with our expectation that managers of state-controlled firms are sensitive to large earnings decreases, which may more easily cause public attention and trigger regulatory investigations. The findings have important implications for policymakers: an earnings-based disclosure regulation does force some firms to disclose bad news in general, so that information asymmetry between investors and managers is reduced. However, other firms tend to use earnings management to avoid such a disclosure, and accounting earnings of those firms do not reflect underlying economic earnings...|$|R

40|$|Yermack (1997) 及Aboody and Kasznik (2000) 均發現，由於股票選擇權的執行價格會與當日股票市價一致，所以高階經理人會在股票選擇權獎酬日前釋出壞消息，以使股價下跌，並在股票選擇權獎酬日後立即釋出好消息，以使其內涵價值增加。另外，最近有關公司自願性揭露的實務有所變革。Wasley and Wu (2006) 指出，經理人現金流量預測的自願性揭露數目，自 2000 年代早期以來，迄今增加幅度超過三倍以上。當財務分析師預測公司將有盈餘虧損時，經理人較會自願揭露現金流量預測以調整分析師與投資人的預期。Kasznik and Lev (1995) 認為，經理人的盈餘預測很有可能傳遞壞消息，此意味著經理人關心訴訟風險，故先發制人的發佈盈餘預測來調整投資人期望的跌落。大體上，自願性揭露與強制性揭露的整體水準愈高，經理人愈不易利用操縱資訊揭露時點與從事盈餘管理，故不會由股票選擇權的執行價格與市價間的套利機會來獲得不當利潤；但當經理人持有較高比例的股票選擇權時，兩者的採用也可能使經理人更易操弄股價。Bartov and Mohanram (2004) 發現，高階經理人在履約大量股票選擇權前公司將有異常正盈餘，履約後則出現異常負盈餘，表示經理人知道未來盈餘不佳之私有資訊。如果經理人揭露資訊能有效增強公司的外部資金，則可預期自願性揭露與強制性揭露的整體水準愈高，經理人愈不易利用操縱資訊揭露時點與從事盈餘管理來獲得不當利潤。另Ittner, Lambert, and Larcker (2003) 指出，新經濟公司配股的主要目標係為留任新僱用員工，此因新創公司須要較多資金，故公司剛起步時較不願意將現金大量發放，而採用股票選擇權方式來獎勵有能力的員工。因此，本計畫在第一年的主要研究目的為：(1) 探討高階經理人現金流量預測公佈時點是否在股票選擇權授與日之後?經理人是否同時利用揭露現金流量預測及盈餘預測使其股票選擇權內涵價值提昇，進而獲取個人私利?(2) 探討揭露現金流量預測的公司是否為經營績效較佳或是有好消息的公司?公佈此項資訊的公司是否比未公佈的公司有更多有利的現金流量資訊? 新經濟公司或新創公司是否有藉由此項自願性揭露來發射好消息的訊號?(3) 探討公司揭露政策的整體水準是否影響公司的外部融資成本與成長性? 此水準是否為經理人用來操縱股價與盈餘管理的手段?另一方面，不論是學術界或實務界，如Bertrand and Mullainathan (2001) 、Bebchuk and Fried (2003) 與Rappaport (1999) ，均認為給付的大幅增加至少有一部分是屬於意外收穫，亦即經理人變得更加富有部分是牛市(指股價上漲時) 所引起的。代理理論認為，經理人的薪酬若按相對於標竿的績效來給付，將可消除市場或部門績效對公司整體績效的影響。但一些文章卻認為此種指標難以觀察，因為經理人可按個人利益來設定給付，亦即可選擇按運氣給付或按績效給付。Oyer(2004) 指出，標竿無法在獎酬中觀察，此因經理人的外界機會之價值是市場敏感的。這項理由可用來解釋為何當市場上漲時就沒有標竿，當市場情況不錯時，經理人外界機會也會提高，此時若公司為其訂定標竿，經理人將易離職。Himmelbergand Hubbard (2000) 及Oyer (2004) 皆認為：當經理人的保留薪資來自外界就業機會時，此制止經理人跳槽的保留薪資，將會隨著經濟繁榮而變動，這時沒有相對績效評估是較佳的。換句話說，雖然代理理論認為，公司應指標化經理人獎酬以消除市場寬度影響，亦即消除相對績效評估，但仍有文獻指出，當經濟繁榮時市場對具有才能的經理人之需求將提高，此時公司必然要順應市場潮流，支付給經理人更多獎酬以留住人才。因此，本計畫在第二年的主要研究目的為：(1) 驗證經理人的外界就業機會是否來自經理人的才能或公司的經營績效? 當其就業機會很高時，經理人獎酬是否隨著市場指標而改變? 此時經理人是否會放棄利用盈餘管理來操縱股價，其並不會期望利用股票選擇權的執行來獲利?(2) 經理人獎酬的大幅增加通常有部分來自意外收穫，亦即經理人變得更加富有部分是牛市引起的。因此，本研究擬驗證經理人運氣較佳或市場繁榮時，經理人獎酬是否將隨著市場指標而改變? 此時經理人是否放棄利用盈餘管理來操縱股價，而不需從股票選擇權的執行來獲利?(3) 驗證經理人運氣下降或績效下降時，經理人獎酬是否因而大量減少? 此時經理人是否有可能為了避免被更換，採用盈餘管理來操縱股價，並從股票選擇權的執行來增加財富?Yermack (1997) and Aboody and Kasznik (2000) {{find that}} because the {{exercise}} price ofstock option is set at the stock market price at award date, CEOs may delay favorableearnings announcements and rush announcing adverse information prior to the option awarddate {{in order to reduce}} stock price and increase intrinsic value of stock options. Wasley andWu (2006) indicate {{that there has been a}} dramatic increase in the issuance of managementcash flow forecasts, and the number of such forecasts has more than tripled since 2000. Ingeneral, executives have incentives to supply voluntary disclosures, such as cash flowforecasts, to signal good news about firm performance and bring about the needed adjustmentof investors』and analysts』expectations. Kasznik and Lev (1995) indicate that voluntaryexecutive earnings forecasts are likely to convey bad news. This implies executives areconcerned with the litigation risk and thus issue preemptive earnings forecasts to causeinvestors to adjust their expectations downward. In most cases, when a firm has a higheroverall level of disclosure, including both voluntary and <b>compulsory</b> <b>disclosures,</b> it is lesslikely for the executives to manipulate the timing of information release and perform earningsmanagement. However, executives have higher incentive to manipulate stock prices whenthey possess a large quantity of option awards. Bartov and Mohanram (2004) show that there are positive abnormal earnings before themanagers exercise stock options and negative abnormal earnings after they exercise stockoptions. The implication is that management owns private information regarding futureearnings and makes profit from this information asymmetry. If managerial disclosure caneffectively lower the cost of external fund, we can expect that the higher the overall level ofdisclosure is, the less incentive for the executives to make profit from timing the signalrelease and manipulating earnings. Moreover, Ittner, Lambert, and Larcker (2003) find thatthe goal of stock option awards is to retain new employees and reserve capital for futuregrowth for new economy firms. Hence, the main research purposes in the first year are:(1) To examine whether the CEO times the cash flow forecast after the stock option awarddates and whether the CEO discloses both cash flow forecasts and earnings forecasts toincrease the intrinsic values of stock options. (2) To examine whether the firms with cash flow forecast disclosures have more favorablecash flow news and better performance than the firm without disclosure, and whether neweconomy firms and young firms use more voluntary disclosure to signal good news. (3) To examine whether overall level of disclosure influences the external financing cost andgrowth of the firm, and whether managers make use of the disclosure policies to performearnings management and manipulate stock price. On the other hand, both academics and practitioners (for example, Bertrand andMullainathan,, 2001; Bebchuk and Fried, 2003; Rappaport, 1999) indicate that the largeincrease in pay is in part a windfall, resulting from a bull market. Bertrand and Mullainathan(2001) show that executive pay is sensitive to exogenous forces, for example, luck. Agencytheory indicates that executives should be paid based on a benchmark to remove the effects ofmarket. However, some studies suggest that it is difficult to have a benchmark. This isbecause executives can set compensation based on pay for luck or pay for performance,depending on whichever is favorable to them. Oyer (2004) suggest that benchmarking is notobserved in compensation because the outside opportunity values of CEOs are sensitive tomarket. The CEOs』market opportunities are up when the market is up, and they will quit ifthe firm attempts to benchmark them. Himmelberg and Hubbard (2000), and Oyer (2004) suggest that if CEOs』reservation pays are associated with outside employment opportunities;this reservation pay for preventing CEO quit will vary with economy states. In this case, it isoptimal if the firm does not have relative performance evaluation. In other words, althoughagency theory indicate that the firm should index executives compensation to removemarket-wide effects, that is, to remove relative performance evaluation, some studies supportthat the firm should pay more compensation to retain talented executives in the boom period. Hence, the research purposes of the second year are:(1) To examine whether CEOs』outside employment opportunities are associated with theirtalent and firm performance and whether CEO compensation varies with market indexwhen the opportunities are high? In this case, whether CEOs forgo employing earningsmanagement to manipulate stock price and do not try to serve self-interest whenexercising stock option. (2) In general, when there is a large increase in CEO compensation, a part of thecompensation increase arises from windfall, that is, the CEO is riding a bull market. Therefore, this research will examine whether CEO compensation varies with the marketindex. In this case, whether the CEOs do not employ earnings management to influencestock price when they exercise stock option. (3) To examine whether CEO compensations will significantly decrease when the CEO』s luckand/or talent is down. Under this case, whether CEO employs earnings management toavoid being replaced, and to increase wealth through exercising stock option awards...|$|R
40|$|Following Pillar 3 {{of the new}} Basel Capital Adequacy Proposals (Basel II), we analyse {{the effects}} of {{disclosure}} in the banking sector in a stylised setting of delegated portfolio management. We first consider {{the interaction between the}} shareholder and the manager of a bank - the manager has to exert risk monitoring effort in order to decrease the bank's probability of default. Disclosure is captured through a signal about the manager's effort and it is shown that the shareholder desires full disclosure (a perfect signal) so as to implement the first best level of effort. We then introduce a third stakeholder that has fixed claims on the bank, the debt-holder. This agent introduces a counteracting effect: the shareholder may not desire full disclosure anymore given that a lower level of disclosure allows the bank to improve its perceived probability of default, which in turn decreases its financing costs. This implies that subordinated debt itself may not increase the soundness of the banking sector unless it is accompanied by measures of <b>compulsory</b> <b>disclosure...</b>|$|E
