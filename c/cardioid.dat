5|$|To keep low {{frequency}} sound {{focused on the}} audience area {{and not on the}} stage, and to keep low frequencies from bothering people outside of the event space, a variety of techniques have been developed in concert sound to turn the naturally omnidirectional radiation of subwoofers into a more directional pattern. Several examples of sound reinforcement system applications where sound engineers seek to provide more directional bass sound are music festivals, which often have several bands performing at the same time on different stages; large raves or EDM events, where there are multiple DJs performing {{at the same time in}} different rooms or stages; and multiplex movie theatres, in which there are many films being shown simultaneously in auditoriums that share common walls. These techniques include setting up subwoofers in a vertical array; using combinations of delay and polarity inversion; and setting up a delay-shaded system. With a <b>cardioid</b> dispersion pattern, two end-fire subwoofers can be placed one in front of the other. The enclosure nearest the listener is delayed by a few milliseconds The second subwoofer is delayed a precise amount corresponding to the time it takes sound to traverse the distance between speaker grilles.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{engineer}} cardiac tissue in vitro {{is limited by}} the absence of a vasculature. In this study we describe an in vivo model which allows neovascularization of engineered cardiac tissue. Three-dimensional cardiac tissue, termed “cardioids,” was engineered in vitro from the spontaneous delamination of a confluent monolayer of cardiac cells. <b>Cardioids</b> were sutured onto a support framework and then implanted in a subcutaneous pocket in syngeneic recipient rats. Three weeks after implantation, <b>cardioids</b> were recovered for in vitro force testing and histological evaluation. Staining for hematoxylin and eosin demonstrated the presence of viable cells within explanted <b>cardioids.</b> Immunostaining with von Willebrand factor showed the presence of vascularization. Electron micrographs revealed the presence of large amounts of aligned contractile proteins and a high degree of intercellular connectivity. The peak active force increased from an average value of 57 [*]µN for control <b>cardioids</b> to 447 [*]µN for explanted <b>cardioids.</b> There was also {{a significant increase in the}} specific force. There was a significant decrease in the time to peak tension and half relaxation time. Explanted <b>cardioids</b> could be electrically paced at frequencies of 1 – 5 [*]Hz. Explanted <b>cardioids</b> exhibited a sigmoidal response to calcium and positive chronotropy in response to epinephrine. As the field of cardiac tissue engineering progresses, it becomes desirable to engineer larger diameter tissue equivalents and to induce angiogenesis within tissue constructs. This study describes a relatively simple in vivo model, which promotes the neovascularization of tissue-engineered heart muscle and subsequent improvement in contractile performance. ...|$|R

The sense antenna's output is mixed with the loop it is in-line with, through a switch that allows it to be turned on or off. When switched on, it produces a voltage that suppresses the output of the rear section of the loop, re-enforcing the forward section.

25|$|The {{operating}} principle of CCC equipment requires a column consisting {{of an open}} tube coiled around a bobbin. The bobbin is rotated in a double-axis gyratory motion (a <b>cardioid),</b> which causes a variable gravity (G) field {{to act on the}} column during each rotation. This motion causes the column to see one partitioning step per revolution and components of the sample separate in the column due to their partitioning coefficient between the two immiscible liquid phases used. There are many types of CCC available today. These include HSCCC (High Speed CCC) and HPCCC (High Performance CCC).

25|$|Vactrols {{have been}} used as {{remote-controlled}} resistors for precise ground termination of Beverage and Ewe type antennae. In a typical ham radio setup, the vactrol is placed in the termination box at the farthest point of the antenna. The LDR modifies total resistance between antenna and ground (termination resistance); the operator fine-tunes this resistor from his radio shack by varying the vactrol's LED or bulb current with a potentiometer. Tuning with vactrols improves directional <b>cardioid</b> pattern of the antenna. According to Connelly, vactrols are superior to traditional resistors in this function. In this simple layout, the LED or bulb of the vactrol is prone to damage by voltage surges induced by lightning, and must be protected by a pair of neon lamps acting as gas dischargers.|$|E

25|$|Condenser {{microphones}} {{span the}} range from telephone transmitters through inexpensive karaoke microphones to high-fidelity recording microphones. They generally produce a high-quality audio signal {{and are now}} the popular choice in laboratory and recording studio applications. The inherent suitability of this technology {{is due to the}} very small mass that must be moved by the incident sound wave, unlike other microphone types that require the sound wave to do more work. They require a power source, provided either via microphone inputs on equipment as phantom power or from a small battery. Power is necessary for establishing the capacitor plate voltage, and is also needed to power the microphone electronics (impedance conversion in the case of electret and DC-polarized microphones, demodulation or detection in the case of RF/HF microphones). Condenser microphones are also available with two diaphragms that can be electrically connected to provide a range of polar patterns (see below), such as <b>cardioid,</b> omnidirectional, and figure-eight. It is also possible to vary the pattern continuously with some microphones, for example the Røde NT2000 or CAD M179.|$|E
25|$|The inner {{elements}} of a microphone are {{the primary source of}} differences in directivity. A pressure microphone uses a diaphragm between a fixed internal volume of air and the environment, and responds uniformly to pressure from all directions, so it is said to be omnidirectional. A pressure-gradient microphone uses a diaphragm that is at least partially open on both sides. The pressure difference between the two sides produces its directional characteristics. Other elements such as the external shape of the microphone and external devices such as interference tubes can also alter a microphone's directional response. A pure pressure-gradient microphone is equally sensitive to sounds arriving from front or back, but insensitive to sounds arriving from the side because sound arriving at the front and back at the same time creates no gradient between the two. The characteristic directional pattern of a pure pressure-gradient microphone is like a figure-8. Other polar patterns are derived by creating a capsule that combines these two effects in different ways. The <b>cardioid,</b> for instance, features a partially closed backside, so its response is a combination of pressure and pressure-gradient characteristics.|$|E
500|$|Another <b>cardioid</b> {{subwoofer}} array pattern {{can be used}} horizontally, {{one which}} takes few channels of processing and no change in required physical space. This method is often called [...] "cardioid subwoofer array" [...] or [...] "CSA" [...] even though the pattern of all directional subwoofer methods is <b>cardioid.</b> The CSA method reverses the enclosure orientation and inverts the polarity of {{one out of every}} three subwoofers across the front of the stage, and delays those enclosures for maximum cancellation of the target frequency on stage. Polarity inversion can be implemented electronically, by reversing the wiring polarity, or by physically positioning the enclosure to face rearward. This method reduces forward output relative to a tight-packed, flat-fronted array of subwoofers, but can solve problems of unwanted low frequency energy coming into microphones on stage. Compared to the end-fire array, this method has less on-axis energy but more even pattern control throughout the audience, and more predictable cancellation rearward. The effect spans a range of slightly more than one octave.|$|E

In /hep-th/ 9501235 a systematic algebro-geometric approach was developed to the study of generic Mandelbrot sets, but emergency of nearly ideal circles in the special case of the family x^ 2 +c was not fully explained. In the present paper the shape of the elementary constituents of Mandelbrot Set is explicitly calculated, and difference between the shapes of root and descendant domains (<b>cardioids</b> and circles respectively) is explained. Such qualitative difference persists for all other Mandelbrot sets: descendant domains always have one less cusp than the root ones. Details of the phase transition between different Mandelbrot sets are explicitly demonstrated, including overlaps between elementary domains and dynamics of attraction/repulsion regions. Explicit examples of 3 -dimensional sections of Universal Mandelbrot Set are given. Also a systematic small-size approximation is developed for evaluation of various Feigenbaum indices.

Noether's theorem reveals that these same symmetries furnish generalized forms of the first integrals in a special nonconservative case, which approximates various physical models. The system is perturbed by a biparametric acceleration with components along the tangential and normal directions. A similarity transformation reduces the biparametric disturbance to a simpler uniparametric forcing along the velocity vector. The solvability conditions of this new problem are discussed, and closed-form solutions for the integrable cases are provided. Thanks to the conservation of a generalized energy, the orbits are classified as elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic. Keplerian orbits appear naturally as particular solutions to the problem. After characterizing the orbits independently, a unified form of the solution {{is built based on}} the Weierstrass elliptic functions.

40|$|Consider {{the problem}} of {{sampling}} signals that are nonbandlimited but have finite number of degrees of freedom per unit of time and call this number the rate of innovation. Streams of Diracs and piecewise polynomials are the examples of such signals, and thus are known as signals with finite rate of innovation (FRI) [3]. We know that the classical (‘bandlimited-sinc’) sampling theory does not enable perfect reconstruction of such signals from their samples since they are not bandlimited. However, the recent results on FRI sampling [3], [4] {{suggest that it is}} possible to sample and perfectly reconstruct such nonbandlimited signals using a rich class of kernels. In this paper, we extend the results of [4] in higher dimensions using compactly supported kernels that reproduce polynomials (satisfy Strang-Fix conditions). In fact, the polynomial reproduction property of the kernel makes it possible to obtain the continuous-moments of the signal from its samples. Using these moments and the annihilating filter method (Prony’s method), the innovative part of the signal, and therefore, the signal itself is perfectly reconstructed.

Targets were composed of dots configured as outline drawings of circles, ellipses, <b>cardioids,</b> wiggly lines, or amorphous blobs. In some cases, dot spacing was varied, extraneous dot clusters were superimposed, or different distributions of dots inside the boundary were added.

When the target was a cluster of quasi-random dots, saccades landed closer to the center-of-area of the implied surface than to the average location of the dots. Overall, the positions of individual dots were important only insofar as the dots affected overall target shape.
