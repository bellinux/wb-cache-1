5|$|On 26 May 2011 American writer Jeffery Deaver, {{commissioned}} by Ian Fleming Publications, released <b>Carte</b> <b>Blanche.</b> Deaver restarted the chronology of Bond, {{separate from the}} timelines {{of any of the}} previous authors, by stating he was born in 1980; the novel also saw Bond in a post-9/11 agency, independent of either MI5 or MI6.|$|E
5|$|The novel sold nearly 9,000 {{copies in}} its first week, {{although}} that was 48% down on Jeffrey Deaver's 2011 novel <b>Carte</b> <b>Blanche,</b> and even further behind Sebastian Faulks's 2008 book Devil May Care. By 10 October the London Evening Standard listed the books as {{number one on the}} London's Bestsellers list, and in the two weeks of 5 and 12 October 2013 was shown as number 3 in the UK fiction best sellers list, dropping to fourth place on 19 October 2013.|$|E
5|$|For the post-Fleming {{continuation}} Bond authors, Leiter {{has also}} {{appeared on a}} periodic basis. After John Gardner took over writing the James Bond novel series, Leiter made an occasional appearance and the novel For Special Services introduces his daughter, Cedar Leiter, {{who is also a}} CIA officer (and briefly Bond's romantic conquest). Raymond Benson also included Leiter's character in some of his novels, including The Facts of Death and Doubleshot. Similarly the more recent continuation Bond novels—the 2008 Sebastian Faulks novel Devil May Care and the 2011 novel <b>Carte</b> <b>Blanche</b> by Jeffery Deaver—both contained the character.|$|E
5|$|The American writer Jeffery Deaver {{was then}} {{commissioned}} by Ian Fleming Publications to produce <b>Carte</b> <b>Blanche,</b> {{which was published}} on 26 May 2011. The book updated Bond working for a post-9/11 agency, independent of MI5 or MI6. On 26 September 2013 the novel Solo, by William Boyd {{was published in the}} UK and by HarperCollins in Canada and the US; the book was once again set in the 1960s. In October 2014 it was announced that Anthony Horowitz was to write a further Bond instalment. The novel, titled Trigger Mortis, is set in the 1950s, and it contains material written, but previously unreleased, by Fleming.|$|E
5|$|After a gap of six years, Sebastian Faulks was {{commissioned}} by Ian Fleming Publications to write a new Bond novel, which was released on 28 May 2008, the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth. The book—titled Devil May Care—was published in the UK by Penguin Books and by Doubleday in the US. American writer Jeffery Deaver was then commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to produce <b>Carte</b> <b>Blanche,</b> which was published on 26 May 2011. The book updated Bond into a post-9/11 agent, independent of MI5 or MI6. On 26 September 2013 Solo, written by William Boyd, was published, set in 1969. In October 2014 {{it was announced that}} Anthony Horowitz was to write a Bond continuation novel. Set in the 1950s two weeks after the events of Goldfinger, it contains material written, but previously unreleased, by Fleming. Trigger Mortis was released on 8 September 2015.|$|E
5|$|The studio had wasted $5 {{million and}} a year's worth of time with Abel and Associates, {{although}} Abel reportedly gained a new production studio filled with equipment using Paramount's money. Trumbull, meanwhile, had completed Close Encounters but his plan for a full feature had been cancelled by Paramount, a move some considered punishment for passing on Star Trek. With Trumbull now available, primary responsibility for The Motion Pictures optical effects passed on to him. In March the studio offered Trumbull virtual <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> {{if he could get}} the opticals work completed by December, the release date to which Paramount was financially committed (having accepted advances from exhibitors planning on a Christmas delivery). Trumbull was confident that he could get the work done without a loss of quality despite a reputation for missing deadlines because of his perfectionism. Paramount assigned a studio executive to Trumbull to make sure he would meet the release date, and together with Yuricich the effects team rushed to finish. The effects budget climbed to $10million.|$|E
5|$|In {{the video}} game Halo 2 (2004), {{a member of the}} Covenant Prophet triumvirate, Regret, arrives at Earth with a fleet. Most of his fleet is destroyed; Regret's ship flees to another ring, Delta Halo, and is {{followed}} by the human ship In Amber Clad and the Master Chief aboard her. The Chief kills Regret before the majority of the Covenant fleet arrives at Delta Halo, along with the Covenant's holy city of High Charity. The death of Regret leads the remaining Prophets to promote the Brutes as their guards, replacing the Elites. The Elites, outraged, threaten to resign from the Covenant high council; in turn the Prophets give the Brutes <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> to kill the Elites, sparking a civil war. In the midst of these developments, the Flood are again released; the High Prophet Mercy is killed by the parasite, while the last remaining leader, Truth, flees to Earth in a Forerunner ship, entrusting the activation of Halo to the Brute Tartarus. The Elites ally with the humans of In Amber Clad to stop the firing of the ring, but inadvertently set all the remaining Halo rings to be remotely activated from a location known as the Ark, placed outside the range of the Halo Array to protect certain species from the firing of the Halo rings, built as a foundry for the rings including replacing any that get destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The {{television}} show <b>Carte</b> <b>Blanche</b> dedicated an investigation {{to a number}} of these allegations.|$|E
25|$|Following a vast socio-economical {{collapse}} and {{a period of}} martial law, the United States government has {{had to rely on}} several megacorporations to survive. This has given them a veritable <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> to operate as they will.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, on August 1, 1815 {{the owner}} DeForest, had applied <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> {{to operate with}} General Belgrano, the Tucumán, Criollo from Buenos Aires and Potosi, Bolivia. On August 31, the {{government}} granted a patent that on September 30 was extended to the Congress in Buenos Aires to replace Belgrano.|$|E
25|$|In {{light of}} the controversy, Allan {{was the subject of}} a 1988 SABC {{documentary}} produced by Pieter Cilliers. Allan discussed her life and addressed the affair allegations in an interview with <b>Carte</b> <b>Blanche</b> co-presenter, Ruda Landman. Allan's colleagues such as the film critic Barry Ronge were also interviewed to discuss their experience of working with Allan.|$|E
25|$|Sinologists Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals {{estimate}} that between 750,000 and 1.5 {{million people were}} killed in the violence of the Cultural Revolution, in rural China alone. Mao's Red Guards were given <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> to abuse and kill the revolution's enemies. For example, in August 1966, over 100 teachers were murdered by their students in western Beijing alone.|$|E
25|$|On October 18, Almeida {{headed a}} {{consortium}} of investors from Baltimore, represented by Stevenson & Goowdin, and he purchased the ship at auction to continue the privateering voyage alone. According to the request, on November 7 the government issued him a <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> on bond No. 67, financed by Juan Pedro de Aguirre, who also owned 20%.|$|E
25|$|After this victory, Böhme was {{transferred}} to Jasta 2 {{under the command of}} Oswald Boelcke. Boelcke was not only a well-established ace, but was pioneering the tactics and strategy of fighter aviation. He had <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> to recruit such pilots as he wished. He had asked for, among others, both Manfred von Richthofen and Böhme. Boelcke and Böhme became best friends.|$|E
25|$|The {{important}} French watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet {{became a}} great friend of Arnold. In 1792, the Duke of Orleans met Arnold in London and showed him one of Breguet's clocks. Arnold was so impressed that he immediately travelled to Paris and sought permission for Breguet to take on his son as his apprentice. Arnold appears to have given Breguet <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> to incorporate or develop any of Arnold's inventions and techniques into his own watches.|$|E
25|$|Sudbury is {{also home}} to the Science North Production Team, an award-winning {{producer}} of documentary films and multimedia presentations for museums. Independent filmmaker B. P. Paquette and producer Jason Ross Jallet are based in Sudbury. Inner City Films, a production company owned by Sudbury native Robert Adetuyi, also has a production office in the city, as does <b>Carte</b> <b>Blanche</b> Films, the producer of Météo+, Les Blues de Ramville and Hard Rock Medical.|$|E
25|$|There was {{the usual}} panic at Westminster, but, {{unfortunately}} for Charles, it resulted in Fairfax being directed to abandon the siege of Oxford and given <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> to bring the Royal army to battle wherever it was met. On his side the King had, after the capture of Leicester, accepted the advice of those who feared {{for the safety of}} Oxford. Rupert, though commander-in-chief, was unable to insist on the northern enterprise and had marched to Daventry, where he halted to throw supplies into Oxford.|$|E
25|$|The 1,500-seat Grieg Hall is the city's main {{cultural}} venue, {{and home}} of the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra, founded in 1765, and the Bergen Woodwind Quintet. The city also features <b>Carte</b> <b>Blanche,</b> the Norwegian national company of contemporary dance. The annual Bergen International Festival is the main cultural festival, which is supplemented by the Bergen International Film Festival. Two internationally renowned composers from Bergen are Edvard Grieg and Ole Bull. Grieg's home, Troldhaugen, has been converted to a museum. During the 1990s and early 2000s, Bergen produced a series of successful pop, rock and black metal artists, collectively known as the Bergen Wave.|$|E
25|$|Bogdanovich {{followed}} up The Last Picture Show {{with the popular}} comedy What's Up, Doc? (1972), starring Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neal, a screwball comedy indebted to Hawks's Bringing Up Baby (1938) and His Girl Friday (1940). Despite his reliance on homage to bygone cinema, Bogdanovich solidified his status {{as one of a}} new breed of A-list directors that included Academy Award winners Francis Ford Coppola and William Friedkin, with whom he formed The Directors Company. The Directors Company was a generous production deal with Paramount Pictures that essentially gave the directors <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> if they kept within budget limitations. It was through this entity that Bogdanovich's Paper Moon (1973) was produced.|$|E
25|$|On 19 February 1937, two Eritreans made {{a failed}} {{assassination}} attempt on Rodolfo Graziani, the Viceroy of Italian East Africa and appointed Governor-General of Shewa during the Italian occupation of Ethiopia. In return, under <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> {{permission from the}} Federal Secretary Guido Cortese, many Italian civilians, members of the military, and the paramilitary forces known as the Blackshirts conducted a three-day bloody reprisal in Addis Ababa. Known in Ethiopia as the Yekatit 12 massacre, it resulted {{in the killing of}} thousands of people and arrests of many Amhara aristocratic noblemen, about 400 of whom were subsequently deported to Rome, Longobucco, Mercogliano, Ponza, Tivoli, and Asinara, Italy.|$|E
25|$|Because NBC did {{not want}} to lose Paar to another network, it offered him a Friday prime-time hour, giving him <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> on content and format. He agreed, {{deciding}} on a variation of his late-night format and titling the show The Jack Paar Program. The show, which debuted in the fall of 1962, had a world view, debuting acts from around the globe and showing films from exotic locations. Most of the films included in it were made on travels by guests such as Arthur Godfrey or Paar himself (e.g., several visits with Albert Schweitzer at his compound in Gabon in Central Africa, and Mary Martin at her home in the jungles of Brazil).|$|E
25|$|During Nehru's {{second term}} as general {{secretary}} of the Congress, he proposed certain resolutions concerning the foreign policy of India. From that time onward, he was given <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> in framing the foreign policy of any future Indian nation. He developed good relations with governments all over the world. He firmly placed India on the side of democracy and freedom during a time when the world was under the threat of fascism. He was also given the responsibility of planning the economy of a future India. He appointed the National Planning Commission in 1938 to help in framing such policies. However, many of the plans framed by Nehru and his colleagues would come undone with the unexpected partition of India in 1947.|$|E
25|$|On {{the west}} side of Main Campus are three red brick {{buildings}} that were original to Armour Institute, built between 1891 and 1901. In 1938, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe began his 20-year tenure as director of IIT's School of Architecture (1938–1959). The university {{was on the verge of}} building a brand new campus, to be one of the nation's first federally funded urban renewal projects. Mies was given <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> in the large commission, and the university grew fast enough during and after World War II to allow much of the new plan to be realized. From 1943 to 1957, several new Mies buildings rose across campus, including the S.R. Crown Hall, which houses the architecture school, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2001.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the 1918 strike, Sir Edward Henry, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police resigned and was replaced by a serving soldier, General Sir Nevil Macready. Macready immediately began reorganising the command structure of the police. As far as Macready was concerned the days of the NUPPO were numbered. He had the comforting knowledge that, given the circumstances in which his appointment was made, he was to have <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> in his dealings with the NUPPO and its officials. Macready did nothing to encourage talks with the union. He refused to recognise both James Marston, the president of NUPPO, and Jack Hayes, the general secretary. As far as Macready was concerned the police had had a grievance that was now settled, and NUPPO remained an unofficial body therefore they were not to be dealt with.|$|E
25|$|In June 1987, Lyon {{was bought}} by Rhône {{businessman}} Jean-Michel Aulas who {{took control of the}} club aiming to turn Lyon into an established Ligue 1 side. His ambitious plan, titled OL – Europe, was designed to develop the club at the European level and back into the first division within a period of no more than four years. The first manager under the new hierarchy was Raymond Domenech. The aspiring chairman gave Domenech <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> to recruit whoever he saw fit to help the team reach the first division. They went on to accomplish this in Domenech's first season in charge. Lyon achieved its zenith under Domenech when it qualified for the UEFA Cup. For the remainder of his tenure, however, the club underachieved. Domenech was replaced by former French international Jean Tigana, who led the team to an impressive second place in the 1994–95 season.|$|E
25|$|General Morgan and his 2,460 handpicked Confederate cavalrymen, {{along with}} 4 {{artillery}} pieces, departed from Sparta, Tennessee, on June 11, 1863, intending {{to divert the}} attention of the Union Army of the Ohio from Southern forces in the state and possibly stir up pro-southern sentiments in the North. Gen. Braxton Bragg, the regional Confederate commander, had intended for Morgan's cavalrymen to provide a distraction by entering Kentucky. Morgan, however, confided to some of his officers that he had long desired to invade Indiana and Ohio to bring the terror of war to the North. Bragg had given him <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> to ride throughout Tennessee and Kentucky, but ordered him to under no circumstances cross the Ohio River. On June 23, the Federal Army of the Cumberland began its operations against General Bragg's Confederate Army of Tennessee in {{what became known as the}} Tullahoma Campaign, and Morgan decided it was time to move northward into Kentucky.|$|E
25|$|When Cándido Nocedal died in 1885 Cerralbo {{was widely}} rumored to succeed him, but Carlos VII decided {{to lead the}} {{movement}} personally. Quoting health reasons Cerralbo for some time distanced himself from Carlist politics, marked by further conflict between Ramón Nocedal and the pretender. By virtue of his grandeza he entered the Senate in 1885, {{where he was the}} only Carlist. In 1886 Cerralbo headed a makeshift Junta co-coordinating the Carlist electoral effort, though structures of the movement were increasingly paralyzed by conflict until the Nocedalistas were expelled in 1888. The same year Carlos VII decided to counter their El Siglo Futuro by ordering de Cerralbo to create the official Carlist daily , which commenced his lifelong friendship with Juan Vázquez de Mella. De Cerralbo engaged in many other Carlist cultural initiatives. As royal representative he travelled across Spain in 1889-1890, a novelty in terms of mass mobilization; during some of these visits he was assaulted by the Republicans. Eventually, following other royal favors, in 1890 Cerralbo was nominated Jefe Delegado, receiving the claimant’s political <b>carte</b> <b>blanche.</b>|$|E
25|$|On December 31, Bonifacio and the Magdalo and Magdiwang leaders held {{a meeting}} in Imus, ostensibly to {{determine}} the leadership of Cavite in order to end the rivalry between the two factions. The issue of whether the Katipunan should {{be replaced by a}} revolutionary government was brought up by the Magdalo, and this eclipsed the rivalry issue. The Magdalo argued that the Katipunan, as a secret society, should have ceased to exist once the Revolution was underway. They also held that Cavite should not be divided. Bonifacio and the Magdiwang contended that the Katipunan served as their revolutionary government since it had its own constitution, laws, and provincial and municipal governments. Edilberto Evangelista presented a draft constitution for the proposed government to Bonifacio but he rejected it as it was too similar to the Spanish Maura Law. Upon the event of restructuring, Bonifacio was given <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> to appoint a committee tasked with setting up a new government; he would also be in charge of this committee. He tasked Emilio Aguinaldo to record the minutes of the meeting and requested for it to establish this authority, but these were never done and never provided.|$|E
500|$|In August 2011 the Serbian {{newspaper}} Blic {{stated that}} Bond 23 would be entitled <b>Carte</b> <b>Blanche</b> {{and would be}} an adaptation of the recent continuation novel by Jeffery Deaver. On 30 August Eon Productions officially denied any link between Bond 23 and <b>Carte</b> <b>Blanche,</b> stating that [...] "the new film {{is not going to}} be called <b>Carte</b> <b>Blanche</b> and will have nothing to do with the Jeffery Deaver book". On 3 October 2011 15 domain names including 'jamesbond-skyfall.com' and 'skyfallthefilm.com' were reported to have been registered on behalf of MGM and Sony Pictures by Internet brand-protection service MarkMonitor. This led to supposition in the media that the film had been given the name [...] "Skyfall". These reports were not confirmed at the time by Eon Productions, Sony or MGM. Skyfall was later confirmed as the title at a press conference on 3 November 2011, during which co-producer Barbara Broccoli said that the title [...] "has some emotional context which will be revealed in the film". The title refers to the name of Bond's childhood home [...] "Skyfall", and the setting for the film's finale.|$|E
500|$|On 31 March 2012 Boyd {{announced}} at the Oxford Literary Festival that {{he was working on}} a novel set in Africa. Boyd had lived in Nigeria—"where his mother was a teacher and his father a doctor"—during the Nigerian Civil War, which [...] "had a profound effect on him." [...] On 11 April 2012 the Fleming estate announced that Boyd would write a Bond novel to follow Jeffery Deaver's 2011 novel <b>Carte</b> <b>Blanche.</b> The civil war, over the attempted secession by Biafra from Nigeria, was the location for Solo, although Boyd renamed this as the fictional Zanzarim.|$|E
500|$|Boydell's {{relationships}} with his illustrators were generally congenial. One of them, James Northcote, praised Boydell's liberal payments. He {{wrote in an}} 1821 letter that Boydell [...] "did more {{for the advancement of}} the arts in England than the whole mass of the nobility put together! [...] He paid me more nobly than any other person has done; and his memory I shall ever hold in reverence". Boydell typically paid the painters between £105 to £210, and the engravers between £262 and £315. Joshua Reynolds at first declined Boydell's offer to work on the project, but he agreed when pressed. [...] Boydell offered Reynolds <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> for his paintings, giving him a down payment of £500, an extraordinary amount for an artist who had not even agreed to do a specific work. [...] Boydell eventually paid him a total of £1,500.|$|E
500|$|Wellington {{was also}} acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The Duke of York imposed {{many of his}} staff {{officers}} on Wellington, including his second-in-command the Earl of Uxbridge. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at Halle, [...] away to the west. They were not recalled {{to participate in the}} battle but were to serve as a fallback position should the battle be lost. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under Prince of Orange's younger brother Prince Frederick of the Netherlands. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.|$|E
500|$|In {{the body}} of the Autobiography, Wideman writes, Haley's authorial agency is {{seemingly}} absent: [...] "Haley does so much with so little fuss ... an approach that appears so rudimentary in fact conceals sophisticated choices, quiet mastery of a medium". Wideman argues that Haley wrote {{the body of}} the Autobiography in a manner of MalcolmX's choosing and the epilogue {{as an extension of the}} biography itself, his subject having given him <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> for the chapter. Haley's voice in {{the body of the}} book is a tactic, Wideman writes, producing a text nominally written by MalcolmX but seemingly written by no author. The subsumption of Haley's own voice in the narrative allows the reader to feel as though the voice of MalcolmX is speaking directly and continuously, a stylistic tactic that, in Wideman's view, was a matter of Haley's authorial choice: [...] "Haley grants Malcolm the tyrannical authority of an author, a disembodied speaker whose implied presence blends into the reader's imagining of the tale being told." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the speech's poor reception, Pitt effectively promised Cornwallis <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> to build support for union. [...] Portland wrote to Cornwallis, [...] "I hope it is unnecessary to assure your excellency that whatever your decisions may be you may depend upon their receiving the unreserved sanction and support of His Majesty's servants." [...] On the basis of these assurances, Cornwallis and Castlereagh developed a plan to coopt or convince enough of the propertied interests that controlled the parliament to support the union. [...] Cornwallis found this task, which occupied much of the next year, to be extremely distasteful: [...] "My occupation is now of the most unpleasant nature, negotiating and jobbing with the most corrupt people under heaven. [...] I despise and hate myself every hour for engaging in such dirty work, and am supported only by the reflection that without an Union the British Empire must be dissolved." [...] The task was made somewhat more pleasant by the arrival of his son for a short visit in July 1799.|$|E
500|$|The two {{original}} songs sung by New Directions {{were rated}} from excellent to abysmal. Benigno gave each song a [...] "B+"; {{he called the}} duet, [...] "Pretending", [...] "lovely". The nicest thing Kubicek wrote {{of it was that}} it sounded as if the lyrics had been [...] "written by a lovesick teenage boy", and he called [...] "Light Up the World" [...] a [...] "trainwreck". Berk was even harsher: [...] "When the show has <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> access to every amazing song in the history of popular music, there's something terribly humiliating about watching the kids sing this shit tune as their finale, and do so with such desperate conviction." [...] Gonzalez gave [...] "Light Up the World" [...] a [...] "B+", but said it sounded a [...] "bit too much" [...] like [...] "Loser Like Me", and while Benigno thought it had a better melody than [...] "Loser" [...] and also made [...] "much better use of the Gleeks as a whole", he criticized the chorus for its similarity to [...] "Let It Rock" [...] by Kevin Rudolf. Semigran said it was an [...] "uplifting, if not rather lackluster pop song", yet Hankinson called it his favorite number in the episode.|$|E
500|$|The Arbiter's first {{mission is}} to silence a renegade Elite who has been preaching that the Prophets have lied to the Covenant. The Arbiter is then sent to {{retrieve}} the [...] "Sacred Icon" [...] from the library on the newly discovered Delta Halo, in order to activate the ring and bring about the Great Journey, the Covenant's concept of salvation. Though he retrieves the Icon, the Arbiter is betrayed by the Chieftain of the Brutes, Tartarus; Tartarus reveals that the Prophets have given him and his race <b>carte</b> <b>blanche</b> to massacre the Elites and replace them in the Covenant caste system. Though the Arbiter is believed dead, he is rescued—along with his nemesis, the human soldier Master Chief—by the parasitic Flood intelligence Gravemind. Gravemind reveals that the Great Journey actually spells doom for all sentient life, and sends him to stop Tartarus from activating the ring. In the process of stopping the Brute, the Arbiter and his Elites forge an alliance with the humans Miranda Keyes and Avery Johnson, and the Arbiter slays Tartarus with help from Johnson, halting the firing of the ring. The unexpected shutdown of Halo triggers a standby sequence, which the Arbiter learns has made all the Halo installations ready to fire remotely from a place known as the Ark.|$|E
