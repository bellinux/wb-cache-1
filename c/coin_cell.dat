30|$|The {{electrochemical}} properties {{were assessed}} with CR 2032 <b>coin</b> <b>cells,</b> and the cells {{consisted of the}} LiCrxNi 0.5 − 0.5 xMn 1.5 − 0.5 xO 3.95 F 0.05 electrode as the cathode electrode, Li metal foil as the anode electrode, American Celgard 2400 as the separator and 1  mol/L LiPF 6 in EC/EMC/DMC (1 : 1 : 1 in volume) as the electrolyte. The cathode was synthesized by mixing the active material, carbon black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) at a weight ratio of 8 : 1 : 1 in the N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP) to form a homogeneous slurry, which was then coated on Al foil by a doctor blade coater and subsequently dried in a vacuum oven at 120  °C for 24  h to remove NMP and residual water.

40|$|Nowadays, {{rechargeable}} Li-ion batteries play {{an important}} role in portable consumer devices. Formulation of such batteries is improvable by researching new cathodic materials that present higher performances of cyclability and negligible efficiency loss over cycles. Goal of this work was to investigate a new cathodic material, copper nitroprusside, which presents a porous 3 D framework. Synthesis was carried out by a low-cost and scalable co-precipitation method. Subsequently, the product was characterized by means of different techniques, such as TGA, XRF, CHN elemental analysis, XRD, Mössbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.

50|$|The HP 95LX had an NEC V20 CPU (an Intel 8088 clone {{running at}} 5.37 MHz) with an Intel Corporation System on a chip (SoC) device. It cannot be {{considered}} completely PC-compatible {{because of its}} quarter-CGA (MDA) resolution LCD screen. It ran Microsoft's MS-DOS version 3.22 and had a customized version of Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.2 built in. Other software in read-only memory (ROM) included a calculator, an appointment calendar, a telecommunications program, and a simple text editor. It also included a CR 2032 lithium <b>coin</b> <b>cell</b> for memory backup when the two AA main batteries run out. For mass storage, the HP 95LX had a single PCMCIA slot which could hold a static RAM card (which had its own CR 2025 back-up <b>coin</b> <b>cell).</b> An RS-232-compatible serial port was provided, {{as well as an}} infrared port for printing on compatible models of Hewlett Packard printers. In character mode, the display showed 16 lines of 40 characters and had no backlight. While most IBM compatible PCs work with a hardware code page 437, the HP 95LX's text mode font was hard-wired to code page 850 instead. Lotus 1-2-3 internally used the Lotus International Character Set (LICS), but characters were translated to code page 850 for display and printing purposes.|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{suspected}} that parasitic reaction products created at one electrode of a Li-ion battery can migrate to the other electrode and influence its operation. In order to demonstrate that these “electrode-electrode interactions ” do occur, four types of <b>coin</b> <b>cells</b> were investigated. Two of these were Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 -limited and LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4 -limited LiNi 0. 5 Mn 1. 5 O 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (LNMO/LTO) “full cells”. In order to prevent electrode-electrode interactions, LTO/Li and Li/LNMO <b>coin</b> <b>cells</b> were connected by a wire joining the negative (Li) sides of the two <b>coin</b> <b>cells</b> making a simulated LNMO/LTO Li-ion cell with separate electrolyte compartments for {{the positive and negative}} electrodes. Virtually no parasitic reactions were observed at the LTO electrode in Li/LTO cells as evidenced by a coulombic efficiency near 1. 0000. By contrast, severe electrolyte oxidation, leading to charge end point capacity slippage and poor coulombic efficiency was observed in Li/LNMO cells. The behavior of the simulated LNMO/LTO Li-ion cells could be well understood and predicted based on the behavior of the half cells. By contrast, true LNMO/LTO Li-ion cells showed severe parasitic reactions occurring at the LTO electrode due to electrolyte oxidation products from the LNMO electrode migrating to the LTO electrode. Understanding such electrode-electrode interactions is critical in making long-lived Li-ion batteries and also for understanding the mechanisms governing the function of electrolyte additives. Similar effects, albeit at much smaller effective currents, can be occurring in Li-ion cells with standard positive and negative electrodes. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society.
