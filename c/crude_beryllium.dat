40|$|A {{process for}} the removal of iron from <b>crude</b> <b>beryllium</b> sulfate {{solutions}} as obtained from beryl ore by means of liquid-liquid solvent extraction is described. This method consists of the extraction of the ferric thiocyanate complex from aqueous beryllium sulfate solution of the proper pH with a mixture of tributylphosphate and kerosene. Studies on mixer-settler and column operations are discussed. A column design for production use is presented along with expected construction, material and operating costs for a plant installation. Work performed under Contract No. AT(30 - 1) - 541. Work performed at the Brush Beryllium Company, Cleveland Ohio. "Date Declassified: January 6, 1956 " [...] P. [2]"June 25, 1953. ""NYO- 1116.

2500|$|Green Grass/Violet Club was {{the first}} UK-deployed weapon to {{dispense}} with the <b>crude</b> polonium and <b>beryllium</b> impact or crush type initiators used in Fat Man and other early US weapons together with the British Blue Danube and Red Beard. Instead it used an electronic neutron initiator (ENI) known as Blue Stone. This had the great advantage of being adjustable, allowing the neutron burst to be triggered at precisely the right moment. The burst heights of Green Grass were optimized for either maximum overpressure without allowing fireball contact with the ground, or to maximise the ground area subjected to a 6 psi overpressure; respectively [...] and [...] above ground level A barometric fuze was used, backed-up by an adjustable clockwork timer fuze with impact fuses as a final fail-safe. Most of these mechanisms originated from Blue Danube although the radar altimeter fuze was omitted. The electrical power for these fuzing mechanisms and the firing mechanisms of the 72-lens, [...] implosion device came from lead-acid accumulators located in {{the tail of the}} Blue Danube casing. These were commercially sourced six-volt motorcycle batteries.|$|R
