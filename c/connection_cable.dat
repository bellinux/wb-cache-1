40|$|Laminatedglass is {{composed}} of two glass layers and a thin intermediate PVB layer, strongly influencing PVB's viscoelastic behaviour its dynamic response. While natural frequencies are relatively easily identified even with simplified FE models, damping ratios are not identified with such an ease. In order to determine to what extent external factors influence dampingidentification, different tests have been carried out. The external factors considered, apart from temperature, are accelerometers, <b>connection</b> <b>cables</b> {{and the effect of}} the glass layers. To analyse the influence of the accelerometers and their <b>connection</b> <b>cables</b> a laser measuring device was employed considering three possibilities: sample without instrumentation, sample with the accelerometers fixed and sample completely instrumented. When the sample is completely instrumented, accelerometer readings are also analysed. To take into consideration the effect of the glass layers, tests were realised both for laminatedglass and monolithic samples. This paper presents in depth data analysis of the different configurations and establishes criteria for data acquisition when testing laminatedglass...|$|R
50|$|The Datasette {{has only}} one <b>connection</b> <b>cable</b> with a PCB edge {{connector}} at the computer end. All input/output signals to the datasette are all digital and so all digital to analog and vice versa is handled within the unit. Power is also included in this cable. The pinout is ground, +5 V DC, motor, read, write, key-sense. The sense signal monitors the play, rewind, and fast-forward buttons, but cannot differentiate between them. A mechanical interlock prevented any two of them being pressed at the same time. Unregulated 6.36 V DC is used to power the cassette motor.|$|E
50|$|To {{protect the}} {{operator}} and the equipment, and reduce power loss, an outer chassis must enclose the tuning circuit and its floating ground. The inner chassis {{can be reduced}} to a mounting platform within the outer chassis, elevated on insulators to separate the floating ground from contact with the other electrical grounds. In particular, the inner tuning circuit's metal mounting chassis, and the metal rods connected to adjustment knobs on the outer chassis must all be kept separate from the surface touched by the operator and from direct electrical contact with the transmitter's ground on its <b>connection</b> <b>cable.</b> This puts difficult constraints on the tuner's construction.|$|E

Also available are two sockets for tape recorder interface to facilitate offline patch backup and storage of sounds and other data.

50|$|Tag styluses {{have a low}} initial cost. Each Tag stylus starter {{system costs}} around $50.00 when {{purchased}} in retail stores which include the Tag stylus, a sampler book, a USB computer <b>connection</b> <b>cable,</b> and software disk. The individual books range anywhere from $10.00 to $20.00 {{and a variety of}} titles are available. Each phonics set is around $20.00 and contains 5 books. Leapfrog also sells bundles that can be purchased directly from their webpage that range between $70-$400. Before using the Tag stylus with a book, a software installation is required and an account set up with LeapFrog. Once the initial account is set up, then the Tag stylus must have the desired books' audio files downloaded to it. The stylus can hold multiple books at one time (from 4 to 10, {{depending on the size of}} the book and the amount of memory in the stylus). The Tag reader is powered by batteries.|$|E
