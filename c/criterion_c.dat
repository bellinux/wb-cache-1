40|$|Aims: To {{shorten the}} {{analysis}} time needed for non-stress testing (NST) without decreasing efficacy in compromised fetuses. Methods: We selected 80 cases with a 5 -min Apgar score &# 60; 7 as a study group and 259 cases with a 5 -min Apgar score ≥ 9 {{as a control}} group. We applied four different <b>criteria</b> (A, B, <b>C,</b> and D) to each study and control group for the first 20 -min window of NST data to evaluate reactivity. Criteria A, B, and C consisted of conventional reactivity criteria according to amplitude (15 or 10 beats per minute), duration (15 or 10  s) and weeks of gestation (≤ 31, ≥ 32), and criteria D combined <b>criteria</b> <b>C</b> with approximate entropy (ApEn). Results: The sensitivity of criteria D (91. 25 %) was greater than the other three criteria (P&# 60; 0. 0001). The specificities of <b>criteria</b> <b>C</b> (96. 14 %) and D (99. 23 %) were also higher than criteria A and B (P&# 60; 0. 0001). The positive and negative predictive value of criteria D were better than that of <b>criteria</b> <b>C</b> (97. 33 vs. 83. 87, P= 0. 0066) and (97. 35 vs. 89. 89, P= 0. 0004), respectively.

40|$|Introduction 1. 1 Models of categorisation: The `classical' theory vs. {{prototype}} theory The {{ability to}} categorise, to classify elements into classes, {{is one of}} the most basic abilities of human beings. It does, therefore, not come as a surprise that this ability was investigated in a multitude of studies. Until about 30 years ago, the so-called classical theory was the central theory of categorisation. According to this theory (ultimately based on Aristotle's ideas), a category C is defined by a set of n necessary and su#cient <b>criteria</b> (or conditions <b>c</b> 1, [...] .,c n), which often come in the form of binary attributes. Thus, an entity e is a member of C if and only if it exhibits all n criteria. It also follows that all members of C are equally good members of C because they all exhibit the required <b>criteria</b> <b>c</b> 1 to c n; also, the entitye either is or is not a member of C (depending on whether it exhibits the <b>criteria</b> <b>c</b> 1 to c n or not) [...] - a quasi interim status of entity e is not allo...|$|R
