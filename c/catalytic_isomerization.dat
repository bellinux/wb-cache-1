The treatment of I with acetic anhydride/pyridine or trifluoroacetic anhydride resulted in the selective and quantitative cyclodehydration to yield either imide or isoimide structures respectively. The imidization was accompanied by acylation of the ortho amino group to form lateral acetamide or trifluoroacetamide substitutes. Thermodynamically unstable N-(o-trifluoroacetamidophenyl) phthalisoimide (III) underwent secondary cyclization to yield ladder 1, 2 -benzoylenebenzimidazole (V) between 130 and 150 C. The conversion of this reaction did not exceed 35 % because it competed with the thermal isomerization of III to the stable N-(o-trifluoroacetamido-phenyl) phthalimide (IV). The cyclization of N-(o-trifluoroacetamidophenyl) phthalisoimide (III) {{was found to be}} possible even at room temperature.

40|$|The {{catalysts}} Î³-alumina (GA, {{the reference}} catalyst) and Pt doped Î³-alumina (PGA-s) were synthesized using a simple sol-gel technique, in which at first preparation of porous base (GA), then impregnation of platinum salt over {{the base and}} finally reduction of platinum in {{the surface of the}} support were done. These catalysts prepared in different mole ratios of Pt:Al as 2 : 1, 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 are named as PGA- 1, PGA- 2 and PGA- 3 respectively. The isomerization of n-alkanes (n-hexane, n-heptane and n-octane) were investigated over the synthesized catalysts. The 2 -methyl pentane (2 -MP), 2, 2 -dimethyl pentane (2, 2 -DMP) and 2, 3 -dimethyl hexane (2, 3 -DMH) are the major products of respective isomerization of n-hexane, n-heptane and n-octane, besides a small amount of other branched isomers are also produced. The product distribution is comparable to that reported for Pt based other catalysts. The optimal mole ratios of Pt:Al is 1 : 1 (PGA- 2) gives quite good <b>catalytic</b> activity for <b>isomerization</b> of n-alkane. Even through in reusability study, PGA- 2 gives better performance than others. We have mainly focused on kinetic study, reaction mechanism behind isomerization and calculated the order of reactions and activation energies of the isomerization reactions in the present work.

40|$|The {{present report}} deals with {{environmental}} issues in refineries and petrochemical processes. More precisely gaseous, liquid and solid effluents from processes are analysed qualitativelyand quantitatively when possible. Techniques to treat these effluents are reviewed or proposedwhen lacking and methods to {{do not produce}} these effluents are envisaged. In the part A of the report general effluents that are released from all types of processes arestudied. These effluents include fugitive emissions, flue gases from process heaters,blowdown systems emissions and wastewaters. Fugitive emissions, one of the greatestsources of VOCs can be qualified and quantified by the average emission factor approach andreduced thanks {{to the implementation of}} an LDAR program. Flue gases from process heaters,which are a major source of NOx, SOx and particulate matters can be characterized withemission factors and several techniques exist to treat or prevent these emissions. Concerningblowdown systems emissions, which are difficult to quantify, methods to minimize theseemissions are given. Finally, wastewaters treatment in petroleum industry is shortly describedbefore best management practices and pollution prevention methods are enounced. In the part B of the report four families of processes are studied: naphtha hydrotreatment,naphtha <b>isomerization,</b> <b>catalytic</b> reforming and hydrogenation in olefin plants. Each of theseprocesses is firstly described, the process flow diagram is explained and continuous andintermittent effluents are characterized. In addition to general effluents dealt with in part A, ithas been found that processes can produce other effluents such as dioxins in isomerization orcatalytic reforming units or green oils during catalyst regeneration operations.
