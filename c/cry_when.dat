5|$|Piaget {{concluded}} that some infants {{are too young}} to understand object permanence, which explains why they do not <b>cry</b> <b>when</b> their mothers are gone ("out of sight, out of mind"). A lack of object permanence can lead to A-not-B errors, where children reach for a thing at a place where it should not be. Older infants are less likely to make the A-not-B error because they are able to understand the concept of object permanence more than younger infants. However, researchers have found that A-not-B errors do not always show up consistently. They {{concluded that}} this type of error might be due to a failure in memory or the fact that infants usually tend to repeat a previous motor behavior.|$|E

[...] "There was so much left unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion.... I saw my mother, looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. Then I noticed that my mother's mouth looked funny. It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up. In that awful moment, I began to understand what I had lost forever.

Before that no one would do it." [...] Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: [...] "When [...] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should <b>cry</b> <b>when</b> he wants to cry."

2500|$|As Marla Heasley recounts in Bring Back... The A-Team (May 18, 2006), {{although}} sexism was not prevalent {{on the set}} per se, {{there was}} a sense that a female character was not necessary on the show. On her first day on set George Peppard took her aside and told her [...] "We don't want you on the show. None of the guys want you here. The only reason you're here is because the network and the producers want you. For some reason they think they need a girl." [...] The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again, saying: [...] "I'm sorry that this is your last day, but remember what I said the very first day, that we didn't want a girl, has nothing to do with you. You were very professional, but no reason to have a girl." [...] In Bring Back... the A-Team, Dirk Benedict also remarked that: [...] "It was a guy's show. It was male driven. It was written by guys. It was directed by guys. It was acted by guys. It's about what guys do. We talked the way guys talked. We were the boss. We were the God. We smoked when we wanted. We shot guns when we wanted.

It is what it is." [...] The following month, Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody described Lewis's version of the song as [...] "phenomenal". He told the Scottish newspaper The Daily Record: [...] Music Radar said that [...] "The two versions couldn't be more different. Snow Patrol's rendering is dark and moody, while Leona Lewis's is big-time pop", and quoted Gary Lightbody as saying [...] "That's what you want a song to do ... Different interpretations and meanings. Songs aren't monolithic, at least the good ones aren't. What Leona Lewis has done has touched hearts." [...] Newsround highly praised Lewis' cover version, stating that [...] "the full gospel choir and orchestra easily match Leona's powerful pipes – and remind listeners why the song made people <b>cry</b> <b>when</b> she first performed it on Radio 1's Live Lounge last year". [...] "Run" [...] received three stars out of five from Digital Spy, who said that Lewis [...] "wrings every last drop of emotion out of Gary Lightbody's lyrics, channeling her inner Mariah for some almighty warbling at the crescendo". The Sentinel described the single as [...] "so much better" [...] than Snow Patrol's original song. [...] "It's powerful, painful and the choir behind it takes it on to another level."

2500|$|Deburau's great successes {{had come}} in the [...] "pantomime-féerie", {{featuring}} frenetic (sometimes violent) action in a fairy-land of transformations, tricks, and triumphs. [...] Legrand's talents lay elsewhere. [...] It was in the subtle, even touching, dramas of his Pierrot that he found his métier, {{and it was in}} the [...] "realistic" [...] pantomime that he excelled. [...] At the Folies-Nouvelles he came into his maturity, as another review by Gautier suggests; this is of Pierrot Dandin (1854), written by the mime and Charles Bridault, and the review should be quoted at length:... what absolutely must be seen is Paul Legrand in Pierrot Dandin. [...] We doubt whether Tiercelin, who played cobblers so well that it is said he could have been transferred to the shoemakers, was ever better at drawing on his hand-leather, at manipulating the knife and the awl, at squaring a sole, at nailing a bit of leather over a frame: one would truly think he has done nothing but this all his life. —But where he is superb is in the scene in which, returning home with a dress, a little shawl, and an apple turnover he has brought for his wife, he finds the conjugal nest deserted and, in place of the unfaithful spouse, a letter revealing that Madame Pierrot has left with the seducer Leander. [...] It must indeed be difficult to make people <b>cry</b> <b>when</b> one is wearing a little black skullcap, when one is sporting a face plastered with flour and a ridiculous costume. [...] Well! [...] Paul Legrand expresses his sadness in such a naïve, true, touching, and profoundly heartfelt manner that the puppet disappears, leaving only the man. [...] In the stage-boxes, the giddiest madcaps forgot to run their tongues over their green barley-sugar sticks and smothered their sobs behind their lace handkerchiefs.So devoted was Legrand to this conception of the character—as sensitive and vulnerable, his juddering heart on his sleeve—that, when he was consigned to a pantomime recalling Deburau's stage, he simply turned it into one of his own. [...] The Pierrot of Pol Mercier's Bureaucrat Pierrot (1856) was conceived as a scamp and a layabout:In the administrative bureau of a railroad, Pierrot is a very lazy, very inaccurate clerk. [...] At the office he spends all his time in distracting his colleagues and playing a thousand little tricks on them. [...] Sometimes he eats this one's lunch; sometimes he drinks that one's little carafe of wine. 1023, MS 3408, sc. 1 (unpaginated), Archives Nationales de France, Paris; tr.
