5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of Anthozoans is not <b>clearly</b> <b>understood</b> and {{a number}} of different models have been proposed. Within the Hexacorallia, the sea anemones, coral anemones and stony corals may constitute a monophyletic grouping united by their six-fold symmetry and cnidocyte trait. The Octocorallia appears to be monophyletic, and primitive members of this group may have been stolonate. The cladogram presented here comes from a 2014 study by Stampar et al. which was based on the divergence of mitochondrial DNA within the group and on nuclear markers.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have known}} about the heart since ancient times, {{although}} its precise function and anatomy were not <b>clearly</b> <b>understood.</b> From the primarily religious views of earlier societies towards the heart, ancient Greeks are considered {{to have been the}} primary seat of scientific understanding of the heart in the ancient world. Aristotle considered the heart to be organ responsible for creating blood; Plato considered the heart as the source of circulating blood and Hippocrates noted blood circulating cyclically from the body through the heart to the lungs. Erasistratos (304–250 BCE) noted the heart as a pump, causing dilation of blood vessels, and noted that arteries and veins both radiate from the heart, becoming progressively smaller with distance, although he believed they were filled with air and not blood. He also discovered the heart valves.|$|E

5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner <b>clearly</b> <b>understood</b> that the {{insulation}} {{in such a}} suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.|$|E
5|$|The local {{language}} Kannada {{was mostly}} used in Western (Kalyani) Chalukya inscriptions and epigraphs. Some historians assert that {{ninety percent of}} their inscriptions are in the Kannada language while the remaining are in Sanskrit language. More inscriptions in Kannada are attributed to Vikramaditya VI than any other king prior to the 12th century, {{many of which have}} been deciphered and translated by historians of the Archaeological Survey of India. Inscriptions were generally either on stone (Shilashasana) or copper plates (Tamarashasana). This period saw the growth of Kannada as a language of literature and poetry, impetus to which came from the devotional movement of the Virashaivas (called Lingayatism) who expressed their closeness to their deity in the form of simple lyrics called Vachanas. At an administrative level, the regional language was used to record locations and rights related to land grants. When bilingual inscriptions were written, the section stating the title, genealogy, origin myths of the king and benedictions were generally done in Sanskrit. Kannada was used to state terms of the grants, including information on the land, its boundaries, the participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues, and witnesses. This ensured the content was <b>clearly</b> <b>understood</b> by the local people without any ambiguity.|$|E
5|$|The {{support of}} the Hoysala rulers for the Kannada {{language}} was strong, and this is seen even in their epigraphs, often written in polished and poetic language, rather than prose, with illustrations of floral designs in the margins. According to historian Sheldon Pollock, the Hoysala era saw the complete displacement of Sanskrit, with Kannada dominating as the courtly language. Temples served as local schools where learned Brahmins taught in Sanskrit, while Jain and Buddhist monasteries educated novice monks. Schools of higher learning were called Ghatikas. The local Kannada language was widely used in the rising number of devotional movements to express the ecstatic experience of closeness to the deity (vachanas and devaranama). Literary works were written in it on palm leaves which were tied together. While in past centuries Jain works had dominated Kannada literature, Shaiva and early Brahminical works became popular during the Hoysala reign. Writings in Sanskrit included poetry, grammar, lexicon, manuals, rhetoric, commentaries on older works, prose fiction and drama. Inscriptions on stone (Shilashasana) and copper plates (Tamarashasana) were written mostly in Kannada but some were in Sanskrit or were bilingual. The sections of bilingual inscriptions stating the title, genealogy, origin myths of the king and benedictions were generally done in Sanskrit. Kannada was used to state terms of the grants, including information on the land, its boundaries, the participation of local authorities, rights and obligations of the grantee, taxes and dues, and witnesses. This ensured the content was <b>clearly</b> <b>understood</b> by the local people without ambiguity.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause is}} not <b>clearly</b> <b>understood,</b> but {{is thought to}} be caused by a defect in embryologic development. This is in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy. The defect is thought to cause a {{proliferation}} of melanocytes. This means melanocytes, the cells in the body in charge of normal skin color, are being produced at an extremely fast rate. Thus causing the melanocytes to form in clusters instead of spread out, causing abnormal skin pigmentation in some areas of the body.|$|E
25|$|In biology, homochirality is {{a common}} {{property}} of amino acids and sugars; almost all biologically produced chiral amino acids are L-chiral, while sugars are D-chiral. While {{the origin of this}} phenomenon is not <b>clearly</b> <b>understood,</b> many different mechanism for the emergence of homochirality are proposed. One of the difficulties in determining the correct mechanism for the origin of homochirality stems from the ambiguity in its time line, and it is not clear when homochirality occurred in comparison to the origin of life.|$|E

25|$|In Toluca Otomi, the {{semantic}} {{difference between the}} two subjunctive forms (A and B) has not yet been <b>clearly</b> <b>understood</b> in the linguistic literature. Sometimes subjunctive B implicates that is more recent in time than subjunctive A. Both indicate something counterfactual. In other Otomi dialects, such as Otomi of Ixtenco Tlaxcala, the distinction between the two forms is one of subjunctive as opposed to irrealis. The Past and Present Progressive are similar in meaning to English 'was' and 'is X-ing', respectively. The Imperative is used for issuing direct orders.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{many of these}} {{relationships}} might be more <b>clearly</b> <b>understood</b> as mentoring relationships between adult men and young boys rather than an analog of marriage.

While the relationship was generally lifelong and of profound emotional significance to the participants, it was not considered marriage by contemporary culture, and the relationship continued even after participants reached age 20 and married women, as was expected in the culture.|$|E

However, formal BP still follows EP in avoiding starting a sentence with a proclitic pronoun; so both will write Deram-lhe o livro ("They gave him/her the book") instead of Lhe deram o livro, though it will seldom be spoken in BP (but would be <b>clearly</b> <b>understood).</b>|$|E
