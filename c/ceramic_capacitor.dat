25|$|The X2Y {{footprint}} {{results in}} lower mounted inductance. This is particularly {{of interest for}} use in high-speed digital circuits with clock rates of several 100MHz and upwards. There the decoupling of the individual supply voltages on the circuit board is difficult to realize due to parasitic inductances of the supply lines. A standard solution with conventional ceramic capacitors requires the parallel use of many conventional MLCC chips with different capacitance values. Here X2Y capacitors are able to replace up to five equal-sized ceramic capacitors on the PCB. However, this particular type of <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitor</b> is patented, so these components are still comparatively expensive.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} multi-layer <b>ceramic</b> <b>capacitor</b> {{has many}} opposing electrode layers stacked inside connected with two outer terminations. The X2Y ceramic chip capacitor however is a 4 terminal chip device. It is constructed like a standard two-terminal MLCC {{out of the}} stacked ceramic layers with an additional third set of shield electrodes incorporated in the chip. These shield electrodes surround each existing electrode within the stack of the capacitor plates and are low ohmic contacted with two additional side terminations across to the capacitor terminations. The X2Y construction results in a three-node capacitive circuit that provides simultaneous line-to-line and line-to-ground filtering.|$|E
