5|$|The {{decipherment}} of the Mycenaean Linear B script, {{a writing}} system adapted {{for the use}} of the Greek language of the Late Bronze Age, demonstrated the continuity of Greek speech from the second millennium BC into the eighth century BC when a new script emerged. Moreover, it revealed that the bearers of Mycenaean culture were ethnically connected with the populations that resided in the Greek peninsula after the end of this cultural period. Various <b>collective</b> <b>terms</b> for the inhabitants of Mycenaean Greece were used by Homer in his 8th century BC epic, the Iliad, in reference to the Trojan War. The latter was supposed to have happened in the late 13thearly 12th century BC, when a coalition of small Greek states under the king of Mycenae, besieged the walled city of Troy. Homer used the ethnonyms Achaeans, Danaans and Argives, to refer to the besiegers. These names appear to have passed down from the time they were in use to the time when Homer applied them as <b>collective</b> <b>terms</b> in his Iliad. There is an isolated reference to a-ka-wi-ja-de in the Linear B records in Knossos, Crete dated to c. 1400 BC, which most probably refers to a Mycenaean (Achaean) state on the Greek mainland.|$|R

30|$|The {{qualitative}} analysis revealed four metaphorical frames for privacy in the future: privacy as the dodo, as the hemline, as savings and as foundations of our home. Privacy was conceptualised either in individualistic or <b>collective</b> <b>terms.</b> For the individualistic framing, the key concern is individual control. For the collective framing, in turn, {{the central question}} is trust in collective means of protecting privacy. The lessons from this study for societal debate are twofold. Firstly, broad societal debate is needed on a desirable society {{and the role of}} privacy in that society, taking into account systemic interconnections and possible system traps. Secondly, the discussion needs to consider the whole ecosystem of different privacy conceptions, worldviews and framing metaphors.|$|R
