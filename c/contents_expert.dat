To find the information by reading, we have to know the main of the text. So, find the main ide on the paragraph is important to know the main information. But, finding the main idea of this unit is a unit that is reasonably difficult by some students in Primary School. This research discuss the development of learning subject in Indonesian language the unit of reading to finding the main idea with model of cooperative scripts for “A” 5 th grade at Miftahul Ulum Islamic Primary School of Batu, by focusing research: (1) How is the form of product readings to find the main idea with the models of cooperative script in Indonesian language lesson on 5 th grade at Miftahul Ulum Islamic Primary School of Batu?, (2) How is the feasibility of the product content readings to find the main idea with models of cooperative script in Indonesian language to fifth grade at Miftahul Ulum Islamic Primary School of Batu? This research was done on April 2014 at Miftahul Ulum Islamic Primary School of Batu. This research is research and development method by W.

30|$|To {{develop this}} document, we {{assembled}} {{a group of}} thought leaders and <b>content</b> <b>experts</b> to review the scientific literature {{and use it to}} formulate evidence-based statements about emergency POCUS. For this initial effort, we assembled members of a pediatric emergency POCUS work group, which wrote the recently published POCUS guidelines for pediatric emergency physicians [13, 14]. With collaboration from additional <b>content</b> <b>experts</b> in the field, who had either completed an ultrasound fellowship or specialty training in pediatric emergency POCUS, we sought to create a comprehensive document summarizing the current evidence. For each application, the evidence is reviewed with respect to indications, current knowledge (or lack of it), curriculum objectives for learners, and identified pitfalls. We also developed standardized reporting guidelines for each ultrasound indication. The reporting guidelines are intended as templates that sonologists may choose to use as a method of extracting and documenting appropriate information about ultrasound exams for reporting, quality assurance, and if desired, research. They are not intended as stepwise instructions on how to complete exams.

50|$|Supporters of {{the truly}} {{collaborative}} approach {{feel that there is}} no need for that authority to be a <b>content</b> <b>expert.</b> However, studies conducted at several medical schools across Canada, the USA and Europe dispute this idea. For example, in an analysis of student performance following small group experiences with experts and non expert tutors, students at the University of Michigan Medical School rated their experiences with <b>content</b> <b>experts</b> significantly higher than those led by non-experts. They felt that even though an expert tutor may ask the same questions as a non-expert tutor, that the expert was more inclined to ask the questions at the most opportune time and was better able to reframe the question in a way that was more valuable to the students. Ultimately, the students who were assigned to the groups led by <b>content</b> <b>experts</b> scored significantly higher on their final exam. In another study, conducted at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, it was determined that expert tutors use their knowledge to ask more effective questions and are better equipped to keep the groups from floundering. This raises the question of whether a process expert can adequately assess student progress and determine when intervention is optimal and beneficial.|$|R
