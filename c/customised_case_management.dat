On the basis of evidence of <b>case</b> <b>management's</b> effectiveness in saving health costs and providing better quality of care, <b>case</b> <b>management</b> strategies are currently being implemented {{in a variety of}} settings with different populations under a range of conditions. <b>Case</b> <b>management</b> services are assisted by knowledgeable and skilled healthcare professionals called case managers.

A case manager's educational preparation is the key to successful <b>case</b> <b>management.</b> In other countries, many formal and informal <b>case</b> <b>management</b> educational programs have become available to prepare the nursing profession for the demands of the job market. Six essential knowledge areas and three categories of skills are identified for <b>case</b> <b>management</b> education.

More specifically its aim was to investigate factors for the diffusion of <b>Case</b> <b>Management</b> and its differences to similar professional roles. The study was based on interviews with four managers at various levels and two case managers representing two municipalities in Sweden. Five themes were identified that were especially interesting when discussing the function of <b>Case</b> <b>Management,</b> its differences to similar professional roles and its diffusion in Swedish municipalities. The themes were: shortcomings in the welfare system, the functions of <b>Case</b> <b>Management,</b> differences to similar professional roles, descriptions of <b>Case</b> <b>Management</b> and factors for the diffusion.

40|$|Abstract Background In Germany, <b>case</b> <b>management</b> in a {{palliative care}} unit was first {{implemented}} in 2005 at the Department of Palliative Medicine at the University Hospital Cologne. One {{of the purposes}} of this <b>case</b> <b>management</b> is to deal with enquiries from patients and their relatives as well as medical professionals. Using the <b>Case</b> <b>Management</b> Process Model of the <b>Case</b> <b>Management</b> Society of America as a reference, this study analysed (a) how this <b>case</b> <b>management</b> was used by different enquiring groups and (b) how patients were identified for <b>case</b> <b>management</b> and for palliative care services. The first thousand enquiries were analysed considering patient variables, properties of the enquiring persons and the content of the consultations. Results Most enquiries to the <b>case</b> <b>management</b> were made by telephone. The majority of requests regarded patients with oncological disease (84. 3 %). The largest enquiring group was composed of patients and relatives (40. 8 %), followed by internal professionals of the hospital (36. 1 %). Most of the enquiring persons asked for a patient’s admission to the palliative care ward (46. 4 %). The second most frequent request was for consultation and advice (30. 9 %), followed by requests for the palliative home care service (13. 3 %). Frequent reasons for actual admissions were the need for the treatment of pain, the presence of symptoms and the need for nursing care. More than half of the enquiries concerning admission to the palliative care ward were followed by an admission. Conclusions <b>Case</b> <b>management</b> has been made public among the relevant target groups. <b>Case</b> <b>management</b> as described by the <b>Case</b> <b>Management</b> Process Model helps to identify patients likely to benefit from <b>case</b> <b>management</b> and palliative care services.

40|$|Background: In <b>case</b> <b>management</b> an {{individual}} or small team is responsible for navigating the patient through complex care. Characteristics of <b>case</b> <b>management</b> within and throughout different target groups and settings vary widely. <b>Case</b> <b>management</b> is relatively new in palliative care. Insight into the content of care and organisational characteristics of <b>case</b> <b>management</b> in palliative care is needed. Objectives: To investigate how many <b>case</b> <b>management</b> initiatives for palliative care {{there are in the}} Netherlands for patients living at home; to describe the characteristics of these initiatives with regard to content and organisation of care. Setting: Primary care. Design and participants: A nationwide survey of all 50 coordinators of networks in palliative care in the Netherlands was conducted. Additional respondents were found through snowball sampling. We looked at 33 possible initiatives using interviews (n= 33) and questionnaires (n= 30). Results: We identified 20 initiatives for <b>case</b> <b>management.</b> All stated that <b>case</b> <b>management</b> is supplemental to other care. In all initiatives the case managers are registered nurses and most possess higher vocational education and/or further training. All initiatives seek to identify the multidimensional care needs of the patients and the relatives and friends who care for them. Almost all provide information and support and refer patients who need care. Differences are found between the organisations offering the <b>case</b> <b>management,</b> their target groups, the names of the initiatives and whether direct patient care is provided by the case manager. Conclusions: In the Netherlands, <b>case</b> <b>management</b> in palliative care is new. Several models of delivery were identified.
