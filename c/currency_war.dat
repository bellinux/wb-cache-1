5000|$|Rickards' first book, <b>Currency</b> <b>Wars,</b> was {{published}} on November 10, 2011, by Portfolio, an imprint of Penguin Group. In it, Rickards argues that <b>currency</b> <b>wars</b> {{are not just}} an economic or monetary concern, but a national security concern. He maintains that the United States is facing serious threats to its national security, from clandestine gold purchases by China to the hidden agendas of sovereign wealth funds and that greater than any single threat is the very real danger {{of the collapse of}} the dollar itself. Rickards explains that the Federal Reserve is involved in what he calls [...] "the greatest gamble in the history of finance," [...] via a sustained effort to stimulate the economy by printing money on a trillion-dollar scale.|$|R
25|$|In {{the world}} of popular opinion, {{there had been an}} upsurge in vocal but {{minority}} opposition to the raw free market, with anti-globalization protests becoming increasingly notable after 1998. By 2007, there had been bestsellers promoting Keynesian or at least pro-mixed economy policies: Naomi Klein's The Shock Doctrine and Song Hongbing's <b>Currency</b> <b>Wars.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the 2007 book, <b>Currency</b> <b>Wars</b> by Chinese {{economist}} Song Hongbing, {{the term}} is sometimes used in a somewhat contrary sense, to refer to an alleged practice where unscrupulous bankers lend to emerging market countries and then speculate against the emerging state's currency by trying to force it down in value against the wishes of that states' government.|$|R
5|$|From {{the end of}} World War II {{until about}} 1971, the Bretton Woods system of semi-fixed {{exchange}} rates meant that competitive devaluation was not an option, {{which was one of}} the design objectives of the systems' architects. Additionally, global growth was generally very high in this period, so there was little incentive for <b>currency</b> <b>war</b> even if it had been possible.|$|E
5|$|In September, {{as part of}} her {{opening speech}} for the 66th United Nations Debate, and also in an article for the Financial Times, Brazilian {{president}} Dilma Rousseff called for the <b>currency</b> <b>war</b> to be ended by increased use of floating currencies and greater cooperation and solidarity among major economies, with exchange rate policies set for the good of all rather than having individual nations striving to gain an advantage for themselves.|$|E
5|$|Since September 2014, several journalists, {{commentators}} {{and financial}} sector insiders have again raised {{the prospect of}} further <b>currency</b> <b>war.</b> This time, rather than being intended {{as a means to}} boost competitiveness, some states, especially Japan and the Eurozone, may be motivated to devalue their currencies as a means to counter the threat of deflation. ECB President Mario Draghi has however denied any intent to engage in competitive devaluation.|$|E
40|$|The {{currency}} devaluation policy, implemented by developed countries {{after the last}} crisis, causes many negative consequences. It is defined as <b>currency</b> <b>wars,</b> with reference to similar situations in the twentieth century.

This policy may be beneficial if it takes into account the needs of all countries...|$|R
50|$|By {{creating}} $600 {{billion and}} inserting this directly into banks the Federal Reserve intended to spur banks to finance more domestic loans and refinance mortgages. However, banks instead were {{spending the money}} in more profitable areas by investing internationally in emerging markets. Banks were also investing in foreign currencies which Stiglitz and others point out may lead to <b>currency</b> <b>wars</b> while China redirects its currency holdings away from the United States.|$|R
40|$|The {{premise of}} beggar-thy-neighbor {{policies}} and <b>currency</b> <b>wars</b> is that <b>currency</b> depreciations lead to export growth. This premise, however, {{is far from}} validated as the existing economic literature largely either fails to find significant trade flow effects of currency fluctuations or finds that these effects are only minor. We revisit {{the question of whether}} currency fluctuations are systematically associated with trade flows using rich and unique firm level Chinese customs data on China-US trade over the 2000 to 2011 period that allows us to consider firm involvement in processing trade and firm dynamics in both export and import markets. Our firm-level based estimation of trade elasticities suggest that the China-US trade balance strongly responds to changes in the CNY/USD rate. This finding is particularly pronounced when we distinguish between ordinary and processing firms. Our results thus suggest that the influence of exchange rates on trade flows is stronger than previously thought and add insights to the policy debate on beggar-thy-neighbor policies and <b>currency</b> <b>wars</b> by, at least in principle, validating the underlying premise of such policies...|$|R
5|$|While {{some of the}} {{conditions}} to allow a <b>currency</b> <b>war</b> were in place at various points throughout this period, countries generally had contrasting priorities and at no point were there enough states simultaneously wanting to devalue for a <b>currency</b> <b>war</b> to break out. On several occasions countries were desperately attempting not to cause a devaluation but to prevent one. So states were striving not against other countries but against market forces that were exerting undesirable downwards pressure on their currencies. Examples include The United Kingdom during Black Wednesday and various tiger economies during the Asian crises of 1997. During the mid-1980s the United States did desire to devalue significantly, but were able to secure the cooperation of other major economies with the Plaza Accord. As free market influences approached their zenith during the 1990s, advanced economies and increasingly transition and even emerging economies moved {{to the view that}} it was best to leave the running of their economies to the markets and not to intervene even to correct a substantial current account deficit.|$|E
5|$|By 2009 {{some of the}} {{conditions}} required for a <b>currency</b> <b>war</b> had returned, with a severe economic downturn seeing global trade in that year decline by about 12%. There was a widespread concern among advanced economies {{about the size of}} their deficits; they increasingly joined emerging economies in viewing export led growth as their ideal strategy. In March 2009, even before international co-operation reached its peak with the 2009 G-20 London Summit , economist Ted Truman {{became one of the first}} to warn of the dangers of competitive devaluation. He also coined the phrase competitive non-appreciation.|$|E
5|$|From March 2013, {{concerns}} over further <b>currency</b> <b>war</b> diminished, though in November several journalists and analysts warned {{of a possible}} fresh outbreak. The likely principal source of tension appeared to shift once again, this time not being the U.S. versus China or the Eurozone versus Japan, but the U.S. versus Germany. In late October U.S. treasury officials had criticized Germany for running an excessively large current account surplus, thus acting as a drag on the global economy.|$|E
40|$|After a 30 -year absence, {{calls for}} {{international}} coordination of macroeconomic policy are back. This time the issues go by names like <b>currency</b> <b>wars,</b> taper tantrums, and fiscal compacts. In traditional game theory terms, {{the existence of}} spillovers may imply that countries are better off if they coordinate policies than under the Nash non-cooperative equilibrium. But {{what is the nature}} of the spillover and the coordination? The paper interprets recent macroeconomic history in terms of four possible frameworks for proposals to coordinate fiscal policy or monetary policy: the locomotive game, the discipline game, the competitive depreciation game (<b>currency</b> <b>wars)</b> and the competitive appreciation game. [The paper also considers claims that monetary coordination has been made necessary by the zero lower bound among advanced countries or financial imperfections among emerging markets. ] Perceptions of the sign of spillovers and proposals for the direction of coordination vary widely. The existence of different models and different domestic interests may be as important as the difference between cooperative and non-cooperative equilibria. In some cases complaints about foreigners’ actions and calls for cooperation may obscure the need to settle disagreements domestically...|$|R

5|$|Numerous senior central {{bankers and}} finance ministers issued public warnings, the first being Alexei Ulyukayev, the first deputy {{chairman}} at Russia's central bank. He was later joined by many others including Park Jae-wan, the finance minister for South Korea, and by Jens Weidmann, {{president of the}} Bundesbank. Weidmann held the view that interventions during the 2009–11 period were not intense enough to count as competitive devaluation, but that a genuine <b>currency</b> <b>war</b> is now a real possibility.

5|$|<b>Currency</b> <b>war,</b> {{also known}} as {{competitive}} devaluations, is a condition in international affairs where countries seek to gain a trade advantage over other countries by causing the exchange rate of their currency to fall {{in relation to other}} currencies. As the exchange rate of a country's currency falls exports become more competitive in other countries, and imports into the country become more expensive. Both effects benefit the domestic industry, and thus employment, which receives a boost in demand from both domestic and foreign markets. However, the price increases for import goods (as well as in the cost of foreign travel) are unpopular as they harm citizens' purchasing power; and when all countries adopt a similar strategy, it can lead to a general decline in international trade, harming all countries.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{competitive}} devaluations {{have been}} rare as countries have generally preferred {{to maintain a}} high value for their currency. Countries have generally allowed market forces to work, or have participated in systems of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when a <b>currency</b> <b>war</b> {{broke out in the}} 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used currency devaluations in an attempt to stimulate their economies. Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered to have been an adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in exchange rates reduced overall international trade.|$|E

40|$|Since the Eurozone’s Effilochement {{has become}} a fact and European {{integration}} theories, as defined in existing theories, falls short of offering a hope for the salvation of EU’s monetary integrity, the logic of geo-economy is prevailing among the European states. In particular, {{it means that the}} Eurozone has introduced currency warfare against the currencies of EU states that do not use the euro. The argument is that a paradigm shift away from solidarity towards quite narrow-minded policy has occurred; different from what has been understood by European integration thus far. This paper outlines a two - level geo-economic approach to analyse how and why the current Eurozone’s Effilochement - structural and political - are solved by means of <b>currency</b> <b>wars.</b> On a theoretical level, the paper argues that such behaviour systematically undermines the status of the euro as a currency of public trust and reframes the economic benefits and international importance of the EU. The empirical tier of the work shows that the euro is perceived as a differentiation tool to impede the tempo of the real enlargement process of the EU that began in 2004. The Eurozone’s efforts to adopt its exclusive institutional and governance structure despite the potential risks involved, provide all the elements of this demonstration. The conclusion leads to the thesis {{that we need to be}} think more about geo-economics, this specific example being <b>currency</b> <b>wars,</b> to discern whether this paradigm of IPE became either a hindrance or a vehicle of the European integration ‘game’. ...|$|R
5|$|Methods have {{included}} reducing {{the percentage of}} gold in coins, or substituting less precious metals for gold. However, until the 19th century, {{the proportion of the}} world's trade that occurred between nations was very low, so exchanges rates were not generally a matter of great concern. Rather than being seen as a means to help exporters, the debasement of currency was motivated by a desire to increase the domestic money supply and the ruling authorities' wealth through seigniorage, especially when they needed to finance wars or pay debts. A notable example is the substantial devaluations which occurred during the Napoleonic wars. When nations wished to compete economically they typically practiced mercantilism – this still involved attempts to boost exports while limiting imports, but rarely by means of devaluation. A favoured method was to protect home industries using current account controls such as tariffs. From the late 18th century, and especially in Britain, which, for much of the 19th century, was the world's largest economy, mercantilism became increasingly discredited by the rival theory of free trade, which held {{that the best way to}} encourage prosperity would be to allow trade to occur free of government imposed controls. The intrinsic value of money became formalised with a gold standard being widely adopted from about 1870–1914, so while the global economy was now becoming sufficiently integrated for competitive devaluation to occur there was little opportunity. Following the end of World War I, many countries other than the US experienced recession and few immediately returned to the gold standard, so several of the conditions for a <b>currency</b> <b>war</b> were in place. However, <b>currency</b> <b>war</b> did not occur as the U.K. was trying to raise the value of its currency back to its pre-war levels, effectively cooperating with the countries that wished to devalue against the market.|$|E
5|$|During the 1997 Asian crisis several Asian economies ran {{critically}} low {{on foreign}} reserves, leaving them {{forced to accept}} harsh terms from the IMF, and often to accept low prices for the forced sale of their assets. This shattered faith in free market thinking among emerging economies, and from about 2000 they generally began intervening to keep {{the value of their}} currencies low. This enhanced their ability to pursue export led growth strategies {{while at the same time}} building up foreign reserves so they would be better protected against further crises. No <b>currency</b> <b>war</b> resulted because on the whole advanced economies accepted this strategy—in the short term it had some benefits for their citizens, who could buy cheap imports and thus enjoy a higher material standard of living. The current account deficit of the US grew substantially, but until about 2007, the consensus view among free market economists and policy makers like Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Paul O'Neill, US Treasury secretary, was that the deficit was not a major reason for worry.|$|E

50|$|Action {{to reduce}} a {{substantial}} current account deficit usually involves increasing exports (goods {{going out of}} a country and entering abroad countries) or decreasing imports (goods coming from a foreign country into a country). Firstly, this is generally accomplished directly through import restrictions, quotas, or duties (though these may indirectly limit exports as well), or by promoting exports (through subsidies, custom duty exemptions etc.). Influencing the exchange rate to make exports cheaper for foreign buyers will indirectly increase the balance of payments. Also, <b>Currency</b> <b>wars,</b> a phenomenon evident in post recessionary markets is a protectionist policy, whereby countries devalue their currencies to ensure export competitiveness. Secondly, adjusting government spending to favor domestic suppliers is also effective.|$|R
