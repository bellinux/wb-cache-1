5000|$|Microcrystalline {{cellulose}} (MCC) is pure partially depolymerized cellulose synthesized from α-cellulose precursor. [...] The MCC can be synthesized {{by different}} {{processes such as}} reactive extrusion, enzyme mediated, steam explosion and acid hydrolysis. The later process can be done using mineral acids such as H2SO4, HCl and HBr as well as ionic liquids. The role of these reagents is to destroy the amorphous regions remaining the crystalline domains. The degree of polymerization is typically less than 400. The MCC particles with size lower than 5 µm must not be more than 10%. The MCC is a valuable additive in pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic and other industries. Different properties of MCC are measured to qualify its suitability to such utilization, namely particle size, density, <b>compressibility</b> <b>index,</b> angle of repose, powder porosity, hydration swelling capacity, moisture sorption capacity, moisture content, crystallinity index, crystallite size and mechanical properties such as hardness and tensile strength. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are also important to predict the thermal behavior of the MCC upon heat stresses.|$|E

Here, a significantly reduced height of sand surcharge could be applied because excess pore pressure was reduced by vacuum preloading. The performance of the embankment was evaluated under different vacuum pressure conditions during which the suction head could not be maintained in the field due to probable air leaks. In the analysis, therefore, the magnitude of applied vacuum pressure was based on field measurements and adjusted accordingly.

The compressibility/swell characteristics of the soil are influenced by nitrate contamination, {{as shown by the}} variation in the values of the coefficient of permeability, coefficient of consolidation, compression and swell indices (k, cv, Cc and Cs). This implies that the swell potential, magnitude and rate of settlement are affected. These properties directly influence the performance of shallow structural foundations. It was concluded that lack of chemical analysis for soil and groundwater in a nitrate contamination prone area before construction could lead to an overestimation of the swell and <b>compressibility</b> <b>indices</b> for the site. Permeability of the clayey soil increased significantly with increase in nitrate contamination, this portends the danger of emerging breakthrough of contaminants in the shallow contaminated zone through the underlying clayey layer to deeper confined aquifers being relied upon for portable drinking water...|$|R

The hydraulic conductivity and transfer of water and other substances through sand-clay mixtures are of prime concern in the design of liners and hydraulic barriers. Many successful research studies have been undertaken to achieve appropriate mixtures that satisfy hydraulic conductivity requirements. This study investigates compressibility and swelling properties of mixtures to ensure that they were acceptable for light structures, roads, and slabs on grade. A range of sand-expansive clay mixtures were investigated for swell and compression properties. The swelling and <b>compressibility</b> <b>indices</b> were found to increase with increasing clay content. The use of highly expansive material can result in large volume changes due to swell and shrinkage. The inclusion of less expansive soil material as partial replacement of bentonite by one-third to two-thirds is found to reduce the compressibility by 60 % to 70 % for 10 % and 15 % clay content, respectively.

The conventional radial consolidation theory (including smear and well resistance) have been commonly employed to predict the behaviour of vertical drains in soft clay. Its mathematical formulation is based on the small strain theory, and for a given stress range, a constant volume compressibility (mv) and a constant coefficient of lateral permeability (kh) are assumed. However, the value of mv varies along the consolidation curve over a wide range of applied pressure (Dp). In the same manner, kh also changes with the void ratio (e).

The proposed method can offer a simple method for microsphere preparation in an aqueous system with {{the elimination of the}} use of organic solvents that are usually needed in conventional techniques of microencapsulation. The interaction between negatively charged egg albumin molecules in phosphate buffer, pH 7. 2, or sodium hydroxide solution and positively charged chitosan molecules dissolved in diluted acetic acid to form an insoluble precipitate was the principle for the formation of the microspheres. The effects of many process variables, such as amount of formaldehyde as a cross-linking agent, stirring time, final pH of encapsulation medium, initial drug loading, and albumin concentration or albumin-to-chitosan weight ratio, on the properties of the prepared microspheres were investigated. Incorporation efficiencies of the microspheres to the drug were high in most cases and ranged between 63. 3 +/- 3. 6 % and 92. 39 +/- 3. 2 %, while particle sizes were 435. 2 +/- 12. 6 up to 693. 9 +/- 34. 6 microm for the different tested batches. On the other hand, the values of angles of repose and <b>compressibility</b> <b>indices</b> were in the range of 23. 5 +/- 0. 4 to 32. 0 +/- 0. 7 degrees and 11. 1 +/- 0. 7 % to 23. 6 +/- 0. 7 % respectively, which indicate overall good free flowing nature of the microspheres of all batches. The maximum required amount of the cross-linking agent was determined to avoid excessive unnecessary chemicals. It was also noticed that excessive time of stirring and excessive initial drug loading are not recommended as it may lead to microspheres of low properties. The pH of the encapsulation media (pH 3. 77 up to pH 4. 91) significantly affected the properties of the microspheres. As the pH of the encapsulation media was increased, the incorporation efficiency, particle size, and flowability decreased, along with increase of drug release rate, which could be related to incomplete cross linking of the microspheres matrix. It was also observed that high concentration of albumin solution and accordingly the increase of albumin-to-chitosan weight ratio were accompanied with increases in incorporation efficiency and particle size with improved microsphere flowability and slow indomethacin release. Thus, the proposed microspheres showed the ability to control the release of indomethacin, and their properties were highly affected by many process variables that could be controlled to obtain an optimized system...|$|R

The collected samples were subjected to laboratory investigations for the determination of geotechnical parameters namely liquid limits, plastic limits and compression indices. Based on experimental results, correlations between the soil index properties (liquid limit & plasticity index) and compression index were evaluated.

40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} {{physical}} properties affecting the flowability {{of the commercial}} rice flour. This flour / powder were selected because of the flow issues encountered by the mills / industries during bulk handling. A number of powder physical properties, including moisture content, particle size distribution, bulk density, <b>compressibility</b> <b>index,</b> angle of repose and co-efficient of friction were measured. Powder flowability was {{measured in terms of}} cohesive index, caking strength and powder flow speed dependency. These properties are used in interpreting the flow behaviour of the commercial rice flour...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This	study	evaluated	the	{{technological}}	feasibility	of	producing	a	semipurifi	ed extract of guaraná (Paullinia cupana Kunth, Sapindaceae) in tablet form, using a direct-compression process. Maltodextrin and {{gum arabic}} {{were used to}} produce the extract microparticles, {{in order to protect}} the microparticles against such factors as temperature, oxidation, and humidity. Using pharmacopoeial methodologies, technological and physicochemistry tests (determination of residual moisture, of bulk and tapped density, Hausner ratio, <b>compressibility</b> and compactibility <b>index,</b> appearance, mean weight, hardness, friability, disintegration time, determination of EPA amount in tablets and in vitro release profi	le) 	 were	conducted. The	formulation	containing	 200 	mg	of	microparticles, 170 mg microcrystalline cellulose, and 10 mg lactose gave the best results in terms of hardness (116 N), friabilility (0. 28 %), mean weight (0. 3821 g), and disintegration time (25 min) for a tablet designed for oral administration. The results met pharmacopoeial specifi cations,	 and	the	tablets	are	suitable	for	oral	administration.

40|$|Response surface {{methodology}} (RSM) is used {{to analyze}} the effect of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and talc powder (talc) on the objective (radial expansion ratio, bulk density, <b>compressibility,</b> and spring <b>index)</b> attributes of a biodegradable cushioning extrudate. A rotatable central composite design (CCD) {{is used to}} develop models for the objective responses. The experiments are run at 125 degrees C with a feed rate of 27. 8 L/h, a screw speed of 215 rpm, and a die diameter of 3. 92 mm. Responses are most affected by changes in PVA levels {{and to a lesser extent}} by talc levels. Individual contour plots of the different responses are overlaid, and regions meeting the optimum radial expansion ratio of 3. 14, the bulk density of 0. 106 g/cm(3), the compressibility of 56. 12 N, and the spring index of 0. 892 are identified at the PVA level of 32 % and the talc level of 4 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Response surface {{methodology}} (RSM) {{was used}} to analyse the effect of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) on the objective attributes (shipping bulk density, radial expansion ratio, <b>compressibility</b> and spring <b>index)</b> of a biodegradable cushioning extrudate. A rotatable central composite design (CCD) {{was used to}} develop models for the objective responses. The experiments were run at 105 degreesC with a feed rate of 27. 8 l/h, screw speed 500 r. p. m. and die diameter 3. 92 mm. Responses were most affected by changes in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) levels {{and to a lesser}} extent by calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) levels. Individual contour plots of the different responses were overlaid, and regions meeting the optimum shipping bulk density of 6. 00 kg/m(3). radial expansion ratio of 3. 30, compressibility of 43. 71 N, and spring index of 0. 91 were identified at the PVA level of 20. 23 % and the CaCO 3 level of 7. 89 %, respectively.
