5|$|The Brewers {{were members}} of the American League until 1997, when <b>Commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> offered the team the option to switch leagues due to a {{realignment}} of Major League Baseball's divisions. The Brewers have been members of the National League since 1998.|$|E
5|$|The first Jackie Robinson Day was on April 15, 2004. That {{day was a}} {{start to}} an annual {{tradition}} throughout Major League Baseball and an inspirational reminder about what happened on that day exactly fifty-seven years earlier when Jackie Robinson became a Major League Baseball player. The day {{would be the first}} official league-wide Jackie Robinson Day, having festivities taking place at all 23 ballparks where Major League games were scheduled to be played. Baseball <b>Commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> made the announcement with Sharon Robinson (daughter of Rachel and Jackie Robinson).|$|E
5|$|April 15, 2005, was the 58th {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Baseball <b>Commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> officially {{declared}} that every April 15 would be designated as Jackie Robinson Day {{and it would}} be celebrated each year throughout Major League Baseball. Every ballpark in Major League Baseball in the United States celebrated Jackie Robinson Day, unlike in 2004 when it was only celebrated in 13 ballparks. Each ballpark showed a video tribute to Robinson, and many brought out Jackie Robinson Foundation scholars onto the field before the games. In Cincinnati, Ohio, Ken Griffey, Jr. spoke of how much every African-American baseball player owes Robinson, who was chosen by manager Branch Rickey to break the color line because of Robinson's inner courage and ability to keep his temper in check.|$|E
50|$|Hershel Martin was former MLB <b>commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig's</b> {{favorite}} player as a youngster.|$|R

50|$|DuPuy left MLB in {{the fall}} of 2010 after 8½ years as the commissioner's top aide. During his twelve years at MLB, he led the {{formation}} of Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which includes MLB's website. He agreed to <b>commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig's</b> request that he continue to work on various MLB special projects.|$|R
5|$|The {{incorrect}} call {{led many}} baseball writers {{to call for}} {{the increased use of}} instant replay in baseball, which was used only to review disputed boundaries on home runs during the 2010 season. Many journalists also advocated for MLB <b>commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> to overturn Joyce's call and award a perfect game to Galarraga. On June 3, Selig announced that Major League Baseball would look at expanded replay and umpiring, but he did not specifically address Joyce's call. A baseball official familiar with the decision confirmed to The Associated Press that the call was not being reversed. For his efforts in this game, Galarraga was named the American League Player of the Week on June 7. Also, first base, a ball used in the game, and Galarraga's spikes were sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in {{the season}} <b>Commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> {{expressed}} interest in scheduling a World Series game during daylight hours instead of the evening. The starting times were ultimately moved before 8p.m. ET {{for the first time}} in 30 years, but no day games were played. The Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) played across the street from Citizens Bank Park at Lincoln Financial Field on the day of Game4. The NFL moved that game's kickoff time to 1p.m. to avoid it ending too close to the start of Game4. Similarly, Game5 was played at Citizens Bank Park on the same day as the Philadelphia Flyers hosted the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL) at the Wachovia Center. The opening faceoff of the hockey game was scheduled for 7p.m. but the NHL moved it to 5p.m. to avoid conflict.|$|E
5|$|The <b>commissioner,</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig,</b> {{was not in}} {{attendance}} in this game but was represented by the Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations, Jimmie Lee Solomon. Selig called Bonds later that night to congratulate him on breaking the record. President George W. Bush also called Bonds {{the next day to}} congratulate him. On August 24, San Francisco honored and celebrated Bonds's career accomplishments and breaking the home run record with a large rally in Justin Herman Plaza. The rally included video messages from Lou Brock, Ernie Banks, Ozzie Smith, Joe Montana, Wayne Gretzky and Michael Jordan. Speeches were made by Willie Mays, Giants teammates Omar Vizquel and Rich Aurilia, and Giants owner Peter Magowan. Mayor Gavin Newsom presented Bonds the key to the City and County of San Francisco and Giants vice president Larry Baer gave Bonds the home plate he touched after hitting his 756th career home run.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{in keeping}} with <b>Commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig's</b> desire for {{expanded}} interleague play, the Houston Astros were shifted from the National to the American League; with an odd number (15) in each league, an interleague contest was played somewhere almost every day during the season. At this time the divisions within each league were shuffled to create six equal divisions of five teams.|$|R

5|$|As an {{exception}} to the retired-number policy, MLB began honoring Robinson by allowing players to wear number 42 on April 15, Jackie Robinson Day, which is an annual observance that started in 2004. For the 60th anniversary of Robinson's major league debut, MLB invited players to wear the number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day in 2007. The gesture was originally the idea of outfielder Ken Griffey, Jr., who sought Rachel Robinson's permission to wear the number. After receiving her permission, <b>Commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> not only allowed Griffey to wear the number, but also extended an invitation to all major league teams to do the same. Ultimately, more than 200 players wore number 42, including the entire rosters of the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, and Pittsburgh Pirates. The tribute was continued in 2008, when, during games on April 15, all members of the Mets, Cardinals, Washington Nationals, and Tampa Bay Rays wore Robinson's number 42. On June 25, 2008, MLB installed a new plaque for Robinson at the Baseball Hall of Fame commemorating his off-the-field impact on the game as well as his playing statistics. In 2009, all uniformed personnel (players, managers, coaches, and umpires) wore number 42 on April 15.|$|E
5|$|The final {{incident}} occurred in 1998, when Alfonso Soriano {{was unable to}} leave the Hiroshima Toyo Carp due to contract restrictions. Soriano disliked the intense Japanese practice schedule, and the Carp denied him a salary increase from $45,000 (the league's minimum) to $180,000 per year. Like Nomo and Irabu, Soriano hired Nomura to help his situation. After first attempting to void Soriano's NPB contract by unsuccessfully arguing that the player was legally a minor when he signed it Nomura advised him, like Nomo, to retire from NPB and pursue a career in MLB. This prompted Carp executives to file an injunction against Soriano and send letters to MLB teams demanding that they cease all negotiations with him. NPB officials claimed that after the Nomo case they had privately amended the Player Contract to give NPB teams the right to prohibit a player from signing a new contract anywhere after voluntarily retiring. Since MLB officials were not consulted {{and they did not}} agree to any changes, MLB <b>Commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> declared that MLB would recognize Soriano as a free agent on July 13, 1998, and the Carp backed down. He signed a 5-year, $3.1million contract with the New York Yankees the same year.|$|E
25|$|This World Series {{was marked}} by a {{controversy}} involving the Minute Maid Park roof. MLB & <b>Commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> insisted that the Astros must play with the roof open which mitigated the intensity and enthusiasm of the cheering Astros fans.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2012, <b>Commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig's</b> [...] "blue ribbon" [...] committee, {{which had}} been {{implemented}} to study potential ballpark locations for the Athletics, met with Oakland and San Jose officials. At the Oakland meeting, the committee was met with {{a proposal for a}} ballpark on the site of Howard Terminal, a container terminal on the Oakland waterfront near Jack London Square currently owned by the Port of Oakland. Lew Wolff stated the site [...] "has no ability to be implemented for a ballpark.". Major League Baseball, however, has stated that it is their preferred location for a new ballpark in Oakland.|$|R

25|$|Pappas wrote prolifically about {{baseball}} economics, analyzing and debunking what he perceived as false information spread by Major League Baseball and sympathetic media outlets.

25|$|MLB <b>Commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> briefly {{considered}} {{whether or}} not to punish Rodriguez for his admitted steroid use, citing the illegality of the situation, among other things. However, {{at the time of the}} testing there were no punishments for this sort of activity. Additionally, his admission to three years of steroid use could be damaging to his image and legacy.|$|E

Michael Weiner, the union general counsel, also declined comment. The union, while fighting to get the list back from the government, has mostly refused to discuss reports. Likewise, Sosa never admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs nor did he ever fail an MLB drug test throughout his professional career.|$|R

2500|$|In 1996, Boras used {{an obscure}} {{provision}} in the major league rules to have draft picks Matt White (seventh overall pick, San Francisco Giants) and Bobby Seay (12th overall pick, Chicago White Sox) declared free agents. White and Seay both then signed with the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays, with White receiving a $10.2 million contract and Seay receiving a $3 million bonus, significantly more than {{what they would have}} received via the draft process. The following year, Major League Baseball changed its rules in response to Boras's success in circumventing the draft, which had resulted in at least $25 million in extra money for his clients. For many years, being [...] "outsmarted" [...] by Boras and losing Seay remained a sore spot for White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, one of <b>Commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig's</b> closest allies.|$|R
25|$|<b>Commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> {{imposed a}} very strict anti-drug policy upon its minor league players, {{who are not}} part of the Major League Baseball Players Association (the PA). Random drug testing, {{education}} and treatment, and strict penalties for those caught were the rule of law. Anyone on a Major League team's forty man roster, including 15 minor leaguers that are on that list, were exempt from that program. Some called Selig's move a public relations stunt, or window dressing.|$|E
25|$|The 2002 All-Star Game, held in Milwaukee, {{ended in}} {{controversy}} in the 11th inning when both teams ran out of substitute players available to pitch in relief. At that point, <b>Commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> (a Milwaukee native and former owner of the Brewers) declared that the game would end after 11 innings, and it ended in a 7–7 tie. The crowd booed and threw beer bottles onto the field, and the media were highly critical of this unsatisfactory conclusion.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Boras filed a {{grievance}} {{on behalf of}} Adrián Beltré because the Los Angeles Dodgers falsified Beltré's Dominican Republic birth records prior to signing him in 1994. Team representatives changed the records in order to sign Beltré {{when he was only}} 15 (under baseball rules international prospects are not eligible to sign until they are 16). In response to Boras's grievance, <b>Commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> awarded Beltré damages of $48,500. Additionally, Selig imposed significant penalties on the Dodgers.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 2013 season, <b>Commissioner</b> of Baseball <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> {{promoted}} Manfred {{to chief}} operating officer of MLB.

25|$|Under normal conditions, {{games are}} {{considered}} to be official games after five innings, or four and a half if the home team is leading at that point. However, post-season games are operated by the Commissioner's Office, thus are subject to the Commissioner's discretion of how to handle the scheduling of the games. So, with rain in the forecast for Philadelphia, <b>Commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> informed both the Rays and the Phillies management before the game began that a team {{would not be allowed to}} clinch the Series in a rain-shortened game.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Kevin Kennedy {{took over}} {{managerial}} duties, {{presiding over the}} team for two seasons, keeping the 1993 Rangers {{in the hunt for}} a playoff berth into mid-September.

The strike prematurely ended what could have been the Rangers' first division championship when <b>commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> canceled the remainder of the season and the playoffs. Regardless of the unceremonious end to the 1994 season, Kenny Rogers pitched the 12th perfect game in Major League history on July 28.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, Baseball <b>commissioner</b> <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig</b> {{announced}} that Major League Baseball would appoint a representative {{to take over}} all business and day-to-day operations of the Dodgers. The move was likely instigated by media reports that owner Frank McCourt had to arrange a $30 million loan from Fox to cover the teams payroll as well as uncertainty over the teams ownership situation relating to the ongoing divorce litigation. On April 25, Selig appointed former Texas Rangers president Tom Schieffer {{to be the man}} in charge of the Dodgers situation.|$|E
50|$|Buice {{entered into}} a {{four-year}} contract with the company. After the strike in 1994/95 was resolved, Upper Deck gave Buice six more years of ownership {{in the form of}} a contract extension. De Wayne Buice never worked for Upper Deck. Buice made the contact between Hemrick and the-then de facto <b>commissioner</b> of baseball, <b>Bud</b> <b>Selig,</b> which earned Buice a twelve percent stake in the company.
