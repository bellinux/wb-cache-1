New paving, benches, trees, bins, a multi-purpose structure and ground services were installed. The Rundle Mall master plan also included a <b>catenary</b> <b>lighting</b> system to be supported by four 20m poles at either end {{of the mall}} and brackets on a number of building facades.|$|E

40|$|This study defines fog as an aerosol {{consisting}} {{primarily of}} water droplets. The main effect on road traffic is the contrast reduction {{as a result}} of the scatter of light in the aerosol. Absorption plays only a small role. The effect of the contrast reduction is that many objects in the field of view, that are very easily visible in a clear atmosphere, cannot be seen properly, and often not at all, during fog. It appears that fog is a considerable traffic safety hazard on all roads, particularly on motorways. The study also discusses how far road lighting can help to reduce the accident risks that arise in fog on motorways. Road lighting appears to be an effective road safety measure on motorways. The benefits are especially in fog. It is recommended to install general purpose lighting systems on motorways, particularly in fog-prone regions. It is also recommended to apply length-wise mounted <b>catenary</b> <b>lighting</b> systems equipped with low-pressure sodium lamps for general purpose lighting for motorways in fog-prone areas. The study is based on a paper presented at Japan Highway Corporation, Tokyo, 12 July 1990...|$|E
