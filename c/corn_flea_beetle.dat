50|$|The <b>corn</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> {{feeds on}} corn leaf tissue and then transmits the P. stewartii {{bacterium}} into the plant. When large populations of corn flea beetles are feeding, skeletonization {{of leaves and}} death of seedlings can occur.|$|E
50|$|Then, in 1895, F.C. Stewart {{observed}} wilt in sweet-corn {{plants in}} Long Island, NY. After completion of Koch's postulates with the bacteria in sweet corn, Stewart gave an accurate {{account of the}} symptoms and named the pathogen Pseudomonas stewartii in 1898. With {{the help of his}} colleagues, Stewart concluded that the bacteria were readily disseminated by seed.

50|$|The {{disease is}} seen in parts of Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. Its {{occurrence}} in other eastern and Stewart’s wilt has two phases of symptoms: the wilt phase and the leaf blight phase. For both phases, symptoms first appear as leaf lesions, initiating from <b>corn</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> feeding scars. At first, the leaf lesions appear long and irregularly shaped and are light green to yellow and later on, straw colored. On mature plants, yellowish streaks with wavy margins extend along the leaf veins. This leaf blight phase is often prevalent after tasseling and the symptoms look similar to frost damage, drought, nutrient disorders, northern corn leaf blight (caused by Exserohilum turcicum), and particularly Goss's wilt (caused by Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. nebraskensis). A good way {{to determine if the}} corn is facing symptoms from Stewart's wilt {{is to look at the}} leaf tissue under microscope. If the bacterial ooze exhibits nonflagellated, nonspore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria, the likelihood of Stewart's wilt is great.|$|E

50|$|Chaetocnema pulicaria, {{the primary}} vector for P. stewartii, overwinters as adults and begins feeding on corn {{seedlings}} {{early in the}} spring. The bacterium overwinters in the gut of the adult <b>corn</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetles.</b> Warmer winter temperatures allow for greater beetle survival and in effect, higher populations in the spring. Emerging beetles in the spring transmit the bacteria into corn leaf tissue through feeding. The <b>corn</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> wound the leaf and contaminate the wounds with insect frass (excrement), which additionally contains the bacteria. Once the bacteria are inside the plant, they multiply and fill the xylem and intercellular spaces of the leaves. The degree of multiplication is highly dependent on susceptibility of the cultivar. Highly susceptible plants become systemically infected and face symptoms such as stunting, wilting, and death. In less severe cases, a plant may show long and irregularly shaped leaf lesions. Some genotypes are able to greatly restrict pathogenic growth. In such plants, the leaf lesions are short, insignificant, or may even be nonexistent. In certain corn varieties, kernels can be infected later in the growing season after flowering occurs. Although corn kernels can {{be a source of}} inoculum, seed transmission is quite rare.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the biology {{and importance of}} the <b>corn</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> vector {{and its role in}} the Stewart's disease of corn pathosystem. This was accomplished by determining the number of <b>corn</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> generations that occur in Iowa and by quantifying the proportions of those populations found to be infested with the causal agent of Stewart's disease, pantoea stewartii. In addition, a preliminary study was conducted to determine how soil temperature was influenced by air temperature and how this may be applied to forecasting for Stewart's disease of corn. Research using yellow sticky cards and sweep netting demonstrated that there are overwintering, first, and second field generations of the <b>corn</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> in Iowa. It was also observed that there was a period during June of both 1999 and 2000 when corn flea beetles were not found, which is important new management information. This research has also demonstrated that the incidence of P. stewartii-infested corn flea beetles can be monitored by ELISA testing and that the incidence fluctuates greatly throughout the corn growing season. The initial level of inoculum (P. stewartii-infested corn flea beetles in the adult overwintering generation) does not remain static during the spring as was previously hypothesized. This signals that additional research is needed concerning the mechanisms of fluctuation in the proportion of beetles infested with P. stewartii...|$|E

40|$|When {{developing}} reliable {{disease management}} programs, {{it is important}} to ascertain the most reliable method to quantify the potential sources of inoculum for an epidemic.

50|$|<b>Flea</b> <b>beetles</b> do {{not survive}} in the {{northern}} half of Illinois due to low winter temperatures. Those found in late spring or summer have migrated from the south. Snow or other winter cover apparently provides insufficient shelter to enhance survival of the overwintering <b>flea</b> <b>beetles.</b> Prolonged periods of wet summer weather are unfavorable for beetle multiplication and feeding, while dry weather is favorable. Consequently, although this disease has been found throughout the world, the bacterium has never survived and spread other than in North America, because the disease depends on where C. pulicaria occurs. In North America, Stewart’s wilt {{is found in the}} mid-Atlantic and the Ohio River Valley regions and in the southern portion of the Corn Belt. This region includes parts of Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, and West Virginia. Stewart’s wilt can also be found in eastern and midwestern states and portions of Canada, but this depends on whether or not the <b>corn</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> survive the winters. <b>Corn</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> can transmit the bacteria northward during the summer, but if the insect vectors cannot survive the harsh winter temperatures, then the bacteria cannot be spread. The toothed <b>flea</b> <b>beetle,</b> adult 12-spotted cucumber beetle, seed corn maggot, wheat wireworm, white grubs, and larvae of corn rootworms can also carry P. stewartii from one plant to another during the summer.

The ability of black <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> to control leafy spurge in any given year, however, has been found to vary. To better understand the long-term effects of <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> herbivory on leafy spurge, we monitored stem counts of leafy spurge and numbers of black and brown <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> at three sites on two National Wildlife Refuges in east-central North Dakota, USA, from 1998 to 2006.

40|$|AbstractPantoea stewartii is {{the causal}} agent of Stewart's wilt of sweet corn, {{the most serious}} {{bacterial}} disease of sweet corn and maize in the North-Central and Eastern USA. P. stewartii is transmitted mainly by the <b>corn</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> Chaetocnema pulicaria (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and this bacterium is assumed to overwinter in its vector beetle. Using immunofluorescence confocal and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) we localized P. stewartii in its host plant and insect vector. In infected maize, P. stewartii was found mainly in xylem vessels of major and minor veins {{as well as in}} intercellular spaces of infected leaves. In the vector beetle, P. stewartii was found by immunofluorescence in the foregut, midgut and hindgut up to 12 days post-acquisition (post-feeding on infected plants for 2 days). TEM of thin sections in the beetle's gut four and eight days post-acquisition revealed bacterial cells similar to those of P. stewartii in the gut lumen, close to or associated with the gut microvilli, as well as inside epithelial cells of the midgut. This suggests a stronger biological relationship between this bacterium and its vector, and that the <b>corn</b> <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> may carry P. stewartii intracellularly as well as extracellularly within the gut, which has implications in the persistence and overwintering of this bacterium in the vector and on the epidemiology of Stewart's wilt disease of corn...|$|E
