40|$|The precursors, [35 S]sulfate and [2 - 3 H]mannose, {{were used}} to study the {{biosynthesis}} of keratan sulfate and other oligosaccharides on proteoglycans isolated from Day 8 cultures of chick limb bud chondrocytes. After alkaline borohydride treatment, three fractions with sialic acid were separated by molecular sieve chromatography. The first contained keratan sulfate which was purified by digestion with chondroitinase to remove chondroitin sulfate, followed by molecular sieve and ion exchange chromatography. The purified keratan sulfate contained about 8 % of the 35 S activity originally in monomer. The chains had an average length of about 40 monosaccharides and contained only trace amounts of mannose (less than 1 residue/three to four chains). The second fraction contained {{the majority of the}} [3 H]mannose originally in monomer, but no 35 S activity. This fraction appears to contain oligosaccharide-peptides of the asparagine-N-glycosylamine type because there were no reduced sugars present and the alkaline borohydride treatment extensively degraded the core protein. The composition of the oligosaccharides, with high proportions of mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and sialic acid, was consistent with this suggestion. The third fraction consisted of a series of oligosaccharides with sizes between three to six saccharides. They contained N-acetylgalactosaminitol, indicating that they were attached to the core protein by O-glycoside bonds between N-acetylgalactosamine and hydroxyl groups on serine and threonine. Thus, proteoglycans contain two classes of oligosaccharides, a mannose-rich <b>class</b> <b>characteristic</b> of glycoproteins and an O-glycoside <b>class</b> <b>characteristic</b> of mucins, in addition to the chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate chains...|$|E

40|$|The brain {{keeps its}} overall {{dynamics}} in a corridor of intermediate activity {{and it has}} been a long standing question what possible mechanism could achieve this task. Mechanisms from the field of statistical physics have long been suggesting that this homeostasis of brain activity could occur even without a central regulator, via self-organization on the level of neurons and their interactions, alone. Such physical mechanisms from the class of self-organized criticality exhibit characteristic dynamical signatures, similar to seismic activity related to earthquakes. Measurements of cortex rest activity showed first signs of dynamical signatures potentially pointing to self-organized critical dynamics in the brain. Indeed, recent more accurate measurements allowed for a detailed comparison with scaling theory of non-equilibrium critical phenomena, proving the existence of criticality in cortex dynamics. We here compare this new evaluation of cortex activity data to the predictions of the earliest physics spin model of self-organized critical neural networks. We find that the model matches with the recent experimental data and its interpretation in terms of dynamical signatures for criticality in the brain. The combination of signatures for criticality, power law distributions of avalanche sizes and durations, as well as a specific scaling relationship between anomalous exponents, defines a universality <b>class</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the particular critical phenomenon observed in the neural experiments. The spin model is a candidate for a minimal model of a self-organized critical adaptive network for the universality class of neural criticality. As a prototype model, it provides the background for models that include more biological details, yet share the same universality <b>class</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the homeostasis of activity in the brain.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{for analysis of}} structure-activity relationships for sets of active compounds is reported. Molecular similarity relationships are analyzed among compounds with related biological activity based on the evaluation of randomly generated fragment populations. Fragments are randomly generated by iterative bond deletion in molecular graphs and hence depart from thoseobtainedbywell-defined fragmentation schemes [1]. A major finding has been that for any given activity class, dependency relationships of fragment co-occurrence exists within random fragment populations. Through the analysis of these relationships the chemical information content of generated substructures can be quantified [2]. This has lead to the identification of small numbers (10 - 40) of so-called activity <b>class</b> <b>characteristic</b> substructures (ACCS) that have been successfully utilized in virtual screening applications [3, 4].

5|$|Preliminary {{examination}} of the bullet can exclude {{a large number of}} weapons by examining the general characteristics of a recovered bullet. By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number of weapons can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing that type of bullet. The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different <b>class</b> <b>characteristics</b> that are common to specific manufactures. The three main <b>class</b> <b>characteristics</b> of all bullets are the lands and grooves, the caliber of the bullet, and the rifling twist. All three can be tied directly to the type of barrel that was used to fire the bullet. The lands and grooves of barrel are the bumps and valleys created when the rifling is created. The caliber is the diameter of the barrel. The twist is the direction of the striations left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed twist with the exception of weapons created by the Colt's Manufacturing Company which uses left-handed twists. Weapon barrels that match the <b>class</b> <b>characteristics</b> of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual characteristics to determine if the bullet came from that particular weapon.|$|R

In contrast with the standard SVM that finds an optimal boundary separating two classes (discriminating boundary), the OC-SVM finds the boundary enclosing a specific <b>class</b> (<b>characteristic</b> boundary). If the OC-SVM is trained with patterns of healthy control subjects, the distance to the boundary can be interpreted as an abnormality score. This score might allow quantification of symptom severity or provide insights about subgroups of patients.

40|$|In {{underwater}} sensing applications it {{is often}} difficult to train a classifier in advance for all targets that may be seen during testing, due to the large number of targets that may be encountered. We therefore partition the training data into target classes, with each <b>class</b> <b>characteristic</b> of multiple targets that share similar scattering physics. In some cases one may have a priori insight into which targets should constitute a given class, while in other cases this segmentation must be done autonomously based on the scattering data. For the latter case, we constitute the classes using an information-theoretic mapping criterion. Having defined the target classes, the second phase of our identification procedure involves determining those features that enhance the similarity between the targets in a given class. This is achieved by using a GA-based feature selection algorithm, with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) cost function. The classifier employed is appropriate for multi-aspect scattering data and is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM). The performance of the class-based classification algorithm is examined using both measured and computed acoustic scattering data from submerged elastic targets...|$|E
