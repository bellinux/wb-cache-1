50|$|April 13, 2006 - Malley announces {{from the}} speaker's chair {{that he is}} rejoining the {{government}} <b>caucus.</b> <b>Government</b> House Leader Bev Harrison argues that this restores the government majority and that therefore, the Liberals should honour a previous agreement to preserve a working majority on committees of the whole. The Liberals argued that it is improper for a speaker to change his affiliation and refuse to recognize the government as a majority. The legislature becomes somewhat deadlocked as the government controls the primary debate of the chamber, but the opposition controls the votes at committees where legislation and budgetary estimates are approved.|$|E
