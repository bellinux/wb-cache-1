5|$|Other {{apparently}} false <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> that fins prevent {{cancer and}} treat osteoarthritis. No scientific proof supports these claims; {{at least one}} study has shown shark cartilage of no value in cancer treatment.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of {{evolution}} have argued in response that no scientist's <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> treated as sacrosanct, {{as shown by}} the aspects of Darwin's theory that have been rejected or revised by scientists over the years to form first neo-Darwinism and later the modern evolutionary synthesis. The claim that evolution relies on faith is likewise rejected on the grounds that evolution has strong supporting evidence, and therefore does not require faith.|$|E
5|$|However, {{independent}} reviews {{have called}} into question the methodology of those growth estimates, pointing to factual inconsistencies. The event's supposed drawing power outside {{of a handful of}} rugby strongholds was also downplayed significantly, with an estimated 97 percent of the 33 million average audience produced by the 2007 final coming from Australasia, South Africa, the British Isles and France. Other sports have been accused of exaggerating their television reach over the years; such <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> not exclusive to the Rugby World Cup.|$|E
50|$|As of 19 November 2013, 43,068 <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> filed, 11,619 <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> denied, 748 <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> pending and 30,701 were awarded. These numbers did {{not include}} the Marshall Islands.|$|R
50|$|Not {{all these}} defences are {{available}} to all restitutionary claims. The availability of a defence may turn on: whether a restitutionary <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> legal or equitable; whether a <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> for a personal or proprietary remedy; and whether the <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> brought under national or EU law.|$|R
2500|$|In Chapters 7, 12, and 13, {{creditors}} must file a [...] "proof of claim" [...] to get paid. In a Chapter 11 case, a creditor is {{not required}} to file a proof of <b>claim</b> (that <b>is,</b> a proof of <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> [...] "deemed filed") if the creditor's <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> listed on the debtor's bankruptcy schedules, unless the <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> scheduled as [...] "disputed, contingent, or unliquidated."

5|$|Imperator totius orientis (commander-in-chief of {{the entire}} East): only the Augustan History claims that Odaenathus was conferred with this title; the same source also claims that he was made an Augustus (co-emperor) {{following}} his defeat of the Persians. Both <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> dismissed by scholars. Odaenathus {{seems to have been}} acclaimed as Imperator by his troops which is a salutation reserved for the Roman emperor; this acclamation might explain the erroneous reports of the Augustan History.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{there have been}} moves towards greater {{modernisation}} and standardisation, with large purchases of new rolling stock from companies like Alstom and China CNR Corporation, as well as smaller orders of second hand rolling stock, which {{the government of the}} City of Buenos Aires <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> temporary measures while those lines are modernised to be able to incorporate more modern rolling stock. Such stock has been acquired from Tokyo, Nagoya, and Madrid. From 2013 to 2019, 468 new cars are set to arrive while 232 are receiving refurbishment, bringing {{the average age of the}} fleet to 22 years in 2016, down from 34 in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an {{important}} contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our political and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it remains on the periphery of mainstream dialogue in political theory. He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E
25|$|However, Nayachandra's <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> not {{supported}} by any other literary or epigraphic evidence. Therefore, the historical accuracy of this <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> doubtful.|$|R
50|$|Pyrrhonian moral {{skepticism}} {{holds that}} the reason we are unjustified in believing any moral <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> that it is irrational for us to believe either that any moral <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> true or that any moral <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> false. Thus, {{in addition to being}} agnostic on whether (i) is true, Pyrrhonian moral skepticism denies (ii).|$|R

5|$|Recent {{literature}} exploring bioethical {{questions from}} a human rights perspective has been criticised {{on the grounds that}} human rights theory contains unresolved problems. Bioethicists have claimed that bioethical inquiry can contribute to resolving these problems. Cochrane claims that this contribution to human rights literature offers three insights, but that these are not entirely original. These insights are questions about institutional fairness, rights as trumps and rights as solely belonging to humans. Cochrane holds that human rights should be reconceptualised as sentient rights. The grounding of human rights, he <b>claims,</b> <b>are</b> not distinct from the grounding of human obligations to nonhuman animals, and attempts to distinguish human rights from the rights of other sentient beings ultimately fail.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} into Pattle's claims {{has shown that}} at least 27 claimed victories can be directly linked to specific Italian and German losses, while only six <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> discounted as no Axis losses are recorded. Other research dedicated {{to the history of}} German bomber units, some of which took part in the air battles against Pattle's unit, have drawn {{attention to the fact that}} 97–98 percent of all German primary records belonging to the Luftwaffe have been lost either through Allied bombing or through Hermann Göring's order to destroy all records in the first week of May 1945. This makes any {{research into}} German losses difficult.|$|E
5|$|The Apple A5 chip doubles {{processing}} speed and has graphics processing {{that is up}} to nine {{times faster than the}} previous iPad. However, benchtests and hardware assessments performed by various third party news sources and technology blogs indicate that those <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> exaggerated; the benchmark assessment conducted by Anandtech showed that the GPU of the iPad 2 is only 3 times faster than that of the original iPad. CPU benchmarks conducted on the iPad 2 by iOSnoops indicate a 66% performance increase compared to the original iPad.|$|E

2500|$|Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee echoed {{that fewer}} <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> {{expected}} through the EQC than for 2010. In the 2010 earthquake, 180,000 <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> processed {{as opposed to}} the expected 130,000 claims for the 2011 aftershock. The total number of claims for the two events was expected to be 250,000, as Brownlee explained that many of the <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> [...] "overlapping".|$|R
5|$|The {{land border}} {{disputes}} pertain to comparatively small strips of land. The Croatia–Slovenia border disputes are: along the Dragonja River's lower course where Slovenia claims three hamlets on the river's left bank; the Sveta Gera peak of Žumberak where exact territorial claims were never made {{and appear to}} be limited to a military barracks on the peak itself; and along the Mura River where Slovenia wants the border to be along the current river bed instead of along a former one and claims a (largely if not completely uninhabited) piece of land near Hotiza. These <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> likewise {{in the process of being}} settled by binding arbitration.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{accounts of}} the life of Joan of Arc have been challenged by revisionist authors. Claims made by such authors include: that Joan of Arc was not actually burned at the stake; that she was secretly the half sister of King Charles VII; that she was not a true Christian but a member of a pagan cult; and that most of the story of Joan of Arc is actually a myth. None of these <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> widely accepted by historians.|$|E
5|$|The {{uncritical}} {{acceptance of}} Price's reports prompted a formal {{study by the}} Society for Psychical Research (SPR), which rejected most of the sightings as either imagined or fabricated and cast doubt on Price's credibility. His <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> now generally discredited by ghost historians. Neither the SPR's report nor the more recent biography of Price has quelled public interest in these stories, and new books and television documentaries continue to satisfy public fascination with the rectory.|$|E

50|$|To date no land <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> {{settled in}} the area. Due to the {{uncertainty}} around the land <b>claims</b> the suburb <b>is</b> {{in a state of}} gross neglect. The settling of land <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> complicated further by the number of claims lodged. The problem is that there <b>are</b> more <b>claims</b> than there <b>are</b> properties in the area.|$|R
5|$|After the war, the bad {{conditions}} and high casualties amongst the Anzac troops {{resulted in a}} reasonably prevalent view in Australia that these had been due to the incompetence of British officers commanding the Australian troops and their disregard for the casualties that resulted from poorly planned or ill-conceived attacks. Whether these <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> valid or not, {{there can be little}} doubt that the entire campaign was poorly conducted, and as a result there were many military lessons learnt that were to be applied in later campaigns. Despite this, for Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign has come to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity. Today, the date of the initial landings, 25 April, is a public holiday known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations, and indeed in Turkey, to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original Anzacs, and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war.|$|E
5|$|Having {{identified}} the culprit as Adachi, the party chases and locates him within the TV world. Adachi explains that his actions {{were out of}} both boredom {{and the belief that}} humanity is better off believing what it wants; his <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> dismissed by the party as the rantings of a madman. After fighting Adachi, he is possessed by Ameno-sagiri, the Japanese God of Fog, who reveals that the fog is harmful to people and will eventually cause humanity to fall into a permanent state of ignorance and transform into Shadows. Upon his defeat, he agrees to lift the fog, congratulating the party on their resolve. Defeated, the wounded Adachi agrees to assume responsibility for his actions and turns himself in. The game moves forward to the day before the protagonist must travel home. If the player returns to the Dojima residence, the game ends with the party sending the protagonist off as he departs Inaba. Alternatively, should the player be able to identify the unexplained cause of the Midnight Channel and attempt to resolve this plot element, the protagonist meets with the party, and together they decide to end the case for good.|$|E
5|$|Malmö FF {{made the}} {{transition}} from amateurism to full professionalism in the late 1970s {{under the leadership of}} club chairman Eric Persson. An open member association, the club's annual general meeting is the highest policy-making body. Each club member has one vote, so no shares are issued. The general meeting approves the accounts, votes to elect the chairman and other board members, and decides on incoming motions. The current chairman is Håkan Jeppsson, who has been chairman since 2010, when he replaced Bengt Madsen. The club's legal status means that any interest <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> made to the club, and not {{to the board of directors}} or club members.

5|$|Mostow, an {{immigrant}} from Uzbekistan {{with a history}} of involuntary commitment, is charged with killing seven men by mutilating their faces. Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) become involved in the investigation when Mostow insists that he was possessed during the killings; his <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> given credence when another murder occurs after his arrest. Mostow draws a gargoyle and claims it made him kill. The agents meet with Patterson who has spent three years on the case. Mulder knows Patterson from his time in the Investigative Support Unit at Quantico. Their relationship is tense, and Patterson is skeptical of Mulder's theories. Mulder and Scully go to Mostow's studio and discover a hidden room full of gargoyle sculptures, finding corpses within them.|$|E
5|$|Support for Liddell's story {{came from}} Cecil Williamson, {{founder of the}} Museum of Witchcraft, {{who claimed to have}} known about Pickingill through his acquaintances with both Crowley and Gardner. However, Williamson was an {{unreliable}} source, and was known to repeatedly fabricate claims regarding past events. Another figure, known only as Colonel Lawrence, also supported Liddell's story, asserting that his own great-grandmother had studied under Pickingill and thus had been introduced to Crowley; as with Williamson's, however, Lawrence's <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> unreliable, particularly as he has made the unsupported claim that his great-grandmother studied witchcraft under the American folklorist Charles Leland. Also supporting Liddell's claims was the Wiccan Ralph Harvey, who, following the publication of Liddell's material, publicly declared that in the 1950s or 1960s he had been initiated into one of Pickingill's Nine Covens, located in Storrington, Sussex. Following the publication of Liddell's claims, a number of covens appeared in both the United States and Australia claiming to be practitioners of a tradition originating with Pickingill. Liddell himself has been critical of such groups, expressing his regret that the material he published led to their formation.|$|E
