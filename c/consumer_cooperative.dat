2500|$|Once released, in January 1899 he {{established}} a <b>consumer</b> <b>cooperative</b> in Corleone involving some 800 heads of households that could buy basic necessities {{at a much lower}} price. In 1899, he also founded the [...] "Zuccarrone Agricultural Brotherhood" [...] (Fratellanza agricola Zuccarrone) to directly manage the 485 lots for the peasants of the Zuccarrone estate. The idea was to replace the old model of a single lease holder (a gabelloto, often a Mafia boss) with a [...] "collective lease holder" [...] through a peasant cooperative.|$|E

But in September, the federation was dissolved by the prefect, because it was considered to be a surreptitious way to revive the Fasci. Verro was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and fined 100,000 lire for unlawful association. Convinced that in Sicily there was little space for political action, he decided to emigrate to the United States, to propagate socialism overseas. He only stayed two years and in the spring of 1898 he returned to Sicily, where he had to serve the six months in jail to which he had been sentenced.|$|E

50|$|Cooperative {{societies}} in Japan were initiated during {{the era of}} Taisho democracy. In 1900, the Industrial Association Law was enacted and under its provisions consumer cooperatives like Nada <b>Consumer</b> <b>Cooperative</b> and Kobe <b>Consumer</b> <b>Cooperative</b> were formed. During the Showa period, cooperative movements {{came to a halt}} due to the increase economic control of the government and the compulsory military drafts for war. At the end of WWII in 1945, severe food shortages and inflation stimulated the growth and expansion of cooperatives once again. In 1948, the <b>Consumer</b> <b>Cooperative</b> Law replaced the Industrial Association Law of 1900 which provided limitations on the operation of <b>consumer</b> <b>cooperative</b> societies within prefectures and prevented the merger of cooperatives across prefecture borders. In 1951, Toyohiko Kagawa founded the Japanese Consumers’ Cooperative Union, or JCCU, which was established to represent and serve all the consumers’ cooperative societies of Japan.|$|E
40|$|Issue of my Masters work {{inclusive}} of questions <b>consumers</b> <b>cooperative</b> and network marketing. This {{is very interesting}} and actual section, because both of these levels have been hiding large potential. They can bring out compelling alternative solution in contact with final consumer. The Work is focused on general analysis of the setting of network marketing and the setting of <b>consumers</b> <b>cooperative</b> in the Czech republic. This analysis is completed with comparison of two concrete subjects and assets for final consumers. One of the components is also question form. This question form is based on questioning of two hundreds respondents. Main aims were to find out consumers view of network marketing and <b>consumers</b> <b>cooperative,</b> how <b>consumers</b> trust these systems and how often they use it for shopping. Conclusion what I got from research is that <b>consumers</b> <b>cooperative</b> is more popular, than network marketing. Due to wrong name of network marketing. That is also why the final <b>consumer</b> use <b>consumers</b> <b>cooperative</b> more often for shopping, than network marketing. Main potential of <b>consumers</b> <b>cooperative</b> and network marketing {{is based on the}} fact, that they can get final consumers to integrate chain. In that case, the consumer is supposed to participate in the co-creation of products and services...|$|R

40|$|<b>Consumer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> {{constitute}} {{a highly successful}} example of democratic forms of enterprises operating in developed countries. They are usually organized as medium and large-scale ?rms competing with pro?t-maximizing ?rms in retail industries. This paper models such situation as a mixed oligopoly in which <b>consumer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> maximize the utility of consumer-members and distribute them {{a share of the}} pro?t equal to the ratio of their individual expenditure to the ?rm total sales. We show that when consumers possess quasilinear preferences over a bundle of symmetrically di¤erentiated goods and ?rms operate with a linear technology, the presence of <b>consumer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> a¤ects all industries output and social welfare positively. The e¤ect of cooperatives on welfare proves more signi?cant when goods are either complements or highly di¤erentiated and when competition is à la Cournot rather than à la Bertrand. <b>Consumer</b> <b>Cooperatives,</b> Pro?t-maximizing Firms, Mixed Oligopoly...|$|R

50|$|<b>Consumer</b> <b>{{cooperative}}s</b> {{utilize the}} cooperative principle of democratic member control, or one member/one vote. Most <b>consumer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> have {{a board of}} directors elected by and from the membership. The board is usually responsible for hiring management and ensuring that the cooperative meets its goals, both financial and otherwise. Democratic functions, such as petitioning or recall of board members, may be codified in the bylaws or organizing document of the <b>cooperative.</b> Most <b>consumer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> hold regular membership meetings (often once a year). As mutually owned businesses, each member of a society has a shareholding equal to the sum they paid in when they joined.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{globalization}} of world economies {{has led the}} retail markets of developed countries towards increasing levels of integration and strategic interdependence. A non negligible share of retail and food markets is currently served by co-operative societies. Consistently with this trend, the <b>consumer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> have recently experienced increasing levels of integration. The main aim {{of this paper is}} to study the welfare effects of coordination among <b>consumer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> competing in quantities in a mixed oligopoly against profit-maximizing firms. We show that, in absence of agency problems, under increasing or constant returns to scale a higher output coordination of the <b>consumer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> does not affect the total welfare as long as a nonnegative profit constraint holds in these firms. On the other hand, under decreasing returns to scale, the <b>consumer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> contribute more to social welfare when acting on behalf of all consumers. This is because, by coordinating consumers’ preferences, these firms can reduce their market output, thus helping the market to come closer to the first best. All together these results seem to provide an argument in favour of the recent process of integration involving <b>consumer</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in many developed countries...|$|R
