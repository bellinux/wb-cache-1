50|$|Cycling UK {{believes}} that UK cyclists {{should continue to}} be free {{to decide whether or not}} they wear <b>cycle</b> <b>helmets,</b> and campaigns to keep the UK's laws as they are. Cycling UK says that this is because putting too much emphasis on <b>cycle</b> <b>helmets</b> makes people think that cycling is much more dangerous than it actually is, and can put people off. Cycling UK {{believes that}} health benefits of cycling far outweigh the risks, so it is important that people are not discouraged. Cycling UK also feels that the real risks faced by cyclists, such as excessive vehicle speed, are often forgotten when all the discussions concentrate on <b>cycle</b> <b>helmets.</b> Cycling UK reviewed the current Highway Code before it was published, and helped reword some sections that could have been detrimental for cyclists.|$|R

2500|$|On 20 July 2010, Cracknell {{suffered}} a hit from behind by a petrol tanker whilst cycling during {{an attempt to}} cycle, row, run and swim from Los Angeles to New York within 18 days. The accident happened at around 5.30am on a quiet stretch of road outside Winslow, Arizona.

In the crash he {{suffered a}} contrecoup injury to the frontal lobes of his brain. He is now back at home with his family, although his recovery may never be complete. In 2012 Cracknell and his wife wrote Touching Distance about his life before and after his brain injury, which has left him with epilepsy and a changed personality, including a short temper. Since the accident he has been conspicuous in advocating the use of bicycle helmets.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the selling of <b>cycle</b> <b>helmets</b> in retail stores with {{particular}} reference to the adequacy of advice offered about the fit and securing of helmets. METHODS: All 55 retail outlets selling <b>cycle</b> <b>helmets</b> in Christchurch, New Zealand were studied by participant observation. A research entered each store as a prospective customer and requested assistance to purchase a helmet. She took detailed field notes of the ensuing encounter and these were subsequently transcribed, coded, and analysed. RESULTS: Adequate advice for helmet purchase was given in less than half of the stores. In general the sales assistants in specialist cycle shops were better informed and gave more adequate advice than those in department stores. Those who have good advice also tended to be more good advice also tended to be more active in helping with fitting the helmet. Knowledge about safety standards was apparent in one third of sales assistants. Few stores displayed information for customers about the correct fit of <b>cycle</b> <b>helmets.</b> CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the advice and assistance being given to ensure that <b>cycle</b> <b>helmets</b> fit properly is often inadequate and thus the helmets may fail to fulfil their purpose in preventing injury. Consultation between retailers and policy makers is a necessary first step to improving this situation...|$|R

2500|$|A <b>cycle</b> <b>helmet</b> should {{generally}} be light in weight and provide ample ventilation because cycling {{can be an}} intense aerobic activity which significantly raises body temperature, and the head in particular {{needs to be able}} to regulate its temperature. The dominant form of the helmet up to the 1970s was the leather [...] "hairnet" [...] style. This offered acceptable protection from scrapes and cuts, but only minimal impact protection, and was mainly used by racing cyclists. More widespread use of helmets began in the U.S. in the 1970s. After many decades, when bicycles were regarded only as children's toys, many American adults took up cycling during and after the bike boom of the 1970s. Two of the first modern bicycle helmets were made by MSR, a manufacturer of mountaineering equipment, and Bell Sports, a manufacturer of helmets for auto racing and motorcycles. These helmets were a spin-off from the development of expanded polystyrene foam liners for motorcycling and motorsport helmets and had hard polycarbonate plastic shells. The bicycle helmet arm of Bell was split off in 1991 as Bell Sports Inc., having completely overtaken the motorcycle and motorsports helmet business.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{a causal}} link is not proven, it is {{observed}} that the countries with the best cycle safety records (Denmark and the Netherlands) have among the lowest levels of helmet use.. Their bicycle safety record is generally attributed to public awareness and understanding of cyclists, safety in numbers, education, and cycling infrastructure. A study of cycling in major streets of Boston, Paris and Amsterdam illustrates the variation in cycling culture: Boston had far higher rates of helmet-wearing (32% of cyclists, versus 2.4% in Paris and 0.1% in Amsterdam), Amsterdam had far more cyclists (242 passing bicycles per hour, versus 74 in Paris and 55 in Boston). <b>Cycle</b> <b>helmet</b> wearing rates in the Netherlands and Denmark are very low. An Australian journalist writes: [...] "Rarities in Amsterdam seem to be stretch-fabric-clad cyclists and fat cyclists. Helmets are non-existent, and when people asked me where I was from, they would grimace and mutter: [...] "Ah, yes, helmet laws." [...] These had gained international notoriety on a par with our deadly sea animals. Despite the lack of helmets, cycling in the Netherlands is safer than in any other country, and the Dutch have one-third the number of cycling fatalities (per 100,000 people) that Australia has." [...] Cycling UK say that cycling in the Netherlands and Denmark is perceived as a [...] "normal" [...] activity requiring no special clothing or equipment. Pucher and Buehler state: [...] "The Dutch cycling experts and planners interviewed for this paper adamantly opposed the use of helmets, claiming that helmets discourage cycling by making it less convenient, less comfortable, and less fashionable. They also mention the possibility that helmets would make cycling more dangerous by giving cyclists a false sense of safety and thus encouraging riskier riding behavior." ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} if {{attendance at}} Lifeskills, a safety education centre {{for children in}} Year 6 (10 – 11 years), is associated with engagement in safer behaviours, and with fewer accidents and injuries, in adolescence. Methods: The sample are participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children who attended school in the Lifeskills catchment area in Year 6; 60 % attended Lifeskills. At 14 – 15 years, participants (n approximately 3000, varies by outcome) self-reported road safety behaviours and accidents, and perceived health effects and use of alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco. Additional outcomes from linkage to Hospital Episodes Statistics were available for a sub-sample (n = 1768) : hospital admittance (for accident-related reason, from 11 – 16 years) and A&E attendance (for any reason, from approximately 14 – 16 years). Results: Children who attended Lifeskills {{were more likely to}} report using pedestrian crossings on their way to school than children who did not attend (59 % versus 52 %). Lifeskills attendance was unrelated to the ownership of <b>cycle</b> <b>helmets,</b> or the use of <b>cycle</b> <b>helmets,</b> seat belts, or reflective/fluorescent clothing, or to A&E attendance. Use of <b>cycle</b> <b>helmets</b> (37 %) and reflective/fluorescent clothing (< 4 %) on last cycle was low irrespective of Lifeskills attendance. Lifeskills attendance was associated with less reported smoking and cannabis use, but was generally unrelated to perceptions of the health impact of substance use. Conclusions: Lifeskills attendance was associated with some safer behaviours in adolescence. The overall low use of <b>cycle</b> <b>helmets</b> and reflective/fluorescent clothing evidences the need for powerful promotion of some safer behaviours at Lifeskills and at follow-up in schools...|$|R
