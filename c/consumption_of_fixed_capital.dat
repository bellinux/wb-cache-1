40|$|Our {{country will}} enter the 1980 s with a mighty {{economic}} and scientific-technical potential.

At the beginning <b>of</b> 1980 <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> amounted to 1. 6 trillion rubles, i. e., it increased by 1 trillion rubles compared with 1965. This increment was almost two times greater than the value <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> created in the first half-century of socialist construction. Out of the total volume <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital,</b> productive <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> comprised 1. 1 trillion rubles. In the last ten years productive <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> doubled. The constant renovation <b>of</b> existing <b>fixed</b> productive <b>capital</b> {{is one of the most}} important directions of investment policy. ...|$|R
50|$|Land {{itself is}} not {{included}} in the statistical concept <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital,</b> even though it is a fixed asset. The main reason is that land is not regarded as a product (a reproducible good). But the value of land improvements is included in the statistical concept <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital,</b> being regarded as the creation of value-added through production.|$|R

5000|$|There exists {{nowadays}} a large {{market in}} second-hand (used) assets. In principle, statistical measures <b>of</b> gross <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> formation {{are supposed to}} refer to the net additions <b>of</b> newly produced <b>fixed</b> assets, which enlarge the total stock <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> in the economy. But if a substantial trade occurs in fixed assets resold from one enterprise or one country to another, it may become difficult to know what the real net addition to the stock <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> <b>of</b> a country actually is. A precise distinction between [...] "new" [...] and [...] "used" [...] assets becomes more difficult to draw. How to value used assets and their depreciation consistently becomes more problematic.|$|R

"Consumption {{of fixed}} capital is the decline, {{during the course}} of the {{accounting}} period, in the current value of the stock of fixed assets owned and used by a producer as a result of physical deterioration, normal obsolescence or normal accidental damage. The term depreciation is often used in place of <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> but it is avoided in the SNA because in commercial accounting the term depreciation is often used in the context of writing off historic costs whereas in the SNA <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> is dependent on the current value of the asset."

50|$|Of course, {{in reality}} {{it could be that}} real ("economic") {{depreciation}} diverges from depreciation for tax purposes. In that case, the reported <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> could contain an element of undistributed profit. Additionally, official national accounts may include in <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> the value of those insurance premiums, interest and rents paid from gross income, which relate directly to the acquisition or maintenance of productive fixed assets, on the ground that {{they are part of the}} cost of operating productive fixed assets. In Marxian economics, however, these flows would be regarded either as a faux frais of production, a circulating constant capital outlay, or an element of gross surplus value.|$|E
50|$|During an {{accounting}} period, additions {{may be made}} to capital assets (including those that disproportionately increase {{the value of the}} capital stock) and capital assets are also disposed of; at the same time, physical assets also incur depreciation or <b>Consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital.</b> Also, price inflation may affect the value of the capital stock.|$|E

5000|$|In principle, CFC is {{calculated}} using the actual or estimated prices and rentals {{of fixed assets}} prevailing {{at the time the}} production takes place, and not at the times fixed assets were originally acquired.

50|$|The {{equation}} of new value added with net output or GDP (also known as gross value added) {{would have made}} no sense to Marx, mainly because net output includes depreciation (or the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital),</b> yet excludes various property rents paid by producing enterprises from their gross income (on the ground that renting out an asset does not itself constitute production) as well as a portion of net interest (regarded as property income).|$|E
50|$|In {{national}} accounts {{such as the}} United Nations System of National Accounts (UNSNA) or the United States National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA), gross value added is obtained by deducting intermediate consumption from gross output. Thus gross value added is equal to net output. Net value added is obtained by deducting <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>capital</b> (or depreciation charges) from gross value added. Net value added therefore equals gross wages, pre-tax profits net of depreciation, and indirect taxes less subsidies.|$|E

Fixed assets depreciate in value over time, due to wear and tear and market obsolescence.
