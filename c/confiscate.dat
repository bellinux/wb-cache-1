50|$|On 17 February 2017, a {{day before}} World Pangolin Day, {{officials}} in Cameroon burned 3 tonnes of <b>confiscated</b> pangolin scales, representing up to 10,000 animals. The Cameroonian government had <b>confiscated</b> more than 8 tonnes of pangolin scales since 2013. This conservation strategy {{is similar to the}} increasingly common destroying <b>confiscated</b> ivory to deter poaching and generate public outrage or action. As with ivory, there is an opportunity cost to destroying the material, trading awareness via public spectacle for the money which could be gained by reselling what was <b>confiscated.</b>|$|R
5|$|In June 1903, the Russian {{government}} {{issued an}} edict {{to close down}} Armenian schools and <b>confiscate</b> {{the properties of the}} Armenian Church, including the treasures of Etchmiadzin.

5|$|The {{body was}} re-cremated during the funeral, but Đức's heart {{remained}} intact {{and did not}} burn. It {{was considered to be}} holy and placed in a glass chalice at Xá Lợi Pagoda. The intact heart relic is regarded as a symbol of compassion. Đức has subsequently been revered by Vietnamese Buddhists as a bodhisattva (Bồ Tát), and accordingly is often referred to in Vietnamese as Bồ Tát Thích Quảng Đức. On 21 August, the ARVN Special Forces of Nhu attacked Xá Lợi and other Buddhist pagodas across Vietnam. The secret police intended to <b>confiscate</b> Đức's ashes, but two monks had escaped with the urn, jumping over the back fence and finding safety at the U.S. Operations Mission next door. Nhu's men managed to <b>confiscate</b> Đức's charred heart.|$|E
5000|$|When <b>confiscating</b> {{property}} {{involved in}} criminal case from an unknown owner, the property <b>confiscated</b> {{will remain the}} property of the unknown owner pending a trial and a court decision to transfer the property <b>confiscated</b> to the state. An example could arise where the property to be <b>confiscated</b> might endanger people, property or society, or might be used for commission of a felony. Typically, this concerns prohibited weapons or ammunition, explosives, narcotics, poisons, etc., seized by the police without, {{at the time of the}} seizure, knowing the owner's identity.|$|R

5|$|This, in turn, {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of even greater excesses; to pay the Spartan garrison's wages, Critias and the leaders ordered each of the Thirty to arrest and execute a metic, or resident alien, and <b>confiscate</b> his property. Theramenes, protesting that this action was worse than the worst excesses of the democracy, refused to follow the order.|$|E
5|$|A {{battle of}} wits ensues between Waggett, {{who wants to}} <b>confiscate</b> the {{salvaged}} cargo, and the islanders. Waggett brings in Macroon's old Customs and Excise nemesis, Mr. Farquharson, and his men {{to search for the}} whisky, but the forewarned islanders manage to hide the bottles in various ingenious places, including ammunition cases which Waggett ships off-island. When this is discovered, Waggett is recalled to the mainland to explain himself, leaving the locals triumphant.|$|E

By March 1862, to Stevens's exasperation, the most Lincoln had publicly supported was gradual emancipation in the Border states, with the masters compensated by the federal government.|$|E
5000|$|The act {{sought to}} redress the {{improper}} confiscation of Maori {{lands in the}} Waikato district under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 in or about 1864 and 1865.

In response to claims that lands had been improperly <b>confiscated</b> or that excessive quantities had been <b>confiscated,</b> a commission of inquiry (the [...] "Sim Commission") was appointed in 1926. The commission's report recommended that the members of the tribes in the Waikato district whose lands had been <b>confiscated</b> should be compensated by an annual payment. The act established the Tainui Maori Trust Fund, which would receive the payments, and the Tainui Maori Trust Board, which would administer the fund {{for the benefit of the}} members of the [...] "Tainui tribes" [...] who had owned the <b>confiscated</b> lands in the [...] "Waikato district".|$|R

The Committee faltered in creating procedures for their enforcement, and the frantic pace of unfolding political events left them behind.|$|E

However, it still refused to reinstate him or compensate him for the loss of his career and pension. Since 2009, Tomlinson can now travel freely to the UK.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces sent {{to disarm}} the Japanese and {{repatriate}} {{prisoners of war}} arrived in Indonesia in September 1945. In Semarang, {{this led to a}} conflict between Japanese forces and Indonesian rebels, that began on 15October; the Indonesians aimed to <b>confiscate</b> the Japanese weapons. Allied forces began landing in the city on 20October 1945; a small group was sent to Gedangan to speak with Soegijapranata. Concerned with civilian suffering, the vicar apostolic told the Allies that they must stop the battle; the Allies could not comply as they did not know the Japanese commander. Soegijapranata then contacted the Japanese and, that afternoon, brokered a cease-fire agreement in his office at Gedangan, despite Indonesian forces' firing at the Gurkha soldiers posted in front of the building.|$|E
5|$|Contemporaries {{regarded}} Organt {{as something}} of a salacious novelty and it was quickly banned, but censors who tried to <b>confiscate</b> it discovered that few copies were available anywhere. It did not sell well and resulted in a financial loss for its author. The public's taste for literature had changed in the prelude to the Revolution, and Saint-Just's taste changed with it: aside from a few pages of an unfinished novel found amidst his papers {{at the end of his}} life, Saint-Just devoted his future writing entirely to undecorated essays of social and political theory. With his previous ambitions of literary and lawyerly fame unfulfilled, Saint-Just directed his focus on the single goal of revolutionary command.|$|E
