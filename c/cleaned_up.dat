5000|$|The {{success of}} the first <b>Clean</b> <b>Up</b> event in 1989 sparked {{national}} interest in the simple but effective community-based idea. In 1990, the first <b>Clean</b> <b>Up</b> Australia Day took place on Sunday, 21 January. Again, the response of Australians was astounding. More than 300,000 Australians volunteered their time to help {{make a difference to}} the health of their local environment. Since then more than 7 million people have heeded the call through annual <b>Clean</b> <b>Up</b> Australia Days, Friday Schools <b>Clean</b> <b>Up</b> Days and Business <b>Clean</b> <b>Ups.</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>up</b> Australia's Mission is [...] "To inspire and work with communities to <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> and fix up our Earth".

5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered {{by the fact that}} most of the original debris from Iowa had been <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> or otherwise disposed of by the Navy before and after the first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather than an intentional act of sabotage.|$|E

5|$|Days {{after the}} spill, tar balls began washing ashore on beaches {{down the coast}} in nearby Summerland and then farther down the coast in Ventura county.

5|$|Nazi Germany had {{a strong}} anti-tobacco {{movement}} as pioneering research by Franz H. MÃ¼ller in 1939 demonstrated a causal link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer. The Reich Health Office took measures to try to limit smoking, including producing lectures and pamphlets. Smoking was banned in many workplaces, on trains and among on-duty members of the military. Government agencies also worked to control other carcinogenic substances such as asbestos and pesticides. As {{part of a general}} public health campaign, water supplies were <b>cleaned</b> <b>up,</b> lead and mercury were removed from consumer products and women were urged to undergo regular screenings for breast cancer.|$|E

5|$|Westchester's postwar {{development}} {{led to more}} stormwater runoff, {{which often}} flooded and closed the parkway. By 1958, engineers were urging that the river be <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> to reduce flooding. Still, illegal dumping and overflows continued. For example, storm runoff gave the Yonkers section the river's highest concentrations of heavy metals, PCBs, and other chemicals, {{according to a study}} of the river in 1983, the year the city stopped using the Saw Mill as its primary water source. A decade later, the sediment in the Saw Mill had the highest concentration of metals in the United States Geological Survey's entire water-quality assessment program.|$|E
5|$|Curtiss-Wright left in 1960, {{after which}} a {{succession}} of tenants further contaminated the nuclear reactor facility and its hot cells with radioactive isotopes, including strontium-90 and cobalt-60. The manufacture of radiation-treated hardwood flooring continued until 2002. Pennsylvania reacquired the land in 1963 and 1967, and in 1965 established Quehanna as a wild area, albeit one with a nuclear facility and industrial complex. The cleanup of the reactor and hot cells took over eight years and cost $30million; the facility was demolished and its nuclear license terminated in 2009. Since 1992 the industrial complex has been home to Quehanna Motivational Boot Camp, a minimum-security prison. Quehanna Wild Area has many sites where radioactive and toxic waste was buried, {{some of which have}} been <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> while others were dug up by black bears and white-tailed deer.|$|E

5|$|In early 1977, TSR {{created the}} first element of a two-pronged {{strategy}} that would divide D for nearly two decades. A Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set boxed edition was introduced that <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> {{the presentation of the}} essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores. Later in 1977, the first part of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD) was published, which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the Basic Set directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.|$|E
5|$|Kurt Busch and Montoya {{moved into}} fourth and ninth {{positions}} respectively on lap 141. By the 150th lap, Johnson {{had built up}} a 2.7 second lead over Hamlin. On lap 162, Johnson's lead of 3.4 seconds was reduced to nothing when debris was spotted on the track, causing a caution. During the caution, some of the leaders elected to make pit stops. Johnson remained the leader on the restart, ahead of Bowyer and Hamlin. Two laps later, a multi-car collision occurred on the front straightway as Earnhardt lost control of his car, and collected Logano, Scott Speed, Hornish, Bobby Labonte, Kenseth, Stewart, Vickers and Keselowski. The damaged cars headed to the pit road during the caution as crews <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> debris.|$|E

Darren forces Nicky out of his room, and is then attacked by the Boogeyman, who disembowels him and removes his heart.|$|E
40|$|Abstract <b>Clean</b> <b>up</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} steps to remove co-extractives and undesired interfering substances from the sample before analysis in pesticide residue analysis. Some advanced, sophisticated and efficient methods of <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> have emerged out which is able to save time as well as amount of solvents. These are Solid Phase Extraction (SPE), Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) and Supercritical Fluid Chromatography (SFC). They are very much efficient for <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> and extraction of pesticide samples. SPE method is successfully used for <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> of pesticide residue from soil and water samples. GPC is now widely used in sample preparation in many residue laboratories and is effectively used for multi-residue analysis. SFC is by far the best method of <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> and extraction, though it involves high cost. Thus, various suitable <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> methods can free pesticide residues from extraneous co-extractive materials in an efficient manner and helps to prepare a good sample for further analysis...|$|R

He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match on}} the card was a Straight Edge Society pledge vs. hair match, between CM Punk and Rey Mysterio. For this match, the other Straight Edge Society members (Serena and Luke Gallows) were banned from ringside. Early on in the match, Punk threw Mysterio headfirst {{out of the ring}} into the barber chair at ringside. Punk had {{suffered}} a cut to the head prior to the exchange, and while Mysterio was on the floor, the match was halted so that the blood could be <b>cleaned</b> <b>up.</b> While Punk's wound was being attended, he dropkicked Mysterio, who was on the ring apron, and began attacking him on the floor to restart the match. After Mysterio missed a splash from the top rope, Punk went to pin him, but Mysterio was able to perform a crucifix cradle on Punk for the victory. The other Straight Edge Society members attacked Mysterio after the match, but he was saved by Kane, which allowed Mysterio to handcuff Punk to the ring ropes and shave his head.|$|E
5|$|The tomb of Archimedes {{carried a}} {{sculpture}} illustrating his favorite mathematical proof, {{consisting of a}} sphere and a cylinder of the same height and diameter. Archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases. In 75BC, 137 years after his death, the Roman orator Cicero was serving as quaestor in Sicily. He had heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes, {{but none of the}} locals were able to give him the location. Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb <b>cleaned</b> <b>up,</b> and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription. A tomb discovered in the courtyard of the Hotel Panorama in Syracuse in the early 1960s was claimed to be that of Archimedes, but there was no compelling evidence for this and the location of his tomb today is unknown.|$|E
