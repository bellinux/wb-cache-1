40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} strongly {{indicates that}} human exploitation has frequently led to rapid evolutionary changes in wild populations, yet the mechanisms involved are often poorly understood. Here, we applied a recently developed demographic framework for analyzing selection {{to data from}} a 20 -year study of a wild population of moose, Alces alces. In this population, a genetic pedigree has been established {{all the way back}} to founders. We demonstrate harvest-induced directional selection for delayed birth dates in males and reduced body mass as calf in females. During the study period, birth date was delayed by 0. 81 days per year for both sexes, whereas no significant changes occurred in calf body mass. Quantitative genetic analyses indicated that both traits harbored significant additive genetic variance. These results show that selective harvesting can induce strong selection that oppose natural selection. This may cause evolution of less favorable phenotypes that become maladaptive once harvesting <b>ceases.</b> <b>Age</b> structure, animal model, microevolution, reproductive value, ungulat...|$|R

5000|$|Judge and Daniels' reduced {{involvement}} with the show resulted in the series' format turning more episodic and formulaic. Beginning in season seven, John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky, who had worked on the series since season two, took it over completely, tending to emphasize Judge's concept that the series was built around sociopolitical humor rather than character-driven humor. Although Fox insisted that the series lack character development or story arcs (a demand made of the network's other animated series, {{so that they can}} be shown out of order in syndication), Judge and Daniels had managed to develop several minor arcs and story elements throughout the early years of the series, such as Luanne's becoming more independent and educated after Buckley's death, and the aging of characters being acknowledged (a rare narrative occurrence for an animated series). Lacking Judge and Daniels' supervision, the series <b>ceased</b> <b>aging</b> its characters and even began retconning character backstories; in the episode [...] "A Rover Runs Through It", Peggy's mother was abruptly changed from a neurotic housewife with whom Peggy shared a competitive relationship to a bitter rancher from whom Peggy had been estranged for several years. The format change also resulted in at least one minor character—Laoma, Khan's mother—being written out of the show completely, and her relationship with Bill ignored in all future episodes.|$|R

The average male Olympian possesses sufficient superhuman strength to lift about 30 tons while the average Olympian female can lift about 25 tons. Several Olympians exceed these averages by a considerable degree due to naturally possessing greater physical strength, though some can augment their strength further by magical means.|$|R

40|$|Like {{many other}} countries, {{including}} the United States, Singapore faces the dual problems of rising {{health care costs}} and an aging population. To cope with these problems, the Singapore government introduced the Medishield scheme in 1989 that provides low cost catastrophic medical insurance coverage.

40|$|First, the {{conventional}} wisdom. Because Homo sapiens are a young species and haven 2 ̆ 7 t {{had time to}} genetically differentiate, we modern humans are all basically genetically identical. Because Homo sapiens figured out ways to use culture to overcome natural selection, human genetic evolution <b>ceased</b> <b>ages</b> ago. Because Homo sapiens are genetically very similar and not subject to natural selection, the differences that we see today among modern human groups {{are the result of}} cultural processes, not genes. Not so say Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending in their challenging and sure-to-be-controversial new book The 10, 000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution (Basic Books, 2009). We are extraordinarily similar genetically, but the minor differences occasionally had very important consequences: a difference of one or two nucleotides [...] among billions [...] could mean life or death for entire populations. These minor differences, where advantageous, were selected for and spread in the ordinary natural selective way: if you developed resistance to malaria in the tropics, you survived and your genes were passed on; if not, then not. Finally, these genetic advantages accumulated: populations that had been put under more 2 ̆ 2 pressure 2 ̆ 2 were more robust than those living in relaxed environments. The more robust populations prospered; the less robust did not. Interesting for the historian will be the point that most of the enhanced 2 ̆ 2 pressure 2 ̆ 2 was due to historical factors. According to Cochran and Harpending, the transition to agriculture roughly 10, 000 years ago in particular forced Homo sapiens to do things that they were not 2 ̆ 2 programmed 2 ̆ 2 (so to say) to do. Those who adapted genetically survived; those who did not, did not. Thus Homo sapiens 1. 0 (the hunter-gatherer model) evolved into Homo sapiens 2. 0 (the farming model). Cochran and Harpending submit that this process [...] natural selection due to cultural pressure [...] has been going on quite recently and may be going on today. For example, they propose that historical factors in the European Middle Ages favored the differential reproduction of brainy Azhkenazi Jews, the results of which {{can be seen in the}} differential success of their descendants in brainy occupations.

40|$|CURRENTLY CONSIDERABLE UN-certainty exists {{about the}} bestuse of cancer {{screening}} testsin older people. 1 Part of this {{stems from a}} lack of randomized con-trolled trials of screening interven-tions that have included patients older than 75 years.
