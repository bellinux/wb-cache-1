50|$|The {{standard}} uses {{capital letters}} S and Z {{to indicate the}} direction of twist, {{as suggested by the}} direction of slant of the central portions of these two letters. The handedness of the twist is the direction of the twists as they progress away from an observer. Thus Z-twist is said to be right-handed, and S-twist to be left-handed. The convention of using these two letters to unambiguously designate twist direction was already used in the <b>cordage</b> <b>industry</b> by 1957.|$|E
50|$|The Canadian branch plant of the Plymouth Cordage Company {{was started}} in 1904 due to Parliament's {{initiation}} of a 25% import duty on rope and related products. Plymouth, with roots in Massachusetts, moved to secure its business in binding twine, necessary to package farm crops such as grass, wheat or straw. The city of Welland grew up around the Plymouth plant, which was prior to 1904, farmland (owned by Morwood, McCoppen, Leitch and Gunn). The <b>cordage</b> <b>industry</b> {{was a victim of}} the harvester-thresher, which obviated the need for binding (or baling) twine, as the threshing operation is now performed in a contiguous step immediately when the stalk is cut.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} the Crown in the import substitution of munitions of warfare in England from 1558 to 1642. It will attempt to determine whether the Crown was responsible for their introduction and subsequent development, and if it was, why. The cordage, sailcloth and gunpowder industries were chosen as case studies in order to examine this issue. All three were first determined to have been import substituted during this period. While the Crown clearly thought these goods were necessary for national security, it cannot be assumed that it assisted these industries and that it did so because it was concerned that supplies coming from the continent might be difficult to procure. Important aspects to consider are first, the impact of the Crown on these native industries through its direct purchasing behaviour, and secondly, the impact on the industries of government acts and ordinances. If the Crown was interested in reducing dependence on foreign suppliers for these goods, then it would be expected that the Crown would, through purchasing behaviour and through legislation, support the domestic industries. It is argued here that when the Crown did act with the domestic industries in mind, fiscalism and personal finance were important considerations. It often appears to have done nothing at all. This is particularly true of the sailcloth <b>industry.</b> <b>Cordage</b> appears to have received its initial impetus as a result of personal financial concerns, but subsequent Crown support appears to have been fiscal. While interest in a domestic source of gunpowder seems apparent, fiscalism runs like a thread throughout all Crown interactions with the industry...|$|R
50|$|Apart from ropes, twines, {{and general}} cordage, sisal {{is used in}} {{low-cost}} and specialty paper, dartboards, buffing cloth, filters, geotextiles, mattresses, carpets, handicrafts, wire rope cores, and Macramé. Sisal has been utilized as an environmentally friendly strengthening agent to replace asbestos and fibreglass in composite materials in various uses including the automobile industry. The lower-grade fibre is processed by the paper industry because of its high content of cellulose and hemicelluloses. The medium-grade fibre {{is used in the}} <b>cordage</b> <b>industry</b> for making ropes, baler and binder twine. Ropes and twines are widely employed for marine, agricultural, and general industrial use. The higher-grade fibre after treatment is converted into yarns and used by the carpet industry.|$|E

However, tarred rigging is used today on craft of various types {{to such an extent}} that the production of tarred goods is an important branch of the <b>cordage</b> <b>industry.</b> The tar best suited for cordage comes from various members of the pine tree family and is obtained by the distillation process, either by using the old kiln or by modern retorts. It is conceded that the kiln-made article is superior for tarred rigging and therefore it is used principally in making first-quality tarred rope. The tar, as it comes from the kiln, is poured into barrels which are shipped to the cordage works. The way this tar is handled and how it is made to penetrate and adhere to the yarn, as is done by the Plymouth Cordage Company, North Plymouth, Mass., may be described as follows: ...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} examines three historical {{issues of}} the henequen industry of Yucatan, Mexico, from approximately 1880 to 1987. The first hypothesis is concerned with International Harvester signing agreements with several brokers in Merida, Yucatan, alleging that International Harvester acted as a monopsonist;A supply model of henequen that included the biological features of the henequen plant was developed. The producer 2 ̆ 7 s planting decision was modelled with a profit function subject to a vintage production function. Production was {{shown to be a}} function of lagged prices. The long run supply elasticity, estimated from regressions using both nominal and real prices, was found to about. 80 suggesting an inelastic supply;A demand function was estimated assuming that the short run supply curve was perfectly inelastic. Actual and predicted henequen output, U. S. wheat production and prices, Philippine abaca exports, and a dummy variable representing International Harvester as a monopsonist were used as independent variables with real henequen prices as the dependent variable. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that henequen prices were determined in a competitive international market and International Harvester did not behave as a monopsonist;The second hypothesis was concerned with henequen exports and the campesinos 2 ̆ 7 standard of living. A relationship of birth rates to proxies for income and consumption was asserted. Birth data from four Yucatecan communities for the years from 1880 to 1930 was gathered for the dependent variable. The independent variables were henequen and corn prices. The statistical results were that births tended to increase with higher henequen prices and fall with higher corn prices;The last hypothesis stated that the changes in the henequen industry occurring after 1937 should lead to a lower supply elasticity of henequen. The changes included a land reform movement, the development of a government bank to finance and manage the ejidos, and the nationalization of the Yucatecan <b>cordage</b> <b>industry.</b> The estimates for the price elasticities was about. 80 again, indicating the supply elasticity of this period was about {{the same as that of}} the earlier period...|$|E
