The {{criteria used}} to identify these carriage patterns have been inconsistent. In 1988 the S. aureus nasal <b>carrier</b> <b>index,</b> i. e., the proportion of nasal swab specimen cultures yielding S. aureus, was determined for 91 staff members of various departments of a large university hospital by obtaining weekly nasal swab specimens for culture over a 12 -week period. Thirty-three (36 %) persons had carrier indices of 0. 80 or higher, 15 (17 %) had indices between 0. 1 and 0. 7, and 43 (47 %) had indices of zero. In 1995, 17 individuals with carrier indices of 0. 80 or higher in 1988 were available for reexamination. For 12 (71 %) of these individuals, S. aureus was again isolated from a single nasal swab, i. e., from each individual with a 1988 <b>carrier</b> <b>index</b> of 1. 0 but from only half of those with indices below 1. 0.

40|$|Abstract—Phase {{noise in}} {{mutually}} synchronized oscillator sys-tems is analyzed for arbitrary coupling and injection-locking topologies, neglecting amplitude noise, and amplitude modulation (AM) to phase modulation (PM) conversion. When the coupling phase is chosen properly (depending on the oscillator model), the near-carrier phase noise {{is reduced to}} 1 =N that of a single oscilla-tor, provided the coupling network is reciprocal. This is proved in general, and illustrated with specific cases of globally coupled and nearest-neighbor coupled oscillator chains. A slight noise degra-dation is found for unilaterally coupled (nonreciprocal) chains. The 1 =N reduction for reciprocal coupling applies over nearly {{the entire range of}} free-running frequency distributions required for beam-scanning, and is verified experimentally using a linear chain of coupled GaAs MESFET voltage-controlled oscillators (VCO’s) operating atX-band. The effect of a nonoptimum coupling phase on the phase noise of the system is also studied. As the coupling phase deviates from the optimum value, the phase noise increases significantly near the locking range edge for noise offset frequency near the <b>carrier.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—AM noise, coupling topology, noise admittance, oscillators, phase noise, power spectral density...|$|E

40|$|Background: Staphylococcus aureus {{carriage}} is a {{risk factor}} for subsequent infections. Data on the prevalence, determinants, population structure and molecular epidemiology of S. aureus nasal carriage among healthy African populations are scarce, especially during infancy. The different S. aureus nasal carriage patterns (intermittent and persistent) were defined in the adult population, however, were ill defined during infancy. A consensus definition for these patterns is still lacking since different approaches were used to define carriage patterns. In addition, few studies used strain genotype to support the intermittent and persistent carriage patterns. This thesis describes the prevalence, determinants, population structure and carriage patterns of S. aureus nasopharyngeal carriage among healthy South African infants and their mothers participating in an intensively sampled cohort. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) were collected on the day of birth from 137 mother-infant pairs and two-weekly thereafter from infants {{during the first year of}} life. S. aureus isolates were characterized by antibiotic susceptibility testing, PCR detection of the mecA and Panton-Valentine Leuckocidin (PVL) genes, and typed by targeting the Staphylococcal protein A locus. All genetically related spa types were clustered into spa-clonal complexes using the 'based upon repeat pattern clustering analysis. The Logistic regression model for binomial outcomes, Cox proportional hazards model, and Pearson's Chi-square and correlation coefficient tests were used to determine S. aureus NP carriage dynamics and determinants. Median permutation test was performed to determine the difference in the median carriage duration for each genotype. The NP carriage dynamics i. e. incidence, acquisition, and carriage patterns were analysed at the species and the genotype levels. Genotype diversity (number of spa-clonal complexes carried by the infant and the alpha diversity) were incorporated with the <b>carrier</b> <b>index</b> to define the carriage patterns. Results: S. aureus was identified in 21 % (725 / 3292) of the NP swabs; 704 isolates from infants and 21 from mothers. S. aureus NP carriage occurred from birth, peaked by four weeks of age and declined over the following 11 months. Male gender, higher socioeconomic status, maternal carriage, large family size and hospitalization were risk factors for S. aureus NP carriage. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 1. 7 % among infants and none of the mothers carried MRSA at birth. Genotyping of 725 S. aureus isolates by targeting the spa gene resulted in 85 spa types. BURP analysis clustered 71 spa types (n= 578) into 11 spa-clonal complexes (spa-CCs). Eleven spa types (n= 116) were singletons and three spa types (n= 27) were excluded from the cluster analysis due to the small number of repeats. The PVL prevalence was 21 % (155 / 725) consisted mainly on MSSA. Eighty three percent of S. aureus strains were resistant to penicillin, 9. 1 % to gentamicin, 3. 4 % to tetracycline, and 3. 1 % and 2. 8 % to cotrimoxazole and rifampicin, respectively. Constitutive erythromycin resistance was identified in 1. 7 % (n= 12), whereas the inducible MLSB phenotype (ICR) was observed in 2 % (n= 18) of isolates. All isolates were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid and mupirocin. A strong relationship between the spa-clonal complexes and antimicrobial resistance phenotypes was noted. We also documented shifts in the resistance patterns over time within the same genotype carried by the same infant. This study demonstrates the importance of strain genotyping to fully describe carriage dynamics; the incidence of acquisition was higher (0. 65 episodes per 100 child days) at the genotype level compared to (0. 24 episodes) the species level. During the first year of life, the acquisition rate was 1. 8 acquisitions per 137 child-year at the species level compared to 2. 4 acquisitions per 137 child-year. At the level of the individual child, a positive correlation (r= 0. 6; 95 % CI 0. 46 – 0. 70, p < 0. 0001) was observed between genotype diversity and the proportion of samples testing positive for S. aureus. Using the genotype diversity measure we found that true persistent carriage with a single strain is rare (2 %) during infancy. Conclusion: This study provide baseline data on the prevalence, determinants, population structure and dynamics of S. aureus NP carriage among South African infants. A low prevalence of MRSA was observed in this cohort. A diverse MSSA population with relatively high PVL prevalence was observed. Persistent carriage with a single strain was uncommon during the first year of life. The detailed phenotypic and genotypic analysis of S. aureus in this intensively sampled birth cohort has extended our knowledge of the nature and determinants of NP carriage during infanc...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} we show the Channel coding plays a very {{important}} role in OFDM systems performance. The structure of OFDM systems makes channel coding more effective in confronting fading channels. Sometimes Coded OFDM is known as COFDM. The role of channel coding in conjunction with frequency and time interleaving is to provide a link between bits transmitted on separated carriers of the signal spectrum, {{in such a way that}} the information conveyed by faded carriers can be reconstructed in the receiver. Frequency selectivity, currently known to be a disadvantage, is then turned into an advantage that can be called frequency diversity. Using Channel State Information (CSI), channel coding can yield some additional gain. Channel state information is frequency response of the channel or signal to noise ratio in each carrier. This paper presents Space-Time Coded OFDM system consisting of two transmitters and a single receiver. Simple space time code is used. 4 - PSK modulation is used to modulate the symbols across an OFDM channel. We also proposed a variation of the scheme which tries to spread additional symbols across time frequency attempting to increase the rate of transmission without changing the type of modulation employed or increasing the bandwidth. A Rayleigh frequency selective slow fading channel is assumed throughout the analysis.

We aimed to discover and validate a gene-brain-behavior pathway by linking presumed genetic risk for anxiety-related psychopathology, key neural activity involved in anxious anticipation, and resulting aversive emotional states. Methods The functional neuroanatomy of aversive anticipation was probed through functional magnetic resonance imaging in two independent samples of healthy subjects (n = 99 and n = 69), and we studied the influence of genetic variance in the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5 -HTTLPR). Skin conductance and startle data served as objective psychophysiological indices of the intensity of individuals’ anticipatory responses to potential threat. Results Threat cues signaling risk of future electrical shock activated the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), anterior insula, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, thalamus, and midbrain consistently across both samples. Threat-related dmPFC activation was enhanced in 5 -HTTLPR short allele carriers in sample 1 and this effect was validated in sample 2. Critically, we show that this region mediates the increase in anticipatory psychophysiological reactions in short allele <b>carriers</b> <b>indexed</b> by skin conductance (experiment 1) and startle reactions (experiment 2).
