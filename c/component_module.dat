40|$|If M is a Drinfeld module over a local {{function}} field L, we {{may view}} M as a dynamical system, and consider its filled Julia set J. If J^ 0 is the connected {{component of the}} identity, relative to the Berkovich topology, we give a characterisation of the <b>component</b> <b>module</b> J/J^ 0 which {{is analogous to the}} Kodaira-Neron characterisation of the special fibre of a Neron model of an elliptic curve over a non-archimedean field. In particular, if L is the fraction field of a discrete valuation ring, then the <b>component</b> <b>module</b> is finite, and moreover trivial in the case of good reduction. In the context of global function fields, the filled Julia set may be considered as an object over the ring of finite adeles. In this setting we formulate a conjecture about the structure of the (finite) <b>component</b> <b>module</b> which, if true, would imply Poonen's Uniform Boundedness Conjecture for torsion on Drinfeld modules of a given rank over a given global function field.

It models the geometry and the dosimetrical characteristics of the add-on miniature multileaf collimator ModuLeaf (MRC Systems GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany, now part of Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The new <b>component</b> <b>module</b> is partly based on the existing CM called DYNVMLC.

In order to validate the new CM, the PRIMUS linac with 6 MV x-rays (Siemens OCS, Concord, California, USA) equipped with the ModuLeaf mini MLC was modeled. Validation was performed by two methods: (a) a ray-tracing method to check the correct geometry of the MLC, and (b) a comparison of calculated and measured results of the following dosimetrical parameters: output factors, dose profiles, field edge position, penumbra, MLC interleaf leakage and transmission values. An excellent agreement was found for all parameters. It was in particular also found that the relationship between leaf position and field edge depending on the shape of leaf ends can be investigated with a higher accuracy by this new calculation tool than by measurements further demonstrating the usefulness of the new CM...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Reasoning about {{software}} {{systems at}} the architectural level {{is key to}} effective software development, management, evolution and reuse. All too often, though, the lack of appropriate documentation leads to a situation where architectural design information has to be recovered directly from implemented software artifacts. This is a very demanding process, particularly when involving recovery of runtime abstractions (clients, servers, interaction protocols, etc.) that are typical {{to the design of}} distributed software systems. This paper presents an exploratory reverse engineering approach, called X-ray, to aid programmers in recovering architectural runtime information from a distributed system’s existing software artifacts. X-ray comprises three domain-based static analysis techniques, namely <b>component</b> <b>module</b> classification, syntactic pattern matching, and structural reachability analysis. These complementary techniques can facilitate the task of identifying a distributed system’s implemented executable components and their potential runtime interconnections. The <b>component</b> <b>module</b> classification technique automatically distinguishes source code modules according to the executables components they implement. The syntactic pattern matching technique in turn helps to recognise specific code fragments that may implement typical component interaction features. Finally, the structural reachability analysis technique aids in the association of those features to the code specific for each executable component. The paper describes and illustrates the main concepts underlying each technique, reports on their implementation as a suit of new and off-the-shelf tools, and...|$|E

40|$|As {{industry}} {{strives to}} standardize engineering design, manufacturing, and maintenance processes, {{the focus on}} achieving component modularity is increasing. Component swapping modularity (CSM) in control systems allows component change without redesign of the system level controller, while achieving the required system performance. Opportunities to achieve CSM are emerging in control systems consisting of smart components connected by bidirectional communication networks. By distributing {{a part of the}} controller into the <b>component</b> <b>module,</b> controller recalibration can be limited to only the <b>component</b> <b>module</b> when the component changes. In this dissertation, a novel Direct Method is proposed to generate the distributed controller with CSM through a bi-level optimization. The distributed controller enables CSM and provides required system performance for each component variant. The Direct Method is applied to throttle actuator CSM design in engine idle speed control. The results demonstrate that the new Direct Method improves the CSM results compared to the previous 3 -Step Method. In addition, the Direct Method permits the designer to trade off desired system performance versus achievable CSM. The Direct Method is then applied to design a distributed supervisory controller for battery CSM in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. A novel feedback based controller for the charge sustaining mode is proposed. For effective controller distribution, a method based on sensitivity analysis of the control signals with respect to the battery hardware parameter is introduced. The bi-level optimization problem for the distributed controller gains is solved using the Augmented Lagrangian Decomposition method. The results demonstrate that battery CSM can be achieved without compromising fuel economy compared to the centralized control case...|$|E

40|$|Managing {{communications}} in parallel processing systems {{has proven to}} be one of the most critical problems facing designers. As processor speeds continue to increase, communication latency and bandwidth become more of a bottleneck. Traditional network routers receive messages that are examined and forwarded by a local router. Performance is lost both by the time spent examining a message in order to determine its destination, and by the inability of a processor's router to have a global sense of message traffic. The NuMesh system defines a high-speed communication substrate optimized for off-line routing. The goal of the project is to explore a new approach to the construction of modular, high-performance digital systems in which the components plug together in a nearest-neighbor three-dimensional mesh.
