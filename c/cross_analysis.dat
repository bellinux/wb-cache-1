5000|$|A 2013 {{report by}} the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs found that members of racial {{minority}} groups who also identified as transgender {{were more likely to}} experience harassment and hate-motivated violence. Specifically, transgender people of color were 1.5 times more likely to experience threats and intimidation, and 1.5 times more likely to experience sexual assault, than white cisgender individuals. They were also 6 more times more likely to face police violence. In a study that cross analyzed reports of sexual assault and violence against transgender people, Rebecca Stotzer found that these attacks are believed to start as early as age 12, and one study found that the median age for first rapes of transgender individuals of color occurred at age 14 and 15. In fact, one of the studies that Stotzer quoted, conducted by Shannon Wyss, found that transgender high school students had to deal with [...] "full-contact hallways", which respondents in the study described as places where they were pushed, kicked, hit, and even held down and beat up by a group of people. Stotzer's <b>cross</b> <b>analysis</b> covered 1,896 respondents from across the country and found that acts of violence happen across a lifetime for transgender individuals, with multiple acts of violence or intolerance happening on a daily basis. In contrast to white transgender hate crime victims, transgender victims from racial minorities are more likely to identify their race as contributing to the assault, and many perceived violence to stem from negatively representing their racial communities.|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{document}} a comparative study of different computational-fluid-dynamics-based optimization techniques applied to the solution of a three-dimensional wing drag minimization problem. To achieve this objective, three optimization tools were used: SYN 107 (Intelligent Aerodynamics International), MDOPT (The Boeing Company), and OPTIMAS (Israel Aerospace Industries). The first tool employs gradient-based search techniques using the continuous adjoint equation, the second one is a response-surface method, and the last one uses a floating-point genetic algorithm as its search engine. As the starting geometry, the public domain DPW-W 1 wing (a test case for the Third AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop) was used. The comparisons included herein are provided in three stages: <b>cross</b> <b>analysis</b> of the initial geometry by the computational fluid dynamics tools employed in the optimizations, optimization of the initial geometry to minimum drag, and <b>cross</b> <b>analysis</b> of optimal shapes achieved by the optimization tools using all computational fluid dynamics tools employed.

The knowledge is often uncertain or fuzzy when dealing with future events. In addition, experts prefer to use linguistic terms or fuzzy values in their predictions. Therefore, a qualitative <b>cross</b> impact <b>analysis</b> is represented in terms of fuzzy relationships. Four different approaches including crisp binary, crisp rated, fuzzy linguistic and fuzzy rated are applied to a specific case [...] the security appliances sector. The results are then compared depending on the variables' characteristics. The fuzzy approaches reveal different results than the crisp ones. The fuzzy rated approach {{makes it possible to}} "infer in a wider perspective" from the results and pick out hidden variables. On the other hand, the results of the fuzzy linguistic approach help in deciding for variables where indecision is high in other approaches. Finally, in contrast to crisp approaches, the fuzzy approaches are more successful in representing uncertainty.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relative}} importance of firm-specific human capital vs. occupationspecific human capital in labor markets using Swedish employer-employee match data. A simple model is developed to illustrate that {{the relative importance}} not only determines the wage-tenure profile, but also simultaneously determines workers ’ mobility and promotion patterns both within and across firms and occupations. However, previous studies have largely ignored occupation-specific human capital, and analyzed wage, mobility, or promotion in isolation. Thus this paper presents a <b>cross</b> <b>analysis</b> of (i) how both firm- and occupation-tenure affect wages, (ii) how firm- and occupation-tenure affect workers ’ mobility within or across firms and occupations, and (iii) how firms promote and hire from within or outside firms and occupations. This <b>cross</b> <b>analysis</b> consistently suggests that on average, occupation-specific human capital is more important than firm-specific human capital. However, there exist large variations across occupations. For example, in medical field occupations, occupation-specific human capital is more important than firm-specific human capital, but in marketing, the opposite holds. Therefore, general conclusion irrespective occupations can be misleading. The patterns of occupation heterogeneity are also consistent across wage, mobility, and promotion analyses.

An increase in solar cor-puscular activity causes a deceleration of zonal atmospheric circulation which, like a torque, causes a deceleration of the Earth’s rotation that, in turn, causes a decrease in sea surface temperature. Application of this holistic model allows us to predict a gradual decline in global warming starting from the current decade...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Planning {{has lost}} its soul. The {{ebb and flow of}} spatial economics, the only {{determinant}} of successful places and/or regions, dictates ritual to the detriment of innovation, ingenuity and in some instances, logic. The plethora of rules, programmes and processes that plague planning have rendered it (planning) redundant and reactive. In this way, planning has increasingly alienated its original purpose: to sensitise the environment to humankind’s needs to the environment’s abundant opportunities {{in the midst of the}} environment’s fragility and sensitivity. Contemporary challenges including civil wars, global warming, climate change and rampant economic recessions are nothing short of catastrophic considering mankind’s higher intellectual capacities. Rather than being the conduit for change, planning, through rules and numerous protocols, has tamed its protagonists to such an extent that it has systematically mechanised its agents into narrow-minded thinking pawns. Planning proponents need to rediscover the very purpose of planning: to imagine better alternate futures and to continuously seek the means of attaining these futures. Planning’s interdisciplinary nature requires flexibility unparalleled to any other profession whose aims are to improve societies livelihoods and the sustainability of human settlements. This paper seeks to redefine the role of planning in society. In addition, it aims to explore and rationalise planning in such a way that lessens its bureaucracy and habitualness. Thus, the role of the ordinary citizen in planning is questioned and garnered for. Lastly, entrenched modes of thinking, at least as far as planning is concerned, are challenged and alternative, more proactive approaches suggested. I will conduct a <b>cross</b> <b>analysis</b> of contemporary planning tools and procedures. It is envisaged that this <b>cross</b> <b>analysis</b> will elucidate the shortcomings or gaps in planning in solving contemporary settlement and societal issues.
