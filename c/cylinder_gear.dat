50|$|Pompeo sent a Crosley {{engine to}} Bandini {{for him to}} study and use. Lightweight and compact, this American engine was very versatile, having been used with boats, aircraft, and even in fire pumps. It had {{aluminium}} block with five main bearings, monoblock with to two valves per <b>cylinder,</b> <b>gear</b> driven single overhead cam, and more. Bandini immediately began making modifications for racing, including longer Stroke steel crankshaft (raising the displacement to 747 cc), new pistons, camshafts, and oil pump.|$|E
50|$|He {{collaborated with}} Nigel Gresley {{to develop the}} Gresley {{conjugated}} valve gear for 3-cylinder locomotives as fitted to LNER 3 cylinder locomotives. Holcroft continued to develop this mechanism by driving the middle <b>cylinder</b> <b>gear</b> of a steam locomotive from the outside cylinder combination levers, as opposed to Gresley's method of using direct transmission from the front valve spindles. This was necessary {{in the case of}} the SECR / SR Moguls because there was insufficient space for Holcroft's original gear to fit between the cylinder leading wheels and first drivers. Holcroft's method had a number of advantages. The Gresley design of conjugated valve gear suffered from variations in valve events brought about by heat expansion of the valve spindles and flexing of the combination lever - even after considerable re-design of the lever and pivot bracket, affecting the valve events when the locomotive was under way. By using the combination lever assembly to drive the middle cylinder, Holcroft managed to circumvent these problems. Subsequently the problem of flexure and lost motion caused the gear to be removed from the SR Moguls in 1931, to be replaced by a third set of Walschaerts gear, as allowed for in the original design.|$|E
5000|$|Other, usually older bicycle speedometers are cable {{driven from}} one or other wheel, as in the {{motorcycle}} speedometers described above. These do not require battery power, but can be relatively bulky and heavy, and may be less accurate. The turning force at the wheel may be provided either from a gearing system at the hub (making use {{of the presence of}} e.g. a hub brake, <b>cylinder</b> <b>gear</b> or dynamo) as per a typical motorcycle, or with a friction wheel device that pushes against {{the outer edge of the}} rim (same position as rim brakes, but on the opposite edge of the fork) or the sidewall of the tyre itself. The former type are quite reliable and low maintenance but need a gauge and hub gearing properly matched to the rim and tyre size, whereas the latter require little or no calibration for a moderately accurate readout (with standard tyres, the [...] "distance" [...] covered in each wheel rotation by a friction wheel set against the rim should scale fairly linearly with wheel size, almost as if it were rolling along the ground itself) but are unsuitable for off-road use, and must be kept properly tensioned and clean of road dirt to avoid slipping or jamming.|$|E

40|$|A {{calibration}} method for backlash compensation in <b>cylinder</b> worm <b>gears</b> is described which avoids {{the necessity of}} a direct insight into the gear box. The method is based on repeated measurements of the torsional backlash upon purposfully axial shifting of the gearshaft. It is demonstrated that any <b>cylinder</b> worm <b>gear</b> of ideal geometry can be calibrated using a backlash-maximum cirterium. From experimental investigations on gears of real geometry using a cone gear as well as a hypoid gear, a calibration algorithm has been derived. A robot-assisted tool for backlash-oriented calibration has been developed and integrated into an automated <b>cylinder</b> worm <b>gear</b> assembly unit.

40|$|Abstract: Gear {{transmission}} with a {{small number}} of teeth is widely used as a key component of mopeds, motorcycles, electric bicycles and so on. A parameter design of <b>cylinder</b> <b>gear</b> pairs with small number of teeth was put forward, which was carried out by establishing a optimization model and selecting the preliminary parameters of gear pairs, and then adjusting the parameters according to the meshing interference conditions and the strength theory. The parameters of the compact gear pairs, which meet transmission quality requirements and strength condition tested by finite-element analysis, can be obtained ultimately. The feasibility and rationality of this method are verified by case...|$|E

50|$|A {{positive}} displacement meter may be compared to a bucket or a stopwatch. The stopwatch is started when the flow starts, and stopped when the bucket reaches its limit. The volume divided by the time gives the flow rate. For continuous measurements, we need a system of continually filling and emptying buckets to divide the flow without letting {{it out of the}} pipe. These continuously forming and collapsing volumetric displacements may take the form of pistons reciprocating in <b>cylinders,</b> <b>gear</b> teeth mating against the internal wall of a meter or through a progressive cavity created by rotating oval gears or a helical screw.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} of the steam motor {{is to use the}} developments of the high-speed steam engine, and to apply them to light locomotives. Rather than a large conventional locomotive having only two cylinders, rotating at the speed of the driving wheels, the steam motor uses several small <b>cylinders</b> <b>geared</b> to run at high speeds. With all other factors remaining the same, doubling the speed of a piston engine doubles its power. The steam motor allowed small, light engines to be used. As many of the engine's performance losses remain constant, or are also related to the engine size, these small engines could also be more efficient overall.|$|R

2500|$|As {{part of the}} 1980 Rocket 150 celebrations, Hornby {{released}} a live steam-powered [...] 3½" [...] gauge locomotive, {{a model of the}} Stephenson's Rocket A major goal was to make real live steam accessible to an indoor domestic environment. The boiler was considerably smaller than the external diameter, surrounded by a thick insulating jacket to prevent burns. It was fuelled by butane gas, from cigarette lighter refills. To provide more torque from the small <b>cylinders,</b> <b>gearing</b> was adeptly hidden between the cranks and the wheels. The track was of asymmetric moulded plastic units, representing the fishbelly rails of the period. These could be assembled either way round, to give either curved or straight track.|$|R

5000|$|The {{engine of}} the Class 45 was a marine-type, slow-revving diesel, a Sulzer 12LDA28B with a bore of 280 mm and a stroke of 360 mm. This gave 22 L per cylinder, or 264 L for the whole engine. The unit was {{turbocharged}} and intercooled and gave [...] at 750 rpm. The engine was of the double bank type with two parallel banks of 6 <b>cylinders,</b> <b>geared</b> together to a single output shaft. Six-cylinder versions of the engine were fitted in the Class 25 locos (amongst others) and eight-cylinder versions in Class 33s. Class 45s were the updated versions of the Class 44 locomotives, the latter having a [...] non-intercooled {{version of the same}} engine; i.e. the 12LDA28A. The later Class 47 had {{a modified version of the}} same engine, a 12LDA28C.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had inside cylinders, arranged at an incline, with slide valves {{which were}} actuated by Stephenson valve gear through rocker shafts. The <b>cylinders</b> and valve <b>gear</b> were placed between the plate frames and {{hidden from view}} by the wheels, which were coupled with external connecting rods. Together with the Cape Town Railway & Dock’s Blackie of 1859, these were the only two-cylinder locomotives with an inside <b>cylinder</b> and valve <b>gear</b> arrangement to see service in South Africa.|$|R

50|$|Thermoforming {{has benefited}} from {{applications}} of engineering technology3, although the basic forming process {{is very similar to}} what was invented many years ago. Microprocessor and computer controls on more modern machinery allow for greatly increased process control and repeatability of same-job setups from one production run with the ability to save oven heater and process timing settings between jobs. The ability to place formed sheet into an inline trim station for more precise trim registration has been hugely improved due to the common use of electric servo motors for chain indexing versus air <b>cylinders,</b> <b>gear</b> racks, and clutches on older machines. Electric servo motors are also used on some modern and more sophisticated forming machines for actuation of the machine platens where form and trim tooling are mounted, rather than air cylinders which have traditionally been the industry standard, giving more precise control over closing and opening speeds and timing of the tooling. Quartz and radiant-panel oven heaters generally provide more precise and thorough sheet heating over older cal-rod type heaters, and better allow for zoning of ovens into areas of adjustable heat..|$|R

50|$|The New York Central had two L-1 {{locomotives}} rebuilt by Alco in 1922 {{with three}} cylinders {{to help determine}} if three-cylinder drive was worthwhile.
