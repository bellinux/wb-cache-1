50|$|One of {{the papers}} in Key and Smith defines channel holding time as being equal to the average holding time divided by {{the average number of}} handovers per call plus one.Usually an {{exponential}} model is preferred to calculate the channel holding time for simplicity in simulations. This model gives the distributionfunction of channel holding time and it is an approximation {{that can be used to}} obtain estimates channel holding time. The exponential model may not be correctly modelling the channel holding timedistribution as other papers may try to prove, but it gives an approximation. Channel holding time is not easily determined explicitly, <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time and user's movements have to bedetermined in order to implicitly give channel holding time. The mobility of the user and the cell shape and sizecause the channel holding time to have a different distribution function to that of call duration (<b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time). This difference is large for highly mobile users and small cell sizes. Since the channel holding time andcall duration relationships are affected by mobility and cell size, for a stationary MS and large cell sizes,channel holding time and call duration are the same.|$|E
50|$|Important {{parameters}} {{like the}} carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I), spectral efficiency and reuse distance determine {{the quality of}} service of a cellular network. Channel Holding Time is another parameter that can {{affect the quality of}} service in a cellular network, hence it is considered when planning the network. Calculating the channel holding time, however is not easy. (This is the time a Mobile Station (MS) remains in the same cell duringa call). Channel holding time is therefore less than <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time if the MS travels more than one cellas handover will take place and the MS relinquishes the channel. Practically, {{it is not possible to}} determine exactly the channelholding time. As a result, different models exist for the channel holding time distribution.

40|$|Abstract—In a {{personal}} communication service (PCS) network, the call completion probability and the effective <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times for both complete and incomplete calls are central parameters {{in the network}} cost/performance evaluation. These quantities {{will depend on the}} distributions of <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times and cell residence times. The classical assumptions made in the past that <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times and cell residence times are exponentially distributed are not appropriate for the emerging PCS networks. This paper presents some systematic results on the probability of call completion and the effective <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> time distributions for complete and incomplete calls with general cell residence times and <b>call</b> <b>holding</b> times distributed with various distributions such as Gamma, Erlang, hyperexponential, hyper-Erlang, and other staged distributions. These results provide a set of alternatives for PCS network modeling, which can be chosen to accommodate the measured data from PCS field trials. The application of these results in billing rate planning is also discussed.
