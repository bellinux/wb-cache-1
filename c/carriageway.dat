5|$|After Winterbourne Stoke {{the route}} once again becomes dual <b>carriageway</b> from Yarnbury Castle {{and across the}} Wylye valley, meeting the A36 at Deptford. There is then another section of single <b>carriageway</b> road, {{coming out of the}} valley and up to the crest of the Great Ridge, before a further section of dual two lane road down from the hill crest near Berwick St Leonard. On {{reaching}} the valley, it reverts again to single <b>carriageway</b> and through the village of Chicklade, before following the terrain over to Mere, where it runs north of the town as another dual <b>carriageway</b> bypass. Continuing west, it passes south of Wincanton and then north of Sparkford to a roundabout where the road reverts once more to single <b>carriageway.</b>|$|E
5|$|Further {{works in}} the 1990s saw a second <b>carriageway</b> {{constructed}} from Mundaring to Sawyers Valley, and then extended to The Lakes {{at the edge of}} Perth. A dual <b>carriageway</b> was also constructed in Kalgoorlie, and a long overtaking lane was built near Clackline.|$|E
5|$|The South Circular Road starts {{just south}} of the ferry {{terminal}} where the A2204 Ferry Approach meets the main east-west road through Woolwich, the A206. It heads south, climbing up John Wilson Street, a section of dual <b>carriageway,</b> until it meets Grand Depot Road and becomes single <b>carriageway</b> through Woolwich Common and Academy Road past the former Royal Military Academy. The route continues south to the A2 at a grade separated junctionone of only two on the routeand continues southwesterly as a dual <b>carriageway,</b> crossing Eltham Road (A210) and Sidcup Road (A20). At the junction with Burnt Ash Hill the road becomes urban single <b>carriageway</b> again, which it remains the case for most of the remainder of the route.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, the Environment Secretary, Peter Walker {{announced}} {{the entire length}} of the A303 would be upgraded as part of a new roads programme that would deliver 1,000 new miles of motorway by 1980. A bypass of Marsh was opened in 1976; it was (and remains) the only dual <b>carriageway</b> upgrade of the A303 through the Blackdown Hills. By the mid-1980s, the A303 had been extended from its original fork by Micheldever Station, next to the A30, eastwards to meet the M3 motorway, and was a completely uninterrupted dual <b>carriageway</b> westwards as far as Amesbury. Ilminster was bypassed around this time; however the new road was built as single <b>carriageway</b> with 3 lanes, which caused a serious safety hazard leading to several fatal accidents.|$|E
2500|$|Dual <b>carriageways</b> or expressways in Croatia (...) are non-tolled roads with 2 or more lanes in each direction, {{but without}} {{emergency}} lanes. The main highways/motorways in Croatia are also dual <b>carriageways,</b> {{but they have}} emergency lanes and tolls.|$|R
50|$|The Expressways of Singapore {{are special}} roads that allow motorists to travel quickly from one urban area to another. All {{of them are}} dual <b>carriageways</b> with grade-separated access. They usually have three to four lanes in each direction, {{although}} there are two-lane <b>carriageways</b> at many expressway - expressway intersections and five-lane <b>carriageways</b> in some places. There are ten expressways, including the new Marina Coastal Expressway. Studies about the feasibility of additional expressways are ongoing.|$|R

5|$|In October 2012 {{the state}} {{government}} announced that the freeway's diamond interchange with Reid Highway will be upgraded with the installation of extra turning lanes and traffic lights. The project is an interim solution to lower congestion and reduce the volume of traffic using local roads to avoid the interchange. The longer term plan is to upgrade Reid Highway to a dual <b>carriageway</b> near the freeway interchange, including a second overpass bridge. The dual <b>carriageway</b> works are scheduled for construction in 2014–15.|$|E
5|$|Southbound, {{the freeway}} {{is divided into}} two carriageways, both of which provide access to the DVP. The outer <b>carriageway</b> also {{provides}} access from Sheppard and to Highway401, including the westbound express lanes, while the inner <b>carriageway</b> is intended for DVP-bound traffic. The HOV lane also provides access to westbound Highway401 via a dedicated tunnel, which passes beneath the other southbound lanes.|$|E
5|$|The Wellington bypass was {{constructed}} by contractor M. J. Gleeson Ltd, from 1973 to 1975. Many problems {{followed in the}} two years after completion; the rigid concrete <b>carriageway</b> broke up, due to the road being built on a poor subbase with rigid concrete along a historically heavily mined route. The aesthetic and constructional design of the bridges was also heavily criticised. Over the next 15 years, almost all of the original <b>carriageway</b> had to be replaced with asphalt.|$|E
50|$|In April 2015 {{the speed}} limit for Heavy Goods Vehicles over 7.5 tonnes was {{increased}} from 40 to 50 mph on single <b>carriageways</b> and from 50 mph to 60 mph on dual <b>carriageways</b> in England and Wales, but not Scotland.|$|R
30|$|The expressways {{are mostly}} 3 -lane dual <b>carriageways,</b> except at certain {{locations}} {{where they are}} upgraded to 4 -lane dual <b>carriageways.</b> The expressways have on-ramps and slip lanes that allow the vehicles to enter or exit, respectively. All the arterial roads are 2 -lane dual <b>carriageways.</b> The lane widths are 3.7  m for expressways and 3.4  m for other roads. The speed limits vary from 80 to 90  km/h for expressways and 60 to 70  km/h for arterials roads.|$|R
50|$|The road itself {{varies in}} {{capacity}} over its length between three-laned dual <b>carriageways</b> and two-way single <b>carriageways.</b> Many junctions {{such as the}} Nepean Highway, Princes Highway, Monash Freeway, Eastern Freeway, Hume Highway and Tullamarine Freeway contribute to large traffic volumes along Route 40.|$|R

5|$|The A45 dual <b>carriageway</b> {{skirting}} to the south, {{links the}} town with the A14, and M1 which also allows links {{to the east and}} west of the country. The A45 links Wellingborough with Northampton, Rushden, Higham Ferrers, Raunds, Thrapston, Oundle and Peterborough.|$|E
50|$|Between 2007 and 2009 4.5 km of {{the highway}} in the Logan City local {{government}} area was upgraded. As well as providing dual <b>carriageways,</b> the work included building service roads so that local traffic {{does not have to}} travel on the main <b>carriageways,</b> thereby reducing congestion.|$|R
50|$|In Belgium, {{motorways}} {{but also}} some dual <b>carriageways</b> have numbers preceded by an A. However, those that also have an E-number are generally referenced with that one. City ring and bypasses have numbers preceded by an R, these also can be either motorways or dual <b>carriageways.</b>|$|R

5|$|The A666 dual <b>carriageway</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Devil's Highway because of its numeric designation), is a spur from the M61/M60 motorway interchange through the town centre to Astley Bridge, Egerton, Darwen and Blackburn. The M61 has three dedicated junctions serving the borough.|$|E
5|$|The prologue was a {{short and}} fairly flat circuit around Liège, with {{expected}} stage times to be about eight minutes. The start ramp was located at Avenue Rogier next to the Parc d'Avroy; the riders then headed north by the Boulevard d'Avroy and Boulevard de la Sauvenière. They then followed the Quai Roosevelt, along the Meuse, until the midway point when they returned on the opposite <b>carriageway,</b> before turning right towards Place Saint-Lambert, {{in front of the}} Palais des Princes-Évêques. From there, the riders rejoined the original route on the opposite <b>carriageway</b> of Boulevard de la Sauvenière before the finish line located on Boulevard d'Avroy {{on the opposite side of}} the Parc d'Avroy from the start.|$|E
5|$|The road then {{bypasses}} Ilchester and RNAS Yeovilton and widens to dual <b>carriageway</b> again. Between Ilchester and Shores Bridge (over the River Parrett, east of South Petherton) {{the road}} follows {{the course of}} the Roman Fosse Way. At Yeovilton the road becomes dual two lane again, and connects with the A37 which joins it until it reaches the end of the bypass. This final section of dual <b>carriageway</b> ends at South Petherton. It runs north of Ilminster as a three-lane road where it meets the A358, providing access to the M5 motorway.|$|E
50|$|The expressways of Singapore are all dual <b>carriageways</b> with grade-separated access.

5|$|This period {{also saw}} the {{planning}} and construction of additional junctions with new major roads in Perth. At Armadale, Armadale Road would connect to {{what had been a}} three-way junction with South Western Highway, while a highway deviation was proposed to connect to the extension of Roe Highway through Beckenham. The proposed deviation became Kenwick Link, constructed as part of the Roe Highway extension towards Fremantle. It was initially built as a single <b>carriageway,</b> and upgraded to a dual <b>carriageway</b> later. It opened on 17 April 1998, ahead of the Roe Highway extensions from Welshpool Road to Kenwick Link (opened 30 November 2002) and from Kenwick Link to Nicholson Road (opened 21 January 2003).|$|E
5|$|This {{section of}} the route was {{constructed}} through {{a process known as}} twinning in which a second <b>carriageway</b> is built parallel to an existing road. In addition, existing intersections were rebuilt as grade-separated interchanges.|$|E
5|$|When the Glynneath bypass {{was built}} in the 1970s, the canal was culverted above Ysgwrfa lock, to allow the road to be straightened, and reduced in width beyond that, to allow the road to be widened. Above Pentremalwed lock, the road was built over the canal bed, and all traces have gone. This road was {{superseded}} by the A465 dual <b>carriageway</b> when it opened in 1996, and has become the B4242 road. The part which covered the final section of the canal is no longer a road, although the dual <b>carriageway</b> runs over the site of the Glynneath basin.|$|E
