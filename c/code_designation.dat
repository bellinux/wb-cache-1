25|$|The ship's <b>code</b> <b>designation</b> {{was changed}} {{based on a}} new classification, name, number and {{categorization}} of PN ships, crafts, aircraft, and ground equipage dated April 2016. Based on this change, the ship's designation was changed from PF-11 to PS-11.|$|E

Amongst the law's provisions {{is an increase}} of 30 years in the duration of copyright; thus most of Saint-Exupéry's creative works will not fall out of copyright status in France for an extra 30 years. So the original French text was in copyright almost {{everywhere in the world}} except in the USA until January 1, 2015 and will remain in copyright in France until 2032.|$|E

25|$|By type of procedure: Amputation {{involves}} {{cutting off}} a body part, usually a limb or digit; castration {{is also an}} example. Resection is the removal of all of an internal organ or body part, or a key part (lung lobe; liver quadrant) of such an organ or body part that has its own name or <b>code</b> <b>designation.</b> Replantation involves reattaching a severed body part. Reconstructive surgery involves reconstruction of an injured, mutilated, or deformed part of the body. Excision is the cutting out or removal of only part of an organ, tissue, or other body part from the patient. Transplant surgery is the replacement of an organ or body part by insertion of another from different human (or animal) into the patient. Removing an organ or body part from a live human or animal for use in transplant is also a type of surgery.|$|E
500|$|The {{code name}} [...] "K-25" [...] was a {{combination}} of the [...] "K" [...] from Kellex, and [...] "25," [...] a World War II-era <b>code</b> <b>designation</b> for uranium-235 (derived from element 92, atomic mass 235). The term was first used in Kellex internal reports for the end product, enriched uranium, in March 1943. By April 1943, the term [...] "K-25 plant" [...] was being used for the plant that created it. That month, the term [...] "K-25 Project" [...] was applied to the entire project to develop uranium enrichment using the gaseous diffusion process. When other [...] "K-" [...] buildings were added after the war, [...] "K-25" [...] became the name of the original, larger complex.|$|E
500|$|Hitler intervened on 4 November 1940, {{four days}} after British troops arrived at Crete and Lemnos. Although Greece was neutral until the Italian invasion, the British troops that were sent as {{defensive}} aid created {{the possibility of a}} frontier to the German southern flank. He ordered his Army General Staff to attack Northern Greece from bases in Romania and Bulgaria in support of his master plan to deprive the British of Mediterranean bases. On 12 November, the German Armed Forces High Command issued Directive No. 18, in which they scheduled simultaneous operations against Gibraltar and Greece for the following January. However, in December 1940, German ambition in the Mediterranean underwent considerable revision when Spain's General Francisco Franco rejected the Gibraltar attack. Consequently, Germany's offensive in southern Europe was restricted to the Greek campaign. The Armed Forces High Command issued Directive No. 20 on 13 December 1940, outlining the Greek campaign under the <b>code</b> <b>designation</b> Operation Marita. [...] The plan was to occupy the northern coast of the Aegean Sea by March 1941 and to seize the entire Greek mainland, if necessary. [...] During a hasty meeting of Hitler's staff after the unexpected 27 March Yugoslav coup d'état against the Yugoslav government, orders for the campaign in Kingdom of Yugoslavia were drafted, as well as changes to the plans for Greece. [...] On 6 April, both Greece and Yugoslavia were to be attacked.|$|E

2500|$|Although many numbers {{stations}} have nicknames which usually describe {{some aspect of}} the station itself, these nicknames have sometimes led to confusion among listeners, particularly when discussing stations with similar traits. M. Gauffman of the ENIGMA numbers stations monitoring group originally assigned a code to each known station. Portions of the original ENIGMA group moved on to other interests in 2000 and the classification of numbers stations was continued by the follow-on group ENIGMA 2000. The document containing the description of each station and its <b>code</b> <b>designation</b> is called the [...] "ENIGMA Control List", whose 26th edition was published in February 2016.

2500|$|The [...] was {{a medium}} tank {{used by the}} Imperial Japanese Army from 1932 to 1942 in combat {{operations}} of the Second Sino-Japanese War, at Khalkhin Gol against the Soviet Union, and in the Second World War. The Type 89B model was the world's first mass-produced diesel engine tank. The tank was armed with a short-barrel 57mm cannon for knocking out pillboxes and masonry fortifications, and proved effective in campaigns in Manchuria and China, as the Chinese National Revolutionary Army had only three tank battalions to oppose them, which consisted primarily of Vickers export models, German Panzer Is, and Italian CV33 tankettes. The Type 89 was a 1920s design medium tank, built to support the infantry, and thus lacked the armor or armament of 1940s generation Allied armor; and was regarded as obsolete {{by the time of}} the 1939 battles of Khalkhin Gol, against the Soviet Union. The <b>code</b> <b>designation</b> [...] "I-Go" [...] comes from the katakana letter [...] for “first” and the kanji [...] for [...] "number". The designation is also transliterated Chi-Ro and sometimes [...] "Yi-Go".|$|E
2500|$|In 1962, Zora Duntov, Chief {{engineer}} at General Motors (GM) first brought forth {{the concept of}} the Z06 following a ban on factory-sponsored racing by the SCCA. Duntov knew customers would continue to race Corvettes even though the ban, which initially had full support from GM management, was in effect. During the planning of the Sting Ray project, Duntov suggested {{that it would be a}} good idea to continue with parts development in order to benefit racers, and as a way of surreptitiously circumventing the racing ban. Eventually, when GM management relented from their support of the ban, Duntov and his colleagues created [...] "RPO Z06" [...] as a special performance equipment package for the Corvette. The Regular Production Option (RPO) was a GM internal ordering <b>code</b> <b>designation.</b> The package was specifically designed for competition-minded buyers, so they could order a race-ready Corvette straight from the factory with just one check of an option box. [...] Previously, the optional racing parts were literally hidden in the order form so that only the most knowledgeable and perceptive customers could find them. [...] The Z06 package was first offered on the 1963 Corvette, and included: ...|$|E

The confusion in radio operations pointed to the growing disintegration of French forces.
