40|$|AbstractWe have {{previously}} shown in experimental cardiac cell monolayers that rapid point pacing can convert basic functional reentry (single spiral) into a stable multiwave spiral that activates the tissue at an accelerated rate. Here, {{our goal is}} to further elucidate the biophysical mechanisms of this rate acceleration without the potential confounding effects of microscopic tissue heterogeneities inherent to experimental preparations. We use computer simulations to show that, similar to experimental observations, single spirals can be converted by point stimuli into stable multiwave spirals. In multiwave spirals, individual waves collide, yielding regions with negative wavefront curvature. When a sufficient excitable gap is present and the negative-curvature regions are close to spiral tips, an electrotonic spread of excitatory currents from these regions propels each colliding spiral to rotate faster than the single spiral, causing an overall rate acceleration. As observed experimentally, the degree of rate acceleration increases with the number of colliding spiral waves. Conversely, if <b>collision</b> <b>sites</b> are far from spiral tips, excitatory currents have no effect on spiral rotation and multiple spirals rotate independently, without rate acceleration. Understanding the mechanisms of spiral rate acceleration may yield new strategies for preventing the transition from monomorphic tachycardia to polymorphic tachycardia and fibrillation...|$|R

The trends of increasing traffic volumes and road densities will only magnify the mortality impacts of roads on large mammals and other vertebrates. In this study, we examined the descriptive and spatial aspects of ungulate-vehicle collisions (UVCs) in the Central Canadian Rocky Mountains (CCRMs). We then spe-cifically addressed the landscape and highway characteristics associated with the UVCs in four major watersheds: the Bow Valley, Kananaskis Valley, Kicking Horse Valley, and Kootenay Valley, each with differing road-types, topography, and habitat. We grouped the factors associated with vehicle collisions into three groups: combined, landscape-animal, and highway-vehicular-animal. The combined model included all variables, the landscape-animal model included factors that influence whether an animal makes it to the roadway, and the road-vehicular model included factors that influence the probability of an interaction between the animal and the vehicle. Between 1999 and 2003 all kill sites were initially measured with a Global Positioning System (GPS) (accuracy < 3 m) and later revisited to measure all field measurements.

Subroutines were developed to calculate the probability of photoneutron production at photon <b>collision</b> <b>sites</b> and the energy and flight direction of the created photoneutrons. These subroutines were implemented into MCNP 4 A. Some small program changes were necessary for processing the input to read the photoneutron production cross sections and to install a photoneutron switch. Some arrays were installed or extended to sample photoneutron creation and loss information, and output routines were changed to give the appropriate summary tables. To verify and validate the photoneutron production data and the MCNP 4 A implementations, the yields of photoneutron sources were calculated and compared with experiments. In the case of deuterium-based photoneutron sources, the calculations agreed well with the experiments; the beryuium-based photoneutron source calculations were up to 30 % higher compared with the measurements. More accurate beryllium photoneutron cross sections would be desirable. To apply the developed method to a real shielding problem, the fast neutron fluxes in the heavy-water-filled reflector vessel of the Advanced Neutron Source reactor were investigated and compared with published DORT calculations. Considering the complete independence between the calculations, the merely 10 to 20 % lower fluxes obtained with MCNP 4 A, compared against the DORT results, were more than satisfactory, as the discrepancy is based primarily on differences in the calculated thermal neutron fluxes...|$|R

By equipping 50 moose (Alces alces) with GPS (global position system) collars and then analyze the positions in GIS (geographic information system) it was possible to create models that could predict where and when moose are closer to roads. The results revealed no evidence that moose are closer to smaller roads, instead an increase of moose close to railroads appeared and also avoidance of larger roads such as major highways, highways and county roads. No evidence was found that moose are close to roads at any specific times during the day, but over the year the moose density close to roads increases for an inland population from December to May and for a coastal population July to November. With more exact information on moose natural movements in a given area authorities can take earlier preventative measures before collisions occur such as seasonal warning signs, growing non-preferred vegetation close to road, higher embankments in certain areas and planning for under- and overpasses at the right location before new roads are being built...|$|R
50|$|Tyler {{therefore}} rejected Cooke's {{evidence that}} he had applied the brake as the train was arriving at Round Oak; the coupling had failed when he released the brake, but he had reapplied the brake on becoming aware of the breakaway; this had initially had some effect, but the runaway had then skidded down the incline with gathering speed. Instead, Tyler thought, Cooke had left the brake van as it arrived at Round Oak, without applying the brake, an obviously necessary precaution against a 'rebound of the buffers' (a shock loading on couplings as coaches hit and bounced back from the coach ahead): consequently a screw coupling had failed (the failed coupling had a grossly defective weld, as did many of the couplings examined on other coaches in the train) and the side chains had in their turn been unable to resist the shock loading. Cooke, thought Tyler, {{had been unable to}} regain the brakevan as the portion of the train {{to the rear of the}} failed coupling ran away but had either travelled down on the runaway or run after it sufficiently fast to reach the <b>collision</b> <b>site</b> soon after the collision. A very few words will suffice for summing up, in conclusion, the causes of this accident. A man was selected by the company for the important duty of head guard to a heavy train who proved to be anything but trustworthy and careful, and who, in not performing that duty with the attention that it required, caused the fracture of a defective coupling, and permitted the greater part of his train to run backwards down a steep gradient, on which it came into violent collision with a following train.|$|E

40|$|The {{primordial}} {{asteroid belt}} contained {{at least several}} hundred and possibly as many as 10, 000 bodies with diameters of 1000 km or larger. Following the formation of Jupiter, nebular gas drag combined with passage of such bodies through Jovian resonances produced high eccentricities (e = 0. 3 - 0. 5), low inclinations (i < 0. 5 deg.), and, therefore, high velocities (3 - 10 km/s) for “resonant” bodies relative to both nebular gas and non-resonant planetesimals. These high velocities would have produced shock waves in the nebular gas through two mechanisms. First, bow shocks would be produced by supersonic motion of resonant bodies relative to the nebula. Second, high-velocity collisions of resonant bodies with non-resonant bodies would have generated impact vapor plume shocks near the <b>collision</b> <b>sites.</b> Both types of shocks would be sufficient to melt chondrule precursors in the nebula, and both are consistent with isotopic evidence for a time delay of ~ 1 - 1. 5 Myr between the formation of CAIs and most chondrules. Here initial simulations are first reported of impact shock wave generation in the nebula and of the local nebular volumes that would be processed by these shocks {{as a function of}} impactor size and relative velocity. Second, the approximate maximum chondrule mass production is estimated for both bow shocks and impact-generated shocks assuming a simplified planetesimal population and a rate of inward migration into resonances consistent with previous simulations.
