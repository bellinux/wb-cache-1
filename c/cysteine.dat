5|$|Some {{amino acids}} have special {{properties}} such as <b>cysteine,</b> that can form covalent disulfide bonds to other <b>cysteine</b> residues, proline that forms a cycle to the polypeptide backbone, and glycine {{that is more}} flexible than other amino acids.|$|E
5|$|The same triad {{geometries}} been converged upon by serine proteases {{such as the}} chymotrypsin and subtilisin superfamilies. Similar convergent {{evolution has}} occurred with <b>cysteine</b> proteases such as viral C3 protease and papain superfamilies. These triads have converged to almost the same arrangement due to the mechanistic similarities in <b>cysteine</b> and serine proteolysis mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif. Several {{families}} of <b>cysteine</b> proteases use this triad set, for example TEV protease and papain. The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, {{with a few}} notable differences. Due to cysteine's low pKa, {{the importance of the}} Asp to catalysis varies and several <b>cysteine</b> proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. hepatitis A virus protease), whilst in others the <b>cysteine</b> is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain). This triad is also used by some amidases, such as N-glycanase to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of the <b>cysteines</b> in the pBR 322 -encoded tetracycline resistance protein have been examined. <b>Cysteines</b> are important but not essential for tetracycline transport activity. None of the <b>cysteines</b> reacted with biotin maleimide, suggesting that they are shielded from the aqueous phase or reside in a negatively charged local environment...|$|R
50|$|Redox {{sensitive}} {{versions of}} GFP (roGFP) were engineered by introduction of <b>cysteines</b> into the beta barrel structure. The redox {{state of the}} <b>cysteines</b> determines the fluorescent properties of roGFP.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of DsbC from E. coli {{as reported by}} McCarthy et al. shows the <b>cysteines</b> in the oxidized state. In wild-type cells, both <b>cysteines</b> are in the reduced state.|$|R
5|$|In {{alternative}} fashion, the (S) and (R) designators {{are used}} to indicate the absolute stereochemistry. Almost all of the amino acids in proteins are (S) at the α carbon, with <b>cysteine</b> being (R) and glycine non-chiral. <b>Cysteine</b> has its side chain in the same geometric position as the other amino acids, but the R/S terminology is reversed because of the higher atomic number of sulfur compared to the carboxyl oxygen gives the side chain a higher priority, whereas the atoms in most other side chains give them lower priority.|$|E
5|$|Peroxiredoxins are peroxidases that {{catalyze}} {{the reduction}} of hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxides, as well as peroxynitrite. They are divided into three classes: typical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins; atypical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins; and 1-cysteine peroxiredoxins. These enzymes share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which a redox-active <b>cysteine</b> (the peroxidatic <b>cysteine)</b> in the active site is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. Over-oxidation of this <b>cysteine</b> residue in peroxiredoxins inactivates these enzymes, but this can be reversed {{by the action of}} sulfiredoxin. Peroxiredoxins seem to be important in antioxidant metabolism, as mice lacking peroxiredoxin 1 or 2 have shortened lifespan and suffer from hemolytic anaemia, while plants use peroxiredoxins to remove hydrogen peroxide generated in chloroplasts.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses use serpins {{to disrupt}} {{protease}} functions in their host. The cowpox viral serpin CrmA (cytokine response modifier A) {{is used in}} order to avoid inflammatory and apoptotic responses of infected host cells. CrmA increases infectivity by suppressing its host's inflammatory response through inhibition of IL-1 and L-18 processing by the <b>cysteine</b> protease caspase-1. In eukaryotes, a plant serpin inhibits both metacaspases and a papain-like <b>cysteine</b> protease.|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} the <b>cysteines</b> flanking the internal fusion peptide of the avian sarcoma/leukosis virus subtype A (ASLV-A) Env (EnvA) are important for infectivity and cell-cell fusion. Here we define the stage of fusion at which the <b>cysteines</b> are required. The flanking <b>cysteines</b> are dispensable for receptor-triggered membrane association but are required for the lipid mixing step of fusion, which, interestingly, displays a high pH onset and a biphasic profile. Second-site mutations that partially restore infection partially restore lipid mixing. These findings indicate that the <b>cysteines</b> flanking the internal fusion peptide of EnvA (and perhaps by analogy Ebola virus glycoprotein) are important for the foldback stage of the conformational changes that lead to membrane merger...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{oxidized}} {{and reduced}} {{forms of the}} [Fe 4 -S 4] ferredoxin I from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Norway were investigated by 1 H NMR spectroscopy {{with the aim of}} obtaining the complete assignment of the <b>cysteines</b> ligating the cluster. A combination of TOCSY and NOESY measurements together with information from the x-ray crystallographic structure of related ferredoxins provided the sequence-specific assignment of the four <b>cysteines</b> coordinated to the cluster. Through EXSY experiments, the hyperfine shifted resonance signals in the reduced ferredoxin were also assigned. The temperature dependence of the contact-shifted cysteinyl residues of the reduced ferredoxin reveals that two <b>cysteines</b> exhibit anti-Curie behavior whereas the other two <b>cysteines</b> display Curie behavior; that identifies Cys 9 (I) and Cys 15 (III) as ligated to the mixed-valence iron ions...|$|R
50|$|Thyroglobulin type-1 repeat is an {{evolutionary}} conserved protein domain.Thyroglobulin type 1 repeats {{are thought to}} be involved in the control of proteolytic degradation. The domain usually contains six conserved <b>cysteines.</b> These form three disulphide bridges. <b>Cysteines</b> 1 pairs with 2, 3 with 4 and 5 with 6.|$|R
5|$|Use {{of oxygen}} or sulphur as the {{nucleophilic}} atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to oxygen, sulphur’s extra d orbital makes it larger (by 0.4 Å) and softer, {{allows it to}} form longer bonds (dC-X and dX-H by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower pKa (by 5 units). Serine is therefore more dependent than <b>cysteine</b> on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its pKa {{in order to achieve}} concerted deprotonation with catalysis. The low pKa of <b>cysteine</b> works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first tetrahedral intermediate as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product. The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to protonate the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas <b>cysteine</b> can leave as S−. Sterically, the sulphur of <b>cysteine</b> also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier van der Waals radius and if mutated to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, an {{alternative}} transferase mechanism has been evolved by amidophosphoribosyltransferases, which has two active sites. In the first active site, a <b>cysteine</b> triad hydrolyses a glutamine substrate to release free ammonia. The ammonia then diffuses though an internal tunnel in the enzyme {{to the second}} active site, where it is transferred to a second substrate.|$|E
5|$|However, not all peptide {{bonds are}} formed in this way. In a few cases, {{peptides}} are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide glutathione {{is an essential}} part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids. In the first step, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses <b>cysteine</b> and glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the <b>cysteine.</b> This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione.|$|E
50|$|Thioredoxins are {{characterized}} {{at the level}} of their amino acid sequence by the presence of two vicinal <b>cysteines</b> in a CXXC motif. These two <b>cysteines</b> are the key to the ability of thioredoxin to reduce other proteins. Thioredoxin proteins also have a characteristic tertiary structure termed the thioredoxin fold.|$|R
50|$|The CC {{chemokine}} (or β-chemokine) proteins {{have two}} adjacent <b>cysteines</b> (amino acids), near their amino terminus. There {{have been at}} least 27 distinct members of this subgroup reported for mammals, called CC chemokine ligands (CCL)-1 to -28; CCL10 is the same as CCL9. Chemokines of this subfamily usually contain four <b>cysteines</b> (C4-CC chemokines), but a small number of CC chemokines possess six <b>cysteines</b> (C6-CC chemokines). C6-CC chemokines include CCL1, CCL15, CCL21, CCL23 and CCL28. CC chemokines induce the migration of monocytes and other cell types such as NK cells and dendritic cells.|$|R
40|$|After mild {{reduction}} of serum albumin, seven among the 34 <b>cysteines</b> forming the disulfide network displayed a surprising hyper-reactivity. Compared to the thiol group of glutathione, the average reactivity of these <b>cysteines</b> towards disulfides and thiol reagents {{was more than}} 100 times higher. Using mass spectrometry and kinetic data, we identified all these unusual residues, with Cys 75, Cys 123 and Cys 264 showing the highest reactivity. This effect was mainly due to a low pKa of the sulfhydryl groups and may explain the very fast formation of early disulfides in the nascent protein suggesting {{the existence of a}} hierarchical propensity to form such covalent links in selected regions during oxidative folding. An identical pattern of hyper-reactive <b>cysteines</b> was found in albumins from six different mammals. This hyper-reactivity is much higher than the one found in other proteins containing multiple <b>cysteines</b> only devoted to structural disulfide bonds. It is possible that such hyper-reactive <b>cysteines</b> could also be present in other proteins, although their existence has been completely ignored so far...|$|R
5|$|In proteins, Zinc ions {{are often}} coordinated to the amino acid side chains of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, <b>cysteine</b> and histidine. The {{theoretical}} and computational description of this zinc binding in proteins (as {{well as that}} of other transition metals) is difficult.|$|E
5|$|Serine and <b>cysteine</b> proteases use {{different}} amino acid functional groups (alcohol or thiol) as a nucleophile. In order to activate that nucleophile, they orient an acidic and a basic residue in a catalytic triad. The chemical and physical constraints on enzyme catalysis have caused identical triad arrangements to evolve independently more than 20 times in different enzyme superfamilies.|$|E
5|$|Some {{drawbacks}} {{of using}} organoiodine compounds {{as compared to}} organochlorine or organobromine compounds is the greater expense and toxicity of the iodine derivatives, since iodine is expensive and organoiodine compounds are stronger alkylating agents. For example, iodoacetamide and iodoacetic acid denature proteins by irreversibly alkylating <b>cysteine</b> residues and preventing the reformation of disulfide linkages.|$|E
50|$|Both of {{the above}} {{relations}} hold good for the proteins which have an even number of <b>cysteines</b> and all the <b>cysteines</b> {{are involved in the}} formation of disulfide bonds. Both {{of the above}} formulae are derived using the same logic and essentially represent a simplification of the same starting formula.|$|R
40|$|PBP 1 b can {{be found}} as a dimer in Escherichia coli. Previous results {{suggested}} that dimerization involved the <b>cysteine(s)</b> in an intermolecular disulfide bond. We show that either deletion mutants or a mutant without <b>cysteines</b> is fully active and still binds penicillin and that the latter can also form dimers...|$|R
40|$|Mutagenesis studies {{indicated}} that the three cytoplasmic <b>cysteines</b> of the influenza virus A/Japan/ 305 / 57 hemagglutinin (HA) are all palmitylated, but to an unequal extent. Replacement of all three <b>cysteines</b> abolished palmitylation, but affected neither HA biosynthesis nor function. Palmitate was not required for HA to be incorporated into virions...|$|R
5|$|Some serpins {{are both}} {{protease}} inhibitors and perform additional roles. For example, the nuclear <b>cysteine</b> protease inhibitor MENT, in birds also {{acts as a}} chromatin remodelling molecule in a bird's red blood cells.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible inhibitors usually covalently modify an enzyme, and {{inhibition}} {{can therefore}} not be reversed. Irreversible inhibitors often contain reactive functional {{groups such as}} nitrogen mustards, aldehydes, haloalkanes, alkenes, Michael acceptors, phenyl sulfonates, or fluorophosphonates. These electrophilic groups react with amino acid side chains to form covalent adducts. The residues modified are those with side chains containing nucleophiles such as hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups; these include the amino acids serine (as in DFP, right), <b>cysteine,</b> threonine, or tyrosine.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{undergo a}} range of posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups {{are attached to the}} amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins, or hydrophilic glycoproteins. These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid palmitic acid to <b>cysteine</b> residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.|$|E

50|$|The enzyme weighs 14 kDa and is {{composed}} of 129 amino acids. The protein is a subunit of Complex IV, which consists of 13 mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded subunits. The sequence of subunit Vb is well conserved and includes three conserved <b>cysteines</b> that coordinate the zinc ion. Two of these <b>cysteines</b> are clustered in the C-terminal section of the subunit.|$|R
40|$|DsbB is {{a protein}} {{component}} of the pathway that leads to disulfide bond formation in periplasmic proteins of Escherichia coli. Previous studies {{have led to the}} hypothesis that DsbB oxidizes the periplasmic protein DsbA, which in turn oxidizes the <b>cysteines</b> in other periplasmic proteins to make disulfide bonds. Gene fusion approaches were used to show that (i) DsbB is a membrane protein which spans the membrane four times and (ii) both the N- and C-termini of the protein are in the cytoplasm. Mutational analysis shows that of the six <b>cysteines</b> in DsbB, four are necessary for proper DsbB function in vivo. Each of the periplasmic domains of the protein has two essential <b>cysteines.</b> The two <b>cysteines</b> in the first periplasmic domain are in a Cys-X-Y-Cys configuration that is characteristic of the active site of other proteins involved in disulfide bond formation, including DsbA and protein disulfide isomerase...|$|R
5|$|Proteins are {{targeted}} for degradation by the proteasome with covalent modification of a lysine residue {{that requires the}} coordinated reactions of three enzymes. In the first step, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (known as E1) hydrolyzes ATP and adenylylates a ubiquitin molecule. This is then transferred to E1's active-site <b>cysteine</b> residue {{in concert with the}} adenylylation of a second ubiquitin. This adenylylated ubiquitin is then transferred to a <b>cysteine</b> of a second enzyme, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). In the last step, a member of a highly diverse class of enzymes known as ubiquitin ligases (E3) recognizes the specific protein to be ubiquitinated and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to this target protein. A target protein must be labeled with at least four ubiquitin monomers (in the form of a polyubiquitin chain) before it is recognized by the proteasome lid. It is therefore the E3 that confers substrate specificity to this system. The number of E1, E2, and E3 proteins expressed depends on the organism and cell type, but there are many different E3 enzymes present in humans, indicating that there is a huge number of targets for the ubiquitin proteasome system.|$|E

These include inhibitors of oxidosqualene cyclase and squalene synthase, <b>cysteine</b> protease inhibitors, dermaseptins collected from frogs in the genus Phyllomedusa (P. oreades and P. distincta), the sesquiterpene lactone dehydroleucodine (DhL), which affects {{the growth of}} cultured epimastigote-phase Trypanosoma cruzi, inhibitors of purine uptake, and inhibitors of enzymes involved in trypanothione metabolism. Hopefully, new drug targets may be revealed following the sequencing of the T. cruzi genome.|$|E
5|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{action of}} iodine is quick and works at low concentrations, {{and thus it}} is used in operating theatres. Its specific mode of action is unknown. It penetrates into microorganisms and attacks particular amino acids (such as <b>cysteine</b> and methionine), nucleotides, and fatty acids, ultimately resulting in cell death. It also has an antiviral action, but nonlipid viruses and parvoviruses are less sensitive than lipid enveloped viruses. Iodine probably attacks surface proteins of enveloped viruses, and it may also destabilise membrane fatty acids by reacting with unsaturated carbon bonds.|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} viruslike {{particles}} (VLPs) of human papillomaviruses {{to study the}} structure and assembly of the viral capsid. We demonstrate that mutation of either of two highly conserved <b>cysteines</b> of the major capsid protein L 1 to serine completely prevents the assembly of VLPs but not of capsomers, whereas mutation of all other <b>cysteines</b> leaves VLP assembly unaffected. These two <b>cysteines</b> form intercapsomeric disulfides yielding an L 1 trimer. Trimerization comprises {{about half of the}} L 1 molecules in VLPs but all L 1 molecules in complete virions. We suggest that trimerization of L 1 is indispensable for the stabilization of intercapsomeric contacts in papillomavirus capsids...|$|R
50|$|The DsbB protein oxidizes the periplasmic protein DsbA {{which in}} turn oxidizes <b>cysteines</b> in other periplasmic {{proteins}} {{in order to make}} disulfide bonds.
