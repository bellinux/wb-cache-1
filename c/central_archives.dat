Eight German infantry, three Panzer, and one Panzergrenadier divisions lost {{more than half of}} their numbers. The elimination of the Nikopol bridgehead enabled the 4th Ukrainian Front to launch the Crimean Offensive without fear of the German forces attacking its rear. Favorable conditions for the subsequent Odessa Offensive were created by the capture of the Inhulets bridgeheads.|$|E

The short-lived hospital drama Mercy filmed at a warehouse in Secaucus, a private residence in Weehawken and a public school in Jersey City. The Law and Order and Mercy productions left New Jersey for New York in 2010 after New Jersey Governor Chris Christie suspended the tax credits for film and television production for the Fiscal Year 2011 to close budget gaps.|$|E
