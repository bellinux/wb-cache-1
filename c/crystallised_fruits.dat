60|$|And then, of course, {{there are}} liqueur glasses, and <b>crystallised</b> <b>fruits,</b> and {{tapestry}} curtains, and heaps of other necessaries {{of life that}} make really sensible presents--not to speak of luxuries, such as having one's bills paid, or getting something quite sweet {{in the way of}} jewellery. Unlike the alleged Good Woman of the Bible, I'm not above rubies. When found, by the way, she must have been rather a problem at Christmas-time; nothing short of a blank cheque would have fitted the situation. Perhaps it's as well that she's died out.|$|E
50|$|In Portugal the New Year celebration {{is taken}} very seriously. The {{tradition}} is to drink champagne and eat twelve raisins - {{one for each}} month of the year, making a wish for each. Another Portuguese tradition is a special cake called Bolo-Rei (literally: King Cake). Bolo-Rei is a round cake with a large hole in the centre, resembling a crown covered with <b>crystallised</b> and dried <b>fruit.</b> It is baked from a soft, white dough, with raisins, various nuts and <b>crystallised</b> <b>fruit.</b> Inside is hidden the characteristic fava (broad bean). Tradition dictates that whoever finds the fava {{has to pay for}} the Bolo-Rei next year. Initially, a small prize (usually a small metal toy) was also included within the cake. However, the inclusion of the prize was forbidden by the European Union for safety reasons. The Portuguese brought the recipe of the Gateau des Rois from France {{in the second half of}} the 19th century. To this day, this recipe is a very well kept secret.|$|R
50|$|Raisins are sweet due {{to their}} high {{concentration}} of sugars (about 30% fructose and 28% glucose by weight). The sugars can <b>crystallise</b> inside the <b>fruit</b> when stored after a long period, making the dry raisins gritty, {{but that does not}} affect their usability. These sugar grains can be dissolved by blanching the fruit in hot water or other liquids.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the percentage reduction in incidence of dementia {{that would be}} obtained if specific risk factors were eliminated. DESIGN: Prospective seven year cohort study. SETTING: General population, Montpellier, France. PARTICIPANTS: 1433 people aged over 65 with a mean baseline age of 72. 5 (SD 5. 1) years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia established by a standardised neurological examination. RESULTS: Cox models were constructed to derive hazard ratios and determine confounding and interaction effects for potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia. Mean percentage population attributable fractions were calculated with 95 % confidence intervals derived from bootstrapping for seven year incidence of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The final model retained crystallised intelligence (population attributable fraction 18. 11 %, 95 % confidence interval 10. 91 % to 25. 42 %), depression (10. 31 %, 3. 66 % to 17. 17 %), fruit and vegetable consumption (6. 46 %, 0. 15 % to 13. 06 %), diabetes (4. 88 %, 1. 87 % to 7. 98 %), and apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele (7. 11 %, 2. 44 % to 11. 98 %). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing <b>crystallised</b> intelligence and <b>fruit</b> and vegetable consumption and eliminating depression and diabetes {{are likely to have}} the biggest impact on reducing the incidence of dementia, outweighing even the effect of removing the principal known genetic risk factor. Although causal relations cannot be concluded with certainty, the study suggests priorities that may inform public health programmes...|$|R
