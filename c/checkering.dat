Characteristics of the flesh-fly is its 3-segmented antennae. Most holarctic Sarcophagidae vary in size from 4 to 18mm in length (Tropical species can be larger) with black and gray longitudinal stripes on the thorax and <b>checkering</b> on the abdomen. Flesh-flies, being viviparous, frequently give birth to live young on corpses of human and other animals, at any stage of decomposition, from newly dead through to bloated or decaying (though the latter is more common).|$|E

2500|$|A mid-life {{upgrade to}} the Glock pistols {{involved}} {{the addition of}} <b>checkering</b> on the front strap and serrations to the back strap. These versions, introduced in 1988, were informally referred to as [...] "second-generation" [...] models. To meet American ATF regulations, a steel plate with a stamped serial number was embedded into the receiver {{in front of the}} trigger guard.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, the Glock 22 RTF2 (Rough Textured Frame 2) (chambered in [...]40 S) was introduced. This pistol {{featured}} a new <b>checkering</b> texture around the grip and new scalloped (fish gill-shaped) serrations {{at the rear}} of the sides of the slide. Many of the existing models became available in the RTF2 version, including the 31, 32, 23, 21, 19. Some of those did not have the fish gills.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2010 SHOT Show, Glock {{presented}} the [...] "fourth generation", now dubbed [...] "Gen4" [...] by Glock itself. [...] Updates centered on ergonomics and the recoil spring assembly. Some parts of fourth-generation Glock pistols cannot be interchanged {{with those of}} the previous generations. The initial two fourth-generation models announced were the full-sized Glock 17 and Glock 22, chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum and [...]40 S cartridges, respectively. The pistols were displayed with a modified rough-textured frame, grip <b>checkering,</b> and interchangeable backstraps of different sizes. [...] "Gen4" [...] is rollmarked on the slide next to the model number to identify the fourth-generation pistols.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the standard or [...] "plain finish" [...] model, a deluxe or [...] "fancy finish" [...] model was offered with pistol grip stock and <b>checkering</b> on the forearm and wrist of the stock. The plain finish rifles were offered in 1907 at a list price of $28. That equates to approximately $730 2016 dollars. In 1935, Winchester offered a special [...] "Police Rifle" [...] variant, featuring a non-adjustable rear sight, sling swivels, larger magazine release, and a special barrel measuring 5/8" [...] at the muzzle, and rear sight dovetail moved [...] 2 3/8" [...] inches rearward.

2500|$|Battlefield {{experience}} in World War I {{led to some}} more small external changes, completed in 1924. The new version received a modified type classification, M1911A1, in 1926 with a stipulation that M1911A1s should have serial numbers higher than 700,000 with lower serial numbers designated M1911. The M1911A1 changes to the original design consisted of a shorter trigger, cutouts in the frame behind the trigger, an arched mainspring housing, a longer grip safety spur (to prevent hammer bite), a wider front sight, a shortened hammer spur, and simplified grip <b>checkering</b> (eliminating the [...] "Double Diamond" [...] reliefs). These changes were subtle and largely intended to make the pistol easier to shoot for those with smaller hands. Many persons unfamiliar with the design are often unable {{to tell the difference}} between the two versions at a glance. No significant internal changes were made, and parts remained interchangeable between the M1911 and the M1911A1.|$|E
2500|$|Since its inception, the M1911 has lent {{itself to}} easy customization. [...] Replacement sights, grips, and other {{aftermarket}} accessories {{are the most}} commonly offered parts. [...] Since the 1950s {{and the rise of}} competitive pistol shooting, many companies have been offering the M1911 as a base model for major customization. These modifications can range from changing the external finish, <b>checkering</b> the frame, and hand fitting custom hammers, triggers, and sears. Some modifications include installing compensators and the addition of accessories such as tactical lights and even scopes. A common modification of John Browning's design is to use a full-length guide rod that runs the full length of the recoil spring. This adds weight {{to the front of the}} pistol, but does not increase accuracy, and does make the pistol slightly more difficult to disassemble. Custom guns can cost over $5000 and are built from the ground up or on existing base models. The main companies offering custom M1911s are: Springfield Custom Shop, Ed Brown, STI International, Nighthawk Custom, Wilson Combat, and Les Baer. IPSC models are offered by both Strayer Voigt Inc (Infinity Firearms) and STI International.|$|E

Gradually, in stirring up those old dead pedantic record-books, the fact rises on us: silent whirlwinds of old Platt-Deutsch fire, beautifully held down, dwell in those mute masses; better human stuff there is not than that old Teutsch (Dutch, English, Platt-Deutsch and other varieties); and so disciplined as here it never was before or since.

As the distance increases, the confusion becomes greater, until at last the whole front of the house becomes merely a flat, pale space, in which, however, there is still observable a kind of richness and <b>checkering,</b> caused by the details in it, which, though totally merged and lost in the mass, have still an influence on the texture of that mass; until at last the whole house itself becomes a mere light or dark spot which we can plainly see, but cannot tell what it is, nor distinguish it from a stone or any other object.|$|E

The {{frequent}} {{occurrence of}} the arch is always delightful in distant effect, partly on account of its graceful line, partly because the shade it casts is varied in depth, becoming deeper and deeper as the grotto retires, and partly because it gives great apparent elevation to the walls which it supports. The grottoes themselves are agreeable objects seen near, because they give an impression of coolness to the eye; and they echo all sounds with great melody; small streams are often conducted through them, occasioning slight breezes by their motion. Then the statue and the urn are graceful in their outline, classical in their meaning, and correct in their position, for where could they be more appropriate than here; the one ministering to memory, {{and the other to}} mourning. The terraces themselves are dignified in their character (a necessary effect, as we saw above), and even the formal rows of trees are right in this climate, for a peculiar reason. Effect is always to be considered, in Italy, as if the sun were always to shine, for it does nine days out of ten.

It was the scullery of their little establishment,--the place where all dish-washing and clothes-washing was {{generally}} performed,--but the boards of the floor were white as snow, and the place had the odor of neatness. The open door looked out pleasantly into the deep forest, where {{the waters of the}} cove, now at high tide, could be seen glittering through the trees.

Birds were singing and calling to each other merrily from the green shadows of the forest,--everything had a sylvan fullness and freshness of life. There are moods of mind when the sight of the bloom and freshness of nature affects us painfully, like the want of sympathy in a dear friend. Mara had been all her days a child of the woods; her delicate life had grown up in them like one of their own cool shaded flowers; and there was not a moss, not a fern, not an upspringing thing that waved a leaf or threw forth a flower-bell, that was not a well-known friend to her; she had watched for years its haunts, known the time of its coming and its going, studied its shy and veiled habits, and interwoven with its life each year a portion of her own; and now she looked out into the old mossy woods, with their wavering spots of sun and shadow, with a yearning pain, as if she wanted help or sympathy to come from their silent recesses.|$|E
