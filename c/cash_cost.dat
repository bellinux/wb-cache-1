2500|$|After {{the success}} of the {{oscilloscope}} kit, Heath went on to produce dozens of Heathkit products. Heathkits were influential in shaping two generations of electronic hobbyists. The Heathkit sales premise was that by investing the time to assemble a Heathkit, the purchaser could build something comparable to a factory-built product at a very significantly lower <b>cash</b> <b>cost</b> and, if it malfunctioned, could repair it himself. [...] During those decades, the premise was basically valid. Commercial factory-built electronic products were constructed from generic, discrete components such as vacuum tubes, tube sockets, capacitors, inductors and resistors, and essentially hand-wired and assembled. The home kit-builder could perform these assembly tasks himself, and, if careful, to at least the same standard of quality. In the case of their most expensive product, the Thomas electronic organ, building the Heathkit version represented very substantial savings.|$|E

40|$|Aviation {{guarantees}} mobility, but {{its emissions}} also contribute considerably to climate change. Therefore, climate impact mitigation strategies {{have to be}} developed based on comprehensive assessments of the different impacting factors. We quantify the climate impact mitigation potential and related costs resulting from changes in aircraft operations and design using a multi-disciplinary model workflow. We first analyze the climate impact mitigation potential and <b>cash</b> operating <b>cost</b> changes of altered cruise altitudes and speeds for all flights globally operated by the Airbus A 330 - 200 fleet in the year 2006. We find that this globally {{can lead to a}} 42 % reduction in temperature response at a 10 % <b>cash</b> operating <b>cost</b> increase. Based on this analysis, new design criteria are derived for future aircraft that are optimized for cruise conditions with reduced climate impact. The newly-optimized aircraft is re-assessed with the developed model workflow. We obtain additional climate mitigation potential with small to moderate <b>cash</b> operating <b>cost</b> changes due to the aircraft design changes of, e. g., a 32 % and 54 % temperature response reduction for a 0 % and 10 % <b>cash</b> operating <b>cost</b> increase. Hence, replacing the entire A 330 - 200 fleet by this redesigned aircraft (M a c r = 0. 72 and initial cruise altitude (ICA) = 8000 m) could reduce the climate impact by 32 % without an increase of <b>cash</b> operating <b>cost...</b>|$|R

Analysis of the long-run average cost curves {{in combination with the}} 1968 weighted Utah beef price revealed that all four ranch sizes studied are capable of meeting <b>cash</b> <b>costs.</b> If the goal of the ranch operator is to meet both <b>cash</b> <b>costs</b> and depreciation, a cattle ranch supporting 105 breeding cows is the minimum size necessary. If provision is made to cover <b>cash</b> <b>costs</b> and depreciation in addition to receiving a fair return for operator and family labor, the ranch must support at least 360 breeding cows. None of the four ranch sizes studied were capable of meeting all production costs including five per cent interest on investment. The minimum ranch size necessary to cover all production costs including 1. 4 per cent interest on investment is 500 head of breeding cows. Farmer questionnaires and the machine capacity technique provided data from which five long-run average cost curves were derived by connecting points representing average production costs and levels of wheat output for four sizes of wheat farms (500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 acres). The long-run average cost curves were analyzed in combination with the 1968 Utah wheat price. All four wheat farm sizes studied are capable of meeting <b>cash</b> <b>costs.</b> In order to cover both <b>cash</b> <b>costs</b> and depreciation a wheat farm of at least 940 acres is required. The minimum wheat farm size necessary to meet <b>cash</b> <b>costs</b> and depreciation as well as provide a fair return to operator and family labor is 2430 acres. None of the four sizes of wheat farms studied was large enough to cover all costs including interest on investment at five per cent. In order to cover all production costs including 0, 64 per cent interest on investment a wheat farm of at least 3000 acres is required, Costs and returns to five management alternatives for marginal Utah cropland ((1) wheat production by owner-operator, (2) leasing crop [...] land to tenants for dryland wheat production, (3) leasing forage on an AUM basis, (4) leasing of forage on a livestock gain basis, and (5) stocker cattle production by the land owner) were compared in the shortrun, in the long-run assuming that all inputs were variable, and in the long-run assuming that land and operator and family labor were fixed, For the marginal cropland owner who also owns wheat production factors, wheat production on an owner-operator basis is the most favorable short-run alternative. Wheat production on a tenant basis is the only short-run alternative open to cropland owners who own neither wheat production factors nor the improvements necessary for grazing enterprises. Leasing forage on a livestock gain basis is the most favorable short-run alternative for cropland owners whose holdings are equipped with grazing improvements. For the long-run situation in which all inputs were considered variable, all five management alternatives yielded negative returns. Under such conditions a rational land owner would refuse to choose from among the five alternatives studied and would instead liquidate his land holdings. When operator and family labor and land were considered fixed, leasing cropland to tenants for dryland wheat production proved to be the most favorable long-run management alternative. Showing the second highest internal rate of return was leasing forage on a livestock gain basis followed ~ stocker cattle production by the land owner. Wheat production ~ the land owner and leasing forage on an AUM basis proved to be the least favorable long-run management alternatives on marginal cropland...|$|R
