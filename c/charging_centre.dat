40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we attempt to}} show that the {{necessary}} condition to create a lightning ground flash is the generation of a vertical conducting channel below the main negative <b>charge</b> <b>centre.</b> The probability of such an event increases if frequent breakdown takes place between the negative <b>charge</b> <b>centre</b> and the lower positive <b>charge</b> <b>centre</b> (LPCC). Analysis of electromagnetic field signatures produced by ground flashes in Sweden show pronounced radiation during the preliminary breakdown process. Such strong pulses are rarely found in tropical thunderstorms in Sri Lanka. We attribute these signatures to preliminary breakdown between the main negative <b>charge</b> <b>centre</b> and the LPCC and argue that meteorological conditions which favour the production of strong LPCC’s {{are more likely to be}} found at mid and high latitudes than in the tropics, thus explaining why there is a greater probability of lightning flashes striking the ground in these regions. 1...|$|R

40|$|Recent dissociative {{recombination}} (DR) experiments {{have reported that}} the observed reaction products depend on the structure, bonding, and <b>charge</b> <b>centre</b> of the molecular ion. For examples, the dominant product channel observed in the DR of D 5 (+) (2), N 2 O 2 (+) (1), and D 5 O 2 (+) (3) suggests that the former two ions have the form D 3 (+) D 2, and NO(+) NO(1), respectively, whilst the latter {{is known to have}} the form D 2 O D(+) D 2 O (3). Here we compare and contrast these observations by investigating the DR of one of the simplest such systems, Li(+) H 2.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of the {{depletion}} charge in the polysilicon gate on electron mobility in ultrathin oxide MOSFETs. An improved theory for remote-charge-scattering-limited mobility in silicon inversion layers is developed. The model takes into account the effects of image charges, screening, inversion layer quantization, the contribution of different subbands, oxide thickness, the actual distribution of <b>charged</b> <b>centres</b> inside the structure, the actual distribution of carriers in the inversion layer, the correlation of <b>charged</b> <b>centres</b> and the <b>charged</b> <b>centre</b> sign. It is shown that if the oxide is thin enough the remote Coulomb scattering due to the depletion charge in the poly-gate becomes an effective scattering mechanism, whose effect is comparable to those of the main scattering mechanisms that control the movement of the carriers in the MOSFET channel. As a consequence, this scattering mechanism {{must be taken into account}} in order to satisfactorily explain the experimental results obtained in ultrathin oxide MOSFETs. The model is implemented in a Monte Carlo simulator, where the effects of the ionized impurity charge in the substrate, the interface trapped charge and the contribution of other scattering mechanisms are taken into account simultaneously. Our results show that RCS cannot be neglected for oxide thicknesses below 2 nm, but that its effects for tox> 5 nmarenegligible. Good agreement with experimental results was obtained. 1...|$|R

Since the local symmetry of the copper-nitrogen bond is {{perpendicular to the}} molecular symmetry axis, the s. h. f. s. around g, exhibits a linewidth occurrence of the pyrrole nitrogen atoms; this was analysed to yield an accurate anisotropic ligand tensor from which the ligand hybridisation {{was found to be}} sp 2. A detailed analysis of the e. s. r. data yielded B 12 = 0. 74, B 22 = 1, E 2 0. 6. A theoretical line shape analysis of spectra containing common copper points to considerable errors in most of the published work on copper complexes. Other phthalocyanines investigated were the species formed when chromium, iron, nickel, copper and metal-free phthalocyanines are reduced by sodium in tetrahydrofuran and hexamethylphosphoramide. Hyperfine structure attributable to the interaction of a single unpaired electron with four equivalent nitrogen nuclei was observed in reduced iron phthalocyanine; in reduced chromium phthalocyanine both chromium and nitrogen h. f. s. were observed. The results of the investigation are compared with those for related systems and are systematised in terms of a general energy level scheme. A general study of vanadyl complexes showed that good correlations can be drawn between e. s. r. and optical parameters and the total covalency of the complex, rather than merely upon the covalency of the orbital containing the unpaired electron. The methods are extrapolated to study the nature of the major interactions occurring between certain transition-metal complexes and a wide variety of pure solvents, rationalised mainly in terms of solvent-induced perturbations upon the spectral properties of the complex. In vanadyl bisacetylacetonate the principle solvent interactions are found to be axial sigma (rather than pi) bonding between the negative <b>charge</b> <b>centre</b> of the solvent dipole and the vanadium atom, and hydrogen-bonding between the solvent positive <b>charge</b> <b>centre</b> and the pi clouds localised around the vanadyl oxygen atom.

40|$|The {{definitive}} version may {{be found}} at www. wiley. comThe collision induced decompositions of 3 -substituted adamantane carboxylate anions have been studied {{with a view to}} uncovering charge-remote fragmentations of the 3 -substituent. The 3 -substituent is chosen so that it cannot approach the anion site, and so any fragmentations of that substituent should proceed independently of the <b>charged</b> <b>centre,</b> viz. charge-remote reactions. The following systems have been studied (i) the 3 -cyclohexenyl system shows no charge-remote retro Diels-Alder fragmentation (DeltaH = + 157 kJ mol(- 1)), instead, charge-remote loss of the cyclohexenyl radical is noted, (ii) the 3 -isobutyl ketone system shows no Norrish II cleavage (loss of C(3) H(6), DeltaH = + 18 kJ mol(- 1)), instead, the competitive losses of CO(2) from the <b>charged</b> carboxyl <b>centre,</b> together with charge-remote radical loss of the 3 -substituent are observed, and (iii) the corresponding 3 -isopropyl ester does show the "Norrish II" loss of C(3) H(6), together with competitive losses of CO(2) and the 3 -substituent.
