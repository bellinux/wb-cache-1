40|$|An {{emulsion}} is {{a mixture}} of two or more immiscible liquids. Many daily l ife products like for example food products, cosmetics, paints and pharm aceutical products are in fact emulsions. In addition, polymer blends, t hat are generally solid at room temperature, form a very viscous emulsio n during processing in the melt. The properties of emulsions and polymer blends are not only dependent on the characteristics of the components and on their concentration, but they are also strongly dependent on the microstructure, also called the morphology. As a consequence, when desig ning such multiphasic materials, it is essential to control the morpholo gy in order to obtain a material with the desired properties. Different types of morphology are possible, the most common is the droplet-matrix morphology. However, also fibrillar, laminar and co-continuous morpholog ies can be obtained. This work will focus on the droplet-matrix morpholo gy. For this type of morphology the final microstructure is the result o f a complex interplay between two processes: breakup of one droplet in t wo or more daughter droplets and coalescence, which is the merging of tw o droplets resulting in one bigger droplet. In the past, a great deal of research has already been performed on droplet breakup. However, since the coalescence process involves the interaction of two droplets it is a n inherently more complex process and many aspects of droplet coalescenc e remain unexplored up to now. The use of microfluidic devices is emerging in a variety of applications. In many cases multiphasic materials have to be transported through the se devices. If this is the case, the size of the droplets of the dispers ed phase can become comparable to the dimensions of the channel, which i s called confinement. In confined conditions, deviations from bulk behav ior can be expected. The dynamics of a single droplet in confined condit ions are relatively well understood. However, the effects of confinement on droplet coalescence are largely unexplored. In order to fully unders tand the effects of confinement, morphology development in confined shea r flow is often studied as a model type problem. In the present work, the effects of geometrical confinement on droplet c oalescence are investigated. In addition, the effects of the viscosity r atio of the dropletmatrix system and of the initial offset of the drople t pair are explored. In a final part of this research the effects of con finement on droplet collisions that do not result in coalescence are stu died. A home-built counter rotating parallel plate device is used to vis ualize the droplet pair during the interaction. Before the start of the experimental work some modifications to this device were made in order t o facilitate the experiments. A new needle positioning device, needle ho lder and microscope positioning device were designed and constructed. Mo reover, a new injection protocol was implemented, which, in combination with the previously mentioned modifications, allows for visualization of the droplet injection. The model materials used for this study are poly dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as a droplet phase and polyisobutylene (PIB) as a matrix phase. Both materials are Newtonian and liquid at room temperat ure. Three different grades of PIB with three different viscosities are used to vary the ratio of droplet to matrix viscosity. A new type of trajectory occurring due to confinement was discovered. At small initial offsets the offset decreases during approach until it bec omes zero, after which the droplets reverse their direction of movement and separate again. The cause of these reversing trajectories are large recirculation zones in the front and the rear of the droplet pair induce d by confinement. These reversing trajectories induce a lower boundary f or the initial offset, below which no coalescence occurs, but instead, t he droplets reverse direction. This lower boundary is found to be indepe ndent of the Ca number (at least if the droplet deformat ion remains small), but it increases with increasing confinement ratio a nd droplet size. Apart from this lower boundary, confinement also increa ses the initial offset up to which coalescence is possible. Moreover, co nfinement decreases the coalescence angle. The lower coalescence angle a nd higher upper initial offset boundary can be explained by means of the droplet trajectories. Two effects of confinement are important in expla ining the promotion of coalescence due to confinement. First, it is obse rved that due to the recirculation zones in confined conditions the offs et decreases during approach of the droplets. As a consequence, for the same initial offset the offset at apparent contact is lower in confined conditions in comparison with bulk conditions. This contributes to the l ower coalescence angle because of the following three reasons: film drai nage can already start at a lower angle; at a smaller angle the rotation speed is lower, which increases the contact time; due to the previous t wo reasons the droplet pair spends more time at low angles, where the fo rce pushing the droplets together is lower, which results in a smaller f ilm drainage area and hence, a faster film drainage. Second, also for th e same offset at apparent contact a droplet pair in confined conditions rotates slower than in bulk conditions. This will further increase the t otal contact time and also the time the droplet pair spends at lower ang les for which film drainage is faster. Nevertheless, due to confinement additional hydrodynamic wall forces are present during the complete inte raction process, which counteract the effect of the lower hydrodynamic f orce which is present because the droplet pairs in confinement spend mor e time at lower orientation angles. However, the net result of confineme nt is still a lower coalescence angle and higher upper initial offset bo undary. Finally, it can be concluded that confinement induces a lower in itial offset boundary and increases the upper initial offset boundary. T he net result of confinement is a systematical increase in the coalescen ce efficiency. The effects of confinement are similar for viscosity ratios around 1, lo wer than 1 and above 1. For low confinement ratios, the critical capilla ry number remains the same as compared to that in bulk conditions for th e three viscosity ratios. However, above a confinement ratio of 0. 2, a s ubstantially higher critical capillary number is found. Furthermore, for all three viscosity ratios, confinement makes coalescence possible up t o higher initial offsets. On the other hand, confinement also induces a lower boundary for the initial offset below which the offset decreases t o zero during approach of the droplets after which the droplets reverse without coalescence. Finally, for all initial offsets confinement decrea ses the coalescence angle. Although the qualitative effects of confineme nt are similar for the different viscosity ratios, there is a quantitati ve difference between the viscosity ratios. With increasing viscosity ra tio, coalescence becomes more difficult. This results in lower critical <b>Ca</b> <b>numbers</b> and lower upper initial offset boundaries for the systems with higher viscosity ratios. Moreover, the coalescence ang le decreases with increasing viscosity ratio. The reason for this more d ifficult coalescence is twofold. First, the mobility of the interface de creases with increasing viscosity ratio, which results in a more difficu lt film drainage. Second, the approach trajectories depend on the viscos ity ratio. As a result, for the higher viscosity ratios the two droplets make apparent contact at a higher offset. Moreover, it is found that th e lower initial offset boundary, below which the droplets reverse, decre ases with viscosity ratio. The reason is a difference in trajectory betw een the different viscosity ratios, i. e. for the higher viscosity ratios there can be a minimum in the offset versus horizontal distance curve. This is most probably caused by the larger tangential stress present at the droplet interface for the droplets with higher viscosity ratios, whi ch increases the tendency of the droplets to be pulled over each other o nce they approach to a sufficiently close distance. Finally, the effects of confinement on droplet interactions that do not result in coalescence are studied. To ensure that no coalescence occurs, two relatively large <b>Ca</b> <b>numbers</b> are selected: 0. 02 and 0. 2. Whereas at Ca number 0. 02 the droplets are still al most spherical, at Ca number 0. 2 there is a significant droplet deformat ion and the droplets have a more or less ellipsoidal shape. As a consequ ence, at Ca number 0. 02 the deviation from the hard sphere rotation is r ather small, whereas at Ca number 0. 2 the deviation from the hard sphere rotation is relatively large. Moreover, the large defor mation at Ca number 0. 2 hinders the reversing of droplets in confined co nditions. Similar to the droplet collisions at smaller <b>Ca</b> <b>numbers,</b> a clear effect of confinement on the droplet trajectories is present. While in bulk conditions there is always an increase in offset during approach, in confined conditions the increase in offset is much s maller or often there is a decrease in offset during approach. As a cons equence, the rotation of the droplet pair is much slower in confined con ditions in comparison with a collision in bulk conditions with the same initial offset. At Ca number 0. 2 the droplet deformation is significant. Hence, at this Ca number the effect of confinement and initial offset on the droplet deformation can be studied. The deformation parameter {{as a function of the}} orientation angle of th e droplet pair shows a complex transient. Before interaction the deforma tion is equal to the steady state deformation of a single droplet. Durin g approach the deformation increases and goes through a first maximum. W hen the droplets are being pulled apart, the deformation goes through a minimum and a second maximum. When the droplets are separated far enough the initial value of the droplet deformation is regained. It can be con cluded that the first maximum in the deformation decreases with increasi ng initial offset and increases due to confinement. The decrease with in creasing initial offset can be explained by the fact that for a higher i nitial offset the amount of contact decreases. Since the first maximum i n the deformation is caused by the two droplets being pushed together, l ess contact will result in a smaller maximum deformation. The larger def ormation due to confinement can be explained by the larger hydrodynamic force pushing the droplets together. At Ca number 0. 02 t he final offset after separation is almost independent of the initial of fset and the confinement ratio. On the other hand, at Ca number 0. 2 the final offset in bulk conditions increases with increasin g initial offset. In confined conditions also at Ca numb er 0. 2 the final offset is independent of the initial offset. Moreover, at Ca number 0. 2 it is clear that this final offset is smaller due to confinement. Finally, it is observed that an increase in Ca number from 0. 02 to 0. 2 decreases the final offset inc onfined conditions. It can be concluded that this work provides a fundamental insight in the effects of confinement, viscosity ratio and initial offset on droplet c oalescence. Moreover, these effects are qualitatively explained with the help of simulations and a thorough investigation of the droplet traject ories. Furthermore, a valuable data set of droplet coalescence is collec ted. This data set can serve as a guidance for future development and va lidation of more accurate 3 D numerical simulations of droplet coalescenc e both in bulk and confined conditions. status: publishe...|$|E

It studies the area of a northern part of the Poľana UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) Biosphere reserve that represents mountain agricultural landscape. All of the analyses were realised in GIS (geographic information systems), based on the orthophotos that represented the land use structure in 1949, 1986 and 2006. Dramatic decrease in real usage of agricultural areas attended by the process of secondary succession was observed especially in steep slopes and higher altitude levels. To quantify the changes, landscape metrics such as class area (<b>CA),</b> <b>number</b> of patches (NP) and mean patch size (MPS) were used. Changes in landscape classes had an influence on landscape diversity. It was expressed by decrease in Shannon‘s diversity index (SDI) and Shannon‘s evenness index (SEI) ...|$|R
40|$|Genomic {{abnormalities}} at 348 loci encoding {{genes that}} {{may contribute to}} lung cancer transformation and progression were assessed using array comparative genomic hybridization in 21 squamous carcinomas (SqCas) and 16 adenocarcinomas (AdCas). Hierarchical clustering showed a clear pattern of gains and losses for the SqCas, whereas the pattern for AdCas was less distinct. Cross-validated classification using a K-nearest-neighbor assigned, on average, 32 of 37 samples to their proper histological subtype. The most noticeable differences between SqCas and AdCas were gain of chromosome 3 q 22 -q 26 and loss of chromosome 3 p. These occurred almost exclusively in SqCas. The region of recurrent increase is 30 Mb in extent, ranging from EVI 1 to TFRC. PIK 3 CA, the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), is in this region. The PIK 3 <b>CA</b> copy <b>number</b> increase was validated using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} to lung cancer tissue microarrays. Activity of the downstream PI 3 K effector protein kinase B (PKB) was higher in SqCas than in AdCas and was correlated with PIK 3 <b>CA</b> copy <b>number</b> (r 0. 75), suggesting that these copy number increases contribute to activation of PI 3 K signaling in SqCas of the lung...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a counter}} {{rotating}} parallel plate shear flow cell, the shape relaxation of deformed droplets in a quiescent matrix is studied microscopically. Both {{the effects of}} geometrical confinement and component viscoelasticity are systematically explored at viscosity ratios of 0. 45 and 1. 5. The flow conditions are varied from a rather low to a nearly critical <b>Ca</b> <b>number.</b> Under all conditions investigated, viscoelasticity of the droplet phase has no influence on shape relaxation, whereas matrix viscoelasticity and geometrical confinement result in a slower droplet retraction. Up to high confinement ratios, the relaxation curves for ellipsoidal droplets can be superposed onto a master curve. Confined droplets with a sigmoidal shape relax in two stages: the first consists of a shape change to an ellipsoid with {{a limited amount of}} retraction, and the second is the retraction of this ellipsoid. The latter stage can be described by means of one single relaxation time that can be obtained from the relaxation of initially ellipsoidal droplets. The experimental results are compared to the predictions of a recently published phenomenological model for droplet dynamics in confined systems with viscoelastic components (Minale et al., Langmuir 26 : 126 – 132, 2010). However, whereas the model predicts additive effects of geometrical confinement and component viscoelasticity, the experimental data reveal more complex interactions...|$|R
