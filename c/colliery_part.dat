50|$|Wharncliffe Woodmoor 1, 2 and 3 <b>colliery</b> (<b>part</b> of Wharncliffe Woodmoor Colliery Company Ltd, the Wharncliffe Woodmoor Colliery Company {{was formed}} in 1873 when it {{purchased}} the New Willey Colliery, which had been sunk in 1871)was a coal mine that was located at the junction of Laithes Lane and Carlton Road, about 2 miles northeast of Barnsley, South Yorkshire and a quarter mile east of Staincross and Mapplewell railway station, on the Great Central Railway. The branch line junction was about 200 feet from Staincross that connected it to the colliery via a private line. The line finished up between the three main shafts and the coking ovens.|$|E
50|$|Various {{locations}} around Fife were {{looked at}} {{which included the}} former Crail Aerodrome, Lochore Meadows, Bowhill <b>Colliery,</b> <b>part</b> of the former Auctertool branch line, the former Wemyss Private Railway site at Scott's Road and even the former Kilconquhar railway station, all of which proven unsuitable for various reasons. Finally in 2001, the society acquired Kirkland Yard, a former 21 acre railway marshalling yard {{on the outskirts of}} Leven and in 2003, the rolling stock was moved from the Power Station to their new home. Since then the KFRPS have since constructed half a mile of track plus substantial sidings, along with a two lane engine shed which is used for restoration work.|$|E
50|$|Minnie Pit, {{which was}} named after Minnie Craig, the {{daughter}} {{of one of the}} owners, a Mr. W.Y. Craig, was opened in 1881 in the small village of Halmer End, Newcastle-under-Lyme. At 359 yd deep, it {{had been one of the}} most profitable pits in the North Staffordshire coalfields because it mined five seams of thick, good quality coal. It was the downcast shaft for the Podmore Hall <b>Colliery,</b> <b>part</b> of a wider industrial business that mined coal at the Burley Pit - the principal winding pit - on the Podmore Hall site, near Apedale. The business also included an ironworks, forge and coking ovens at Apedale. In 1890, the entire combine was formed into the Midland Coal, Coke and Iron Company, Ltd. and apart from mining and iron making, the combine company had its own mineral railway, the Apedale and Podmore Hall Railway.|$|E
50|$|After 1929 the <b>colliery</b> became <b>part</b> of Manchester <b>Collieries</b> and its railway was {{connected}} to the Astley and Tyldesley Collieries railway system between Nook and Gin Pit collieries. Manchester Collieries made improvements including new headgear and screens. The <b>colliery</b> became <b>part</b> of the National Coal Board in 1947. It closed in 1967 having employed 518 underground and 131 surface workers.|$|R

50|$|In 1932 Bwllfa and Cwmaman <b>Collieries,</b> <b>part</b> of the Welsh Associated Collieries, {{took control}} of Mardy. After WAC merged with the coal {{interests}} of Powell Duffryn in 1935 to form Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Limited, the colliery was completely closed, {{with the loss of}} 1,000 jobs: 120 on the surface, 880 underground. Reopeneing in 1938, it was greatly affected by the suspension of coal exports to Europe at the start of World War II, and hence closed in 1940.|$|R
50|$|The line {{begins at}} Newcraighall South Junction where the track veers off the former Waverley Route to a {{parallel}} alignment {{just to the}} west which crosses over the former Monktonhall <b>Colliery,</b> <b>part</b> of the Midlothian Coalfield. The first of three double-track dynamic loops begins here and continues for 2.1 mi to King's Gate Junction just beyond the Edinburgh Bypass. The new alignment - some 600 m to the south-west of the original route - avoids new roads and mining subsidence on the Waverley Route trackbed through Millerhill, whilst also serving new housing at Shawfair. There is a maximum speed limit on the Shawfair loop of 60 mph, with restrictions of 40 mph at the northern entrance to the loop and 55 mph at King's Gate. A new bridge carries the Edinburgh bypass across the double-track.

50|$|Talks {{about the}} {{resumption}} of passenger operation on the Brampton Town branch continued at this time, with the North Eastern Railway being the obvious choice of operator now. However the Earl of Carlisle demanded a high rental for the line, and the North Eastern Railway, seeing {{that they would have}} to pay a considerable sum for modernising the line and that income would be limited, did not conclude a deal. The Earl of Carlisle died in 1912, and shortly after his death a 50-year lease on satisfactory terms was concluded with the Dowager Duchess. Track upgrading, a bridge reconstruction, and new goods shed facilities were completed and an opening ceremony for the upgraded line took place on 31 July 1913; the public passenger service started the following day, 1 August 1913. A Fletcher 0-4-4 tank engine, no. 1089, was allocated to the service, operating between two coaches as a push-and-pull train. The Westinghouse brake system was used. The line from Brampton Junction to Brampton was now in separate hands from the <b>colliery</b> <b>part</b> of the network, and coal from the pits to Brampton was exchanged at the junction.|$|E

The pithead bath house built by the Miner's Welfare Committee in the 1930s survived and was converted to other uses. The pit {{was the subject of}} a painting by local artist, Roger Hampson.|$|R
50|$|Pithead {{baths and}} an {{administration}} block were built around 1937 and surface buildings upgraded between 1943 and 1946.

In 1978 the colliery employed 230 men winning 4,000 tons of coal per week from the Beeston Seam. The coal reserves were exhausted by 1985 and the colliery closed. It reopened as the Yorkshire Mining Museum in 1988.|$|R
5000|$|In 1945 {{the mining}} {{portfolio}} was increased with {{the purchase of}} the [...] Shireoaks Colliery Company, the colliery being just over the Nottinghamshire border. As with all their <b>collieries</b> this became <b>part</b> of the National Coal Board in 1947.|$|R
