25|$|Another type of device {{people use}} {{to help their}} recall memory become {{efficient}} <b>chunking.</b> <b>Chunking</b> {{is the process of}} breaking down numbers into smaller units to remember the information or data, this helps recall numbers and math facts. An example of this <b>chunking</b> process is a telephone number; this is chunked with three digits, three digits, then four digits. People read them off as such when reciting a phone number to another person. There has been research done about these techniques and an institution tested two groups of people to see if these types of devices work well for real people, the results came back determining a significant performance difference between the group who did not use cognitive strategies and the group who did. The group using the techniques immediately performed better than the other group and when taking a pre-test and post-test the results indicated that the group using the techniques improved while the other group did not.|$|E
25|$|Pumpkin <b>chunking</b> is a {{competitive}} {{activity in which}} teams build various mechanical devices designed to throw a pumpkin as far as possible. Catapults, trebuchets, ballistas and air cannons {{are the most common}} mechanisms. Some pumpkin chunkers breed and grow special varieties of pumpkin under specialized conditions to improve the pumpkin's chances of surviving a throw.|$|E
30|$|Existing <b>chunked</b> {{codes are}} in two categories: {{overlapped}} <b>chunked</b> codes and coded <b>chunked</b> codes. In overlapped <b>chunked</b> codes, the <b>chunks</b> are subsets of the input packets with possibly non-empty intersections. The first several designs of <b>chunked</b> codes all belong to this category. However, the existing designs of overlapped <b>chunks</b> are mostly based on heuristics, and no rigorous performance analysis {{is available for}} the existing designs [10 – 12]. In coded <b>chunked</b> codes, <b>chunks</b> are generated by combining multiple input packets. By generalizing fountain codes and LDPC codes, nearly throughput optimal <b>chunked</b> codes have been designed, including BATS code [13, 14], Gamma code [15, 16], and L-chunked (LC) code [17]. Overlapped <b>chunks</b> {{can be viewed as}} a degraded class of coded <b>chunks</b> where <b>chunks</b> are generated using certain repetition codes.|$|R
50|$|To {{facilitate}} fault tolerance, each <b>chunk</b> is replicated onto multiple (default, three) <b>chunk</b> servers. A <b>chunk</b> {{is available}} {{on at least one}} <b>chunk</b> server. The advantage of this scheme is simplicity. The master is responsible for allocating the <b>chunk</b> servers for each <b>chunk</b> and is contacted only for metadata information. For all other data, the client has to interact with the <b>chunk</b> servers.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the article}} was to develop Mandarin {{vocabulary}} teaching material for Indonesian people and foreigners. Teaching material was developed by cutting vocabulary, called <b>Chunk</b> theory. Article clarified <b>Chunk</b> theory, basic strategy of teaching <b>Chunk</b> theory, and the basic idea of teaching <b>Chunk</b> theory; gave opinions and some important factors related to <b>Chunk</b> theory. It can be concluded {{that there is a}} significant factor in teaching <b>Chunk</b> theory, that is, a meaning transformation process to different context. It can be more (<b>Chunk</b> Up), less (<b>Chunk</b> Down), and similar (<b>Chunk</b> Laterally) ...|$|R
25|$|The {{results of}} this study {{indicate}} that the taxi drivers' (experts') recall of streets was higher in both the route order condition and the map order condition than in the two random conditions. This indicates that the experts were able to use their prelearned spatial knowledge to organize the information in such a way that they surpassed STM and WM capacity limitations. The organization strategy that the drivers employed is known as <b>chunking.</b> Additionally, the comments made by the experts during the procedure point towards their use of route knowledge in completing the task. To ensure that it was in fact spatial information that they were encoding, the researchers also presented lists in alphabetical order and semantic categories. However, the researchers found that it was in fact spatial information that the experts were <b>chunking,</b> allowing them to surpass the limitations of both visuo-spatial STM and WM.|$|E
25|$|More recent {{research}} has extended established findings of age related decline in executive functioning, by examining related cognitive processes that underlie healthy older adults’ sequential performance. Sequential performance refers to the execution of a series steps needed to complete a routine, such as the steps required to make {{a cup of coffee}} or drive a car. An important part of healthy aging involves older adults’ use of memory and inhibitory processes to carry out daily activities in a fixed order without forgetting the sequence of steps that were just completed while remembering {{the next step in the}} sequence. A recent study examined how young and older adults differ in the underlying representation of a sequence of tasks and their efficiency at retrieving the information needed to complete their routine. Findings from this study revealed that when older and young adults had to remember a sequence of 8 animal images arranged in a fixed order, both age groups spontaneously used the organizational strategy of <b>chunking</b> to facilitate retrieval of information. However, older adults were slower at accessing each chunk compared to younger adults, and were better able to benefit from the use of memory aids, such as verbal rehearsal to remember the order of the fixed sequence. Results from this study suggest that there are age differences in memory and inhibitory processes that affect people’s sequence of actions and the use of memory aids could facilitate the retrieval of information in older age.|$|E
25|$|Experts have {{tremendous}} experience through practice and {{education in a}} particular field. Musical experts {{use some of the}} same strategies as do many experts in fields that require large amounts of memorization: <b>chunking,</b> organization and practice. For example, musical experts may organize notes into scales or create a hierarchical retrieval scheme to facilitate retrieval from long term memory. In a case study on an expert pianist, researchers Chaffin & Imreh (2002) found that a retrieval scheme was developed to guarantee that the music was recalled with ease. This expert used auditory and motor memory along with conceptual memory. Together the auditory and motor representations allow for automaticity during performance, whereas the conceptual memory is mainly used to mediate when the piece is getting off track. When studying concert soloists, Chaffin and Logan (2006) reiterate that a hierarchical organization exists in memory, but also take this a step further suggesting that they actually use a mental map of the piece allowing them {{to keep track of the}} progression of the piece. Chaffin and Logan (2006) also demonstrate that there are performance cues that monitor the automatic aspects of performance and adjust them accordingly. They distinguish between basic performance cues, interpretive performance cues, and expressive performance cues. Basic cues monitor technical features, interpretive cues monitor changes made in different aspects of the piece, and expressive cues monitor the feelings of the music. These cues are developed when experts pay attention to a particular aspect during practice.|$|E
50|$|SCTP {{applications}} {{submit their}} {{data to be}} transmitted in messages (groups of bytes) to the SCTP transport layer. SCTP places messages and control information into separate <b>chunks</b> (data <b>chunks</b> and control <b>chunks),</b> each identified by a <b>chunk</b> header. The protocol can fragment a message into a number of data <b>chunks,</b> but each data <b>chunk</b> contains data from only one user message. SCTP bundles the <b>chunks</b> into SCTP packets. The SCTP packet, which is submitted to the Internet Protocol, consists of a packet header, SCTP control <b>chunks</b> (when necessary), followed by SCTP data <b>chunks</b> (when available).|$|R
50|$|If {{the file}} is {{strictly}} larger than one <b>chunk</b> size, {{a series of}} <b>chunks</b> at file offsets of 2n MiB (n ≥ 0) and one <b>chunk</b> {{right at the end}} of the file are hashed using a CRC32 (polynomial 0xEDB88320 reversed, 0x04C11DB7 normal). The last <b>chunk</b> of the power-of-two series ends strictly more than one <b>chunk</b> size before the end of the file, i.e. there is always at least one unread byte between the last two <b>chunks</b> (if there are that many <b>chunks).</b> The end-of-file <b>chunk</b> may be shorter than one <b>chunk</b> size; it starts at or after one <b>chunk</b> size into the file. The CRC is initialized using smallhash and stored into smallhash.|$|R

25|$|Considered to be {{a mental}} {{workspace}} enabling temporary storage and retrieval of information, working memory {{is crucial to}} problem-solving and analysis of different situations. Working memory capacity {{is a measure of}} the number of mental processing functions one is able to perform consecutively. Increases in one's working memory capacity can be accomplished with a strategy known as <b>chunking.</b> Aritake et al. conducted a finger sequence tapping experiment in which the subjects were shown coloured dots in sequence on a monitor corresponding to buttons on their keyboard. When a colour was shown the subject had to react by pressing the right colour on the keyboard. The subjects were separated into three groups. Group one continually trained with no periods of sleep. Group two was trained and retested over ten hours of wakefulness followed by eight hours of sleep and final testing. The third group was trained at ten pm, followed by an eight-hour sleep. This group was then tested the following morning and again later in the same day. Results displayed that wakefulness was an insignificant predictor of performance improvement, unless followed by a period of sleep. Groups that were allowed a post training sleep period, regardless of its time in reference to training, was beneficial to the improvement on the finger tapping sequences. The initial working memory capacity of the groups averaged three to four units. In groups two and three the working memory capacity was increased to an average of 5–6 units. It was proposed that sleep-dependent improvements may contribute to overall improvement in working memory capacity leading to improved fluid intelligence.|$|E
500|$|Miller's 1967 work, The Psychology of Communication, was a {{collection}} of seven previously published articles. The first [...] "Information and Memory" [...] dealt with <b>chunking,</b> presenting the idea of separating physical length (the number of items presented to be learned) and psychological length (the number of ideas the recipient manages to categorize and summarize the items with). Capacity of short-term memory was measured in units of psychological length, arguing against a pure behaviorist interpretation since meaning of items, beyond reinforcement and punishment, was central to psychological length.|$|E
500|$|His {{family had}} lived in Ontario for generations. His parents, the Reverend Charles and Gertrude Jolliffe, were missionaries for the Methodist Church of Canada, and were living near what was then known as Luchow, China. He was born at the Canadian Missionary {{hospital}} in Luchow, near <b>Chunking</b> on March 2, 1909. He was home-schooled in China by his mother until his early teens. When his family returned to Ontario, he attend Rockwood Public School {{and then went to}} high school at Guelph Collegiate Institute. He was an undergraduate at the University of Toronto's Victoria College, the United Church College. He became the head of the Victoria Student Council, and {{was a member of the}} Hart House Debates Committee. In 1930, he won the Maurice Cody scholarship, and then became one of Ontario's Rhodes Scholars that same year. He attended Oxford University for three years, and was affiliated with its Christ Church College. As a member of Oxford's Labour Club, he met David Lewis, the club's leader and a fellow Canadian. [...] Together they fought the Communist Red October club and fascists such as Lord Haw-Haw–William Joyce. Both he and Lewis planned [...] a 'silent' protest at Joyce's February 1934 speech at Oxford. [...] They carefully made sure that enough members from the Labour Club attended the meeting, and then in groups of two or three, strategically walked out of the speech, across the creaking wooden floors, effectively blotting out Joyce's speech. [...] The Blackshirts in the audience then caused riots in the street after the meeting and Jolliffe and Lewis were in the thick of it.|$|E
50|$|Consider a Bubblesort, where {{adjacent}} {{records are}} swapped {{in order to}} get them into the right order, so that records appear to “bubble” up and down through the dataspace. If this has to be done in <b>chunks,</b> then when we have sorted all the records in <b>chunk</b> 1, we move on to <b>chunk</b> 2, but we find that some of the records in <b>chunk</b> 1 need to “bubble through” <b>chunk</b> 2, and vice versa (i.e., there are records in <b>chunk</b> 2 that belong in <b>chunk</b> 1, and records in <b>chunk</b> 1 that belong in <b>chunk</b> 2 or later <b>chunks).</b> This will cause the <b>chunks</b> to be read and written back to disk many times as records cross over the boundaries between them, resulting in a considerable degradation of performance. If the data can all be held in memory as one large <b>chunk,</b> then this performance hit is avoided.|$|R
25|$|A <b>chunk</b> {{consists}} of four parts: length (4 bytes, big-endian), <b>chunk</b> type/name (4 bytes), <b>chunk</b> data (length bytes) and CRC (cyclic redundancy code/checksum; 4 bytes). The CRC is a network-byte-order CRC-32 computed over the <b>chunk</b> type and <b>chunk</b> data, but not the length.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{predefined}} group <b>chunks,</b> {{with type}} IDs , [...] and [...] A [...] <b>chunk</b> {{is like a}} record structure, containing a type ID (indicating the record type) followed by nested <b>chunks</b> specifying the record fields. A [...] is a factoring structure containing a series of [...] (property) <b>chunks</b> plus nested group <b>chunks</b> to which those properties apply. A [...] is just a collection of nested <b>chunks</b> with no special semantics. Group <b>chunks</b> can contain other group <b>chunks,</b> depending {{on the needs of}} the application. Group <b>chunks,</b> like their simpler counterparts, contain a length element. Skipping over a group can thus be done with a simple Unix-style relative seek operation.|$|R

2500|$|Many works {{discussing}} {{the art of}} memory {{emphasize the importance of}} brevitas and divisio, or the breaking up of a long series into more manageable sets. This is reflected in advice on forming images or groups of images which can be taken in at a single glance, as well as in [...] discussions of memorizing lengthy passages, [...] "A long text must always be broken up into short segments, numbered, then memorized a few pieces at a time." [...] This is known in modern terminology as <b>chunking.</b>|$|E
2500|$|For a time, it {{appeared}} {{likely that the}} situation would precipitate an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when inflammatory reports of insulting treatment by the Japanese of British subjects attempting to enter or leave the concession appeared in the British press. British public opinion was especially offended by reports of British women forced to strip in public at bayonet point by Japanese soldiers, {{which led to a}} flood of [...] "Yellow Peril" [...] stereotypes being widely invoked in the British media. British Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes considered the situation to be tantamount to a declaration of war. At the time, Tientsin had a population of approximately 1500 British subjects (half of whom were soldiers) and was a major centre for British trade in northern China. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain considered the crisis to be so important that he ordered the Royal Navy to give greater attention to a possible war with Japan than to a war with Germany. Within Japan, the media, the Army and various right-wing groups waged a violent anti-British propaganda campaign in the summer of 1939. [...] Much to the pleasure of the Japanese right, the Home Minister Kōichi Kido did nothing to restrain them in their anti-British media offensive. Encouraging the Japanese in their confrontation {{was the fact that the}} Japanese had broken the American diplomatic codes, and were aware from reading intercepted reports from the American embassies in <b>Chunking</b> and Tokyo that the British had asked for American support and had been refused. The message from Nelson Johnson, the American ambassador to China that any sanctions imposed on Japan were likely to cause a war, and advised against sanctions for that reason reinforced the Japanese government in its stance, but also gave an impression of American weakness, that the Americans feared war with Japan and would pay almost any price to avoid it.|$|E

60|$|Slowly {{the bent}} finger relaxed on the trigger. A loon went {{floating}} by the point, all unconscious of danger, with a rippling wake that sent silver reflections glinting across the lake's deep blue. Far overhead soared an eagle, breeze-borne in wide circles, {{looking down on}} his own wide domain, unheeding the man's intrusion. Nearer, a red squirrel barked down his resentment from a giant spruce trunk. Down on my left a heavy splash and a wild, free tumult of quacking told where the black ducks were coming in, as they had done, undisturbed, for generations. Behind me a long roll echoed through the woods--some young cock partridge, whom the warm sun had beguiled into drumming his spring love-call. From the mountain side a cow moose rolled back a startling answer. Close at hand, yet seeming miles away, a chipmunk was <b>chunking</b> sleepily in the sunshine, while a nest of young wood mice were calling their mother in the grass at my feet. And every wild sound did but deepen the vast, wondrous silence of the wilderness.|$|E
60|$|It {{requires}} considerable {{practice to}} acquire full {{mastery of the}} long-hafted ax, but Thurston, who was stout of arm and keen of eye, had managed to earn his bread with it one winter in an Ontario logging camp. When he swung aloft the heavy wedge of steel, it reflected the blast lamp's radiance, making red flashes as it circled round his head. It came down hissing close past his knee. Mattawa Tom's blade crossed it when it rose, and the first white chip leapt up. More chips followed in quick succession until they whirled in one continuous shower, and the razor-edged steel losing definite form became a confused circling brightness, {{in the center of}} which two supple figures swayed and heaved. The red light smiting the faces of the two showed great drops of sweat, the swell of toil-hardened muscles on the corded arms, and the rise of each straining chest. There was not a clash nor a falter, but, flash after flash, the blades came down <b>chunking</b> into the ever-widening notch. Summers had seen sword play in Montreal armories, and had heard the ax clang often on the side of Western firs, but--for Thurston was fighting to stave off ruin--this grim struggle {{in the face of a}} desperate risk surpassed any remembered exhibition of fencers' skill with the steel. The trunk was bending visibly beneath the hewers, the river frothed more at their feet, and the giant logs were rolling, creeping, shocking close behind, ready to plunge forward when the partly severed trunk should yield.|$|E
5000|$|Another way {{understanding}} may aid {{memory is}} {{by reducing the}} amount {{that has to be}} remembered via <b>chunking.</b> <b>Chunking</b> is the process of organizing objects into meaningful wholes. These wholes are then remembered as a unit rather than separate objects. Words are an example of <b>chunking,</b> where instead of simply perceiving letters we perceive and remember their meaningful wholes: words. The use of <b>chunking</b> increases the number of items we are able to remember by creating meaningful [...] "packets" [...] in which many related items are stored as one.|$|E
30|$|A <b>chunk</b> {{is a set}} of packets each {{of which}} is a linear {{combination}} of the input packets, and a <b>chunked</b> code is a collection of <b>chunks.</b> A <b>chunked</b> code is said to be overlapped if its <b>chunks</b> are subsets of the input packets with possibly non-empty overlapping.|$|R
30|$|We propose {{expander}} <b>chunked</b> (EC) codes, {{the first}} class of overlapped <b>chunked</b> codes that has analyzable performance. In an EC code, the overlapping between <b>chunks</b> is generated using a regular graph: each <b>chunk</b> corresponds to a node in the graph and two adjacent <b>chunks</b> share an input packet. EC codes can be encoded causally and share the same belief propagation (BP) decoding of general overlapped <b>chunked</b> codes.|$|R
