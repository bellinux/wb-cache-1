40|$|At CA 1 synapses, {{activation}} of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) {{is required for}} the induction of both long-term potentiation and depression. The basal level of activity of these receptors is controlled by <b>converging</b> <b>cell</b> signals from G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) is implicated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity because it enhances NMDAR responses by stimulating G � s-coupled receptors and protein kinase A (Yaka et al., 2003). However, the major hippocampal PACAP 1 receptor (PAC 1 R) also signals via G � q subunits and protein kinase C (PKC). In CA 1 neurons, we showed that PACAP 38 (1 nM) enhanced synaptic NMDA, and evoked NMDAR, currents in isolated CA 1 neurons via {{activation of}} the PAC 1 R, G � q, and PKC. The signaling was blocked by intracellular applications of the Src inhibitory peptide Src(40 – 58). Immunoblots confirmed that PACAP 38 biochemically activates Src. A G � q pathway is responsible for this Src-dependent PACAP enhancement because it was attenuated in mice lacking expression of phospholipase C � 1, it was blocked by preventing elevations in intracellular Ca 2 �, and it was eliminated by inhibiting either PKC or cell adhesion kinase � [CAK � or Pyk 2 (proline rich tyrosine kinase 2) ]. Peptides that mimic the binding sites for either Fyn or Src on receptor for activated C kinase- 1 (RACK 1) also enhanced NMDAR in CA 1 neurons, but their effects were blocked by Src(40 – 58), implying that Src is the ultimate regulator of NMDARs. RACK 1 serves as a hub for PKC, Fyn, and Src and facilitates the regulation of basal NMDAR activity in CA 1 hippocampal neurons.

30|$|SBDS is {{a highly}} conserved protein in archaea and eukaryotes (Boocock et al., 2006; Shammas et al., 2005). <b>Converging</b> <b>cell</b> biology data on several SBDS homologues, {{including}} yeast (Sdo 1 p) (Lo et al., 2010; Luz et al., 2009; Menne et al., 2007; Moore et al., 2010; Savchenko et al., 2005), mouse (Finch et al., 2011), Dictyostelium discoideum (Wong et al., 2011) and human SDS patient cells (Burwick et al., 2012; Ganapathi et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2011) have implicated a functional role of SBDS in the maturation of the 60 S ribosomal subunit. Specifically, SBDS was proposed to coordinate with elongation factor-like 1 (Efl 1 p) to release eIF 6 (Tif 6 p in yeast), an important 60 S shuttling factor, from late cytoplasmic pre- 60 S particles. Failure in the timely release and recycling of Tif 6 p impairs the subunit joining and subsequent translation initiation (Karbstein, 2013; Miluzio et al., 2009). The structures of SBDS from several species have been resolved (de Oliveira et al., 2010; Finch et al., 2011; Ng et al., 2009; Shammas et al., 2005), which contain three structural domains, I to III (numbered from the N-terminus). The N-terminal domain of SBDS was shown {{to be involved in}} RNA binding (de Oliveira et al., 2010) and domains II-III were found to interact with an insertion domain of Efl 1 p (Asano et al., 2014). Also, recent data revealed a functional link between Sdo 1 p and uL 16 (RPL 10), which is a late-binding protein during 60 S assembly (Gamalinda et al., 2014). It was shown that the loop of uL 16 residing in the ribosomal P-site is important for the activation of Efl 1 p to induce the release of Tif 6 p (Bussiere et al., 2012). Furthermore, uL 16 was shown {{to be involved in the}} recruitment of Sdo 1 p (Sulima et al., 2014 a), and a role of Sdo 1 p/SBDS as a nucleotide exchange factor to stabilize the binding of GTP to Efl 1 p was proposed (Gijsbers et al., 2013).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the stability of}} immiscible viscous fingering in Hele-Shaw cells with spatially varying permeability, {{across a range of}} capillary numbers. We utilise a coupled boundary element - radial basis function (BE –RBF) numerical method that adapts and moves with the growing interface, providing an efficient, high accuracy scheme to track the interfacial displacement of immiscible fluids. By comparing the interfacial evolution and growth rate in varying permeability cells to that in uniform cells, we can assess the relative stability of the perturbations {{as a consequence of the}} variable permeability. Numerical experiments in Hele-Shaw cells with gradually varying permeability highlight 3 aperture effects that control the interfacial stability: (1) Gradients in the capillary pressure (2) Local changes in fluid mobility (3) Variation in the viscous pressure gradient. In low capillary number regimes, we find that aperture effect 1 and 2 dominate, which (relatively) stabilise interfacial perturbations in converging geometries and destabilise perturbations in diverging geometries. In high capillary number regimes, aperture effect 3 dominates meaning the relative stability transitions; the interface is destabilised in <b>converging</b> <b>cells</b> and stabilised in diverging cells. We find an upper bound critical capillary number Cagt at which the relative stability transitions in our gradually varying cell as 1000 <Cagt< 1250, which is independent of both α and ϵ 0. This result is much lower than the value of Cagt= 9139 predicted by linear stability theory, due to significant non-linear perturbation growth. This transition links the results found in previous works performed at low and high capillary numbers, providing new insight into the viscous fingering instability in variable permeability cells. To conclude, we present simulations in Hele-Shaw cells with large geometric heterogeneities and anisotropy, in order to demonstrate the significant fluid re-distribution that can occur due to localised variations in cell permeability. Using periodic permeability distributions, we show the significant re-distribution of fluid that can occur due to large capillary pressure gradients in the capillary limit, and the channelling of flow that can occur in the viscous limit along anisotropic features...|$|R

Experiments with Src, p 85 alpha and Akt dominant-negative forms indicate that in oestradiol-treated cells these signalling effectors target the cyclin D 1 promoter. Oestradiol acutely increases PI 3 -kinase and Akt activities in MCF- 7 cells. In NIH 3 T 3 cells expressing ER alpha, a dominant-negative p 85 suppresses hormone stimulation of Akt. The Src inhibitor, PP 1, prevents hormone stimulation of Akt and PI 3 -kinase activities in MCF- 7 cells.
