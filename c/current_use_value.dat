40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} an environment valuation technique known as the Travel Cost Model on the recreational service flows of Kuala Selangor Nature Park (KSNP) and the adjacent fireflies recreation at Kampong Kuantan. The model attempts to estimate the economic value of the on-site <b>current</b> <b>use</b> <b>value</b> of recreational services for both the KSNP and the fireflies recreation. These resources are highlighted {{in the light of}} the current debate on a dam construction proposal up the Selangor River. The dam project might pose negative repercussions on the two resources, in particular the fireflies recreation which are located downstream the Selangor River. Ignoring the economic values of recreational services as well as other critical environmental functions might lead to bias estimates of the project’s Economic Internal Rate of Return favouring resource conversion (the dam project). The annual aggregate net benefits for the fireflies and KSNP recreational services were estimated at RM 2. 2 mill and RM 0. 9 mill, respectively. The high net benefits suggest that the recreational functions of wetlands or forest resources ought to be given serious consideration in decisions affecting the allocation and use of such resources. In the context of project analysis, environmental valuation provides policy-makers with an added perspective in decision making- to view a project in terms of social gains and losses, expressed in money metric...|$|E

40|$|Shirakami Mountain Range has {{the largest}} primeval forest in the world, and has some public functions; the {{biodiversity}} function, the water resource cultivation function, the health and recreation function and so on. This study tries to measure its environmental economic value by using the travel cost method (TCM) and the contingent valuation method (CVM). The TCM and the CVM are well-known as the typical technique of environmental economic valuation. The TCM can measure only the direct and <b>current</b> <b>use</b> <b>value</b> of environmental goods, but the CVM can measure the whole value including the non-use value of them. In the practice of environmental economic valuation, it is often adopted that the use value {{is measured by the}} TCM and that the non-use or the whole values are measured by CVM. However, there is no statistical significance in the difference between those values measured by the TCM and the CVM, because these methods are modeled independently and have no theoretical consistency. In this study, we have constructed a valuation model based on the CVM consistent with the TCM, in order to measure the use and the non-use values of environmental goods consistently. By applying this model to measurement of environmental economic value of Shirakami Mountain Range, practicality of the method is also examined. The result indicated that the willingness to pay (WTP) for the environmental preservation of Shirakami Mountain Range was estimated as 6, 679 JPY/person/year by using the CVM which had no consistency with the TCM, but it was estimated as 1, 028 JPY/person/year by using our model based on the CVM consistent with the TCM. Now, 6, 679 JPY/person/year means its whole value, but 1, 028 JPY/person/year means its non-use value. On the other hand, by using the TCM, the consumer surplus (CS) was estimated as 11, 154 JPY/person/year in the local area of Shirakami Mountain Range and 5, 579 JPY/person/year in Tokyo. Here, these values mean the use value of Shirakami Mountain Range. That is to say, the whole value was estimated as lower than the use value by using the CVM which had no consistency with the TCM. As a result, our model could measure the use and the non-use values of environmental goods consistently...|$|E

Laboratory tests indicated that replacement of one-half the wood in particleboard with ADBF produced panels that compared favorably to the requirements for commercial particleboard performance (specified by ANSI Standard A 208. 1 – 1999). The economic question hinges on the opportunity costs of alternative uses for ADBF. The <b>current</b> <b>use</b> is primarily animal bedding, and prices appear to be greater than those paid by particleboard plants for sawdust and planer shavings but less than for chips. ADBF is most similar in size to, thus most likely to be substitutable for, sawdust and shavings.
