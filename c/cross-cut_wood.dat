40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the wood and charcoal anatomy of charcoalproducing tree species and to investigate the alteration in wood macrostructure induced by charring. Eight hardwood species that are used for charcoal production in Central Sudan, were selected. The eight species were Acacia nilotica, Anogeissus leiocarpus, Acacia senegal, Acacia mellifera, Balanties aegyptiaca, Acacia seyal, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Prosopis chilensis. Each species was represented by five randomly chosen branches for each tree and these branches were felled. One meter length with mid diameter ranged between 5 and 10 cm were <b>cross-cut</b> as <b>wood</b> samples (billets), some of these samples were obtained from the stems and others from branches of each tree. A 10 cm long disc was taken {{from one end of the}} billets and used for the preparation of the samples needed to study wood micro-structure by using, a grid, computer screen (monitor), camera and light microscope. The other parts of the billets (about 90 cm long) was used to produce charcoal to study its macro-structure by using hand lens and constructing an identification key to distinguish the wood species from which charcoal was produced. The results revealed great wood variation among charcoal-producing species in the proportion of wood substance, distinctiveness of growth ring and the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of vessels, fiber, parenchyma and wood ray. In the charcoalified wood of all species, the fibers were not distinct. Some of the macroanatomical features, which were distinct in the wood samples, could not be seen in the charcoal samples of the same species (e. g. parenchyma arrangement and rays). The variation in the macro-anatomical characteristics of charcoal among species was sufficient to facilitate identification of the wood from which it was produced. A dichotomous key was prepared to distinguish among the studied species...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{communication}} from customer to supplier {{is crucial for}} {{the effectiveness of a}} value chain. In the forest products industry, a mutual understanding of quality requirements between customer and supplier in relation to material characteristics and production conditions is important if the material is to be utilized effectively. In the mechanical wood industry, hardwood has normally been quality graded manually. This has been a work-intensive operation and a problematic working environment. Automatic grading equipment based mainly on camera and laser technology is therefore gradually replacing the manual grading operation which relies on the human eye. The <b>cross-cutting</b> of sawn <b>wood</b> into shorter components with well-defined quality parameters is a process which needs to be automated. This makes it possible for the sawmill to redefine the quality grading process with e. g. more complex grading rules. To gain full benefits from the new technology, however, the grading process must be redefined in cooperation with the customers. There is also an expressed need for tools to communicate the quality of products produced by sawmills. In this study, three case studies were therefore performed where the communication of requirements between sawmills and customers was studied with regard to three different components delivered from two sawmills. In one sawmill, two products were studied; one intended for a furniture producer and one for a joinery producer. In the other sawmill, the studied product was intended for a producer of solid wood panels. The idea has been to study the need for product information expressed by both the customer and supplier through the automatic grading process and to utilise this equipment for data collection and visualisation. The requirements for a communication and data exchange tool have been derived. There is often an expressed need to measure how different raw materials affect the volume yield in a process and how different quality requirements affect the volume yield. Sharing this information between customer and supplier has been shown to yield a mutual understanding of how and why deviations occur. Visualisation possibilities are a prerequisite for a mutual understanding of quality conceptions. Godkänd; 2014; 20130910 (ysko); Konferensartikel i tidskrif...|$|R
