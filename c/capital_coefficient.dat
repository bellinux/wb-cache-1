40|$|Production {{functions}} are a central component {{in a variety}} of economic analyses. However, these production functions often first need to be estimated using data on individual production units. There is reason to believe that, more than any other input in the production process, there are severe errors in the recording of capital stock. Thus, when estimating production functions, we need to account for the ubiquity of measurement error in capital stock. This paper shows that commonly used estimation techniques in the productivity literature fail in the presence of plausible amounts of measurement error in capital. We propose an estimator that addresses this measurement error, while controlling for unobserved productivity shocks. Our main insight is that investment expenditures are informative about a producer’s capital stock, and we propose a hybrid IV-Control function approach that instruments capital with (lagged) investment, while relying on standard intermediate input demand equations to offset the simultaneity bias. We rely on a series of Monte Carlo simulations and find that standard approaches yield downward-biased <b>capital</b> <b>coefficients,</b> while our estimator does not. We apply our estimator to two standard datasets, the census of manufacturing firms in India and Slovenia, and find <b>capital</b> <b>coefficients</b> that are, on average, twice as large...|$|R

40|$|This paper takes a {{different}} approach to wage equation estimation–that of the firm. In the human-capital/competitive-market model, the coefficients in the wage equation estimate the skill production function. The paper demonstrates (and proves) that this skill production function is also the labour term in a firm production function, providing a new method for estimating, for example, the schooling coefficient in a Mincer equation. In addition, inclusion of this skill production function in the labour term of a firm production function opens up a new methodology for acquiring a measure of unobserved worker ability, which can then be used as a direct control for ability in a wage regression. While the wage equation human <b>capital</b> <b>coefficients</b> should be identical to the production function human <b>capital</b> <b>coefficients,</b> the methodology allows for testing to determine whether various characteristics such as schooling are remunerated according to their productivity. Since a productivity-based definition of worker ability is included in the wage estimation, this not only avoids the traditional ability bias, but also other forms of endogeneity that occur after the schooling decision. The methodology is tested in the context of Ghana, a setting where the accurate measurement of returns to education is particularly important. Using this method, the internal rate of return to education is estimated at roughly 7 %, after correcting for an average ability bias of approximately 3 %...|$|R

The accounting system plays a crucial role in finding appropriate strategies for achieving suitable methods of evaluating intellectual capitals. One of the most significant shortcomings of traditional accounting systems is that it doesn't reflect the intellectual capital value in financial reports of business units. Collecting the data from 84 firms, this study examines the relationship between intellectual capital and financing costs, and the value of manufacturing companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange for an eight-year period. In order to measure intellectual capital, the value-added of intellectual <b>capital</b> <b>coefficient,</b> value-added of intellectual capital and value added of capital applied were used the calculation of which were performed through Palic's method {{which is one of the}} most practical methods of calculating intellectual capital.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} reasons why GMM estimators of {{production}} function parameters are generally found to produce unsatisfactory results. I attribute this finding to the inaccurate construction of the variables used in production function analysis. In particular, I suggest that the problem lies {{in the use of}} common price deflators as well as in a capital variable that does not reflect the true flow of capital services because of short-run equilibrium effects. I show that the practice of using industry-wide deflators leads to lower scale estimates, mainly due to a relevant downward bias in the labour coefficient. At the same time, it introduces a large upward bias in estimating the elasticity of output with respect to technological innovation. Moreover, a significant improvement in the estimates of <b>capital</b> <b>coefficients</b> is obtained if the information on the degree of capacity utilization is adequately exploite...|$|R
