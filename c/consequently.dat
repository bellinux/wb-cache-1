5|$|Gagetown, New Brunswick {{was named}} in his honour; the Canadian Forces base CFB Gagetown <b>consequently</b> carries his name.|$|E
5|$|Hamuis {{suffered}} {{a broken leg}} during his junior draft-eligible season, limiting his exposure to WHL scouts. <b>Consequently,</b> he went unselected in the WHL Bantam Draft.|$|E
5|$|However, heavy {{environmental}} protests ensued {{over the}} chosen route through the marsh. <b>Consequently,</b> then Transportation Minister Ed Fulton officially cancelled the extension on April21, 1986.|$|E
5|$|Malm√∂'s kit is {{manufactured}} by Puma, who also sponsor the club. <b>Consequently,</b> various Puma products {{are sold in}} the club's souvenir shop at Swedbank Stadion.|$|E
5|$|On April16, 1970, the Highway85 {{designation}} {{was moved}} from King Street {{to the new}} Conestoga Parkway; King Street was <b>consequently</b> transferred to local jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|A ball {{in touch}} is dead, <b>consequently</b> {{the side that}} touches it down must {{bring it to the}} edge of the touch and throw it {{straight}} out from touch.|$|E
5|$|Although ferries (and later bridges) {{had crossed}} the river to the east at Richmond since 1459 and to the west at Eel Pie Island since at least 1652 the lands {{to the south of}} the river at this point had {{historically}} been privately held by the Tollemache family (owners of Ham House) and off limits to the public. <b>Consequently,</b> despite the distance from the nearest crossings there was little demand for cross-river services at this location. Additionally, the Tollemache family had licensing rights for the Twickenham Ferry at Eel Pie Island (sometimes known as Dysart's ferry after the family), and <b>consequently</b> had little interest in promoting a competing service. The Twickenham Ferry is a setting for some action in Little Dorritt by Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|Amrullah Saleh <b>consequently</b> {{founded the}} Basej-e Milli (National Movement), {{also known as}} Afghanistan Green Trend, a {{political}} movement which has successfully established itself in Afghanistan. In May 2011, more than 20,000 of his followers took part in an anti-Taliban demonstration in the capital Kabul.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{divergent}} {{evolution of}} function (and even the triad's nucleophile), catalytic triads show {{some of the}} best examples of convergent evolution. Chemical constraints on catalysis have led to the same catalytic solution independently evolving in at least 23 separate superfamilies. Their mechanism of action is <b>consequently</b> one of the best studied in biochemistry.|$|E
5|$|At 10:40, Gonen ordered Adan {{to cross}} {{to the west}} bank and Sharon to move towards Suez City. Short of forces, Adan {{requested}} that Sharon send a battalion to protect his southern flank. Gonen consented, but Sharon would not comply, and <b>consequently</b> several critical positions would be lost to the Egyptians later on.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the program, Kurt Angle {{announced}} he received a legitimate neck injury wrestling overseas a few days prior to the show. He <b>consequently</b> removed himself from the main event at the order of his doctor.|$|E
5|$|Because the Home Army was {{loyal to}} the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Soviet Union saw it as an {{obstacle}} to a Soviet takeover of Poland. <b>Consequently,</b> {{over the course of the}} war, conflict grew between the Home Army and Soviet forces.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the pulp}} and {{periodontal}} ligament have nociceptors (pain receptors), but the pulp lacks proprioceptors (motion or position receptors) and mechanoreceptors (mechanical pressure receptors). <b>Consequently,</b> pain originating from the dentin-pulp complex {{tends to be}} poorly localized, whereas pain from the periodontal ligament will typically be well localized, although not always.|$|E
5|$|By {{the thirteenth}} and fourteenth centuries AD, Virgil had gained a {{reputation}} as a virtuous pagan, a term referring to pagans who were never evangelized and <b>consequently</b> during their lifetime had no opportunity to recognize Christ, but nevertheless led virtuous lives, so that it seemed objectionable to consider them damned. Eventually, some Christians sought to reconcile Virgil's works with the supposed Christianity present in them. <b>Consequently,</b> during the Late Antiquity and beyond, many assumed that the puer referenced in the Fourth Eclogue was actually Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|Cambodia has no proven {{fossil fuel}} reserves, and is almost {{completely}} dependent on imported diesel fuel for electricity production. <b>Consequently,</b> Cambodians face an insecure supply and pay {{some of the}} highest energy prices in the world. The impacts of this are widespread and may hinder economic development.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have very}} large aspect ratio, i.e., their length {{is much larger}} than their diameter. <b>Consequently,</b> as expected from the classical electromagnetic theory, elastic light scattering (or Rayleigh scattering) by straight CNTs has anisotropic angular dependence, and from its spectrum, the band gaps of individual nanotubes can be deduced.|$|E
5|$|Commercial and {{cultural}} contacts extended India's influence in Western and Southeast Asia. Ganesha {{is one of}} a number of Hindu deities who <b>consequently</b> reached foreign lands.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the {{forebrain}} to the midbrain is the diencephalon (in the diagram, {{this structure}} {{is below the}} optic lobes and <b>consequently</b> not visible). The diencephalon performs functions associated with hormones and homeostasis. The pineal body lies just above the diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains circadian rhythms, and controls color changes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Consequently,</b> Murray cod inhabit {{a remarkably}} {{wide variety of}} habitats, from cool, clear, fast-flowing streams with riffle-and-pool {{structure}} and rocky substrates in upland areas to large, slow flowing, meandering rivers in the extensive alluvial lowland reaches of the Murray-Darling basin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Consequently,</b> San Diego has {{experienced}} negative net migration since 2004. A {{significant number of}} people moved to adjacent Riverside County, commuting daily to jobs in San Diego, while others are leaving the region altogether and moving to more affordable regions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Consequently,</b> in October 2017, Grove, Zorn, and Dougherty were {{replaced}} as the Trio by new licensees Reynolds and Marvin and their friend and musical director Tim Gorelangton.|$|E
5|$|<b>Consequently,</b> some expect {{oganesson}} to {{have similar}} {{physical and chemical}} properties to other members of its group, most closely resembling the noble gas above it in the periodic table, radon.|$|E
5|$|<b>Consequently,</b> {{specific}} types of horse developed, {{many of which have}} no modern equivalent. While an understanding of modern horse breeds and equestrianism is vital for any analysis of the medieval horse, researchers also need to consider documentary (both written and pictorial) and archaeological evidence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Consequently,</b> the {{assumptions}} and theories developed by historians are not definitive, and debate still rages on many issues, {{such as the}} breeding or size of the horse, {{and a number of}} sources must be consulted {{in order to understand the}} breadth of the subject.|$|E
5|$|<b>Consequently,</b> the {{remaining}} section of Highway86, which exclusively followed the Conestoga Parkway, was renumbered as Highway85 {{during the spring}} of 2003 to align the numbers and aid navigation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Consequently,</b> under Seydlitz's direction, by {{the start}} of the Seven Years' War, the cavalry had become Frederick's pride and joy: it had unrivaled {{training}} and an esprit de corps bolstered by Frederick's confidence in its members, and by their confidence in Seydlitz. The King had issued orders that no Prussian cavalryman would allow himself to be attacked without a commensurate response, under penalty of being cashiered; <b>consequently,</b> Prussian cavalrymen were active, impetuous and aggressive. For the King, Seydlitz's cavalry became the dynamic factor in the army of the state, and would be the tool by which Frederick could challenge empires. In 1756, Seydlitz's cavalry became Frederick's weapon of choice.|$|E
5|$|<b>Consequently,</b> {{under the}} socialist Second Republic, French {{instructors}} and other nationals were expelled, Malagasy was declared {{the language of}} instruction and a large cadre of young Malagasy were rapidly trained to teach at remote rural schools under the mandatory two-year national service policy.|$|E
5|$|Each team progressed {{through five}} rounds {{to reach the}} final. Both teams {{were members of the}} Football League First Division, Bolton Wanderers occupying a {{position}} in upper-mid-table and Manchester City next to bottom. <b>Consequently,</b> Bolton entered the match as favourites and, as expected, went on to win, their single goal being scored by David Jack.|$|E
5|$|For {{the general}} {{case of a}} line {{terminated}} in some arbitrary impedance it is usual to describe the signal as a wave traveling down the line and analyse it in the frequency domain. The impedance is <b>consequently</b> represented as a frequency dependant complex function.|$|E
5|$|However, as the Earth {{gravity assist}} approached, astronomers {{were unable to}} locate Comet Boethin, which may have broken up into pieces too faint to be observed. <b>Consequently,</b> its orbit could not be {{calculated}} with sufficient precision to permit a flyby.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, IG Farben was the world's fourth-largest {{company and}} its largest {{chemical}} company. <b>Consequently,</b> the space requirements for the building were {{for one of the}} largest office buildings ever constructed. It was designed in the New Objectivity style.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{when the}} show {{was added to the}} Netflix platform, it was the highest watched program and <b>consequently,</b> Netflix were in contact with the BBC for discussions on {{continuing}} the program. Nothing since has been heard of this rumour.|$|E
5|$|In November 1994, Taiwan {{passed a}} law {{regarding}} the use of private finance in infrastructure projects, which also applied to the up-to-then state-run THSR project. <b>Consequently,</b> in 1995, POHSR was transformed into the Bureau of High Speed Rail (BOHSR), which started to tender THSR as a build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme in October 1996.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, 179 of 240 {{members of}} {{parliament}} {{voted in favor of}} pausing the subsidy reform, because of high inflation (exacerbated by the sanctions against Iran). <b>Consequently,</b> the growth in consumption of subsidized products rebounded in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the areas surrounding the bridge becoming prosperous suburbs, tolls were set at relatively high rates on a sliding scale, ranging from a penny for pedestrians to 2s6d for vehicles drawn by six horses. Exemptions were granted for mail coaches, soldiers on duty and parliamentary candidates during election campaigns. However, {{the area around the}} bridge failed to develop as expected. In 1815 John Doulton built the Doulton & Watts (later Royal Doulton) stoneware factory at Vauxhall, and <b>consequently</b> instead of the wealthy residents anticipated by the company, the area began to fill with narrow streets of working class tenements to house the factory's workers. Meanwhile, the large Millbank Penitentiary was built near the northern end of the bridge, discouraging housing development. <b>Consequently,</b> toll revenues were initially lower than expected, and the dividends paid to investors were low.|$|E
5|$|In the Northern Isles, James's cousin Patrick Stewart, Earl of Orkney, {{resisted}} the Statutes of Iona and was <b>consequently</b> imprisoned. His natural son Robert led an unsuccessful rebellion against James, and the Earl {{and his son}} were hanged. Their estates were forfeited, and the Orkney and Shetland islands were annexed to the Crown.|$|E
