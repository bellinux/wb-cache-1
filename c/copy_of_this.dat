5|$|Ealdred had {{returned}} to England by 1055, and brought with him {{a copy of the}} Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a set of liturgies, with him. An extant <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> work, currently manuscript Cotton Vitellus E xii, has been identified as a copy owned by Ealdred. It appears likely that the Rule of Chrodegang, a continental set of ordinances for the communal life of secular canons, was introduced into England by Ealdred sometime before 1059. Probably he brought it back from Germany, possibly in concert with Harold.|$|E
5|$|In November 2005 Allingham {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the International Holographic Portrait Archive to have his holographic portrait taken.

A <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> portrait was donated to the museum and HRH The Duchess of Gloucester unveiled the portrait to mark {{the opening of the}} exhibition.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{writer and}} director, Shigesato Itoi, pitched the game concept to Shigeru Miyamoto while visiting Nintendo's {{headquarters}} for other business. Though Miyamoto denied the proposal at first, he eventually gave Itoi a development team. The game {{was released in}} Japan on July 27, 1989. A North American version was localized into English, but was abandoned as commercially nonviable. A <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> prototype was later found and circulated on the Internet under the unofficial, fan-created title EarthBound Zero to differentiate it from its officially-released sequel, EarthBound. The game was eventually released worldwide under the name EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console on June 14, 2015.|$|E

5|$|Swaminarayan {{wrote the}} Shikshapatri on 11 February 1826. While the {{original}} Sanskrit manuscript is not available, it {{was translated into}} Gujarati by Nityanand Swami {{under the direction of}} Swaminarayan and is revered in the sect. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency summarised it as a book of social laws that his followers should follow. A commentary on the practice and understanding of dharma, it is a small booklet containing 212 Sanskrit verses, outlining the basic tenets that Swaminarayan believed his followers should uphold in order to live a well-disciplined and moral life. The oldest <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> text is preserved at the Bodleian Library of Oxford University and {{it is one of the}} very few presented by Sahajanand Swami himself. Acharya Tejendraprasad of Ahmedabad has indicated in a letter that he is not aware of any copy from the hand of Sahajanand older than this text.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type is the live bootleg, or {{audience}} recording, which is created with sound recording equipment smuggled into a live concert. Many artists and live venues prohibit this form of recording, but from the 1970s onwards the increased availability of portable technology made such bootlegging easier, and the general quality of these recordings has improved over time as consumer equipment becomes sophisticated. A number of bootlegs originated with FM radio broadcasts of live or previously recorded live performances. Other bootlegs may be soundboard recordings taken directly from a multi-track mixing console used to feed the public address system at a live performance. Artists may record their own shows for private review, but engineers may surreptitiously take a <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> which ends up being shared. As a soundboard recording is intended to supplement the natural acoustics of a gig, a bootleg may have an inappropriate mix of instruments, unless the gig is so large that everything needs to be amplified {{and sent to the}} desk.|$|E
