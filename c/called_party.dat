25|$|Supervision (line signaling) was {{supplied}} by a District circuit, {{similar to the}} plug and light cord circuit that plugged into a line jack on a switchboard. It supervised the calling and <b>called</b> <b>party</b> and, when both had gone on-hook, released the ground on the sleeve lead, thus releasing all selectors, which returned down to their start position to make ready for further traffic. Some District frames were equipped with the more complex supervisory and timing circuits required to generate coin collect and return signals for handling calls from payphones.|$|E

The Panel system was the Bell System {{solution to the}} big city problem, where an exchange had to serve large numbers of subscribers on both manual as well as automatically switched central offices without impacting negatively established user convenience and reliability. As originally introduced in these exchanges, subscribers telephones had no dials and customers continued to make calls by asking an operator to ring their <b>called</b> <b>party,</b> {{at which point the}} operator keyed {{the telephone}} number into the panel equipment, instead of making cord connections manually.|$|E

2500|$|A {{telephone}} number {{serves as an}} address for switching telephone calls using a system of destination code routing. [...] Telephone numbers are entered or dialed by a calling party on the originating telephone set, which transmits the sequence of digits {{in the process of}} signaling to a telephone exchange. The exchange completes the call either to another locally connected subscriber or via the PSTN to the <b>called</b> <b>party.</b> Telephone numbers are assigned within the framework of a national or regional {{telephone number}}ing plan to subscribers by telephone service operators, which may be commercial entities, state-controlled administrations, or other telecommunication industry associations.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Folds (as a bassist) and {{longtime}} friend Millard Powers formed the band Majosha. The group released several locally produced records. They played their first gig at Duke University's Battle of the Bands in 1988, and won. They played at bars and fraternity parties, and self-produced an EP <b>called</b> <b>Party</b> Night: Five Songs About Jesus (1988), which they sold locally. The EP has four songs, {{none of which}} are about Jesus. They recorded Shut Up and Listen to Majosha in 1989. It contains, among other tracks, the four songs from Party Night (remixed and/or re-recorded) and [...] "Emaline" [...] and [...] "Video", which Folds would later record with Ben Folds Five.

40|$|In {{competitive}} telecommunications markets each carrier {{relies on}} competing networks to terminate internetwork calls. Regulators typically require the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> network {{to pay a}} termination fee to the <b>called</b> <b>party's</b> network equal to the terminating network's "incremental cost" of completing the call, effectively imposing all of the costs on the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> network. These payments can affect retail prices and therefore consumption. I show that when both parties benefit from a call, they should bear its costs {{in proportion to the}} benefit they receive. Therefore, imposing all of the costs of an internetwork call on the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> network can be inefficient if these costs are reflected in the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> usage rates. A system in which two networks exchange traffic at specified points on a bill-and-keep basis imposes some of the cost on each network, which will then be imposed on the parties. This can generate more efficient network utilization, even with unbalanced traffic between networks. Thus, regulators may improve the efficiency of telecommunications markets by establishing bill-and-keep intercarrier compensation rules.
