Single letters, subtending a visual angle of 0. 35 degrees, were foveally presented for 10 ms and were immediately followed by a mask. We investigated 30 different delays (d), defined as the time between the onset of the visual stimulus and the onset of the magnetic stimulus, from d = - 100 ms to d = + 190 ms, and 4 different midsagittal coil positions (x), defined as the distance between the lower edge of the coil and the upper edge of the inion, from x = 1 cm to x = 7 cm. Three out of four subjects showed three distinct delay intervals (dips) at which application of TMS resulted in an impairment of the task. The first dip was <b>centred</b> around <b>d</b> = - 50 ms and occurred independently of the coil position; the second dip was <b>centred</b> around <b>d</b> = 0 ms and was elicitable only with the two lowest coil positions; the third dip was <b>centred</b> around <b>d</b> = 100 ms and was also elicitable only with the lower coil positions.

Both bradaris contain children born to consanguineous (first cousin) and nonconsanguineous marriages.

The specific allele frequencies, and levels of homozygosity of each bradari, were determined using twenty fluorescence-labelled microsatellite markers for chromosomes 13 and 15. Amplification of the DNA was performed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were separated electrophoretically on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer, with GeneScan software employed to identify the alleles of each individual.

40|$|Wideband {{wavelength}} conversion utilizing four-wave mixing (FWM) in {{optical fibres}} has received significant {{attention in the}} area of fibre communications and networking, due to the natural low-loss compatibility with the conventional optical transmission systems [ref]. Within a 30 cm long <b>centre</b> <b>ð</b> phase-shifted distributed-feedback (DFB) grating, formed in a commercially available germano-silica optical fibre (PS 980, from Fibercore Ltd.), we recently experimentally demonstrated up to ~ 167 nm wavelength conversion with a conversion efficiency up to - 25 dB [1, 2]. The concept of the FWM in that work was the following; firstly, a ~ 2 W single-mode, single polarization Yb-doped fibre laser at 1064 nm was used to pump a Raman DFB (R-DFB) grating to generate a narrowband signal at ~ 1117 nm (the Bragg wavelength of the DFB) [3]. This lasing signal with a power of ~ 80 mW subsequently acted as the pump for the FWM process allowing for the wavelength conversion of a low-power probe signal (~ 10 mW) extending from 1040. 8 nm to 1207. 8 nm. Evidently, the phase-matching condition must be fulfilled to facilitate the FWM process. Although the wavelength region for the demonstrated FWM process lies entirely within the normal dispersion regime of the fibre, we believe that both the dispersion from the grating itself and the high intensity of the circulating lasing signal within the grating contributed strongly to modify the overall dispersion within the structure, thus enabling the phase-matching for such an efficient and wide-range FWM process...|$|R

Traditionally, rows of rubber trees have been combined with single cycles of food crops, and yields have often been low. Now experiments have come up with new combinations of crops which use few inputs and require no special material. The approach compensates for the non-productive period of the rubber trees youth, over the first five to seven years. The combinations of crops which work best in the forest soils are rice and groundnuts for two or three crop cycles, followed by plantain for one cycle, or cassava as an annual crop, or vegetables with rice, groundnuts and plantain for one or two cycles. There are many benefits to these mixtures: tillage is cut down, the rubber trees grow better, and farmers incomes rise and diversify.

This implies that Aut(F 3) does not have Kazhdan’s prop-erty (T) (see [3] and [6] for another proofs). We proved also that every subgroup of finite index in Aut(Fn), n> 3, which contains the subgroup of IA-automorphisms, has a finite abelianization. 1. Definitions, problems and motivations The Kazhdan property (T) was introduced by D. Kazhdan in 1967 in his investigations on Lie groups. Let H be a Hilbert space and U(H) be the group of unitary transforma-tions of H. Definition 1. 1. A discrete group G has Kazhdan’s property (T) if there exists an ε> 0 and a finite subset S ⊂ G such that for all nontrivial irreducible representations ρ: G → U(H) and for all vectors v ∈ H with ||v| | = 1 we have ||ρ(s) v − v| |> ε for some s ∈ S. It is known, {{that in this case}} S generates G. Definition 1. 2. A group G has Serre’s property (FA) if acting simplicially and without inversions of edges on any simplicial tree, G has a global fixed point. Theorem 1. 3. (J. -P. Serre; 1974). A finitely generated group G has the property (FA) if and only if the following two statements hold: (1) G is not a nontrivial amalgamated product, that is G A ∗B C with B 6 = A and B 6 = C, (2) G does not have a quotient which is isomorphic to Z, This paper was prepared while the first-named author was a visitor at <b>Centre</b> <b>d...</b>|$|R

Scanning proton {{microprobe}} {{analysis was}} used to determine the distribution of strontium (Sr) in otoliths from arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) of known non-anadromous, known anadromous, and unknown life histories. Strontium concentration patterns in otoliths of known non-anadromous charr were low and relatively flat (with little variation) from the core area to the outermost edge of the otolith, while patterns for known anadromous charr were characterized by a similar low, flat region for the first several years of life, followed by marked oscillatory increases and decreases in Sr content {{for the duration of the}} fish’s life. Small and large forms of Lake Hazen charr of unknown life histories exhibited Sr profiles that were similar to those of the known non-anadromous charr, which strongly suggests that Lake Hazen charr are non-anadromous. These results indicate that Lake Hazen is a “closed ” system with energy cycling primarily within the system; this conclusion suggests that a conservative approach would be appropriate for the management of the Lake Hazen charr population.

40|$|R factor = 0. 025; wR factor = 0. 049; data-to-parameter ratio = 43. 5. The {{structure}} of hexadecapraseodymium henicosamolybdenum hexapentacontaoxide, Pr 16 Mo 21 O 56, is isotypic with other rare earth representatives of formula type RE 16 Mo 21 O 56 (RE = La, Ce, Nd). It {{is characterized by}} Mo 10 O 18 i O 8 a units (where i = inner and a = apical O atoms) containing bioctahedral Mo 10 clusters and octahedral MoO 6 units that share some of their O atoms to form the Mo–O framework. The two independent Mo 10 cluster units are centred at Wyckoff positions 2 b and 2 c and have point-group symmetry 1. The Mo atom of the MoO 6 unit is likewise situated at an inversion <b>centre</b> (2 <b>d).</b> The eight crystallographically different Pr 3 + cations occupy irregular voids in the framework with coordination numbers to the O atoms varying between 8 and 11.

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of background species and analyte in a He FAPES source have been determined using a charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging system. Imaging of the He 667. 82 nm support gas line reveals the presence of two distinct plasmas: an intense luminous zone located around the centre electrode and a diffuse plasma near the tube walls. In a graphite tube at room temperature, the plasma system exhibits a significant dependence on the d. c. bias of the centre electrode for a constant forward r. f. power of 50 W. Polyatomic background species exhibit similar overall distributions and response {{to changes in the}} <b>centre</b> electrode <b>d.</b> c. bias. The ingress of atmospheric nitrogen into the plasma can be indirectly detected at elevated tube wall temperatures. Images obtained for Ag atomized into 30 W and 50 W plasmas point out the role of the centre electrode as a primary condensation and secondary re-volatilization site. Condensation and re-evaporation is alleviated when Ag is atomized into a 70 W plasma as the result of plasma-induced heating of the centre electrode. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
