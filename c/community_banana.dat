40|$|The European Union (EU) is {{currently}} the main market outlet for imported bananas, with an estimated annual turnover of ECU 2 billion ($ 1. 8 billion) in 1996 (excluding trade between EU members). By 1999, European demand for bananas (excluding EU production) is projected to reach about 3. 3 million tonnes annually. Who are the leading suppliers of bananas to the European Union? In addition to EU producers, suppliers include ACP signatories to the Lomé Convention and some Central and Latin American banana-producing countries. The Common Market Organisation for Bananas, set up in 1993 and extended by the Framework Agreement endorsed in Marrakech (1994), led to allocation of import quotas based on three different banana origins, with a provision for compensation {{to make up for}} any loss of income subsequent to market consolidation. A tariff quota of 2. 2 million tonnes was established for dollar bananas from third country origins, at a tariff of ECU 75 a tonne. In September 1996, USA, supported by Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras and Mexico, contested the terms of the Marrakech trading agreement and lodged a complaint for violation of trade laws. What is actually at issue? Is the percentages of the third-country tariff quota allocated to four Latin American signatories to the Framework Agreement. It is the quotas designated for non-traditional ACP bananas (80, 000 t) that are being contested. The percentages of the tariff quota allocated to Venezuela and Nicaragua are being disputed, i. e. WTO contends that these two countries do not have a sufficient vested interest in the banana industry. Rejection of the terms of the Marrakech agreements, along with the modified status and increased demands of American multinational corporations (Chiquita, Dole, Del Monte), could create a new order with respect to the import subsector.

40|$|Banana {{is a key}} crop in the {{livelihoods}} of {{many people}} in the Great Lakes region of East and Central Africa. For more than a decade now, the crop has been threatened by Banana Xanthomonas Wilt (BXW) which has spread throughout the region but at different rates. The disease attacks all banana cultivars and can cause up to 100 % yield losses at farm level if effective control measures are not put in place. However, limited information on impact of BXW at regional level is available to guide interventions. Thus, this study assessed the impact of BXW on farmers’ livelihoods in Kagera basin of Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda. A total of 436 households (Tanzania 120, Burundi 208 and Rwanda 108) mostly from major banana-producing and BXW-affected districts were sampled and interviewed in a household survey. Thirty-three to seventy-five of the total banana mats per farm in the three countries were infected with BXW. Banana production losses caused by BXW were valued at US$ 10. 2 million and US$ 2. 95 million in Tanzania and Rwanda, respectively, banana sales by farmers dropped by 35 % while bunch prices unpredictably doubled. Since banana is a key component of these farming <b>communities,</b> the <b>banana</b> production losses resulted in significant reduction in household food security and incomes. To cope with these challenges, most households are diversifying into other food crops such as maize, cassava and sweet potatoes. This poses a number of socio-economic and biological implications that require further investigation. Peer Revie...|$|R

Pieces of fruit exposed to adult female flies previously fed fly-conditioned bananas developed higher yeast densities than pieces of the same fruits that were not exposed to flies, supporting previous suggestions that adult Drosophila vector yeasts to new substrates. However, larvae alone had dramatic effects on yeast density and species composition. When yeast densities were compared in pieces of the same fruits assigned to different treatments, fruits that developed low yeast densities {{in the absence of}} flies developed significantly higher yeast densities when exposed to larvae. Across all of the fruits, larvae regulated yeast densities within narrow limits, as compared to a much wider range of yeast densities that developed in pieces of the same fruits not exposed to flies. Larvae also affected yeast species composition, dramatically reducing species diversity across fruits, reducing variation in yeast communities from one fruit to the next (beta diversity), and encouraging the consistent development of a yeast community composed of three species of yeast (Candida californica, C. zemplinina, and Pichia kluvyeri), all of which were palatable to larvae. Larvae excreted viable cells of these three yeast species in their fecal pools, and discouraged the growth of filamentous fungi, processes which may have contributed to their effects on the yeast <b>communities</b> in <b>banana</b> fruits.

The many names for banana cultivars, including synonyms and homonyms, in combination with further difficulties in cultivar description and classification means that we cannot accurately quantify such important details as how many cultivars there are and where they are distributed. We have created the Online Checklist of Banana Cultivars on the ProMusa website to bring the large amount of existing information on banana cultivar names and related relevant information into one easily accessible and searchable resource ([URL] As of August 8, 2014 the Online Checklist of Banana Cultivars contains 6965 entries, with 4911 unique local names, corresponding to 1940 cultivars, in 39 subgroups, in 15 groups, in 93 locations, with the information being sourced from 38 references.

The case of a community enterprise producing dried banana products in the north of Thailand is used to demonstrate the significance of the Triple Helix model for business and technology development in SMEs. Government initiatives designed to promote innovation leading to price and quality competitiveness of the products of SMEs and community enterprises are explored and their effectiveness is discussed. In developing countries, where there are weak links and limited interactions between the institutional sectors of government, academia and industry, intermediaries {{play a crucial role in}} building networks to facilitate the transfer and exchange of knowledge. Effective network links would enable SMEs to have access to various sources of financial, knowledge, technology and market support.

40|$|The need {{to improve}} the {{position}} of the banana and plantain industry in ACP economies was the focus of an international conference held in November 1998 in Douala, Cameroon. The host country is a fine example of how central these crops are to the economies of some countries, where large areas of the national territory are devoted to plantain cultivation and where almost 90 % of the output is consumed locally. The conference underscored how the range of banana by-products (see Spore 74) continues to grow as researchers find new uses, ranging from shampoo to paper. It also stressed that the key role of banana and plantain in food security in many countries merited wider recognition. More than 150 researchers from the ACP countries, Latin America, and Asia attended the conference, making it a vibrant forum of ideas and experiences on improving cultivation, processing, and marketing. Indeed, the benefits of these exchanges-between countries from Thailand to Trinidad-were reflected in the main recommendations. More information is needed about the many uses of the plant, the strong and weak points of the banana sector, and its economic value. With better information, research could be oriented more towards meeting the needs of the consumer, with particular focus on transport, marketing, and development of by-products. The Doula conference helped the <b>banana</b> <b>community</b> focus its efforts more effectively and encouraged it to obtain, to share, and to use improved data on this important crop. The conference was organised jointly by the International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain (INIBAP), the Cameroon regional research centre CRBP, the French centre for development-oriented agricultural research CIRAD, FAO, French Development Cooperation, the European Union, and CTA.

Moreover, the effect of the change of endophytic bacterial <b>communities</b> in <b>banana</b> roots to Fusarium wilt pathogen infection were analysed by DGGE on the basis of 16 S rDNA sequence. The result demonstrated that 11 species endophytic bacteria were identified as Bacillus altitudinis, Bacillus barbaricus, Bacillus mycoides, Bacillus stratosphericus, Burkholderia anthina, Pseudomonas mendocina, Serratia nematodiphila, Rhizobium miluonense, Rhizobium multihospitium, Rhizobium radiobacter, and Rhodococcus triatomae, respectively. Among these isolated, only the bei- 1 - 7 belong to Burkholderia anthina had ever to report in the reference that it was existing in banana roots; others were found in first. The bei- 1 - 7 had the most antifungal activity against FOC race 4 with 98 %, and the influence of this inhibitor that secreted from this bacterium also had a level of prevention efficacy when sterilized. In Burkholderia genus, if bacteria species belong to the flora of B. anthina、B. arboris、B. cenocepacia、B. latens、B. metallica、B. seminalis, and B. vietnamiensis that their 16 S rDNA had more closely comparability, and its ability of against FOC race 4 had more remarkably.
