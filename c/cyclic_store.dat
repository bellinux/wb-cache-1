50|$|For TXE4, TXE4E {{replaced}} the ten Miniature Threaded Wire Stores (MTWS) in the MCU {{with just two}} units, each containing six re-programmable chips which could be removed and updated with changes via a separate computer. This doubled the program store with an additional bank-switched 5,000 program steps and provided the communication port to interface to the enhancement processors. The <b>Cyclic</b> <b>Stores</b> threading fields (12mS x 156mS & 3 x 36mS) were commoned and all new subscribers, ceases or change of Class Of Service, which were threaded previously, were now done via a terminal. This brought it {{more in line with}} TXE4A.|$|R
50|$|An object graph is a {{directed}} graph, {{which might}} be <b>cyclic.</b> When <b>stored</b> in RAM, objects occupy different segments of the memory with their attributes and function table, while relationships are represented by pointers or {{a different type of}} global handler in higher-level languages.|$|R
50|$|A {{problem was}} {{discovered}} very {{late in the}} development of the TXE4 in that an equipment number could be threaded with the wrong directory number by mistake on the <b>cyclic</b> <b>stores.</b> Even worse it could be the directory number of another equipment number leading to multiple directory numbers. This would cause Number Unobtainable (NU) tone when the incorrectly threaded number was dialled and the double threading number received incorrect calls. The exchange had no way of detecting this but the programming of one of the MCUs allowed a separate programme to run to detect this problem and print out the locations of the duplicates. This had to be done on a regular basis. Eventually, after many more diagnostic routines had been added, this became known as Tester 299A, even though it was only software.|$|R
50|$|Line {{scanning}} circuits sequentially {{examined the}} state of each line, junctions and so on {{by means of a}} pulse many times a second and immediately after each pulse a data store (the <b>Cyclic</b> <b>Store)</b> offered the MCU permanent information relating to the line. When a calling condition was detected, the scanning pulse was passed to the MCU indicating to it that a new call had to be set up and busying it temporarily to further calls. As the first steps in dealing with the new call the MCU recorded the directory number and class of service (shared service, PABX line, incoming junction register, TOS and so on) information offered by the <b>Cyclic</b> <b>Store</b> and allocates one of its associated group of up to 30 registers. The registers were connected to peripheral terminals of the switching network, {{in the same way as}} subscribers' lines, junction circuits and other units and the MCU proceeded to issue instructions to the network to connect the subscriber and register terminals.|$|E
50|$|Subscriber {{information}} was programmed into the exchange in racks called cyclic stores which used PTFE wire threaded through magnetic cores known as 'Dimond ring' (see TXE2 section for more information). The information stored was the Class of Service (COS) i.e. PBX, CCB (payphone) or single line, {{followed by the}} directory number. The subscribers derived an equipment number from the position on the <b>cyclic</b> <b>store</b> rack. This was a six-digit number and {{referred to as the}} MUCKBL, which describes to the exchange where this is. In some parts of the exchange equipment was in the format of BUMCLK and this was used by engineers as a pseudo swear word. When a subscriber lifted their handset it sent a pulse down this wire, which was picked up by a 156 ms scanner, which initiated a path to be set up through the reed relays so the subscriber could be connected to a Register. This Register then returned dialling tone to the subscriber and dialling could commence.|$|E
5000|$|The Registers were [...] "owned" [...] by the MCUs {{and each}} MCU had {{a maximum of}} 36 Registers. The MCU was {{responsible}} for looking after all of its Registers and deciding from the dialled information where the call {{was going to be}} routed. The local exchange numbering system would be available to the MCU via threadings in the <b>cyclic</b> <b>store</b> so the MCU would be able to read this information and in this way all exchanges could be configured as required. If a call was identified by the MCU as being own exchange, usually by the first digit, then the MCU would tell the Register to come back when the complete number had been dialled. If the first dialled digit was a zero then this would normally be routed straight to the Group Switching Centre. However, if the exchange had an Alternative Available Route say 0296 then the MCU would have to wait until enough routing digits had been received to make a routing decision. Again this AAR information was stored in the cyclic stores. Once the MCU had decided the routing, it sent a command to the Interrogator/Markers to set up the required path and also told the Register what dialled digits to forward on. Then the MCU would {{move on to the next}} task. Once the connection had been established, the Supervisory Processing Unit (SPU) took care of the path and all the call metering tasks. The MCUs had core memory to hold the dialled digits from all the Registers and also had other storage to manipulate call set-up information. There were three scan rates: 156ms for subscribers, 36ms for Registers, Outgoing Junctions and Routing Translations, and 12ms for Incoming Junctions. The last of these was obviously the quickest scan, to ensure that no incoming digits were lost from the incoming junctions. (A junction in BT terminology was not a junction in the ordinary sense of the word, but was the name given to a pair of wires connecting a call between a 'satellite' telephone exchange and the main exchange.) ...|$|E

This continues work discussed in [0] and [1] on searching for disciplined methods for developing and describing algorithms that deal with complicated data structures such as linked lists.

40|$|Scientists at Argonne (IL) National Laboratory have {{developed}} a thin-film microsensor {{that is capable of}} detecting and quantifying a wide variety of gases and gas mixtures at concentraitons as low as 1 ppm. The sensor technology is suitable for controlling boiler and flue-gas emissions, characterizing contaminated soil and air, monitoring for noxious gases, and providing early intelligent detection of toxic vapors. Intelligence comes from onboard neural network software that identifies gases by matching <b>cyclic</b> voltammograms with <b>stored</b> patterns previously obtained from standard reference samples. The sensor and the techniques used to optimize the thin films involved will be the subject of a talk given by Jim Vetrone on Tuesday aternoon at 2 : 20 p. m. in Room 1011...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to improve the heating value of gas produced during gasification of biomass fuels using an indirectly heated gasifier based on latent heat ballasting. The latent heat ballast consists of lithium fluoride salt encased in tubes suspended in the reactor. The lithium fluoride has a melting point that is near the desired gasification temperature. With the ballast a single reactor operating in a <b>cyclic</b> mode <b>stores</b> energy during a combustion phase and releases it during a pyrolysis phase. Tests were carried out in a fluidized bed reactor to evaluate the concept. The time to cool the reactor during the pyrolysis phase from 1, 172 K (1, 650 F) to 922 K (1, 200 F) increased 102 % by use of the ballast system. This extended pyrolysis time allowed 33 % more biomass to be gasified during a cycle. Additionally, the total fuel fraction pyrolyzed to produce useful gas increased from 74 [...] 80 %. Higher heating values of 14. 2 to 16. 6 MJ/Nm{sup 3 } (382 [...] 445 Btu/scf) on a dry basis were obtained from the ballasted gasifier...|$|R
40|$|We present {{parallel}} and sequential dense QR factorization algorithms {{that are}} optimized to avoid communication. Some {{of these are}} novel, and some extend earlier work. Communication includes both messages between processors (in the parallel case), and data movement between slow and fast memory (in either the sequential or parallel cases). Our first algorithm, Tall Skinny QR (TSQR), factors m × n matrices in a one-dimensional (1 -D) block <b>cyclic</b> row layout, <b>storing</b> the Q factor (if desired) implicitly as a tree of blocks of Householder reflectors. TSQR is optimized for matrices with many more rows than columns (hence the name). In the parallel case, TSQR requires {{no more than the}} minimum number of messages Θ(log P) between P processors. In the sequential case, TSQR transfers 2 mn + o(mn) words between slow and fast memory, which is the theoretical lower bound, and performs Θ(mn/W) block reads and writes (as a function of the fast memory size W), which i...|$|R
40|$|Although {{considered}} {{by many as the}} gold standard clinical measure of arterial stiffness, carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) averages material and geometric properties over {{a large portion of the}} central arterial tree. Given that such properties may evolve differentially as a function of region in cases of hypertension and aging, among other conditions, there is a need to evaluate the potential utility of cf-PWV as an early diagnostic of progressive vascular stiffening. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven fluid-solid-interaction computational model of the human aorta to simulate effects of aging-related changes in regional wall properties (e. g., biaxial material stiffness and wall thickness) and conduit geometry (e. g., vessel caliber, length, and tortuosity) on several metrics of arterial stiffness, including distensibility, augmented pulse pressure, and <b>cyclic</b> changes in <b>stored</b> elastic energy. Using the best available biomechanical data, our results for PWV compare well to findings reported for large population studies while rendering a higher resolution description of evolving local and global metrics of aortic stiffening. Our results reveal similar spatio-temporal trends between stiffness and its surrogate metrics, except PWV, thus indicating a complex dependency of the latter on geometry. Lastly, our analysis highlights the importance of the tethering exerted by external tissues, which was iteratively estimated until hemodynamic simulations recovered typical values of tissue properties, pulse pressure, and PWV for each age group...|$|R
