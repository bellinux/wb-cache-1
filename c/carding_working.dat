40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} the increasing adoption of heterogeneous wireless networks working in unlicensed ISM bands, thus creating serious problems of spectrum overcrowding. Although ZigBee, Bluetooth and WiFi networks have been natively designed for working in presence of interference, {{it has been observed}} that several performance impairments may occur because of heterogeneous sensitivity to detect or react to the presence of other technologies. In this paper we focus on the WiFi capability to detect interfering ZigBee links. Despite of the narrowband transmissions performed by ZigBee, in emerging scenarios ZigBee interference can {{have a significant impact on}} WiFi performance. Therefore, interference detection is essential for improving coexistence strategies in heterogeneous networks. In our work we show how such a detection can be performed on commodity <b>cards</b> <b>working</b> on time and frequency domain and also analysing data in the error domain. Errors are monitored and classified into error patterns observed in the network in terms of occurrence probability and temporal clustering of different error events.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} impact of {{hardware}} features of graphics cards on performance of GPU computing using GPGPU-Sim simulation software tool. GPU computing is a growing topic {{in the world of}} computing, and could be an important milestone for computers. Therefore, such a study that seeks to identify the performance bottlenecks of the program with respect to hardware parameters of the devvice can be considered an important step towards tuning devices for higher efficiency. In this work we selected convolution algorithm - a typical GPGPU application - and conducted several tests to study different performance parameters. These tests were performed on two simulated graphics cards (NVIDIA GTX 480, NVIDIA Tesla C 2050), which are supported by GPGPU-Sim. By changing the hardware parameters of graphics card such as memory cache sizes, frequency and the number of cores, we can make a fine-grained analysis on the effect of these parameters on the performance of the program. A graphics <b>card</b> <b>working</b> on a picture convolution task releis on the L 1 cache but has the worst performance with a small shared memory.

A structural equation model that assesses the relationship between the proposed variables is tested using AMOS 20.
