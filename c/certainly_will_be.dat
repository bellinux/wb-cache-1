In September 1944, Rosenberg {{suggested}} to Feklisov that he should consider recruiting his brother-in-law, David Greenglass, and his wife. On September 21, 1944, Feklisov reported to Moscow: [...] "They are young, intelligent, capable, and politically developed people, strongly believing {{in the cause of}} communism and wishing to do their best to help our country as much as possible. They are undoubtedly devoted to us." [...] David wrote to his wife: [...] "My darling, I most <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> glad {{to be part of the}} community project [...] that Julius and his friends [...] have in mind." ...|$|E
500|$|Though it was optimistic, the Restudy noted, It is {{important}} to understand that the 'restored' Everglades of the future will be different from any version of the Everglades that has existed in the past. While it <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> vastly superior to the current ecosystem, it will not completely match the pre-drainage system. This is not possible, in light of the irreversible physical changes that have made (sic) to the ecosystem. It will be an Everglades that is smaller and somewhat differently arranged than the historic ecosystem. But it will be a successfully restored Everglades, because it will have recovered those hydrological and biological patterns which defined the [...] original Everglades, and which made it unique among the world’s wetland systems. It will become a place that kindles the wildness and richness of the former Everglades.|$|E

What botanist {{would not}} be filled with admiration if, after a long journey, he should find this wonderful plant. In his astonishment past ills would be forgotten when beholding this admirable work of the Creator! ...|$|E

(21-30)--Now {{indeed they}} are saying, [...] "Let him not write or we <b>will</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> taken."4 They seek to capture Gubla, and they say, [...] "If we capture Gubla, we <b>will</b> <b>be</b> strong;"5 there <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> a man left, (and) they (the archers) <b>will</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> too few for them.6 ...|$|R

2500|$|... "Irresistible grace", {{also called}} [...] "efficacious grace", {{asserts that the}} saving grace of God is effectually applied to those whom he has {{determined}} to save (that is, the elect) and overcomes their resistance to obeying {{the call of the}} gospel, bringing them to a saving faith. This means that when God sovereignly purposes to save someone, that individual <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> saved. The doctrine holds that this purposeful influence of God's Holy Spirit cannot be resisted, but that the Holy Spirit, [...] "graciously causes the elect sinner to cooperate, to believe, to repent, to come freely and willingly to Christ." [...] This is not to deny the fact that the Spirit's outward call (through the proclamation of the Gospel) can be, and often is, rejected by sinners; rather, it's that inward call which cannot be rejected.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will be a}} beastly cold swim," [...] {{he grumbled}} to himself, [...] "but I can't see the poor little brute drowned, and drowned he <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> if no one goes in for him. It's no {{distance}} to swim, and I should think one could wade to within twenty yards of him; but it <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> horribly cold." [...] And he gave a shiver of anticipation {{as he looked at}} the smooth frozen surface.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} met his sister's {{somewhat}} peremptory eye with his bright, contented glance. [...] "Yes, it <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> pleasanter," [...] he repeated.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not {{unless they}} deserve it, Sir Thomas," [...] said Stemm. Sir Thomas could say nothing further. For our own part we {{fear that the}} maidens at the villa <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> the better in conduct, as they <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> more {{comfortable}} in their lives, in consequence of this change.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{think that}} a young man, who <b>{{certainly}}</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> looked on as the young lady's lover, {{but by no means}} so certainly as the young lady's future husband, will be more successful?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>{{certainly}}</b> <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> {{that person}} you wish for, Captain," [...] replied Tyrrel, [...] "because I {{really do not}} know {{who was in the}} right or wrong; but I am certainly sorry that you should have met with ill usage, when your purpose was to visit me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{it keeps}} on it <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a blizzard," [...] put in Roger. [...] "In one {{way we can}} be glad we are under shelter, even though we are a good many miles from home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You put it so kindly," [...] {{she said}} gratefully, [...] "that I am afraid I cannot refuse. You are very, very considerate, Mr. Draconmeyer. It <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> nicer to owe {{you the money}} than a stranger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must get}} {{accustomed}} to them, my dear, {{so that when}} you find your own people, you will not be stiff and awkward; as you <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> when you dress in English fashion for the first time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{best thing}} <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{to pass the}} time as cheerfully as we can; and that <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> in waiting out here, in this bitter cold. I have, fortunately, a few bottles of {{excellent}} wine in the car; so I propose, gentlemen, that we go in to a fire, have a glass of wine, and smoke a cigar, tranquilly." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I know it, daughter. Question me no more. As for his stillness, it is {{that which}} follows a heavy blow. Perhaps it may hold him fast many days, since <b>certainly</b> he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> sick for long. Yet fear nothing; he will live." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} it very probable, and you <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> successful. They like American young ladies very much over here; they show them {{a great deal}} of kindness. But you mustn't feel too much at home, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear sir, it {{is painful}} {{for me to}} discuss it, but if the money is not paid on the 14th, there <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> no {{marriage}} on the 18th." [...] His insufferable smile was more complacent than ever.|$|E
6000|$|So when Danny Meadow Mouse {{sent for}} him and whispered in his ear Cresty the Fly-catcher smiled broadly and winked knowingly. [...] "I <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> there, Danny Meadow Mouse, I <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> there," [...] said he. And he was there. He had hidden in a tree close by the big tussock of grass, behind which Peter Rabbit had planned to place Mr. Blacksnake's old suit so as to scare Danny Meadow Mouse. His eyes had sparkled when he saw what a fine big suit it was. [...] "My, but this will save {{me a lot of}} trouble," [...] said he to himself. [...] "It's the finest old suit I've ever seen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} no objection," [...] she replied; [...] "for though I should not {{particularly}} dislike the part of Amelia if well supported, that is, if everything went well, I shall be sorry to be an inconvenience; but as they do not chuse to hear your advice at that table" [...] (looking round), [...] "it <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> taken." ...|$|R
5000|$|Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin did {{not rule}} out the idea of honouring the aid workers, saying [...] "Humanitarian workers are special people.

6000|$|... "Glad of it? Not I, for one. Yet {{all else}} will fail unless you bestir {{yourself}} {{in the next three}} days. Condillac is as good as lost to you already, since Florimond is upon the threshold. La Vauvraye most <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> lost to you as well unless you make haste to snatch it in the little moment that is left you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] said Paddy again. [...] "That {{certainly}} is the foot print of Old Man Coyote! I see I {{have got to}} watch out more sharply than I had thought for. All right, Mr. Coyote; now that I know you are about, you'll have to be smarter than I think you are to catch me. You <b>certainly</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> back here tonight looking for me, so I think I'll do my cutting {{right now in the}} daytime." ...|$|E
