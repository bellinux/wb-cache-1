500|$|Host–parasite {{coevolution}} is the coevolution of a {{host and}} a parasite. A general characterization of many viruses, obligate parasites, is that they coevolved alongside their respective hosts. Correlated mutations between the two species enter them into an evolution arms race. Whichever organism, host or parasite, that cannot {{keep up with the}} other will be eliminated from their habitat, as the species with the higher average population fitness survives. This race is known as the Red Queen hypothesis. The Red Queen hypothesis predicts that sexual reproduction allows a host to stay just ahead of its parasite, similar to the Red Queen's race in Through the Looking-Glass: [...] "it takes all the running you <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> in the same place". The host reproduces sexually, producing some offspring with immunity over its parasite, which then evolves in response.|$|E

Parks (OP-20-GY) sent by Leitwiler states, [...] "We have stopped {{work on the}} period 1 February to 31 July as we have all we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with the current period. We are reading enough current traffic to keep two translators very busy." [...] Another document, Exhibit No. 151 (Memoranda from Captain L. F. Safford) from the Hewitt Inquiry has {{a copy of the}} U.S. Navy message OPNAV-242239 'Evaluation of Messages of 26 November 1941' which has in part: '1. Reference (a) advised that Com 16 {{intercepts}} were considered most reliable and requested Com 16 to evaluate reports on Japanese naval movements and send dispatch to OPNAV, info CINCPAC. Com 16's estimates were more reliable than Com 14's, not only because of better radio interception, but because Com 16 was currently reading messages in the Japanese Fleet Cryptographic System ("5-number code" [...] or [...] "JN25") and was exchanging technical information and Japanese-to-English translations with the British C. I. Unit at Singapore. Lt. Cdr. Arthur H. McCollum was aware of this, and it may have been part of his thinking when he drafted the McCollum memo. Duane L. Whitlock, traffic analyst at CAST, was not aware before the attack IJN movement traffic code was being read. [...] "Reading" [...] in this context means being able to see the underlying code groups, not breaking out the messages into usable plaintext. The Hewitt Inquiry document also states, [...] "The [...] "5 numeral system" [...] (JN-25B) yielded no information which would arouse even a suspicion of the Pearl Harbor raid, either before or afterward." ...|$|E
