In order to estimate the thermal coefficients, the model introduced by Ghosh [1] is applied. Our calculation show that the thermal coefficient extracted for the chromatic dispersion, its slope, and the zero dispersion wavelength swing are − 1. 21 × 10 − 3 ps/km/nm / ◦ C, + 2. 96 × 10 − 3 ps/km/nm 2 / ◦ C, and + 3. 33 × 10 − 2 nm / ◦ C at 1. 55 µm respectively.

The first event occurred immediately before 508 A. D. while the second happened in 801 A. D. Two other earthquakes during this period (618 A. D. and 847 A.

Available information is not conclusive {{about the age of}} the earthquake {{responsible for the}} displacement of the channels although geological, historical and archaeological data indicate it is most likely related to the 508 A.

Taking into account that the paleoseismological analysis has highlighted a close similarity between the surface faulting pattern of this event and the one that occurred in 1915, the former may be a "twin" of the latter...|$|E

Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) {{are one of}} the key components of the ubiquitous flexible electronics in the near future. Since the first report in the mid- 1980 s, OFETs have been intensively studied for more than 20 years. However, most of these studies are based on steady state or quasi steady state DC measurements, which are not sensitive to transient processes including the formation and depletion of the conducting channel. These transient processes are essential parts of the device operation, and determine the response frequency of OFETs. For these reasons, the transient carrier behaviors during these processes warrant examination. This thesis develops displacement current measurement (DCM) as a technique to probe transient carrier behaviors. Instead of using OFETs for measuring displacement current, long-channel capacitors (LCCs) are used. A LCC {{can be viewed as a}} simplified OFET with only one channel contact to limit the carrier injection/extraction to one direction only. The channel of a LCC is elongated to millimeter range to increase the transient time and the displacement current associated with charging/discharging the <b>channel.</b> <b>Displacement</b> current has been measured from LCCs under cyclic gate voltage sweeps. The number of the injected, extracted, and trapped carriers can be calculated by integrating the displacement current with respect to time. A current peak has always been observed in the charging sweep, and it is attributed to the transient process of conducting channel formation. Analytical and numerical device models have been developed to understand the transient carrier behaviors. It is found that carrier mobility can be calculated from the slope of the displacement current peak. In addition, the evolution of the carrier distribution in the long channel during the conducting channel formation and depletion are presented in detail. Further more, the effects of carrier traps on the transient carrier behaviors are discussed. DCM has also been used to study the contact effects at metal-pentacene interfaces. It is found that the carrier trapping in the long channel of the LCCs with Au contacts is indirectly caused by the deep trap states at the pentacene-dielectric interface in the contact region generated by Au penetration. Low trapped carrier density is found in the LCCs with Cu contacts due to the shallow penetration of Cu atoms. In addition, ambipolar injection and transport are observed in a LCC with Al contact and a PMMA buffer layer between pentacene and SiO 2. Thus DCM can be used to characterize the quality of metal-organic contacts. The conducting channel depletion dynamics under constant gate voltages has also been examined. It is found that the discharging displacement current can either follow an exponential decay or a power law decay, depending on the discharging gate voltage. A simple RC model has been given to explain these different decay behaviors. For the power law decay, the decay exponent measured from the experimental data is around 1. 2 to 1. 3, while the exponent predicted by the RC model is 2. The smaller exponent observed in experiment might be attributed to the effect of carrier traps...|$|E

40|$|L-type {{voltage-gated}} calcium channels play {{a central}} role in providing the influx of calcium that stimulates electrical activity and insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells. Cav 1. 2 and Cav 1. 3 are the two L-type channels that are present in β cells and insulin-secreting cell lines; however the defined role that each channel has in contributing to the electrical activity that drives insulin secretion remains to be fully understood. Cav 1. 2 and Cav 1. 3 share much similarity in amino acid sequence, yet there is a higher sequence divergence in the intracellular loops that connect the homologous transmembrane domains of the α 1 pore-forming subunit. The intracellular loop connecting domains II and III (II-III loop) of Cav 1. 2 and Cav 1. 3 share only about 40 % amino acid sequence identity, making this region one of the most divergent regions of the channel. The II-III loop region of voltage-gated calcium channels has been highly studied regarding its function as a site for protein-protein interactions which positions the calcium channels in signaling complexes that modulate neurotransmitter and hormone release. ^ To investigate the role of the Cav II-III loop in β cells, we stably expressed the II-III loop portion of each channel in INS- 1 pancreatic β cells and created stable INS- 1 cell lines called Cav 1. 2 /II-III cells (II-III loop of Cav 1. 2 expressed) and Cav 1. 3 /II-III cells (II-III loop of Cav 1. 3 expressed). We have previously reported that Cav 1. 2 and Cav 1. 3 are localized to lipid raft regions and that expressing the II-III loop peptide of either channel specifically displaces the respective channel out of lipid rafts. Displacement of Ca v 1. 2 or Cav 1. 3 could have functional consequences for the electrical activity that initiates and regulates insulin secretion. ^ I measured whole-cell voltage-gated calcium channel activity and K ATP channel activity in INS- 1, Cav 1. 2 /II-III, and Ca v 1. 3 /II-III cells to determine if there was any effect of <b>channel</b> <b>displacement</b> from lipid rafts on ion channel activity. I examined the current-voltage relationship of voltage-gated calcium channels and observed no difference in the three cell lines, suggesting that the endogenous channels are still activated in their normal membrane potential threshold range. In the Cav 1. 2 /II-III cells, the whole-cell IBa density was actually significantly greater compared to INS- 1 and Cav 1. 3 /II-III cells. I measured KATP channel activity and modulation by diazoxide and sulfonylureas in each cell line. I did not detect a significant difference in tolbutamide sensitivity of KATP channel currents or gliclazide sensitivity of KATP channel-mediated membrane depolarization. Displacement of Cav 1. 2 or Cav 1. 3 does not diminish voltage-gated calcium channel activity or affect the function of the KATP channel. ^ I used the perforated-patch clamp recording configuration to measure glucose induced depolarization and action potentials in INS- 1, Cav 1. 2 /II-III, and Cav 1. 3 /II-III cells to determine if there was an effect of Cav 1. 2 or Cav 1. 3 being displaced from lipid rafts. I determined that there was no significant difference in the level of depolarization induced by 18 mM glucose in each cell line, supporting my previous observations that the activity of voltage-gated calcium channels and the KATP channel in these cells has not been compromised. I observed that displacement of Cav 1. 2 or Cav 1. 3 affected action potential spiking in the Cav 1. 2 /II-III, and Cav 1. 3 /II-III cells. There was an increase in frequency of action potentials in the Cav 1. 2 /II-III cells compared to INS- 1 cells, suggesting Cav 1. 2 is integral for contributing to the Ca 2 + signal that leads to SK channel activation for regulation of action potential frequency. I also observed a decrease in frequency of action potentials in the Cav 1. 3 /II-III cells compared to the INS- 1 cells, suggesting Cav 1. 3 is integral for contributing to the Ca 2 + signal that is required for induction of action potentials. These observations provide evidence for coupling of Cav 1. 2 or Cav 1. 3 to mechanisms of action potential regulation in pancreatic β cells. ...|$|E

The vessel was fabricated from an 11. 5 -ft diameter cylindrical shell, 1. 5 in thick, and 2 : 1 elliptical ends, 2 in thick. Prior to delivery and acceptance, three types of tests were required for proof testing the vessel: a hydrostatic pressure test, air leak tests, and two full design charge explosion tests. The hydrostatic pressure test provided an initial static check on the capacity of the vessel and functioning of the strain instrumentation. The pneumatic air leak tests were performed before, in between, and after the explosion tests.

We have studied nuclear division in the dinoflagellate Gyrodinium cohnii (Schiller), using cells obtained from cultures undergoing phasic growth.

Metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) utilizing Ge channels have demonstrated dramatic performance enhancements over Si based technology. Theoretical studies have predicted that tensile strain enhances both electron and hole mobilities of Ge to levels much greater than those in unstrained or compressively-strained Ge and Si. Additionally, high enough levels of tensile strain have been postulated to alter the band structure of Ge to make Ge a direct-band-gap semiconductor. We investigated the physics and fabrication of Ge/III-V compound heterostructures, where the III-V compound material {{could serve as a}} tensile-strain-inducing template for subsequent Ge epitaxy. Through experimentation and the use of characterization techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and spreading resistance analysis (SRA), we established correlations between the initial III-V compound surface stoichiometry and the structural, optical, and electronic properties of Ge thin films deposited on GaAs and AlAs templates. We determined that the highest structural quality Ge epitaxy initiates via a bond and exchange mechanism with the surface group III element atoms, whereas group V element atoms do not bond as effectively with Ge and thin film deposition processes that rely on Ge-group V binding processes lead to 'pitting' in Ge thin films. With the developed understanding of the growth mechanisms, we successfully fabricated high quality tensile-strained Ge thin films and quantum dots on InxGaixAs templates. Tensile strain levels as high as 0. 58 % in Ge thin films and 1. 37 % in Ge quantum dots were achieved. However, the film deposition methods that facilitated the highest structural quality also led to unintentional doping characteristics that affected the electrical and optical properties of the tensile-strained Ge epitaxial structures. Nevertheless, we designed processing sequences that led to the first demonstration of room temperature, Ge direct band gap luminescence from Ge/III-V compound heterostructures. We parlayed our advancements in Ge/Ill-V compound heterostructure fabrication to demonstrate a novel process for the fabrication of GaAs-on-Insulator (GaAsOI). The combination of GaAs/Ge/GaAs heterostructure establishment, room temperature oxide-oxide bonding methods, and XeF 2 -based sacrificial etching of Ge, led to the successful fabrication of GaAsOI on a small scale. We tested the implementation of our process on a full wafer scale and determined the process was kinetically limited by the lateral Ge etch process. We adapted the Deal-Grove oxidation model to establish a model to understand the relationships between lateral etch rate, lateral etch distance, release layer thickness, <b>channel</b> <b>displacements,</b> and the radius of curvature of the donor wafer.

If a station was not able to find a <b>displacement</b> <b>channel,</b> it runs the risk of losing its license.|$|R
40|$|Texture {{synthesis}} and morphing {{are important}} techniques for efficiently creating realistic and visually attractive textures. A popular class of synthesis algorithm are pixel-based techniques, which search {{in a given}} 2 D exemplar for a pixel with a similar neighbourhood to the pixel currently being generated. The methods have the advantage that they are fast, they can be easily generalised to higher dimensions, and synthesised textures can be represented as references to the exemplar which allows definition of additional <b>channels,</b> such as <b>displacement</b> maps, at no additional cost. The quality of pixel-based techniques depends on the metric used to compare pixel neighbourhoods. Lefebvre and Hoppe introduced the term appearance space for measures describing pixel neighbourhood similarity. In this paper we introduce new appearance space attributes and evaluate them and existing attributes for texture synthesis and morphing. Our results show that our proposed gradient estimate significantly improves synthesis and morphing quality with little additional cost...|$|R
40|$|Norbormide (NRB) is {{a unique}} {{compound}} that acts directly on rat vascular myocytes to trigger a contractile process, through an as yet unknown mechanism, which results in the selective contraction of rat peripheral arteries. To gain insight into the mechanisms involved in NRB rat-selective activity, we investigated the subcellular distribution of NRB-AF 12, a nitrobenzodiazole (NBD) -derivative of NRB, in living NRB-sensitive and NRB-insensitive cells. In both cell types, NRB-AF 12 localised to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, lysosomes and endosomes; however, in NRB-sensitive cells, the fluorescence also extended to the plasma membrane. NRB-AF 12 was rapidly internalised into the cells, could easily be washed out and then reloaded back into the same cells, all {{with a high degree}} of reproducibility. Cells exposed for 24 h to NRB-AF 12 did not show apparent signs of toxicity, even at concentrations of the dye (10 µM) much higher than those required for fluorescence labelling (500 ηM). The distribution pattern of NRB-AF 12 fluorescence was near identical to that of ER-Tracker® (Er-Tr), a fluorescent derivative of glibenclamide, a known KATP <b>channel</b> blocker. <b>Displacement</b> tests did not demonstrate, but at the same time did not rule out the possibility of a common target for ER-Tr, NRB-AF 12, NRB and glibenclamide. On the basis of these results we hypothesize a common target site for NRB-AF 12 and ER-Tr, and a similar target profile for norbormide and glibenclamide, and propose NRB-AF 12 as an alternative fluorescence probe to ER-Tracker. Furthermore, NRB-based fluorescence derivatives could be designed to selectively label single cellular structures...|$|R
40|$|In this research, the {{secondary}} current theory {{is used in}} investigating the role of phase shift angle between {{the secondary}} current and the <b>channel</b> axis <b>displacement</b> in stability analysis of a river channel. To achieve this, a small-perturbation stability analysis is developed for investigation {{of the role of}} the secondary current accompanying channel curvature in the initiation and early development of meanders in open channels. The secondary currents are generating in planes perpendicular to the primary direction of motion. The secondary currents form a helical motion in which the water in the upper part of the river is driven outward, whereas the water near the bottom is driven inward in a bend. Force-momentum equations for longitudinal and transverse direction in open channel bends were utilized. Assuming that the transverse force contributed by the bed is negligible, the pressure force associated with the transverse surface inclination is balanced by the centripetal force. Existing equations of the transverse velocity profile were analyzed. Since the magnitude of the vertical velocity is negligible compared to the transverse velocity in secondary currents, this study concentrates on the transverse velocity which is the radial component of the secondary current. This formulation leads to a linear differential equation which is solved for its orthogonal components which give the rates of meander growth and downstream migration. It is shown that instability increases with decrease in phase shift angle. Transition from straight to meandering and then from meandering to braiding occurs when phase shift angle is reduced. </p...|$|R
