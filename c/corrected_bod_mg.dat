Following a 24 h starving period, the return activated sludge and mixed liquor sludges reported the highest oxidative degradation of a standard glucose/glutamic acid (GGA) mixture and the return activated sludge also recorded the lowest endogenous FM-respiration rate. Dynamic working ranges up to 170 <b>mg</b> <b>BOD</b> 5 L- 1 for OECD standard solutions and 300 <b>mg</b> <b>BOD</b> 5 L- 1 for GGA were obtained.

Such high loads of untreated wastewater impacted water quality in the Nhue River where DO decreased at times to as low as 1 mg O 2 /l. The accumulation of particulate organic matter and micro-organisms in the sediments of the Nhue represented substantial sources of nutrients and sinks for DO. They are also considerable production of dissolved carbon dioxide at concentrations up to two orders of magnitude higher than pressure. Such pressures (EpCO 2) are expected in polluted environments, but the results presented here are new for Vietnam and much of developing countries. A number of factors linked to field monitoring and laboratory measurements clearly indicate the importance of autotrophic over heterotrophic biological processes and sediments. An ecological model for management purposes has been developed that reliably estimates of the pollutant loads. An opportunity was taken to examine the changing impacts and processes when the To Lich was diverted from the Nhue. The monitoring and modelling of this opportunity showed low dissolved oxygen levels even if the impact from the To Lich was lessened. Alternatives are proposed to alleviate problems of water quality in the Nhue.

40|$|Abstract Performance of a {{rotating}} biological contactor (RBC) in treating municipal wastewater from primary sedimentation basin and anaerobically treated industrial effluent from an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was investigated. The 280 -L six-stage RBC pilot was operated at different organic loading rates and biodisc speeds. The overall removal efficiencies of soluble BOD decreased with increasing organic loading rates. Disk rotational speed did not have significant effect on performance in the range studied. The results showed that satisfactory treatment of UASB effluent to meet regulatory requirement for agricultural purposes (effluent <b>BOD</b> of 100 <b>mg</b> L- 1) can be achieved with sufficient margin of safety at organic loading rate of up to 4. 9 ± 0. 4 g SBOD m- 2 d- 1 with SBOD removal efficiency of 59 ± 9 %. For municipal wastewater, {{it was possible to}} achieve SBOD effluent values of below 20 mg L- 1 all the time. Most of the organics were removed in the first three stages with minimal contribution from the remaining stages of the RBC reactor. There was a decrease in SBOD removal efficiency to 74 ± 3 % at OLR value of 17. 8 ± 2. 1 g SBOD m- 2 d- 1 and 66 ± 6 % at OLR value of 4. 7 ± 1. 9 g SBOD m- 2 d- 1 for UASB effluent and municipal wastewater, respectively. The results for elimination capacity (EC) values indicated a linear relationship with first-stage organic loading rates without any signs of limitation in the range of OLR values investigated i...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Debris from {{construction}} or demolition/deconstruction processes have no {{significant impact on}} the environment as they are res-usable and inert. This has been also long admitted for solid waste generated by the demolition of damaged cities following violent earthquakes. Approach: This study is a contribution to the assessment of actual impact on the quality of groundwater of buried demolition debris from the city of Boumerdes, in the North of Algeria 5 years after the May 21 st 2003 earthquake hit the region. The public discharge of Boumerdes city {{has been used as a}} temporary landfill. It is located about 5 km downtown of Boumerdes at the Tidjelabine site which is marly-calcareous formation. Leachate from the landfill was directly rejected in the receiving environment, where the soil is marly-calcareous type with cracks giving a variable permeability (10 − 2 m sec− 1 to nearly 10 − 6 m sec− 1) that facilitates infiltration of potential pollutants to the groundwater. The slope character (from 5 - 10 %) of the field contributes to pollutants movement and may accentuate water quality deterioration. Three domestic wells (designated S 1, S 2 and S 3) were selected in the vicinity of the landfill and served as piezometers. Leachate samples were taken from the landfill and evaluated. Results: Leachate analysis indicated organic matter with relatively high COD (1136 mg L− 1 O 2) and <b>BOD</b> 5 (200 <b>mg</b> L− 1 O 2); whereas the pH yielded 7. 65 thus indicating fermentation phase of th...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{treatment}} of waste water from a corn freezing process by activated sludge with the aid of alum coagulation was investigated. Both high and low energy level systems were observed with good flocculation occurring at the low energy level. Because poor flocculation occurs at high energy level conditions, alum was added to aid in floe formation. The effects of alum on the treatment system and the biological treatability of the waste were studied. The treatability of the waste, with respect to the reduction of Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Total Solids, and Volatile Solids, was related to alum dosage, detention time, and solids content in the aerator. Detention times of 24, 16, 10, and 6 hours with alum dosages of 0, 50, 100, and 200 milligrams per day per liter of aerator volume were used. The following conclusions were reached. 1. The waste water investigated may be biologically treated to reduce the organic content by an activated sludge system. 2. The addition of alum to the aeration system produces an effluent low in organic content with a shorter detention time than that required without the use of alum. 3. The removal of total solids and volatile solids follow trends similar to the removal of BOD with the solids reduction being less efficient. 4. The reduction rates for the total solids and the volatile solids are essentially the same for similar aerator conditions. 5. Under the conditions of this investigation the maximum reduction rate for the BOD was approximately 1. 7 <b>mg</b> <b>BOD</b> reduced/mg MLVS/day...|$|R
40|$|About 30 % of Minnesotans use on-site {{systems for}} {{wastewater}} treatment (~ 500, 000 residences). Unfortunately, 55 - 70 % are failing {{or out of}} compliance with state standards. Homeowners and small businesses require cost-effective options in locations with restrictive soil and site conditions. In particular, many sites occur near lakes and streams creating a health hazard and deteriorating water quality. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are one option being evaluated and this paper addresses CWs as a viable wastewater treatment option in Minnesota based on experiences at three research sites, encompassing 5 subsurface flow wetlands from 1995 - 2000. These are small flow (< 1000 gpd) subsurface flow gravel beds located at the Northeast Regional Correction Center (NERCC), Grand Lake, and Lake Washington, MN. Performance monitoring shows that CWs are a viable, year-round onsite treatment option. The systems were generally able to achieve design criteria of 30 <b>mg</b> <b>BOD</b> 5 /L, 25 mg TSS/L and 200 fecal cfu/ 100 mL, although the NERCC CWs required 30 cm. of unsaturated soil to achieve consistent disinfection. High strength (~ 300 mg BOD/L and 100 mg TN/L) influent at NERCC probably limited system performance, particularly N-removal which was ~ 40 % in summer and ~ 20 % in winter (mass-based). Declining P-removal at the oldest sites suggest substrate saturation. Although CWs remain a viable option for homeowners in terms of performance, ease of operation, and cost, other issues relate to inconsistent vegetation growth (affecting performance and freezing), and meeting concentration-based regulatory standards since they may exhibit substantial variability due to rain events, partial freezing, spring snowmelt, and summer evapotranspiration...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{configuration}} of vertical downflow constructed wetland {{was used to}} treat up to 75 m 3 per day of sugar beet processing wastewaters. The 403 m 2, two-stage pilot system included planted and unplanted cells {{of a variety of}} sand depths (0. 15 - 0. 4 m) and sand particle size distributions (d 10 = 0. 07 - 1. 2 mm). The hydraulic regime of each bed was also manipulated. Typical beet processing wastewaters contained 235 <b>mg</b> <b>BOD</b> l- 1, 45 mg NH 4 -N l- 1, 0. 03 mg PO 4 -P l- 1, 16 mg TSS l- 1, at pH 8. 2 and 29 °C. Overall performance of the pilot system, with respect to BOD, NH 4 -N, and TSS removal, was similar to, or better than, comparable two-stage vertical flow wetland systems. In vertical flow systems, influent BOD concentrations > 600 mg l- 1 were coincident with reduced rates of nitrification. Mean BOD removal rate in the pilot system was 38. 8 g BOD m- 2 d- 1, with a mean loading rate of 40. 4 g BOD m- 2 d- 1. The first-order reaction rate for BOD removal was calculated to be 0. 369 m d- 1 over the whole system. High rates of oxygen transfer and efficient removal of organic solids were seen as the most important factors enhancing BOD removal. Mean NH 4 -N removal rate in the pilot system was 5. 6 g NH 4 -N m- 2 d- 1, with a mean loading rate of 7. 3 g NH 4 -N m- 2 d- 1.

40|$|A novel {{design of}} a {{biochemical}} oxygen demand (BOD) biosensor has been developed for on-line monitoring of easily biodegradable organic compounds in aqueous samples. The biological recognition element of the sensor could be easily renewed by injecting new bacterial paste without disassembling the sensor system. The sensor measurements were {{carried out in the}} initial-rate mode using a flow injection (FI) system, resulting in 60 s for one sample analysis followed by a recovery time less than 10 min. The sensor performance achieved showed a wide detection linearity over the range of 5 - 700 <b>mg</b> <b>BOD</b> 5. 1 (- 1) and a generally good agreement between the BOD values estimated by the biosensor and the conventional 5 -day test. Furthermore, the precision test was in the control range (i. e. repeatability less than or equal to+/- 7. 5 %, reproducibility less than or equal to+/- 7. 3 %). The sensor could be used over 1 week in continuous test, however, the best performance was found within the first 24 h where standard deviation of the sensor response was +/- 2. 4 %. The design of the sensor allows easy and fast renewal of the cells used as sensing elements. Replacement of biological recognition element and calibration of the sensor responses can be performed in a rather simple procedure on a daily regular basis. By using a mixed culture as the bio-receptor, one gets a sensor that reacts {{to a wide range of}} substrates. The new sensor construction will thus allow fast and convenient replacement of the bio-receptor and on-line assay of a broad range of substrates. This makes the sensor being an interesting and promising candidate for on-line monitoring of biological treatment process. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

These are of a high strength and acidic nature. To maintain practical constraints on the project a real waste water was used. The waste water is low in suspended material, has a high organic matter concentration giving a COD of 70000 to 90000 mg/l (BOD 5 14250 mg/l and a pH of 4. 5 to 5. 0. Two experimental anaerobic filter units were constructed of glass cylinders packed with glass 'Raschig' rings as the inert support matrix, and used in the trials. A statistically designed experimental programme was used to test the effects of inflent substrate concentration, hydraulic retention time, temperature and filter unit on the filter response variables. Substrate concentrations of 5500 to 47200 mg COD/l (1000 to 9000 <b>mg</b> <b>BOD</b> 5 /l) and hydraulic retention times of 1 to 5 days were used which gave rise to organic loading rates of 1. 15 to 47. 2 kg COD/m 3 d (0. 2 to 9. 0 kg BOD 5 /m 3 d). Empirical models were derived from the response data, using multiple regression techniques, and describe COD removal rate, total gas production, methane production and conversion of COD to methane in terms of the independent process variables. Results showed that the anaerobic filter achieved COD removals of 34 to 65 percent with corresponding conversions of 24 to 78 percent efficiency to methane at loadings of up to 47. 2 kg COD/m 3 d.

40|$|Control of Solids Retention Time (SRT) in the {{activated}} sludge process {{is critical for}} ensuring effective wastewater treatment. SRT sets {{the growth rate of}} microorganisms in the {{activated sludge}} process, thereby selecting the microbial composition of the mixed liquor and its settling and treatment properties. The industry has developed various methods to control activated sludge. This study evaluated seven (7) methods to calculate SRT and implemented a simple, straightforward hydraulic control of SRT method. The study was conducted at the 34 mgd Seneca WWTP in Eagan, MN, which operates a plug-flow nitrifying activated sludge process with reduced air-flows in initial zones to enhance phosphorus removal. Hydraulic control of SRT is based on a solids mass balance over the aeration tanks and clarifiers. Specifically, it depends on the influent wastewater forward flow rate into the aeration tanks, the clarifier underflow rate, the waste sludge flow rate and aeration tank volume in service. It eliminates the need for costly TSS sampling at various points in the process, along with its associated measurement variation and time lags. During this study, hydraulic control produced an SRT that agreed with conventional estimation methods, i. e. mass under aeration divided by mass flow rate wasted, when the conventional methods were corrected for solids inventory in the clarifiers. Hydraulic control of SRT provides a simple, real-time calculation to adjust wasting flow rates of return sludge to maintain a target SRT and a stable microbial population. At the Seneca WWTP, hydraulic control of SRT, combined with gently air-mixed inlet aeration zones, simplified process control, reduced O&M costs, and produced an excellent effluent quality that averaged 4. 6 mg/l TSS, 3. 6 mg/l <b>BOD,</b> 0. 58 <b>mg</b> / l total phosphorus and 0. 14 mg/l ammonia...|$|R
40|$|Reclaimed {{wastewater}} use {{is crucial}} for increasing water availability, improving water resources management, minimising environmental pollution and permitting sustainable nutrient recycling. However, wastewater also contains microbiological and chemical pollutants posing risks to {{human health and the}} environment, and these risks have to be handled. Successful use of reclaimed wastewater requires stringent standards for its treatment, disposal and distribution. This report summarises global and country-specific wastewater quality standards for different reclaimed wastewater use schemes, discusses specific standards and describes reclaimed wastewater use applications in two selected countries, Spain and Abu Dhabi Emirate. The World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater for Agriculture focus on the protection of public health. The European Commission does not directly regulate wastewater use, but discharge of treated wastewater into water bodies is regulated by Council Directive 91 / 271 /EEC, which requires treated wastewater to have a maximum of 25 <b>mg</b> <b>BOD</b> 5 /L, 125 mg COD/L and 35 - 60 mg total solids (TS) /L. In sensitive areas, sewage treatment plant effluent must comply with a maximum of 2 mg total phosphorus/L and 15 mg total nitrogen/L. EU Council Directive 2008 / 105 /EC also sets environmental quality standards for priority substances, i. e. pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenolic compounds and volatile organic compounds. In Spain, the EU directives and Royal Decree 1620 / 2007 regulate use of reclaimed wastewater. The Royal Decree sets quality criteria for microbial parameters, solids and turbidity for different applications. The Regulation and Standards Bureau (RSB) of Abu Dhabi Emirate sets the quality criteria for water discharging to marine and land environments and used for irrigation. These include limits for organic matter, solids, nutrient, pathogen indicators and helminths. In Spain, agriculture is the largest sector for reclaimed wastewater use, consuming approx. 350 Mm 3 /year.

40|$|Dairy {{farming in}} Ireland generates an {{effluent}} known as dairy soiled water (DSW), {{which consists of}} a relatively dilute mixture of cow faeces, urine, spilt milk and detergents that is typically applied to grassland. However, relatively {{little is known about}} the volumes generated, nutrient content and management factors that influence volume and concentration. Sixty dairy farms that had a separate storage tank for storing DSW were selected for this study. The spatial distribution of the farms reflected the spatial distribution of dairy cows across the 26 counties of the Republic of Ireland, with each farm representing between 10, 000 and 20, 000 dairy cows. Samples were analysed for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), ammonium N (NH 4 -N), total nitrogen (TN), potassium (K), phosphorus (molybdate-reactive and total) (MRP and TP) and dry matter (DM) content. Management characteristics and parlour properties were quantified. Factors influencing volume and concentration of DSW were determined using mixed model multiple regression analysis. On average, 9784 l (standard error 209 l) of DSW, including rainfall, was produced cow− 1 year− 1 and this contained significant quantities of total N, P and K (587, 80 and 568 mg l− 1, respectively). A typical Irish dairy farm stocked at 1. 9 cows ha− 1 could therefore supply approximately 13, 2 and 12 kg ha− 1 of total N, P and K, respectively, across the farm, annually to meet some of the nutrient requirements for herbage production and potentially replace some of the synthetic fertilizer use. Seventy one percent of samples were within the regulated concentration limits of soiled water for <b>BOD</b> (< 2500 <b>mg</b> l− 1), rising to 87 % during the closed period for slurry spreading (mid October to mid-late January), while 81 % were within the concentration limits for DM (< 1 % DM), rising to 94 % during the closed period. The efficiency of a milking parlour (cows per unit, time taken) plays a key role in determining the volume of DSW generated. This, in turn, also influences the concentration of nutrients and other chemicals. Large variability was found in nutrient concentrations and this presents a challenge for effective nutrient management to maximise the fertilizer replacement value of DSW. peer-reviewe...|$|R
