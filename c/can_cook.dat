Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean and suspect that an {{intruder}} has invaded their home. The dwarfs find Snow White upstairs, asleep across three of their beds. Snow White awakes to find the dwarfs at her bedside and introduces herself, {{and all of the}} dwarfs eventually welcome her into their home after they learn she <b>can</b> <b>cook</b> and clean beautifully. Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day, and at night they all sing, play music and dance.|$|E

500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four, {{calling it a}} disappointment. Vitaris heavily criticized Mulder's line: [...] "I'm not a psychologist"—reportedly an ad lib from Duchovny himself—noting that it {{undermines}} established continuity within the series including the character's background in psychology. Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, praises the installment, saying, [...] "Place a devil in the plot and I'll follow you {{to see what you}} <b>can</b> <b>cook</b> up.... I enjoyed this tale of a devil looking to be just a normal dad immensely." [...] In his view the episode showed a return to the earlier horror-based narratives the series was known for; though he praises the casting of Campbell, he writes that moments between Mulder and Scully are lacking.|$|E

500|$|Beyondte Technology, {{based in}} Shenzhen Province, China, began {{development}} of the Robo French fry machine in 2008, which delivers hot French fries in around 95 seconds. Beyondte Technology was acquired by Breaktime Solutions in Belgium. The machine was developed by Belgian entrepreneurs, and field tested in Brussels, Belgium {{during the summer of}} 2012. The machine weighs 750 pounds, and <b>can</b> <b>cook</b> French fries in beef fat or cooking oil. Breaktime Solutions adapted the machine to operate using beef fat, the development of which took a year. It requires manual servicing and cleaning after around 150 orders are prepared. Later developments included installation of a ventilation system that uses three filters to reduce odors emitting from the machine. The New York Post has referred to the Robo French fry machine as the [...] "Rolls Royce of vending machines." [...] In August 2013, an order of French fries from the machine was priced at USD $3.50. Customers can choose an accompaniment of mayonnaise or ketchup, and can optionally add harissa, all of which are provided in single-serving packets. The machine also dispenses a small fork.|$|E

(Incidentally several actors and actresses connected to Disney {{have appeared in the}} Disney-produced Grey's Anatomy, broadcast on a Disney-owned network.) Those characters also frequently watch movies from Netflix, at that time an online DVD rental service; the company is referenced in one of the episode's semi-parodies of a Jonas Brothers song [...] "I've Got a Ring" [...] (which parodies [...] "SOS"): [...] "Who needs sex and drugs and partying when we <b>can</b> <b>cook</b> a meal and sit around and watch Netflix?" [...] T.G.I. Friday's, a real-life American restaurant chain, is referenced several times as the place where Tammy gave her ex-boyfriend a blowjob. A can of Dr. Pepper appears repeatedly in the South Park Elementary cafeteria; David Hiltgrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer said of the product placement, [...] "I never thought I'd see this type of crass commercialism turn up on South Park, which may be the most brazenly iconoclastic show TV has ever seen." ...|$|E

[...] "I hear young women going 'well if he can buy me something'", Ndegéocello explained. [...] "That song—'Put It in the Bag'—which is based on 'can you buy me some things?' And then the male counterpart, all he can really talk about is sex and if the woman <b>can</b> <b>cook.</b> And it’s funny to me. That you're {{no more than a}} whore, you just have a wedding ring." [...] "Bright Shiny Morning" [...] was titled after the book of the same name by James Frey. Ndegéocello wrote the song after reflecting on her past lies and misrepresentations, particularly those she made in an attempt to be accepted in the music industry. [...] "People change themselves", she said. [...] "Almost in the sense of creating mental anguish in order to make other people happy and to obtain celebrity and fame.

The episode [...] "Fishsticks", which prominently featured rapper Kanye West, includes a two-and-a-half minute song, [...] "Gay Fish", that parodies West's [...] "Heartless". [...] "Gay Fish" [...] satirizes the rapper's tendency {{to rely on}} audio processing to correct his mistakes in pitch. After [...] "Fishsticks" [...] aired, the full song was made available for download on South Park Studios. Several fake Jonas Brothers songs, with lyrics about the band members' physical attractiveness, were written for [...] "The Ring". Some songs also emphasize the band's belief in sexual abstinence, with lyrics like, [...] "Who needs sex and drugs and partying when we <b>can</b> <b>cook</b> a meal and sit around and watch Netflix?" [...] The strongly erotic reactions of the young girls at their concert parody the frenzied female fan reactions the Jonas Brothers tend to elicit, even though their image projects wholesomeness and chastity. In the episode [...] "Whale Wars", Cartman plays the video game Rock Band and performs a rendition, praised by critics, of the Lady Gaga song [...] "Poker Face".

2500|$|A {{solar cooker}} is a device which uses {{the energy of}} direct {{sunlight}} to heat, cook or [...] pasteurise drink. Many solar cookers currently in use are relatively inexpensive, low-tech devices, although some are as powerful or as expensive as traditional stoves, and advanced, large-scale solar cookers <b>can</b> <b>cook</b> for hundreds of people. Because they use no fuel and cost nothing to operate, many nonprofit organizations are promoting their use worldwide {{in order to help}} reduce fuel costs (especially where monetary reciprocity is low) and air pollution, and to slow down the deforestation and desertification caused by gathering firewood for cooking.|$|E
2500|$|Outdoor {{areas in}} which food is {{prepared}} are generally {{not considered to be}} kitchens, even though an outdoor area set up for regular food preparation, for instance when camping, might be called an [...] "outdoor kitchen".

2500|$|While {{school feeding}} {{programs}} {{have a variety}} of positive impacts, there are some possible negative impacts these programs can cause. For example, school feeding programs can increase the cost of schooling by requiring that communities provide fire-wood for cooking as well as other items such as fresh-fruit, vegetables, and condiments. Additionally, communities are also expected to provide people who <b>can</b> <b>cook</b> these meals and maintain stores of all of the required food products, as well as kitchens and other fundamentals of meal provision. By causing a variety of needs and requirements to increase in a given community, the net benefit to a community from school feeding programs may be reduced.|$|E
