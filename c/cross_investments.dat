40|$|The {{problem of}} underinvestment in {{specific}} assets {{is a key}} issue in new institutional economics, especially in case of cooperative relation specific investments. It can be solved due to vertical restraints, as an alternative way of vertical integration to transfer control to partner, who makes relation specific investments. The type of relationspecific investments called «cooperative» investments (or <b>cross</b> <b>investments)</b> was nearly absent in economic analysis up {{to the very end}} of the twentieth century despite of the fact that such investments are widespread. It led to the absence of analysis relation specific investments in official regulation documents. At the same time, different types of relation specific investments can be characterized by different degree of riskiness and need special regulations of vertical agreements. In the paper author makes an attempt to analyze the European methodology of assessment vertical restraints under rule of reason focusing on the type of relation specific investments. It makes possible to improve analysis of vertical restraint in Russian antitrust...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop and}} empirically test {{a model of}} foreign R&D {{investments}} {{that takes into account}} strategic interaction in R&D location decisions by multinational firms in the context of R&D spillovers and foreign technology sourcing strategies. In a two-country, two-firm model with <b>cross</b> <b>investments,</b> the optimal share of R&D performed abroad depends on the efficiency of intra-firm international technology transfer, the degree of inter-firm R&D spillovers, the intensity of product market competition, and the importance of the general knowledge pool. The impact of these factors differs markedly between technology leading firms and technology laggards. We find support for most of the predictions of the model in an empirical analysis of patents based on innovations in foreign countries by 131 leading European manufacturing firms in 22 ISIC industries in 1996 - 1997. For technology leaders, the share of patents originating in other EU countries responds positively to host country product market competition and is strongly increasing in the level of intellectual property rights protection. Foreign R&D by technology laggards is discouraged by host country competition but increases with the efficiency of (reverse) technology transfer. Foreign R&D of both leaders and laggards increases with the size of the local knowledge pool and the size of production operations in the host country.

40|$|A {{large part}} of border <b>crossing</b> <b>investment</b> {{takes the form of}} {{international}} mergers and acquisitions. In this article, we ask how optimal repatriation tax systems look like in a world where investment involves a change of ownership, instead of a reallocation of real capital. We find that the standard results of international taxation do not carry over to the case of international mergers and acquisitions. The deduction system is no longer optimal from a national perspective and the foreign tax credit system fails to ensure global optimality. The tax exemption system is optimal if ownership advantage is a public good within the multinational firm. However, the cross-border cash-flow tax system dominates the exemption system in terms of optimality properties.

The Inter-American {{relations have}} reached a new phase characterized by the growth of commercial relationships, by <b>crossed</b> <b>investments</b> and interchange of diverse kind. The Miami Metropolitan Area, strategically located at the Southern tip of the United States, close to the Straits of Florida, has become {{during the last two}} decades the main gateway for this flux of exchange to and from the Caribbean and Latin America. Taking advantage of its "hub and spokes" function through its port and its airport, it has become a large sprawling metropolis, a center of attraction for international tourism and it now vies for some kind of political status. The Miami Summit (1994) has been the platform from where the project of a Free Trade Area, encompassing the whole hemisphere (FTAA), was launched. While this idea makes some progress, Miami believes that it will benefit from this dynamic, based on the accomplishment of a large marketplace.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article is a {{discussion}} of Stephen Hymer's works ьееп as a significant centribution {{to the development of}} the theory of multinational corporation. Since he submitted his doctoral thesis at the MIT in I 960 he has been quoted in almost all publications devoted to the theory of multinational corporations and many of his hypotheses have been verified and confirmed by both his supporters and opponents. The article describes Hymer's most important hypotheses concerning internationalization of the national enterprise, the causes and effects of mutually <b>crossed</b> <b>investments</b> between the USA and Europe, the impact of the firm's size and position in the home market structure on the choice of forms of foreign expansion and many others. The article also presents the radicalization of Hymer's views, from the time of presentation of his doctoral thesis to his last paper, published in 1972. Hymer from the very beginning of his career was under the influence of Marxist ideas, which determined his methods of research and interpretation of facts connected with the activity of multinational corporations. After some time and new research, Hymer ceases to be only an interpreter of the capitalist market phenomena and ardently accuses the system which demands unequal economic and social development. One of the examples of degenerat ion of this system is the existence of monopolies, their various forms and the process of internationalization of enterprises with all its consequences for world economy.

This perspective is used to show that the imposition of a Tobin tax would cause extensive material damage to the system, with consequences that may run counter to the expectations of supporters of the tax...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries into the world economy is increasingly multifaceted. Although oil and gas revenues are still of paramount importance, the GCC countries have developed a diversified economic structure with new sectors emerging {{in the fields of}} petrochemicals, heavy industries and services.

The US only accounts for 10 percent of imports nowadays while the European Union and Asia each roughly contribute one third of overall imports.

40|$|Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is {{generally}} {{viewed as an}} important national instrument to attract stable foreign capital and to enable knowledge and technology transfer. Most countries adopt a policy mix to restrict and encourage FDI in accordance to their national interest and strategy. However, more and more countries are getting open toward foreign investment in the domestic environment. The attractiveness of a FDI location is enhanced by the pull and push forces in both the host and home countries. It is therefore critical for the policy makers to identify a set of pull and push factors that might improve competitiveness of a country as a location of foreign investment. Recognising these forces, host countries may adopt various FDI related policies to retain existing and entice potential foreign direct investors.
