5000|$|There is no German {{word for}} jaywalking. In general, {{pedestrians}} {{are allowed to}} <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> everywhere. <b>The</b> {{first and most important}} paragraph of the StVO §1 is not to endanger anybody. Car drivers must always be prepared to brake for pedestrians, especially for children and elderly people. That is the first thing you learn in the driving education. On the other hand, German pedestrians, according to the German Road Traffic Act (Straßenverkehrsordnung) [...] (VwV), have to watch the vehicular traffic carefully and cross a street quickly and on the shortest way across the driving lanes. If the situation on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> requires, pedestrians are only allowed to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> at intersections or within the markings of traffic signals or crosswalks. Pedestrians who <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> at intersections or crossings have to use existing traffic signals or crosswalks. If one wants to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> outside <b>the</b> markings of traffic lights or crosswalks, one must carefully convince one's self before and during <b>the</b> <b>crossing</b> that <b>the</b> road is clear and wait before crossing if a vehicle approaches. A pedestrian must not interrupt the flowing traffic. [...] Although 15 meters is not considered [...] "at" [...] the crosswalk or traffic light (KG Berlin VR 78 450), pedestrians must not <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> 30 meter (BGH VRS 26 327) near a crosswalk and 40 meter (BGH NJW 00 3069: 39-43m; KG Berlin VRS 89 98: 33,5m) near to a traffic light but they don't need to go 200m to a crossroad or 100m to a traffic signal (OLG Hamburg VRS 87 249). In heavy traffic, pedestrians must not <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> as they might have to stop on a traffic lane (OLG Hamm, Az. 27 U 115/96). Typical fines for jaywalking (i.e. not using existing crosswalks or traffic lights) in Germany are between 5€ and 10€. https://www.bussgeldkatalog.org/fussgaenger/ ...|$|R

2500|$|Another of Caird's lifelong preoccupations was Paul the Apostle, seen {{particularly}} in his works Principalities and Powers, Paul's Letters from Prison, and comments scattered throughout The Language and Imagery of the Bible and New Testament Theology. For Caird Paul {{has not been}} given his proper due by modern scholarly opinion {{in terms of the}} uniqueness and importance of his contribution to Christianity. As a dyed-in-the-wool Cambridge-trained classicist, Caird saw Paul {{not so much as a}} conveyor of supernatural information but as a brilliantly innovative thinker, a skillful interpreter of the scriptures and of the mind of Jesus, or [...] "humanity at its very best". Paul was also a revolutionary, as Caird saw him: one who was fervently committed to the socially convulsive implications of the gospel, especially in such concerns as class divisions within society (including the equality of women), the constant corruption of political and religious authority, and the unity of the Christian church as a rebuke to a warring and fractured world. In all his works Caird never shrank from making clear his unqualified admiration for what he saw as the frequently misunderstood apostle; yet this could hardly be mistaken for hero worship. He could disagree with Paul at times, and [...] "if he had ever seen [...] approaching in the High Street, he wouldn't have treated him with exaggerated deference, nor would he have <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> to avoid him. He would probably have invited him to read a paper to his Postgraduate Seminar, and would have felt no embarrassment at taking him into the Senior Common Room for tea beforehand". In certain ways Caird contributed to the debate concerning the New Perspective on Paul, seen perhaps most visibly in an extended review of E. P. Sanders's work Paul and Palestinian Judaism.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 3 February, the PAVN {{commander}} seeing the buildup of Marines at Huế University thinned out his frontline forces leaving just a platoon to defend the Treasury Building and adjacent post office. On the morning of 4 February the Marines launched their attack on the Treasury complex, the initial assault was on the left flank by Company A, 1/1 Marines which was tasked with securing a Catholic chapel and the Jeanne d'Arc High School (...) [...] The Marines secured the chapel and the east school building, but were pinned down for hours by interlocking fire from the west building. During this action Sergeant Alfredo Cantu Gonzalez would be killed while firing on PAVN machine gun positions, he was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the battle. The Marines eventually broke into the west building and cleared it room by room. Due to the delays on the left flank, the main assault in the centre by Company F, 2/5 Marines was delayed until mid-afternoon. The Treasury compound was hit by M-48 and 106mm fire and tear gas, while a Mule-mounted 106mm engaged the machine gun in the Le Loi Elementary School. Under cover of the tear gas and the 106mm backblast the Marines <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and blew holes in the wall using C4 and Bazookas. The Marines then pushed into the Treasury building which the PAVN had hastily abandoned. The post office also seemed abandoned until the Marines located a vault inside the building, they proceeded to gas out the PAVN inside killing more than 24 of them as they emerged. After securing the Jeanne d'Arc High School, Company A, 1/1 Marines recaptured the Le Loi Elementary School, {{more than half the}} Company's 147 men had been wounded or killed in that day's fighting. That evening VC sappers succeeded in blowing up the An Cuu bridge, cutting the road link to Phu Bai.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the pedestrian {{perception of risk}} and behaviour in signalized street crossings with a flashing green beacon, while, simultaneously, the cars turn right or left with a flashing orange beacon. The pedestrians have right of way in situations like that. However, {{it is not always}} implemented by the drivers. As a result, the risk of <b>the</b> pedestrian <b>crossing</b> is raised, as they are forced to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> even in <b>the</b> red signalized phase. This study took place in the Greek city of Volos in December 2008. 2024 pedestrians were examined {{with the use of a}} video camera in two signalized intersections in the center of the city. During the elaboration of the data, the pedestrians were separated by sex, age and, while <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> whether they were alone or in a group. The study presents the pedestrian behaviour and perception of risk as they wait to <b>cross</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> either on <b>the</b> sidewalk or in <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and <b>the</b> choice of <b>crossing</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> either with a green or red light.
