25|$|Reverse money {{laundering}} {{is a process}} that disguises a legitimate source of funds that are to be used for illegal purposes. It is usually perpetrated for the purpose of financing terrorism but can be also used by criminal organizations that have invested in legal businesses and would like to withdraw legitimate funds from official circulation. Unaccounted <b>cash</b> <b>received</b> via disguising financial transactions is not included in official financial reporting and could be used to evade taxes, hand in bribes and pay “under-the-table” salaries. For example, in an affidavit filed 24 March 2014 in United States District Court, Northern California, San Francisco Division, FBI special agent Emmanuel V. Pascau alleged that several people associated with the Chee Kung Tong organization, and California State Senator Leland Yee, engaged in reverse {{money laundering}} activities.|$|E

2500|$|Cash-intensive {{business}}es: In this method, {{a business}} typically expected {{to receive a}} large proportion of its revenue as cash uses its accounts to deposit criminally derived cash. Such enterprises often operate openly and in doing so generate cash revenue from incidental legitimate business in addition to the illicit cash – in such cases the business will usually claim all <b>cash</b> <b>received</b> as legitimate earnings. Service businesses are best suited to this method, as such enterprises have little or no [...] variable costs and/or a large ratio between revenue and variable costs, which makes it difficult to detect discrepancies between revenues and costs.

One difference between the estimates concerns the method of calculation. One method calculates losses as the total amount that victims thought they were owed, but will never receive. The smaller estimates use a different method, subtracting the total <b>cash</b> <b>received</b> from the scheme from the total cash paid into the scheme, after excluding from the calculation persons accused of collaborating with the scheme, persons who invested through [...] "feeder funds," [...] and anyone who received more cash from the scheme than they paid in.
