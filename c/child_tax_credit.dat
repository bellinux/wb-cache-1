5|$|Brown's 2000 Spending Review {{outlined}} a major expansion of government spending, particularly {{on health and}} education. In his April 2002 budget, Brown increased National Insurance {{to pay for health}} spending. He also introduced working tax credits, and in his last budget as Chancellor, Brown gave an extra £3billion in pension allowances, an increase in the <b>child</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit,</b> and an increase in the working tax credit. These increases were followed by another £1billion of support for increases in the <b>child</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit.</b>|$|E

50|$|In April 2015, David Cameron {{denied any}} such {{plans to cut}} <b>child</b> {{benefits}} or <b>tax</b> <b>credits.</b> However, three months later, George Osborne, the then Finance Minister, announced that <b>child</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> {{would be limited to}} the first two children only.

25|$|In the United Kingdom, the <b>Child</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>Credit</b> and Working Tax Credit {{are paid}} {{directly}} into the claimant's bank account or Post Office Card Account. In exceptional circumstances, these can be paid by cashcheque (sometimes called giro) however payments may stop if account details are not provided. A minimum level of Child Tax Credits is payable to all individuals or couples with children, {{up to a certain}} income limit. The actual amount of Child Tax Credits that a person may receive depends on these factors: the level of their income, the number of children they have, whether the children are receiving Disability Living Allowance and the education status of any children over 16.|$|E
25|$|A Roth 401(k) plan is {{probably}} most advantageous {{to those who}} might otherwise choose a Roth IRA, such as younger workers who are currently taxed in a lower tax bracket but expect to be taxed in a higher bracket upon reaching retirement age. Higher-income workers may prefer a traditional 401(k) plan because they are currently taxed in a higher tax bracket but would expect to be taxed at a lower rate in retirement; also, those near the Roth IRA income limits may prefer a traditional 401(k) since its pre-tax contributions lowers Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and thus increases eligibility for various other tax incentives (Roth IRA contributions, the <b>Child</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>Credit,</b> medical expense deduction, etc.). Another consideration for those currently in higher tax brackets {{is the future of}} income tax rates in the US: if income tax rates increase, current taxation would be desirable for a wider group). The Roth 401(k) offers the advantage of tax free distribution but is not constrained by the same income limitations. For example, in tax year 2013, normal Roth IRA contributions are limited to $5,500 ($6,500 if age 50 or older); up to $17,500 could be contributed to a Roth 401(k) account if no other elective deferrals were taken for the tax year, such as traditional 401(k) deferrals.|$|E
500|$|According to Congressional Quarterly's Politics in America, one of Neal's long-standing {{legislative}} priorities is {{to simplify}} the tax code. Neal has long advocated repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), believing its effects have reached unreasonably low income brackets. He led an unsuccessful movement to reform the AMT in 2007. He successfully pushed in 1998 to exempt a <b>child</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> from being affected by the AMT, and in 2001 Congress made the exemption permanent at his urging. He voted against the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, saying that they would force millions onto the AMT. Another priority of Neal's is to eliminate tax [...] "loopholes" [...] that favor higher-income individuals. He was the lead proponent of a bill to require federal contractors to pay federal taxes for workers hired through offshore shell headquarters. The bill, H.R. 6081, passed both houses of Congress unanimously and {{was signed into law}} in May 2008.|$|E

2500|$|A {{refundable}} {{tax credit}} is a mechanism whereby {{the tax system}} can reduce the tax owed by a household to below zero, and result in a net payment to the taxpayer beyond their own payments into the tax system. Examples of refundable tax credits include {{the earned income tax}} credit and the additional <b>child</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> in the US, and working tax credits and child tax credits in the UK. Such a system is slightly different from a negative income tax, in that the refundable tax credit is usually only paid to households that have earned at least some income. [...] This policy is more targeted against poverty than the minimum wage, because it avoids subsidizing low-income workers who are supported by high-income households (for example, teenagers still living with their parents).|$|E

2500|$|Between 2001 and 2003, the Bush {{administration}} {{instituted a}} federal {{tax cut for}} all taxpayers. Among other changes, the lowest income tax rate was lowered from 15% to 10%, the 27% rate went to 25%, the 30% rate went to 28%, the 35% rate went to 33%, and the top marginal tax rate went from 39.6% to 35%. In addition, the <b>child</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> went from $500 to $1000, and the [...] "marriage penalty" [...] was reduced. Since the cuts were implemented {{as part of the}} annual congressional budget resolution, which protected the bill from filibusters, numerous amendments, and more than 20 hours of debate, it had to include a sunset clause. Unless congress passed legislation making the tax cuts permanent, they were set to expire after the 2010 tax year.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1991, Greene {{called for}} {{existing}} tax and social benefits to be rolled {{into a single}} national child support program targeted to benefit low-income Canadians. [...] Greene argued that existing benefits favoured wealthier families over the poor, and that the balance needed to be changed. [...] Critics {{expressed concern that the}} proposed changes would threaten the universality of these programs, and reduce benefits for vulnerable middle-income families. [...] The Mulroney government implemented the <b>child</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> program but did not implement the recommendations in the report for a national day care program which it had initially supported. [...] Greene tried to convince her government to re-establish the program later in the year, without success. [...] Greene also sought to create a national standard for social assistance to eliminate the wide disparities between the provinces.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, Rubio and Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, {{proposed}} a tax plan which, according to The Wall Street Journal, combined thinking from [...] "old-fashioned, Reagan-era supply siders" [...] and a [...] "breed of largely younger conservative reform thinkers" [...] {{who are concerned}} with the tax burden on the middle-class. [...] The plan would lower the top corporate income tax rate from 38% to 25%, eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends and inherited estates, and create a new <b>child</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> worth up to $2,500 per child.

2500|$|During {{his first}} term (2001–2004), President Bush sought and {{obtained}} Congressional approval for the Bush tax cuts, which mainly comprised the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA). These acts decreased many income tax rates, reduced the capital gains tax, increased the <b>child</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> and eliminated the so-called [...] "marriage penalty", and were set to expire in 2010, while increasing federal deficits by an estimated 1.5% to 2.0% GDP each year. Among the many stated rationales for the large income tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 was the 2001 recession, which followed the bursting of the Dot-com bubble in late 2000 and early 2001. Further, some influential conservatives such as Alan Greenspan believed that the nearly $5 trillion in budget surpluses forecast by the CBO for the 2002-2011 period should be given back to taxpayers rather than used to pay down the national debt.|$|E
2500|$|Among other provisions, the act {{accelerated}} certain tax changes {{passed in}} the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, increased the exemption amount for the individual Alternative Minimum Tax, and lowered taxes of income from dividends and capital gains. JGTRRA continued on the precedent established by the 2001 EGTRRA, while increasing tax reductions on investment income from dividends and capital gains. JGTRRA accelerated the gradual rate reduction and increase in credits passed in EGTRRA. The maximum tax rate decreases originally scheduled to be phased into effect in 2006 under EGTRRA were retroactively enacted {{to apply to the}} 2003 tax year. Also, the <b>child</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> was increased to what would have been the 2010 level, and [...] "marriage penalty" [...] relief was accelerated to 2009 levels. In addition, the threshold at which the alternative minimum tax applies was also increased. JGTRRA increased both the percentage rate at which items can be depreciated and the amount a taxpayer may choose to expense under Section 179, allowing them to deduct the full cost of the item from their income without having to depreciate the amount.|$|E
