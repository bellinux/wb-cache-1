40|$|Asthma bronchiale {{represents}} serious {{social and}} economic problems in all over the world. Financial expenses are elevated every year. The aim of the presented study was to analyze the current therapeutic approach {{in the management of}} bronchial asthma and to evaluate pharmacoeconomic aspects of treatment in selected outdoor asth-matic patients in region of Koice (Eastern Slovakia). Patients: The data of the total number 297 patients (183 females 61. 6 %, 114 males 38. 4 %), aged from 18 to 78 (average age 38) were analyzed. Results: The total expenses per day for all asthmatics represented 19 465 Sk (65. 54 Sk/day/patient). Short-acting ß 2 -agonists (ß-A) (55. 2 %) were administered most frequently, followed by inhaled cor-ticosteroids (CS) (43. 1 %), theophyllins (T) with slow released formulas (36. 4 %), <b>cromoglycates</b> (C) (33 %), long-acting ß-A (19. 9 %), combined preparations ß-A with anticholinergics (ATCH) (Berodual, Combivent) (12. 12 %), depot CS (10. 44 %), antileucotriens (ALT) (10. 10 %), combined preparation ß-A with C (Ditec, 8. 75 %), short-acting T (6. 73 %), systemic CS (5. 72 %), ATCH (4. 71 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{determine}} {{the patterns of}} preventive to reactive prescribing for asthma among general practices in the City and East London Family Health Services Authority area and their relation to prescribing cost. DESIGN [...] Descriptive study of asthma prescribing during April 1992 to March 1993. Prescribing data were linked with general practice and population data on one database. SETTING [...] City and East London Family Health Services Authority area, including all general practices in contract with the authority, which covers the inner city London Boroughs of Hackney, Tower Hamlets, and Newham and the Corporation of the City of London. SUBJECTS [...] All 163 general practices as at 1 June 1993. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Ratios of prescribed inhaled corticosteroids plus <b>cromoglycates</b> (prophylactic treatment) to bronchodilators; distribution {{of the cost of}} asthma prescribing; distribution of overall generic prescribing; proportion of asthma generic prescribing; distribution of cost of overall drugs prescribed per prescribing unit. RESULTS [...] Practices approved for band 3 health promotion or asthma surveillance and those with a general practitioner trainer had on average higher ratios of prophylactic to bronchodilator treatment and significantly higher asthma drug costs than other practices. Those practices with high levels of overall generic prescribing had significantly higher prophylactic to bronchodilator ratios than those with lower levels of generic prescribing. Practices with higher levels of asthma drug generic prescribing also had significantly higher prophylactic prescribing. However, the proportion of generically prescribed asthma drugs was lower than overall generic prescribing. There was no correlation between the ratio of prophylactic to bronchodilator asthma prescribing and the proportion of overall drugs expenditure, but high spending practices spent significantly more on asthma drugs. CONCLUSIONS [...] Pressure to reduce the cost of asthma prescribing may lead to a lowering of the ratio of prophylactic to bronchodilator treatments. However, reducing prophylactic prescribing would run contrary to the British Thoracic Society guidelines and might worsen the quality of asthma care...|$|R

50|$|Starting with khella, a {{traditional}} remedy for asthma, Altounyan discovered in 1965 that khella's active ingredient was khellin. He eventually produced a safer chemical based on khellin, sodium <b>cromoglycate.</b> This was later marketed as Intal by Fisons Pharmaceuticals, which {{was taken over}} by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, who in turn were acquired into Aventis and sanofi-aventis. Prior to the RPR takeover, the R&D element of Fisons was sold to Astra, making it now part of AstraZeneca. Sodium <b>cromoglycate</b> was the first clinically utilised mast cell stabiliser. The mast cell {{plays a key role in}} allergic and asthmatic inflammation. Mast cells contain powerful inflammatory mediators which when released lead to inflammation and bronchoconstriction of the airway. Sodium <b>cromoglycate</b> stabilises the mast cell thereby preventing the release of the mediators.|$|E
40|$|Asthma affects {{nearly two}} and a half million people in Canada. In Saskatchewan, the {{prevalence}} of asthma has increased across all age groups since 1981. Current literature indicates that the purchase of all asthma medications increased in the last 20 years both province and nationwide. Since the early 1990 s, the Canadian Consensus Guidelines (CCG) for the treatment of asthma recommended increasing the use of inhaled corticosteroids as a mainstay for controlling asthma symptoms. The CCG have also encouraged decreasing the use of short-acting, inhaled beta 2 -agonist medication. The objective of this descriptive epidemiological study was to investigate asthma medication prescribing at the individual level among physician-diagnosed asthma patients, aged 0 to 64 years, in Saskatchewan from January 1, 1991 to December 31, 2000. Saskatchewan residents covered under the provincial health insurance plan who received a physician’s diagnosis of asthma, identified each calendar year, were included in the study (296, 430 asthma patients in total). Nearly 80. 0 % of this asthma population purchased at least one asthma medication in each calendar year. From 1991 to 2000, users and the mean number of prescriptions of short-acting beta 2 -agonists decreased slightly. The proportion of users and mean number prescriptions per year of inhaled corticosteroids increased. The highest mean numbers of prescriptions and users of inhaled corticosteroids were among the 0 - 4 year olds. Short-acting beta 2 -agonists, inhaled corticosteroids, and oral corticosteroids were the most popular medications. Users of theophyllines and <b>cromoglycates</b> decreased. The 15 - 34 year old males showed the greatest "inappropriate" use as high users of short-acting beta 2 -agonists and low users of inhaled corticosteroids. There was increasing compliance with the CCG over the ten years. The combination of beta 2 -agonists with inhaled corticosteroids usurped beta 2 -agonist monotherapy as the most popular form of asthma therapy by the year 2000. Users of combination therapy increased from 19 % to 38. 7 %, while users of beta 2 -agonists alone decreased from 34. 5 % to 23. 1 %. From 1996 to 2000, the monthly number of both short-acting beta 2 -agonists and inhaled corticosteroids prescriptions decreased for all users in July and August. Peak increases in the number of short-acting beta 2 -agonist prescriptions, for children under 15, occurred in September. For adults, peak increases occurred in December for both medications. These study results will enhance the understanding of asthma medication use among children and adults and will help healthcare professionals develop new treatment programs for the management of asthma...|$|R

Patients exercised on a treadmill for six to eight minutes at submaximal work loads on five days, 30 minutes after inhaling placebo or sodium <b>cromoglycate.</b> The FEV 1 was recorded before treatment, before exercise, and up to 30 minutes after exercise.

At the end of the treatment period, patients inhaled a 20 mg spincap of sodium <b>cromoglycate</b> and the technique of inhalation was graded.

40|$|A {{prospective}} study was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of (sodium) <b>cromoglycate</b> {{in the treatment of}} persistent wheezing in 31 children between 4 and 12 months of age. The subjects were randomised to receive either 40 mg of <b>cromoglycate</b> (n = 16) or physiological saline as placebo (n = 15) three times a day by wet nebulisation in a double blind fashion for a period of six weeks. The patients were evaluated with daily symptom scores and respiratory function testing measuring maximal expiratory flow at functional residual capacity (VmaxFRC) before initiating treatment and upon completion. At baseline, mean (SD) symptom scores between the two groups were comparable (<b>cromoglycate</b> 99. 5 (29. 8), placebo 104. 5 (29. 7)) as were VmaxFRC expressed as per cent of predicted normals (<b>cromoglycate</b> 48 (28), placebo 46 (20)). Upon completion of the treatment protocol, no significant difference could be found between the two groups for either symptom score (<b>cromoglycate</b> 67. 6 (40. 2), placebo 58. 6 (41. 4)), or VmaxFRC (<b>cromoglycate</b> 52 (24), placebo 60 (32)).
