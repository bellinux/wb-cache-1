50|$|The {{acorn nut}} {{is a type}} of {{fastener}} which gets its name from its shape. Acorn nut is its common name and it is also called a crown hex nut, blind nut, <b>cap</b> <b>nut</b> or domed <b>cap</b> <b>nut.</b> It is a nut that has a domed top to cover the threads. This is to prevent contact with the external thread to protect the threads or protect other things the threads would rub against. In addition the dome gives a more finished appearance. It is usually made of brass, steel, stainless steel (low carbon content) or nylon. It can also be chrome plated and given a mirror finish.|$|E
50|$|There are {{standards}} {{governing the}} manufacture of acorn nuts. One is Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Standard J483, High and Low Crown (Blind, Acorn) Hex Nuts. Another is Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN) 1587, Hexagon Domed <b>Cap</b> <b>Nuts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Quercus hinckleyi is a shrub {{that forms}} a dense, tangled thicket {{no more than}} 1.5 meters (5 feet) tall. The highly {{branched}} stems are coated in scaly gray bark and the smaller twigs are brown and sometimes waxy. The leaves are up to 1.5 centimeters (0.6 inch) long by 1.5 cm (0.6 inch) wide and have large, widely spaced teeth, resembling holly leaves. The blades are leathery, waxy, and blue-green in color. The fruit is an acorn 1 to 1.5 centimeters (0.4-0.6 inch) wide at the <b>cap,</b> the <b>nut</b> measuring up to 2 centimeters (0.8 inch) long.|$|R

The independent rear suspension and luxury front and rear Sensatrac variable rate dampers fitted made for smooth ride control and high speed stability. Additionally, HSV added complementary special features which were for the driver rather than the car, such as a Maglite torch, wheel <b>nut</b> <b>cap</b> remover and a multi-purpose pen knife. The VT Series II introduced a new 5.7-litre LS1 V8 which produced [...] and 473 Nm.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} {{supported}} by two fieldstone abutments and a pier. Its two spans are identical in construction, with one being much longer than the other. The 45 ft span {{at the south end}} is an end-post three-panel pony truss with both cast and wrought iron elements. Its upper chord is a riveted steel girder supported by lattice-braced members riveted to the flanges of the plate girder. The lower chord consists of two double wrought iron tension bars. The central panel is cross-braced with wrought-iron tie rods. All joints, not just in this span but the main one as well, are secured by threaded iron pins two inches (5 cm) wide <b>capped</b> with hexagonal <b>nuts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Also {{important}} is knowing {{the condition of}} the spare tire, jack and lug wrench upon purchase of a used car. This, among other things, is one very important item many used car buyers overlook when inspecting a potential purchase. If the vehicle is missing any of the items that go with a spare tire, it's possible to purchase them again from the manufacturer's dealership. It's also possible to buy the tools used, or from a junkyard, though if one chooses this route it is of utmost importance that {{the condition of the}} items be inspected thoroughly before storing them in your car. It's also possible to purchase a jack and a universal lug nut wrench (usually shaped like a + sign) from an auto parts store or the automotive section of a department store, though these items will likely not fit in the vehicles designated spare tire tool storage location and will likely require that the items remain loose in the cargo area. It is worth bearing in mind that, in an attempt to decrease theft, numerous cars on the road today (especially those with alloy wheels) may use one or more security <b>caps</b> or <b>nuts</b> on a wheel. These can only be removed with a specific tool which should be present in the car's tool kit. Without this tool {{it will be difficult to}} remove a wheel.|$|R
40|$|Shear {{connectors}} {{are widely}} used in composite bridges that provide composite action. Their damage will reduce the load-carrying capacity of the structure. In this study, a novel method based on Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) was developed to assess {{the integrity of the}} shear connectors. A bridge model was constructed in the laboratory and some removable anchors were specially designed and fabricated to link the beams and slab that were cast separately. Each anchor consists of a threaded bar that penetrates through the soffit of the beam and ties up into an embedded <b>nut</b> <b>cap</b> to simulate a shear connector in the real bridges. Different damage scenarios were introduced by pulling out some connectors. Vibration tests were carried out in each damage scenario. Various damage detection methods have been applied and results show that the method was able to detect all the assumed damage scenarios successfully and consistently.

40|$|Shear {{connectors}} are {{of primary}} importance in slab–girder bridges to provide composite action. Their damage {{will reduce the}} load-carrying capacity of the structure. To test the suitability and efficiency of various vibration-based damage identification methods to assess {{the integrity of the}} shear connectors, a 1 : 3 scaled bridge model was constructed in the laboratory. Some removable anchors were specially designed and fabricated to link the beams and slab that were cast separately. Each anchor consists of a threaded bar that penetrates through the soffit of the beam and ties up into an embedded <b>nut</b> <b>cap</b> to simulate a shear connector in real bridges. Different damage scenarios were introduced by pulling out some connectors. Vibration tests were carried out in each damage scenario. Various damage detection methods have been applied and results show that a local approach was able to detect all the damage successfully and consistently. This new method does not need any reference data for the structure, and therefore it is suitable for application to the prototype bridges. The proposed local method was also compared with some global methods, including optimal model updating techniques. The sensitivity region of this local vibration method for damage detection is also investigated. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|An econobox is a United States pejorative slang {{term for}} any {{of a series of}} small, boxy, {{fuel-efficient}} economy cars with few luxuries and a low sticker price. Econobox mostly denotes a stripped out, poverty specification, built down to a price, entry level version of a conventional car of the era, such as the 1950s Studebaker Scotsman or 1970s/80s Chevrolet Chevette. The other school of economy car design is to re-invent the car in order cope better with the stringent design constraints of low cost while retaining functionality. The British Austin Mini which did not sell well in America is the archetypal car of this school, and was bought by many British and other Europeans who could afford much more expensive cars, because it was at launch in 1959 technologically advanced with transverse engine front wheel drive and all independent suspension, and was stylish, fashionable and fun to drive as well as economical.The typical modern econobox is a subcompact car, usually with a three-door hatchback format with transverse engine mounting and front-wheel drive, to maximize interior space despite overall small dimensions. They are usually outfitted with vinyl bucket seats, basic AM radio, a rudimentary heater, foam-cushioned plastic trim, two-speed wipers and painted steel rims with a chromed wheel <b>nut</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|R
40|$|Shear {{connectors}} {{are widely}} used to link the slab and girders together in slab-on-girder structures. Assessment of the integrity of shear connectors {{is an important issue}} in the maintenance and health monitoring of such structures. In this study, a 1 : 3 scaled bridge model was constructed with removable anchors linking the slab and girders as shear connectors. Each anchor consisted of a threaded bar penetrating through the soffit of a girder and anchored in the slab by an embedded <b>nut</b> <b>cap</b> with welded steel bar. Different damage scenarios were simulated by removing some of these connectors. A signal-based damage detection method in which the damage feature is characterized by the wavelet packet energy changes was applied to the damage identification of the shear connectors. Using measurements of hammer impact responses, the locations of the loosening of the shear connectors were effectively detected. This paper demonstrates that the wavelet packet-based energy index is a sensitive local damage indicator. The results also show that comparison of the relative vibration between the slab and the girders is a more effective technique for evaluating the shear connector damage than comparison of the vibration of the slab before and after shear connector damage. This finding is particularly interesting because data from the intact (undamaged) bridge is not required. The suitability and efficiency of the approach is expected to be applied in situ to assess the integrity of shear connectors in existing structures.

40|$|The need {{to reduce}} weight while {{maintaining}} good mechanical properties in materials used in the automotive industry has over the years seen an increased exploitation of various steels to meet this new demand. In line with this development, the ferritic stainless steel family has seen a wide application in this industry, with the AISI 436 type increasingly being used for automotive trims and mufflers for exhaust systems, {{as well as a}} significant part of this steel’s application being for the manufacture of wheel nuts and wheel <b>nut</b> <b>caps</b> in trucks, mainly through the deep drawing process. However, there have been reports of some poor surface roughening of this material during deep drawing, with tearing and/or cracking also reported in some instances. This has been suspected to possibly be associated with some local differences in localized mechanical properties between grains and grain clusters of the rolled and annealed material. In order to investigate the poor surface roughness exhibited by AISI 436 ferritic stainless steel (FSS) during deep-drawing, Lankford values (Rmean and Δr), grain size, and microtextures of various sheet samples from this steel were studied. The chemical composition range for the samples was 0. 013 – 0. 017 % C, 17 – 17. 4 % Cr, 0. 9 – 1 % Mo, and 0. 4 – 0. 5 % Nb. The steels were subjected to various hot and cold rolling processing routes i. e. involving industrial direct rolling (DR) or intermediate annealing rolling (IR), and the drawability and final surface qualities of the steels were compared. It was found that the DR route gave an average R-mean and Δr value of 1. 9 and - 1. 4 respectively, while the IR route yielded an average Rmean and Δr value of 1. 6 and 0. 52 respectively. The high Δr value for the DR processing route had a substantial adverse effect on the drawability. IR samples exhibited a smoother surface finish on visual inspection, while clear flow lines were visible on the DR samples, despite the fact that DR is the preferred industrial processing route due to the reduced production costs it offers. This observation was also confirmed through SEM examinations. The difference in the surface quality was attributed to microtexture. However, the mechanism responsible for this difference still needs to be identified.
