Safe {{operation is}} dependent on how technology is used, so {{it is important to}} take human factors issues into consideration. During design or modification of the control room system, its ability to support safe operation must be assessed to ensure that safety-critical discrepancies are eliminated before implementation. Methods are a necessary tool in human factors evaluation, and there are many to choose from. One prerequisite for evaluation is knowing what to evaluate, and this knowledge determines which methods are most suitable. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> that can guide the choice of evaluation methods for assessing nuclear power plant control room systems. Measures targeted by human factors evaluation methods were compared with aspects that contribute to safe operation and measures proposed and used by other researchers. The conclusion of this paper is that measures targeted by human factors evaluation methods can be grouped into six categories: system performance, task performance, teamwork, use of resources, user experience, and identification of design discrepancies. These six categories can guide the choice of human factors evaluation methods to assess socio-technical systems.

40|$|Aims/hypothesis. Currently, three <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> {{are used}} to assess {{cardiovascular}} autonomic dysfunction: measures of the Ewing-test, measures of heart-rate variability, and measures of baroreflex sensitivity. We studied the determinants of these measures obtained from cardiovascular autonomic function tests in the Hoorn Study. Methods. The study group (n = 631) consisted of a glucose-tolerance-stratified sample from a 50 - to 75 - year-old group of people. Cardiac cycle duration (RR interval) and continuous finger arterial pressure were measured under three conditions: during (a) spontaneous breathing, (b) six deep breaths over one minute, and (c) an active change in position from lying to standing. From these readings, ten measures of autonomic function were assessed (three Ewing, six heart-rate variability and one baroreflex sensitivity). As possible determinants we considered age, sex, glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease, use of anti- hypertensive drugs, anthropometric factors, metabolic factors and lifestyle factors. Results. Multivariate analysis showed that eight of ten cardiovascular autonomic function measures were most strongly associated with glucose tolerance. Furthermore, measures were moderately associated with age, sex, waist-to-hip ratio, use of anti-hypertensive drugs, and insulin. The measures were weakly associated With coronary artery disease but not with lipids. The strongest determinants seemed to differ between subjects with and without diabetes: in the non-diabetic subjects the most strongly associated were age and use of anti-hypertensive drugs and in subjects with diabetes, insulin. No consistent differences in association between the three <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> were observed. Conclusion/interpretation.

This paper presents nine categories of barriers and four <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> to overcome the barriers and to promote sustainable building practices, drawn from qualitative research undertaken with thirty Malaysian building stakeholders via in-depth, semi-structured interviews. The primary barriers that were identified by the stakeholders are: 1) a lack of expressed interest in the clients’ requirements; 2) a lack of political will, legislation and enforcement; 3) a lack of technical understanding among project team members; 4) a lack of consideration of sustainability measures by project team members; and 5) real and perceived costs. Whilst measures suggested by the stakeholders {{are related to the}} government and regulatory stakeholders, research and education sector, private sector, and clients of the construction industry.

40|$|Background: Dysfunctional {{breathing}} (DB) is {{implicated in}} {{physical and psychological}} health, however evaluation is hampered by lack of rigorous definition and clearly defined measures. Screening tools for DB include biochemical measures such as end-tidal CO 2, biomechanical measures such assessments of breathing pattern, breathing symptom questionnaires and tests of breathing function such as breath holding time. Aim: This study investigates whether screening tools for dysfunctional breathing measure distinct or associated aspects of breathing functionality. Method: 84 self-referred or practitioner-referred individuals with concerns about their breathing were assessed using screening tools proposed to identify DB. Correlations between these measures were determined. Results: Significant correlations where found within <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> however ccorrelations between variables in different categories were generally not significant. No measures were found to correlate with carbon dioxide levels. Conclusion: DB cannot be simply defined. For practical purposes DB is probably best characterised as a multi-dimensional construct with at least 3 dimensions, biochemical, biomechanical and breathing related symptoms. Comprehensive evaluation of breathing dysfunction should include measures of breathing symptoms, breathing pattern, resting CO 2 and also include functional measures such a breath holding time and response of breathing to physical and psychological challenges including stress testing with CO 2 monitoring. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Finding {{interesting}} association {{rules is}} an important and active research field in data mining. The algorithms of the Apriori family are based on two rule extraction measures, support and confidence. Although these two measures have the virtue of being algorithmically fast, they generate a prohibitive number of rules {{most of which are}} redundant and irrelevant. It is therefore necessary to use further measures which filter uninteresting rules. Many synthesis studies were then realized on the interestingness measures according to several points of view. Different reported studies have been carried out to identify "good" properties of rule extraction measures and these properties have been assessed on 61 measures. The {{purpose of this paper is}} twofold. First to extend the number of the measures and properties to be studied, in addition to the formalization of the properties proposed in the literature. Second, in the light of this formal study, to categorize the studied measures.

Using objective indices of crime, {{about half of}} the measures evaluated were found to be effective. Successes were documented in all six <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures,</b> but target removal or modification enjoyed the largest number of successes and social and community services the least. BACKGROUND In the winter of 1987 - 8 when this research was being planned, a somewhat depressed view had emerged about the viability of crime prevention activities. The great surge of interest in crime prevention programs in the U. S., begun in the late 1960 s, had all but ended by the early 1980 s. In Britain, the political commitment to crime prevention had arrived later and still continued, but many of the results seemed disappointing. The influence of the American academic community had ensured that many of the crime prevention programs developed in the United States were evaluated by academic researchers. (See, for example, Heller et al., 1975; Tien et al., 1979; and Rosenbaum, 1986 and 1988.) This tradition of evaluation had also been followed in Britain, though with perhaps less enthusiasm and less vigor than in North America...|$|E

During a two-year study period, 223 relevés have been established and 13 plant associations were described. The floristic compositions and abundance patterns of all plant associations were also determined to evaluate the species diversity and richness of the study area. The richness of vascular plant species (α diversity) and the species turnover (β diversity) were calculated by different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> often used to quantify biodiversity within habitats. A total of 1024 vascular plant taxa, including 73 endemics and 105 threatened plant species, were recorded from the whole area (80 436 ha).

This association belongs to the alliance Lilio pontici–Anemonion narcissiflorae. The alliance is represented by two associations and the new association is described. The similarity between these associations, based on the Sorensen Index, was 32. 3 %. In terms of diversity of the study area, some significant differences were found among the 13 associations, and the species richness varied between 13. 64 (min.) and 28. 88 (max.).
