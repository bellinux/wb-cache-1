40|$|Unemployment is {{currently}} {{at a high}} level in South Africa. The Dam Safety Rehabilitation Programme was started in 2005 with the aim of rehabilitating dams belonging to the Department of Water Affairs. Within the ambit of this programme, 33 dams have been rehabilitated as at December 2012, with a further two dams scheduled for completion at the end of March 2013. Several rehabilitation projects have been completed using labour-intensive methods as opposed to conventional construction methods. The labour-intensive methods used on the dam rehabilitation projects include the use of <b>rubble</b> <b>masonry</b> concrete and brickwork as opposed to using conventional construction methods, for example, mass- and reinforced concrete. The aim of the research is to probe the impact of the labour-intensive rehabilitation methods as compared with conventional construction methods. Five dam rehabilitation projects were investigated for this project. Three <b>rubble</b> <b>masonry</b> concrete dam rehabilitation projects were researched in Limpopo Province, namely, Molepo Dam (spillway), Chuniespoort Dam (spillway and parapet wall) and Mashashane Dam (spillway). Two other dam rehabilitation projects were included for comparison purposes: Klein Maricopoort Dam (in North West Province), a conventional concrete spillway project, and Albert Falls Dam (in KwaZulu-Natal), a brick parapet wall project. This research explores three key areas, namely, production rates, cost and productivity. The findings of the research may be generalisable to other labour-intensive construction on dam rehabilitation projects. The findings indicate that production rates (man-hours/m 3), decrease with larger volumes of <b>rubble</b> <b>masonry</b> concrete placed. When comparing <b>rubble</b> <b>masonry</b> concrete con-struction with conventional concrete construction, there is an increase in job oppor-tunities created. The costs of construction using <b>rubble</b> <b>masonry</b> concrete compared with conventional concrete using the same in-house public sector contractor were similar in terms of ZAR per m 3. The <b>rubble</b> <b>masonry</b> concrete structure constructed by the private sector contractor cost less than the <b>rubble</b> <b>masonry</b> concrete structures constructed by the in-house public sector contractor in terms of ZAR per m 3. Various reasons for the price difference are identified in the research project. Productivity (m 3 /person/day) was measured for the different <b>rubble</b> <b>masonry</b> concrete sites and {{it was found that the}} private contractor’s productivity rate was well above the productivity rates of the in-house public sector contractor’s projects. The research report highlights various reasons to explain this anomaly. The importance of an incentive scheme to boost productivity on a labour-intensive project is highlighted. The findings of this research project may provide a guide for future decision making into the use of labour-intensive constructive methods for dam rehabilitation. The research concludes that labour-intensive rehabilitation of dams should be continued since it results in a technically sound and cost-competitive product and creates more productive labour opportunities per unit of expenditure...|$|R

5|$|Pennsylvania has a {{long history}} of stone arch bridges, {{including}} the oldest such bridge in use in the United States, the 1697 Frankford Avenue Bridge over Pennypack Creek in Philadelphia. Such bridges typically used local stone, with three types of finishing possible. <b>Rubble</b> or third-class <b>masonry</b> construction used stones just as they came from the quarry; squared-stone or second-class masonry used stones that had been roughly dressed and squared; and ashlar or first-class masonry used stones which had been finely dressed and carefully squared. <b>Rubble</b> <b>masonry</b> was the quickest and cheapest for construction, and had the largest tolerances. Many of the oldest stone bridges in Pennsylvania were built using <b>rubble</b> <b>masonry</b> techniques.|$|R

40|$|<b>Rubble</b> <b>masonry</b> mortars are {{distinct}} to the masonry mortar joints {{due to the}} different construction techniques used and the prerequisites concerning their behavior in the structure. In the present work, physico-chemical and mineralogical examination of <b>rubble</b> <b>masonry</b> mortars is performed {{on the development of}} cohesion and adhesion bonds. A working hypothesis on production technology is deduced consequently. Recent collapses of the <b>rubble</b> <b>masonry</b> at several bastions of the knights' period in the Medieval fortifications of Rhodes allow for sampling. Investigations by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, fiber optics microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, differential thermogravimetric analysis, porosimetry as well as total soluble salts measurements were performed. Various types of <b>rubble</b> <b>masonry</b> mortars are evidenced and all of them present a very coherent matrix, either 'cementitious' or very finely crystallised and compact. From the top {{to the bottom of the}} masonry, different microstructural characteristics are observed in the mortar nucleus, indicating different lime-to-aggregates ratios. The microstructural stratification of the cementing material points out different carbonation and drying levels and implies successive supply of water to stake the lime in situ. The evidence of hydraulic components all around the bulk, but not on the outer top of the walls, is of particular interest and proves the in situ slaking of lime as the energy source to activate either hydraulic reactions among lime and clay minerals or the crystallization of portlandite. The high levels of soluble salts measured indicate the mortars' susceptibility to salt decay, specifically when pore size distribution is in favor, as in the case of the modern cement or the pure calcitic mortar, in comparison with the more resistant hydraulic mortars.
