Nursing management focus on developing computerized records to answer legal, managerial and clinical needs. The Classification systems help organizations to use nursing data. This study investigated informational and structural needs of nursing data classification. Methods & Materials: This descriptive-comparative study {{was carried out in}} 2009. Current classification systems for nursing were investigated and their specifications were gathered in a questionnaire. The items were prioritized by experts in four degrees. Using statistical analysis items with a priority over 80 percent (average 2. 4) were selected. Results: Findings about nursing diagnosis, intervention and outcomes showed that diagnosis item (average 2. 93 out of 3), intervention item (average 2. 52 out of 3), and outcome item (average 2. 84 out of 3) should be presented in the system. Structure of nursing data classification was identified as a hierarchical and combinational classification. The <b>computerized</b> <b>terminology</b> (average 1. 86 out of 3) had no priority. Conclusion: It is suggested to make decisions for standardizing nursing data to use in computerized systems.

40|$|Colloque sur invitation. internationale. International audienceThere {{is always}} some {{distance}} between the technical constraints that are expressed in an international standard and the actual usage an implementer can make out {{of them in the}} practical settings of its company or institution. This is all the more true for ISO 16642 (Computer applications in Terminology Terminology Markup Framework), which does not provide one single computer format for representing <b>computerized</b> <b>terminologies,</b> but rather focuses on the underlying model that any such format should be conformant with. As a consequence, it is essential to make further studies on how specific usage scenarios may lead to even more constraints on the possible data models, so that general trends can be identified and, possibly, made explicit as recommendations to the final-end users. One possible format for such recommendations will of course be the identification of data category selections (DCS) that may characterize families of interoperable data structures {{on the basis of the}} set of data categories made available by ISO standard 12620 (Computer applications in Terminology Data Categories). In this context, our paper will explore three particular situations that will be qualified according to the condition of production or consumption of terminological data, and accordingly for which the core of a possible standard DCS will be described. The three situations are the following ones: - the unification of several thesauri and term banks within a nationwide scientific documentation center; - the initial deployment of a terminology component within a large industrial group; - the definition of a pivot representation for terminology extraction components that can transparently articulate the output of such software with higher level knowledge management components. As we shall see, the flexibility offered by ISO 16642 as well as its sound principles allow us to carry such specification tasks without precluding any further evolution in those various applicative contexts. We will also see how the methodology outlined in this paper allows us to provide wider information architectures combining two or more of the scenarios that we have identified...|$|R

40|$|M. A. (Linguistics) Unlike in {{the natural}} {{sciences}}, the study fields {{of the social sciences}} are closely related and large areas overlap - with regard to the use of terminology as well. However there are also differences, and in an institution such as the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) which comprises a heterogeneous community of subject specialists, not only the different subjects fields are represented, but also the different schools of thought (universities). In order to conduct human sciences research, the subject specialists should communicate with one another within these subject fields, but also across the borders of the different human sciences disciplines. The aim {{of this study was to}} standardize selected human sciences terminology used in the HSRC in order to provide a source of such terminology to be used mainly by HSRC personnel, and to enhance communication in this way. A theoretical review of the fields of standardization and sUbject lexicography was given. The former field was subdivided into linguistic standardization, technical language standardization and organizational standardization, and a clear organizational standardization process was distinguished on the basis of the steps of collecting, submitting, processing and distributing terminology. The field of subject lexicography concerned technical dictionaries and terminology lists, and the issue of <b>computerizing</b> <b>terminology</b> was also dealt with. The organizational standardization process with respect to HSRC terminology was explained and problematic terms identified in the study were discussed. The terminology involved in the study had been collected over a number of years by the language practitioners at the Centre for Language Services eCLS) of the HSRC, recorded on cards and later entered into the computer. In the study the terminology was submitted to the various sUbject specialists in the HSRC for their comment and approval, and their comments were subsequently researched and discussed by the CLS. The next step in the standardization process involves the processing of the comments so that the terminology can be distributed in the form of a publication or by means of a computerized database. The use of standardized terminology in the HSRC can contribute greatly towards improving communication between subject specialists and if the computerized information is transferred to the National Term Bank of the National Terminology Services as planned, the standardized HSRC terminology can be of use outside the HSRC as well...|$|R

40|$|International audienceLog files {{generated}} by computational systems contain relevant and essential information. In some application areas like {{the design of}} integrated circuits, log files {{generated by}} design tools contain information {{which can be used}} in management information systems to evaluate the final products. However, the complexity of such textual data raises some challenges concerning the extraction of information from log files. Log files are usually multi-source, multi-format, and have a heterogeneous and evolving structure. Moreover, they usually do not respect natural language grammar and structures even though they are written in English. Classical methods of information extraction such as terminology extraction methods are particularly irrelevant to this context. In this paper, we introduce our approach Exterlog to extract <b>terminology</b> from log <b>files.</b> We detail how it deals with the specific features of such textual data. The performance is emphasized by favoring the most relevant terms of the domain based on a scoring function which uses a Web and context based measure. The experiments show that Exterlog is a well-adapted approach for terminology extraction from log files...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In many {{application}} areas, systems reports occurring {{events in}} a kind of textual data called usually log files. Log files report the status of systems, products, or even causes of problems that can occur. The Information extracted from log files of computing systems can be considered one of the important resources of information systems. Log files are considered as a kind of “complex textual data”, i. e. the multi-source, heterogeneous, andmulti-format data. In this paper, we aim particularly at exploring the lexical structure of these log files in order to extract the terms used in log files. These terms will be used in the building of domain ontology and also in enrichment of features of log files corpus. According to features of such textual data, applying the classical methods of information extraction is not an easy task, more particularly for terminology extraction. Here, we introduce a new developed version of EXTERLOG, our approach to extract the <b>terminology</b> from log <b>files,</b> which is guided by Web to evaluate the extracted terms. We score the extracted terms by a Web and context based measure. We favor the more relevant terms of domain and emphasize the precision by filtering terms based on their scores. The experiments show that EXTERLOG is well-adapted terminology extraction approach from log files. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{current trends}} {{in the use of}} anonymity services among younger Swedes (15 - 25) and focuses on individuals engaging in illegal file sharing in order to better understand the rationale behind both file sharing as well as online anonymity, especially in relation to enforcement of copyright. By comparing the findings of a survey conducted on three different occasions (early 2009, late 2009 and early 2012), we measure the fluctuations in the use of anonymity services among approximately 1, 000 15 - 25 -year olds in Sweden, compare them to file sharing frequencies and, to some extent, trends within legal enforcement. The article also suggests that the key to understanding any relationship between copyright enforcement and fluctuations in online anonymity {{can be found in the}} law’s relationship to social norms in terms of legitimacy by showing a correlation between file sharing frequency and the use of anonymity services. The findings indicate that larger proportions of frequent file sharers (downloaders) also use anonymity services more often than those who file share less. However, in comparison to the earlier surveys, the strongest increase in the use of anonymity services is found in the groups where file sharing is less frequent, suggesting that reasons for actively making oneself less traceable online other than avoiding copyright enforcement have emerged since the initial two surveys in 2009. Further, the overall increase (from 8. 6 % to 14. 9 %) in using anonymity services found for the whole group of respondents suggests both that high file sharing frequency is a driver for less traceability as well as a larger trend for online anonymity relating to other factors than mere file sharing of copyright infringing content – for example, increased governmental identification, data retention and surveillance in the online environment. The results are analysed in Merton’s <b>terminology</b> as <b>file</b> sharers and protocol architects adapting in terms of both innovation and rebellion in the sense that institutional means for achieving specific cultural goals are rejected. This means, to some extent, participating in or contributing to the construction of other means for reaching cultural goals...|$|R
