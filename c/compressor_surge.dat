For example, it may be prudent for the flight crew to shut down an engine and perform a precautionary landing {{in the event of}} a low oil pressure or high oil temperature warning in the cockpit. However, passengers in a jet powered aircraft may become quite alarmed by other engine events such as a <b>compressor</b> <b>surge</b> — a malfunction that is typified by loud bangs and even flames from the engine’s inlet and tailpipe. A <b>compressor</b> <b>surge</b> is a disruption of the airflow through a gas turbine jet engine that can be caused by engine deterioration, a crosswind over the engine’s inlet, ingestion of foreign material, or an internal component failure such as a broken blade. While this situation can be alarming, the engine may recover with no damage.|$|E

50|$|Although it {{appeared}} that the basic design was able to deliver its promised performance, at that point it was far from a complete design.

2500|$|The {{cause for}} this [...] is the {{separation}} of the flow from the blade surfaces. This effect {{can be explained by the}} flow over an air foil. When the angle of incidence increases (during the low velocity flow) at the [...] entrance of the air foil, flow pattern changes and separation occurs. This is the first stage of stalling and through this separation point the flow separates leading to the formation of vortices, back flow in the separated region. For a further the explanation of stall and rotating stall, refer to <b>compressor</b> <b>surge.</b> The stall zone for the single axial fan and axial fans operated in parallel are shown in the figure.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2005 SAE International The {{transient}} {{operation of}} turbocharged diesel engines during turbocharger <b>compressor</b> <b>surging</b> is investigated through simulation. This form of compressor dynamic instability can generate large amplitude compressor mass flow and pressure rise oscillations, sometimes leading even to flow reversals, {{and may also}} induce severe torsional loading to the turbocharger shaft. A model predicting the dynamic behavior of the engine air-charging system when <b>compressor</b> <b>surging</b> occurs was developed {{in conjunction with a}} linearized quasi-steady diesel engine simulation code. This analysis possesses the advantage over the more detailed engine codes of basic simplicity, speed of calculation and no need of many engine and turbocharger components parameters given as input data. Emphasis is given to the correct modeling of the physics of the phenomena concerned. Transient operation runs, including critical cases for surging initiation, were applied for two similar six-cylinder diesel engines. The first one is a Ruston & Hornsby engine for light duty automotive diesel applications, while the second one is a MWM marine duty diesel engine.

50|$|The NTSB {{examined}} why {{the plane}} was unable to climb once it departed the runway. After conducting airplane performance studies, the NTSB determined that the events of Flight 1141 could only {{be explained by the}} aircraft attempting to take off without its flaps and slats extended to the proper take-off configuration. The aircraft's instability and sudden roll to the right was consistent with known performance of the Boeing 727 with the flaps and slats retracted. The captain continued to pull back on the control column in an attempt to keep the plane's nose raised, which created turbulence over the rear-mounted engines and caused the <b>compressor</b> <b>surges.</b> However, the NTSB concluded that the <b>compressor</b> <b>surges</b> would not have significantly reduced the engines' thrust, and that the plane's failure to gain speed was due to aerodynamic drag on the aircraft due to the high angle of attack, rather than a loss of engine thrust. The NTSB examined the CVR and noted that neither pilot is heard announcing the deployment of the flaps or slats, nor is the sound of the flap lever movement heard. The NTSB considered it extremely unlikely that a pilot would have moved either the flaps or the slats without announcing their actions {{to the rest of the}} flight crew. Based on the aircraft's failure to climb at takeoff speed, its roll instability, and the absence of sounds indicating the flaps or slats were deployed, the NTSB determined that the plane's failure to climb resulted from the flight crew's failure to deploy the flaps and slats as required by the pre-flight checklist.|$|R

40|$|Overall {{trends for}} next {{generation}} aero-engines are oriented to more efficient architectures {{to ensure a}} reduction in fuel consumption and an improvement in expected ranges, emissions levels and operability. Engine manufacturers have investigated different ways to improve engine performance, for instance by using new materials, technologies or integration methods. Engine performance can also be improved though changes in thermodynamic cycle by means of variable cycle devices capable of better adapting it to flight conditions. Due to current design constraints, engines are optimized to best average performance for a specific mission type, yet not for all the operating points encountered throughout the missions. By adding a degree of freedom, the cycle can be further optimized during the entire mission potentially leading to additional fuel savings. This paper presents {{an analysis of the}} impact of variable fan and core nozzle areas on the performance of a long range turbofan through a long range mission. By moving the operating points, these devices have a strong effect on engine operations and therefore on the Specific Fuel Consumption. Variations in Specific Fuel Consumption are evaluated as well as <b>compressors</b> <b>surge</b> margins, considered as important performance and operability parameters, throughout the same 14 hours long range mission and for range of +/- 15 % for the fan nozzle area and +/- 20 % for the core nozzle area. This study shows that optimization of the fan nozzle area on each mission point for minimum SFC can lead to fuel savings of up to 20 kg (44 lb) representing 0. 05 % of improvement. However, maximizing the surge margin by optimizing the variable fan nozzle permits an increase of up to 7 % depending on the considered compressor. On the other hand, optimization of the core nozzle area on each mission point for minimum specific fuel consumption allows a reduction of 127 kg (282 lb) in fuel consumption, representing an improvement of 0. 34 % while having different effects on the engine <b>compressors</b> <b>surge</b> margins. Using the core area to maximize the surge margin provides an increase of up to 2 % depending on the considered compressor with a side effect on specific fuel consumption. At this stage, the results from this study suggest that the amount of fuel savings obtained through the use of variable fan nozzle and variable core nozzle may not be sufficient to overcome the associated constraints such as added weight and integration aspects. However, a broader optimization approach,involving all the design aspects and parameters could lead to different quantitative conclusions...|$|R

It is likely that, when the pilots regained visual ground contact, they quickly pulled up, overloading the horizontal stabiliser downwards and a main wing spar upwards. It was dismissed by officials who said that it was not authentic and was not the original recording.|$|R
