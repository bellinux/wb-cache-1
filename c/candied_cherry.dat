2500|$|Ithaca {{claims to}} be the birthplace of the ice cream sundae, created in 1892 when {{fountain}} shop owner Chester Platt [...] "served his local priest vanilla ice cream covered in cherry syrup with a dark <b>candied</b> <b>cherry</b> on top. The priest suggested the dessert be named after the day, Sunday — although the spelling was later changed out of fear some would find it offensive." [...] The local Unitarian church, where the priest, Rev. John Scott, preached, has an annual [...] "Sundae Sunday" [...] every September in commemoration. Ithaca's claim has long been disputed by Two Rivers, Wisconsin. Also in 1892, the Ithaca Kitty {{became one of the first}} mass-produced stuffed animal toys in the United States.|$|E
50|$|The merveilleux (marvelous) {{is a small}} cake that {{originated}} in Belgium and is now found in France and some U.S. cities. It consists of a sandwich of two light meringues welded with whipped cream which has been covered with whipped cream and dusted with chocolate shavings. A <b>candied</b> <b>cherry</b> sometimes decorates the cake.|$|E
5000|$|The Cassatella di Sant'Agata (pl. cassatelle)—colloquially named Minni di Vergini, meaning [...] "virgin breasts"—is {{a similar}} dessert, but {{made in a}} smaller, personal-serving size, with a <b>candied</b> <b>cherry</b> on top, and often a {{specifically}} green-coloured marzipan. It is typically made in Catania for the festival of Saint Agatha. The allusion to the female breast relates the specific torture Saint Agatha faced as a Catholic martyr.|$|E

40|$|The {{assumption}} {{of a novel}} high palatable food (a <b>candied</b> <b>cherry)</b> occurs concomitantly {{with an increase in}} the concentration of extra-cellular dopamine and its main metabolite 3, 4 -dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) by about 45 % in the dialysate obtained by intracerebral microdialysis from the shell of the nucleus accumbens of male rats. Such increase was reversed by SR 141716 A (Rimonabant), a selective cannabinoid CB 1 receptor antagonist (0. 3 mg/kg i. p. and 1 mg/kg i. p.), which also reduces the {{assumption of}} the high palatable food, when given 15 min before exposure to the <b>candied</b> <b>cherry.</b> SR 141716 A effects on extracellular dopamine and DOPAC were prevented by WIN 55, 212 - 2 (0. 3 mg/kg i. p.) or HU 210 (0. 1 mg/kg i. p.) given 15 min before SR 141716 A. The present results show {{for the first time that}} SR 141716 A reduces the increase in extra-cellular dopamine induced by a novel high palatable food in the nucleus accumbens. This confirms that cannabinoid CB 1 receptors play a key role in food intake and/or appetite and suggests that the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is involved at least in part, in the effects of cannabinoid receptor agonists and antagonists on food intake and/or appetite...|$|E
50|$|Florentines {{are made}} of nuts (typically {{hazelnuts}} and almonds) and <b>candied</b> <b>cherries</b> mixed with sugar melted together with butter and honey, cooked in an oven. They are often coated on the bottom with chocolate. Other types of candied fruit are used as well. They typically contain neither flour nor eggs.|$|R
5000|$|Puding Diraja - {{also known}} as Royal Pudding, this dessert was {{developed}} and served to the royal family of Pahang state. Its basic ingredients are pisang lemak manis (a local cultivar of banana), evaporated milk, prunes, <b>candied</b> <b>cherries</b> and cashew nuts. The pudding is garnished with jala emas, and served with a cold sauce made from milk and cornflour. Nowadays it is popularly served during Ramadan, {{as well as a}} special afternoon tea treat for the family on weekends.|$|R
2500|$|Wine expert Andre Dominé {{notes that}} the flavour of Maury {{will depend on how}} long it has been aged prior to {{bottling}} with the youngest [...] "first phase" [...] Maury wines having <b>candied</b> <b>cherries,</b> fresh figs and stewed fruit aromas while [...] "second phase" [...] wines will develop more dried fruits flavours of raisins, prunes and apricots. Longer aging, seven years or more, will give the wine caramel, cocoa, tobacco and coffee notes while rancio style will have green walnut husk and aromas similar to cognacs and vin jaune wines from the Jura.|$|R
6000|$|The tree {{looked as}} if made of glass or colored sugar; for she {{could see through the}} red cherries, the green leaves, and the brown branches. An {{agreeable}} smell met her nose; and she said at once, as any child would, [...] "I smell candy!" [...] She picked a cherry and ate it. Oh, how good it was!--all sugar and no stone. The next discovery was such a delightful one that she nearly fell off her perch; for by touching her tongue here and there, she found that the whole tree was made of candy. Think what fun to sit and break off twigs of barley sugar, <b>candied</b> <b>cherries,</b> and leaves that tasted like peppermint and sassafras! ...|$|R
5000|$|Supporting Ithacas {{claim to}} be [...] "the birthplace of the ice cream sundae", {{researchers}} at The History Center in Tompkins County, New York, provide an account of how the sundae came to be: On Sunday, April 3, 1892, in Ithaca, John M. Scott, a Unitarian Church minister, and Chester Platt, co-owner of Platt & Colt Pharmacy, created the first historically documented sundae. Platt covered dishes of ice cream with <b>cherry</b> syrup and <b>candied</b> <b>cherries</b> on a whim. The men named the dish [...] "Cherry Sunday" [...] {{in honor of the}} day it was created. The oldest-known written evidence of a sundae is Platt & Colt's newspaper ad for a [...] "Cherry Sunday" [...] placed in the Ithaca Daily Journal on April 5, 1892. By May 1892, the Platt & Colt soda fountain also served [...] "Strawberry Sundays" [...] and later, [...] "Chocolate Sundays".|$|R
5000|$|Besides its {{nickname}} [...] "the pencil", {{the tower}} has inspired several items including a chocolate version. It {{is composed of}} black chocolate, more than 70% of cocoa of maraschino (bitter cherry liqueur), the <b>cherries</b> <b>candied</b> and chocolate milk.|$|R
50|$|Fruits {{that are}} {{commonly}} <b>candied</b> include dates, <b>cherries,</b> pineapple, and a root, ginger. The principal candied peels are orange and citron; these with candied lemon peel are the usual ingredients of mixed chopped peel (which may also include glacé cherries).|$|R

40|$|Transcription begins] February 3, 1943 Dear Miss Blaney, Several {{days ago}} I {{received}} a letter from The Bryant college Service Club initially addressed to my parents living in Providence and forwarded to me by them. I am enclosing the letter in the hope that it may help clarify what follows herein. On or about last December tenth I received two pound boxes of <b>candied</b> <b>cherries</b> with the greetings of Bryant College. I was at that time stationed at Ft. Benning, Georgia. As I was to have a leave of ten days starting on the sixteenth of December I did not acknowledge the present by mail, but while home in Providence a few days later I visited good old Bryant, had a very pleasant talk with Mr. Ripley during which time I thanked Bryant through Mr. Ripley for their generous gift. I’m mighty sorry if I have caused you any inconvenience Miss Blaney; you may be sure the chocolates were appreciated. I think the idea of a Service Club strictly “Bryant’s Own” is swell, and I’m sure the other fellows in the service appreciate your interest in us as much as I know I do. Would it be possible to have our school paper sent directly to me? My folks always forward it and I sure do enjoy it but as it is it has to be remailed to me each month. I’d be only too glad to pay any expense it might incur. My address now is: Lieut. Earle C. Bowers, Jr. Company “C,” 346 th Infantry Camp McCain, Mississippi Again, many thanks for your interest and generous gift. Yours very truly, Earle C. Bowers, Jr. [Transcription ends...|$|R
50|$|Cassata or Cassata siciliana is a {{traditional}} sweet from all areas of Sicily, Italy, born in Palermo. Cassata consists of round sponge cake moistened with fruit juices or liqueur and layered with ricotta cheese and chocolate chips (which is also the cannoli's filling). It {{is covered with a}} shell of marzipan, pink and green pastel colored icing, and decorative designs. The cassata is topped with <b>candied</b> fruit depicting <b>cherries</b> and slices of citrus fruit characteristic of Sicily. Cassata may also refer to a Neapolitan ice cream containing candied or dried fruit and nuts.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThe chemical, sensory and {{microbial}} {{qualities of}} candied-pineapple and cherry cakes were investigated. Both cake samples were also analyzed for chemical composition and microbial load before, {{during and after}} 56 days storage at room temperature. There were significant differences (p< 0. 05) in the physico-chemical composition of the <b>cherry</b> cake and <b>candied</b> pineapple cake except for protein values of 9. 00 % and 8. 63 % respectively and magnesium content with values of 0. 23 % and 0. 27 % respectively. Sensory evaluation results showed significant differences (p< 0. 05) between the two samples {{with the exception of}} colour (7. 84) for both samples and texture (7. 84 and 7. 80) for <b>cherry</b> and <b>candied</b> pineapple cakes, respectively. In terms of general acceptability, the candied-pineapple cake was most preferred (8. 52). The microbial loads (bacterial and fungal) of the candied pineapple cake were lower than the cherry cake throughout the duration of the 56 days storage at room temperature. The highest bacterial load was recorded after the 28 th day (148. 0 × 105 cfu/g) and (194. 30 × 105 cfu/g) for <b>candied</b> pineapple and <b>cherry</b> cakes respectively. The fungal load was also highest at 28 th day of storage (14. 33 × 101 cfu/g) and (12. 67 × 103 cfu/g) for <b>candied</b> pineapple and <b>cherry</b> cakes respectively. The total viable counts (TVC) were within acceptable limits for human consumption. Therefore, candied-pineapple can readily substitute cherry in fruit cake making in Nigeria...|$|R
