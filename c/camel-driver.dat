6000|$|... "Now, by Our Lady, Saracen," [...] exclaimed the Christian, [...] "if thou darest name in {{the same}} breath the <b>camel-driver</b> of Mecca with--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... Who now {{of ancient}} Kayomurs, [...] of Zâl or Rustam cares to sing, Whelmed by the tempest {{of the tribes}} [...] that called the <b>Camel-driver</b> King? ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{made him}} look like he wished he hadn't said anything. And he wanted to git away from the subject, I reckon, because he begun to abuse the <b>camel-driver,</b> just the way a person does when he has got catched in {{something}} and wants to take it out of somebody else. He let into the <b>camel-driver</b> the hardest he knowed how, and I had to agree with him; and he praised up the dervish the highest he could, and I had to agree with him there, too. But Tom says: ...|$|E
60|$|The men chuckled by {{the fires}} at the <b>camel-driver's</b> discomfiture. He had {{intended}} to substitute a slow, saddle-galled baggage-colt.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is he {{also one}} of Us?' Kim ducked under a Mewar <b>camel-driver's</b> greasy armpit and cannoned off a covey of jabbering Sikh matrons.|$|R
50|$|The attackers {{were both}} former <b>camel-drivers</b> working at Broken Hill. They were Badsha Mahommed Gool (born c. 1874), an ice-cream vendor, and Mullah Abdullah (born c. 1854), a local imam and halal butcher.|$|R
6000|$|A <b>camel-driver,</b> {{angry with}} his drudge, Beating him, called him hunchback; to the hind Thus spake a dervish: 'Friend, the Eternal Judge Dooms not his work, but ours, the crooked mind.' ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{him and the}} dervish laid into it, {{and they}} loaded every camel till he couldn't carry no more; then they said good-bye, {{and each of them}} started off with his fifty. But pretty soon the <b>camel-driver</b> come a-running and overtook the dervish and says: ...|$|E
60|$|But do you know, it warn't {{ten minutes}} till the <b>camel-driver</b> was {{unsatisfied}} again--he was the lowdownest reptyle in seven counties--and he come a-running again. And {{this time the}} thing he wanted {{was to get the}} dervish to rub some of the salve on his other eye.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Eliezer {{interpreted}} the conjugal duty of [...] to require relations: for men of independence, every day; for laborers, twice a week; for donkey-drivers, once a week; for <b>camel-drivers,</b> once in 30 days; for sailors, once in six months.|$|R
50|$|The {{times for}} {{conjugal}} duty prescribed in the Torah are: for men of independence, every day; for laborers, twice a week; for ass-drivers, once a week; for <b>camel-drivers,</b> once in thirty days; for sailors, once in six months. These are the rulings of R. Eliezer.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 300s AD, Palladius visited the Egyptian monasteries. He {{described}} three hundred {{members of the}} coenobium of Panopolis. There were fifteen tailors, seven smiths, four carpenters, twelve <b>camel-drivers</b> and fifteen tanners. These people were divided into subgroups, {{each with its own}} [...] "oeconomus". A chief steward was {{at the head of the}} monastery.|$|R
6000|$|Of {{course the}} <b>camel-driver</b> {{wanted to know}} what kind of a chance he had missed, because maybe there was money in it; so he run after the dervish, and begged him so hard and earnest to take pity on him that at last the dervish gave in, and says: ...|$|E
60|$|So {{then the}} <b>camel-driver</b> {{was in a}} sweat; and he cried, and begged, and took on, and went down on his knees, {{and said he was}} just that kind of a man, and said he could fetch a {{thousand}} people that would say he wasn't ever described so exact before.|$|E
6000|$|A dervish was stumping {{it along}} through the Desert, on foot, one blazing hot day, {{and he had}} come a {{thousand}} miles and was pretty poor, and hungry, and ornery and tired, and along about {{where we are now}} he run across a <b>camel-driver</b> with a hundred camels, and asked him for some a'ms. But the cameldriver he asked to be excused. The dervish said: ...|$|E
60|$|We {{were willing}} {{to get out of}} this Place as soon as we could; for we found the Peoples Rage, which wanted an Object to vent itself upon, began to {{threaten}} us again: So having pack'd up our Goods, and gotten five ordinary <b>Camel-Drivers</b> for our Servants in the Country, we set out again.|$|R
5000|$|Wongatha people {{played an}} {{important}} role in the discovery of gold and supporting early prospectors with information about locally available gnamma holes. They also assisted with early so-called Afghan <b>camel-drivers,</b> instrumental in providing outback gold mining communities with provisions. As with Jack Akbar and his wife Lallie, there were a number of Muslim-Aboriginal marriages that resulted from this work ...|$|R
5000|$|In a Persian Market is a {{piece of}} light {{classical}} music for orchestra with optional chorus by Albert Ketèlbey who composed it in 1920. Subtitled Intermezzo Scene, it was published by Bosworth in 1921. It evokes exotic images of <b>camel-drivers,</b> jugglers, and snake-charmers. When it was first published in a version for piano, it was advertised as an [...] "educational novelty".|$|R
60|$|So he done it, {{and they}} {{separated}} and the dervish started off again with his forty. But pretty soon {{here comes the}} <b>camel-driver</b> bawling after him again, and whines and slobbers around and begs another ten off of him, saying thirty camel loads of treasures was enough to see a dervish through, because they live very simple, you know, and don't keep house, but board around and give their note.|$|E
6000|$|He put {{one hand}} on the man's forearm and ran the other down the plump body beneath the coat. [...] "My goodness!" [...] said he to Torpenhow, [...] "and this gray oaf dares to be a thief! I have seen an Esneh <b>camel-driver</b> have the black hide taken off his body in strips for {{stealing}} half a pound of wet dates, and he was as tough as whipcord. This thing's soft all over--like a woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{made the}} <b>camel-driver</b> feel shaky, {{but all the}} same he was born hoggish after money and didn't like to let go a cent; so he begun to whine and explain, and said times was hard, and {{although}} he had took a full freight down to Balsora and got a fat rate for it, he couldn't git no return freight, and so he warn't making no great things out of his trip. So the dervish starts along again, and says: ...|$|E
6000|$|So we fetched our {{rifles and}} cartridges, to which by an afterthought we added two large water-bottles, and ate a hearty breakfast. As we were {{preparing}} to start, Shadrach, {{the leader of the}} Abati <b>camel-drivers,</b> that man with the scarred face who was nicknamed the Cat, {{came up to me and}} asked me whither we were going. I told him, whereon he said: ...|$|R
6000|$|Said Saadi, [...] "When I {{stood before}} Hassan the <b>camel-driver's</b> door, I scorned the fame of Timour brave; Timour, to Hassan, was a slave. In every glance of Hassan's eye I read great years of victory, And I, who cower mean and small In the {{frequent}} interval When wisdom {{not with me}} resides, Worship Toil's wisdom that abides. I shunned his eyes, that faithful man's, I shunned the toiling Hassan's glance." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the black}} dusk had shut down, the Englishman climbed {{up a little}} hill and saw the stars come out and shine over the desert. Very far away, some <b>camel-drivers</b> had lighted a fire and were singing as they sat {{by the side of}} their beasts. Sound travels as far over sand as over water, and their voices came into the city wall and beat against it in multiplied echoes.|$|R
60|$|The {{girls were}} still in male attire, and rode in large baskets, slung {{one on each side}} of a camel. The <b>camel-driver</b> walked {{at the head of the}} animal, leading it by a cord. Its fellows {{followed}} in a long line, each fastened to the one before it. Jethro, Amuba, and Chebron, all armed with bows and arrows, as well as swords, rode beside the girls' camel. Half the escort went on ahead; the other half formed the rear guard.|$|E
6000|$|Mainly we laid on {{our backs}} and talked; we didn't {{want to go to}} sleep. Tom said we was right {{in the midst of the}} Arabian Nights now. He said it was right along here that one of the cutest things in that book happened; so we looked down and watched while he told about it, because there ain't {{anything}} that is so interesting to look at as a place that a book has talked about. It was a tale about a <b>camel-driver</b> that had lost his camel, and he come along in the desert and met a man, and says: ...|$|E
60|$|As {{the glare}} of day mellowed into twilight, we looked down upon a picture which is celebrated all over the world. I think I have read about four hundred times that when Mahomet was a simple <b>camel-driver</b> he reached this point and looked down upon Damascus for the first time, and then made a certain renowned remark. He said man could enter only one paradise; he {{preferred}} {{to go to the}} one above. So he sat down there and feasted his eyes upon the earthly paradise of Damascus, and then went away without entering its gates. They have erected a tower on the hill to mark the spot where he stood.|$|E
500|$|Before the British {{advance to}} El Arish could begin, the [...] stretch without a water supply between El Mazar and El Arish {{had to be}} {{thoroughly}} explored. By mid-December 1916, the pipeline's eastward progress {{made it possible to}} store sufficient water at Maadan (Kilo. 128) and it was also possible to concentrate sufficiently large numbers of Egyptian Camel Transport Corps camels and <b>camel-drivers</b> to carry water forward from Maadan in support of an attacking force.|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} we left Dunwah for Barah (alt. 480 feet), passing over very barren soil, covered with low jungle, the {{original}} woods having apparently been cut for fuel. Our elephant, a timid animal, {{came on a}} drove of camels in the dark by the road-side, and in his alarm insisted on doing battle, tearing through the thorny jungle, regardless of the mahout, and still more of me: the uproar raised by the <b>camel-drivers</b> was ridiculous, and the danger to my barometer imminent.|$|R
50|$|The Burke and Wills {{expedition}} was {{the most}} expensive {{in the history of}} Australian exploration. It cost over £60,000 and would eventually claim seven lives. The expedition was provided with more than two dozen camels, imported complete with cameleers. There were horses and wagons, food for two years and lavish equipment. The party consisted of five officers: Burke, Landells as second-in-command, and William John Wills, third-in-command and surveyor and meteorologist and the two German scientific officers: Becker and Hermann Beckler, medical officer and botanist. The expedition also included a foreman, nine assistants and the <b>camel-drivers.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{was a man}} of firm purpose, and yet at {{the first}} sight of those howling fiends that purpose faltered, and at the second it was blown to the winds. He saw a huge coal-black negro seize a shrieking <b>camel-driver</b> and saw at his throat with a knife. He saw a shock-headed tribesman plunge his great spear through the back of their own little bugler from Mill-street. He saw a dozen deeds of blood--the murder of the wounded, the hacking of the unarmed--and caught, too, in a glance, the good {{wholesome}} faces of the faced-about rear rank of the Marines. The Mallows, too, had faced about, and in an instant Conolly had thrown himself into the heart of C Company, striving with the officers to form the men up with their comrades.|$|E
6000|$|... "Such {{may be your}} maxims in Frangistan," [...] {{replied the}} Soldan. [...] "Our poets of the Eastern {{countries}} say that a valiant <b>camel-driver</b> is worthy to kiss the lip of a fair Queen, when a cowardly prince is not worthy to salute {{the hem of her}} garment. But with your permission, noble brother, I must take leave of thee for the present, to receive the Duke of Austria and yonder Nazarene knight, much less worthy of hospitality, but who must yet be suitably entreated, not for their sakes, but for mine own honour--for what saith the sage Lokman? 'Say not that the food is lost unto thee which is given to the stranger; for if his body be strengthened and fattened therewithal, not less is thine own worship and good name cherished and augmented.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{because he}} knowed the man's character. It {{was just the}} kind of a man he was hunting for--a man that never {{believes}} in anybody's word or anybody's honorableness, because he ain't got none of his own. I reckon there's lots of people like that dervish. They swindle, right and left, but they always make the other person SEEM to swindle himself. They keep inside of {{the letter of the law}} all the time, and there ain't no way to git hold of them. THEY don't put the salve on--oh, no, that would be sin; but they know how to fool YOU into putting it on, then it's you that blinds yourself. I reckon the dervish and the <b>camel-driver</b> was just a pair--a fine, smart, brainy rascal, and a dull, coarse, ignorant one, but both of them rascals, just the same." ...|$|E
5000|$|Palgrave's {{description}} of Manama's coffee {{houses in the}} mid-19th century portrays them as cosmopolitan venues in contrast to {{what he describes as}} the 'closely knit and bigoted universe of central Arabia'. Palgrave describes a people with an open - even urbane - outlook: [...] "Of religious controversy I have never heard one word. In short, instead of Zelators and fanatics, <b>camel-drivers</b> and Bedouins, we have at Bahrain Manama something like 'men of the world, who know the world like men' a great relief to the mind; certainly it was so to mine." ...|$|R

60|$|Kit {{went and}} got a bath, and was {{afterwards}} occupied until Campeador steamed into the Port of Light, when he sent off Wolf's note. Some time afterwards a boat with a Portuguese runner from a big hotel came alongside and they put Scot on board. In the evening Kit went to ask for him, but the clerk declared Scot had not arrived, and he doubted if their runner had gone to meet the correillo. Muleteers and <b>camel-drivers</b> from Arrecife did not stop at fashionable hotels. Kit was forced to be satisfied, but he thought the thing was strange.|$|R
