Substitutes are goods {{that can be used in}} place of the primary good. The mathematical relationship between {{the price of the}} substitute and the demand for the good in question is positive. If the price of the substitute goes down the demand for the good in question goes down.|$|E
50|$|This {{force was}} the sixth force, {{added in the}} revised 1990s model. It refers to {{products}} or services that are compatible with what a particular industry sells. The effect of complementary goods on an industry's profitability generally depends on how reliant the product or service is on the compatible product. If one cannot function without the other, the impact is high. The impact of complementary products can be good or bad for industry profitability. If the <b>complementary</b> <b>good</b> is doing well within its industry this can {{have a positive effect}} on the profitability of a given company. Adversely, if performance is bad or prices rise within the complementary product's market it can negatively impact upon the level of profit that the industry can obtain. For example, when petrol costs rise the public transport industry may suffer reduced profits or be forced increase prices which may cause customers to look for alternatives, e.g. walking and car sharing, again reducing overall profitability of an industry.|$|E
50|$|In economics, a <b>{{complement}}ary</b> <b>good</b> or complement is a {{good with}} a negative cross elasticity of demand, {{in contrast to a}} substitute good. This means a good's demand is increased when the price of another good is decreased. Conversely, the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is increased. If goods A and B are complements, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in; less of each good will be demanded. A decrease in price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve B to shift outward; more of each good will be demanded. Basically this means that since the demand of one good is linked to the demand of another good, if a higher quantity is demanded of one good, a higher quantity will also be demanded of the other, and if a lower quantity is demanded of one good, a lower quantity will be demanded of the other. The prices of complementary goods are related in the same way: if the price of one good rises, so will the price of the other, and vice versa. With substitute goods, however, the price and quantity demanded of one good is related inversely to the price and quantity demanded of a substitute good, meaning that if the price or quantity demanded of one good rises, the price or quantity demanded of its substitute will fall.|$|E

5000|$|In economics, one {{way that}} two or more goods can be {{classified}} is by examining {{the relationship of the}} demand schedules when the price of one good changes. This relationship between demand schedules leads to classification of goods as either substitutes or complements. Substitute goods are goods which, as a result of changed conditions, may replace each other in use (or consumption). [...] A substitute good, in contrast to a <b>complementary</b> <b>good,</b> is a good with a positive cross elasticity of demand. This means a good's demand is increased when the price of another good is increased; both in the same direction. Conversely, the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is decreased. If goods A and B are substitutes, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift out. A decrease in the price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in.Examples of substitute goods include margarine and butter, tea and coffee, beer and wine. Substitute goods not only occur on the consumer side of the market but also the producer side. Substitutable producer goods would include: petroleum and natural gas (used for heating or electricity). The degree to which a good has a perfect substitute depends on how specifically the good is defined. Take for example, the demand for Rice Krispies cereal, which is a very narrowly defined good as compared to the demand for cereal generally. The fact that one good is substitutable for another has immediate economic consequences: insofar as one good can be substituted for another, the demands for the two kinds of good will be interrelated by the fact that customers can trade off one good for the other if it becomes advantageous to do so.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} case of a {{monopolist}} of a base good {{in the presence of a}} <b>complementary</b> <b>good</b> provided either by it or by another firm. We assess and calibrate the extent of the influence of the profits from the base good that is created by the existence of <b>complementary</b> <b>good,</b> i. e., the extent of the network effect. We establish an equivalence between a model of a base and a <b>complementary</b> <b>good</b> and a reduced-form model of the base good in which network effects are assumed in the consumers' utility functions as a surrogate for the presence of direct or indirect network effects, such as complementary goods produced by other firms. We also assess and calibrate the influence on profits of the intensity of network effects and quality improvements in both goods. We evaluate the incentive that a monopolist of the base good has to improve its quality rather than that of the <b>complementary</b> <b>good</b> under different market structures. Finally, based on our results, we discuss a possible explanation of the fact that Microsoft Office has a significantly higher price that Microsoft Windows although both products have comparable market shares. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a new explanation for tying {{that is not}} based on any of the standard explanations – efficiency, price discrimination, and exclusion. Our analysis shows how a monopolist sometimes has an incentive to tie a <b>complementary</b> <b>good</b> to its monopolized good in order to transfer profits from a rival producer of the complementary product to the monopolist. This occurs even when consumers – who have the option to use the monopolist’s <b>complementary</b> <b>good</b> – do not use it. The tie is profitable because it alters the subsequent pricing game between the monopolist and the rival in a manner favorable to the monopolist. We show that this form of tying is socially inefficient, but interestingly can arise only when the tie is socially efficient {{in the absence of the}} rival producer. We relate this inefficient form of tying to several actual examples and explore its antitrust implications...|$|E

40|$|An {{integrated}} monopoly, {{where all}} complements forming a composite good are {{offered by a}} single firm, is typically welfare superior to a complementary monopoly. This is the "tragedy of the anticommons". We consider the possibility of competition {{in the market for}} each complement. We present a model with two perfect complements and introduce n imperfect substitutes for one and then for both complements. We prove that, if one <b>complementary</b> <b>good</b> is produced by a monopolist, and if competition for the other complement does not vary the average quality in the market, then an integrated monopoly is still superior. In such case, favoring competition in some sectors, leaving monopolies in others would be detrimental for consumers and producers alike. Competition may be preferred if and only if the substitutes of the <b>complementary</b> <b>good</b> differ in their quality, so that as their number increases, average quality and/or quality variance increases. Results change when competition is introduced in each sector. In this case, if goods are close substitutes, we find that competition may be welfare superior for {{a relatively small number of}} competing firms in each sector, even with no quality differentiation. ...|$|E
