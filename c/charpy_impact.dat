It leads to a low value of <b>Charpy</b> V-notch <b>impact</b> toughness of 6 J/cm 2. These carbides are highly resistant against the spheroidizing. Only the tempering at 770 °C leads to the final formation of M 23 C 6 carbides having the equiaxed shape. Concurrently, this tempering strongly decreases boron segregation. As a result, the 10 % Cr martensitic steel exhibits a high value of <b>Charpy</b> V-notch <b>impact</b> toughness of 260 J/cm...|$|R

50|$|The ductile-brittle {{transition}} temperature (DBTT), nil ductility temperature (NDT), or nil ductility {{transition temperature}} of a metal is the temperature {{at which the}} fracture energy passes below a predetermined value (for steels typically 40 J for a standard <b>Charpy</b> <b>impact</b> test). DBTT is important since, once a material is cooled below the DBTT, it has a much greater tendency to shatter on impact instead of bending or deforming. For example, zamak 3 exhibits good ductility at room temperature but shatters when impacted at sub-zero temperatures. DBTT {{is a very important}} consideration in selecting materials that are subjected to mechanical stresses.

This is most commonly realized using the <b>Charpy</b> <b>impact</b> test , in which the impact of a pendulum hammer (striker) with a horizontal notched specimen and the height of its subsequent swing-through is used to infer the energy absorbed in fracture of the specimen. Impact testing of notched bars is also applied in the Izod impact strength test, typically applied to a cantilever configuration with a vertically positioned specimen. Charpy testing is conducting with U- or V-notches whereby the striker contacts the specimen directly behind the notch, whereas the now largely obsolete Izod method involves a circular notch facing the striker. Notched specimens find use in other characterization protocols, including tensile testing and fatigue.|$|E
