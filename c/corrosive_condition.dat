40|$|The {{abrasion}} {{behavior of}} high manganese steel is investigated under {{three levels of}} impact energy in acid-ironstone slurry. The wear test {{was carried out by}} an MLDF- 10 tester with impact energy of 0. 7 [*]J, 1. 2 [*]J, and 1. 7 [*]J. The impact abrasion property of high manganese steel in <b>corrosive</b> <b>condition</b> was compared according to the wear mass loss curves. The wear mechanism was analysed by the SEM analysis of the worn surface and the optical metallographic analysis of the vertical section to the wear surface. The results show that the impact energy has a great effect on the impact corrosion and abrasion properties of it. Its abrasion mechanism in <b>corrosive</b> <b>condition</b> is mainly microplough and breakage of plastic deformed ridges and wedges under the impact energy of 0. 7 [*]J.

40|$|The <b>corrosive</b> <b>condition</b> at marine {{splash zone}} is {{detrimental}} to steel structures of offshore applications. The corrosion at splash zone {{is the most}} serious not only for uniformed corrosion but also localized corrosion. Practically, marine structures experience cyclic seasonal temperature change. Temperature acts as an important factor affecting corrosion process. In this paper, the effects of temperature on pitting behavior of a low alloy high strength steel (AISI 4135) in marine splash zone have been investigated using electrochemical techniques and morphology observations. The area of hysteresis loop was greater under seawater film at lower temperatures than that at high temperatures, indicating that the pitting corrosion sensitivity is high at lower temperature.

Cermet consists of ceramic particulate embedded in a metallic binder.

Electrochemical test has been done in three electrolytes namely 0. 5 M hydrochloric acid, HCl, 0. 5 M sulfuric acid, H 2 SO 4 and 0. 5 M sodium hydroxide, NaOH.

40|$|The aim {{of present}} study was to study the {{stability}} of iron carbonate films formed on the surface of low alloy carbon steel used in pipeline applications in brine solution. All the tests were carried out in a stirred autoclave at various temperatures and low partial pressure of CO 2. Usually, American Petroleum Institute (API) specification steels are used for carrying the crude oil and gas from the offshore to refining platforms and ultimately to the customers through pipeline routes. Developed and modified alloy steel of API grade such as API X- 52, API X- 56, API X- 60 and L- 80 are used in this study that are rapidly using in petroleum industries to transport the oil and gas. The first three grade of steel are used for transportation while L- 80 grade is used for tubing and drilling the wells for recovery of oil and gas from offshore. The comparative study of their susceptibility of corrosion in severe <b>corrosive</b> <b>condition</b> has been made by measuring the corrosion rate of steel using weight loss method in simulated 3. 5 % NaCl test solution.

30|$|In this work, we {{divided the}} results of the synergy of {{corrosion}} and mechanical stress for the as-annealed Ni 3 (Si,Ti) and Ni 3 (Si,Ti) with 2 Mo into three regions 1 – 3 in applied stress dependence and A–C in pH dependence while in Cl− ion concentration, the result of those for both intermetallic compounds divided into two regions I–II. The <b>corrosive</b> <b>condition</b> was fixed at 313  K in 0.5  kmol/m 3 NaCl solution, and the three regions were observed with increasing applied stress: No failure region 3 for Ni 3 (Si,Ti) and failure region 3 for Ni 3 (Si,Ti) with 2 Mo where the mechanical stress and corrosiveness were too low to lead failure, region 2 where the mechanical stress became adequate to induce EIC at the given corrosiveness, and region 1 where the mechanical stress is too high to induce EIC at the given corrosiveness, with a consequent mechanical failure. This is defined as stress-dominated region. Moreover, the corrosiveness was changed from high to low by decreasing pH. Corrosion-dominated region is A, where corrosive degradation is too rapid in induced EIC at the applied mechanical stress, leading to final mechanical failure of the specimen, and final cross section is too small to avoid the mechanical failure whereas no corrosion-dominated region occurs in Cl− ion concentration dependence. Regions II and B are the EIC region where both corrosiveness and mechanical stress act synergistically to induce EIC. In regions I and C, both mechanical stress and corrosiveness are too low to lead failure, while the chloride concentration of intermetallic compounds are below their critical chloride concentration in region I although material degradation proceeds by prolonged corrosion. As is well known, EIC occurs by the synergy of mechanical stress and corrosion in regions 2, II, and B. Therefore, let us elucidate the behavior of EIC of these intermetallic compounds.|$|E

40|$|Stainless steels for low {{and high}} {{temperature}} proton exchange membrane fuel cell (LT-/HT-PEMFC) present several advantages over graphitic materials. The fabrication of bipolar plates from these kinds of alloys could reduce weight of the stack and provide high mechanical stability. Due to an innovative hydroforming process, reducing manufacturing costs will be possible (1). Test results of the linear sweep voltammetry show that bipolar plates fabricated from standard V 2 A or V 4 A steel can withstand the <b>corrosive</b> <b>conditions</b> in a low-temperature (50 °C) proton exchange membrane fuel cell. These alloys show little corrosion rates over a wide potential range.

40|$|Corrosion, the {{environmentally}} induced {{degradation of}} materials, {{has been a}} challenging and costly problem that has affected NASA's launch operations {{since the inception of}} the Space Program. Corrosion studies began at NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in 1966 during the Gemini/Apollo Programs with the evaluation of long-term protective coatings for the atmospheric protection of carbon steel. NASA's KSC Beachside Corrosion Test Site, which has been documented by the American Society of Materials (ASM) {{as one of the most}} corrosive, naturally occurring environments in the world, was established at that time. With the introduction of the Space Shuttle in 1981, the already highly <b>corrosive</b> natural <b>conditions</b> at the launch pad were rendered even more severe by the acidic exhaust from the solid rocket boosters. In the years that followed, numerous efforts at KSC identified materials, coatings, and maintenance procedures for launch hardware and equipment exposed to the highly corrosiye environment at the launch pads. Knowledge on materials degradation, obtained by facing the highly <b>corrosive</b> <b>conditions</b> of the Space Shuttle launch environment, as well as limitations imposed by the environmental impact of corrosion control, have led researchers at NASA's Corrosion Technology Laboratory to establish a new technology development capability in the area of corrosion prevention, detection, and mitigation at KSC that is included as one of the "highest priority" technologies identified by NASA's integrated technology roadmap.
