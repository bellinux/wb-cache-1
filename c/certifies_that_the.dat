The objective is to extend water and sewer connections to 11.300 households in poor, unzoned, periurban neighbourhoods. The pilot projects are part of the National Human Development Initiative and are funded through a US$ 7 million grant by the Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) administered by the World Bank. It {{is the first time that}} GPOBA, which promotes primarily the private sector, provided grants to a public water operator. The average subsidy level per connection amounts to USD 169 for water supply and to USD 606 for sanitation. The average subsidy level per connection is 35 percent. Operators also developed awareness raising campaigns to make people aware of the option to connect to sewers through teams that go to market places. Under the output-based aid approach investments are pre-financed by the concessionaires or the public utility that are being reimbursed by GPOBA only after a verification process <b>certifies</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> households have been connected and receive an adequate service. According to the World Bank, the output-based aid approach has helped to improve processes, overcome financing obstacles and mobilize stakeholder partnership.|$|E
