2500|$|Every {{irreducible}} complex algebraic {{curve is}} birational to a unique smooth projective curve, so the theory for curves is trivial. The case of surfaces was first {{investigated by the}} geometers of the Italian school around 1900; the contraction theorem of Castelnuovo essentially describes the process of constructing a minimal model of any smooth surface. The theorem states that any nontrivial birational morphism f:Xrarr&Y must contract a minus&1-curve to a smooth point, and conversely any such curve can be smoothly contracted. Here [...] a minus&1-curve is a smooth rational curve C with self-intersection C.C = minus&1.
