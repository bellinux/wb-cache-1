5|$|Also in 1990, the U.S. {{intervened in}} the Middle East with Operation Desert Storm. During that intervention, Fort Lewis {{deployed}} 34 active and 25 reserve component units to Saudi Arabia. I <b>Corps</b> {{also contributed to}} the command structure, with the I <b>Corps</b> Commander, LTG Calvin A. H. Waller and the Deputy I <b>Corps</b> Commander, MG Paul R. Schwartz, assisting General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the Commander of the American Forces. I <b>Corps</b> expanded its contingency missions and became a quick-response <b>corps.</b> For several months, I <b>Corps</b> was the nation's worldwide contingency <b>corps,</b> while the XVIII Airborne <b>Corps</b> was engaged in the Gulf War. This caused a good deal of activity on Fort Lewis, as the post restructured itself to support the corps' new mission, and to insure that it had a smooth, rapid departure in case they were needed anywhere in the world. This duty was returned to XVIII Airborne <b>Corps</b> upon its return to the United States. The <b>corps</b> then began to convert to a permanently structured, no-mobilization contingency <b>corps</b> and was placed under the operational control of the United States Army Forces Command. This entailed the addition of a number of active component <b>corps</b> units.|$|E
5|$|As I <b>Corps</b> troops {{approached}} the Iron Triangle {{formed by the}} cities of Chorwon, Kumhwa, and Pyongyang, Chinese resistance increased. By that time, the 1st South Korean Infantry Division was relieved from the <b>corps</b> and {{assigned to one of}} the Korean <b>corps.</b> The 1st Cavalry Division was returned to the <b>corps</b> in its place.|$|E
5|$|By December 22, 1950, the US Eighth Army's front had {{stabilized}} {{along the}} 38th parallel. Just {{days before his}} death, Walker placed the US I <b>Corps,</b> the US IX <b>Corps,</b> and the ROK III <b>Corps</b> of the Eighth Army along the 38th parallel to defend Seoul. The US I and IX <b>Corps</b> were to defend the Imjin and Hantan River respectively, while the ROK III <b>Corps</b> were to guard the areas around Chuncheon. The boundary between US I and IX <b>Corps</b> was marked by Route 33, and was defended by the ROK 1st Infantry Division {{on the west side}} and the ROK 6th Infantry Division on the east side.|$|E

5|$|Currie's Canadian <b>Corps</b> was the {{principal}} attacking formation. Immediately to the north, the Canadians were supported by XVIII <b>Corps</b> and after an inter-army boundary shift, II <b>Corps</b> of the Second Army. To the extreme north, the advance was supported by diversionary attacks by the British XIV <b>Corps</b> and the 1st and 133rd Divisions of the French First Army. To the south, the right flank of the Canadian advance was supported by I Anzac <b>Corps.</b> Further south, X <b>Corps</b> supported the operation by attacking Gheluvelt to secure Tower Hamlets ridge, east of the Bassevillebeek as a diversion.|$|E
5|$|During the Gallipoli campaign, Godley {{commanded}} the composite New Zealand and Australian Division, before taking over {{command of the}} Australian and New Zealand Army <b>Corps</b> for {{the final stages of}} the campaign. Promoted to lieutenant general, he had a brief period in command of I Anzac <b>Corps</b> before being given command of the II Anzac <b>Corps.</b> He led the <b>corps</b> for most of its service on the Western Front. Regarded as a cold and aloof commander, his popularity was further dented in October 1917 when he insisted on continuing an offensive in the Ypres salient when weather and ground conditions were not favourable. His <b>corps</b> suffered heavy losses in the ensuing battle. In 1918, II Anzac <b>Corps</b> was re-designated as British XXII <b>Corps</b> and he led it {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of defenses south of the capital city, General Matthew B. Ridgway ordered I, IX, and X <b>Corps</b> to conduct a general counteroffensive against the Chinese forces on 25 January, Operation Thunderbolt. The three <b>corps</b> advanced north with IX <b>Corps</b> {{at the center of}} the line, on both sides of the Han River. The <b>corps</b> were to advance steadily northward, protected by heavy artillery and close air support, until they captured Seoul. IX <b>Corps</b> was tasked with capturing Chipyong-ni, southeast of Seoul while providing support to the other two <b>corps.</b> However, it encountered stiff resistance from Chinese forces dug into the hilly country around Chipyong-ni and was still bogged down in combat by 2 February. Chinese forces had established machine gun nests in the hillside and mined roads to slow the corps' advance. In response, X <b>Corps</b> launched Operation Roundup, hoping to take pressure off of IX <b>Corps</b> and to force the Chinese to abandon Seoul.|$|E

In November 1917 the five Australian divisions of I and II ANZAC <b>Corps</b> merged to become the Australian <b>Corps,</b> while the British and New Zealand elements in each <b>corps</b> became the British XXII <b>Corps.</b> The Australian <b>Corps</b> was the largest <b>corps</b> fielded by the British Empire in France, providing just over 10 percent of the manning of the BEF. At its peak it numbered 109,881 men. <b>Corps</b> troops raised included the 13th Light Horse Regiment and three army artillery brigades. Each <b>corps</b> also included a cyclist battalion.|$|E

Soldiers of the <b>corps</b> trained for a year in preparation for the deployment, which began on 9 April 2009. I <b>Corps</b> filled the role of Multi-National <b>Corps</b> - Iraq at Al-Faw Palace. In January 2010, Multi-National <b>Corps</b> - Iraq integrated with Multi-National Forces - Iraq (MNF-I) and Multi-National Security Transition Command – Iraq (MNSTC-I) to form United States Forces - Iraq (USF-I).

The <b>corps</b> maintained a position around Chorwon, flanked to the west by I <b>Corps</b> and to the east by the South Korean II <b>Corps.</b> Though the South Korean II <b>Corps</b> saw a major attack against its lines in July 1953, IX <b>Corps</b> and its divisions only fought in limited engagements, usually with company-sized formations attacking or defending fortified positions against the Chinese {{until the end of the}} war. No major attacks against the <b>corps</b> were conducted through 1953, until the armistice was signed in July, ending the war.|$|E
