5|$|One central {{coenzyme}} is {{adenosine triphosphate}} (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells. This nucleotide {{is used to}} transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There {{is only a small}} amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between <b>catabolism</b> and anabolism. <b>Catabolism</b> breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.|$|E
5|$|In mammals, this {{metabolic}} pathway {{is important in}} beta oxidation of fatty acids and <b>catabolism</b> of amino acids and choline, as it accepts electrons from multiple acetyl-CoA dehydrogenases. In plants, ETF-Q oxidoreductase is also important in the metabolic responses that allow survival in extended periods of darkness.|$|E
5|$|Metabolism {{is usually}} {{divided into two}} categories: <b>catabolism,</b> the {{breaking}} down of organic matter for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate, by cellular respiration, and anabolism, the building up of components of cells such as proteins and nucleic acids. Usually, breaking down releases energy and building up consumes energy.|$|E
5|$|Though {{molybdenum}} forms compounds {{with various}} organic molecules, including carbohydrates and amino acids, it is transported throughout {{the human body}} as MoO42−. At least 50 molybdenum-containing enzymes were known by 2002, mostly in bacteria, and the number is increasing with every year; those enzymes include aldehyde oxidase, sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidase. In some animals, and in humans, the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid, a process of purine <b>catabolism,</b> is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, a molybdenum-containing enzyme. The activity of xanthine oxidase is directly proportional {{to the amount of}} molybdenum in the body. However, an extremely high concentration of molybdenum reverses the trend and can act as an inhibitor in both purine <b>catabolism</b> and other processes. Molybdenum concentration also affects protein synthesis, metabolism, and growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of cysts is induced {{by changes in}} the concentration of nutrients in the medium and addition of some organic substances such as ethanol, n-butanol, or β-hydroxybutyrate. Cysts are rarely formed in liquid media. The {{formation of}} cysts is induced by chemical factors and is accompanied by metabolic shifts, changes in <b>catabolism,</b> respiration, and biosynthesis of macromolecules; it is also affected by aldehyde dehydrogenase and the response regulator AlgR.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{important}} in <b>catabolism,</b> NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis. This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release {{only a small amount}} of energy. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly. As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH.|$|E
5|$|Anabolism is {{the set of}} {{constructive}} metabolic processes {{where the}} energy released by <b>catabolism</b> is used to synthesize complex molecules. In general, the complex molecules that make up cellular structures are constructed step-by-step from small and simple precursors. Anabolism involves three basic stages. First, the production of precursors such as amino acids, monosaccharides, isoprenoids and nucleotides, secondly, their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP, and thirdly, the assembly of these precursors into complex molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{discovery}} of post-translational circular permutations and {{the suggestion of}} a possible genetic mechanism for evolving circular permutants, it was not until 1995 that the first circularly permuted pair of genes were discovered. Saposins are a class of proteins involved in sphingolipid <b>catabolism</b> and antigen presentation of lipids in humans. Chris Ponting and Robert Russell identified a circularly permuted version of a saposin inserted into plant aspartic proteinase, which they nicknamed swaposin. Saposin and swaposin were the first known case of two natural genes related by a circular permutation.|$|E
5|$|Living organisms must {{obey the}} laws of thermodynamics, which {{describe}} the transfer of heat and work. The second law of thermodynamics states that in any closed system, the amount of entropy (disorder) cannot decrease. Although living organisms' amazing complexity appears to contradict this law, life is possible as all organisms are open systems that exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. Thus living systems are not in equilibrium, but instead are dissipative systems that maintain their state of high complexity by causing a larger increase in the entropy of their environments. The metabolism of a cell achieves this by coupling the spontaneous processes of <b>catabolism</b> to the non-spontaneous processes of anabolism. In thermodynamic terms, metabolism maintains order by creating disorder.|$|E
5|$|Some non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} are {{not found in}} proteins. Examples include 2-aminoisobutyric acid and the {{neurotransmitter}} gamma-aminobutyric acid. Non-proteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in the metabolic pathways for standard amino acids– for example, ornithine and citrulline occur in the urea cycle, part of amino acid <b>catabolism</b> (see below). A rare exception to the dominance of α-amino acids in biology is the β-amino acid beta alanine (3-aminopropanoic acid), which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), a component of coenzyme A.|$|E
5|$|APOA5 mainly {{functions}} to influence plasma triglyceride levels. The first suggested mechanism supposes that APOA5 functions as an activator of lipoprotein lipase (which {{is a key}} enzyme in triglyceride <b>catabolism)</b> and, through this process, enhances the metabolism of TG-rich particles. The second is the possible effect of APOA5 on the secretion of VLDL particles, since APOA5 reduces hepatic production by inhibiting VLDL-particle production and assembly by binding to cellular membranes and lipids. Finally, the third possibility relates to the acceleration of the hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants {{and it has been}} shown that APOA5 binds to different members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. In addition to its TG-lowering effect, APOA5 also plays a significant role in modulating HDL maturation and cholesterol metabolism. Increased APOA5 levels were associated with skewed cholesterol distribution from VLDL to large HDL particles. APOA5 mRNA is upregulated during liver regeneration and this suggests that APOA5 serves a function in hepatocyte proliferation. It’s also reported that APOA5 could enhance insulin secretion in beta-cells and the cell surface midkine could be involved in APOA5 endocytosis.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrate <b>catabolism</b> is the {{breakdown}} of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic (with oxygen) glycolysis and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|<b>Catabolism</b> is {{the set of}} {{metabolic}} {{processes that}} break down large molecules. These include breaking down and oxidizing food molecules. The purpose of the catabolic reactions is to provide the energy and components needed by anabolic reactions which build molecules. The exact nature of these catabolic reactions differ from organism to organism, and organisms can be classified based on their sources of energy and carbon (their primary nutritional groups), {{as shown in the}} table below. Organic molecules are used as a source of energy by organotrophs, while lithotrophs use inorganic substrates, and phototrophs capture sunlight as chemical energy. However, all these different forms of metabolism depend on redox reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor molecules such as organic molecules, water, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide or ferrous ions to acceptor molecules such as oxygen, nitrate or sulfate. In animals, these reactions involve complex organic molecules that are broken down to simpler molecules, such as carbon dioxide and water. In photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and cyanobacteria, these electron-transfer reactions do not release energy but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight.|$|E

25|$|Ammonia is {{produced}} by exercised skeletal muscles from ADP (the precursor of ATP) by purine nucleotide deamination and amino acid <b>catabolism</b> of myofibrils.|$|E
25|$|Beisel and Storz {{demonstrated}} with microarray {{analysis and}} reporter fusions that Spot 42 plays a broader role in metabolism by regulating at least 14 operons. These operons contain {{a number of}} genes involved in uptake and <b>catabolism</b> of non-favoured carbon sources. During overexpression of Spot 42 sixteen different genes show 2-fold elevated levels of mRNA. The identified genes are mostly involved in central and secondary metabolism, as well as uptake and <b>catabolism</b> of non-preferred carbon sources and oxidation of NADH.|$|E
25|$|<b>Catabolism</b> is the {{metabolic}} reaction which cells undergo to extract energy. There {{are two major}} metabolic pathways of monosaccharide catabolism: glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.|$|E
25|$|Biliverdin is a green tetrapyrrolic bile pigment, and is {{a product}} of heme <b>catabolism.</b> It is the pigment {{responsible}} for a greenish color sometimes seen in bruises.|$|E
25|$|Growth: {{maintenance}} of {{a higher rate of}} anabolism than <b>catabolism.</b> A growing organism increases in size in all of its parts, rather than simply accumulating matter.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} and sites of Lp(a) <b>catabolism</b> are largely unknown. Uptake via the LDL receptor {{is not a}} major pathway of Lp(a) metabolism. The kidney has been identified as playing a role in Lp(a) clearance from plasma.|$|E
25|$|Nutrition is {{the science}} that interprets the {{interaction}} of nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism. It includes food intake, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, <b>catabolism</b> and excretion.|$|E
25|$|Metabolism: {{transformation}} of energy by converting chemicals and energy into cellular components (anabolism) and decomposing organic matter (<b>catabolism).</b> Living things require energy to maintain internal organization (homeostasis) and {{to produce the}} other phenomena associated with life.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{is absorbed}} through breathing {{and enters the}} blood stream through gas exchange in the lungs. It is also produced in heme <b>catabolism</b> and enters the blood from the tissues, and thus is present in all normal tissues, even if not inhaled.|$|E
25|$|Approaches {{influencing}} {{several of}} these processes simultaneously have also shown to be successful, like transferring the combination of inhibitors of <b>catabolism</b> pathways and activators of anabolic events (IGF-I/IL-1RA), {{as well as that}} of activators of anabolic and proliferative processes (FGF- 2/SOX9 or FGF-2/IGF-I).|$|E
25|$|GA1 worsens during {{stresses}} and catabolic episodes, such as fasts and infections. Endogenous <b>catabolism</b> of proteins {{could be an}} important route for glutaric acid production. It thus follows that collagen breakdown (and protein breakdown in general) should be prevented by all possible means.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} of tryptophan to serotonin and other metabolites depends on vitamin B6. If tryptophan <b>catabolism</b> has {{any impact on}} brain glutaric acid and other catabolite levels, vitamin B6 levels should be routinely assayed and normalized {{in the course of}} the treatment of GA1.|$|E
25|$|In glycolysis, oligo/polysaccharides are cleaved {{first to}} smaller monosaccharides by enzymes called {{glycoside}} hydrolases. The monosaccharide units can then enter into monosaccharide <b>catabolism.</b> In some cases, as with humans, not all carbohydrate types are usable as the digestive and metabolic enzymes necessary are not present.|$|E
25|$|A {{protease}} (also {{called a}} peptidase or proteinase) is any enzyme that performs proteolysis; protein <b>catabolism</b> by hydrolysis of peptide bonds. Proteases have evolved multiple times, and different classes of protease can perform {{the same reaction}} by completely different catalytic mechanisms. Proteases {{can be found in}} Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Bacteria, Archaea and viruses.|$|E
25|$|Mercury irreversibly {{inhibits}} selenium-dependent enzymes (see below) and {{may also}} inactivate S-adenosyl-methionine, which is necessary for catecholamine <b>catabolism</b> by catechol-O-methyl transferase. Due to the body's inability to degrade catecholamines (e.g. epinephrine), a person suffering from mercury poisoning may experience profuse sweating, tachycardia (persistently faster-than-normal heart beat), increased salivation, and hypertension (high blood pressure).|$|E
25|$|The {{end-product}} of <b>catabolism</b> {{of protein}} metabolism in animals is nitrogen. Animals must excrete {{this in the}} form of nitrogenous compounds. Ostriches are uricotelic. They excrete nitrogen as the complex nitrogenous waste compound uric acid, and related derivatives. Uric acid's low solubility in water gives a semi-solid paste consistency to the ostrich's nitrogenous waste.|$|E
25|$|Ascorbic acid {{performs}} numerous {{physiological functions}} in the human body. These functions include the synthesis of collagen, carnitine, and neurotransmitters; the synthesis and <b>catabolism</b> of tyrosine; and the metabolism of microsome. During biosynthesis ascorbate acts as a reducing agent, donating electrons and preventing oxidation to keep iron and copper atoms in their reduced states.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its effects}} similar to nitric oxide (without its {{potential}} to form peroxides by interacting with superoxide), hydrogen sulfide is now recognized as potentially protecting against cardiovascular disease. The cardioprotective role effect of garlic is caused by <b>catabolism</b> of the polysulfide group in allicin to , a reaction that could depend on reduction mediated by glutathione.|$|E
25|$|From a {{biological}} standpoint, water has many distinct properties {{that are critical}} for the proliferation of life. It carries out this role by allowing organic compounds to react in ways that ultimately allow replication. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a solvent in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as {{an essential part of}} many metabolic processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and <b>catabolism.</b> In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g. starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In <b>catabolism,</b> water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.|$|E
25|$|In the duodenum, proteases digest R-proteins {{and release}} their bound B12, which then binds to IF, {{to form a}} complex (IF/B12). B12 must be {{attached}} to IF {{for it to be}} efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal ileum of the small bowel only recognize the B12-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from <b>catabolism</b> by intestinal bacteria.|$|E
25|$|As a {{doctoral}} student, Bernheim {{was aware of}} the limited research which had been conducted on the <b>catabolism</b> of tyramine, a naturally occurring monoamine compound obtained from the amino acid tyrosine.
