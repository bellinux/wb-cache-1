40|$|Low density plantings {{complemented by}} natural {{regeneration}} is an increasingly common reforestation technique to ensure {{growth of a}} sufficient number of trees from desired species while maintaining natural processes such as succession. One such form of low density planting that aims at lowering establishment costs—oak clusters—has been developed as an alternative to row planting since the 1980 s in central Europe. However, whether <b>cluster</b> <b>planting</b> provides higher species richness and productivity than high density row planting has not previously been analyzed. Here, we compare tree species richness and productivity (measured as stand basal area) between oak cluster plantings and conventional row planting in young (10 – 26 years old) forest stands at seven study sites in Germany. Tree species richness was significantly higher in cluster plantings than in row plantings, whereas total basal areas were comparable. Naturally regenerated trees contributed on average to 43 % of total stand basal area in cluster plantings, which was significantly higher than in row plantings. Total stand basal area in <b>cluster</b> <b>planting</b> was significantly related to the density of naturally regenerated trees. In turn, tree species diversity, density and basal area of naturally regenerated trees were increased with the size of unplanted area between clusters. Our results demonstrate that the admixture of naturally regenerated, early and mid-successional tree species compensates for a possible loss in productivity from planting fewer oaks. Low density cluster plantings can offer significant environmental benefits, at least for the first few decades of stand development, without compromising productivity...|$|E

40|$|International audience& Context <b>Cluster</b> <b>planting</b> {{has become}} a {{conventional}} estab-lishment method for oaks in Central Europe, where the spacing of seedlings within clusters varies between 'nests' (0. 2 × 0. 2 m) and 'groups' (1 × 1 m). Although the space between clusters is expected to fill with voluntary regeneration, its competitive effect on oak growth and quality had not been studied yet. & Aims The aim {{of the study was}} to analyse the effects of inter-and intraspecific interactions on growth and quality of oaks grown in cluster plantings by quantifying the influence of neighbouring trees. In addition, we analysed whether the spatial position of oaks within groups (inner section or pe-riphery) influenced their quality development. & Methods Using Hegyi's competition index, the influence of competition from intra-and interspecific trees from early, mid-and late-successional species, on diameter, height, slenderness and quality (length of branch-free bole) of 10 -to 26 -year-old oaks grown in <b>cluster</b> <b>planting</b> stands was quantified at seven sites in Baden-Württemberg and Hessen, Germany. & Results In general, mid-and late-successional trees exerted a stronger competitive influence on growth of target oaks in clusters than the conspecific oaks and pioneer tree species. Oak quality development benefited from intraspecific compe-tition, but self-pruning was not further promoted through additional interspecific competition. Within groups, inner oaks had a higher probability of developing into potential future crop trees than outer oaks. & Conclusion Our study showed that intra-and interspecific competition had different effects on target oak trees and that these effect differed between nest and group plantings. The development of naturally regenerated and planted trainer trees in group plantings should be monitored carefully and if nec-essary be controlled through thinning or pollarding...|$|E

They grow extensively in the five big islands (Jawa, Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Papua). At the year of 2009, Agency of Survey Coordination and National Mapping (Bakosurtanal) of Indonesia reported the existing mangrove forest area in Indonesia of about 3, 244, 018 ha, however Directorate General of Land Rehabilitation and Social Forestry, Ministry of Forestry (Ditjen RLPS MoF) of Indonesia at 2007 reported about 7, 758, 411 ha of mangrove area in Indonesia (including existing vegetated mangrove area). It was further reported that those mangroves were 30. 7 % in good condition, 27. 4 % moderate-destroyed, and 41. 9 % heavy-destroyed. In order to rehabilitate destroyed mangrove ecosystems, Indonesia applies at least three type of planting designs (square planting design, zig zag planting design, and <b>cluster</b> <b>planting</b> design) and eight planting techniques (“banjar harian” technique, bamboo pole technique, guludan technique, water break technique, huge polybag technique, ditch muddy technique, huge mole technique, cluster technique).

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of AgronomyScott A. Staggenborg and Alan J. SchlegelPrevious {{work in the}} High Plains with {{alternative}} planting geometries of corn and grain sorghum has shown potential benefits in dryland production. Studies conducted in 2009 - 2011 at Tribune, KS evaluated five planting geometries in corn and grain sorghum: conventional, clump, cluster, plant-one skip-one (P 1 S 1), and plant-two skip-two (P 2 S 2). Geometries were evaluated at three plant densities in corn: 3. 0, 4. 0, and 5. 1 plants m[superscript]- 2. Every measured corn production characteristic was affected by planting geometry, seeding rate, or an interaction {{in at least one}} of the years. Corn planted in a P 2 S 2 configuration produced the least above-ground biomass, kernels plant[superscript]- 1, kernels ear row[superscript]- 1, and the highest kernel weight. Conventionally planted corn minimized harvest index and maximized stover production. Alternative geometries produced similar harvest indices. Grain yield response to seeding rate varied by geometry and year. Responsiveness and contribution of yield components were affected by geometry. Yield and yield components, other than ears plant[superscript]- 1, were the least responsive to seeding rate in a cluster geometry. Clump planting consistently maximized kernels plant[superscript]- 1. Prolificacy was observed in the cluster treatment and barrenness in the skip-row treatments. Light interception at silking was highest for clump and conventional geometries and lowest for the skip-row treatments. Corn in a P 2 S 2 configuration did not fully extract available soil water. Conventionally planted corn had the lowest levels of soil water at tassel-silk indicating early-season use which potentially affected kernel set. In the lowest yielding year, grain water use efficiency was highest for clump and P 2 S 2. Across-years, grain yields were lower for corn planted in a P 2 S 2 geometry. Across-years corn yields were maximized when planted in clump at low or intermediate plant density, conventional and P 1 S 1 at low plant density, P 1 S 1 at high density, or cluster at any density. Planting grain sorghum in a P 1 S 1 or P 2 S 2 configuration reduced total biomass, grain yield, water use efficiency for grain production (WUEg), and water use efficiency for biomass production (WUEb) compared to conventional, clump, or cluster geometries at the yield levels observed in this study. Total water use was unaffected by planting geometry although cumulative water use at flower / grain fill was higher for conventional, clump, and cluster than for skip-row configurations. Sorghum planted in a conventional geometry was always in the highest grouping of grain yields. Grain yields from sorghum in either a cluster or clump geometry were each in the top yield grouping two of three years. When evaluated across-years, sorghum planted in a clump, cluster, or conventional geometry resulted in similar levels of above-ground biomass, grain yield, WUEg, and WUEb. Clump or <b>cluster</b> <b>planting</b> appear to have substantially less downside in a high yielding year than skip-row configurations. 	A comparison of corn and sorghum reinforced the findings of others that the relative profitability of the crops is largely dependent on the environment for any given crop year. Relative differences in grain yield, WUEg, WUEb, and net returns varied by year. Net returns over the three year study were maximized by conventional, cluster, and clump planted sorghum as well as clump planted corn...|$|E

Across 29 communities, pollinators visited weakly phylogenetically <b>clustered</b> <b>plant</b> species.

However, these patterns were not explained by a simple dichotomous scoring of plants as restrictive or unrestrictive to unversatile pollinators. Collectively, these results suggest that constraints imposed by plant phylogeny on pollination networks are moderated by current ecological processes such as community assembly and pollinator foraging behaviour, but mechanisms are unclear. Future research should consider the opportunity for bidirectional interplay between ecological and phylogenetic effects...|$|R
