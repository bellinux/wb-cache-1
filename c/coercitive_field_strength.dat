40|$|High {{electric}} <b>field</b> <b>strengths</b> at {{the edge}} of the metallization of insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) power modules are, besides defects in the substrate or the potting gel, the main reason for partial discharge. These critical electric <b>field</b> <b>strengths</b> occur at the energized contact where it is bordered by the insulating ceramic and the cover (mostly silicone gel). The reduction of high electric <b>field</b> <b>strengths</b> for increasing the threshold voltage for partial discharge has been studied in several publications based on experiments as well as on simulations. Simulations allow the localization of the critical spots and the quantification of the maximum electric <b>field</b> <b>strength.</b> However, a systematic study of the singularities of the electric <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> at the sharp edges is lacking. Such singularities are investigated in this article. The calculation of an absolute electric <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> value is only possible for finite edge radii. For sharp edges, however, the maximum electric <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> returned by simulation depends on the grid size: Through the finite grid size a virtual edge radius is induced that suppresses the singularity {{at the edge}}.
