5000|$|Wood gasifiers can power either spark {{ignition}} engines, where 100% {{of the normal}} fuel can be replaced with little change to the carburation, or in a Diesel engine, feeding the gas into the air inlet that is modified to have a throttle valve, if it didn't have it already. On Diesel engines the Diesel fuel is still needed to ignite the gas mixture, so a mechanically regulated Diesel engine's [...] "stop" [...] linkage and probably [...] "throttle" [...] linkage must be modified to always give the engine {{a little bit of}} injected fuel, often under the standard idle per-injection volume. Wood can be used to power cars with ordinary internal combustion engines if a wood gasifier is attached. This was quite popular during World War II in several European, African and Asian countries, because the war prevented easy and cost-effective access to oil. In more recent times, wood gas has been suggested as a clean and efficient method to heat and cook in developing countries, or even to produce electricity when combined with an internal combustion engine. Compared to World War II technology, gasifiers have become less dependent on constant attention due to the use of sophisticated electronic control systems, but it remains difficult to get <b>clean</b> <b>gas</b> from them.

50|$|Aerosol Jet Printing (also {{known as}} Maskless Mesoscale Materials Deposition or M3D) is another {{material}} deposition technology for printed electronics. The Aerosol Jet process begins with atomization of an ink, {{which can be}} heated up to 80 °C, producing droplets {{on the order of}} one to two micrometres in diameter. The atomized droplets are entrained in a gas stream and delivered to the print head. Here, an annular flow of <b>clean</b> <b>gas</b> is introduced around the aerosol stream to focus the droplets into a tightly collimated beam of material. The combined gas streams exit the print head through a converging nozzle that compresses the aerosol stream to a diameter as small as 10 µm. The jet of droplets exits the print head at high velocity (~50 meters/second) and impinges upon the substrate. Electrical interconnects, passive and active components are formed by moving the print head, equipped with a mechanical stop/start shutter, relative to the substrate. The resulting patterns can have features ranging from 10 µm wide, with layer thicknesses from tens of nanometers to >10 µm. A wide nozzle print head enables efficient patterning of millimeter size electronic features and surface coating applications. All printing occurs without the use of vacuum or pressure chambers and at room temperature. The high exit velocity of the jet enables a relatively large separation between the print head and the substrate, typically 2-5 mm. The droplets remain tightly focused over this distance, resulting in the ability to print conformal patterns over three dimensional substrates. Despite the high velocity, the printing process is gentle; substrate damage does not occur and there is generally no splatter or overspray from the droplets. Once patterning is complete, the printed ink typically requires post treatment to attain final electrical and mechanical properties. Post-treatment is driven more by the specific ink and substrate combination than by the printing process. A wide range of materials has been successfully deposited with the Aerosol Jet process, including diluted thick film pastes, thermosetting polymers such as UV-curable epoxies, and solvent-based polymers like polyurethane and polyimide, and biologic materials.|$|E

The EU goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80 - 95 % below 1990 levels by 2050 will impose large changes is the used space heating technology of households. The energy demand mix for space heating in the built environment will therefore change. An agent based model has been created to model the behaviour of home owners and their decision for a space heating technology. It was assumed that a space heating energy demand mix with electricity as dominant energy carrier will impose great challenges on the grid with large costs, costs that exponentially enlarge with higher demand from relatively low prices now. <b>Clean</b> <b>gas,</b> an overarching term for biogas, a mix of hydrogen and other CO 2 neutral gasses, distributed via the existing natural gas network, could lower the overall system cost for space heating as <b>clean</b> <b>gas</b> costs are assumed to go exponentially down from a high start price now.
