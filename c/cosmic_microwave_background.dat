5|$|Although {{a distant}} planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little light, {{it would still}} be {{radiating}} the heat from its formation as it cools due to its large mass.

5|$|In modern cosmological theory, {{diffusion}} damping, {{also called}} photon diffusion damping, {{is a physical}} process which reduced density inequalities (anisotropies) in the early universe, making the universe itself and the <b>cosmic</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> radiation (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years after the Big Bang, during the epoch of recombination, diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with baryon acoustic oscillations, the Doppler effect, {{and the effects of}} gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a damping by diffusion, not of diffusion.|$|E

40|$|The South Pole Telescope (SPT), Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) {{have each}} {{reported}} {{measurements of the}} <b>cosmic</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>background's</b> (CMB) angular power spectrum which favor the existence of roughly one additional neutrino species, {{in addition to the}} three contained in the standard model of particle physics. Neutrinos influence the CMB by contributing to the radiation density, which alters the expansion rate of the universe during the epoch leading up to recombination. In this paper, we consider an alternative possibility that the excess kinetic energy implied by these measurements was possessed by dark matter particles that were produced through a non-thermal mechanism, such as late-time decays. In particular, we find that if a small fraction (< 1 %) of the dark matter in the universe today were produced through the decays of a heavy and relatively long-lived state, the expansion history of the universe can be indistinguishable from that predicted in the standard cosmological model with an additional neutrino. Furthermore, if these decays take place after the completion of big bang nucleosynthesis, this scenario can avoid tension with the value of three neutrino species preferred by measurements of the light element abundances.

40|$|Vacuum {{energy is}} a simple model for dark energy driving an {{accelerated}} expansion of the universe. If the vacuum energy is inhomogeneous in spacetime then it must be interacting.

Different models for the interaction can lead to different behaviour (e. g., sound speed for dark energy perturbations) and hence could be distinguished by cosmological observations.

5|$|Astronomers {{calculate}} {{the age of}} the Universe by assuming that the Lambda-CDM model accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model. This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck. Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the <b>cosmic</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present. With the prior that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of {{the age of the}} Universe as of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{at a time}} {{known as}} recombination, {{electrons}} and nuclei formed stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation. With photons decoupled from matter, the Universe entered the matter-dominated era. Light from this era could travel freely, and it can still {{be seen in the}} Universe as the <b>cosmic</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> (CMB). After around 100 million years, the first stars formed; these were likely very massive, luminous, and responsible for the reionization of the Universe. Having no elements heavier than lithium, these stars also produced the first heavy elements through stellar nucleosynthesis. The Universe also contains a mysterious energy called dark energy, the density of which does not change over time. After about 9.8 billion years, the Universe had expanded sufficiently so that the density of matter was less than the density of dark energy, marking the beginning of the present dark-energy-dominated era. In this era, the expansion of the Universe is accelerating due to dark energy.|$|E
5|$|Since Georges Lemaître first {{noted in}} 1927 that an {{expanding}} universe could {{be traced back}} in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories, the Big Bang and the Steady State theory, but a wide range of empirical evidence has strongly favored the Big Bang which is now universally accepted. In 1929, from analysis of galactic redshifts, Edwin Hubble concluded that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding universe. In 1964, the <b>cosmic</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> radiation was discovered, which was crucial evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was discovered. More recently, measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that {{the expansion of the universe}} is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence. The known physical laws of nature can be used to calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail {{back in time to}} an initial state of extreme density and temperature.|$|E
40|$|Primordial {{black holes}} (PBHs) are {{theoretical}} black holes {{which may be}} formed during the radiation dominant era and, basically, caused by the gravitational collapse of radiational overdensities. It has been well known that {{in the context of}} the structure formation in our Universe such collapsed objects, e. g., halos/galaxies, could be considered as bias tracers of underlying matter fluctuations and the halo/galaxy bias has been studied well. Employing a peak-background split picture which is known to be a useful tool to discuss the halo bias, we consider the large scale clustering behavior of the PBH and propose an almost mass-independent constraint to the scenario that dark matters (DMs) consist of PBHs. We consider the case where the statistics of the primordial curvature perturbations is almost Gaussian, but with small local-type non-Gaussianity. If PBHs account for the DM abundance, such a large scale clustering of PBHs behaves as nothing but the matter isocurvature perturbation and constrained strictly by the observations of <b>cosmic</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>backgrounds</b> (CMB). From this constraint, we show that, in the case a certain single field causes both CMB temperature perturbations and PBH formations, the PBH-DM scenario is excluded even with quite small local-type non-Gaussianity, |f_NL|∼O(0. 01), while we give the constraints to parameters in the case where the source field of PBHs is different from CMB perturbations.

40|$|Much {{attention}} has been drawn to the recent discoveries by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) of merging intermediate mass black holes. Of particular interest {{is the possibility that}} the merger events detected could be evidence of dark matter in the form of primordial black holes (PBHs). It has been argued that the presence of many black holes would effect the thermal and ionization history of the universe via their accretion of matter which would have strong signatures in the <b>Cosmic</b> <b>Microwave</b> <b>Background's</b> (CMB) power spectra evident in the damping of anisotropies and change in low-l polarization power. In general the accretion is quite sensitive to the specific physics involved and the conditions of the early universe. In this work, we take a minimal approach and find constraints on PBHs not including the model dependent effects of nonlinear structure of formation or transition between different accretion models which would work to increase the effect. In addition, we include the relative velocity between dark matter and baryonic matter including the effects of supersonic streaming at high redshift which work to significantly reduce the constraining power. We also examine the constraints on more astrophysically-motivated extended black hole mass functions and discuss how mergers might effect this distribution. We find constraints on PBHs in the range ≈ 30 M_, finding that they could not compose more than 10 % of the total dark matter content. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
5|$|The Big Bang {{theory is}} the {{prevailing}} cosmological {{model for the}} universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for {{a broad range of}} phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the <b>cosmic</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>background</b> (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated with the Big Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe. After the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity in halos of dark matter, eventually forming the stars and galaxies visible today.|$|E

40|$|For a deconfining thermal SU(2) Yang-Mills plasma {{we discuss}} the role of (anti) calorons in {{introducing}} non-thermal behavior effectively {{described in terms of}} Planck's quantum of action ħ. This non-thermality cancels exactly between the ground-state estimate and its free quasiparticle excitations. Kinematic constraints in 4 -vertex scattering and the counting of radial loop variables versus the number of independent constraints on them are re-visited. Next, we consider thermal 2 → 2 one-loop scattering of the modes remaining massless upon the (anti) caloron induced adjoint Higgs mechanism (thermal ground state after spatial coarse graining). Starting with stringent analytical arguments, we are able to exclude the contribution to photon-photon scattering from diagrams containing at least one three-vertex and, in a next step, a vast majority of all possible configurations involving two four-vertices. By numerical analysis we show that the remaining contribution of the overall S channel is severely suppressed compared to that of the T and U channels, meaning that the creation of a pair of massive vector modes by a pair of photons and vice versa practically does not occur in the Yang-Mills plasma. For the T and U channels the domain of loop integration represents less than 10 ^- 7 times the volume of the unconstrained integration region. The thus introduced photon-photon correlation should affect the <b>Cosmic</b> <b>Microwave</b> <b>Background's</b> polarisation at low redshift.
