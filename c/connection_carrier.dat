Skywest served the airport {{for many years}} and began flights to Santa Maria in 1984 when it acquired Sun Aire Lines. [...] SkyWest then began flying as a Delta <b>Connection</b> <b>carrier</b> from SMX during the late 1980s via a code sharing agreement with Delta Air Lines operating Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners before becoming a United Express carrier. [...] SkyWest had previously operated United Express service nonstop to Los Angeles with Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia propjets; however, flights to LAX were discontinued in favor of nonstop Canadair regional jet service to SFO for United. [...] SkyWest {{operating as}} United Express has since ceased all flights on the Santa Maria - San Francisco route and no longer serves the airport. [...] Mokulele Airlines subsequently replaced the SkyWest/United Express service to Los Angeles (LAX) and currently operates Cessna 208 Caravan commuter turboprop aircraft on the route.|$|E

25|$|Terminal E is {{distinctive}} {{in that it}} has {{a satellite}} terminal connected by an underground walkway. The satellite, which had been used by Delta and later used by Delta <b>Connection</b> <b>carriers,</b> was closed when Delta closed their DFW hub in 2005. It was briefly used in 2009 to house federal workers who evacuated New Orleans International Airport during Hurricane Gustav. It was refurbished and reopened in 2013 to house US Airways and Spirit Airlines while Terminal E was renovated. In October 2014, Delta and Alaska Airlines used the E satellite terminal, following the renovation project of gates E31–E38.|$|R
50|$|Most recently, in 2005, Delta <b>Connection</b> <b>carrier</b> Atlantic Southeast Airlines {{operated}} Bombardier CRJ200 Regional Jets {{on their}} direct service to Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, before ceasing this {{service in the}} fall of the year.|$|E
5000|$|SkyWest Airlines began serving Elko as an {{independent}} commuter carrier during the early 1980s, flying Swearingen Metros to Reno, Salt Lake City and Ely. By the late 1980s SkyWest was serving the airport as Western Express for Western Airlines via code sharing agreement with flights mainly to Salt Lake City on Metros. [...] Following the merger of Western into Delta Air Lines, SkyWest became a Delta <b>Connection</b> <b>carrier</b> via a code sharing agreement and in 1989 was flying Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias to Salt Lake City in addition to Metro service. [...] SkyWest continues to serve the airport as a Delta <b>Connection</b> <b>carrier,</b> the only airline serving Elko.|$|E
50|$|The airline was {{established}} and started operations on December 15, 1989, {{and had been}} in a marketing agreement with United Airlines since its inception.

50|$|Business Express Airlines , often {{referred}} to as Business Express or BizEX, was an American regional airline founded as Atlantic Air in 1982. In an effort to appeal to its predominantly business commuter clientele, the airline assumed the Business Express name in 1985. In 1986 Pilgrim Airlines (Groton/New London), which itself had acquired NewAir (New Haven) about a year prior, was acquired by the airline. This opened the valuable New York and Washington, D.C. markets. Shortly thereafter, Business Express became one of Delta Air Lines's first Delta <b>Connection</b> <b>carriers,</b> along with Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Comair and SkyWest Airlines.|$|R
50|$|In early 2008 {{a typical}} day saw seven departures to Atlanta, GA on Bombardier CRJ-200 {{regional}} jets and ATR 72 turboprop aircraft by Delta <b>Connection</b> <b>carriers,</b> US Airways Express had seven departures to Charlotte, NC with turboprop Bombardier Dash 8-300s and Bombardier CRJ-200s. As of mid-2009, Delta Air Lines regional carrier Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA) no longer operates the ATR-72 turboprop aircraft, and all ExpressJet flights {{into and out of}} Augusta are 50-seat CRJ-200 regional jets. US Airways Express served the airport with Dash 8-300 turboprops and CRJ-200s. American Eagle ended flights to Augusta on January 31, 2012, but it returned to Augusta once parent airline, American Airlines, overtook US Airways Express' parent US Airways in 2015.|$|R
50|$|Terminal E is {{distinctive}} {{in that it}} has {{a satellite}} terminal connected by an underground walkway. The satellite, which had been used by Delta and later used by Delta <b>Connection</b> <b>carriers,</b> was closed when Delta closed their DFW hub in 2005. It was briefly used in 2009 to house federal workers who evacuated New Orleans International Airport during Hurricane Gustav. It was refurbished and reopened in 2013 to house US Airways and Spirit Airlines while Terminal E was renovated. Terminal E is connected to the other terminals by Skylink, but lacks a walkway to the other terminals. In October 2014, Delta and Alaska Airlines used the E satellite terminal, following the renovation project of gates E31-E38.|$|R
50|$|UCA had no airline service after Continental <b>Connection</b> <b>carrier</b> CommutAir left on June 30, 2002. In {{its final}} years UCA had been {{receiving}} its service though the EAS program; declining ridership led the required subsidy to breach the $200 per passenger statutory cap.|$|E
50|$|Delta <b>Connection</b> <b>carrier</b> Comair briefly linked MBS with Cincinnati, Ohio using Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, a 30-seat turboprop.

5000|$|GP Express Airlines of Grand Island, Nebraska also {{operated}} as a Continental <b>Connection</b> <b>carrier</b> at Denver and Kansas City from 1994 through 1996. Continental Airlines had discontinued its hub {{operation at}} Denver by this time. GP Express operated Beechcraft 1900C and Beechcraft 99 aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The OS can {{be updated}} without docking to a PC, instead {{receiving}} OS updates over the <b>carrier</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Pinnacle Airlines had {{operated}} {{some with}} 44 seats, designated as CRJ440, with closets {{in the forward}} areas of the passenger cabin though these were converted to 50 seat airplanes. These modifications were designed to allow operations under their major airline contract [...] "scope clause" [...] which restricted major airlines' <b>connection</b> <b>carriers</b> from operating equipment carrying 50 or more passengers to guard against usurpation of Air Line Pilots Association and Allied Pilots Association pilots' union contract; these scope clauses have been since relaxed when union contracts were re-written between unions and the three remaining U.S. legacy carriers. Similarly, Comair's fleet of 40-seat CRJ200s were sold at a discounted price to discourage Comair from purchasing the less expensive and smaller Embraer 135.|$|R
50|$|When Delta {{went into}} {{bankruptcy}} in September 2005, a large reduction at CVG eliminated most early-morning and night flights. These initial cuts caused additional routes to become unprofitable, causing {{the frequency of}} low-volume routes to be further cut from 2006 to 2007. Planning for the new east/west runway stopped, along with all expansions to current terminals and Terminal 1 was closed {{due to lack of}} service. In 2008, Delta merged with Northwest Airlines and cut flight capacity from the Cincinnati hub by 22 percent with an additional 17 percent reduction in 2009. Once Delta acquired Northwest, Comair's older fleet, which was costly as a result of rising oil prices, was cut and replaced with other Delta <b>Connection</b> <b>carriers.</b> In 2010, Delta stabilized CVG operations with 63 destinations between mainline and connection flights.|$|R
5000|$|Southeastern Airlines was a {{regional}} airline that {{was acquired by}} Atlantic Southeast Airlines, a Delta <b>Connection</b> <b>carrier,</b> on April 1, 1983. [...] It was formed in 1982 by Atlanta entrepreneur Michael J. Brady, who had formerly been head of Eastern Metro Express, a feeder for Eastern Airlines.|$|E
50|$|The airline {{expanded}} into upstate New York in early 2008, following the sudden demise of Delta <b>Connection</b> <b>carrier</b> Big Sky Airlines. Cape Air began flying three daily round-trips on Essential Air Service routes from Boston to the Adirondack cities of Plattsburgh and Saranac Lake on February 12, 2008.|$|E
50|$|On December 21, 2006, a {{press release}} {{announced}} that Big Sky would become a Delta <b>Connection</b> <b>carrier</b> via a code share agreement with Delta Air Lines using eight Beechcraft 1900D turboprops operated from Boston's Logan International Airport (BOS). The airline's east coast operations ended on January 7, 2008.|$|E
50|$|The T320 has a total {{throughput}} of 320G bit/s (bits per second, 160G bit/s full duplex), {{compared with}} the bigger version T640's 640G bit/s (320 Gbit/s full duplex). T320 Core Router is designed for use where rack space is at a premium and {{a wide range of}} interface speeds are needed. Each T320 router can support up to sixteen 10-Gbit/s ports (OC-192c/ STM-64 or 10-Gigabit Ethernet) while allowing lower speed connectivity down to channelized increments within the same chassis. Befitting its edge aggregation role, the T320 also can accommodate smaller interfaces. Those include ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and SONet (Synchronous Optical Network) interfaces at OC-3 (155M bit/s) and OC-12 (622M bit/s), as well as Gigabit Ethernet. For those <b>connections,</b> <b>carriers</b> can reuse interfaces from the M series and install them in the T series blades.|$|R
5000|$|Business/Datacenter Internet <b>connections</b> and <b>carrier</b> up {{links with}} {{speeds up to}} 100Gbit/s as well as {{wavelength}} and dark fiber services for data transport in and between cities are available as well, with the main connection point being Vienna, where most carriers have one or more POPs in their own or carrier neutral datacenters.|$|R
50|$|An {{edge device}} is a device which {{provides}} an entry point into enterprise or service provider core networks. Examples include routers, routing switches, integrated access devices (IADs), multiplexers, {{and a variety}} of metropolitan area network (MAN) and wide area network (WAN) access devices. Edge devices also provide <b>connections</b> into <b>carrier</b> and service provider networks.|$|R
