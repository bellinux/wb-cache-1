Because of this, Prvić is considered the windiest Croatian island. Although the island is uninhabited, it is frequently used by shepherds for pasture and by local beekeepers who keep apiaries on the island.

50|$|Thujone {{is found}} {{in a number of}} plants, such as arborvitae (genus Thuja, hence the {{derivation}} of the name), Nootka cypress, some junipers, mugwort, oregano, <b>common</b> <b>sage,</b> tansy, and wormwood, most notably grand wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), usually as a mix of isomers in a 1:2 ratio. It is also found in various species of Mentha (mint).|$|E
50|$|From (+)-sabinene (8), the {{proposed}} biosynthetic route to generate thujone follows a three-step pathway: (+)-sabinene is first oxidized to an isomer of (+)-sabinol (9-1,2) by a cytochrome P450 enzyme, followed by conversion to (+)-sabinone (10) via a dehydrogenase. Finally, a reductase mediates the conversion to α-thujone (11-1) and β-thujone (11-2). The isomerism of the (+)-sabinol intermediate varies among thujone-producing plants; for instance, {{in the western}} redcedar (Thuja plicata), thujone is derived exclusively from the (+)-trans-sabinol intermediate (9-1) whereas in the <b>common</b> garden <b>sage</b> (Salvia officinalis), thujone is formed from the (+)-cis-sabinol intermediate (9-2).|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} whether the addition of different herbal oils (anise, sweet basil, blue chamomile, clove, true cinnamon, <b>common</b> <b>sage)</b> into whey will extend its shelf life. Changes in pH, titration acidity and microbiological analysis of whey during storage life were chosen as parameters for monitoring of whey shelf life. Based on these analyses possibility of utilization of herbal oils has been confirmed for the purpose of extension of the lifetime of whey. The use of essential oils blue chamomile and <b>common</b> <b>sage</b> did not help to extend the shelf life of fresh whey. The treatment of whey by herbal essential oils anise, sweet basil, clove and cinnamon extend the shelf life up to 21 days without significant changes in pH and titratable acidity. The results of our study show that essential oils could be used to inhibit microbial spoilage whey and to prolong its shelf life...|$|E

Group 5, OVX rats daily received both herb mixture and CaCO 3. The results showed significant decrease in serum calcium (Ca), inorganic phosphorus (P), total proteins (TP), calcitonin, bone mass density (BMD), reduced glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT) in OVX rats compared to the control group. While {{a significant increase in}} serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and acid phosphatase (ACP) were recorded. Also the recorded data showed increases in femur, tibia and vertebral lipid peroxidation (MAD) content and the activities of acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase in the ovariectomized rats. On the other hand, when OVX rats were fed on sage, rosemary and thyme supplemented diets or CaCO 3 in a single or in combination, the data recorded a significant improvement in all the above mentioned parameters. Finally, {{the results of this study}} indicated that the combination of <b>common</b> herbs (<b>sage,</b> rosemary and thyme) with calcium carbonate, was more effective in reduction and prevention of osteoporosis in ovariectomized rats.

40|$|Rapid {{germination}} or flexible germination cues may be key {{traits that}} facilitate {{the invasion of}} exotic plant species in new environments. We investigated whether robustness or plasticity in response to environmental cues were more commonly exhibited by exotic than native species during germination, evidenced by (1) exhibiting consistently greater germination rate {{under a variety of}} conditions (robustness), or (2) increasing germination rate more strongly than native species in response to favorable conditions (plasticity). We conducted growth chamber germination trials of 12 native and 12 exotic species <b>common</b> to coastal <b>sage</b> scrub, a shrub-dominated Mediterranean-type ecosystem in California. Time to germination and percentage germination were recorded in response to variation in three environmental cues: temperature, day length, and soil moisture. Exotic species, especially annuals, displayed consistently higher germination percentages and more rapid germination than native species. Exotic germination percentages also responded more strongly when conditions were favorable (warm temperatures and high soil moisture), and germinated earlier than natives when conditions were indicative of typical growing season conditions in Mediterranean ecosystems (short day length and cool temperatures). Exotic species had more rapid and prolific germination across a variety of environmental cues and in response to increased resource availability compared with native species, indicating both germination plasticity and robustness. These traits may enable colonization of novel environments, particularly if they allow exotic species to establish earlier in the growing season than native species, setting the stage for seasonal priority effects...|$|R
