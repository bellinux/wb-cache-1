40|$|Sediments {{along the}} west beach of Lake Biwa were sampled and {{analyzed}} to investigatebeach processes which are associated with in sediment properties, especially in the region whereincident wave energy fluxes are weaker than those in usual <b>coastal</b> <b>beaches</b> <b>or</b> east beachesin the Lake. First, historical changes in the geometry of beaches are studied. Secondly, the incidentwave properties are hindcasted by the SMB method using wind data observed at Hikone for 32 years. In four river mouth delta areas, wave refraction and energy fluxes entered intobreaker zone were calculated to evaluate the rate of longshore sediment transport. Combinning sediment, beach topography and incoming wave properties, we discuss anatural law of beach processes in terms of sediment properties, and conclude that sedimentproperties are good indexes {{to find out the}} dominant direction of longshore sediment trans-port which governs long term beach processes...|$|R

50|$|Overwash is {{the flow}} of water and {{sediment}} over a <b>coastal</b> dune <b>or</b> <b>beach</b> crest during storm events (or other sitations with high water). 'Overwash' may refer only to the landward flux of water due to overtopping of a dune system while 'washover' may refer to the sediment deposited by overwash. A common process on barrier islands, Overwash redistributes sediment and facilitates the migration of barrier islands in response to sea level rise. Overwash can occur as a result of runup (the maximum height of the swash), or inundation.|$|R

40|$|Habitats and {{geographic}} distribution were investigated for diploid and triploid L. lancifolium grown in islands and mainland areas covering a whole country of South Korea. Of 367 populations investigated, 185 (50. 4 %) and 182 (49. 6 %), respectively, were diploid and triploid populations. Diploid was intensively distributed only along western to southeastern coastal areas and islands, whereas triploid spread dominantly in inland {{areas of the}} Korean Peninsula. Diploid was specific to such seaside habitats as <b>coastal</b> cliffs <b>or</b> <b>beaches</b> but never to inland habitats. Triploid tended to prefer often-disturbed inland habitats such as roadsides, arable lands, hilly fields and riversides, though 23 % of triploid individuals were growing in the coastal cliffs. The facts indicate that adaptability for disturbed habitats are crucial for the distribution range of each cytotype. Nonetheless, triploids were rarely found in coastal habitats within the diploid distribution range. Autotriploid formation from diploid ancestors under natural conditions may be suppressed by rareness of higher unreduced gamete productivity within the diploid species and/or by minority cytotype exclusio...|$|R
