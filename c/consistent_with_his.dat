5|$|Letcher {{supported}} Adams' administration, {{but became}} anti-administration when Jackson won the 1828 presidential contest. <b>Consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> support of Clay, he promoted expansion of internal improvements, including the Maysville Road bill vetoed by Jackson. In 1833, Clay proposed a compromise in the Senate {{to quell the}} Nullification Crisis; Letcher introduced Clay's compromise in the House.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Æthelberht was converted to Christianity before Augustine's arrival. Æthelberht's wife was a Christian and brought a Frankish bishop with her, to attend her at court, so Æthelberht would have had knowledge of Christianity before the mission reached Kent. It also {{is possible}} that Bede had the date of Æthelberht's death wrong; if, in fact, Æthelberht died in 618, this would be <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> baptism in 597, which is {{in accord with the}} tradition that Augustine converted the king within a year of his arrival.|$|E
25|$|A bowling all-rounder, Andre Adams added a {{touch of}} dash to New Zealand's batting armoury in the one day format <b>with</b> <b>his</b> hard-hitting skills.

5|$|On June 30, Goldwater {{received}} {{the endorsement of}} moderate Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois after traveling to the Midwest to gain delegates. Dirksen's support further deflated the Stop Goldwater movement, as the Senator had criticized Goldwater's earlier vote against the Civil Rights Act, but concluded upon further review {{that he was only}} being <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> views. Richard Nixon followed suit and endorsed Goldwater two days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{arguments}} {{made in the}} Resolutions and the Report {{were later}} used frequently during the nullification crisis of 1832, when South Carolina declared federal tariffs to be unconstitutional and void within the state. Madison rejected the concept of nullification {{and the notion that}} his arguments supported such a practice. Whether Madison's theory of Republicanism really supported the nullification movement, and more broadly whether the ideas he expressed between 1798 and 1800 are <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> work before and after this period, are the main questions surrounding the Report in the modern literature.|$|E
5|$|During the 1987–88 season, Sampson (who was {{struggling}} with knee injuries that would eventually end his career prematurely) {{was traded to the}} Golden State Warriors. The 1988–89 season was Olajuwon's first full season as the Rockets' undisputed leader. This change also coincided with the hiring of new coach Don Chaney. The Rockets ended the regular season with a record of 45–37, and Olajuwon finished the season as the league leader in rebounds (13.5 per game) by a full rebound per game over Charles Barkley. This performance was <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> averages of 24.8 points and 3.4 blocks. Olajuwon posted exceptional playoff numbers of 37.5 ppg and 16.8 rpg, plus a record for points in a four-game playoff series (150). Nevertheless, the Rockets were eliminated in the first round by the Seattle SuperSonics, 3 games to 1.|$|E

50|$|As a {{literary}} theorist, he advocated the Insider Bungaku-ron (Theory of Literature by Insiders). <b>Consistent</b> <b>with</b> this theme, <b>his</b> novels frequently tackle {{the issues of}} problematic relations between individuals and the corporate or bureaucratic organizations to which they belong.|$|R
50|$|The Sun-Sentinel {{says that}} Tony Hillerman has {{attained}} {{a level of}} <b>consistent</b> excellence <b>with</b> <b>his</b> offbeat series of mysteries detailing the adventures of Officer John Chee and Lt.

5|$|For {{the first}} half of Letcher's term, the state was still {{struggling}} to recover from the financial Panic of 1837. <b>Consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> Whig views, Letcher blamed the crisis on the federal government's failure to recharter the Second Bank of the United States. To ameliorate the state's dire financial situation, Letcher drastically cut spending, including the suspension of turnpike construction and improvements on the Green, Kentucky, and Licking rivers. These actions greatly reduced the state's deficit and improved its credit. In each of Letcher's years in office, the state showed a small but growing budget surplus.|$|E
5|$|In November 1966 Life {{published}} {{a series of}} photographs from the film that Abraham Zapruder took of the Kennedy assassination. Alvarez, an expert in optics and photoanalysis, became intrigued by the pictures and began to study what could {{be learned from the}} film. Alvarez demonstrated both in theory and experiment that the backward snap of the President's head was fully <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> being shot from behind. He also investigated the timing of the gunshots and the shockwave which disturbed the camera, and the speed of the camera, pointing out a number of things which the FBI photoanalysts either overlooked or got wrong. He produced a paper intended as a tutorial, with informal advice for the physicist intent on arriving at the truth.|$|E
5|$|The {{first book}} starts {{on the topic}} of Greek {{philosophy}}. <b>Consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> other writing, Clement affirms that philosophy had a propaedeutic role for the Greek, similar to the function of the law for the Jews. He then embarks on a discussion of the origins of Greek culture and technology, arguing that most of the important figures in the Greek world were foreigners, and (erroneously) that Jewish culture was the most significant influence on Greece. In an attempt to demonstrate the primacy of Moses, Clement gives an extended chronology of the world, wherein he dates the birth of Christ to 25 April or May, 4-2 B.C., and the creation of the world to 5592 B.C. The books ends with a discussion on the origin of languages and the possibility of a Jewish influence on Plato.|$|E

2500|$|In a 1675 {{letter to}} Henry Oldenburg, {{and later to}} Robert Boyle, Newton wrote the following: [...] “a {{condensation}} causing a flow of ether with a corresponding thinning of the ether density associated with the increased velocity of flow.” He also asserted that such a process was <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> all <b>his</b> other work and Kepler's Laws of Motion. Newtons' idea of a pressure drop associated with increased velocity of flow was mathematically formalised as Bernoulli's principle published in Daniel Bernoulli's book Hydrodynamica in 1738.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} {{student of}} del Medigo's {{at that time}} was Domenico Grimani, a Venetian, who eventually became the Cardinal of San Marco.

5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> view of her. In particular, {{he said he did not}} believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, Gabriel Liebermann {{discovered}} that a scratch {{in the shape of}} a circular arc produces glints whose motion is approximately <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> binocular disparity. <b>His</b> 1980 artwork World Brain is made of CNC-machined semi-circular arcs that produce a holographic effect. The phenomenon was independently discovered in the 1990s by William Beaty who popularized a method of making hand-drawn holograms using a compass (drafting). This has come to be known as scratch holography.|$|R
40|$|Varicella-zoster is {{the virus}} that causes {{varicella}} (chicken pox), herpes zoster (shingles), and rarely, severe disseminated disease including diffuse rash, encephalitis, hepatitis, and pneumonitis. Disseminated disease is most often seen in immunocompromised patients. We describe a case of disseminated zoster in an immunocompentent patient who had previously been immune to VZV. This case is also unusual in that his clinical presentation was most <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> varicella while <b>his</b> laboratory data was most <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> herpes zoster. For the purpose of rapid diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy, clinicians should be aware of these more atypical presentations of VZV infection...|$|R
25|$|Throughout his {{retelling of}} history, Fulgentius adds moral interpretations of events. He goes {{to great lengths}} to justify God’s ways, and, <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> past works, {{stretches}} allegories to fit his ethical interpretations.|$|E
25|$|His {{compositions}} and improvisations feature dissonances and angular melodic {{twists and}} are <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> unorthodox {{approach to the}} piano, which combined a highly percussive attack with abrupt, dramatic use of switched key releases, silences, and hesitations.|$|E

40|$|Mucormycosis {{is a rare}} {{opportunistic}} fungal infection. Rhinocerebral form of {{the disease}} mainly affects diabetic or immunocompromised patients. Mucormycosis have specific tropism for blood vessels leading to mucorthrombosis and less often to mycotic aneurysms. We report on a patient initially presenting with a severe sphenoid sinusopathy, who progressively evolved to cavernous sinus syndrome, internal carotid aneurysm followed by spontaneous thrombosis, chronic meningitis and ultimately fatal hypertensive hydrocephalus. Necropsy revealed a purulent infiltrate containing thin-walled, aseptate, right-angle branching, hyphae <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> mucormycosis. <b>His</b> only relevant previous medical history was a transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary macroadenoma 21  years before. We hypothesize that post-surgical mucosal changes in the sphenoid sinus have been a favoring factor for delayed and invasive mucor infection...|$|R
5|$|Branham {{became more}} {{controversial}} {{in his later}} years and this was particularly evident in his development of a theology that emphasized a few select doctrines. His theology seemed complicated and bizarre to many people who admired him personally. Although not always <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> each other, <b>his</b> primary concerns were eschatology, the denial of an eternal hell, Oneness Pentecostalism, predestination, eternal security and the serpent's seed. Branham asserted that his doctrinal teachings were given to him by divine revelation.|$|R

Most published literature describes infants with kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, but a similar syndrome can complicate angiosarcoma in adults. This report describes a man with metastatic angiosarcoma arising in the scalp in whom disease progression was complicated by profound thrombocytopenia <b>consistent</b> <b>with</b> KMS. <b>His</b> disease and associated KMS had progressed previously through paclitaxel and then through liposomal doxorubicin.

50|$|Despite holding great {{positions}} of power, both Antony and Cleopatra are weakened by their overwhelming love for one another. Antony's ability {{to fulfill his}} military and political duties is hindered by <b>his</b> <b>consistent</b> emotional preoccupation <b>with</b> <b>his</b> love, Cleopatra. Cleopatra rejects offers of other kingdoms, prevents Egypt's growth, neglects her queenly duties, and throws her country into submission to the Romans all because of her infatuation with Antony.|$|R
