5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Iron Curtain and the {{economic}} and political barriers that followed, central and eastern European countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into exporters of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market. Exported porcini and other wild fungi are also destined for France, Germany and other western European markets, where demand for them exists, but collection on a commercial scale does not. Picking B.edulis has become an annual seasonal income earner and pastime in countries like Bulgaria, especially for many Roma <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> unemployed. A lack of control has led to heavy exploitation of the mushroom resource.|$|E
5|$|Overfishing is {{a serious}} threat to {{seamount}} ecological welfare. There are several well-documented cases of fishery exploitation, for example the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand and the pelagic armorhead (Pseudopentaceros richardsoni) near Japan and Russia. The {{reason for this is that}} the fishes that are targeted over seamounts are typically long-lived, slow-growing, and slow-maturing. The problem is confounded by the dangers of trawling, which damages seamount surface <b>communities,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fact that many seamounts are located in international waters, making proper monitoring difficult. Bottom trawling in particular is extremely devastating to seamount ecology, and is responsible for as much as 95% of ecological damage to seamounts.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> topic {{can help}} {{summarize}} the text-augmented social networks. Existing works mixed up <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> topic by regarding {{them as the}} same. However, there is an inherent difference between <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> topic such that considering them as the same is not so flexible. We propose a mutual enhanced infinite (MEI) community–topic model to detect <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> topics simultaneously in text-augmented social networks. <b>The</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> topic are correlated via a community–topic distribution. The mutual enhancement effect between <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> topic is validated by introducing two novel measures perplexity with <b>community</b> (perplexityc) <b>and</b> mean of <b>the</b> rank (MRK) with topic (MRKt). To determine <b>the</b> numbers of <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> topics automatically, <b>the</b> Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) model <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hierarchical Dirichlet Process mixture (HDP) model are used to model <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> topic, respectively. We further introduce parameters to model the weight of <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> topic responsible for community inference. Experiments on the co-author network built from a subset of DBLP data show that MEI outperforms the baseline models {{in terms of the}} generalization performance. Parameter study shows that MEI is averagely improved by 3. 7 and 15. 5 % in perplexityc and MRKt, respectively, by setting a low weight for the topic. We also experimentally validate that MEI can determine the appropriate numbers of <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> topics...|$|R

5|$|The Maya {{developed}} their first civilization in the Preclassic period. Scholars continue to discuss when {{this era of}} Maya civilization began. Maya occupation at Cuello (modern-day Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC. Settlements were established around 1800 BC in the Soconusco region of the Pacific coast, and the Maya were already cultivating the staple crops of maize, beans, squash, and chili pepper. This period was characterized by sedentary <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> introduction of pottery and fired clay figurines.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{the demise}} of wooden covered bridge would be seen, as a storm, dubbed the Pumpkin Flood of 1903, struck in October of that year. The storm struck both <b>communities,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bridge in between, causing the loss of many lives, and on October 17, the toll {{collector}} on the bridge closed off the gate and did not allow any person to cross. At 6:40 that evening, a crash was heard, and seconds later, the bridge was no more, after tumbling into the Delaware River below. Remnants of the bridge were swept downstream, and smashed {{on the side of}} the new Northampton Street Bridge, constructed just a few years before. After the storm cleared, the community of Belvidere put a ferry to Riverton back in almost immediately.|$|E
5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching <b>communities,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish conquest {{stripped}} away {{most of the}} defining features of Maya civilization. However, many Maya villages remained remote from Spanish colonial authority, {{and for the most}} part continued to manage their own affairs. Maya <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nuclear family maintained their traditional day-to-day life. The basic Mesoamerican diet of maize and beans continued, although agricultural output was improved by the introduction of steel tools. Traditional crafts such as weaving, ceramics, and basketry continued to be practised. Community markets and trade in local products continued long after the conquest. At times, the colonial administration encouraged the traditional economy in order to extract tribute in the form of ceramics or cotton textiles, although these were usually made to European specifications. Maya beliefs and language proved resistant to change, despite vigorous efforts by Catholic missionaries. The 260-day tzolk'in ritual calendar continues in use in modern Maya communities in the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas, and millions of Mayan-language speakers inhabit the territory in which their ancestors developed their civilization.|$|E
5|$|This event {{creating}} a sustainable and reliable {{relationship with the}} general public is {{a significant part of}} THSRC’s corporate vision and an important foundation of environmental and social sustainability. Therefore, it will continue making efforts to establish a good partnership with the general public {{as well as with the}} stakeholders, customers, employees, suppliers, <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government. To create greater value for each of these parties, it will move forward with its philosophy of “Go Extra Mile” to improve their lives through the provision of environmentally friendly high-speed rail services, which play a central role in connecting the entire western corridor of Taiwan. Since operation in 2007, THSRC has been dedicated to CSR initiatives, emphasizing environmental protection and giving support to all members of the communities served by THSRC. THSRC also published the first CSR Report in 2009, which gave all stakeholders a better understanding of its CSR objectives and activities, and in 2011, we received the 20th Annual Enterprises Environmental Protection Award, sponsored by the Environmental Protection Administration of Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 18th century, Welsh land owners {{divided up}} the land to allow for tenant-based farming. Each small holding would include {{vegetable}} crops, as well as a cow, pigs and a few chickens. The 18th and 19th centuries were a time of unrest for the Welsh people. The Welsh food riots began in 1740, when colliers blamed the lack of food on problems in the supply, and continued throughout Wales as a whole. The worst riots happened in the 1790s after a grain shortage, which coincided with political upheaval in the form of forced military service and high taxes on the roads, leaving farmers unable to make a profit. As a result of riots by colliers in the mid 1790s, magistrates in Glamorgan sold the rioters corn at a reduced price. At the same time they also requested military assistance from the government to stop further rioting. Due to the close-knit nature of the poor <b>communities,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> slightly higher status of the farmers above the labourers, the rioters generally blamed the farmers and corn merchants, rather than the gentry.|$|E

5|$|Yosemite National Park has {{documented}} more than 130 non-native plant species within park boundaries. These non-native plants were introduced into Yosemite following {{the migration of}} early Euro-American settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as wildland fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase in the spread of non-native plants. A number of these species aggressively invade and displace the native plant communities, resulting in impacts on the park's resources. Non-native plants can bring about significant changes in park ecosystems by altering the native plant <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> processes that support them. Some non-native species may cause {{an increase in the}} fire frequency of an area or increase the available nitrogen in the soil that may allow more non-native plants to become established. Many non-native species, such as yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), are able to produce a long tap root that allows them to out-compete the native plants for available water.|$|E
5|$|Sleaford {{served the}} {{surrounding}} agricultural <b>communities</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> town maintained a weekly market throughout the 19th {{century and a}} livestock market on Northgate from 1874 until 1984. According to a 2010 council report, the public sector was the town's main employer, along with agriculture and manufacturing. Unemployment was lower {{than the national average}} as were wages reflecting pay in the food processing and agricultural industries. At the 2011 Census, the largest group of working-age persons by economic activity are those in full-time employment, who make up 43.8% of this section of the population, while 15% are part-time employees and 7.7% are self-employed; 15% of the working-age population are retired. 4.2% were unemployed, with 40% of those in long-term unemployment and roughly one third were aged 16 to 24. The largest socio-economic grouping is those working in lower-tier managerial or administrative roles (21.9%), followed by semi-routine (17.8%), routine (15%) and intermediate (12.5%) occupations; no other group comprised 10% or more. In terms of industry, the most common, based on those working in the sector, are wholesale and retail trade (including automotive repairs) at 16.9%, health and social care (13.4%), public administration and defence (13.3%) and manufacturing (10.9%), with no other groups representing 10% or more. An unemployment survey of Lincolnshire in 2014 found that the county experienced a decline in unemployment (based on Jobseekers Allowance claimants) by 29% over the preceding 12 months, while the county's unemployment rate was marginally below the national average.|$|E
