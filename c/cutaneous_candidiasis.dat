40|$|Abstract Skin {{acts as a}} major target {{as well as a}} {{principle}} barrier for topical drug delivery. The greatest challenge for dermal delivery is stratum corneum, and in order to improve its permeability, new formulation approaches have been investigated. The main requirement for topical anti-fungal treatment is that the drugs should penetrate into skin layers to ensure effective drug concentrations following topical administration. Types of the formulations as well as the physicochemical characteristics of drug molecules are effective parameters in topical delivery of drugs. Antifungal drugs should reach effective therapeutic levels in the viable epidermis after dermal administration. The drug of choice for topical fungal disease is Fluconazole. Fluconazole has a broad spectrum of activity that includes both dermatophytes and yeasts. The drug is particularly effective in the treatment of mucosal and <b>cutaneous</b> forms of <b>candidiasis.</b> Vesicular system (Liposomes and ethosomes) entrapped in Gel {{is one of the most}} promising approaches for topical delivery of active substances and has potential for new opportunities for topical application of Fluconazole in the fungal infections...|$|R
40|$|Treatment of {{mucocutaneous}} and cutaneous Candida albicans infections with photosensitizing {{agents and}} light, termed photodynamic therapy (PDT), offers {{an alternative to}} conventional treatments. Initial studies using the clinically approved photosensitizer Photofrin demonstrated the susceptibility of C. albicans to its photodynamic effects. In the present study, we have further refined parameters for Photofrin-mediated photodynamic action against C. albicans and examined whether mechanisms commonly used by microorganisms to subvert either antimicrobial oxidative defenses or antimicrobial therapy, including biofilm formation, were operative. In buffer and defined medium, germ tubes preloaded with Photofrin retained their photosensitivity for up to 2 hours, indicating the absence of degradation or export of Photofrin by the organism. The addition of serum resulted in a gradual loss of photosensitivity over 2 hours. In contrast to an adaptive response by germ tubes to oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide, there was no adaptive response to singlet oxygen-mediated stress by photodynamic action. C. albicans biofilms were sensitive to Photofrin-mediated phototoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, the metabolic activity of C. albicans biofilms following photodynamic insult was significantly {{lower than that of}} biofilms treated with amphotericin B for the same time period. These results demonstrate that several of the mechanisms microorganisms use to subvert either antimicrobial oxidative defenses or antimicrobial therapy are apparently not operative during Photofrin-mediated photodynamic treatment of C. albicans.

The purpose of this longitudinal study was to analyze {{the relationship between the}} occurrence of mucocutaneous candidiasis and levels of anti-IL- 17 A, anti-IL- 17 F and anti-IL- 22 autoantibodies. We studied six APECED patients from four families with various disease manifestations. Clinical data were collected during regular follow-up. Anti-endocrine organ antibody levels and clinical chemistry and immunology parameters were determined in routine laboratory assays on freshly isolated serum. Levels of autoantibodies against IL- 17 A, IL- 17 F, IL- 22, IFN-α, IFN-ω and TNF-α, and cytokine release by Candida-exposed blood cells were determined by ELISA. Mutations were analyzed by sequencing genomic DNA. Four patients carried the germline c. 769 C[*]>[*]T homozygous nonsense mutation, which results in R 257 X truncation of the AIRE protein, and two patients from the same family were compound heterozygous for the c. 769 C[*]>[*]T/c. 1344 delC mutation. We found persistently high levels of antibodies against IL- 17 A in the serum samples of one patient presenting CMC since infancy and low or undetectable anti-IL- 17 A antibody levels in the sera of five patients with no candidiasis or without severe candidiasis. By contrast, levels of autoantibodies against IL- 17 F and IL- 22 were higher in all patients than in healthy controls. Release of IL- 17 -type cytokines by Candida-exposed blood mononuclear cells was low or negligible in all patients tested. We suggest that anti-IL- 17 A antibodies may {{play an important role in}} the predisposition to candidiasis of APECED patients. However, the lack of severe CMC in APECED patients with high levels of IL- 17 F and anti-IL- 22 autoantibodies clearly calls into question the role of these antibodies as the principal cause of <b>cutaneous</b> and mucosal <b>candidiasis</b> in at least some APECED patients. These data also suggest that the impaired release of IL- 17 -type cytokines by blood cells may be an element of the immunopathology of CMC in APECED patients...|$|R

Lanoconazole, (6) -(E) -[4 -(2 -chlorophenyl) - 1, 3 -dithiolan- 2 -ylidene]- 1 -imidazolylacetonitrile, is a new imidazole antimy-cotic agent, and clinical trials with 1 % cream and solution preparations completed in Japan demonstrated its therapeutic usefulness in the treatment of various dermatomycoses includ-ing tinea pedis, tinea corporis, and <b>cutaneous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (9). Consistently, in preclinical studies the same preparations of lanoconazole exhibited excellent therapeutic efficacy in guinea pig models of tinea pedis, tinea corporis, and cutaneous can...|$|E
40|$|The skin is {{the largest}} organ and forms the {{outermost}} part of the body. The skin and many cutaneous disorders {{are closely related to}} exogenous factors such as life style, environmental conditions, and so on. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} consider the skin and cutaneous disorders from a socio-environmental viewpoint. Since joining the Department of Dermatology about 40 years ago, I have been studying dermatomycoses and medical mycology as a subspecialty. During this period, the nature of cutaneous mycoses has changed. This paper covers the following topics: 1) gradual increases in the number of cases of tinea pedis among the elderly and children, 2) changes in prevalence of Microsporum canis infection, 3) increases in the number of cases of dermatophytosis caused by Trichophyton tonsurans in recent years, 4) the epoch-making development of a treatment for onychomycosis, 5) transition of the clinical type of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>candidiasis,</b> 6) expansion of knowledge about the pathogenesis and mycology of Malassezia species, 7) decreased prevalence of deep dermatomycoses such as sporotrichosis or dematiaceous fungus infection...|$|E
40|$|Adherence of {{microorganisms}} to epidermal corneocytes {{may be a}} prerequisite for cutaneous colonization and infection. Six species of Candida were assayed in vitro for adherence to human epidermal corneocytes and buccal mucosal cells, and compared to previous studies of pathogenicity in a rodent model of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>candidiasis.</b> C. albicans and C. stellatoidea exhibited marked adherence to both epithelial cell types over time, and were cutaneous pathogens in the rodent model. The remaining species showed little or no adherence, and were nonpathogenic to skin. Adherence to corneocytes was not inhibited by ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, mannan polysaccharide, or concanavalin A lectin. Fresh human serum, but not heat-inactivated serum, inhibited C. albicans adherence by 50 %, and {{was associated with the}} deposition of complement components, C 3 and factor B on blastospores. Adherence to epithelial corneocytes and mucosal cells is a property of pathogenic species of Candida, and may participate in cutaneous colonization and infection mechanisms. Adherence was time-dependent, and did not require divalent cations. Cell wall mannan may participate in the “adhesin” complex. Mannan activation of serum complement and deposition of C 3 and factor B on blastospores may provide a protective action by inhibiting Candida adherence to corneocytes...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Detection {{of agents}} {{responsible}} for cutaneous mycosis may {{be effective in}} the prevention of fungal infections from environmental and animal sources. With this background in mind, in this study, we aimed to identify the distribution of cutaneous mycotic infections in patients referred to Imam Reza Hospital of Mashhad, Iran during 2000 - 2011. Materials and Methods: In total, 8694 patients suspected of superficial and cutaneous mycosis, referred to the Medical Mycology Laboratory of Imam Reza Hospital of Mashhad, Iran, were recruited during March 2000 - 2011 and were examined in terms of fungal infections. Results: Of 8694 suspected patients, 3804 (43. 75 %) cases suffered from superficial and cutaneous mycosis. In total, 1936 (50. 9 %) patients were male, and 1868 (49. 1 %) were female. Malassezia infections (58. 1 %), dermatophytosis (33. 1 %), <b>cutaneous</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (6. 8 %), aspergillosis (1. 6 %), and saprophytic cutaneous mycosis (0. 4 %) were the most common infections. Conclusion: In this study, Malassezia infections were the most common superficial and cutaneous mycoses. Therefore, it seems essential to focus on the prevention of these infections in our society...|$|E
40|$|In 2009, a {{multinational}} group of clinicians {{was charged with}} reviewing and evaluating the research base pertaining to incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) and synthesizing this knowledge into best practice recommendations based on existing evidence. This {{is the first of}} 2 articles focusing on IAD; it updates current research and identifies persistent gaps in our knowledge. Our literature review revealed a small but growing body of evidence that provides additional insight into the epidemiology, etiology, and pathophysiology of IAD when compared to the review generated by the first IAD consensus group convened 5 years earlier. We identified research supporting the use of a defined skin care regimen based on principles of gentle perineal cleansing, moisturization, and application of a skin protectant. Clinical experience also supports application of an antifungal powder, ointment, or cream in patients with evidence of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>candidiasis,</b> aggressive containment of urinary or fecal incontinence, and highly selective use of a mild topical anti-inflammatory product in selected cases. The panel concluded that research remains limited and additional studies are urgently needed to enhance our understanding of IAD and to establish evidence-based protocols for its prevention and treatment. <br/...|$|E
