The inferred terrestrial vegetation represented by the Sokli MIS 3 sequence (so-called Tulppio Interstadial) was probably low-arctic tundra, treeless but with shrub elements including juniper, willow, dwarf birch, ericoids, lycopods and a rich herb flora with a variety of arctic-alpine taxa and heliophilous, pioneer elements. The presence of herbs such as Rubus chamaemorus, Epilobium palustre, Potentilla palustris and Sphagnum, Drepanocladus and other mosses suggests that the lake was fringed by wet meadows and peatlands or peaty telmatic communities.

In particular, the “refugial debate” centers on the possible retraction of habitats to limited areas that may have served as refuges for many associated species, especially during glaciations of the Quaternary. One prediction of such scenarios is that populations must have experienced substantial growth accompanying climatic amelioration and the occupation of newly expanded habitats. We used coalescence theory to examine the genetic evidence, or lack thereof, for late Pleistocene refugia of boreal North American and tropical Amazonian mammals. We found substantial and <b>concordant</b> <b>evidence</b> of demographic expansion in North American mammals, particularly at higher latitudes.

Results: Telomere length was significantly shorter in both the early and late subgroups of BD subjects when compared to the respective controls (p = 0. 002 and p = 0. 005, respectively). The sample size prevented additional subgroup analyses, including potential effects of medication, smoking status, and lifestyle.

The specific KS domain of the module EPO B fails to cluster phylogenetically with other epothilone KS sequences present at this locus, in contrast to what is typically observed in many other Type I polyketide synthase (PKS) biosynthetic loci. Furthermore, the GC content of the epoB KS, epoA ACP and NRPS domains differs significantly from the base composition of other epothilone domain sequences. In addition, the putatively transferred epothilone loci are located near previously identified transposon-like sequences. Lastly, comparison with other KS loci revealed another possible case of horizontal transfer of secondary metabolite genes in the genusPseudomonas.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patients with {{intractable}} epilepsy due to extensive lesions {{involving the}} posterior quadrant (temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes) form a small subset of epilepsy surgery. This study {{was done with}} a view to analyze our experience with this group of patients and to define the changes in the surgical technique over the last 15 years. We also describe the microsurgical technique of the different surgical variants used, along with their functional neuroanatomy. METHODS: In this series there were 13 patients with a median age of 17 years. All patients had extensive presurgical evaluation that provided <b>concordant</b> <b>evidence</b> localizing the lesion and seizure focus to the posterior quadrant. The objective of the surgery was to eliminate the effect of the epileptogenic tissue and preserve motor and sensory functions. RESULTS: During the course of this study period of 15 years, the surgical procedure performed evolved toward incorporating more techniques of disconnection and minimizing resection. Three technical variants were thus utilized in this series, namely, (i) anatomical posterior quadrantectomy (APQ), (ii) functional posterior quadrantectomy (FPQ), and (iii) periinsular posterior quadrantectomy (PIPQ). After a median follow-up period of 6 years, 12 / 13 patients had Engel's Class I seizure outcome. CONCLUSION: The results of surgery for posterior quadrantic epilepsy have yielded excellent seizure outcomes in 92 % of the patients in the series with no mortality or major morbidity. The incorporation of disconnective techniques in multilobar surgery has maintained the excellent results obtained earlier with resective surgery...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{cochlear}} implant (CI), by enabling oral communication in severely to profoundly deaf subjects, {{is one of}} the major medical advances over the last fifty years. Despite the globally very satisfactory results, individual outcomes vary considerably. The objective of this review is to describe the various factors influencing the results of CI rehabilitation with particular emphasis on the better understanding of neurocognitive mechanisms provided by functional brain imaging. The following aspects will be discussed: 1. Peripheral predictors such as the degree of preservation of nerve structures and the positioning of the electrode array. 2. The duration of auditory deprivation whose influence on brain reorganization is now becoming more clearly understood. 3. The age of initiation of hearing rehabilitation in subjects with pre-lingual deafness influencing the possibility of physiological maturation of nerve structures. 4. The concepts of sensitive period, decoupling and cross-modality. 5. In post-lingually deaf adults, brain plasticity can allow adaptation to the disability induced by deafness, subsequently potentiating CI rehabilitation, particularly as a result of audiovisual interactions. 6. Several studies provide <b>concordant</b> <b>evidence</b> that implanted patients present different phonological analysis and primary linguistic capacities. The results of CI rehabilitation are dependent on factors situated between the cochlea and cortical associative areas. The importance of higher cognitive influences on the functional results of {{cochlear implant}}ation justify adaptation of coding strategies, as well as global cognitive management of deaf patients by utilising brain plasticity capacities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —The {{lack of a}} readily {{accessible}} roster of nuclear genes informative at various taxonomic levels is a bottleneck for molecular systematics. In this report, we describe the first phylogenetic application of the sequence that encodes the enzyme dopa decarboxylase (DDC). For 14 test species within the noctuid moth subfamily Heliothinae that represent the previously best-supported groupings, a 690 -bp fragment of DDC resolved relationships that are largely <b>concordant</b> with prior <b>evidence</b> from elongation factor-la (EF-la), morphology, and allozymes. Although both syn-onymous and nonsynonymous changes occur in DDC substantially more rapidly {{than they do in}} EF-la, DDC divergences within Heliothinae are below saturation at all codon positions. Analysis of DDC and EF-la in combination resulted in increased bootstrap support for several groupings. As a first estimate of previously unresolved relationships, DDC sequences were analyzed from 16 additional heliothines, for a total of 30 heliothine species plus outgroups. Previous relationships based on DDC were generally stable with increased taxon sampling, although a two- to eightfold downweighting of codon position 3 was required for complete concordance with the 14 -species result. The weighted strict consensus trees were largely resolved and were congruent with most although not all previous hypotheses based on either morphology or EF-la. The proposed phy...|$|R
40|$|The precise {{steps leading}} from {{mutation}} of the {{polycystic kidney disease}} (PKD 1) gene to the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) phenotype remain to be established. Fluid accumulation is a requirement for cyst expansion in ADPKD, suggesting that abnormal fluid secretion into the cyst lumen might {{play a role in}} disease. In this study, we sought to establish a link between polycystin- 1 (the PKD 1 gene product) and ATP-stimulated Cl- secretion in renal tubule cells. To do this, we performed a whole cell patch-clamp analysis of the effects of expression of the isolated cytoplasmic COOH-terminus of polycystin- 1 in stably transfected mouse cortical collecting duct cells. The truncated polycystin- 1 fusion protein prolonged the duration of ATP-stimulated Cl- conductance and intracellular Ca 2 + responses. Both effects were dependent on extracellular Ca 2 +. It was determined that expression of the truncated polycystin- 1 fusion protein introduced, or activated, an ATP-induced Ca 2 + entry pathway that was undetectable in transfection control cell lines. Our findings are <b>concordant</b> with increasing <b>evidence</b> for a role of polycystin- 1 in cell Ca 2 + homeostasis and indicate that dysregulated Ca 2 + entry might promote Cl- secretion and cyst expansion in ADPKD...|$|R
40|$|The {{atypical}} chemokine receptor ACKR 2 promotes {{resolution of}} acute inflammation by operating as a scavenger receptor for inflammatory CC chemokines in several experimental models of inflammatory disorders, however {{its role in}} the brain remains unclear. Based on our previous reports of increased expression of inflammatory chemokines and their corresponding receptors following traumatic brain injury (TBI), we hypothesised that ACKR 2 modulates neuroinflammation following brain trauma and that its deletion exacerbates cellular inflammation and chemokine production. We demonstrate increased CCL 2 and ACKR 2 mRNA expression in post-mortem human brain, whereby ACKR 2 mRNA levels correlated with later times post-TBI. This data is consistent with the transient upregulation of ACKR 2 observed in mouse brain after closed head injury (CHI). As compared to WT animals, ACKR 2 -/- mice showed a higher mortality rate after CHI, while the neurological outcome in surviving mice was similar. At day 1 post-injury, ACKR 2 -/- mice displayed aggravated lesion volume and no differences in CCL 2 expression and macrophage recruitment relative to WT mice. Reciprocal regulation of ACKR 2 and CCL 2 expression was explored in cultured astrocytes, which are recognized as the major source of CCL 2 and also express ACKR 2. ACKR 2 mRNA increased as early as 2 hours after an inflammatory challenge in WT astrocytes. As expected, CCL 2 expression also dramatically increased at 4 hours in WT astrocytes but was significantly lower in ACKR 2 -/- astrocytes, possibly indicating a co-regulation of CCL 2 and ACKR 2 in these cells. Conversely, in vivo, CCL 2 mRNA/protein levels were increased similarly in ACKR 2 -/- and WT brains at 4 and 12 hours after CHI, in line with the lack of differences in cerebral macrophage recruitment and neurological recovery. In conclusion, ACKR 2 is induced after TBI and has a significant impact on mortality and lesion development acutely following CHI, while its role in chemokine expression, macrophage activation, brain pathology, and neurological recovery at later time-points is minor. <b>Concordant</b> to <b>evidence</b> in multiple sclerosis experimental models, our data corroborate a distinct role for ACKR 2 in cerebral inflammatory processes compared to its reported functions in peripheral tissues...|$|R
40|$|We {{reviewed}} {{available evidence}} for cardiovascular effects of n- 3 {{polyunsaturated fatty acid}} (PUFA) consumption, focusing on long chain (seafood) n- 3 PUFA, including their principal dietary sources, effects on physiological risk factors, potential molecular pathways and bioactive metabolites, effects on specific clinical endpoints, and existing dietary guidelines. Major dietary sources include fatty fish and other seafood. n- 3 PUFA consumption lowers plasma triglycerides, resting heart rate, and blood pressure and might also improve myocardial filling and efficiency, lower inflammation, and improve vascular function. Experimental studies demonstrate direct anti-arrhythmic effects, which have been challenging to document in humans. n- 3 PUFA affect a myriad of molecular pathways, including alteration of {{physical and chemical properties}} of cellular membranes, direct interaction with and modulation of membrane channels and proteins, regulation of gene expression via nuclear receptors and transcription factors, changes in eicosanoid profiles, and conversion of n- 3 PUFA to bioactive metabolites. In prospective observational studies and adequately powered randomized clinical trials, benefits of n- 3 PUFA seem most consistent for coronary heart disease mortality and sudden cardiac death. Potential effects on other cardiovascular outcomes are less-well-established, including conflicting evidence from observational studies and/or randomized trials for effects on nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation, recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, and heart failure. Research gaps include the relative importance of different physiological and molecular mechanisms, precise dose-responses of physiological and clinical effects, whether fish oil provides all the benefits of fish consumption, and clinical effects of plant-derived n- 3 PUFA. Overall, current data provide strong <b>concordant</b> <b>evidence</b> that n- 3 PUFA are bioactive compounds that reduce risk of cardiac death.

40|$|Objective To map {{the diverse}} health {{outcomes}} associated with serum uric acid (SUA) levels. Design Umbrella review. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and screening of citations and references. Eligibility criteria Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations between SUA level and health outcomes, meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials that investigated health outcomes related to SUA lowering treatment, and Mendelian randomisation studies that explored the causal associations of SUA level with health outcomes. Results 57 articles reporting 15 systematic reviews and 144 meta-analyses of observational studies (76 unique outcomes), 8 articles reporting 31 meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (20 unique outcomes), and 36 articles reporting 107 Mendelian randomisation studies (56 unique outcomes) met the eligibility criteria. Across all three study types, 136 unique health outcomes were reported. 16 unique outcomes in meta-analyses of observational studies had P< 10 - 6, 8 unique outcomes in meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials had P< 0. 001, and 4 unique outcomes in Mendelian randomisation studies had P< 0. 01. Large between study heterogeneity was common (80 % and 45 % in meta-analyses of observational studies and of randomised controlled trials, respectively). 42 (55 %) meta-analyses of observational studies and 7 (35 %) meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials showed evidence of small study effects or excess significance bias. No associations from meta-analyses of observational studies {{were classified as}} convincing; five associations were classified as highly suggestive (increased risk of heart failure, hypertension, impaired fasting glucose or diabetes, chronic kidney disease, coronary heart disease mortality with high SUA levels). Only one outcome from randomised controlled trials (decreased risk of nephrolithiasis recurrence with SUA lowering treatment) had P< 0. 001, a 95 % prediction interval excluding the null, and no large heterogeneity or bias. Only one outcome from Mendelian randomisation studies (increased risk of gout with high SUA levels) presented convincing evidence.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{decreasing}} mortality and increasing prevalence, prevention of HIV-transmission represents a public health priority. In the United States, the majority of infections are sexually-acquired, with {{men who have sex}} with men and minorities disproportionately affected. Although a number of promising biomedical prevention approaches have emerged over the past decade, a further 20 years could be needed before a suitable product becomes widely available. Evidence from vaccine and microbicide trials has shown that success in one population may not be replicated in another. To understand surprising or unexpected results, investigators need chronologically <b>concordant</b> <b>evidence</b> of both study product adherence and viral exposure. Since exposure to HIV cannot yet be independently verified, in seeking to measure this variable, investigators target the sexual behaviors through which it takes place deriving data for these surrogate measures from study participants' voluntary self-reports. Likely sources of reporting bias and efforts to minimize this phenomenon in {{the context of}} HIV-prevention research are critically reviewed in Chapter 1. Research describing the role of cognitive and affective functioning in the preparation of responses to potentially threatening questions is examined. Studies investigating techniques such as the use of colloquial language to facilitate comprehension, or variation in the length of the reference period to enhance recall are explored. Research comparing the effect of mode of administration on the amount of proscribed behavior reported - widely believed to correlate with validity - is reviewed. Contextual factors facilitating versus inhibiting disclosure of sensitive information are examined. Finally, risk-behavior measurement approaches used in selected HIV-prevention trials are inspected. Thereafter, the dissertation focuses on the properties of risk-assessment items, formulated specifically to elicit Global recall over six months, or Event-Specific (episodic) memory for selected recent episodes of limited duration, to capture sexual behaviors or temporally related activities. The capacity of the different questionnaire item formats to elicit responses with sufficient construct validity to serve as proxies for HIV-exposure is examined. Data for these studies are drawn from a large randomized controlled trial of a behavioral intervention to prevent HIV-transmission among {{men who have sex with}} men. Using a subset of 1295 cases and controls, models with good discriminant validity for HIV are derived separately for the Global and Event-Specific items. Thereafter, selected items from the two formats are combined to produce a single model with excellent discriminant validity, suggesting that these items can adequately represent true HIV-exposure. Next, a preliminary investigation of the contribution of psychosocial items to the predictive model based on exposure measures is undertaken. Specifically, interaction with exposure measures and the increase in discriminant validity obtained using data derived from constructs of partner type/relationship status, substance use, depressive symptoms and perceived self-efficacy is examined first in stratified analysis and then in logistic regression analysis using the case-control data. Effect-modification is observed for perceived relationship status and non-injection drug use. Evaluation of psychosocial items continues in a cohort study with prospective analysis of follow-up data from all trial participants who returned for at least one follow-up visit. Informed by the case-control study, a series of items representing psychosocial constructs known for their association with HIV-infection are tested for main effects and effect-modification. Evidence of the interaction observed in stratified analyses and confirmed in ordinary logistic regression persists in separate, topic-specific GEE analyses with assorted exposure measures, but abates in repeated measures analyses drawing on all available psychosocial items. Lastly, a single lagged variable indicating primary relationship status of the most recent partner (with respect to the preceding study visit) provides a significant addition to the model. Significant main effects for all except depressive symptoms and perceived self-efficacy and the increase in discriminant validity obtained for the multivariable model versus the `exposure-only' model are sufficient to warrant continued use of these risk-assessment items. Despite good predictive validity demonstrated for the sexual risk-behavior and psychosocial items, some inconsistent reporting between the Global and Event-specific formats is evident. Likely sources of this reporting bias are considered in light of the literature, and strengths and limitations of the overall study are discussed in the closing chapter...|$|E
40|$|Cryptic {{species are}} {{increasingly}} recognized as commonplace among marine gastropods, especially in taxa such as shell-less opisthobranchs that lack many discrete taxonomic characters. Most cases of poe-cilogony, {{the presence of}} variable larval development within a single species, have historically turned out to represent cryptic species, with each possessing a single canalized type of development. One well-characterized example of poecilogony was attributed to the sacoglossan opisthobranch Alderia modesta; in southern California, slugs resembling this member of a monotypic genus produce both long-lived, planktotrophic and short-lived, lecithotrophic larvae. Paradoxically, however, A. modesta is exclusively planktotrophic everywhere else in the northern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. A recently completed molecular study found that slugs from poecilogonous populations south of Bodega Harbor, California, comprise an evolutionarily distinct lineage separate from northern, strictly plank-totrophic slugs. We now describe the southern species as A. willowi n. sp., based on differences in mor-phology of the dorsum and radula, characteristics of the egg mass, larval development mode and nuclear and mitochondrial genetic markers. A DNA barcode is provided, based on 27 fixed differences in the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene that can reliably differentiate Pacific specimens of Alderia species.

40|$|Despite {{structural}} {{knowledge of}} broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NMAbs) complexed to HIV- 1 gp 120 and gp 41 envelope glycoproteins, virus inactivation mechanisms {{have been difficult}} to prove, in part because neutralization assays are complex and were previously not understood. <b>Concordant</b> with recent <b>evidence</b> that HIV- 1 titers are determined by a race between entry of cell-attached virions and competing inactivation processes, we show that NMAb 2 G 12, which binds to gp 120 N-glycans with α (1, 2) -linked mannose termini and inhibits replication after passive transfer into patients, neutralizes by slowing entry of adsorbed virions. Accordingly, apparent neutralization is attenuated when a kinetically competing virus inactivation pathway is blocked. Moreover, removing 2 G 12 from media causes its dissociation from virions coupled to accelerated entry and restored infectivity, demonstrating the reversibility of neutralization. A difference between 2 G 12 dissociation and infectivity recovery rates implies that the inhibited complexes at virus–cell junctions contain several 2 G 12 ’s that must dissociate before entry commences. Quantitative microscopy of 2 G 12 binding and dissociation from single virions and studies using a split CCR 5 coreceptor suggest that 2 G 12 competitively inhibits interactions between gp 120 ’s V 3 loop and the tyrosine sulfate-containing CCR 5 amino terminus, thereby reducing assembly of complexes that catalyze entry. These results reveal a unique reversible kinetic mechanism for neutralization by an antibody that binds near a critical V 3 region in the glycan shield of gp 120...|$|R
40|$|Identifying species {{groups is}} an {{important}} yet difficult task, with there being no single accepted definition as to what constitutes a species, nor a set of criteria by which they should be delineated. Employing the General Lineage Concept somewhat circumvents these issues, as this concept allows multiple <b>concordant</b> lines of <b>evidence</b> {{to be used as}} support for species delimitation, where a species is defined as any independently evolving lineage. Genetically diverse groups have previously been identified within the monotypic parastacid genus Tenuibranchiurus Riek, 1951, but no further investigation of this diversity has previously been undertaken. Analysis of two mitochondrial DNA gene regions has previously identified two highly divergent groups within this taxon, representing populations from Queensland (Qld) and New South Wales (NSW), respectively. Additional testing within this study of both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA through species discovery analyses identified genetically diverse groups within these regions, which were further supported by lineage validation methods. The degree of genetic differentiation between Qld and NSW populations supports the recognition of two genera; with Qld retaining the original genus name Tenuibranchiurus, and NSW designated as Gen. nov. until a formal description is completed. Concordance between the species discovery and lineage validation methods supports the presence of six species within Tenuibranchiurus and two within Gen. nov. The recognition of additional species removes the monotypy of the genus, and the methods used can improve species identification within groups of organisms with taxonomic problems and cryptic diversity.

40|$|The {{choice of}} carbohydrate-rich foods in the {{habitual}} diet should {{take into account}} not only their chemical composition but also their ability to influence postprandial glycemia (glycemic index). Fiber-rich foods generally have a low glycemic index (GI), although not all foods with a low GI necessarily have high fiber content. Several beneficial effects of low-GI, high-fiber diets have been shown, including lower postprandial glucose and insulin responses, an improved lipid profile, and, possibly, reduced insulin resistance. In nondiabetic persons, suggestive evidence is available from epidemiologic studies that a diet based on carbohydrate-rich foods with a low-GI, high-fiber content may protect against diabetes or cardiovascular disease. However, no intervention studies have so far evaluated the potential of low-GI, high-fiber diets {{to reduce the risk}} of diabetes, although in studies aimed at diabetes prevention by lifestyle modifications, an increase in fiber consumption was often part of the intervention. In relation to prevention of cardiovascular disease, intervention studies evaluating the effect of a low-GI diet on clinical events are not available; moreover, the results of the few available intervention studies evaluating the effects of GI on the cardiovascular disease risk factor profile are not always <b>concordant.</b> The best <b>evidence</b> of the clinical usefulness of GI is available in diabetic patients in whom low-GI foods have consistently shown beneficial effects on blood glucose control in both the short-term and the long-term. In these patients, low-GI foods are suitable as carbohydrate-rich choices, provided other attributes of the foods are appropriate...|$|R
40|$|A {{major effort}} is {{underway}} to select genetic polymorphisms potentially {{relevant to the}} clinical efficacy and safety of endocrine treatment of breast cancer. Genetic factors of the host that affect the metabolism of tamoxifen, a widely used drug for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer, have received particular attention. Cytochrome P 450 isoform 2 D 6 (CYP 2 D 6) is a key step in the metabolism of tamoxifen to its active moiety endoxifen. Women with functionally deficient genetic variants of CYP 2 D 6 who are given drugs that inhibit CYP 2 D 6 are exposed to low endoxifen plasma levels and may enjoy reduced benefits from tamoxifen treatment. Therefore, CYP 2 D 6 status {{may be an important}} predictor of the benefits of tamoxifen to an individual; unfortunately, the data are not uniformly <b>concordant,</b> and definitive <b>evidence</b> that would suggest the routine analysis of CYP 2 D 6 before commencing tamoxifen treatment is not yet available. Recent research has focused on the role UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, a family of metabolizing enzymes that {{play an important role in}} the metabolic clearance of tamoxifen and of the aromatase inhibitors as well, and how interindividual differences in these enzymes may play a role in the clinical outcome upon administration of anti-estrogen treatment. In conclusion, whether a pharmacogenetic profile should be obtained prior to initiating tamoxifen therapy is currently a matter of debate, although summing up all the scientific evidence available on this issue it appears that the genetic screening would be an useful support for clinical decision making in selected patients...|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out to study the endothelium-dependent ischemia-reperfusion injury upon the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the canine femoral artery. The tested experimental model was the inferior canine hindlimb ischemia induced by infrarenal abdominal aortic clamping followed by reperfusion. The research protocol was standardized in four exper-imental groups (n= 6) : (1) Control group; (2) Ischemia (120 minutes) group; (3) Ischemia (90 minutes) and reperfusion (60 minutes) group; and (4) Ischemia (120 minutes) and reperfusion (90 minutes) group. The femoral artery vascular reactivity was studied in vitro {{with the aid of}} an eight “organ chambers ” setup, where segments from 4 to 5 mm, with and without endothe-lium, were suspended and connected to force transducers. The fundamental data of this study were as follows: (1) Ischemia caused by 120 minutes of infrarenal aortic clamping did not cause femoral artery endothelium dysfunction. (2) Ischemia caused by 90 minutes of clamping followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion also did not cause endothelium dysfunction, with an observed tendency to signal transduction impairment (studied by the sodium fluoride dose response curves). (3) Ischemia caused by 120 minutes of clamping followed by 90 minutes of reperfusion caused endothelium dysfunction, observed by the femoral artery impaired capacity of the endothelium-dependent NO release evoked by acetylcholine, adenosine diphosphate, and sodium fluoride. The present pharmacologic in vitro observations are <b>concordant</b> with the <b>evidence</b> that the NO-release impairment, caused by inferior canine hindlimb ischemia followed by reperfusion, is a consequence of endothelium cell membrane receptors, and G-proteins signal transduction dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Human African trypanosomiasis is {{a lethal}} disease {{caused by the}} {{extracellular}} parasite Trypanosoma brucei. The proteins secreted by T. brucei inhibit the maturation of dendritic cells {{and their ability to}} induce lymphocytic allogenic responses. To better understand the pathogenic process, we combined different approaches to characterize these secreted proteins. Results Overall, 444 proteins were identified using mass spectrometry, the largest parasite secretome described to date. Functional analysis of these proteins revealed a strong bias toward folding and degradation processes {{and to a lesser extent}} toward nucleotide metabolism. These features were shared by different strains of T. brucei, but distinguished the secretome from published T. brucei whole proteome or glycosome. In addition, several proteins had not been previously described in Trypanosoma and some constitute novel potential therapeutic targets or diagnostic markers. Interestingly, a high proportion of these secreted proteins are known to have alternative roles once secreted. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis showed that a significant proportion of proteins in the secretome lack transit peptide and are probably not secreted through the classical sorting pathway. Membrane vesicles from secretion buffer and infested rat serum were purified on sucrose gradient and electron microscopy pictures have shown 50 - to 100 -nm vesicles budding from the coated plasma membrane. Mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of Trypanosoma proteins in these microvesicles, showing that an active exocytosis might occur beyond the flagellar pocket. Conclusions This study brings out several unexpected features of the secreted proteins and opens novel perspectives concerning the survival strategy of Trypanosoma as well as possible ways to control the disease. In addition, <b>concordant</b> lines of <b>evidence</b> support the original hypothesis of the involvement of microvesicle-like bodies in the survival strategy allowing Trypanosoma to exchange proteins at least between parasites and/or to manipulate the host immune system. </p...|$|R
40|$|One {{of forms}} common sense can take {{is that of}} {{clusters}} of strong and widely shared intuitions about some idea or subject. Something philosophy has typically done, since Plato onwards, is probing those clusters of intuitions {{in order to see}} if they can be subsumed under a coherent concept or definition, or not. If they can, philosophy wonders if this concept or definition is useful, well grounded or otherwise acceptable, and if not how it might be amended. If intuitions cannot be subsumed under a coherent concept, philosophy searches how this could possibly be done by rejecting the smallest number of weaker or more peripheral intuitions. Thus philosophy analyses, evaluates, regiments and possibly reforms common sense. This is what the debates rehearsed in the following pages do with the common sense notions of knowledge and justification, where the examples and counterexamples used by Plato, Gettier and subsequent literature are just ways to bring out the relevant intuitions. Gettier thought that the counterexamples offered in his famous “Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?” (1963) questioned the tripartite definition of knowledge as true justified belief in Plato’s Theaetetus; but I argue that they can as well be seen as a challenge to reassess the nature of justification, a question Plato had left open in the conclusion of that dialogue. He was very clear that knowledge must be non-accidental, and justification is required precisely to warrant the non-accidental character of beliefs. Gettier’s counterexamples and others similar in the subsequent literature show that justification cannot fully accomplish that task unless it makes the justified beliefs in principle certain. But since we are fallible, nothing we can grasp can make beliefs certain in principle. So, if justification is understood as an internal notion, i. e. as something we must have a full grasp of, the conclusion is that knowledge requires a fourth condition, beside belief, truth and justification. But what could it be? On the other hand, if we found a condition which entailed the truth of our beliefs, wouldn’t that condition more rightly deserve to be called justification? for it would accomplish the task for which justification is needed. Now, because of human fallibility, any such condition must be something external, transcending in principle subjective grasp. The other possible strategy is therefore adopting an external and objective notion of justification, already hinted at in Plato’s Meno. This can be done, for instance, assuming that a belief is justified when it is the last ring of a causal chain beginning with its truthmaker (A. Goldman). The idea that justification is provided by a causal chain justification has a number of problems: it cannot account for our knowledge of non physical (e. g. mathematical) facts, and of future facts, nor for the (possibly) non physical nature of some of the items from which beliefs are produced, such as perceptual experiences, mathematical intuitions, further beliefs, and inferences. Thus I use instead the more general notion of a productive chain, understood as a chain (a) whose links can be both physical causes, and such non physical processes as perceptual experiences, mathematical intuitions, further beliefs and inferences, and (b) which can originate either in a past truthmaker, or in the past cause of a future truthmaker, so that the latter can be inferred from the former. Moreover, as shown by some counterexamples in the literature, causal chains include “awkward” or “deviant” chains, which intuitively do not warrant knowledge. I then introduce the stronger notion of a normal productive chain, in which each ring is of a type normally produced (directly or indirectly) by facts of the type of the truthmaker, and I show that this nicely accounts for this class of purported counterexamples. Nonetheless, the etymological sense of the word ‘justification’ carries the deontological idea that justification ensures the subject’s right, or at least excuse, for holding a belief, and in this sense it must consist of internal evidences. Furthermore, I have already granted that such internal items, as perceptual experiences, further beliefs, and inferences, are typically part of productive chains. Finally, other counterexamples (e. g., BonJour’s clairvoyance example) show that sufficiently <b>concordant</b> internal <b>evidences</b> are also a necessary condition for knowledge. The conclusion is therefore that knowledge requires both an objective external condition, the productive chain, entailing truth, and a subjective condition, the internal evidences, which fall short of entailing truth, so accounting for human fallibility. At this point a terminological choice is open: wishing to keep only the purely subjective deontological sense of ‘justification’, one can use this term for the internal evidence, and claim that knowledge requires an additional objective condition, beside justification, viz. the productive chains. But since the existence of a productive chain entails the truth of the belief, conditions will still be three: belief, justification and productive chain. Otherwise, one may wish to keep both the senses traditionally attached to justification: bestowing a subjective right or excuse, and providing an objective warrant. Hence, justification will require both the internal evidences and the productive chain, and knowledge will require just two conditions, belief and justification, for justification in this sense entails truth...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{methods for}} the {{determination}} of past soil erosion provide only average rates of erosion of the sediment 2 ̆ 7 s source areas and are unable to determine the rate of at-a-site soil loss. In this study, we report in-situ produced cosmogenic 10 Be, and 14 C measurements from erratic boulders and two depth-profiles from Younger Dryas moraines in Scotland, and assess {{the extent to which}} these data allow the quantification of the amount and timing of site-specific Holocene soil erosion at these sites. The study focuses on two sites located on end moraines of the Loch Lomond Readvance (LLR) : Wester Cameron and Inchie Farm, both near Glasgow. The site near Wester Cameron does not show any visible signs of soil disturbance and was selected in order to test (i) whether a cosmogenic nuclide depth profile in a sediment body of Holocene age can be reconstructed, and (ii) whether in situ 10 Be and 14 C yield <b>concordant</b> results. Field <b>evidence</b> suggests that the site at Inchie Farm has undergone soil erosion and this site was selected to explore whether the technique can be applied to determine the broad timing of soil loss. The results of the cosmogenic 10 Be and 14 C analyses at Wester Cameron confirm that the cosmogenic nuclide depth-profile to be expected from a sediment body of Holocene age can be reconstructed. Moreover, the agreement between the total cosmogenic 10 Be inventories in the erratics and the Wester Cameron soil/till samples indicate that there has been no erosion at the sample site since the deposition of the till/moraine. Further, the Wester Cameron depth profiles show minimal signs of homogenisation, as a result of bioturbation, and minimal cosmogenic nuclide inheritance from previous exposure periods. The results of the cosmogenic 10 Be and 14 C analyses at Inchie Farm show a clear departure from the zero-erosion cosmogenic nuclide depth profiles, suggesting that the soil/till at this site has undergone erosion since its stabilisation. The LLR moraine at the Inchie Farm site is characterised by the presence of a sharp break in slope, suggesting that the missing soil material was removed instantaneously by an erosion event rather than slowly by continuous erosion. The results of numerical simulations carried out to constrain the magnitude and timing of this erosion event suggest that the event was relatively recent and relatively shallow, resulting in the removal of circa 20 - 50 cm of soil at a maximum of ∼ 2000 years BP. Our analyses also show that the predicted magnitude and timing of the Inchie Farm erosion event are highly sensitive to the assumptions that are made about the background rate of continuous soil erosion at the site, the stabilisation age of the till, and the density of the sedimentary deposit. All three parameters can be independently determined a priori and so do not impede future applications to other localities. The results of the sensitivity analyses further show that the predicted erosion event magnitude and timing is very sensitive to the 14 C production rate used and to assumptions about the contribution of muons to the total production rate of this nuclide. Thus, advances in this regard need to be made for the method presented in this study to be applicable with confidence to scenarios similar to the one presented here...|$|R
40|$|The {{senses of}} hearing and {{equilibrium}} are {{highly dependent on}} the fluid and electrolyte homeostasis in the inner ear. The characteristic intracellular-like ionic composition of endolymph fluid {{in relation to the}} surrounding perilymph creates the endocochlear potential (EP), which is a prerequisite for inner ear function. Disturbed regulation of endolymph production is thought to be responsible for certain inner ear disorders, such as for example Ménière's disease. The stria vascularis (SV) and the spiral ligament (SL) in the cochlea and dark cell areas in the vestibular saccule, utricle and ampullae are known to be responsible for production of endolymph fluid, but the precise mechanisms remain to be explored. The ubiquitous enzyme Na,K-ATPase is known {{to play an important role}} in endolymph production. There is evidence indicating that corticosteroid hormones, including glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormone, take part in the regulation of Na,K-ATPase expression and activity in the inner ear. Glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) have been demonstrated in the inner ear of the rat. The overall purpose of this work was to investigate if the expression of Na,K-ATPase in the developing and adult mouse cochlea and the maturation of the cochlea is dependent on the presence of corticosteroid receptors. Distribution of Na,K-ATPase, GR and MR in the developing mouse inner ear was investigated using an immunohistochemical method. Appearance of the complete Na,K-ATPase heterodimer in the SV and SL coincides with the rise of endolymphatic K+ concentration, the completion of the morphological maturation of the SV, and the first detectable cochlear potential. This result is <b>concordant</b> with established <b>evidence</b> concerning the role of Na,K-ATPase in the production of endolymph and the EP. The appearance of GR also seems to follow a distinct pattern from the time of early organogenesis to adulthood, paralleling Na,K-ATPase appearance and the structural and functional maturation of the cochlea, which may indicate that GR take part in the regulation of Na,K-ATPase expression in the developing cochlea. An almost adult pattern of MR immunostaining was seen as early as around birth, with no significant changes taking place thereafter, meaning that maturation of the distribution of MR in the mouse inner ear takes place much earlier than Na,K-ATPase expression. The hypothesis that MR is the major regulating factor of Na,K- ATPase expression in the cochlea cannot be confirmed. In the inner ear of both the GR-knockout mouse and the MR-knockout mouse, Na,K-ATPase content and distribution remained normal. Accordingly, the hypothesis that corticosteroid hormones via GR or MR are the major regulating factor of Na,K-ATPase expression cannot be confirmed. Finally, two mouse strains with severe hereditary inner ear disease, displaying symptoms that are typical for a combined dysfunction of hearing and equilibrium as can be seen following derangement of endolymph homeostasis, were examined. The shaker- 2 mouse suffers from progressive degeneration of the SV and severely disturbed ionic composition of the endolymph. Reduced amounts of GR, MR and Na,K-ATPase are found in all tissues of the shaker- 2 mouse cochlea. The mix mouse is a new strain, with deafness and circling behaviour. It seems that the cochlear and vestibular hair cells in the mix mouse are severely degenerated, the SV is atrophic, and the endolymphatic space has collapsed, indicating that there is no endolymph production. Amounts of GR, MR and Na,K-ATPase are reduced in the atrophic SV of the mix mouse, but normal in the remaining cochlea. The reduced amounts of Na,K-ATPase, in the shaker- 2 mouse in the whole cochlea and in the mix mouse in the SV, may be a very important mechanism behind the disturbed endolymph production seen in both strains. The results showing that the amounts of MR and GR are diminished in the same tissues where also Na,K- ATPase abundance is reduced, however, should be handled with care and do not necessarily indicate that reduced Na,K-ATPase expression is a result of reduced amounts of corticosteroid receptors. Na,K-ATPase expression in the inner ear is regulated by mechanisms interacting in a very complex fashion. The results of this study indicate that corticosteroid hormones and their receptors are part of this regulating mechanism, but can be compensated for in case of failure...|$|R
