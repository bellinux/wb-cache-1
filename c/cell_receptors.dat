5|$|Helper T cells express T <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> (TCR) that {{recognize}} antigen {{bound to}} Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also {{recognized by the}} helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) {{that are responsible for}} the T cell's activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} study we reported that clonally expanded T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> β-chain rearrangements characterized the T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> usage in skin lesions of psoriasis vulgaris and indicated antigen-specific T cell selection. To assess the relevance of clonal T cell expansion for disease progression, we now determined if select clonal T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> rearrangements persisted over time and were present in nonlesional skin. Sequential biopsies were taken from psoriatic skin lesions of two patients. V-D-J junctional regions of T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> β-chain variable region gene families 2, 3, 6, 13 S 1, and BV 17 were cloned and sequenced, as these particular BV gene families are preferentially selected in psoriatic skin lesions. The lesional T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> rearrangements were compared with the T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> usage in nonlesional skin and in blood. Several T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> β-chain rearrangements with high transcript frequency in the first lesional biopsy were again found in sequential lesional biopsies taken as much as 3 y later from psoriasis relapses. Only T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> β-chain rearrangements with low transcript abundance showed variability in that several clones appeared {{for the first time}} or disappeared. Although nonlesional skin also exhibited a restricted T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> usage with clonal T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> rearrangements, the T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> usage in lesional and nonlesional skin differed nearly completely. The select lesional recurrence of identical T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> rearrangements reveals that inflammation in psoriasis involves the same clonally expanded T cell populations and the same antigens over prolonged periods of time. It hereby suggests that specifically recruited and locally expanded T cell clones are permanently involved in psoriatic inflammation and may play a crucial part in disease perpetuation...|$|R

25|$|The key {{disadvantage}} in a gene rearrangement process for T <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> {{is that by}} random chance, some arrangements of gene fragments will create a T cell receptor capable of binding self-peptides presented on MHC class I or MHC class II. If T cells bearing these T <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> were to enter the periphery, they {{would be capable of}} activating an immune response against self, resulting in autoimmunity. Negative selection is the process evolved to reduce this risk. During negative selection, all thymocytes with a high affinity for binding self peptides presented on MHC class I or class II are induced to upregulate BCL2L11, a protein which drives apoptosis. Cells which do not have a high affinity for self-antigens survive negative selection. At this stage, some cells are also selected to become regulatory T cells, usually cells which have an intermediate affinity for self-peptide.|$|E
40|$|The trimolecular complex {{comprised}} {{of the major}} histocompatibility complex, peptide antigen, and the T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> is a requisite for T cell activation in normal and autoimmune responses. T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> analysis is critical to further our understanding regarding mechanisms of T cell epitope selection and autoimmune initiation and progression and may help to identify targets for immunotherapy. Pemphigus foliaceus is an autoimmune blistering skin disease characterized by intraepidermal blisters and circulating autoantibodies directed against desmoglein 1, a 160 kDa transmembrane desmosomal molecule expressed in keratinocytes. As tissue damage is mediated by anti-desmoglein 1 antibodies, an initial T cell response is a likely requirement for autoantibody generation in this disease. To elucidate the role of pathogenic T cells in autoimmunity further, we have directly characterized the T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> of T <b>cells</b> derived from pemphigus foliaceus patients. Complementary DNA was isolated from 17 desmoglein 1 specific T cell clones generated from pemphigus foliaceus patients by clonal expansion in vitro. To analyze the T cell repertoire, a panel of primers, collectively specific for the known human T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> β variable region (TCRBV) families were paired with a constant region primer to polymerase chain reaction to amplify one distinct T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> β variable region allele for each T cell clone studied. Polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced to determine exact β chain gene usage. In the 17 clones tested, 10 distinct T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> β variable region usages and nine T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> β joining gene segment usages were identified. Furthermore, T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> β variable region and β joining usage {{did not appear to}} be random, but oligoclonal in nature, with some preference shown for T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> β variable region 5 S 1 and T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> BJ 2 S 5...|$|R

25|$|Thymocytes which pass β-selection {{express a}} T cell {{receptor}} which {{is capable of}} assembling on the surface. However, many of these T <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> will still be non-functional, due to an inability to bind MHC. The next major stage of thymocyte development is positive selection, to keep only those thymocytes which have a T cell receptor capable of binding MHC. The T cell receptor requires CD8 as a coreceptor to bind to MHC class I, and CD4 as a coreceptor to bind MHC class II. At this stage thymocytes upregulate both CD4 and CD8, becoming double positive cells.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{function}} of PfEMP1 is to bind and attach RBCs {{to the wall}} of the blood vessels. The most important binding properties of P. falciparum known to date are mediated by the head structure of PfEMP1, consisting of DBL domains and CIDRs. DBL domains can bind to a variety of <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> including thrombospondin (TSP), complement receptor 1 (CR1), chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), P-selectin, endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), and heparan sulfate. The DBL domain adjacent to the head structure binds to ICAM1. CIDRs mainly bind to a large variety of cluster determinant 36 (CD36). These bindings produce the pathogenic characteristics of the parasite, such as sequestration of infected cells in different tissues, invasion of RBCs, and clustering of infected cells by a process called rosetting.|$|E

25|$|Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing {{invariant}} T <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> (TCRs), such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T cells, γδ T cells exhibit {{characteristics that}} place {{them at the}} border between innate and adaptive immunity. On one hand, γδ T cells may be considered a component of adaptive immunity in that they rearrange TCR genes to produce junctional diversity and develop a memory phenotype. However, the various subsets may also be {{considered part of the}} innate immune system where a restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as a pattern recognition receptor. For example, according to this paradigm, large numbers of Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes, and highly restricted intraepithelial Vδ1 T cells will respond to stressed epithelial cells.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most genes, {{which have}} a stable {{sequence}} in each cell which expresses them, the T cell receptor {{is made up of}} a series of alternative gene fragments. In order to create a functional T cell receptor, the double negative thymocytes use a series of DNA-interacting enzymes to clip the DNA and bring separate gene fragments together. The outcome of this process is that each T cell receptor has a different sequence, due to different choice of gene fragments and the errors introduced during the cutting and joining process (see section on V(D)J recombination for more information on TCR rearrangement). The evolutionary advantage in having a large number of unique T <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> is that each T cell is capable of recognizing a different peptide, providing a defense against rapidly evolving pathogens.|$|E
500|$|A naive (or inexperienced) B cell is {{one which}} {{belongs to a}} clone which has never {{encountered}} the epitope {{to which it is}} specific. In contrast, a memory B cell is one which derives from an activated naive or memory [...] B cell. The activation of a naive or a memory B cell is followed by a manifold proliferation of that particular B cell, most of the progeny of which terminally differentiate into plasma B cells; the rest survive as memory B cells. So, when the naive cells belonging to a particular clone encounter their specific antigen to give rise to the plasma cells, and also leave a few memory cells, this is known as the primary immune response. In the course of proliferation of this clone, the B cell receptor genes can undergo [...] frequent (one in every two cell divisions) mutations in the genes coding for paratopes of antibodies. These frequent mutations are termed somatic hypermutation. Each such mutation alters the epitope-binding ability of the paratope slightly, creating new clones of B cells in the process. Some of the newly created paratopes bind more strongly to the same epitope (leading to the selection of the clones possessing them), which is known as affinity maturation. Other paratopes bind better to epitopes that are slightly different from the original epitope that had stimulated proliferation. Variations in the epitope structure are also usually produced by mutations in the genes of pathogen coding for their antigen. Somatic hypermutation, thus, makes the B <b>cell</b> <b>receptors</b> and the soluble antibodies in subsequent encounters with antigens, more inclusive in their antigen recognition potential of altered epitopes, apart from bestowing greater specificity for the antigen that induced proliferation in the first place. When the memory cells get stimulated by the antigen to produce plasma cells (just like in the clone's primary response), and leave even more memory cells in the process, this is known as a secondary immune response, which translates into greater numbers of plasma cells and faster rate of antibody production lasting for longer periods. The memory B cells produced as a part of secondary response recognize the corresponding antigen faster and bind more strongly with it (i.e., greater affinity of binding) owing to affinity maturation. The soluble antibodies produced by the clone show a similar enhancement in antigen binding.|$|E
40|$|Competing {{positive}} and negative signaling feedback pathways {{play a critical role}} in tuning the sensitivity of T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> activation by creating an ultrasensitive, bistable switch to selectively enhance responses to foreign ligands while suppressing signals from self peptides. In response to T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> agonist engagement, ERK is activated to positively regulate T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> signaling through phosphorylation of Ser 59 Lck. To obtain a wide-scale view of the role of ERK in propagating T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> signaling, a quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of 322 tyrosine phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry was performed on the human Jurkat T cell line in the presence of U 0126, an inhibitor of ERK activation.

Although the majority of identified sites on T <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> signaling proteins showed decreases in phosphorylation, Tyr 598 of ZAP- 70 showed elevated phosphorylation in response to U 0126 treatment, suggesting differential regulation of this site via ERK feedback.

In virtually all cases, B cell lineage ALL cells are arrested at the pre-B cell stage or before.

Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) leukemia carrying the t(9; 22) (q 34;q 11) translocation {{is defined by the}} constitutively active oncogenic tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL 1. In addition, in > 80 % of cases deletions of IKAROS gene are found in Ph+ ALL. We have recently shown that Ph+ ALL can also be defined by deficiency of a functional pre-B cell receptor.; During normal B cell development, pre-B <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> signaling first induces proliferation of the B cell precursors (large cycling pre-B cells, Fraction C’) and then causes cell cycle arrest at the time of Ig light chain gene rearrangement to initiate differentiation (small pre-B cells, Fraction D). Here we show that expression of µ chain (immunoglobulin heavy chain) in BCR-ABL 1 transformed cells or reconstitution of SLP 65 (a major adaptor protein in pre-B <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> signaling complex) in Slp 65 -/- BCR-ABL 1 cells induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.; Dissecting the mechanism of tumor suppression by the pre-B <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> in BCR-ABL 1 ALL, we studied Stat 5 signaling, a central mediator of survival and proliferation downstream of the BCR-ABL 1 kinase. Forced expression of pre-B <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> or Ikaros resulted in rapid dephosphorylation of Stat 5 Y 694 and concomitant upregulation of BCL 6. Upregulation of BCL 6 is causally linked with pre-B <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> induced <b>cell</b> cycle arrest. By genome wide ChIP-on-chip analysis we observed direct recruitment of BCL 6 transcriptional repressor to promoters of MYC and CCND 2, two key mediators of cell cycle progression in Ph+ ALL. Forced expression of BCL 6 induced a cell cycle arrest in BCR-ABL 1 transformed ALL and in addition Bcl 6 -deficient BCR-ABL 1 transformed pre-B cells were more resistant than the Bcl 6 +/+ cells to the tumor suppression by the pre-B <b>cell</b> <b>receptor.</b> Further overexpression of Myc could rescue the pre-B <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> mediated <b>cell</b> cycle arrest.; In the process of studying how the pre-B <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> results in dephosphorylation of Stat 5, we found Ikaros as key mediator.

In addition, reconstitution of Ikaros resulted in significant Stat 5 dephosphorylation and this event required the pre-B <b>cell</b> <b>receptor</b> associated adapter molecule SLP 65.
