40|$|Two-stage dilute acid {{pretreatment}} {{followed by}} enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis {{is an effective}} method for obtaining high sugar yields from wood residues such as softwood forest thinnings. In the first-stage hydrolysis step, most of the hemicellulose is solubilized using relatively mild conditions. The soluble hemicellulosic sugars are recovered from the hydrolysate slurry by washing with water. The washed solids are then subjected to more severe hydrolysis conditions to hydrolyze approx 50 % of the cellulose to glucose. The remaining cellulose can further be hydrolyzed with cellulase enzyme. Our process simulation indicates {{that the amount of}} water used in the hemi-cellulose recovery step has {{a significant impact on the}} cost of ethanol produc-tion. It is important to keep water usage as low as possible while maintaining relatively high recovery of soluble sugars.

40|$|In this study, a {{continuous}} manufacturing process {{was developed for}} adsorbing liquid self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) on mesoporous silica carriers {{in order to produce}} solid free flowing SEDDS powders. An optimized liquid SEDDS, consisting of Labrafil M 1944 CS, Labrasol and Capryol 90 (15, 80, 5 %w/w), was developed. The formulation spontaneously formed a homogenous emulsion with a droplet size of less than 200 nm (in water) and possessed pH robustness (pH 1. 2, pH 6. 8). Two grades of mesoporous silica were investigated as solid carriers, namely Syloid XDP 3050 and 3150. A twin screw extruder, setup in the granulation configuration, was employed to assess the mixing and adsorption of liquid SEDDS onto silica particles in a <b>continuous</b> process. <b>Screw</b> configuration, ratio of solid carrier to liquid SEDDS, powder and liquid feed rates and screw speed were identified as important parameters. These parameters were tested and optimized to achieve free flowing solid SEDDS. The maximum lipid loading of Syloid XDP 3050 and 3150 was 1 : 2 and 1 : 2 to less than 1 : 3 ratios, respectively. Although increasing liquid SEDDS loading increased the cohesive properties of the silica particles, the resulting powders afforded acceptable flow rate indexes as determined by powder rheometry. Similar self-emulsification behaviour was observed for solid and liquid SEDDS. With increasing lipid loading, the droplet size of emulsified solid SEDDS increased and changed from a unimodal to a bimodal size distributions. This effect was more pronounced for Syloid XDP 3050. Syloid XDP 3150 was less sensitive to droplet size changes as its z-average diameters at 1 : 2 - 1 : 3 ratio were similar to the optimized liquid SEDDS. Targeting a lipid loading ratio of 2 : 1, process parameters were varied to maximise material throughput. The investigated continuous process of adsorbing liquid SEDDs onto solid carriers produced solid SEDDS with good flow properties.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between a screw dislocation and an interface cylindrical hole {{is found to}} depend on the source and location of the screw dislocation. When a screw dislocation is inside one of the media it has one image in the other medium. If the real dislocation is emitted from the hole which is originally stress free, it has only two images inside the hole. However, if the real dislocation is emitted from elsewhere and moves to the vicinity of the hole, there is a third image {{at the center of the}} hole to keep the total Burgers vector of the images in the hole zero. These considerations were used to study the interaction of a screw dislocation with an interface crack (or elliptical hole) by means of conformal mapping. The effect of the screw dislocation on the stress intensity factor at the crack tip is <b>continuous</b> when the <b>screw</b> dislocation moves from one medium across the interface to the other medium. The image force can be divided into two parts. One part is due to the interface and the other is due to the interface crack. The composite solid behaves like a homogeneous solid with an effective shear modulus when the dislocation is in the interface. The {{interaction between}} two or more screw dislocations in the presence of an interface crack is studied also.

40|$|For decades, the {{manufacturing}} of solid dosage {{forms in the}} pharmaceutical industry has been synonymous with batch processing. However, batch processes are often sensitive to variability (possibly resulting in batch rejection or reprocessing), high labor costs (due to the multiple manual interventions during processing), high production costs, excessive inventories and scale-up issues. On the other hand, many advantages are associated with continuous processing which are all related to important economic drivers for change (i. e. quality, cost and time). However, implementation of new technologies, methodologies and equipment is needed to allow transfer from batch to continuous manufacturing within the pharmaceutical industry. As wet granulation {{is the most popular}} method to improve material properties (flow, homogeneity, compressibility) prior to tableting, it is obvious that a continuous wet granulation process is of high importance for a manufacturer of solid dosage forms. At the Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology (Ghent University) a <b>continuous</b> twin <b>screw</b> wet granulation process using a modified twin-screw extruder was developed. Based on this research work, GEA Pharma Systems developed a fully integrated ‘from-powder-to-tablet’ manufacturing line, the ConsiGmaTM system, using twin screw granulation as an intermediate step for wet granulation of raw materials. The overall objective of this project was {{to bridge the gap between}} the existing technology and its industrial implementation. Although technical know-how about the continuous granulation system is available at the manufacturer of this system, process knowledge (certainly towards specific pharmaceutical formulations) about this innovative manufacturing technique is limited within the pharmaceutical industry. Also in scientific literature the number of papers dealing with continuous wet granulation is limited. Therefore, the continuous granulation of pharmaceuticals by means of the ConsiGmaTM system was investigated in order to (a) improve process knowledge and process understanding of this novel manufacturing tool for solid dosage forms and (b) simplify scale-up and transfers in pharmaceutical manufacturing. To meet these objectives, the parameters affecting the quality of the end product manufactured via continuous wet granulation using the ConsiGmaTM system were determined via a series of experiments which evaluated the different aspects of this granulation technique: influence of formulation, process and equipment parameters on granule and tablet quality, visualization and understanding of granulation liquid mixing and distribution, use of continuous granulation for formulation development and process optimization, stability and repeatability of the continuous granulation process and in-line blending capacity of the granulation unit...|$|R
40|$|At the University of Pretoria's Fluoropolymer Laboratory, an {{important}} long-term {{project is the}} development of a waste polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) depolymerisation process where TFE can be produced, purified and polymerised to reproduce pure PTFE. At the start of this project, the process consisted of a batch depolymerisation system, a sub-zero distillation column, and a polymerisation reactor system. The batch depolymerisation system could not produce enough gas per session to operate the downstream processes efficiently. The main aim of this investigation was to adapt the batch depolymerisation system to enable continuous depolymerisation by designing, implementing and testing a <b>continuous</b> PTFE <b>screw</b> feeder. With the screw feeder in place, the operating limits, with regard to temperature, pressure, and Teflon® PTFE 807 N feed rate, were determined. The effects of temperature and pressure on the tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), hexafluoropropylene (HFP) and octafluorocyclobutane (OFCB) fractional composition were examined and the optimum operating conditions to maximise these products were determined statistically. An investigative approach was used in designing the hopper system. The optimum hopper wall angle and Teflon® PTFE 807 N feed mixture was determined experimentally by testing four hopper angles, pure Teflon® PTFE 807 N, and two Teflon® PTFE 807 N mixtures (Teflon® PTFE 807 N mixed with larger, compressed Teflon® PTFE 807 N, particles in a 70 : 30 wt % and 50 : 50 wt % ratio) and two motor speeds. At all of the hopper angles and Teflon mixture configurations, rat-hole formation prevented the feeder from producing a constant flow rate. A hopper wall angle of 20 ° (to the vertical) together with plain Teflon® PTFE 807 N were selected, as these two variables together helped to delay the formation of rat-holes the most. A stirrer was inserted in the hopper to negate the rat-holing problem. The continuous feeder was successfully designed, manufactured, calibrated, and installed. The feeder consists of a wedge-shaped hopper with a constant pitch, a tapered shaft screw and is capable of providing a maximum Teflon® PTFE 807 N flow rate of approximately 20 g·min- 1 for up to 40 min. Experimental test runs of the continuous depolymerisation system indicated that the minimum operating reactor temperature was 650 °C due to heat transfer and or rate of reaction limitations. The maximum flow rate of Teflon® PTFE 807 N was determined to be 11 g·min- 1 for the current reactor system. The maximum operating temperature and pressure were limited to 750 °C and 40 kPa, respectively, to avoid operating conditions that could lead to the increased production of PFIB. A three-level full factorial experimental design was used to determine the temperature and pressure effects on the fractional distribution of TFE, HFP, and OFCB under steady operating conditions. For pressure control purposed no carrier gas was used. The PTFE flow rate and experimental run time were kept constant at 11 g·min- 1 and 15 min, respectively. The pressure in the system was regulated manually by constricting the flow of product gas out of the system. A maximum TFE mole percentage of 97 % was achieved at operating conditions of 650 °C and 2 kPa. The maximum HFP mole percentage (31 %) was observed at operating conditions of 750 °C and 20 kPa. A maximum of 55 % was observed at 750 °C and 40 kPa for OFCB. Statistical analysis of the continuous depolymerisation results indicate that TFE formation is highly sensitive to changes in pressure, with higher TFE yield fractions achieved at low pressures. The production of OFCB is highly sensitive to pressure, whereas the formation of HFP is equally affected by pressure and temperature changes. However, changes in pressure have a larger effect on the HFP production than temperature when operating at pressures lower than approximately 20 kPa. At higher pressures the sensitivity has the inverse affect, with temperature having a larger effect. As opposed to TFE, an increase in temperature and pressure leads to an increase in the HFP and OFCB concentration. To achieve a TFE mole percentages of 95 % and higher, the operating temperature of the system has to be kept in the range of 650 °C 720 °C, together with a system pressure of 2 kPa or less. Within the operating range of 730 °C 750 °C and 35 kPa 40 kPa a mole percentage of 50 % and higher can be expected for OFCB. A mole percentage of 19 % and higher can be expected for HFP in the operating range of 744 °C 750 °C and 32 kPa 40 kPa. It was determined through a kinetic analysis of the system, that the residence time of the product gas in the reactor has a large effect on the production of HFP, with an increase in residence time leading to a sharp increase in the HFP concentration and a decrease in the OFCB and TFE concentrations. Analysis of the determined product specific kinetics indicate that the predominant HFP production pathway at low residence times (&# 060 3 s) is via the reaction of TFE with difluorocarbenes. At higher residence times the dominant reaction pathway is the dissociation OFCB. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017. Chemical EngineeringMEngUnrestricte...|$|R

The waste biomass was investigated for steam pyrolysisgasification in a <b>continuous</b> <b>screw</b> kiln reactor to produce hydrogen. The samples were gasified at different temperatures, steam/biomass ratios, and in the presence of nickel catalysts. The effects of nickel loading on the catalyst, the catalyst/waste biomass ratio, the effects of different metal additives and the effect of in-situ CO 2 capture were also investigated for hydrogen production and resistance to catalyst deactivation by coking. A commercial scale pyrolysis reactor was studied for the pyrolysis of real world wastes. FTIR and GC/MS analysis of the oils from the pyrolysis of waste biomass, RDF and their single components indicated that the oil product from high heating rate pyrolysis contained mostly aromatics and alkenes, while that from slow heating rate contained mostly oxygenates, alkanes and alkenes.

For each experiment, the material flows (seeds, press cake and crude oil) were measured and analysed for their oil, water and solids contents. The behaviour of oil expression was {{very sensitive to}} seeds preparation. It was shown that for whole seeds, a good reproducibility was obtained, whereas for crushed or deshelled seeds, heterogeneity of the feed led to unsteady pressing conditions and important discrepancies in the performance. The presence of seed shells contributes to build a porous solid matrix which favours oil flow through the press cake. For whole seeds, a correlation between oil recovery and seed throughput was proposed. The mass balance consistency was carefully analysed and oil yield was determined using a direct and an indirect method. A good linear correlation between seed and press cake throughputs was observed: the seed throughput is always divided in a stream of crude oil and a stream of press cake in the same proportion. This important result shows that the residual oil in press cake {{and the amount of}} solids carried by the oil are directly related and determine the efficacy of the separation. Thus, for a given screw press and feed material, the oil sediment content can be predicted knowing the oil recovery. The energy consumption during pressing was measured and modelled as a function of oil recovery and seeds oil content. The specific mechanical energy for oil expression was less than 5 % of the energy content of the oil and a minimum mechanical energy requirement was generally observed at oil recoveries between 70 % and 80 %.

40|$|Mechanical {{dewatering}} of cut alfalfa {{could replace}} the traditional method of field drying and {{would also be}} cheaper than total thermal dehydration in dryers. Juice from alfalfa also contains several compounds that would meet the growing demands of a low-calorie-fed population and also, provide compounds that could find a cure {{to some of the}} fatal communicable diseases. The major objective of this research is to find the pressure levels required to remove some of the initial moisture from shredded alfalfa {{and the quality of the}} pressed pulp and juice if alfalfa is mechanically dewatered in a pressure cell. The results from dewatering using the pressure cell are used to simulate the working of a <b>continuous</b> <b>screw</b> press for process optimization purposes. Experiments on dewatering of alfalfa were done on a screw press which is originally designed for extracting oil from oilseeds. The screw press was modified to simulate the field conditions of a continuous dewatering process for cut alfalfa. Measurements were done for dewatering power consumption and the pressed pulp was pelleted on a pilot scale pelleting mill. The quality of pressed pulp and expressed juice was analyzed at different screw speeds and choke openings. Using the available data from the above experiments, a quasimechanistic model was developed for the continuous dewatering process in a single-screw press. The model is based on a semi-empirical relationship given by Koegel et al. (1972) for dewatering of alfalfa in a batch-type hydraulic press. The model was tested against the experimental data and a sensitivity analysis was done by changing the variables. The agreement for predicted power and pressure is very poor. The results show that once the initial moisture is removed from fresh alfalfa at a low pressure of 2 - 4 MPa, further moisture removal from the dewatered pressed pulp becomes difficult even at considerably higher pressures. The efficiency of juice extraction can be enhanced by delaying the onset of the 'steady equilibrium moisture content state'. Comparison of energies using three different methods of pelleting shows that field drying can save energy by 13 % over combination of mechanical dewatering and thermal drying. Combination of mechanical dewatering and thermal drying can save energy by 45 % over total thermal dehydration. However considering the numerous value-added products obtained from the alfalfa juice and the fact that mechanical dewatering is a weather independent system, it seems to be a promising technology for the future...|$|E
40|$|Phenolic {{compounds}} {{are important}} constituents {{of white wine}} that can impart bitterness and astringency and influence stability and colour. The specific types and concentrations of phenolic compounds vary between the different grape tissues. For example grape skins contain much higher concentrations of phenolics than grape pulp. Consequently, grape processing techniques, particularly the method by which juice is expressed, can influence the phenolic profile of white wines. Concerns of elevated phenolic levels tend to lead to conservative practices such as limiting the time between machine harvesting and winery processing, {{and the use of}} relatively expensive batch draining and pressing equipment. Phenolic extraction during pomace contact, such as might occur after machine harvesting prior to winery processing, was investigated at a controlled laboratory scale. Contact time significantly increased phenolic extraction as did the fraction of broken berries. However, given the uncertainty in the amount of berry breakage in industrial practice, full scale transport trials should be performed by wineries where economic advantage could be gained from relaxing restriction on times between harvesting and winery processing. Techniques used for white grape juice expression both now and in the past were critically reviewed and winery sampling was performed to develop a practical understanding of operational issues. For the expression of juice from white grapes, pneumatic membrane presses have been increasingly adopted both for pressing and draining. This is principally a product of their ability to express high yields of juice with relatively low levels of phenolics and suspended solids. These devices can be operated in many different manners and quality and productivity is highly dependent on the specific mode of operation. Adaptive programmes based principally on continuous assessment of juice flow rate, and the use of conductivity measurement to monitor skin extraction are important tools that can aid economic optimisation of expression operations. The principal problem with the pneumatic membrane press {{is that it is a}} batch operation with a relatively low throughput. In the longer term, the ideal outcome would be the development of expression equipment that achieved the high throughput and relatively low cost per tonne of continuous inclined drainers and screw presses, while still maintaining the quality obtained with pneumatic membrane presses. Continuous devices that mimic the repeated cycles of compression and crumbling of these batch presses may be one means of achieving this. Exploration of the different <b>continuous</b> <b>screw</b> presses used historically suggests that there still may be room for improvement in these devices. This merits further specific investigation. Experiments involving repeated cycles of compression and crumbling were performed with a constant rate laboratory apparatus. These experiments demonstrated the importance of bed height, pressing speed, sieve plate design and crumbling on press operation. Solids content appears to be a major issue in the development of rapid juice expression equipment. One means of achieving appropriately low solids levels, without requiring large devices with large cake beds for juice filtration, may be to maintain the structure of the grape for as long as possible so that juice is filtered as it is expelled from the berry.
