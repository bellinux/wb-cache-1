40|$|An all {{too common}} feature of history has been how such externallyintroduced {{cultural}} institutions as religion, has served to move peoples from their parochial, self-contained communities into wider ones <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>universal</b> <b>values.</b> As it were, both Islam and Christianity, which are universal in intent, have served to induce peoples in Southeast Asia to conceive of themselves as part of wider human communities that have transcended the limitations of race, language, region and geography. Yet, paradoxically, Islam {{and to a lesser}} extent Christianity as well, have provided those very elements oi identity which played a large part in the struggle of the Malay peoples against foreign domination. No full understanding of these peoples' political, economic, and social conditions as well as of their concomittant expectations and tendencies is possible without taking into account the spiritual framework within which they lived...|$|R

His book Sahib E Quran is about the honor and attributes of the Prophet Muhammad. He started the book with the Na`at. In one chapter, he expresses the view {{that there is only}} defensive holy war in Islam.|$|R

This was embodied by the phrase [...] "I feel your pain", used by Bill Clinton during the 1992 United States Presidential Election. Other examples include Clinton's sharing of his life with an abusive and alcoholic stepfather, Al Gore's references to his son's car accident and sister's lung cancer, and House Representative Dick Gephardt's frequent recollection of weathering his son's childhood cancer as proof that he was <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> <b>universal</b> health care.|$|R

What is also interesting to note is that this was also questioned in the time of the prophet by Aisyah, who claimed that this tradition insulted women and likened them to bad beasts.

During the 1920s, under the Ukrainisation policy pursued by the national Communist leadership of Mykola Skrypnyk, Soviet leadership encouraged a national renaissance in the Ukrainian culture and language. Ukrainisation was part of the Soviet-wide policy of Korenisation (literally indigenisation).
