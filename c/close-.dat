500|$|There are a {{total of}} nine levels in Obi-Wan's Adventures that can be played with {{different}} difficult-settings. Obi-Wan is attacked by the Trade Federation's droids, bounty hunters, and other evil critters during his travels, and the player is able to control his lightsaber and blaster to defeat them. Both <b>close-</b> and long-range combat {{are available in the}} battles with the Federation's forces. The player can also take advantage of Obi-Wan's connection to the Force as a weapon. In order to do this, the player hits the [...] "A" [...] key to zoom in on the target and then hits [...] "A" [...] again to blow the enemy away. The power of the Force is limited and eventually runs out. To power up, the player accumulates Force pellets that can be obtained on the different levels. The Force is not only used as weapon, but also to get through the levels by moving objects that are in the way.|$|E

Gabbar Singh, the sadistic villain, ushered in an era in Hindi films characterised by [...] "seemingly omnipotent oppressors as villains", who play the pivotal role in setting up the context of the story, such as Shakal (played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda) of Shaan (1980), Mogambo (Amrish Puri) of Mr. India (1987) and Bhujang (Amrish Puri) of Tridev (1989).

6000|$|In a [...] "maze of buildings" [...] {{outside the}} precincts of {{the graves of}} Mycenae, Dr. Schliemann found {{fragments}} of vases much less ancient than {{the contents of the}} sepulchres. There was a large amphora, the [...] "Warrior Vase" [...] (Fig. 6). The men wear apparently a <b>close-</b> fitting coat of mail over a chiton, which reaches with its fringes half down the thigh. The shield is circular, with a half-moon cut out at the bottom. The art is infantile. Other warriors carry long oval shields reaching, at least, from neck to shin. [Footnote: Schuchardt, Schliemann's Excavations, pp. 279-285.] They wear round leather caps, their enemies have helmets. On a Mycenaean painted stele, apparently of the same relatively late period, the costume is similar, and the shield--oval--reaches from neck to knee. [Footnote: Ridgeway, vol. i. p. 314.] The Homeric shields do not answer to the smaller of these late and ugly representations, while, in their bronze plating, Homeric shields seem to differ from the leather shields of the Mycenaean prime.|$|E
60|$|The {{areas within}} which we shape our public {{activities}} at present, derive, I hold, from {{the needs and}} conditions of a past order of things. They have been patched and repaired enormously, but they still preserve the essential conceptions of a vanished organization. They have been patched and repaired first to meet this urgent specific necessity and then that, and never with any comprehensive anticipation of coming needs, and at last they have become absolutely impossible. They are like fifteenth-century houses which have been continuously occupied by a succession of enterprising but short-sighted and <b>close-</b> fisted owners, and which have now been, with the very slightest use of lath-and-plaster partitions and geyser hot-water apparatus, converted into modern residential flats. These local government areas of to-day represent {{for the most part}} what were once distinct, distinctly organized, and individualized communities, complete minor economic systems, and they preserve a tradition of what was once administrative convenience and economy. To-day, I submit, they do not represent communities at all, and they become more wasteful and more inconvenient with every fresh change in economic necessity.|$|E
60|$|As the macachina was {{the first}} wild flower to blossom in the land it had as great an {{attraction}} to us children as the wild strawberry, ground-ivy, celandine, and other first blooms for the child in England. Our liking for our earliest flower was all the greater because we could eat it and liked its acid taste, also because it had a bulb very nice to eat--a small round bulb {{the size of a}} hazel nut, of a pearly white, which tasted like sugar and water. That little sweetness was enough to set us all digging the bulbs up with table knives, but even little children can value things for their beauty as well as taste. The macachina was like the wood-sorrel in shape, both flower and leaf, but the leaves were much smaller and grew close to the ground, as the plant flourished most where the grass was <b>close-</b> cropped by the sheep, forming a smooth turf like that of our chalk downs. The flowers were never crowded together like the buttercup, forming sheets of shining yellow, but grew two or three inches apart, each slender stem producing a single flower, which stood a couple of inches above the turf. So fine were the stems that the slightest breath of wind would set the blossoms swaying, and it was then a pretty sight, and often held me motionless in the midst of some green place, when all around me for hundreds of yards the green carpet of grass was abundantly sprinkled with thousands of the little yellow blossoms all swaying to the light wind.|$|E

50|$|As the 1930s began, Hogue’s style {{began to}} emerge. He focused {{primarily}} on natural processes {{as well as the}} world of Native Americans and their relationship with the land. Hogue called himself an “abstract realist,” saying that naturalism is not possible because every artist recreates a realistic landscape and changes it to fit their own idea of what the view really looks like. He argues that naturalism is created in the head of the artist. In the 1960s Hogue’s self-defined style shifted more towards the abstract end. With realism still intact, Hogue did drawings and paintings of realistic images, but from different points of view, such as <b>close-</b> up studies like the Tent Olive images.|$|E
50|$|Geometrical {{frustration}} {{occurs when}} a set of degrees of freedom is incompatible with the space it occupies. A purely geometric example is the impossibility of <b>close-</b> packing pentagons in two dimensions. Another example is atomic magnetic moments with antiferromagnetic interactions. These moments lowers their interaction energy by pointing antiparallel to their neighbors. In case of two dimension, the triangular lattice is the simplest example. In triangular lattice the two spins can easily accommodate on two sides but the third spin is frustrated. If this third spin is up then two arrangement out of the three are compatible but one is incompatible. This leads to a huge degeneracy in the ground state with non-zero entropy. This frustration leads to breaking symmetry which leads to ferroelectricity.|$|E

He also extended schooling privileges to his relatives, friends in the military especially the graduates of professional military schools that are close to him, to Marcos and to Imelda, including those who paid homage to him and filled the high posts in the military with Ilocano ROTC-trained military officers. Thiswas the era of favoritism in the AFP. Gen. Romeo Espino, Ver's predecessor, was AFP Chief of Staff for the longest term in the Philippines military.
