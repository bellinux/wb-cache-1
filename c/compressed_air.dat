5000|$|The {{price of}} filling air powered {{vehicles}} is significantly cheaper than petrol, diesel or biofuel. If electricity is cheap, then <b>compressing</b> <b>air</b> {{will also be}} relatively cheap.|$|R
5|$|Many {{superficial}} inspections {{were performed}} on the locomotive in 1980 and it {{was found to be}} in relatively sound mechanical condition. There wasn't a significant amount of deterioration noted in these early inspections, and when the wheels were jacked off the rails, as they had been 50 years earlier, the axles were found to be freely operable. One morning in January 1980, before the museum opened to the public, museum officials used <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> to power the cylinders and move the wheels through the connecting rods {{for the first time since}} its last semi-operation. After the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> blew some dirt and debris out of the locomotive's exhaust stack, it was soon running smoothly.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the tunnel}} began on October 12, 1914, using a {{tunneling}} shield in conjunction with <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b> The tunnel was designed by civil engineer Clifford Milburn Holland, who later served as the first chief engineer of the Holland Tunnel. The north tube was holed through on November 28, 1916.|$|E
5|$|The Naval School, Diving and Salvage was re-established at the Washington Navy Yard in 1927, and the Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU) {{was moved}} to the same venue. In the {{following}} years, the Experimental Diving Unit developed the US Navy Air Decompression Tables, which became the accepted world standard for diving with <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E

50|$|Air {{compressors}}- Air compressors {{are another}} very popular turbomachine. They {{work on the}} principle of compression by sucking in and <b>compressing</b> <b>air</b> into a holding tank. Air compressors {{are one of the most}} basic turbomachines.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Toynbee maneuver": {{pinching}} {{the nose}} and swallowing. Swallowing pulls open the eustachian tubes while {{the movement of the}} tongue, with the nose closed, <b>compresses</b> <b>air</b> which passes through the tubes to the middle ear.|$|R
5|$|The lantern {{initially}} {{contained a}} fourth order Fresnel lens giving a red light; a short mast {{on the roof}} of the lantern bore a radio beacon antenna. The fog signal was a horn powered by <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b> The light was activated in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the night}} of 18April, Turret Two's crew {{conducted}} a major overhaul of their turret {{in preparation for a}} firing exercise scheduled to take place the next day. The center gun's <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> system, which cleansed the bore of sparks and debris each time the gun was fired, was not operating properly.|$|E
5|$|The main {{hydraulic}} system provided pressure for undercarriage raising and lowering and bogie trim; nosewheel centring and steering; wheelbrakes (fitted with Maxarets); bomb doors opening and closing; and (B.2 only) AAPP air scoop lowering. Hydraulic pressure {{was provided by}} three hydraulic pumps fitted to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines. An electrically operated hydraulic power pack (EHPP) {{could be used to}} operate the bomb doors and recharge the brake accumulators. A <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.|$|E
50|$|After {{the pump}} stroke, the shooter pulls the trigger, causing a spark and igniting the propane. The {{resulting}} expansion of gases forces a piston forward, {{which in turn}} <b>compresses</b> <b>air</b> behind the ball, propelling the paintball forward.|$|R
5000|$|In 1908 French {{inventor}} René Lorin proposed using a {{piston engine}} to <b>compress</b> <b>air</b> that {{would then be}} mixed with fuel and burned to produce pulses of hot gas that would be expelled through a nozzle to generate a propelling force.|$|R
3000|$|If [...] p_eap is fixed, the <b>compressed</b> <b>air’s</b> {{capability}} of doing work will decrease after throttling {{which results in}} lower efficiency of the RCAES system. The simulation result also indicates that the loss is larger when MWP of the CASV is higher.|$|R
5|$|The pulley {{system was}} {{eventually}} deemed unsafe due to instances of sagging and delayed reaction. As a result, it was replaced on 36engines by a safer <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> system between 1930 and 1937. This system had seen previous successful {{use on the}} LBSCR. Because the air compressor required extra space for installation, these conversions were confined to the long-framed members of the class.|$|E
5|$|At 04:40, HMAS Canberra {{recorded}} {{that the}} Japanese may have fired torpedoes at her. This {{may have been}} one of many false alarms throughout the night. However, M-21 had attempted to fire its two torpedoes, but failed because of damage to the bow either from HMAS Yandras ramming or depth charges, or a possible collision with USS Chicago, making it possible that M-21 attempted to attack the cruiser. The observer aboard Canberra may have seen bubbles from the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> released to fire the torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Computers may be {{impacted}} by volcanic ash, with their functionality and usability decreasing during ashfall, {{but it is}} unlikely they will completely fail. The most vulnerable components are the mechanical components, such as cooling fans, cd drives, keyboard, mice and touch pads. These components can become jammed with fine grained ash causing them to cease working; however, most can be restored to working order by cleaning with <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b> Moist ash may cause electrical short circuits within desktop computers; however, will not affect laptop computers.|$|E
50|$|A Natterer {{compressor}} was {{a type of}} {{air compression}} machine which was used in early experiments in making liquid oxygen (LOX) in the 1870s. A manually operated screw jack was utilized to <b>compress</b> <b>air</b> or other gases up to ~200 atm (~3000 psi).|$|R
5000|$|She {{has also}} used her powers {{to create a}} [...] "cutting" [...] effect by {{refining}} {{the force of the}} wind. When at close range, she can also <b>compress</b> <b>air</b> into a person's ear to disrupt their middle ear's equilibrium thereby disturbing their balance.|$|R
2500|$|The time {{required}} to refill a depleted tank is important for vehicle applications. [...] "Volume transfer" [...] moves pre-compressed air from a stationary tank to the vehicle tank almost instantaneously. Alternatively, a stationary or on-board compressor can <b>compress</b> <b>air</b> on demand, possibly requiring several hours.|$|R
5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} the study and {{modelling}} of {{the transfer of the}} inert gas component of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the tissues of the diver and back during exposure to variations in ambient pressure. In the case of underwater diving and <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> work, this mostly involves ambient pressures greater than the local surface pressure—but astronauts, high altitude mountaineers, and occupants of unpressurized aircraft, are exposed to ambient pressures less than standard sea level atmospheric pressure. In all cases, the symptoms of decompression sickness occur during or within {{a relatively short period of}} hours, or occasionally days, after a significant reduction of ambient pressure.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{should only}} be filled with suitably filtered air from diving air compressors or with other breathing gases using gas blending or decanting techniques. In some jurisdictions, suppliers of breathing gases are required by legislation to periodically test the quality of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> produced by their equipment and to display the test results for public information. The standards for industrial gas purity and filling equipment and procedures may allow some contaminants at levels unsafe for breathing, and their use in breathing gas mixtures at high pressure could be harmful or fatal.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{starting}} {{was achieved}} {{by a combination of}} <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and a hand-turned magneto; however, starting problems were encountered during pre-race testing at Calshot due to moisture in the air and water contamination of the fuel. A complicated test procedure was devised to ensure clean fuel for competition flights since more than 0.3% water content made it unusable. As expected, minor engine failures continued to be experienced, and to counter this engines and parts were transported at high speed between Derby and Calshot using an adapted Rolls-Royce Phantom I motor car. Travelling mostly after dark, this vehicle became known as the Phantom of The Night.|$|E
25|$|As {{explained}} in the thermodynamics of gas storage section above, <b>compressing</b> <b>air</b> heats it and expanding it cools it. Therefore, practical air engines require heat exchangers {{in order to avoid}} excessively high or low temperatures and even so don't reach ideal constant temperature conditions, or ideal thermal insulation.|$|R
50|$|Energy can {{be stored}} in water pumped to a higher {{elevation}} using pumped storage methods and also by moving solid matter to higher locations. Other commercial mechanical methods include <b>compressing</b> <b>air</b> and flywheels that convert electric energy into kinetic energy and then back again when electrical demand peaks.|$|R

5|$|In 1928, {{a man in}} Portland, Oregon, invented an {{electric}} pancake machine that operated {{by the process of}} batter being dropped onto a revolving heated flattop grill from a storage cylinder atop the grill. The grill was heated using electricity. The amount of batter dropped was controlled by using controlled amounts of <b>compressed</b> <b>air,</b> which pushed batter out of the storage cylinder. As the batter revolved on the hot grill, the pancake was flipped halfway through the cooking process by a shelf atop the grill. After being flipped, the completed pancake was ejected from the machine upon contact with a gate.|$|E
5|$|In October, {{the second}} unit {{travelled}} to Nassau to film the underwater sequences. To perform the car becoming a submarine, seven different models were used, {{one for each}} step of the transformation. One of the models was a fully mobile submarine equipped with an engine built by Miami-based Perry Submarines. The car seen entering the sea was a mock-up shell, propelled off the jetty by a <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cannon. During the model sequences, the air bubbles seen appearing from the vehicle were created by Alka-Seltzer tablets.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{industrial}} whaling, great whales {{may have been the}} major food source for killer whales. The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided killer whales by the sound of exploding harpoons indicating availability of prey to scavenge, and <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the toll on great whale populations by unfettered whaling had possibly reduced their availability as prey for killer whales, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to their decline as well.|$|E
