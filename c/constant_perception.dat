[...] With {{which he had}} it again all from her--and this time, as it seemed to him, more than all: the dishonour her father had brought them, his folly and cruelty and wickedness; the wounded state of her mother, abandoned, despoiled and helpless, yet, for the {{management}} of such a home as remained to them, dreadfully unreasonable too; the extinction of her two young brothers--one, at nineteen, the eldest of the house, by typhoid fever, contracted at a poisonous little place, as they had afterwards found out, that they had taken for a summer; the other, the flower of the flock, a middy on the Britannia, dreadfully drowned, and not even by an accident at sea, but by cramp, unrescued, while bathing, too late in the autumn, in a wretched little river during a holiday visit to the home of a shipmate. Then Marian's unnatural marriage, in itself a kind of spiritless turning of the other cheek to fortune: her actual wretchedness and plaintiveness, her greasy children, her impossible claims, her odious visitors--these things completed the proof of the heaviness, for them all, of the hand of fate. Kate confessedly described them with an excess of impatience; it was much of her charm for Densher that she gave in general that turn to her descriptions, partly as if to amuse him by free and humorous colour, partly--and that charm was the greatest--as if to work off, for her own relief, her <b>constant</b> <b>perception</b> of the incongruity of things. She had seen the general show too early and too sharply, and she was so intelligent that she knew it and allowed for that misfortune; therefore when, in talk with him, she was violent and almost unfeminine, {{it was almost as if}} they had settled, for intercourse, on the short cut of the fantastic and the happy language of exaggeration. It had come to be definite between them at a primary stage that, if they could have no other straight way, the realm of thought at least was open to them. They could think whatever they liked about whatever they would--or, in other words, they could say it. Saying it for each other, for each other alone, only of course added to the taste. The implication was thereby constant that what they said when not together had no taste for them at all, and nothing could have served more to launch them, at special hours, on their small floating island than such an assumption that they were only making believe everywhere else. Our young man, it must be added, was conscious enough that it was Kate who profited most by this particular play of the fact of intimacy. It always seemed to him that she had more life than he to react from, and when she recounted the dark disasters of her house and glanced at the hard, odd offset of her present exaltation--since as exaltation it was apparently to be considered--he felt his own grey domestic annals to make little show. It was naturally, in all such reference, the question of her father's character that engaged him most, but her picture of her adventure in Chirk Street gave him a sense of how little as yet that character was clear to him. What was it, to speak plainly, that Mr. Croy had originally done? ...|$|E

40|$|It {{is natural}} {{to think that}} in perceiving dynamic scenes, vision takes a series of snapshots. Motion {{perception}} can ensue when the snapshots are different. The snapshot metaphor suggests two questions: (i) How does the visual system put together elements within each snapshot to form objects? This is the spatial grouping problem. (ii) When the snapshots are different, how does the visual system know which element in one snapshot corresponds to which element in the next? This is the temporal grouping problem. The snapshot metaphor is a caricature of the dominant model in the field—the sequential model—according to which spatial and temporal grouping are independent. The model we propose here is an interactive model, according to which the two grouping mechanisms are not separable. Currently, the experiments that support the interactive model are not conclusive because they use stimuli that are excessively specialized. To overcome this weakness, we created {{a new type of}} stimulus—spatiotemporal dot lattices—which allow us to independently manipulate the strength of spatial and temporal groupings. For these stimuli, sequential models make one fundamental assumption: if the spatial configuration of the stimulus remains <b>constant,</b> the <b>perception</b> of spatial grouping cannot be affected by manipulations of the temporal configuration of the stimulus. Our data are inconsistent with this assumption...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Linear {{acceleration}} generally {{gives rise}} to translation perception. Centripetal acceleration during centrifugation, however, has never been reported giving rise to a radial, inward translation perception. OBJECTIVE: To study whether centrifugation can induce a radial translation perception {{in the absence of}} visual cues. METHODS: To that end, we exposed 12 subjects to a centripetal acceleration with eyes closed. To avoid confounding with angular motion perception, subjects were fist rotated on-axis, and were shifted out fast and slow only after rotation sensation had vanished. They were asked for translation direction and velocity right after the shift-out, as well as after about 60 seconds of constant centrifugation. RESULTS: Independent of fast or slow shift-out, the vast statistically significant majority of trials yielded an inward radial translation perception, which velocity was constant after 60 seconds of constant centrifugation. CONCLUSIONS: We therefore conclude that during centrifugation, an inward radial translation perception does exist in humans, which <b>perception</b> reaches a <b>constant,</b> non-zero value during constant rotation, lasting for at least one minute. These results can be understood by high-pass filtering of otolith afferents to make a distinction between inertial and gravitational acceleration, followed by a mere integration over time to reach a <b>constant</b> velocity <b>perception...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recently, haptic {{devices have}} been {{successfully}} incorporated into the human-computer interaction model. However, a drawback common to almost all haptic systems is that the user must {{be attached to the}} haptic device at all times, even though force feedback is not always being rendered. This <b>constant</b> contact hinders <b>perception</b> of the virtual environment, primarily because it prevents the user from feeling new tactile sensations upon contact with virtual objects. We present the design and implementation of an augmented reality system called VisHap that uses visual tracking to seamlessly integrate force feedback with tactile feedback to generate a “complete ” haptic experience. The VisHap framework allows the user to interact with combinations of virtual and real objects naturally, thereby combining active and passive haptics. An example application of this framework is also presented. The flexibility and extensibility of our framework is promising in that it supports many interaction modes and allows further integration with other augmented reality systems. ...|$|R
30|$|Newel {{proposed}} a microscopic traffic model and acknowledged {{for the first}} time that the distance headways varies during traffic harmonization [4], but the variable distances between vehicles were not explained [5]. The General Motors model indicates that the distance headway between vehicles increases with velocity. However, this model ignores the variable distances between vehicles at slow speeds [6, 7]. Gipps characterized variable distance headways using a safety rule [8]. According to this model, the distance headways between vehicles should be sufficient to decelerate and harmonize speeds. However, the behavior of the driver population on the distance headway was not considered. Wiedemann {{proposed a}} psychophysical model to characterize individual driver behavior based on conscious and unconscious reaction and perception [9]. Drivers unconsciously harmonize small changes in speed for small distance headways, so the reaction of these drivers is slow. Conversely, with large distance headways, drivers consciously harmonize speeds with large reactions and perceptions. The limitations of the Wiedemann model are the <b>constant</b> ranges for <b>perception</b> and reaction which actually vary depending on the speed harmonization [10].|$|R

40|$|Attention modulates {{auditory}} perception, {{but there}} are currently no simple tests that specifically quantify this modulation. To fill the gap, we developed a new, easy-to-use test of attention in listening (TAIL) based on reaction time. On each trial, two clearly audible tones were presented sequentially, either at the same or different ears. The frequency of the tones was also either the same or different (by at least two critical bands). When the task required same/different frequency judgments, presentation at the same ear significantly speeded responses and reduced errors. A same/different ear (location) judgment was likewise facilitated by keeping tone frequency <b>constant.</b> <b>Perception</b> was thus influenced by involuntary orienting of attention along the task-irrelevant dimension. When information in the two stimulus dimensions were congruent (same-frequency same-ear, or different-frequency different-ear), response was faster and more accurate than when they were incongruent (same-frequency different-ear, or different-frequency same-ear), suggesting the involvement of executive control to resolve conflicts. In total, the TAIL yielded five independent outcome measures: (1) baseline reaction time, indicating information processing efficiency, (2) involuntary orienting of attention to frequency and (3) location, and (4) conflict resolution for frequency and (5) location. Processing efficiency and conflict resolution accounted for up to 45 % of individual variances in the low- and high-threshold variants of three psychoacoustic tasks assessing temporal and spectral processing.

40|$|Simulation {{results of}} {{bistable}} perception due to ambiguous visual stimuli are presented which are obtained with a behavioral nonlinear dynamics model using perception–attention– memory (PAM) coupling. It predicts long range correlations of the perceptual duration times {{in agreement with}} recent experimental results of Gao et al. (2006) via determination of the self similarity (Hurst) parameter H (Kettani and Gubner 2006) of the reversal time series. The basic model couples the dynamics of a macroscopic perception state order parameter with an adaptive attention (feedback gain) control parameter with additive band limited white noise (Fürstenau 2006). A minimum formal architecture is proposed which allows for mapping of macroscopic thalamo-cortical structures relevant for perception and attention control (Itti and Koch 2001) onto a simple nonlinear dynamical system (three coupled differential–delay equations representing PAM). Quasiperiodic perceptual reversals are induced by attention satiation (fatigue) with a perception bias which balances the relative duration, i. e. the relative preference of the different percepts. Memory effects are introduced by allowing for the adaptation of the originally <b>constant</b> <b>perception</b> bias parameter. Hurst parameter values of perception reversal time series exhibit significant long range correlations (H > 0. 5) in the simulations when coupling the bias parameter to the perception state, i. e. allowing for memory and learning. The coupled attention–perception dynamics reproduces the experimentally observed Gamma-distribution of the reversal time statistics. Mean reversal times of typically 3 – 5 s {{as reported in the}} literature, are correctly predicted if delay T is associated with the latency of 30 - 40 ms between stimulus onset and V 1 /V 2 visual cortex response. Numerically determined perceptual transition times of 3 – 5 T are in reasonable agreement with stimulus – conscious perception delay of 150 – 200 ms. The rescaled absolute value of the attention parameter exhibits good agreement with the dynamics of the eye blink rate as reported by Ito et. al. (2003) ...|$|E

The two types of scale are characterized by a different relationship between the items: for the Likert scale they are independent, {{in the sense that the}} responses are not connected, whilst for the one hundred sum scale the responses are interconnected.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 This {{thesis is}} a work of {{literary}} criticism, specifically eco-criticism, of the non-fiction book 'Green Alaska: Dreams from the Far Coast' by Alaskan writer Nancy Lord. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the literary techniques employed by Lord in her representation of nature in this book. Furthermore, the purpose of this thesis is to present Lord's book to the critical field in order to open a discussion of her work among other critics. It is argued that Lord uses the multiple meanings of the word 'green' and multiple perspectives concerning nature to complicate perspectives and perceptions of nature in order to develop a more responsible view towards the world. Some of these variant meanings of green nature are green money, green envy, and green naïveté. Because Nancy Lord provides multiple voices and interpretations of nature in Green Alaska, no single definition or <b>perception</b> can remain <b>constant,</b> and common <b>perceptions</b> and definitions of nature must be reconsidered. This exploration of various meanings creates a need for introspection. The important question becomes not 'What does green mean?' but 'Why does green mean whatever meaning we choose to assign it?'

40|$|Illusions {{provide a}} window into the brain’s perceptual strategies. In certain illusions, an ostensibly task-irrelevant {{variable}} influences perception. For example, in touch as in audition and vision, the perceived distance between successive punctate stimuli reflects not only the actual distance but curiously the inter-stimulus time. Stimuli presented at different positions in rapid succession are drawn perceptually towards one another. This effect manifests in several illusions, among them the startling cutaneous rabbit, in which taps delivered to as few as two skin positions appear to hop progressively from one position to the next, landing in the process on intervening areas that were never stimulated. Here we provide an accessible step-by-step exposition of a Bayesian perceptual model that replicates the rabbit and related illusions. The Bayesian observer optimally joins uncertain estimates of spatial location with the expectation that stimuli tend to move slowly. We speculate that this expectation – a Bayesian prior – represents the statistics of naturally occurring stimuli, learned by humans through sensory experience. In its simplest form, the model contains a single free parameter, tau: a time <b>constant</b> for space <b>perception.</b> We show that the Bayesian observer incorporates both pre- and post-dictive inference. Directed spatial attention affects the prediction-postdiction balance, shifting the model’s percept towards the attended location, as observed experimentally in humans. Applying the model to the perception of multi-tap sequences, we show that the low-speed prior fits perception better than an alternative, low-acceleration prior. We discuss the applicability of our model to related tactile, visual, and auditory illusions. To facilitate future model-driven experimental studies, we present a convenient freeware computer program that implements the Bayesian observer; we invite investigators to use this program to create their own testable predictions...|$|R
40|$|Room {{reverberation}} adds slowly-decaying 'tails' {{at the end}} of sounds, yet listeners do {{not perceive}} these strongly. This is evinced by loudness judgements of stimuli shaped with 'reverberant tail-like' slow offsets being quieter than their reversed counterparts. This study investigates whether a perceptual 'constancy' mechanism is responsible, accounting for reverberation effects and maintaining <b>constant</b> <b>perception</b> despite changes to the sound's physical characteristics. Such a mechanism might take account of reverberation by separating sounds with decaying rails into source characteristics and effects from reverberation, then dismissing energy within tails from listeners' loudness judgements. The process appears to be informed by preceding contexts because loudness differences are enhanced following 'standard' stimuli with similar tail• like decays. This study found that this 'loudness context effect' is more pronounced when using stimuli with real• reverberant tails than artificially-shaped offsets, indicating the effect is sensitive to more than simplified slow offsets. Additionally, reverberation decorrelates sounds at a listener's two ears. When binaural and monaural conditions are examined, a 'binaural de-reverberation' occurs whereby perception of uncorrelated binaural tails is further reduced, causing a decrease in the loudness context effect. However, the loudness context effect is only apparent in situations where both standard and test stimuli occupy the same narrow frequency band and is markedly reduced in widely separated cross-band conditions. These monaural and within• band loudness effects are similar to a constancy for reverberation found in speech perception in which reverberant tails are also dismissed. The underlying processes causing these effects are explored. While models of the early auditory system can account for some of these loudness differences, such models are insensitive to additional influence from contexts. It seems a further, higher-level process may be having an effect: one that uses information from previously heard stimuli, such as the presence of similarly tailed decays, binaural comparisons, and stimuli sharing a common frequencyEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Introduction One of {{the most}} {{fascinating}} problems in visual neuroscience is finding a direct relationship between brain activity and perception. When a visual stimulus is presented to the eyes, it elicits a series of responses in many and different parts of the visual system, from the retina to the ’higher’ cortical areas, leading to a conscious visual percept. Dissociating which part of the visual brain activity is reflecting our perception is thus hard, since at the same time this activity {{is directly related to the}} processing of the visual stimulus itself. To try and answer this question, binocular rivalry has been used in the past, where the stimulus (which is different for each eye) remains <b>constant</b> but the <b>perception</b> alternates between the two rivalring monocular inputs. In this way one can dissociate the stimulus from the percept and, by studying the alternations in brain activation under such conditions, get an insight into which brain areas correlate their activity with what the subject actually perceives. Methods Binocular rivalry was used in fMRI experiments that were performed on a Siemens Trio 3 T system. A different random dot kinematogram was shown to each eye, one consisting of red and the other of green dots. In one of the kinematograms 50 of the dots moved in the same direction producing a coherent motion signal whereas in the other all dots moved in random directions thus producing pure motion noise. As binocular rivalry developed between red dots in one eye and green dots in the other, subjects inside the scanner used two different buttons to report whether they perceived one the another color. In this way we could relate the BOLD signal we recorded in the magnet to the subjects’ percept and investigate how motion perception is reflected in the cortical activation of the various visual areas. Results Averaging the event-related time-courses across all subjects showed a range of different responses, with no significant effect in areas V 1, V 2 and V 4, only a slight difference in area V 3, and a much more clear difference in areas V 3 a, V 5 and LOC (Fig. 1). Discussion In this study we were able to show that a number of visual areas are involved in motion perception. In general, the more involved an area is in motion processing, the more it is modulated by motion perception, supporting the idea that processing and perceptual areas are not distinct and separable, but rather the same areas are involved in both processing and perception...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores current {{ideas about}} {{children}} and childhood in Britain through {{an examination of}} empowerment, play and learning as identified by policies, professional playworkers, and adult and child service users in two State run after school provisions in a London borough. Conducted in two quite different physical and social environments, the primary research involved an ethnographic study during the academic year 2007 to 2008, based on participant observation and interviews with managers, playworkers, parents and children at both sites. The research found strong connections between playworkers’ attitudes to children’s play, learning and empowerment, and their descriptions of their own priorities and responsibilities. That play and activity were occurring in supervised, closed access, paid-for settings meant that free play and regulation of behaviour were held in <b>constant</b> dynamic tension. <b>Perceptions</b> of playworker’s jobs as both controlling children’s behaviour and facilitating their play highlighted ambiguities inherent in these contexts and produced tensions felt by playworkers and children. Though masquerading as mechanisms for each child’s individual development and fulfilment, play, informal learning and empowerment were imbued with strategic endeavours to steer children’s experiences in particular directions. Furthermore, these ideas and their related practices were understood and implemented differently in the two after school settings. The research focus evolved {{to look at the}} impacts of social constructions of children and childhood on playworkers’ practices and children’s experiences. Far from being fixed concepts whose meanings were consistent over time and contexts, ideas about play, learning, empowerment, children and childhood all referred, in fact, to fundamentally dynamic social processes that this thesis reveals and explores. Two key aspects of the complex meanings attached to children and their childhoods emerged. Firstly, the child and childhood are ‘relational’ concepts (Aries 1962) or ‘conceptions’ (Wyness 2000), fluid in their meanings yet constant in their social significance. Secondly, social constructions of childhood can only adequately be understood in their real life social, economic and political contexts (Hendrick 1997 a: 35). Reflecting both recent and more conventional ideas, playworkers presented contrasting constructions of the children as victims and products of their social circumstances with predictable futures, or as rights bearers and social agents with a say in their current and future possibilities. The ways in which playworkers controlled or facilitated the children were tied in with these ideas and a matrix of intersecting influences impacting on their confidence, trust and skills - as individuals and as teams - in allowing children to direct their own play activities and to deal with issues. This thesis contributes to gaps in current knowledge and understanding about notions of the child and childhood operating in playwork settings and the effects of these on practices and experiences in these contexts...|$|R
