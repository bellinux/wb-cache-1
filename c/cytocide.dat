40|$|Die Bearbeitung einer Reihe von Problemstellungen der experimentellen und klinischen Krebsforschung setzt die Möglichkeit einer Synchronisation proliferierender Zellsysteme in vivo voraus. Dies gilt z. B. für die Frage, ob bei Säugerzellen als Funktion ihrer Position im Zellcyclus Empfindlichkeitsunterschiede vorhanden sind, und zwar sowohl hinsichtlich der Auslösbarkeit des Prozesses der malignen Transformation durch Cancerogene, als auch in bezug auf die Inaktivierbarkeit maligner Zellen durch <b>cytocide</b> Agentien oder ionisierende Strahlung. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird über Untersuchungen zur in vivo-Synchronisation verschiedener Gewebe (Embryo; Leber; Milz; transplantabler BICR/M 1 R-Tumor) der Ratte durch temporäre Blockade der DNA-Synthese mit Hydroxyharnstoff (HU) berichtet. The {{synchronous}} {{passage of}} proliferating cells through defined {{phases of the}} cell cycle {{is a prerequisite for}} the study of a number of problems associated with carcinogenesis and cancer therapy. It is particularly required for investigations of the differential sensitivity of mammalian cells in specific phases of the cell cycle to agents capable of initiating the process of malignant transformation, or causing cell death. The present study is concerned with the in vivo synchronisation of different rat tissues (embryo; liver; spleen; transplantable BICR/M 1 R tumor) by temporary specific inhibition of DNA synthesis with hydroxyurea (HU) ...|$|E
40|$|Modulation of {{myelopoiesis}} by {{chemically pure}} preparations of different cell wall components from gram-negative bacteria {{was investigated in}} vivo. The effects of lipid A, outer membrane lipoprotein, and murein were evaluated at several distinct stages: induction of colony-stimulating activity (CSA) in the serum, {{increase in the number}} of committed splenic precursor cells (CFU-C) forming granulocyte-macrophage colonies in vitro, and triggering into the cell cycle of noncommitted hemopoietic stem cells (CFU-S) from bone marrow. The results reveal different patterns of activity of the bacterial cell wall components (BCWC) tested. (i) In C 57 Bl/ 6 mice and C 3 H/Bom mice, all three preparations were potent inducers of CSA. In C 3 H/HeJ mice, CSA was only induced by lipoprotein and murein and not by lipid A. After injection of lipid A or lipoprotein, but not murein, the number of CFU-C in spleens of C 57 Bl/ 6 mice was increased up to 100 -fold. In C 3 H/Bom and C 3 H/HeJ mice, not only murein but also lipoprotein were much less potent in this respect. (iii) In C 57 Bl/ 6 mice, both lipid A and lipoprotein, but not murein, were capable of inducing the proliferation of CFU-S, as demonstrated by a hot thymidine <b>cytocide</b> technique. Thus, induction of CSA and changes in the pool size of splenic CFU-C after administration of BCWC may be unrelated events. On the other hand, the increase of CFU-C might reflect the mitogenicity of BCWC for CFU-S...|$|E
40|$|Graded {{numbers of}} bone marrow (BM) cells were {{injected}} into fatally irradiated mice. Eight {{days later the}} mice were given 3. 0 microCi (1 Ci = 3. 7 X 10 (10) Bq) of 125 IdUrd to label proliferating cells in the spleen and BM. On day 9 the mice were killed and the spleens and femurs were removed for splenic colony assay and measurement of radioactivity in the spleen and femurs. The number of splenic colonies shows a linear relationship with dose of marrow cells injected from 10 (4) to 10 (5) cells. The slope of the curve of spleen colonies versus number of cells injected is less than 1, implying that the fraction seeded in spleen decreases with number of cells injected. Above 10 (5) and below 10 (4) there is a striking departure from the simple linearity. Below 2 X 10 (3) cells injected, the logarithm of the observed colony yield is linear with logarithm {{of the number of}} cells injected. Poisson calculation of the average number of pluripotent stem cells that should be present with numbers of marrow cells injected below 2 X 10 (3) followed closely the actual observations. The data show that there is no detectible proliferation in the BM until the dose of marrow cells exceeds 3. 5 X 10 (4) cells. Induction of cells into cycle increases the seeding into the BM, and thymidine <b>cytocide</b> drastically reduces seeding in the BM, leading us to conclude that the BM is repopulated almost exclusively by stem cells in DNA synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Primary Epstein-Barr virus {{infection}} (EBVI) {{in children}} is usually asymptomatic with seroconversion. If primary infection occurs in adolescents or in adulthood, {{the most common}} manifestation is acute infectious mononucleosis. The diagnosis of acute infectious mononucleosis is made by virus and serologic tests. The most important evidence of primary EBV infection includes IgM class antibodies detected by using EBV virus-capsidantigen (EBV VCA) which appears {{at the beginning of}} illness and usually lasts 1 to 2 months. Paul Bunnell Davidson test, although non-specific, is still in use today in diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis and for detection of heterophile antibodies. Case report. Acute hepatitis with icterus is a rare clinical manifestation in primary EBV infection. However, sometimes it is the only manifestation of the disease. This is a case report of a patient with EBV hepatitis and icterus associated with long-lasting fever without pharyngitis and lymphadenopathy, which are characteristics of infectious mononucleosis. The etiologic diagnosis was confirmed by positive Paul Bunnell Davidson test and by detection of specific antibodies (class IgM) to EBV VCA in patient's serum. Discussion. The pathogenetic mechanism which causes destruction of hepatic cells and provokes cholestasis during EBV infection, has not been cleared yet. It is supposed that EBV has no direct <b>cytocide</b> effects on hepatic cells, yet destruction of these cells is caused by toxic action of free radicals through lipid peroxidation. Patients with infectious mononucleosis have autoantibodies directed against enzyme superoxide-dismutase which neutralizes enzyme's antioxidant action. As a result of this action, free radicals accumulate in hepatic cells and cause their damage. Conclusion. Icteric forms of EBV infection are rare. In differential diagnosis of icterus caused by infectious agents, one should not forget EBV. ...|$|E
