5000|$|<b>Coulometers</b> {{can be used}} to {{determine}} electric quantities in the direct current circuit, namely the total charge or a constant current. These devices invented by Michael Faraday were used frequently in the 19th century and {{in the first half of}} the 20th century.

5000|$|The {{electronic}} <b>coulometer</b> {{is based}} on the application of the operational amplifier in the [...] "integrator"-type circuit. The current passed through the resistor R1 makes a potential drop which is integrated by operational amplifier on the capacitor plates; the higher current, the larger the potential drop. The current need not be constant. In such scheme Vout is proportional of the passed charge. Sensitivity of the <b>coulometer</b> can be changed by choosing of the appropriate value of R1.|$|E

50|$|This <b>coulometer</b> has {{different}} constructions {{but all of}} them are based on mass measurements. One of the most significant construction is shown on the picture. It consists of two reservoirs connected by a thin graduated capillary tube. All system contains solution of the mercury(II)-ions solution. Each of the reservoirs have an electrode immersed into a drop of mercury. Another small drop of mercury is inserted into the capillary. When the current is turned on, it will initiate dissolution of the metallic mercury on the one side of the drop in the capillary and deposition {{on the other side of}} the same drop. This drop starts to move. Because of the 100% efficiency of the deposition/dissolution of the mercury under the current influence, mass or volume of this small drop will be a constant and its movement will be linearly correlated with the passed charge. If the direction of the current is changed, the drop starts move in the opposite direction. Sensitivity of this type of coulometers depends on the diameter of the capillary.|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} several types of coulometers {{available}} for use in electrochemical works. Among them conventional silver <b>coulometer,</b> water <b>coulometer</b> and copper <b>coulometer</b> have long been used mostly for a rather large quantity of electricity, but they fail to insure the accuracy and precision required in an eleborate work involving less than several coulombs of electricity. Those coulometers that require titrations at the final step, despite the convenience to manage, depend on the accuracy and precision of the titration involved. While several type of mechanical current integrators have been published, the coulometric <b>coulometer</b> by Ehlers and Sease seems to be reliable enough among chemical coulometers, except that a special equipment is needed as the trigger. Franklin and Roth previously reported a colorimetric <b>coulometer,</b> utilizing the change of an indicator color. The method, though it is suitable for precise measurement of a small quantity of electricity, contains the ambiguity of indefinite starting point and has a limited range as for the quantity of electricity. In this connection the present author has exte nded his earlier work of measuring ionic strength {{to this type of}} <b>coulometer.</b> In his preceding paper the author proposed an electrolytical method to measure the ionic strength of aqueous solutions, in which the linear relationsphip of the absorbance ratio of acid and alkaline absorption peaks of bromophenol blue vs. quantity of electricity was used.

50|$|KF {{has a high}} {{accuracy}} and precision, typically within 1% of available water, e.g. 3.00% appears as 2.97 - 3.03%. Although KF is a destructive analysis, the sample quantity is small and is typically limited by the accuracy of weighing. For example, {{in order to obtain}} an accuracy of 1% using a scale with the typical accuracy of 0.2 mg, the sample must contain 20 mg water, which is e.g. 200 mg for a sample with 10% water. For <b>coulometers,</b> the measuring range is from 1-5 ppm to ca. 5%. Volumetric KF readily measures samples up to 100%, but requires impractically large amounts of sample for analytes with less than 0.05% water. The KF response is linear. Therefore, single-point calibration using a calibrated 1% water standard is sufficient and no calibration curves are necessary.|$|R

The original objective was successfully achieved by measuring the first in-flight average leakage current through the samples. Less than 5 percent of the post-flight <b>coulometers</b> behaved anomalously. The data should be valuable to the design and evaluation of spacecraft with high voltage systems. M/D (micrometeoroid and debris) impacts over the dielectric samples were examined using a SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) and an EDS (Energy Dispersive x-ray Spectrometer).

Each instrument contains a silicon photodiode and a <b>coulometer.</b> The photocharge generated in the photodiode is stored in the <b>coulometer.</b> The accumulated electric charge measured by use of the <b>coulometer</b> is assumed to be proportional to the cumulative dose of VUV radiation expressed in such convenient units as equivalent Sun hours (ESH) [defined as the number of hours of exposure to sunlight at normal incidence]. Intended originally for use aboard spacecraft, these instruments could also be adapted to such terrestrial uses as monitoring the curing of ultraviolet-curable epoxies. Each instrument includes a photodiode and a <b>coulometer</b> assembly mounted on an interface plate (see figure). The photodiode assembly includes an aluminum housing that holds the photodiode, a poly(tetrafluoroehylene) cosine receptor, and a narrow-band optical filter.
