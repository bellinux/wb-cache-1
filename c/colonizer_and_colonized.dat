The security forces resort to lynch mobs and indiscriminate violence against the opposition. French paratroops are depicted as routinely using torture, intimidation, and murder. Pontecorvo and Solinas have several protagonists, based on historical war figures.

40|$|Abstract—Based on Homi K. Bhabha's postcolonial theory, the {{relationship}} between the <b>colonizer</b> <b>and</b> the <b>colonized</b> is the mutual relationship in which the identities of the <b>colonizer</b> <b>and</b> the <b>colonized</b> (the Other) are mutually constructed. In Bhabha's sense, neither the colonizer nor the colonized has the absolute power over the other in the Third Space and both parties desire to become almost the same as the other but not quite the same. This paper tries to investigate how Song and Gallimard—the ostensibly Oriental <b>colonized</b> <b>and</b> the Western colonizer—respond to this colonial desire throughout the play. This paper also studies the <b>colonizer's</b> Oriental suicide <b>and</b> the reason that the colonial relationship is terminated, in the light of Bhabha's idea of the satisfaction of the colonial desire...|$|R

40|$|The author, {{speaking}} as a Mozambican researcher {{living and working}} in Portugal, examines the different types of knowledge {{about the history of the}} colonial relationship and the independence movement produced in the two countries. The colonial project entailed the construction of (at least) two divergent narratives on the meanings of the Portuguese presence in Mozambique, narratives that render difficult any possibility of mutual recognition. Colonialism involved much forgetting and silencing; the dominant Eurocentric perspective on colonial history needs to be questioned and problematized. This is not contradictory with a critical questioning of the official post-colonial narrative of the independent Mozambican state, whose nationbuilding function caused it to silence the diversity of memories generated by the interaction between <b>colonizers</b> <b>and</b> <b>colonized</b> <b>and</b> to justify the repression of those who questioned the official version of history. Public narratives, official or otherwise, that construct or reconstruct memories are inevitably in competition with each other and reflect power relations. But the full plurality of memory does not receive public attention; it must be dug out by activist researchers who are able to distinguish subject and object and to produce knowledge in full understanding of the complex relations created by historical legacies.

The objective of this critical essay is to present an historical analysis of this evolution over the last 60 years. To do so we characterize and analyze two periods: 1950 - 1980, which we call colonization; and 1980 - 2010, which we call neo-colonization. For each period we present {{the political and economic}} context, the changes that occurred in human resource management and the corresponding discourse. Our analysis adopts the perspective of post-colonialism, a rising tide in research in organizational studies, and introduces and uses the perspective of tropicalism, a genuinely local approach, which is derived from the cultural movements of the 1960 s. We argue that human resource management developed in Brazil from a colonization movement that came from abroad. This movement, which involved both <b>colonizers</b> <b>and</b> <b>colonized,</b> comprised asymmetries in terms of power, but also included interdependence and re-creation...|$|R

An examination of repartimiento {{through the lens of}} New Institutional Econom-ics provides an alternative understanding of this credit system. Characteristics of the repartimiento most often identified as exploitative are better explained as in-stitutional adaptations designed to facilitate contract enforcement and economize on transaction costs in this cross-cultural trade. Consequently, this peculiar co-lonial institution served to expand trade. olonial historians are confronted with peculiar institutions and prac-tices that emerge to articulate and negotiate the complex relations between <b>colonizer</b> <b>and</b> <b>colonized.</b> Many such practices are imposed by the colonial power, and whereas they might be manipulated and re-formed by the colonial subjects, they nonetheless reflect the inequality of power and exchange upon which the system of colonialism is predi-cated. But institutions serve much more complex purposes than merely reinforcing colonial domination and assisting the exploitation of the colonized. Institutions also seek to erode barriers and to facilitate the transference of ideas, laws, culture and goods. Historians of Spanish America have traditionally emphasized the ex-ploitative nature of the economic institutions of the Spanish colonial world, presenting them foremost as devices designed to extract the wealth of the colony’s indigenous subjects. One of the practices that historians most condemn in the late colonial era is the repartimiento de bienes, 1 often held up as the prime example of a highly exploitative an...|$|E

40|$|The work of Frantz Fanon {{is highly}} {{influential}} {{on the academic}} discipline of post-colonial studies, and during the time Fanon was writing, there were numerous decolonizing movements from nations that are now referred to as belonging to the “developing world”.

Hudson’s Green Mansions (1904) {{the mysterious}} and enchanting {{quality of the}} natural world is {{represented}} through the writer’s powerful imagination, and the exotic landscape of the South American rainforest is related to British territorial expansion: according to a long-standing literary tradition, the European colonial desire is projected onto remote, unknown places. On the one hand, the pristine forest appears a pure space, a site unspoiled by colonial expansion, the primitive and sacred world nourishing Western exotic dreams. On the other hand, by revisiting the myth of the lost paradise, Hudson conveys the late nineteenth-early twentieth century European perception of the tropical world, a patchwork of Charles Darwin’s theories, Biblical echoes and colonial ideology. Abel surrenders to the influence of the wild, ventures into the weird and entangled forest, seemingly refusing male invasion and domination. Rima’s subsequent death symbolizes the ecological catastrophe brought about by the Europeans in the primitive world of South America: the feathered bird-girl is assimilated to an Edenic being at the mercy of destructive forces. At the same time, Abel’s wish to possess the land reinforces the colonial viewpoint of the narration, while the movement from civilization to the wilderness implies the representation of a Darwinian struggle. Hudson frames the tropical space as substantially ambiguous, attractive and destructive for both <b>colonizers</b> <b>and</b> <b>colonized,</b> <b>and</b> through his narrative he introduces the fear of natural loss in the extreme form of the extinction of the green world. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{working paper}} {{deals with the}} making of the African elite in late colonial Belgian Congo and the role of {{cultural}} embourgeoisement in negotiating its place in the social order. It follows the premise that the discourse on social categories and the political attempts to invent, maintain and transform the colonial order has to be combined with what the actors made of it.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the present study is to {{demonstrate}} traces of Homi k. Bhabha’s notion of identity in V. S. Naipaul’s A House for Mr. Biswas (1961). As a prominent postcolonial figure, Bhabha has contemplated over the formation of identity in the colonizing circumstances. He discusses on what happens to the <b>colonizer</b> <b>and</b> the <b>colonized</b> while interacting each other, arguing that both the <b>colonizer</b> <b>and</b> the <b>colonized</b> influence one another during which their identity is formed, fragmented and alienated. In considering Naipaul’s A House for Mr. Biswas as postcolonial text, by the help of postcolonial theories of Homi Bhabha, it is argued that, mentioned novel sums up Naipaul’s approach to how individuals relate to places. This  novel shows  that individuals’ quest for home and a place of belonging is complicated first, by the reality of homelessness, and second, by the socio-cultural complexities peculiar to every place. In other words, the reality of homelessness makes the desire for home, elusive. A House for Mr. Biswas describes the story of homeless and rootless immigrants who lack identity and security in the colonial world. In this novel Naipaul deals with shifting identities, roots, homes and changing realities of migrants.
