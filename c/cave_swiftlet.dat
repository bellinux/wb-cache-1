50|$|The <b>cave</b> <b>swiftlet</b> (Collocalia linchi) is {{a species}} of swift in the family Apodidae. It is found in Indonesia, Malaysia and India. It is a {{woodland}} species and nests in caves. The Bornean swiftlet was considered a subspecies, but is now usually considered distinct.|$|E
50|$|The <b>swiftlets</b> or <b>cave</b> <b>swiftlets</b> have {{developed}} a form of echolocation for navigating through dark cave systems where they roost. One species, the Three-toed swiftlet, has recently been found to use this navigation at night outside its cave roost too.|$|R
50|$|Echolocating animals {{include some}} mammals {{and a few}} birds; most notably microchiropteran bats and odontocetes (toothed whales and dolphins), but also in simpler form in other groups such as shrews, one genus of megachiropteran bats (Rousettus) and two cave {{dwelling}} bird groups, the so-called <b>cave</b> <b>swiftlets</b> in the genus Aerodramus (formerly Collocalia) and the unrelated Oilbird Steatornis caripensis.|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{structure}} of calls emitted by the echolocating fruit bat Rousettus leschenaulti (Megachiroptera: Pteropodidae) while flying inside a free-flight room. The echolocation sounds consists of both single as well as double clicks, with single clicks emitted either in the beginning or {{at the end of}} click sequences. The duration of clicks was brief, about 1. 6 ms and most of the acoustic energy is between 18 to 32 kHz. The use of simple, brief impulsive clicks and the reduction of interpulse interval and duration, when approaching the sides of the walls suggest that they have a good capability of obstacle avoidance as similar to microchiropteran bats. Furthermore, the production of both single as well as double clicks like <b>cave</b> <b>swiftlets</b> in orientation flights has an implication for the evolution of echolocation in bats...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>cave</b> <b>swiftlet</b> has a {{very wide}} range and is common in Java and the nearby islands.

Although the overall population may be declining slightly, this is not believed to be at such a rate as would justify listing it in a more threatened category.|$|E
50|$|Other trogloxenic animals include {{vertebrates}} such as bears, hyenas, other predators, reptiles, oilbirds, <b>cave</b> <b>swiftlets</b> {{and even}} humans, that enter for short term shelter or for hibernation. Most of them contribute organic matter rather than consuming it, and are important resources for troglobitic insects, {{many of which}} actually specialise in reliance on particular species that are long-term regular visitors. The cave environment thus is characterised by absence, restriction, or attenuation of certain factors such as light, circadian or seasonal stimuli, living space, freedom of movement, or abrupt contrasts in temperature and humidity. Other items may depend on local conditions; for example, most caves provide little available food and some provide little water, whereas some provide perennial water or quantities of dung so great as to support ecological stratification, with organisms preying on other organisms that live in turn on different stages of the original product.|$|R

We {{investigated}} the mineralogy, pH, C, N and metal abundance patterns of cave guano spatially and temporally (with depth) along a W–E transect in Malaysia and Palawan from five remote cave sites, each housing large populations of bats and Aerodramus spp. (<b>cave</b> <b>swiftlets).</b> Guano deposits were rich in phosphate and/or sulphate minerals (e. g., gypsum, bassanite) with leucophosphite, spheniscidite, and variscite present in most profiles. Metal abundances measured from modern and ancient bat guano revealed {{high concentrations of}} transition metals relative to the local environment. Highly enriched metals, however, were associated with phosphate rather than sulphate minerals. Copper and Zn were enriched in all profiles, whereas other metals were associated with specific caves consistent with known local mineral resources. For example, Sn, Pb, and Rb were particularly enriched in Batu Cave, located in the Peninsular Malaysian granitic tin belt, whereas Ni and Cr were high in regions associated with ultramafic ophiolites and Ni-laterites found on Palawan...|$|R
50|$|The Bornean swiftlet (Collocalia dodgei), also {{referred}} to as the Kinabalu 'linchi' swiftlet, is a small bird in the swift family Apodidae. It is endemic to the northern mountains of the island of Borneo.

5|$|The Papuan swiftlet, Aerodramus papuensis, {{has three}} toes {{instead of the}} usual four in this group. It has the ability to echolocate, but whereas other {{previously}} studied species use echolocation primarily while flying in their <b>caves,</b> the Papuan <b>swiftlet</b> appears to be nocturnal or crepuscular and uses echolocation while active outside at night. It uses single, not double, clicks. DNA sequence data provides strong support for a basal relationship between A. papuensis and other Aerodramus taxa and suggest that this species and the waterfall swift Hydrochous gigas, are sister taxa, a relationship that would indicate paraphyly of the genus Aerodramus.|$|R
40|$|Microchiropteran bats possess {{sophisticated}} echolocation systems, {{which are}} well matched to their ecological niche (Fenton, 1995). They employ {{a range of}} call types, consisting of frequency modulated and/or constant frequency portions that have durations from as short as 1 ·ms to> 50 ·ms (Neuweiler, 1983). Other echolocating animals including cetaceans (Au, 1993), oilbirds and <b>cave</b> <b>swiftlets</b> (Griffin, 1953; Suthers and Hector, 1985; Fullard et al., 1993) use short duration impulsive clicks as echolocation signals (Fenton, 1984). From a theoretical basis, a signal of infinite amplitude and infinitesimally small duration is ideal for precise location of an echo in time, and thus a short duration, intense click stimulus that approximates this should make a good system for echolocation (Connor, 1982). In the terrestrial environment, however, the difference in impedance between the animal (which acoustically behaves effectively as water) and the transmission medium (air) results in large transmission losses both when the signal is produced and when the echo is received (Cracknell, 1980). Such a system requires the animal to produce a click signal with very high amplitude if the signal is to contain enough energy to produce a detectable echo. In the aquatic environment, by contrast, these clicks are ideally suited to the sound transmission medium {{as there is a}} good match in acoustic impedance between the dolphin and the water. Therefore sonar pulses can be transferred much more efficiently to the water, resulting in high output levels (Norris and Harvey, 1974). Echolocating dolphins show impressive capabilities in target ranging and spatial resolution, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of impulse biosonar if the transmission problems are not an issue (Au, 1993). Given the constraints on impulse biosonar in air, click stimuli used by terrestrial animals for echolocation have been thought of as comparatively simple or rudimentary (Griffin et al., 1958), and little consideration has been given to the fine temporal or spectral structure of their signals. Among the Megachiropteran bats, only the genus Rousettus has developed vocal echolocation, producing signals by clicks of the tongue (Möhres and Kulzer, 1956). The clicks of Rousettus aegyptiacus Geoffroy 1810 are emitted in pairs and have been reported to be in the region of 0. 6 – 1 ·ms duration, with a frequency range of 12 – 70 ·kHz and peak frequency a...|$|R

50|$|Swiftlets are insectivores; hymenopterans and dipterans {{being the}} most {{abundant}} prey. Typically, they leave the cave during the day to forage and return to their roost at night. Males and females look similar; as usual in such cases, these birds are monogamous and both partners take part in caring for the nestlings. Males perform aerial displays to attract females and mating occurs at the nest. The breeding season overlaps the wet season, which corresponds to an increased insect population. Clutch size depends on the location and the food source, but it is generally not large; Aerodramus swiftlets lay 1 to 2 eggs. The eggs are a dull white color and are laid every other day. Many if not all species are colonial nesters; some build their nests in high, dark corners on <b>cave</b> walls. <b>Swiftlets</b> in temperate zones do migrate, but most Aerodramus swiftlets live in the tropical Indo-Pacific region and do not migrate. These birds usually remain in one cave or other roosting/nesting site.

40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to trace the}} historical development of the Chinese taste for bird’s nests {{and its impact on the}} Indonesian economy. The term yanwo or "swiftlet’s nest" appears apparently for the first time in a dietary compendium, the Yinshi xu zhi (Essential Knowledge for Eating and Drinking; 1368), which stresses prevention rather than treatment. It seems that the nests were first collected in South China and eaten locally by commoners before being imported from the South Seas, especially from Champa and Insulinde during the 15 th or early 16 th century. In the 1590 s this taste for bird’s nests was extensively shared by the elite and had spread to Northern provinces. The booming consumption of this delicacy during the following centuries resulted in a huge quest for <b>swiftlet’s</b> <b>caves</b> all over the Archipelago, and in the control of the bird’s nest trade, at first by Indonesian rulers and subsequently by the Dutch authorities. The big novelty in the bird’s nest production was a progressive shift from collecting cave and cliff nests to the practice of swiftlet farming. This swiftlet farming began in the late 1960 s and developed tremendously since the 1980 s in connection with political changes, and with an increasing demand from mainland China. Indonesia is now the biggest supplier of bird’s nests in the world. Salmon Claudine. Le goût chinois pour les nids de salanganes et ses répercussions économiques en Indonésie (XVe/XVIe-XXIe s.).

40|$|From April 1994 to November 2007, {{we studied}} the {{breeding}} biology of the Himalayan swiftlet (Aerodramus brevirostris innominata) based on field investigations, behavior observations, and bird bandings in the Shenjing Cave of Hupingshan National Nature Reserve, Hunan Province. Overall, {{we found a}} total breeding population of 2, 000 <b>swiftlets</b> in the <b>cave.</b> The Himilayan <b>swiftlet</b> is a summer migrant in the area which arrives in early April and departs in early November. This species is monogamous with a sex ratio of about 1 : 1, and reaches sexual maturity at one year of age. Birds nested in dark caves, with nests primarilycomposed of saliva and mosses. Birds took 60 days to finish nest construction, and old nests from previous years were fully reused. We found that egg laying began after nest construction and peaked in June. In most cases, two eggs were found in each nest, while occasionally one egg. Both males and females were involved in incubation, but females invested relatively more time. The incubating temperature, duration, and hatching success were 37. 3 ± 1. 0, 27. 9 ± 3. 4 days, and ℃ 71. 4 %, respectively. Nestlings were altricial, and were fed mainly by males for about 27 days with insects, which {{were the same as}} adults’ diet. They spent another 3 or 4 days to learn to fly in the cave before fledgling the nest. Fledglings gained substantial weight, which tended to be greater total weight than the parents, before leaving the nest. We observed a concordant decrease inweight upon reaching sexual maturity. Primary threats to Himalayan swiftlets in China include disturbance to breeding activities resulting from tourism development and illegal nest-collection. We suggest that authorities halt development of caves and surrounding areas and ban the illegal nests collection...|$|R
40|$|A {{review is}} {{presented}} {{of the history}} of subterranean fauna exploration, the nature of the subterranean environments of Christmas Island and the biogeographical significance of members of the subterranean and springdependent species. The island, which has probably been emergent since the mid-Miocene, has a basalt core largely covered by Tertiary carbonates which have undergone intense karstification owing to the high rainfall on tropical forest, and through mixing corrosion as relative sea level changed and marine terraces formed as a result of tectonic uplift of the island. As a result, surface water is largely absent and drainage is largely as submarine groundwater discharge, however, there is a perched underground stream tapped for water on the plateau and some spring discharge on lower terraces where basalt intercepts the carbonate surface. Together these provide a range of subterranean habitats including terrestrial, freshwater streams and anchialine systems, in addition to springs and spring rills. Terrestrial <b>caves</b> shelter glossy <b>swiftlets</b> that support a rich guano-based community. Sediment banks and the tree root mats spreading over them support a community, thus far not rich, but containing troglobitic species, including the cockroach Metanocticola (Blattodea), scorpion (Ischnuridae), pseudoscorpions (Chthoniidae), microwhipscorpion (Hubbardiidae), spiders (from families Symphytognathidae; Trochanteriidae; Ochyroceratidae; Oonopidae; ?Desidae) and a variety of oniscoid isopods. As expected on an isolated seamount, it supports a procaridiid-type anchialine fauna characterised by an endemic species of Procaris (Procarididae). Unexpectedly, it is the only seamount supporting, in addition, representatives of a remipede-type anchialine fauna, namely Humphreysella (formerly Danielopolina) (Myodocopa: Thaumatocyprididae) and Halosbaena (Thermosbaenacea). In addition, the anchialine system supports the only known extant population of Microceratina (Podocopida: Cytheruridae). The freshwater subterranean stream and spring outlets support an extraordinary diversity of Darwinulidae (Ostracoda). A number of invasive species of fish have been introduced to freshwater areas and if established in springs could have a detrimental impact of stygiofauna and potentially invade anchialine waters. Direct anthropogenic impacts on caves is low owing to minimal caving activity on the island but the most sensitive to trampling are root mats and sediment banks in some caves, and especially guano piles, the disturbance to which could extend to glossy swiftlet colonies. Indirect impacts on fauna may occur owing to changes to the spring discharges as a result of water abstraction which could also impinge on the anchialine system by changing the hydrodynamic relationships between freshwater outflow and seawater, and through contaminants arising from land or sea.
