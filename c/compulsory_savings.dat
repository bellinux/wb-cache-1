5|$|The lack of {{good public}} housing, poor sanitation, and high {{unemployment}} led to social problems from crime to health issues. The proliferation of squatter settlements resulted in safety hazards and caused the Bukit Ho Swee Fire in 1961 that killed four people and left 16,000 others homeless. The Housing Development Board set up before independence {{continued to be}} largely successful and huge building projects sprung up to provide affordable public housing to resettle the squatters. Within a decade, {{the majority of the}} population had been housed in these apartments. The Central Provident Fund (CPF) Housing Scheme, introduced in 1968, allows residents to use their <b>compulsory</b> <b>savings</b> account to purchase HDB flats and gradually increases home ownership in Singapore.|$|E

500|$|During the Second World War, Keynes {{argued in}} How to Pay for the War, {{published}} in 1940, {{that the war}} effort should be largely financed by higher taxation and especially by <b>compulsory</b> <b>saving</b> (essentially workers lending money to the government), rather than deficit spending, {{in order to avoid}} inflation. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>saving</b> would act to dampen domestic demand, assist in channelling additional output towards the war efforts, would be fairer than punitive taxation and would have the advantage of helping to avoid a post war slump by boosting demand once workers were allowed to withdraw their savings. In September 1941 he was proposed to fill a vacancy in the Court of Directors of the Bank of England, and subsequently carried out a full term from the following April. In June 1942, Keynes was rewarded for his service with a hereditary peerage in the King's Birthday Honours.

The definitive publisher-authenticated version Twentieth Century British History (1999) 10 (3) : 255 - 281 is available online at: [URL] article considers the evolution of John Maynard Keynes's wartime plan for <b>compulsory</b> <b>saving</b> in 1939 - 40, {{and the ways in}} which this was influenced by Keynes's desire to solicit the support of the Labour movement for the scheme. It is argued that he saw such support as the prerequisite of the plan's acceptance, and not only actively courted Labour and trade union leaders, but was willing to substantially amend his ideas in a 'socialist' direction in order to make them, as he hoped, 'outrageously attractive' to the Labour Party. Keynes's campaign to woo Labour, and the movement's broadly hostile reaction to the plan, are examined accordingly. It is argued that Labour's rejection of the scheme was largely the result of its genuine preference for physical controls on consumption, as opposed to the strategy of overall demand management favoured by Keynes; although other factors, such as the perceived likely political unpopularity of <b>compulsory</b> <b>saving,</b> played a part. It is finally suggested that, before the accession of the Chuchill coalition, which enabled a partial enactment of the scheme, the political conditions for the plan's acceptance did not exist...|$|R

5000|$|Singapore has a {{universal}} health care system where government ensures affordability, largely through <b>compulsory</b> <b>savings</b> and price controls, while the private sector provides most care. Overall spending on health care amounts to only 3% of annual GDP. Of that, 66% comes from private sources.

Singapore has [...] "one {{of the most successful}} health care systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in community health outcomes," [...] according to an analysis by global consulting firm Watson Wyatt. Singapore's system uses a combination of <b>compulsory</b> <b>savings</b> from payroll deductions (funded by both employers and workers) a nationalized catastrophic health insurance plan, and government subsidies, as well as [...] "actively regulating the supply and prices of health care services in the country" [...] to keep costs in check; the specific features have been described as potentially a [...] "very difficult system to replicate in many other countries."

40|$|Estimating {{saving and}} {{fertility}} simultaneously by the VAR method, {{we find that}} social security cover has {{a positive effect on}} household saving, and a negative effect on fertility. In Germany, as in other countries where the hypothesis was tested, social security is thus good for growth. A possible explanation for this unconventional finding is that <b>compulsory</b> <b>saving</b> in the form of pension contributions tends to displace intra-family transfers, rather than asset formation. However, the negative effect of social security on fertility tends to erode the system’s own contributory base, because it reduces the number of future contributors. That {{is one of the reasons}} why, in Germany as elsewhere, pay-as-you-go pension systems tend to be financially unstable. To some extent, this is counteracted by child-related benefits, which tend to encourage fertility, but the effect appears to be weak. ...|$|R

As Singapore's economy developed, the Central Provident Fund was expanded in 1968 to provide for housing expenses under the Public Housing Scheme. In 1984 the Central Provident Fund was again expanded to cover medical and care expenses. As the Central Provident Fund developed, dedicated accounts were created for the different expenses the Fund was designed to cover, to ensure a more targeted savings approach. In 1986 a higher risk investment option was added to give members the opportunity of a higher rate of return on their savings.|$|E

Disparity existed between private and public sector pension plans as public sector pension benefit levels were generally better and more widely covered, and to address the lack of coverage for certain private sector employees the KN, National Pension law, was passed in 1961 which set up a <b>compulsory</b> <b>savings</b> system requiring everyone from self-employers to the jobless to pay a flat-contribution rate {{on an individual basis}} for a flat-rate benefits package.

His acquittal by Ujung Pandang District Court in 1999 sparked protests and claims that Attorney General Andi Ghalib, a former deputy governor of South Sulawesi, had intervened on Nurdin's behalf. Nurdin had previously funded Ghalib's failed bid to become South Sulawesi governor. Gagoek Soebagyanto, the prosecutor who initiated charges against Nurdin and wanted to have him detained pending trial, was dismissed by Ghalib, while another prosecutor involved in the case was transferred to Irian Jaya (now Papua) province. In March 1999, the new prosecutors handling the case told the court that Nurdin should be freed. They claimed there was a legal basis for the criminal act of misusing SWKP funds as collateral for bank credit without the permission of the owners. Judges were criticized for refusing to allow testimony from a key witness, a bank official. In addition to acquitting Nurdin, the panel of judges also ordered the release of confiscated evidence, including his luxury home and a deposit of Rp 8 billion in the name of Puskud Hasanuddin. Judges said that although the four indictments concerned irregularities in clove purchases, irregularities in the release of clove farmers' funds, irregularities in working capital and irregularities in funding, all payments had been settled. University students, professors and lecturers protested what they described as [...] "the death of justice". Police responded to one protest by firing live ammunition.|$|E
