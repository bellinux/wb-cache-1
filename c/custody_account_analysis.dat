40|$|The {{assessment}} of the Slovenian central bank, the Bank of Slovenia (BS), adjustment policy to surges in capital flows has shown that BS was quite successful in its attempts to mitigate detrimental effects of capital flows on national economy. As such an increased flows through capital account did not cause the excessive money supply. The latter meets money demand and current account most of the time. On the other side, analysis indicates that the BS was not so successful in preventing real appreciation of exchange rate, deriving from excessive foreign currency inflow, which had a rather strong significance {{as one of the}} foreign exchange determinants with negative influence on its growth (depreciation). In addition to indirect adjustment methods the so-called direct methods of adjustment to surges in capital flows were also used.

50|$|An LGD model {{assesses the}} value and/or {{the quality of}} a {{security}} the bank holds for providing the loan - securities can be either machinery like cars, trucks or construction machines. It can be mortgages or it can be a <b>custody</b> <b>account</b> or a commodity. The higher the value of the security the lower the LGD and thus the potential loss the bank or insurance faces {{in the case of a}} default. Banks using the A-IRB approach have to determine LGD values, whereas banks within the F-IRB do only have to do so for the retail-portfolio. For example, as of 2013, there were nine companies in the United Kingdom with their own mortgage LGD models. In Switzerland there were two banks as of 2013. In Germany many thrifts - especially the market leader Bausparkasse Schwäbisch Hall - have their own mortgage LGD models. In the corporate asset class many German banks still only use the values given by the regulator under the F-IRB approach.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe present paper {{performs}} a development <b>accounting</b> <b>analysis</b> {{to investigate the}} sources of China's interprovincial income inequality over the period 1982 – 2005. We estimate a Cobb–Douglas aggregate production function with various specifications. Using the estimated parameters, we conduct a development <b>accounting</b> <b>analysis</b> {{as well as a}} variance decomposition. Our results suggest that differences in physical capital intensity and in total factor productivity are both important sources of cross-province income differences, each accounting for roughly half of the variation in income levels. Differences in human capital explain only a small amount of income differences across provinces. The results are robust {{to whether or not the}} assumption of constant returns to scale is imposed. The interaction between factor accumulation and total factor productivity is also discussed...|$|R
