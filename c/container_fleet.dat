25|$|The {{two main}} current {{competitors}} of the Panama Canal are the US intermodal {{system and the}} Suez Canal. The main ports and merchandise distribution centers in these routes are investing in capacity, location, and maritime and land infrastructure to serve post-Panamax container ships and their larger cargo volumes.

It was estimated that by 2011 approximately 37% of {{the capacity of the}} world's <b>container</b> ship <b>fleet</b> would consist of vessels that did not fit through the current canal, and a great part of this fleet could be used on routes that compete with Panama.|$|R

40|$|<b>Container</b> liner <b>fleet</b> {{deployment}} (CLFD) is {{the assignment}} of containerships to port rotations (ship routes) for efficient transport of containers. As liner shipping services have fixed schedules, the ship-related operating cost is determined at the CLFD stage. This paper provides a critical review of existing mathematical models developed for the CLFD problems. It first gives a systematic overview of the fundamental assumptions used by the existing CLFD models. The operating characteristics dealt with in existing studies are then examined, including container transshipment and routing, uncertain demand, empty container repositioning, ship sailing speed optimization and ship repositioning. Finally, this paper points out four important future research opportunities: fleet deployment considering ship surveys and inspections, service dependent demand, pollutant emissions, and CLFD for shipping alliances.

30|$|The multidimensional {{examination}} implies {{defining and}} developing the analytical models of {{indicators of the}} trunk line’s infrastructural, technical/technological, operational, economic, environmental, and social performances and their application to the selected real-life case. The infrastructural performances relate to the characteristics of infrastructure (berths) and container terminals in the seaports {{at both ends of}} the line. The technical/technological performances reflect the characteristics of facilities and equipment for loading/unloading and storing TEU shipments in these terminals, and that of the container ships transporting them. The operational performances include the transport service frequency, size, transport work and technical productivity of the deployed <b>container</b> ship <b>fleet</b> while serving a given volume of TEU flows during the specified time. The economic performances contain the inventory, handling, transport, and external costs of handling the TEU flows. The environmental performances relate to the fuel consumption and consequent emissions of GHG (Green House Gases). Finally, the social performances in terms of impacts generally refer to noise, congestion, and safety.|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to apply}} System Dynamics (SD) {{to analyze the}} optimal timing of {{container}} ship orders by considering the uncertain shipping environment. The collected monthly data for 12 years {{was obtained from the}} China seaborne container trade (CSCT) and the China Containerized Freight Index (CCFI). Containership fleet development and the prices of new and second-hand container ships were classified based on five container vessel sizes (January of 2004 –December of 2015). The period of simulation for this study was from 2004 to 2020. To analyze the optimal timing for the container ship orders, <b>container</b> ship <b>fleet</b> development as a supply factor and the CSCT as a demand factor, both of which are components of CCFI, were simulated. After the first simulation, CCFI was simulated holistically. Based on the CCFI simulation results, it was possible to develop three optimal timing scenarios for ship order placement. The CCFI for October 2016 was in the initial entry status of a short-term rebound, which makes it possible for shipping companies to order ships without the risk of revenue loss. The second best time period is May 2018, before the CCFI recovery of May 2019. The third best time for ship orders is later in 2020 for a CCFI recovery after 2021...|$|R
