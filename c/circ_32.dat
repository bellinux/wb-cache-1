40|$|AbstractReachability and {{observability}} of two-dimensional (2 D) discrete state-space {{models are}} introduced {{in two different}} forms: a local form, which refers to single local states, and a global form, which pertains to the infinite set of local states lying on a separation set [M. Bisiacco, State and output feedback stabilizability of 2 D systems, IEEE Trans. <b>Circ.</b> Syst., CAS- <b>32</b> (1985) 1246 – 1249; E. Fornasini, G. Marchesini, Global properties and duality in 2 -D systems, Syst. Control Lett. 2 (1) (1982) 30 – 38]. While local reachability and observability can be naturally characterized by resorting to classical state space techniques, their global counterparts are better addressed by means of polynomial techniques. In this paper, reachability and observability are introduced {{in the context of}} 2 D positive systems and their global versions investigated via a polynomial approach. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of these properties are provided and, in particular, polynomial canonical forms for globally reachable/observable positive systems with scalar inputs/scalar outputs are provided...|$|R

Circulation 94 : 833 - 841, 1996) for {{study of a}} mathematical model cell with spontaneous activity, viz. a "real-time" simulation of a rabbit sinoatrial node cell (SAN model cell; R. Wilders, H. J. Jongsma, and A. C. van Ginneken. Biophys. J. 60 : 1202 - 1216, 1991) simultaneously being electrically coupled via our "coupling clamp" [H. Sugiura and R. W. Joyner. Am. J. Physiol. 263 (Heart <b>Circ.</b> Physiol. <b>32)</b> : H 1591 -H 1604, 1992] circuit to a real, isolated ventricular myocyte. We now apply this technique to investigate effects of coupling conductance (Gc), cell size, and the modulation of membrane potential by elevated extracellular potassium concentration {{on the ability of}} an ectopic focus, represented by the SAN model cell, to successfully drive a ventricular cell. Values of Gc and the relative sizes of the two cells define three possible outcomes: 1) spontaneous pacing of the SAN model cell but not driving of the ventricular cell, 2) cessation of spontaneous pacing, or 3) pacing of the SAN model cell and driving of the ventricular cell. Below a critical size of the SAN model cell only the first two of these outcomes is possible. Above this critical size there is a range of Gc that allows successful operation of the system as an ectopic focus. Elevation of extracellular potassium concentration from 4 to 8 mM increases both the lower bound and upper bound of Gc for this range. Elevation of extracellular potassium concentration, as commonly observed in myocardial ischemia, may have effects on either inhibiting or releasing from inhibition an ectopic focu...|$|R
