5000|$|In {{a survey}} {{initiated}} by UEFA in 2007, {{a majority of}} the <b>consulted</b> <b>national</b> associations wanted to improve relations between clubs and fans, to enable fans to become [...] "more serious and responsible partners". To achieve this, UEFA started backing several European supporter organisations, such as Supporters Direct Europe (SD Europe) and Football Supporters Europe (FSE). UEFA also acknowleged that football supporters had been largely ignored in the dialogue surrounding football, but should be considered valued members of the football family. One outcome of this commitment was the creation of the UEFA Supporter Liaison Officer Handbook published in 2011.|$|E
40|$|How {{much does}} {{the private sector}} really borrow? A new {{database}} for total credit to the private nonfinancial sector 1 Despite their importance, data capturing total credit to the private non-financial sector are scarce. This article introduces a new BIS database that provides this information for 40 economies with, on average, more than 45 years of quarterly data, reaching back to the 1940 s and 1950 s in some cases. It explains the key concepts underlying the compilation of the new series, including {{a description of the}} high-level statistical criteria applied, the characteristics of the underlying series used and the statistical techniques employed. For illustration purposes, some facets of the historical evolution of total credit are explored, revealing interesting similarities and differences across countries. JEL classification: C 82, E 51. Credit is vital for economic activity. Households borrow to smooth consumption and purchase homes. Firms often require credit to finance investments. Unsurprisingly, private sector borrowing has important implications for policy. It influences the monetary transmission mechanism and is a major determinant of financial stability – history shows that systemic banking crises tend to be preceded by unusually large build-ups of credit in the private sector. Despite this importance, series for total credit to the non-financial private sector have not been readily available. Even in countries that compile financial accounts, the series for total credit tend to be quite short. As a result, practitioners and researchers have often resorted to well established statistics on bank credit that fail to include credit from non-banks or foreign lenders. To remedy this, BIS statisticians have compiled long-run series of total credit for 40 advanced and emerging market economies. In doing so, they <b>consulted</b> <b>national</b> 1 The construction of the long-run credit series would have been impossible without the extensiv...|$|E

Using a {{checklist}} to evaluate hospitalized patients who suffer a fall. POGOe - Portal of Geriatric Online Education; 2011 Available from: [URL] Falls suffered by hospitalized patients {{are an important}} reportable event. Approximately 4 - 6 % of inpatient falls result in serious injury. Recurrent falls or delayed recognition of injury can harm patients and represents a medico-legal risk. In 2010, our tertiary-care academic medical center reviewed current practice regarding falls prevention and assessment to develop a comprehensive falls prevention program. The committee {{found that there was}} no consistent practice in the assessment by nurses or physicians of inpatients who had fallen, either for injury or for conditions which might have led to the fall. A new systematic checklist for evaluation of the hospital faller was developed by a team consisting of nursing, hospitalists, and a medical unit director. Purpose: To develop an evidence-based multi-disciplinary checklist to facilitate evaluation, implementation of secondary prevention interventions and documentation following a hospital fall. Description: The hospitalist and the general medical unit director reviewed relevant literature, <b>consulted</b> <b>national</b> experts, and drafted a multidisciplinary checklist, the UNMH Post-Fall/Huddle Tool, to be used by nurses and physicians in post-fall patient evaluation. The checklist was reviewed and revised with further input from key stakeholders including hospitalists, housestaff, and the adult Medical/Surgical Shared Governance Committee. It was implemented as part of a comprehensive falls prevention program 3 month pilot. The checklist prompts a three step process: (1) an initial 7 -item assessment by nursing staff to determine factors which would necessitate immediate evaluation by cross-covering physicians versus deferring evaluation to the primary team; (2) a 5 -item focused physical examination to be performed by a physician to assess the likelihood of injury and suggested diagnostic tests based on this examination; and (3) an interdisciplinary face-to-face meeting between the evaluating physician and nurse to review 7 specific possible precipitating events and implement potential interventions. The UNMH Post-Fall/Huddle Tool will be adapted into the electronic health record after pilot completion and evaluation. An educational presentation about falls and how to use the checklist was developed for residents and hospitalists. Use of the checklist was implemented in November, 2010. To date, nurses and residents report that the checklist is easy to use and that it facilitates a timely, multidisciplinary evaluation of patients who have fallen in the hospital. Conclusion: A multi-disciplinary post-fall checklist facilitates a consistent and evidence-based evaluation and treatment of patients who have fallen in the hospital...|$|E

The survey addressed: coverage, funding, procurement of basic supplies, managerial capacity, and the local political environment. Findings were triangulated with in-depth interviews with key informants. The main findings included: satisfactory adherence to the initiatives and adequate documentation, but deficiencies in terms of coverage and monitoring, and uneven procurement of resources. Program personnel work mostly on a provisional basis, {{despite the efforts of}} local coordinators. Most programs are funded by the National STDs/AIDS Program.
