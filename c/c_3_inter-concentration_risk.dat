To determine whether stabilization of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> bBb occurs by the binding of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> NeF to <b>C</b> <b>3</b> bBb itself, to <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b or Bb alone, homologous and heterologous cell-bound convertases were prepared with <b>C</b> <b>3</b> hu, Bhu, <b>C</b> <b>3</b> rat and Brat and exposed to <b>C</b> <b>3</b> NeF or properdin.

To determine whether binding of [125 I]-C 3 NeF to the various convertases occurred, cell-bound convertase were prepared in the presence of excess Bhu and Brat, washed and further incubated with [125 I]-C 3 NeF; the cells were then washed and the amount of cell-bound [125 I]-C 3 NeF was measured. As in the stabilization experiments <b>C</b> <b>3</b> NeF bound only to <b>C</b> <b>3</b> huBbhu and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> bratBbhu.

To clarify this mechanism, the self-association properties and solution structures of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> u were determined using analytical ultracentrifugation and X-ray scattering.

It is here reported that, both on cells and in the fluid phase, the breakdown of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> bi in serum gives rise to two products: <b>C</b> <b>3</b> <b>c</b> and the product previously described as alpha 2 D, which we now propose to designate <b>C</b> <b>3</b> d,g. Alpha 2 D differs from <b>C</b> <b>3</b> d in that it contains an additional fragment of approximately 8, 000 mol wt that carries the antigenic determinant for the clone 9 monoclonal anti-C <b>3</b> antibody. <b>C</b> <b>3</b> g cannot be precipitated by anti-C 3 antisera and therefore behaves as a uni- or bideterminant antigen.

With hydrolysis of one polypeptide bonds, <b>C</b> <b>3</b> a, the 9000 dalton activation peptide is dislocated from the NH 2 -terminal portion of the alpha-chain. A previously concealed binding region is thereby transiently revealed in the <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b-fragment (181, 000 dalton) which displays affinity for apparently nonspecific acceptors present on biological membranes. Binding of nascent <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b membranes occurs through the <b>C</b> <b>3</b> d portion of the fragment because subsequent action of the <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b-inactivator or trypsin on bound <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b causes release of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> <b>c,</b> but not of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> d.

40|$|Complement <b>C</b> <b>3</b> is {{the central}} {{component}} of the human complement system. It is ~ 186 kDa in size, consisting of an α-chain (~ 110 kDa) and a β-chain (~ 75 kDa) that are connected by cysteine bridges. <b>C</b> <b>3</b> in its native form is inactive. Cleavage of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> into <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b (~ 177 kDa) and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> a (~ 9 kDa) is a crucial step in the complement activation cascade, which can be initiated {{by one or more}} of the three distinct pathways, called alternative, classical and lectin complement pathways. In the alternative pathway, hydrated <b>C</b> <b>3</b> (<b>C</b> <b>3</b> (H 20)) recruits complement factor B (fB), which is then cleaved by complement factor D (fD) to result in formation of the minor form of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> -convertase (<b>C</b> <b>3</b> (H 20) Bb) that cleaves <b>C</b> <b>3</b> into <b>C</b> <b>3</b> a and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b. A small percent of the resulting <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b is rapidly deposited (opsonization through covalent bond) in the immediate vicinity of the site of activation (e. g. pathogen surface) and now forms the major form of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> -convertase (<b>C</b> <b>3</b> bBb), thereby creating an efficient cycle of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> cleavage. Properdin, a positive regulator of the alternative pathway convertases, provides a hub for the assembly of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> bBb in addition to stabilization of the convertase. Classical and lectin pathways, when activated with recognition of pathogens or immune complexes use another <b>C</b> <b>3</b> -convertase (<b>C</b> 4 b 2 a) to cleave <b>C</b> <b>3</b> into <b>C</b> <b>3</b> a and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b. Although the three pathways are activated independently, they converge at <b>C</b> <b>3</b> and use <b>C</b> <b>3</b> as a substrate for their pathway specific <b>C</b> <b>3</b> -convertase: <b>C</b> <b>3</b> (H 20) Bb, <b>C</b> <b>3</b> bBb or <b>C</b> 4 b 2 a. Further, <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b undergoes successive proteolytic cleavages by the regulatory complement factor I (fI) in presence of cofactors and lead to generation of iC 3 b (~ 174 kDa), <b>C</b> <b>3</b> d/C 3 dg (~ 33 kDa), <b>C</b> <b>3</b> <b>c</b> (~ 142 kDa) and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> f (~ 2 kDa). <b>C</b> <b>3</b> a is an anaphylatoxin while <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b is involved in opsonization of pathogens or apoptotic cells. Covalently bound <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b on pathogen/apoptotic cell surface is recognized by host immune cells through phagocytic (or complement component) receptors and induce subsequent immune response or directly target pathogen for clearance. The <b>C</b> <b>3</b> a fragment functions as a chemokine, and thereby recruits phagocytic and granulocytic cells to the sites of inflammation and cause strong pro-inflammatory signaling through their G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). As pathogen or apoptotic cell surface bound <b>C</b> <b>3</b> -convertases (<b>C</b> <b>3</b> bBb or <b>C</b> 4 b 2 a) can induce the amplification of the alternative pathway, this pathway might contribute to the major part of the complement activation process, even when initially triggered by the classical pathway and/or lectin pathway. Continuous activation of complement pathways shifts the substrate preference from <b>C</b> <b>3</b> to <b>C</b> 5 by formation of C 5 -convertase (formed by addition of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b fragment to <b>C</b> <b>3</b> -convertases, <b>C</b> <b>3</b> (H 20) Bb <b>3</b> b, <b>C</b> <b>3</b> bBb <b>3</b> b and <b>C</b> 4 b 2 a <b>3</b> b). <b>C</b> 5 -convertase activates C 5, which by series of additional steps, promotes killing of target cell (pathogen) by pore formation...|$|R

The binding of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b was demonstrated indirectly by a fluoresceinated anti-C 3 serum and directly by using radioiodinated proteins. No other complement proteins or serum factors were needed to mediate binding of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b to the receptor. The possibility of enzymatic cleavage of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> before or after its attachment on the cell membrane was ruled out by the demonstration of antigenically intact <b>C</b> <b>3</b> on Raji cells. Inhibition and dissociation of Raji cell-EAC 1423 rosettes by <b>C</b> <b>3</b> and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b indicated that both of these proteins bind to the same receptor site or closely associated receptor sites on Raji cells. <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b-bearing Raji cells were immune adherence negative, indicating that <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b binding to the receptor is brought about through the immune adherence region of the molecule and not the <b>C</b> <b>3</b> d portion.

Those products which remain in the fluid phase, the subject of the present paper, have been identified by their reaction with monospecific antisera to the three antigenic determinants of <b>C</b> <b>3,</b> A, B, and D, after electrophoresis in agar or polyacrylamide gel. When purified <b>C</b> <b>3</b> reacts with EAC 1, 4, 2, <b>C</b> <b>3</b> i is found in the fluid phase. <b>C</b> <b>3</b> i, a loose complex of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> a and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b, is in a conformational state whereby only the A and D antigens, present on its <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b portion, will consume antibody.

40|$|The properdin-binding site in {{the human}} third {{complement}} component (<b>C</b> <b>3)</b> was mapped by using isolated <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b, <b>C</b> <b>3</b> <b>c,</b> alpha- and beta-chains of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> polypeptide fragments and an enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay procedure. The <b>C</b> <b>3</b> chains and the polypeptide fragments were purified to homogeneity by preparative sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The alpha-chain polypeptides included a 68 kDa and a 43 kDa polypeptide, which were generated by cleavage of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b with factors I and H, and a 40 kDa, 33 kDa (<b>C</b> <b>3</b> d) and 27 kDa polypeptide, which were generated by cleavage of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b with porcine elastase.

When bone marrow-derived lymphocytes (B cells) were demonstrated to have <b>C</b> <b>3</b> receptors, these were at first thought to be also specific for the <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b fragment of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> (5).

40|$|Most dicot-infecting geminiviruses encode a {{replication}} enhancer protein (<b>C</b> <b>3,</b> AL 3, or REn) that {{is required}} for optimal replication of their small, single-stranded DNA genomes. <b>C</b> <b>3</b> interacts with <b>C</b> 1, the essential viral replication protein that initiates rolling circle replication. <b>C</b> <b>3</b> also homo-oligomerizes and interacts {{with at least two}} host-encoded proteins, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the retinoblastoma-related protein (pRBR). It has been proposed that protein interactions contribute to <b>C</b> <b>3</b> function. Using the <b>C</b> <b>3</b> protein of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus, we examined the impact of mutations to amino acids that are conserved across the <b>C</b> <b>3</b> protein family on replication enhancement and protein interactions. Surprisingly, many of the muta-tions did not affect replication enhancement activity of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> in tobacco protoplasts. Other mutations either enhanced or were detrimental to <b>C</b> <b>3</b> replication activity. Analysis of mutated proteins in yeast two-hybrid assays indicated that mutations that inactivate <b>C</b> <b>3</b> replication enhancement activity also reduce or inactivate <b>C</b> <b>3</b> oligomerization and interaction with C 1 and PCNA.
