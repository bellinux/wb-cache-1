To determine whether stabilization of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> bBb occurs by the binding of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> NeF to <b>C</b> <b>3</b> bBb itself, to <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b or Bb alone, homologous and heterologous cell-bound convertases were prepared with <b>C</b> <b>3</b> hu, Bhu, <b>C</b> <b>3</b> rat and Brat and exposed to <b>C</b> <b>3</b> NeF or properdin.

To determine whether binding of [125 I]-C 3 NeF to the various convertases occurred, cell-bound convertase were prepared in the presence of excess Bhu and Brat, washed and further incubated with [125 I]-C 3 NeF; the cells were then washed and the amount of cell-bound [125 I]-C 3 NeF was measured. As in the stabilization experiments <b>C</b> <b>3</b> NeF bound only to <b>C</b> <b>3</b> huBbhu and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> bratBbhu.

To clarify this mechanism, the self-association properties and solution structures of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> u were determined using analytical ultracentrifugation and X-ray scattering.

It is here reported that, both on cells and in the fluid phase, the breakdown of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> bi in serum gives rise to two products: <b>C</b> <b>3</b> <b>c</b> and the product previously described as alpha 2 D, which we now propose to designate <b>C</b> <b>3</b> d,g. Alpha 2 D differs from <b>C</b> <b>3</b> d in that it contains an additional fragment of approximately 8, 000 mol wt that carries the antigenic determinant for the clone 9 monoclonal anti-C <b>3</b> antibody. <b>C</b> <b>3</b> g cannot be precipitated by anti-C 3 antisera and therefore behaves as a uni- or bideterminant antigen.

With hydrolysis of one polypeptide bonds, <b>C</b> <b>3</b> a, the 9000 dalton activation peptide is dislocated from the NH 2 -terminal portion of the alpha-chain. A previously concealed binding region is thereby transiently revealed in the <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b-fragment (181, 000 dalton) which displays affinity for apparently nonspecific acceptors present on biological membranes. Binding of nascent <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b membranes occurs through the <b>C</b> <b>3</b> d portion of the fragment because subsequent action of the <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b-inactivator or trypsin on bound <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b causes release of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> <b>c,</b> but not of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> d.

40|$|Complement <b>C</b> <b>3</b> is {{the central}} {{component}} of the human complement system. It is ~ 186 kDa in size, consisting of an Î±-chain (~ 110 kDa) and a Î²-chain (~ 75 kDa) that are connected by cysteine bridges. <b>C</b> <b>3</b> in its native form is inactive. Cleavage of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> into <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b (~ 177 kDa) and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> a (~ 9 kDa) is a crucial step in the complement activation cascade, which can be initiated {{by one or more}} of the three distinct pathways, called alternative, classical and lectin complement pathways. In the alternative pathway, hydrated <b>C</b> <b>3</b> (<b>C</b> <b>3</b> (H 20)) recruits complement factor B (fB), which is then cleaved by complement factor D (fD) to result in formation of the minor form of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> -convertase (<b>C</b> <b>3</b> (H 20) Bb) that cleaves <b>C</b> <b>3</b> into <b>C</b> <b>3</b> a and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b. A small percent of the resulting <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b is rapidly deposited (opsonization through covalent bond) in the immediate vicinity of the site of activation (e. g. pathogen surface) and now forms the major form of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> -convertase (<b>C</b> <b>3</b> bBb), thereby creating an efficient cycle of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> cleavage. Properdin, a positive regulator of the alternative pathway convertases, provides a hub for the assembly of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> bBb in addition to stabilization of the convertase. Classical and lectin pathways, when activated with recognition of pathogens or immune complexes use another <b>C</b> <b>3</b> -convertase (<b>C</b> 4 b 2 a) to cleave <b>C</b> <b>3</b> into <b>C</b> <b>3</b> a and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b. Although the three pathways are activated independently, they converge at <b>C</b> <b>3</b> and use <b>C</b> <b>3</b> as a substrate for their pathway specific <b>C</b> <b>3</b> -convertase: <b>C</b> <b>3</b> (H 20) Bb, <b>C</b> <b>3</b> bBb or <b>C</b> 4 b 2 a. Further, <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b undergoes successive proteolytic cleavages by the regulatory complement factor I (fI) in presence of cofactors and lead to generation of iC 3 b (~ 174 kDa), <b>C</b> <b>3</b> d/C 3 dg (~ 33 kDa), <b>C</b> <b>3</b> <b>c</b> (~ 142 kDa) and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> f (~ 2 kDa). <b>C</b> <b>3</b> a is an anaphylatoxin while <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b is involved in opsonization of pathogens or apoptotic cells. Covalently bound <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b on pathogen/apoptotic cell surface is recognized by host immune cells through phagocytic (or complement component) receptors and induce subsequent immune response or directly target pathogen for clearance. The <b>C</b> <b>3</b> a fragment functions as a chemokine, and thereby recruits phagocytic and granulocytic cells to the sites of inflammation and cause strong pro-inflammatory signaling through their G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). As pathogen or apoptotic cell surface bound <b>C</b> <b>3</b> -convertases (<b>C</b> <b>3</b> bBb or <b>C</b> 4 b 2 a) can induce the amplification of the alternative pathway, this pathway might contribute to the major part of the complement activation process, even when initially triggered by the classical pathway and/or lectin pathway. Continuous activation of complement pathways shifts the substrate preference from <b>C</b> <b>3</b> to <b>C</b> 5 by formation of C 5 -convertase (formed by addition of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b fragment to <b>C</b> <b>3</b> -convertases, <b>C</b> <b>3</b> (H 20) Bb <b>3</b> b, <b>C</b> <b>3</b> bBb <b>3</b> b and <b>C</b> 4 b 2 a <b>3</b> b). <b>C</b> 5 -convertase activates C 5, which by series of additional steps, promotes killing of target cell (pathogen) by pore formation...|$|R

The binding of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b was demonstrated indirectly by a fluoresceinated anti-C 3 serum and directly by using radioiodinated proteins. No other complement proteins or serum factors were needed to mediate binding of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b to the receptor. The possibility of enzymatic cleavage of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> before or after its attachment on the cell membrane was ruled out by the demonstration of antigenically intact <b>C</b> <b>3</b> on Raji cells. Inhibition and dissociation of Raji cell-EAC 1423 rosettes by <b>C</b> <b>3</b> and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b indicated that both of these proteins bind to the same receptor site or closely associated receptor sites on Raji cells. <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b-bearing Raji cells were immune adherence negative, indicating that <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b binding to the receptor is brought about through the immune adherence region of the molecule and not the <b>C</b> <b>3</b> d portion. The <b>C</b> <b>3</b> receptor on Raji cell membranes is uniformly distributed and can move on the membrane plane.

Those products which remain in the fluid phase, the subject of the present paper, have been identified by their reaction with monospecific antisera to the three antigenic determinants of <b>C</b> <b>3,</b> A, B, and D, after electrophoresis in agar or polyacrylamide gel.

40|$|The properdin-binding site in {{the human}} third {{complement}} component (<b>C</b> <b>3)</b> was mapped by using isolated <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b, <b>C</b> <b>3</b> <b>c,</b> alpha- and beta-chains of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> and <b>C</b> <b>3</b> polypeptide fragments and an enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay procedure. The <b>C</b> <b>3</b> chains and the polypeptide fragments were purified to homogeneity by preparative sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The alpha-chain polypeptides included a 68 kDa and a 43 kDa polypeptide, which were generated by cleavage of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b with factors I and H, and a 40 kDa, 33 kDa (<b>C</b> <b>3</b> d) and 27 kDa polypeptide, which were generated by cleavage of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b with porcine elastase.

When bone marrow-derived lymphocytes (B cells) were demonstrated to have <b>C</b> <b>3</b> receptors, these were at first thought to be also specific for the <b>C</b> <b>3</b> b fragment of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> (5).

40|$|Most dicot-infecting geminiviruses encode a {{replication}} enhancer protein (<b>C</b> <b>3,</b> AL 3, or REn) that {{is required}} for optimal replication of their small, single-stranded DNA genomes. <b>C</b> <b>3</b> interacts with <b>C</b> 1, the essential viral replication protein that initiates rolling circle replication. <b>C</b> <b>3</b> also homo-oligomerizes and interacts {{with at least two}} host-encoded proteins, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the retinoblastoma-related protein (pRBR). It has been proposed that protein interactions contribute to <b>C</b> <b>3</b> function. Using the <b>C</b> <b>3</b> protein of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus, we examined the impact of mutations to amino acids that are conserved across the <b>C</b> <b>3</b> protein family on replication enhancement and protein interactions. Surprisingly, many of the muta-tions did not affect replication enhancement activity of <b>C</b> <b>3</b> in tobacco protoplasts. Other mutations either enhanced or were detrimental to <b>C</b> <b>3</b> replication activity. Analysis of mutated proteins in yeast two-hybrid assays indicated that mutations that inactivate <b>C</b> <b>3</b> replication enhancement activity also reduce or inactivate <b>C</b> <b>3</b> oligomerization and interaction with C 1 and PCNA.
