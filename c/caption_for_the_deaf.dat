25|$|A 1962 {{appearance}} {{on a book}} review show on {{what was then the}} National Educational Television (NET) station of Boston, WGBH-TV (now a major Public Broadcasting Service station), led to the inception of her first television cooking show after viewers enjoyed her demonstration of how to cook an omelette.

The show ran nationally for ten years and won Peabody and Emmy Awards, including the first Emmy award for an educational program. Though she was not the first television cook, Child was the most widely seen.

40|$|Producing {{off-line}} <b>captions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaf</b> {{and hearing}} impaired {{people is a}} labor-intensive task that can require up to 18 hours of production per hour of film. Captions are placed manually close to the region of interest but it must avoid masking human faces, texts or any moving objects that might be relevant to the story flow. Our goal is to use image processing techniques to reduce the off-line caption production process by automatically placing the captions on the proper consecutive frames. We implemented a computer-assisted captioning software tool which integrates detection of faces, texts and visual motion regions. The near frontal faces are detected using a cascade of weak classifier and tracked through a particle filter. Then, frames are scanned to perform text spotting and build a region map suitable for text recognition. Finally, motion mapping {{is based on the}} Lukas-Kanade optical flow algorithm and provides MPEG- 7 motion descriptors. The combined detected items are then fed to a rule-based algorithm to determine <b>the</b> best <b>captions</b> localization <b>for</b> <b>the</b> related sequences of frames.

40|$|The {{history of}} {{educational}} technology predates {{the invention of}} the term by a considerable period of time. From a historical perspective, technology applied to education must be seen in reference to the available technology of the society and the times of which we speak. When Moses brought the Ten Commandments from the mountain engraved in stone, there is no question but that it carried a greater impact than if it had been hand-lettered on Papyrus or whatever alternatives existed. One might say that engraving the Ten Commandments in stone added an appropriate kinesthetic dimension to such a weighty message, and it didn‟t discriminate against <b>the</b> <b>deaf</b> and blind. However, you can be sure that, had the technology been available, Moses would have recorded the voice of God on Memorex audiotape and played it back full volume on a stereo system with appropriate psychedelic lighting. To pursue ancient history a bit longer, we hardly need to point out the massive effect of printing technology in the dissemination of knowledge and God‟s Commandments. Printing, we might say, has been and still is the backbone technology of the world‟s various educational systems. The dawn of educational technology <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hearing impaired is generally regarded to be the year of 1958 when P. L. 85 - 905 established <b>Captioned</b> Films <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deaf.</b> In terms of modern communication technology, particularly electronics, this is as good a starting point as any, although there are educator...|$|R
40|$|People who are deaf or hard {{of hearing}} need {{captions}} to understand spoken words in movies and television shows. By the 1990 s, after decades of struggles, advocates <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaf</b> community were largely successful in utilizing legislative, regulatory, and litigation remedies to get producers to caption their movies and television shows. However, {{some time in the}} late 1990 s and early 2000 s, many producers inexplicably stopped captioning song lyrics in their movies and television shows. This decision seems to be a reaction to court cases holding that producers needed separate copyrights to produce song lyrics on “sing-along” videocassettes and karaoke machines. Producers apparently believed that separate copyrights are necessary to <b>caption</b> song lyrics <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>deaf</b> and {{hard of hearing}} consumers. This article contends that the producers are mistaken in using a “copyright defense” as an excuse not to caption song lyrics, and are potentially leaving themselves vulnerable to a class action lawsuit by deaf consumers if they continue the practice. Recent court decisions have respectively established that 1) providing full accessibility and enjoyment for deaf customers means captioning song lyrics and 2) copying otherwise protected material <b>for</b> <b>the</b> purpose of making it accessible to customers with disabilities comes within the “fair use” exception of the Copyright Act. If history is any guide, {{it is only a matter}} of time before <b>the</b> <b>deaf</b> community turns to the courts to force producers to caption the lyrics to songs that are featured in their movies and television shows. While producers could very well have valid defenses against a lawsuit <b>for</b> not <b>captioning</b> song lyrics in movies or shows, the “copyright defense” should not be one of them. ...|$|R
40|$|Across the world, several {{museums are}} {{committed}} to accessibility and accommodations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> general public, such as closed <b>captions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> D/HH (<b>deaf</b> and hard-of-hearing) visitors and ramps for wheelchair users. However, not all disabilities and disorders are visible. When it comes to working {{with people who have}} a specific disability or disorder, it is critical that museum professionals be aware of what should be done to ensure that visitors with disabilities or disorders have a pleasant experience in the museum. Numerous museums have already created programs for people with specific disabilities or disorders. Workshops about disabilities and disorders should be presented by professionals or guest speakers to spread awareness. How can individuals with Autism benefit from museums? What additional features can museums provide as services to the Autism community? In order to examine the benefits that might be offered by museums to individuals with Autism, it is necessary to examine Autism as well as the museum environment. First, an explanation about autism is necessary. Autism is a disorder that affects the individual’s brain before the age of three years, making communication and social skills difficult. It can also influence the individual’s behavior. Boys {{are more likely to have}} autism than girls. Autism is one of the 5 brain disorders that are classified under the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The other 4 brain disorders are: Asperger Syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, Persuasive Developmental Delay-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS), and Rett Syndrome (WebMD). Research implies that there are two critical factors which might cause autism. The first factor is genetic while the second factor is environmental. “Researchers are starting to identify particular genes that may increase <b>the</b> risk <b>for</b> ASD. Still, scientists have only had some success in finding exactly which genes are involved. Most people who develop ASD have no reported 2 ! ! family history of autism, suggesting that random, rare, and possibly many gene mutations are likely to affect a person’s risk. Having increased genetic risk does not mean a child will definitely develop ASD. Many researchers are focusing on how various genes interact with each other and environmental factors to better understand how they increase the risk of this disorder. As with genes, it’s likely that more than one environmental factor is involved in increasing risk for ASD. And, like genes, any one of these risk factors raises the risk by only a small amount. Most people who have been exposed to environmental risk factors do not develop ASD” (NIH). While there is no cure for ASD, treatment options are available. Fortunately, abundant resources are available for families with ASD children. Autism is different from Down’s Syndrome for particular reasons. “Down’s kids tend to be very friendly, happy go-lucky. Autism kids tend to have a bit of anxiety, not knowing what is coming next. They may not appear as friendly or outgoing. The anxiety level overtakes them” (Smith) ...|$|R
