25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{investigation}} {{found that the}} Piper had entered the Los Angeles Terminal Control Area airspace without the required clearance. The TCA included a triangular slab of airspace from 6000ft to 7000ft altitude reaching south to 33.714N 118.007W, across the Piper's intended flight path; the Piper could legally fly beneath this airspace without <b>contacting</b> <b>air</b> traffic controllers, but instead climbed into the TCA. The air traffic controller had been distracted by another unauthorized private flight – a Grumman AA-5 Tiger – entering the TCA directly north of the airfield, that also did not have clearance.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{evaporative}} coolers of gases and fluids {{on the basis}} of monoblock multichannel polymeric structures is presented. Different schemes of indirect evaporative coolers, in which the natural cooling limit is the dew point of the ambient air  are discussed. In such systems the cooling temperature is lower than the wet bulb temperature of the ambient air. Special attention is paid to the recondensation of water vapor for deep evaporative cooling. It is shown that for the solution of the recondensation problem it is necessary to vary the ratio of the <b>contacting</b> <b>air</b> and water flows, particularly in each stage of the multistage system. Recommendations for the deep cooling process implementation in the evaporative coolers of gases and liquids are given. </em...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} the project is two fold: (1) {{examining}} particle size effect on interfacial properties of CWS fuels by measuring static and dynamic surface tension properties of specially prepared CWS samples containing different ranges of coal particle sizes, and (2) studying the effect of particle size on CWS atomization characteristics by measuring mean diameters of several different CWS sprays generated by sonic air blasting. The results show that both static and dynamic surface tensions decrease with increasing coal particle size and mean droplet diameter of CW-S sprays also decreases with increasing coal particle size. Based on the experimental evidence we conjecture that three different energies are competing in slurry atomization: (1) the internal capillary holding between particles and water, (2) the interfacial surface tensile energy at the slurry surface <b>contacting</b> <b>air,</b> and (3) the external air blast shear energy acting against the former two energies. The internal capillary holding force decreases with increasing particle size. This force is believed {{to play a major}} role in determining the effect of particle size on CWS atomization...|$|E
