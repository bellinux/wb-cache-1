40|$|We {{studied the}} Early and early-Mid Holocene {{landscape}} {{at the site}} of Mondeval de Sora, VF 1 (Belluno, N-E Italy), preserving one of the best archaeological records of the Dolomites for this time span. Charcoal analyses are related to sectors I and III located under a dolomite boulder at an altitude of 2, 150 m a. s. l. Samples were systematically picked up through wet sieving all over the stratigraphic sequence during archaeological excavations. For our analysis we sub-sampled 414 charcoals from the estimated total number of ca. 300. 000. The analyzed charcoal come from levels dating to the Sauveterrian and the Castelnovian. They are mainly constituted of larch/spruce, followed by pine, probably mugo pine, and by <b>cembran</b> <b>pine.</b> Broadleaves are rare and represented by green alder. The larch, is more represented than spruce confirming its ability to occupy higher altitudes. <b>Cembran</b> <b>pine,</b> is less represented with respect to larch and spruce...|$|E
40|$|The larch {{bud moth}} (LBM) Zeiraphera diniana Guen√©e causes {{defoliation}} on larch in the Alps at 8 - to 10 -year intervals, after which populations crash. There are two LBM host races, one on larch {{and the other}} on <b>cembran</b> <b>pine.</b> These host races are morphologically indistinguishable as adults but they differ genetically in larval color types. Furthermore, females of each host race produce distinct pheromone blends and show oviposition preferences for their respective hosts. It is not clear to what extent host choice contributes to assortative mating in the LBM. Here, we compare the olfactory sensitivities of the two host races to the odors of fresh foliage of the host plants using the electroantennogram (EAG) technique, and the responses of the two host races to volatiles collected from the two host plants as analyzed by gas-chromatography-linked antennographic detection (GC-EAD). Both sexes of the larch and cembran host races show the same EAG responses to vapors of fresh larch and <b>cembran</b> <b>pine</b> foliage. Fifteen plant volatiles identified as chemostimuli by GC-EAD from larch and <b>cembran</b> <b>pine</b> odors elicited the same antennogram responses from the two host races. However, the GC-EAD analyses indicate that the number and quantity of chemostimuli emanating from each host plant is different. It is, therefore, most probably the array of olfactory receptors responding to the bouquet of volatiles unique to each host plant that underlies the host preferences of the two races. What remains open {{is the extent to which}} the similarity of the olfactory systems may contribute to cross-attraction. The fact that LBM individuals with intermediate characteristics between the two host races exist, suggests that olfactory perception does not hinder gene flow and contributes to sustained genetic diversity within the species Z. diniana...|$|E
40|$|Summary Ecosystem {{simulation}} models {{are designed to}} as-sess the flux of energy, water, carbon and nitrogen according to a given vegetation type. The reliability of the modeled results is determined by model validations. Model validations are typi-cally done using classical statistical methods like regression analysis of predicted versus observed values, paired t statistics and error assessment procedures to characterize the quality of current and future model predictions. All these validation ef-forts concentrate on static aspects of the model but fail to de-scribe the model dynamics. In this paper, we introduce meth-ods from ergodic theory to analyze the dynamic behavior of ecosystem models. We describe (1) how the attractor represen-tation of model behavior can be reconstructed from a time se-ries of model outputs, and (2) what {{we can learn from}} the at-tractor to assess the model dynamics. As an application example, we provide simulation results for two important pine forest ecosystems in Austria, i. e., 23 <b>Cembran</b> <b>pine</b> and 16 Scots pine stands. These stands were simulated with three model parameterizations: one represent-ing a generic, evergreen needle-leaf forest, and two species-specific parameter sets, one for <b>Cembran</b> <b>pine</b> and one for Scots pine. First, we applied standard validation methods to get static measures of model accuracy and precision. Next, we used ergodic theory to assess model dynamics. A comparison of both analyses reveals important issues related to model dy-namics, such as the finding that the occurrence of instabilities in model behavior may not be detected by standard validation methods. Using ergodic theory, we were able to reconstruct the attractors of model behavior. In the attractor describing model dynamics for <b>Cembran</b> <b>pine,</b> simulated with the generic, ever-green needle-leaf forest parameter set, we detected instability in model behavior. We identified this instability as a riddled basin configuration, which is a strong indicator for the occur-rence of a chaotic model behavior that may result in random predictions. Our results suggest that ergodic theory is a useful tool for assessing inconsistencies in the dynamics of ecosys-tem model simulations that have not been detected by standard statistical validation methods...|$|E
