40|$|Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) is a {{promising}} new engine concept. Its successful introduction, however, {{hinges on the}} ability of overcoming several complications. One of these, wall-wetting (i. e. collision and subsequent adhesion of fuel droplets with and to the <b>cold</b> <b>combustion</b> chamber walls), is the result of injecting high-boiling fuels (e. g. Diesel) early in the compression stroke, when temperatures and pressure are still too low to facilitate an expedient vaporization. In order to predict the occurrence of wall-wetting, two fuel spray models (by Siebers [1] and Hiroyasu [2]) were subjected to validation based on experimental data. At the low temperatures, associated with HCCI injection timings, it is found that the Hiroyasu model is more in line with the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|A brief {{overview}} of work carried out by this group on thick (> 1 mu m), optically clear, robust titania films prepared by a sol-gel method, {{as well as new}} results regarding these films, are described. Such films are very active as photocatalysts and able to destroy stearic acid with a quantum yield of 0. 32 %. The activity of such films is largely unaffected by annealing temperatures below 760 degrees C, but is drastically reduced above this temperature. The drop in photocatalyst activity of such films as a function of annealing temperature appears to correlate well with the change in porosity of the films and suggests that the latter parameter is very important in deciding the overall activity of such films. The importance of porosity in semiconductor photocatalysed <b>cold</b> <b>combustion</b> {{may be due to the}} effect it has on access of oxygen to the active sites, rather like the effect the position of a fire grate (open or closed) has on the rate of burning, i. e., hot combustion, that takes place in a fireplace...|$|E

50|$|When {{starting}} from <b>cold,</b> the engine's <b>combustion</b> efficiency is reduced because the cold engine block draws heat {{out of the}} cylinder in the compression stroke. The result is that fuel is not burned fully, resulting in blue and white smoke and lower power outputs until the engine has warmed. This is especially the case with indirect injection engines, which are less thermally efficient. With electronic injection, the timing and length of the injection sequence can be altered to compensate for this. Older engines with mechanical injection can have mechanical and hydraulic governor control to alter the timing, and multi-phase electrically controlled glow plugs, that stay on for a period after start-up to ensure clean combustion; the plugs are automatically switched to a lower power to prevent their burning out.|$|R

Increase in fuel usage efficiency can be obtained by transferring the waste exhaust heat to the <b>cold</b> <b>combustion</b> air. The metallic recuperators currently available suffer from problems of creep, corrosion and oxidation, particularly at high temperatures. The Department of Energy and GTE Products corporation have pursued a jointly funded venture, Contract No. EX- 76 -C-Q 1 - 2162, to establish performance criteria and demonstrate a cross-flow ceramic heat recuperator for high temperature industrial heat recovery applications.

40|$|Unmanned air {{vehicles}} (UAV’s) {{today are}} extensively {{used for a}} wide range of applications, from amateur to human to military applications. Electric propulsion is preferred for small UAV’s, while piston engines and gas turbines are used for the bigger ones. The proposed engine in this work covers the midscale for restart able, low budget vehicles (< 10 kg and 30 - 200 N thrust). Simplicity, durability and manufacturability are the main target goals of the design. The liquid fuelled engine is designed to run on gasoline and ethanol as a fuel and a hydrogen peroxide – water solution as the oxidizer. The advantage of the high energy density of the liquid reactants is counteracted by the difficulty for the ignition of the reactants at low pressures and temperatures, especially at the starting up process. In this work, different nozzles and injection strategies were tested and evaluated under similar conditions that exist at start up of the engine. It has been found that even for reasonable manufacturing process and precision, good atomization can be obtained if a mixture of gas and liquid is premixed prior to injection. This can be realized by catalytic decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide without the need for an extra gas supply circuit. This exothermal reaction provides the additional advantage of injecting a hot mixture in the <b>cold</b> <b>combustion</b> chamber, allowing easier ignition...|$|E
40|$|Thermo{{acoustic}} engines convert {{thermal energy}} into acoustic energy with {{few or no}} moving parts, thus they require little maintenance, are highly reliable, and are inexpensive to produce. These traits make them attractive for applications in remote or portable power generation, where a linear alternator converts the acoustic power into electric power. Their primary application, however, is in driving thermoacoustic refrigerators, which use acoustic power to provide cooling at potentially cryogenic temperatures, also without moving parts. This dissertation examines the feasibility of {{a new type of}} thermoacoustic engine, where mean flow and an internal pulse combustion process replace the hot heat exchanger in a traditional closed cycle thermoacoustic engine, thereby eliminating the heat exchangers cost, inefficiency, and thermal expansion stresses. The theory developed in this work reveals that a large temperature difference must exist between the hot face of the regenerator and the hot combustion products flowing into it, and that much of the convective thermal energy input from the combustion process is converted into conductive and thermoacoustic losses in the regenerator. The development of the Thermoacoustic Pulse Combustion Engine, as described in this study, is designed to recover most of this lost thermal energy by routing the inlet pipes through the regenerator to preheat the combustion reactants. Further, the developed theory shows that the pulse combustion process has the potential to add up to 7 % to the engines acoustic power output for an acoustic pressure ratio of 10 %, with linearly increasing contributions for increasing acoustic pressure ratios. Computational modeling and optimization of the Thermoacoustic Pulse Combustion Engine yield thermal efficiencies of about 20 % for atmospheric mean operating pressures, though higher mean engine pressures increase this efficiency considerably by increasing the acoustic power density relative to the thermal losses. However, permissible mean engine pressures are limited by the need to avoid fouling the regenerator with condensation of water vapor out of the <b>cold</b> <b>combustion</b> products. Despite lower acoustic power densities, the Thermoacoustic Pulse Combustion Engine is shown to be well suited to portable refrigeration and power generation applications, due to its reasonable efficiency and inherent simplicity and compactness.

Recent experimental results indicate the feasibility of capture by direct injection into hot combustion products at temperatures that do not thermodynamically favor the absorption of sulfur by the limestone. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analytically investigate possible explanations of observed capture with the goal of evaluating the feasibility of direct limestone injection sulfur capture in emerging coal utilization systems. The method was to use current available data on the physical properties of limestone and the rates of the pertinent reactions, and to develop a mathematical model of the process experienced by the injected particles. The models were then used to predict extent of capture at the high-pressure, high-temperature, short residence time condition of interest. The goal was to first investigate capture in a single-pulse reactor (combustion bomb) and then to extrapolate these results to advanced coal-fired heat engine combustion environments. Model predictions were in good agreement with observed sulfur capture in <b>cold</b> wall <b>combustion</b> bomb studies and suggest that efficient sulfur capture (in excess of 80 percent calcium utilization) may be possible when limestone sorbents are injected into high-temperature combustion products, even when the gas temperatures exceed the thermodynamically favored temperature window by several hundred kelvins.

40|$|Gas {{turbine engines}} {{are widely used}} to provide {{propulsion}} in aircraft and for power generation on land and sea. Currently, engine manufacturers are working to reduce the emission of environmentally harmful combustion products by operating these engines under lean conditions (with more air than is needed for complete combustion). However, such operating conditions can make the combustion process unstable, resulting in large, potentially damaging pressure and heat release oscillations, which need to be understood. This project is aimed at improving our understanding of this unstable process by making experimental measurements in a model annular combustor (modern gas turbines almost exclusively use annular architecture). The thesis work involves controlling a number of loudspeakers and the analysis of pressure measurements (using LabVIEW and MATLAB) to determine the modes and amplitudes of oscillation in an annular combustion chamber. The thesis therefore {{is a mix of}} experimental, analytical and computational work.

Indeed, the simulation of combustion flow showed strong dependence on turbulence flow model and turbulent combustion model choice. The best combustion simulation result with SST k-ω turbulence flow model and EDM turbulence combustion model has good agreement with experimental wall pressure data, but the pressure peak location is slightly deviated.

40|$|Road {{transportation}} sector faces nowadays {{the challenge}} of satisfying the growing demands for mobility {{and at the same}} time to reduce its negative impact on environment. The panorama for the future is to reduce to zero the tank-to-wheel emissions levels with electric vehicles. Nevertheless, the extended use and massive production of this kind of vehicles is compromised due to different factors. On the one hand, the technology has to keep evolving in order to improve its reliability and to reduce acquisition costs. And on the other hand, cities, legislations and users have to get ready in order to make an appropriate use of these vehicles. What will happen in short and medium term is the transition from current vehicles, powered by internal combustion engines, to 100 % electric cars. For this transition, diesel engines will continue having an extended use, or even more, due to their capacity of accomplishing with emissions legislations with low fuel consumption. To be competitive, diesel engine technology has to continue improving in order to satisfying markets requirements being respectful with environment. Cold start is one of the most problematic combustion phases for diesel engines. During this phase, a large proportion of pollutants are produced within the cylinder due to misfiring and incomplete combustion due to the low engine temperatures. Furthermore, exhaust after-treatment devices work inefficiently since their minimum operation temperatures cannot be reached. In addition to this, at temperatures below 0 ºC the possibility of continuous misfiring could actually impede the engine start. This is the combustion phase on which this study has been focused.

40|$|The {{combination}} of emulsified diesel and low temperature combustion (LTC) technology has great potential in reducing engine emissions. A visualization {{study on the}} spray and combustion characteristics of water emulsified diesel was conducted experimentally in a constant volume chamber under conventional and LTC conditions. The effects of ambient temperature on the evaporation, ignition and combustion characteristics of water emulsified diesel were studied under <b>cold,</b> evaporating and <b>combustion</b> conditions. Experimental {{results showed that the}} ambient temperature had little effect on the spray structures, in terms of the liquid core length, the spray shape and the spray area.

The auto-ignition delay time increased significantly with the decrease of the ambient temperature. The ignition process always occurred at the entrainment region near the front periphery of the liquid core. This entrainment region was evolved from the early injected fuel droplets which were heated and mixed by the continuous entrainment until the local temperature and equivalence ratio reached the ignition condition. The maximum value of integrated natural flame luminosity (INFL) reduced by 60 % when the ambient temperature dropped from 1000 to 800 K, indicating a significant decrease of the soot emissions could be achieved by LTC combustion mode than the conventional diesel engines...|$|R

This probe is weakly fluorescent, but yields strong fluorescence emission upon radical trapping or redox activity. Samples {{were collected by}} bubbling aerosol through an impinger containing BPEAnit solution, followed by fluorescence measurement. The fluorescence of BPEAnit was measured for particles produced during various combustion phases, {{at the beginning of}} burning (<b>cold</b> start), stable <b>combustion</b> after refilling with the fuel (warm start) and poor burning conditions. For particles produced by the logwood stove under cold-start conditions significantly higher amounts of reactive species per unit of particulate mass were observed compared to emissions produced during a warm start. In addition, sampling of logwood burning emissions after passing through a thermodenuder at 250 oC resulted in an 80 - 100 % reduction of the fluorescence signal of BPEAnit probe, indicating that the majority of reactive species were semivolatile. Moreover, the amount of reactive species showed a strong correlation with the amount of particulate organic material. This indicates the importance of semivolatile organics in particle-related toxicity.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the present study is to assess the effect of mass {{transfer}} on the formation of unburned HC and CO emissions in HCCI engines. A multi-zone model was modified and used for this purpose. The new feature of the multi-zone model is its ability to switch between two distinct simulation modes, i. e. either including or excluding mass transfer between zones. The switch between modes occurs at a user-defined point in the engine closed cycle. Apart from mass transfer, the two modes use identical sub-models for the heat transfer between zones and to the cylinder wall and for combustion simulation, which is modeled using a reduced set of chemical reactions coupled with a chemical kinetics solver. Using the modified multi-zone model, four cases were simulated and compared: one including mass transfer throughout the closed cycle, and three cases whereby mass transfer is neglected after the initiation of the 1 st or 2 nd heat release or after the completion of main heat release. The simulation results reveal that mass transfer affects the HC and CO accumulated at the <b>colder</b> regions during <b>combustion</b> and governs the HC partial oxidation and CO production during expansion. For the operating conditions studied, neglecting mass transfer during combustion results to an underprediction of HC by as much as 50 % and of CO by 45 % relative to the case where mass transfer is considered for. Omitting mass transfer only during expansion, results to an overestimation of HC by 9 % and to an underestimation of CO by 26 %. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

One aspect of the NGLT effort is to explore the potential of incorporating non-toxic propellants for Reaction Control Subsystems (RCS). Contract NAS 8 - 01109 has been issued to Aerojet to develop a dual thrust Reaction Control Engine (RCE) that utilizes liquid oxygen and ethanol as the propellants. The dual thrust RCE incorporates a primary thrust level of 870 lbf, and a vernier thrust level of 10 - 30 lbf.

The objective of the ignition testing was to demonstrate successfid ignition from GOX to LOX, encompassing potential two-phase flow conditions. The workhorse igniter was designed to accommodate the full LOX design flowrate, as well as a reduced GOX flowrate. It was reasoned that the initial LOX flow through the igniter would flash to GOX due to the inherent heat stored in the hardware, causing a reduced oxygen flowrate because of a choked, or sonic, flow condition through the injection elements. As LOX flow continued, the inherent heat of the test hardware would be removed and the hardware would chill-in, with the injected oxygen flow transitioning from cold GOX through two-phase flow to subcooled LOX. Pressure and temperature instrumentation permitted oxygen state points to be determined, and gas-side igniter chamber thermocouples provided chamber thermal profile characteristics. The cold flow chamber pressure (P(sub c)) for each test was determined and coupled with the igniter chamber diameter (D(sub c)) to calculate the characteristic quench parameter (P(sub c) x D(sub c)), which was plotted as a function of core mixture ratio, MR(sub c).

40|$|The {{depletion}} of fossil fuel reserve and {{the fluctuation of}} oil prices in the global market have triggered global awareness and interest in developing alternative fuels. Fossil fuel {{has become a major}} environment concern due to its detrimental pollution effect.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current thesis work could be basically summarized as {{the realization of the}} flight version designs for the injector assembly and the combustion chamber head of a 500 N liquid bipropellant rocket engine. The work is embedded in the German Space Administration(DLR) -STERN project “SMART ROCKETS” consisting in the design, manufacture and flight campaign of a Liquid Oxygen-Ethanol propelled rocket. Both design problems were carried on in parallel, with the aim of not only realize a functional design capable of satisfying the driving requirements, but also amenable of being incorporated in the evolving engine concept, whose components interface features represent crucial aspects for the whole assembly realization and validation. The path toward the definition of the flight version coaxial swirl injector started with the characterization of the existing test injectors built within the project, based on existing flow models and experimental data gained through a series of <b>cold</b> flow and <b>combustion</b> tests. Those tests evidenced that the available fluid dynamic models, based on the strong hypothesis of inviscid flow, were only capable of accurately describe the behavior of the oxidizer injector while gave unacceptable prediction errors for the fuel injector, leading to the difficulty in find a reliable massflow-pressure correlation for the injection assembly. Therefore the focus shifted in enhancing the flow model including the viscosity effects believed to be the reason of the fuel injector discharge capability drop. The characterization of the Boundary Layer structure inside the swirl injector chamber under some simplifying hypotheses brought to a close form analytical solution of the viscous swirler problem. Thus, further cold flow tests were planned and conducted in order to verify the validity of the obtained solution: the test results matched with great accuracy the predictions of the built viscous model over a wide range of measurements, leading to the assessment of the enhanced injector flow model and the building of the operative map for both injectors. This gave the possibility to design the flight version injectors meeting the baselined requirements. The definition of the flight version combustion chamber head also started considering the analysis of the current project process: the interface nature of this element forced its design to be subject to several constraints coming from the other subsystems development. The optimization process of the flight version focused on the choice of the combination of geometric and material features of the designed concept, facing the compromise between weight saving and thermal-structural integrity. The use of lightweight materials such Aluminum alloys seemed to be the most promising solution for a lightweight design and an active cooling strategy has been implemented in order for the lightweight structure to withstand the thermal loads coming from combustion. A thermal model has been built for the convective heat transfer of burning gases and coolant beside the injector plate and coupled with a structural analysis, through which the optimum “leading thickness” of the structure has been obtained as the outcome of a thermal/stress analytical optimization, then validated through the use of FEM codes. Tuned the interface features together with the other mattering subsystems, a final lightweight design has been assessed with the choice of a High Temperature Aluminum Alloy, ready to be manufactured and capable of satisfying both thermal-structural and interface requirements...|$|R

One such technology was to determine the viability of incorporating non-toxic propellants for R eaction Control Subsystems (RCS). Contract NAS 8 - 01109 was issued to A erojet to develop a dual thrust Reaction Control Engine (RCE) that ut ilized liquid oxygen and ethanol as the propellants. The dual thrust RCE incorporated a primary thrust level of 870 lbf, and a vernier thru st level of 10 - 30 lbf. The preferred RCS approach for the dual thru st RCE was to utilize pressure-fed liquid oxygen (LOX) and ethanol pr opellants; however, previous dual thrust feasibility testing incorporated GOX/Ethanol igniters as opposed to LOX/Ethanol igniters in the de sign. GOX/Ethanol was easier to ignite, but this combination had syst em design implications of providing GOX for the igniters. A LOX/Ethan ol igniter was desired; however, extensive LOX/Ethanol ignition data over the anticipated operating range for the dual thrust RCE did not e xist. Therefore, Aerojet designed and tested a workhorse LOX igniter to determine LOX/Ethanol ignition characteristics as part of a risk m itigation effort for the dual thrust RCE design. The objective of the ignition testing was to demonstrate successful ignition from GOX to LOX, encompassing potential two-phase flow conditions anticipated being present in real mission applications. A workhorse igniter was desig ned to accommodate the full LOX design flowrate, as well as a reduced GOX flowrate. It was reasoned that the initial LOX flow through the igniter would flash to GOX due to the latent heat stored in the hardwa re, causing a reduced oxygen flowrate because of a choked, or sonic, flow condition through the injection elements. As LOX flow continued, the hardware would chill-in, with the injected oxygen flow transitioning from cold GOX through two'phase flow to subcooled LOX. The Workh orse igniter was well instrumented: Pressure and temperature instrumentation permitted oxygen state points to be determined in the igniter oxidizer manifold, and gas-side igniter chamber thermocouples provide d chamber thermal profile characteristics. The cold flow chamber pres sure (Pc) for each test was determined and coupled with the igniter chamber diameter (De) to calculate the characteristic quench parameter (Pc x Dc), which was plotted as a function of core mixture ratio, MRc. Ignition limits were determined over a broad range of valve inlet conditions, and ignition was demonstrated with oxygen inlet conditions that ranged from subcooled 210 deg R LOX to 486 deg R GOX. Once ign ited at <b>cold</b> GOX conditions, <b>combustion</b> was continuous as the hardwar e chilled in and the core mixture ratio transitioned from values near 1. 0 to over 12. 5. Pulsing is required in typical RCS engines; therefore, the workhorse igniter was pulse tested to verify the ability to pr ovide the required ignition for a pulsing RCE. The minimum electrical pulse width (EPW) of the dual thrust RCE was 0. 080 seconds. Igniter pulse tests were performed at three conditions: (1) an EPW of 0. 080 se conds at 25 % duty cycle for 400 pulses; (2) an EPW of 0. 160 seconds a nd a 5 % duty cycle for 124 pulses; (3) an EPW of 0. 160 seconds and a 50 % duty cycle for 380 pulses. Successful ignition of LOX/Ethanol was demonstrated over a broad range of valve inlet conditions, with the empirically determined LOX/Ethanol ignition limits extending the previous database established for GOX/Ethanol ignition limits. Although th e observed chill-in characteristics of the hardware varied significan tly with flowrate, ignition was readily achieved. Combustion was marg inal at extremely fuel-rich conditions, and it fluctuated as the oxygen passed rough the twophase flow regime during the period of hardware chill-in. Pulse testing showed good repeatability with 100 percent r e-ignition for all pulses. Certain pulse-to-pulse repeatability requirements for actual RCS operation may necessitate establishment of mini mum oxygen flow rates and engine thrust levels for satisfactory engin e performance...|$|R
