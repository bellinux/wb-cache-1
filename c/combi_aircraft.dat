5|$|In October 2010, Pemco World Air Services and Precision Conversions {{launched}} aftermarket conversion {{programs to}} modify 757-200s into 757 <b>Combi</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Vision Technologies Systems launched {{a similar program}} in December 2011. All three aftermarket conversions modify the forward portion of the aircraft to provide room for up to ten cargo pallets, while leaving the remaining space to fit around 45 to 58 passenger seats. This configuration is targeted at commercial charter flights which transport heavy equipment and personnel simultaneously. Customers for converted 757 <b>Combi</b> <b>aircraft</b> include the Air Transport Services Group, National Airlines, and North American Airlines.|$|E
5|$|Founded {{concurrently}} {{with the}} passenger operations of EVA Air, EVA Air Cargo operates facilities in Europe, Asia, and North America. Its cargo operations have diversified to include transportation of high-tech equipment and special care {{items such as}} museum artwork and live zoological specimens. EVA Air has stated its goal of achieving a 50/50 split in revenues between its passenger and cargo operations. The airline's cargo operations are mainly operated via a fleet of Boeing 747-400, MD-11 dedicated freighters, Boeing 747-400 <b>Combi</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and additional belly cargo space on passenger aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} of 328 {{allows for}} a comfortable three-abreast airline-style seating arrangement {{to be used as}} well as a dense four-abreast configuration to accommodate greater passenger numbers, of which it is able to carry a maximum of 27. There are a total of six cabin configurations available for passenger and cargo operations, these include a flexible <b>combi</b> <b>aircraft</b> layout with a movable wall separating passengers and cargo, and a medical evacuation arrangement equipped with bio-floors and positions for four litters and medical attendees. The 328 is pressurized, a first for Dornier-built aircraft, which was implemented to achieve a higher level of passenger comfort; the passenger cabin is designed to be more akin to those of much larger passenger aircraft. A full-sized galley, toilet and washbasin can also be installed.|$|E
50|$|Flights {{were soon}} {{established}} to Johannesburg, South Africa, {{in conjunction with}} South African Airways; Yorks assigned to this route outfitted {{with a total of}} 12 sleeping berths in addition to passenger seating due to the journey time. The majority of BOAC's York fleet were fully furnished passenger airliners or as <b>combi</b> passenger-cargo <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
50|$|The airline {{began its}} life as Interior Airways in late 1946 {{carrying}} cargo throughout the American territory of Alaska. In the late 1960s the airline bought Lockheed L-382 Hercules aircraft to service {{construction of the}} Alaska Pipeline. In 1972 it {{changed its name to}} Alaska International Air to reflect its international charter business. In 1980 Alaska International Air bought a regional passenger/cargo airline named Great Northern Airways. In 1984 new colors and the name MarkAir (reportedly named after a newsboy named Mark) were brought to the airline as it inaugurated passenger/cargo service from Anchorage to the Alaska bush communities of Barrow, Bethel, Dillingham, Fairbanks, King Salmon, Kotzebue, Nome, and Prudhoe Bay/Deadhorse. The airline had purchased Boeing 737-200 <b>Combi</b> cargo/passenger <b>aircraft</b> to operate these services.|$|R
50|$|The Beech 99 {{was sold}} in 2005, a fourth Hawker Siddeley 748 {{acquired}} in 2006, and {{in the summer of}} 2008 a Boeing 737-200 combi was acquired, with its large main deck cargo door and moveable bulkhead allowing all-cargo as well as mixed cargo/passenger operations with the 737. Soon after a gravel kit was also installed on the 737 <b>Combi,</b> allowing the <b>aircraft</b> to operate on the airline's northern routes and expand charter capabilities.|$|R
2500|$|In 1973, Sergio Orlandini was {{appointed}} to succeed Gerrit van der Wal as president of KLM. At the time, KLM, {{as well as other}} airlines, had to deal with overcapacity. Orlandini proposed to convert KLM 747s to [...] "combis" [...] that could carry a combination of passengers and freight in a mixed configuration on the main deck of the aircraft. In November 1975, the first of these Boeing 747-200B <b>Combi</b> <b>aircraft</b> were added to the KLM fleet. [...] The airline previously operated DC-8 passenger and freight <b>combi</b> <b>aircraft</b> as well and currently operates Boeing 747-400 <b>combi</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|E

50|$|Scheduled {{commercial}} airline service {{is provided by}} PenAir, a code share partner of Alaska Airlines. At one point Alaska Airlines operated Boeing 737-200 Combi jetliners to the airport with these aircraft transporting a combination of passengers and freight on the main deck of the aircraft. However, due to load restrictions {{as a result of}} the short runway as well as cancellations due to weather, Alaska Airlines then contracted the service via a code sharing arrangement to PenAir in 2004. PenAir currently operates Saab 340 and Saab 2000 regional turboprop aircraft into the airport. AirPac also previously served the airport with British Aerospace BAe 146-100 jets with this aircraft type having enhanced short runway takeoff and landing performance. The airfield runway is 4,100 feet long which is quite short for jet operations when compared with typical runways normally used by mainline jet aircraft. Other airlines that served the airport in the past included MarkAir operating Boeing 737-200 <b>Combi</b> jet <b>aircraft</b> and Reeve Aleutian Airways flying Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprops via a code sharing agreement with Alaska Airlines.|$|R
2500|$|A [...] {{long haul}} road connects the mine to the mine's port {{site on the}} Chukchi Sea. The mine and port site are {{accessible}} only by air, except during the 100-day shipping season. The mine's airport, known as Red Dog Airport, provides the main access. Mine workers from remote villages {{in the region are}} ferried to the mine on small aircraft. Alaska Airlines is contracted by the mine to fly other mine workers out of Anchorage. Until 2007, gravel-strip capable Boeing 737-200 <b>Combi</b> <b>aircraft</b> were used. These ships have a cargo door in the front part of the aircraft and a separate rear passenger cabin. In 2005 the runway was paved, in anticipation of newer Boeing 737-400 <b>Combi</b> <b>aircraft</b> which are not equipped to land on gravel.|$|E
2500|$|The Boeing 727 {{would become}} the {{backbone}} of the Braniff fleet and the trijet was the key aircraft in the 1971 Fleet Standardization Plan, which called for three aircraft types: the Boeing 727 primarily operated on domestic services, the Boeing 747 for Hawaii, and the Douglas DC-8 for South America. This Lawrence plan would lower operating costs; when Lawrence took office in May 1965, Braniff operated no less than thirteen different aircraft types. Braniff eventually ordered several variants of the 727 including the [...] "quick change" [...] cargo/passenger <b>Combi</b> <b>aircraft</b> variant, the stretched 727-200, and later the 727-200 Advanced. Lawrence also increased utilization of the fleet.|$|E
2500|$|Although Braniff {{had been}} one of the first U.S. {{operators}} of the British-built BAC One-Eleven (and the first U.S. airline to order the British Aircraft Corporation twin jet), in 1965 Lawrence ordered twelve new US-built Boeing 727-100s and cancelled most of the remaining One-Eleven orders. The 727s had been selected before Lawrence's arrival, but no orders had been placed. These planes were the [...] "quick change" [...] (B727-100QC) model, which had a large freight loading door located on one side of the aircraft just aft of the flight deck. This allowed Braniff to begin late-night cargo service, while the aircraft carried passengers during the day. This doubled the 727 utilization rate and allowed Braniff to open a new cargo business, AirGo. The new 727s could also be outfitted in a mixed cargo/passenger <b>Combi</b> <b>aircraft</b> configuration if needed and Braniff did operate [...] "red eye" [...] overnight services carrying cargo in the forward section with seating for 51 passengers in the rear coach compartment of the jetliner.|$|E
