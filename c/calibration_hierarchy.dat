50|$|A {{national}} metrology institute's (NMI) {{role in a}} country's {{measurement system}} is to conduct scientific metrology, realise base units, and maintain primary national standards. An NMI provides traceability to international standards for a country, anchoring its national <b>calibration</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> For a national measurement system to be recognized internationally by the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement, an NMI must participate in international comparisons of its measurement capabilities. The BIPM maintains a comparison database {{and a list of}} calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs) of the countries participating in the CIPM MRA. Not all countries have a centralised metrology institute; some have a lead NMI and several decentralised institutes specialising in specific national standards.|$|E
40|$|A new DC current {{reference}} standard {{has been developed}} as a component in a Current <b>calibration</b> <b>hierarchy</b> in the LHC project at CERN. The standard provides 10 mA DC current with an accuracy less than 0. 5 ppm, drift less than 2 ppm/year and compliance error less than 0. 1 ppm for 0 - 10 V. The paper gives the results from two years evaluation {{of a series of}} 5 units...|$|E
40|$|The {{certification}} of {{the purity of}} CRMs intended for calibration, where no other certified material already exists for comparison raises principle questions on how to determine the purity of a "first" calibrant in the <b>calibration</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> We developed and certified two CRMs for their purity in thyroid hormones (thyroxine (thyroxine, T 4) and 3, 3 ', 5 -triiodothyronine (T 3)) taking into consideration inorganic residues, residual solvents and organic impurities detectable by HPLC-UV and HPLC-MS. The approach we used aims to determine the purity of these two CRMs {{to the best of}} our knowledge and taking all scientific aspects properly into account for the estimation of an uncertainty related to the stated purity.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{metrological}} traceability of measurement results to property values assigned to measurement standards of higher metrological order {{or to the}} International System of Units (SI) through sequential calibrations, using reference materials and reference measurement procedures, {{plays a key role}} in ensuring that end user measurement procedures perform at an acceptable level in the clinical context. The aim is that measurement results produced over time or by different end users or with different end user measurement procedures for the same measurand will be equivalent within their corresponding uncertainties. These goals can only be reached under certain conditions and if requirements laid down in international standards on calibration concepts, reference measurement procedures and reference materials are fulfilled. <b>Calibration</b> <b>hierarchies</b> have to be implemented correctly and parameters contributing to measurement uncertainty and systematic bias need to be controlled and eliminated, respectively, by technically improving methods and reference materials and intermediate calibrators used for effectively achieving equivalence of measurement results and for meeting analytical performance requirements for in vitro diagnostic devices.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for the cost-effective determination of appropriate measurement assurance standards and practices {{for the management}} of calibration and test equipment. The methodology takes an integrated approach in which quality, measurement reliability and costs at each level in a test and <b>calibration</b> support <b>hierarchy</b> are linked to their counterparts at every other level in the hierarchy. This relates requirements and capabilities at any given level in the hierarchy to the performance objectives of the end items which the hierarchy is ultimately employed to support. Included in the methodology is the capability to quantify the effect of calibration/test support on costs resulting from the risk of degraded end item performance, either in terms of losses suffered through poor performance or expenses incurred from returned products, warranty rework or reimbursement, legal damages, or retrofit of product improvements...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, {{transition}} rules used in urban CA models are reviewed and classified into two categories: transition potential rules {{and conflict resolution}} rules. Then, four widely used rule elicitation methods: Regression analysis, Artificial Neural network (ANN), Visual <b>calibration,</b> and Analytical <b>Hierarchy</b> Processing - Multi Criteria Evaluation (AHP-MCE) are discussed. Most of these methods are data driven methods {{and can be used}} to elicit the transition potential rules in the urban CA models. In the following, three possible rule elicitation methods:  Interview, Document analysis, and Card sorting are explained and demonstrated. These three methods are driven by knowledge and can be used to elicit conflict resolution rules as well as transition potential rules in urban CA models...|$|R
40|$|Quality and {{uncertainty}} requirements for reference materials and measurement procedures {{based on the}} ISO Guide 30 - 35 series and ISO 15194 and ISO 15193, respectively will be described. The impact of uncertainties related to values assigned to reference materials and reference measurement procedures and implications for the calibration / traceability chain will be addressed. The eventual need to reduce uncertainties based on clinical performance requirements should not lead to underestimation of uncertainty and omission of significant uncertainty components but rather to higher quality reference materials and measurement procedures {{as well as to}} adaptations of the <b>calibration</b> <b>hierarchy</b> in terms of reduction of the number of calibration steps and associated uncertainties.

40|$|Abstract The medical {{laboratory}} must provide {{results of measurements}} that are comparable over space and {{time in order to}} aid medical diagnosis and therapy. Thus, metrological traceability, preferably to the SI, is necessary. The task is formidable due to the many disciplines involved, the high production rate, short request-toreport time, small sample volumes, microheterogeneity of many analytes, and complex matrices. The prerequisite reference measurement systems include definition of measurand, unit of measurement (when applicable), consecutive levels of measurement procedures and calibrators in a <b>calibration</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> international organizations, reference measurement laboratories, dedicated manufacturers, written standards and guides for the {{medical laboratory}}, production of reference materials, internal and external quality control schemes, and increasingly accreditation. The present availability of reference measurement procedures and primary calibrators is shown to be insufficient to obtain international comparability of all types of quantity in laboratory medicine...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a method to calculate the fractional distribution of CO 2 across all of its component isotopologues based on measured δ 13 C and δ 18 O values. The fractional distribution {{can be used with}} known total CO 2 to calculate the amount of substance fraction (mole fraction) of each component isotopologue in air individually. The technique is applicable to any molecule where isotopologue-specific values are desired. We used it with a new CO 2 calibration system to account for isotopic differences among the primary CO 2 standards that define the WMO X 2007 CO 2 -in-air calibration scale and between the primary standards and standards in subsequent levels of the <b>calibration</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> The new calibration system uses multiple laser spectroscopic techniques to measure mole fractions of the three major CO 2 isotopologues (16 O 12 C 16 O, 16 O 13 C 16 O, and 16 O 12 C 18 O) individually. The three measured values are then combined into total CO 2 (accounting for the rare unmeasured isotopologues), δ 13 C, and δ 18 O values. The new calibration system significantly improves our ability to transfer the WMO CO 2 calibration scale with low uncertainty through our role as the World Meteorological Organization Global Atmosphere Watch Central Calibration Laboratory for CO 2. Our current estimates for reproducibility of the new calibration system are ± 0. 01  µmol mol − 1  CO 2, ± 0. 2  ‰ δ 13 C, and ± 0. 2  ‰ δ 18 O, all at 68  % confidence interval (CI) ...|$|E
40|$|Metrology {{management}} and technical personnel have long puzzled over determining appropriate quality assurance standards and practices for effective management of calibration and test equipment. Such standards and practices include accuracy ratio criteria, measurement reliability (percent in-tolerance) targets, test tolerance limits vs. performance tolerance limits, "significant " out-of-tolerance points, and equipment adjustment or renewal policy. This paper reports on recent developments which promise {{to yield a}} user capability for establishing these standards and practices in a rigorous and cost effective manner. The analytical methodology is structured {{in such a way}} that quality, reliability and cost requirements and parameters at each level in the test and <b>calibration</b> support <b>hierarchy</b> are linked to their counterparts at every other level in the hierarchy by an integrated infrastructure model. This relates requirements and capabilities at any given level in the hierarchy to the performance objectives of the end items which the hierarchy is established to ultimately support. Through use of the integrated model, the impact of decisions at any level on test decision risks, calibration intervals and support costs at other levels in the hierarchy is computed. Included in the model is the capability to quantify the effect of calibration/test support quality on costs resulting from the risk of degraded end item performance, either in terms of loses suffered through poor performance or expenses incurred from returned products, warranty rework or reimbursement, legal damages, or retrofit of product improvements...|$|R
