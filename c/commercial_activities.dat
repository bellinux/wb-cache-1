5|$|Mosley {{came up with}} an {{innovative}} way to dispose of the FIA's involvement in the <b>commercial</b> <b>activities</b> of Formula One. In order to maintain Ecclestone's investment to deliver digital television, he proposed extending Ecclestone's rights for F1 coverage to 100 years from the initial 15, arguing that a deal of such length could not be anti-competition as it was effectively the same as an outright sale. The Commission agreed with his assessment and in the interest of impartiality, Mosley removed himself from the negotiations, which eventually returned around $300 million (£150 million).|$|E

5|$|All the same, between 1853 and the 1930s, fiscal {{instability}} was a transitory phenomenon. The depressions of 1873–77 and 1890–91 {{played a}} crucial role in fostering the rise of industry: timidly in the 1870s and more decisively in the 1890s, industry grew with each crisis in response to the need of a damaged economy to improve its trade balance through import-substitution. By 1914, about 15% the Argentine labour force was involved in manufacturing, compared to 20% involved in <b>commercial</b> <b>activities.</b> In 1913, the country's income per head was on a par with that of France and Germany, and far ahead of Italy's or Spain's.

Denok, a military-controlled firm, monopolised some of East Timor's most lucrative <b>commercial</b> <b>activities,</b> including sandal wood export, hotels, and the import of consumer products. The group's most profitable business, however, was its monopoly on the export of coffee, which was the territory's most valuable cash crop. Indonesian entrepreneurs came to dominate non-Denok/military enterprises, and local manufactures from the Portuguese period made way for Indonesian imports.|$|E

The FIA released the Statement {{to the media and}} held a press conference in Brussels ridiculing the Commission’s case. The Commission argued that a number of commercial agreements could be viewed as anti-competition and invited the FIA and Ecclestone's companies, ISC and FOA, to submit proposals to modify these arrangements.

5|$|In 1967, {{efforts were}} {{initiated}} to avert Belfast expected scrapping and to preserve {{her as a}} museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum, and the Ministry of Defence were established and then reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971, the government decided against preservation, prompting {{the formation of the}} private HMS Belfast Trust to campaign for her preservation. The efforts of the Trust were successful, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971. Brought to London, she was moored on the River Thames near Tower Bridge in the Pool of London. Opened to the public in October 1971, Belfast became a branch of the Imperial War Museum in 1978. A popular tourist attraction, Belfast receives over {{a quarter of a million}} visitors per year.

5|$|The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 {{established}} full Norwegian {{sovereignty over}} the archipelago. The islands are, unlike the Norwegian Antarctic Territory, {{a part of}} the Kingdom of Norway and not a dependency. The treaty came into effect in 1925, following the Svalbard Act. All forty signatory countries of the treaty have the right to conduct <b>commercial</b> <b>activities</b> on the archipelago without discrimination, although all activity is subject to Norwegian legislation. The treaty limits Norway's right to collect taxes to that of financing services on Svalbard. Therefore, Svalbard has a lower income tax than mainland Norway, and there is no value added tax. There is a separate budget for Svalbard to ensure compliance. Svalbard is a demilitarized zone, as the treaty prohibits the establishment of military installations. Norwegian military activity is limited to fishery surveillance by the Norwegian Coast Guard as the treaty requires Norway to protect the natural environment.|$|E
5|$|By 1999, Lillehammer Olympiapark had {{an annual}} revenue of NOK20 million, {{of which a}} third came from the fund. <b>Commercial</b> <b>activities</b> contributed half the revenue, while the {{remaining}} fraction came from sports activities. Between 80 and 90 percent of the rental time went to sports activities. A report published by Lillehammer University College in 2007 concluded that all the 260 permanent jobs created in the Lillehammer area {{as a result of}} the Olympics were directly dependent on subsidies from the post-Olympic use funds. In the late 2000s, Lillehammer Olympiapark was using between NOK8 and 12 million per year. There was NOK25 million left in the fund in 2012, which was scheduled to be closed in 2014, after it has served for 20 years. Lillehammer Olympiapark started planning the organization of the venues in 2010. The company recommended that the subsidies be equally funded between Lillehammer Municipality, Oppland County Municipality and the Ministry of Culture. Specifically it recommended that the state take over ownership of the bobsleigh and luge track, while the county took partial ownership of Lillehammer Olympiapark. The state would thus continue to finance the track, which is the only such venue in Northern Europe, while the municipality and county finance the other four venues. The venues are recommended held to such a standard that they can host world cup and world championships in relevant sports.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} Han period, rural peasant farmers were largely self-sufficient, but {{they began to}} rely heavily upon {{commercial}} exchanges with the wealthy landowners of large agricultural estates. Many peasants subsequently fell into debt and were forced to become either hired laborers or rent-paying tenants of the land-owning classes. The Han government continually strove to provide economic aid to poor farmers, who had to compete with powerful and influential nobles, landowners, and merchants. The government tried to limit the power of these wealthy groups through heavy taxation and bureaucratic regulation. Emperor Wu's (r. 141–87 BC) government even nationalized the iron and salt industries; however, these government monopolies were repealed during Eastern Han. Increasing government intervention in the private economy during the late 2nd century BC severely weakened the commercial merchant class. This allowed wealthy landowners to increase their power and to ensure the continuation of an agrarian-dominated economy. The wealthy landlords eventually dominated <b>commercial</b> <b>activities</b> as well, maintaining control over the rural peasants—upon whom the government relied for tax revenues, military manpower, and public works labor. By the 180s AD, economic and political crises had caused the Han government to become heavily decentralized, while the great landowners became increasingly independent and powerful in their communities.|$|E

Being the administrative headquarters of the Tiruvannamalai district, Tiruvannamalai {{has a lot of}} tertiary sector activities. Trade and commerce and service activities are the major contributors to the economy of the town. In 1991, 7.93% of the population was involved in primary sector, 21.34% in secondary sector and 70.73% in tertiary sector activities. The town had a female work participation of 11%. Due to the urbanisation from 1971, there has been dip in primary sector activities and a proportional increase in the tertiary sector activities. There is limited agricultural activity within the town limits. The secondary sector involves manufacturing and construction, whose growth has remained stable over the decades. There are a number of oil mills, rice mills and agro based industries within the Tiruvannamalai town limits. The tertiary sector activities of trade, commerce, transport, storage, communication and other services has been increasing due to the increasing number of tourists to the town.
