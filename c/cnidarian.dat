5|$|The {{earliest}} {{widely accepted}} animal fossils are rather modern-looking cnidarians, possibly from around , although fossils from the Doushantuo Formation {{can only be}} dated approximately. The identification {{of some of these}} as embryos of animals has been contested, but other fossils from these rocks strongly resemble tubes and other mineralized structures made by corals. Their presence implies that the <b>cnidarian</b> and bilaterian lineages had already diverged. Although the Ediacaran fossil Charnia used to be classified as a jellyfish or sea pen, more recent study of growth patterns in Charnia and modern cnidarians has cast doubt on this hypothesis, leaving only the Canadian polyp, Haootia, as the only bona-fide <b>cnidarian</b> body fossil from the Ediacaran. Few fossils of cnidarians without mineralized skeletons are known from more recent rocks, except in lagerst√§tten that preserved soft-bodied animals.|$|E
5|$|All known {{cnidaria}} can reproduce asexually {{by various}} means, {{in addition to}} regenerating after being fragmented. Hydrozoan polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. Scyphozoan polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition to both of these methods, Anthozoa can split horizontally just above the base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter <b>cnidarian</b> a clone of the adult.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cnidarian</b> sexual {{reproduction}} often involves a complex life cycle with both polyp and medusa stages. For example, in Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies) a larva swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally {{into a series}} of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called strobilation. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have gonads in the gastroderm, and these release ova and sperm into the water in the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|However, in 2005 Katja Seipel and Volker Schmid {{suggested}} that <b>cnidarians</b> and ctenophores are simplified descendants of triploblastic animals, since ctenophores and the medusa stage of some <b>cnidarians</b> have striated muscle, which in bilaterians {{arises from the}} mesoderm. They did not commit themselves on whether bilaterians evolved from early <b>cnidarians</b> or from the hypothesized triploblastic ancestors of <b>cnidarians.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Fossil <b>cnidarians</b> {{have been}} found in rocks formed about [...] Fossils of <b>cnidarians</b> that do not build mineralized {{structures}} are rare. Scientists currently think <b>cnidarians,</b> ctenophores and bilaterians are more closely related to calcareous sponges than these are to other sponges, and that anthozoans are the evolutionary [...] "aunts" [...] or [...] "sisters" [...] of other <b>cnidarians,</b> and the most closely related to bilaterians.|$|R
500|$|Recent phylogenetic {{analyses}} support monophyly of <b>cnidarians,</b> {{as well as}} {{the position}} of <b>cnidarians</b> as the sister group of bilaterians. [...] Fossil <b>cnidarians</b> have been found in rocks formed about , and other fossils show that corals may have been present shortly before [...] and diversified a few million years later. However, molecular clock analysis of mitochondrial genes suggests a much older age for the crown group of <b>cnidarians,</b> estimated around , almost 200 million years before the Cambrian period as well as any fossils.|$|R
5|$|Dopamine {{is used as}} a {{neurotransmitter}} in most multicellular animals. In sponges {{there is}} only a single report of the presence of dopamine, with no indication of its function; however, dopamine has been reported in the nervous systems of many other radially symmetric species, including the <b>cnidarian</b> jellyfish, hydra and some corals. This dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of the nervous system, over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian era. Dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs form {{some of the}} world's most {{productive}} ecosystems. Common coral reef cnidarians include both Anthozoans (hard corals, octocorals, anemones) and Hydrozoans (fire corals, lace corals). The endosymbiotic algae of many <b>cnidarian</b> species are very effective primary producers, in other words converters of inorganic chemicals into organic ones that other organisms can use, and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently. In addition, reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support {{a wide range of}} other organisms. Fringing reefs just below low-tide level also have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high-tide level and sea grass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.|$|E
5|$|Most turbellarians have pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes"), {{one pair}} in most species, but two or even three pairs in some. A few large species have many eyes in {{clusters}} over the brain, mounted on tentacles, or spaced uniformly {{around the edge}} of the body. The ocelli can only distinguish the direction from which light is coming and enable the animals to avoid it. A few groups have statocysts, fluid-filled chambers containing a small, solid particle or, in a few groups, two. These statocysts are thought to be balance and acceleration sensors, as that is the function they perform in <b>cnidarian</b> medusae and in ctenophores. However, turbellarian statocysts have no sensory cilia, and how they sense the movements and positions of the solid particles is unknown. On the other hand, most have ciliated touch-sensor cells scattered over their bodies, especially on tentacles and around the edges. Specialized cells in pits or grooves on the head are probably smell sensors.|$|E
5|$|Like sponges and <b>cnidarians,</b> ctenophores {{have two}} main layers of cells that {{sandwich}} a middle layer of jelly-like material, {{which is called}} the mesoglea in <b>cnidarians</b> and ctenophores; more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly-like layer. Hence ctenophores and <b>cnidarians</b> have traditionally been labelled diploblastic, along with sponges. Both ctenophores and <b>cnidarians</b> have a type of muscle that, in more complex animals, arises from the middle cell layer, {{and as a result}} some recent text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic, while others still regard them as diploblastic.|$|R

25|$|Velella, the by-the-wind sailor, is a <b>cnidarian</b> with {{no means}} of {{propulsion}} other than sailing. A small rigid sail projects {{into the air and}} catches the wind. Velella sails always align along the direction of the wind where the sail may act as an aerofoil, so that the animals tend to sail downwind at a small angle to the wind.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear receptors are {{specific}} to metazoans (animals) and are not found in protists, algae, fungi, or plants. Amongst the early-branching animal lineages with sequenced genomes, two have been reported from the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica, two from the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi four from the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens and 17 from the <b>cnidarian</b> Nematostella vectensis. There are 270 nuclear receptors in the nematode C. elegans alone. Humans, mice, and rats have respectively 48, 49, and 47 nuclear receptors each.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cnidarians</b> were {{formerly}} grouped with ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata, but increasing {{awareness of}} their differences caused them {{to be placed in}} separate phyla. <b>Cnidarians</b> are classified into four main groups: the almost wholly sessile Anthozoa (sea anemones, corals, sea pens); swimming Scyphozoa (jellyfish); Cubozoa (box jellies); and Hydrozoa, a diverse group that includes all the freshwater <b>cnidarians</b> as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members, such as Hydra, and colonial swimmers, such as the Portuguese Man o' War. Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa were only firmly recognized as <b>cnidarians</b> in 2007.|$|R
25|$|Hastings {{research}} on bioluminescence principally focused on bacterial luminescence (over 150 papers) and dinoflagellates (over 80 papers). In addition to bacteria and dinoflagellates, he, with his students and colleagues, also published {{papers on the}} biochemical and molecular mechanisms of light production in fungi, cnidarians, ctenophores, polychaetes, insects (fireflies and dipterans), ostracod crustaceans, millipedes, tunicates, and fishes with bacterial light organs. His laboratory produced the first evidence for quorum sensing in bacteria, early evidence of the molecular mechanisms of circadian clock regulation in organisms (first using dinoflagellate luminescence and then expanded to other cellular proteins), {{and some of the}} initial studies of energy transfer in green fluorescent proteins (GFP) in <b>cnidarian</b> luminescence.|$|E
25|$|In biology, a medusa (plural: medusae) {{is a form}} of <b>cnidarian</b> {{in which}} the body is shaped like an umbrella, in {{contrast}} with polyps. Medusae vary from bell-shaped to the shape of a thin disk, scarcely convex above and only slightly concave below. The upper or aboral surface is called the exumbrella and the lower surface is called the subumbrella; the mouth is located on the lower surface, which may be partially closed by a membrane extending inward from the margin (called the velum). The digestive cavity consists of the gastrovascular cavity and radiating canals which extend toward the margin; these canals may be simple or branching, and vary in number from few to many. The margin of the disk bears sensory organs and tentacles.|$|E
25|$|Several other {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} domesticated, both terrestrial and aquatic, including {{some such as}} Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies and the freshwater <b>cnidarian</b> Hydra for research into genetics and physiology. Few {{have a long history}} of domestication. Most are used for food or other products such as shellac and cochineal. The phyla involved are Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes (for biological control), Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda (marine crustaceans as well as insects and spiders), and Echinodermata. While many marine molluscs are used for food, only a few have been domesticated, including squid, cuttlefish and octopus, all used in research on behaviour and neurology. Terrestrial snails in the genera Helix and Murex are raised for food. Several parasitic or parasitoidal insects including the fly Eucelatoria, the beetle Chrysolina, and the wasp Aphytis are raised for biological control. Conscious or unconscious artificial selection has many effects on species under domestication; variability can readily be lost by inbreeding, selection against undesired traits, or genetic drift, while in Drosophila, variability in eclosion time (when adults emerge) has increased.|$|E

500|$|He {{described}} the Vendobionta as quilted cnidarians lacking stinging cells. This absence precludes the current <b>cnidarian</b> method of feeding, so Seilacher {{suggested that the}} organisms may have survived by symbiosis with photosynthetic or chemoautotrophic organisms. Mark McMenamin saw such feeding strategies as characteristic for the entire biota, and referred to the marine biota of this period as a [...] "Garden of Ediacara".|$|E
500|$|Some {{biologists}} {{have attempted to}} disarm triactinomyxon spores by making them fire prematurely. [...] In the laboratory, only extreme acidity or basicity, moderate to high concentrations of salts, or electric current caused premature filament discharge; neurochemicals, <b>cnidarian</b> chemosensitizers, and trout mucus were ineffective, as were anesthetized or dead fish. [...] If spores could be disarmed, they {{would be unable to}} infect fish, but {{further research is needed to}} find an effective treatment.|$|E
500|$|Many corals, as well {{as other}} <b>cnidarian</b> groups such as [...] Aiptasia (a sea anemone) form a {{symbiotic}} relationship with a class of dinoflagellate algae, zooxanthellae of the genus Symbiodinium. Aiptasia, a familiar pest among coral reef aquarium hobbyists, serves as a valuable model organism in the study of cnidarian-algal symbiosis. Typically, each polyp harbors one species of algae. Via photosynthesis, these provide energy for the coral, and aid in calcification. As much as 30% of the tissue of a polyp may be algal material.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cnidarians</b> {{were for}} a long time grouped with Ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata, but {{increasing}} awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Modern <b>cnidarians</b> are generally classified into four main classes: sessile Anthozoa (sea anemones, corals, sea pens); swimming Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies); and Hydrozoa, a diverse group that includes all the freshwater <b>cnidarians</b> as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members such as Hydra and colonial swimmers such as the Portuguese Man o' War. Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa are now recognized as highly derived <b>cnidarians</b> rather than more closely related to the bilaterians.|$|R
50|$|Primnoa wingi is {{a species}} of <b>cnidarians.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{molecular}} phylogenetics analyses from 2005 onwards, important {{groups of}} developmental genes {{show the same}} variety in <b>cnidarians</b> as in chordates. In fact <b>cnidarians,</b> and especially anthozoans (sea anemones and corals), retain some genes that are present in bacteria, protists, plants and fungi but not in bilaterians.|$|R
500|$|The {{majority}} of animals {{more complex than}} jellyfish and other Cnidarians are split into two groups, the protostomes and deuterostomes. The mollusc-like features of Kimberella strongly suggest {{that it was a}} member of the protostomes. If so, this means that the protostome and deuterostome lineages must have split some time before Kimberella appeared ‚Äî at least , and hence well before the start of the Cambrian [...] Even if it is not a protostome, it is widely accepted as a member of the more inclusive bilaterian clade. Since fossils of rather modern-looking Cnidarians have been found in the Doushantuo lagerst√§tte, the <b>Cnidarian</b> and bilaterian lineages would have diverged well over [...]|$|E
500|$|Many cnidarians {{are limited}} to shallow waters because they depend on endosymbiotic algae for much of their nutrients. The life cycles of most have polyp stages, which {{are limited to}} {{locations}} that offer stable substrates. Nevertheless, major <b>cnidarian</b> groups contain species that have escaped these limitations. Hydrozoans have a worldwide range: some, such as Hydra, live in freshwater; Obelia appears in the coastal waters of all the oceans; and Liriope can form large shoals near the surface in mid-ocean. Among anthozoans, a few scleractinian corals, sea pens and sea fans live in deep, cold waters, and some sea anemones inhabit polar seabeds while others live near hydrothermal vents over [...] below sea-level. Reef-building corals are limited to tropical seas between 30¬∞N and 30¬∞S with a maximum depth of , temperatures between [...] and [...] high salinity and low carbon dioxide levels. Stauromedusae, although usually classified as jellyfish, are stalked, sessile animals that live in cool to Arctic waters.|$|E
500|$|Within the Cnidaria, the Anthozoa (sea anemones and corals) are {{regarded}} as the sister-group of the rest, {{which suggests that the}} earliest cnidarians were sessile polyps with no medusa stage. However, it is unclear how the other groups acquired the medusa stage, since Hydrozoa form medusae by budding {{from the side of the}} polyp while the other Medusozoa do so by splitting them off from the tip of the polyp. The traditional grouping of Scyphozoa included the Staurozoa, but morphology and molecular phylogenetics indicate that Staurozoa are more closely related to Cubozoa (box jellies) than to other [...] "Scyphozoa". Similarities in the double body walls of Staurozoa and the extinct Conulariida suggest that they are closely related. The position of Anthozoa nearest the beginning of the <b>cnidarian</b> family tree also implies that Anthozoa are the cnidarians most closely related to Bilateria, and this is supported by the fact that Anthozoa and Bilateria share some genes that determine the main axes of the body.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cnidarians</b> form {{an animal}} phylum {{that are more}} complex than sponges, about as complex as ctenophores (comb jellies), and less complex than bilaterians, which include almost all other animals. However, both <b>cnidarians</b> and ctenophores are more complex than sponges as they have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. <b>Cnidarians</b> are distinguished from all other animals by having cnidocytes that fire like harpoons and are used mainly to capture prey. In some species, cnidocytes {{can also be used}} as anchors.|$|R
5|$|Most <b>cnidarians</b> prey on organisms {{ranging in}} size from {{plankton}} to animals several times larger than themselves, but many obtain much of their nutrition from dinoflagellates, and a few are parasites. Many are preyed on by other animals including starfish, sea slugs, fish, turtles, and even other <b>cnidarians.</b> Many scleractinian corals‚Äîwhich form the structural foundation for coral reefs‚Äîpossess polyps that are filled with symbiotic photo-synthetic zooxanthellae. While reef-forming corals are almost entirely restricted to warm and shallow marine waters, other <b>cnidarians</b> can be found at great depths, in polar regions, and in freshwater.|$|R
