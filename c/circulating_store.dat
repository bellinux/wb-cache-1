The constraint system, FT£, provides information-ordering constraints interpreted over feature trees. Based on this approach, we show how a generalization of FT£ combined with path constraints can be used to formally represent and state constraints and reason over semistructured data. The proposed query language is extended to facilitate query relaxation when the exact solution to the query cannot be obtained from the data repository.

40|$|The {{development}} {{of information and}} communication technologies has multiplied our ability to produce, <b>circulate</b> and <b>store</b> large amounts of data. Over the last twenty years databases have become an essential part of biomedical research. For these databases to operate effectively, a link has to be made between very small amounts of biological material (only a few microlitres) and a wide range of personal data relating to the donors (age, sex, occupation, lifestyle, diet, etc.) and their state of health (clinical and biological data). Yet most studies on bioinformatics databases take this link for granted, as if it emerged naturally and automatically from the data collection process. However, the relationship between samples and data does not emerge in and of itself. This paper shows that the solidity of the link between different types of data is based on the daily work of writing. It also shows that ‘information' is not the starting point of the work.

40|$|There {{are more}} and more third-generation {{synchrotron}} radiation (SR) facilities in the world that utilize low emittance electron (or positron) beam circulating in a storage ring to generate synchrotron light for various types of experiments. A storage ring based SR facility consists of an injector, a storage ring, and many SR beamlines. When compared to other types of accelerator facilities, the design and practices for radiation safety of storage ring and SR beamlines are unique to SR facilities. Unlike many other accelerator facilities, the storage ring and beamlines of a SR facility are generally above ground with users and workers occupying the experimental floor frequently. The users are generally non-radiation workers and do not wear dosimeters, though basic facility safety training is required. Thus, the shielding design typically aims for an annual dose limit of 100 mrem over 2000 h without the need for administrative control for radiation hazards. On the other hand, for operational and cost considerations, the concrete ring wall (both lateral and ratchet walls) is often desired to be {{no more than a few}} feet thick (with an even thinner roof). Most SR facilities have similar operation modes and beam parameters (both injection and stored) for storage ring and SR beamlines. The facility typically operates almost full year with one-month start-up period, 10 -month science program for experiments (with short accelerator physics studies and routine maintenance during the period of science program), and a month-long shutdown period. A typical operational mode for science program consists of long periods of <b>circulating</b> <b>stored</b> beam (which decays with a lifetime in tens of hours), interposed with short injection events (in minutes) to fill the stored current. The stored beam energy ranges from a few hundreds MeV to 10 GeV with a low injection beam power (generally less than 10 watts). The injection beam energy can be the same as, or lower than, the stored beam energy. However, the stored beam power (product of stored beam current and energy), which is one of the key parameters in determining the production and hazards of gas bremsstrahlung (GB) and SR in beamlines, is quite high (MW to GW levels). Because of the similar design and dose control goals as well as similar beam parameters and operation modes among SR facilities, it is highly desired and useful for SR accelerator community to have the design and practices for radiation safety of the storage ring and SR beamlines that are professionally sound and consistent. On the other hand, it can be understood that a SR facility may need to have its specific policies and practices, due to its own technical, practical, economical and/or political considerations...|$|R

40|$|Although iron is {{essential}} for living organisms to survive, its reactive properties require strict regulation {{in order to prevent}} toxic effects. Hepcidin, a liver produced peptide hormone, is thought to be the central regulator of body iron metabolism. Its production is mainly controlled by the erythropoietic activity of the bone-marrow, the amount of <b>circulating</b> and <b>stored</b> body iron, and inflammation. Recent reports, however, provide new hypotheses on how hepcidin might exert its regulatory function. Although hepcidin was first discovered in human urine and serum, most of our understanding of hepcidin regulation and action comes from in vitro and mice studies that often use hepcidin mRNA expression as a read out.

The recent development of assays to measure hepcidin in serum and urine has offered new opportunities to study hepcidin regulation in humans. However, for the moment, only a small number of laboratories are able to perform these assays. The aim of this review is to discuss insights into hepcidin regulation obtained from recent clinical studies in the light of findings from in vitro and mice studies.

Here, we experimentally demonstrated the Brillouin scattering induced transparency (BSIT) in a high quality optical microresonantor.

40|$|Some organisms {{can adapt}} to {{seasonal}} {{and other environmental}} challenges by entering a state of dormancy, diapause. Thus, insects exposed to decreased temperature and short photoperiod enter a state of arrested development, lowered metabolism, and increased stress resistance. Drosophila melanogaster females can enter a shallow reproductive diapause in the adult stage, which drastically reduces organismal senescence, but {{little is known about}} the physiology and endocrinology associated with this dormancy, and the genes involved in its regulation. We induced diapause in D. melanogaster and monitored effects over 12 weeks on dynamics of ovary development, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as well as expression of genes involved in endocrine signaling, metabolism and innate immunity. During diapause food intake diminishes drastically, but <b>circulating</b> and <b>stored</b> carbohydrates and lipids are elevated. Gene transcripts of glucagon- and insulin-like peptides increase, and expression of several target genes of these peptides also change. Four key genes in innate immunity can be induced by infection in diapausing flies, and two of these, drosomycin and cecropin A 1, are upregulated by diapause independently of infection. Diapausing flies display very low mortality, extended lifespan and decreased aging of the intestinal epithelium. Many phenotypes induced by diapause are reversed after one week of recovery from diapause conditions. Furthermore, mutant flies lacking specific insulin-like peptides (dilp 5 and dilp 2 - 3) display increased diapause incidence.

Scaling laws that relate these sets of sequences resemble those observed in linguistics and other branches of inquiry, and dynamics reminiscent of neural networks are observed.

Additionally, histopathological studies were conducted to better understand the dynamics of ontogenic development of both helminths in the host and the possible biochemical effects. Co-infections by helminths and other parasites often occur due to the wide distribution of helminths and the chronic nature of the infection. The biochemical parameters were measured {{at the end of the}} seventh week after exposure. The co-infection resulted in a significant decrease in the total proteins concentration in the hemolymph of snails as well as an increase in the nitrogen excretion products, these results showed that the infection leads to exhaustion of free <b>circulating</b> and <b>stored</b> carbohydrates and the infected snails make use alternative substrates, such as free amino acids. So, the protein degradation to release free amino acids causes a decrease in the content of total proteins in the snail host and an amino acids deamination process, increasing the content of ammonium, which needs to be detoxified. This occurs by increasing the urea and uric acid contents. This observation is corroborated by the increase of ALT and AST activities, enzymes directly related to amino group from an amino acid to an α-ketoacid an important step to generate new carbon skeleton for glucose synthesis de novo, as well as new intermediates to the Krebs cycle. Additionally, reduction in the recovery of L 3 from the co-infected group (A+E) was observed, since in this association the burden was higher than in the other.

40|$|Skeletal {{muscle is}} a major mass {{peripheral}} tissue that accounts for similar to 40 % of the total body mass and {{a major player in}} energy balance. It accounts for > 30 % of energy expenditure, is the primary tissue of insulin stimulated glucose uptake, disposal, and storage. Furthermore, it influences metabolism via modulation of <b>circulating</b> and <b>stored</b> lipid (and cholesterol) flux. Lipid catabolism supplies up to 70 % of the energy requirements for resting muscle. However, initial aerobic exercise utilizes stored muscle glycogen but as exercise continues, glucose and stored muscle triglycerides become important energy substrates. Endurance exercise increasingly depends on fatty acid oxidation (and lipid mobilization from other tissues). This underscores the importance of lipid and glucose utilization as an energy source in muscle. Consequently skeletal muscle has a significant role in insulin sensitivity, the blood lipid profile, and obesity. Moreover, caloric excess, obesity and physical inactivity lead to skeletal muscle insulin resistance, a risk factor for the development of type II diabetes. In this context skeletal muscle is an important therapeutic target in the battle against cardiovascular disease, the worlds most serious public health threat. Major risk factors for cardiovascular disease include dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and diabetes. These risk factors are directly influenced by diet, metabolism and physical activity. Metabolism is largely regulated by nuclear hormone receptors which function as hormone regulated transcription factors that bind DNA and mediate the pathophysiological regulation of gene expression. Metabolism and activity, which directly influence cardiovascular disease risk factors, are primarily driven by skeletal muscle. Recently, many nuclear receptors expressed in skeletal muscle have been shown to improve glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and dyslipidernia. Skeletal muscle and nuclear receptors are rapidly emerging as critical targets in the battle against cardiovascular disease risk factors. Understanding the function of nuclear receptors in skeletal muscle has enormous pharmacological utility for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. This review focuses on the molecular regulation of metabolism by nuclear receptors in skeletal muscle in the context of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease.

Among the major changes found were a further rise in the mean fasting serum free fatty acid (FFA) level to three times the control mean value and a 50 % drop in the mean serum triglyceride (TG) concentration after the intravascular administration of a single bolus of virus compared to levels found in uninfected or convalescent animals. In adipose tissue, hormone-sensitive and lipoprotein lipase activities were increased six and three-fold, respectively, over mean control values, probably accounting for the changes that were observed in serum lipid concentrations. In the liver, total carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) activity was affected only slightly and the total lipid content of the liver remained unchanged. These findings indicate that 24 h after the intravascular dissemination of homologous virus in a single bolus during convalescence from influenza B infection, major distortions in the regulation of lipid metabolism occur in the ferret.

40|$|The {{response}} to tyramine of the denervated nictitating membrane has been analysed by comparing dose/response curves obtained by injections into the femoral vein {{and into the}} carotid artery of the spinal cat while recording contractions of innervated and chronically denervated membranes and those of cats treated with reserpine. It is concluded {{that the effect of}} tyramine given by these routes is due primarily to catechol amines released from stores within the nictitating membrane itself. Higher doses of tyramine also cause contraction of the membrane by liberating catechol amines into the <b>circulating</b> blood from <b>stores</b> outside the membrane. The {{response to}} tyramine of the nictitating membrane after chronic denervation and/or prior treatment with reserpine is partially due to catechol amines released from unidentified stores within the membrane which resist depletion by reserpine and by postganglionic denervation; evidence is presented that adrenaline rather than noradrenaline is concerned. Because of the high sensitivity of the denervated nictitating membrane to adrenaline and to noradrenaline, the response to these amines released from stores outside the membrane by intravenous injections of tyramine becomes greater than that of the normal membrane. Dose/response curves obtained from responses to intravenous sympathomimetic drugs which act away from the membrane are therefore not fully representative of the effect of the drugs on the membrane itself.

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms is positively correlated with the level of <b>circulating</b> or <b>stored</b> toxic metals, and that excretion of these heavy metals, brought about by the use of pharmaceutical chelating agents, results in improved symptoms. OBJECTIVES: To assess the potential benefits and adverse effects of pharmaceutical chelating agents (referred to as chelation therapy throughout this review) for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases on 6 November 2014 : CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process, Embase,PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and 15 other databases, including three trials registers. In addition we checked references lists and contacted experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials of pharmaceutical chelating agents compared with placebo in individuals with ASD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed them for risk of bias and extracted relevant data. We did not conduct a meta-analysis, as only one study was included. MAIN RESULTS: We excluded nine studies because they were non-randomised trials or were withdrawn before enrolment. We included one study, which was conducted in two phases. During {{the first phase of the}} study, 77 children with ASD were randomly assigned to receive seven days of glutathione lotion or placebo lotion, followed by three days of oral dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). Forty-nine children who were found to be high excreters of heavy metals during phase one continued on to phase two to receive three days of oral DMSA or placebo followed by 11 days off, with the cycle repeated up to six times. The second phase thus assessed the effectiveness of multiple doses of oral DMSA compared with placebo in children who were high excreters of heavy metals and who received a three-day course of oral DMSA. Overall, no evidence suggests that multiple rounds of oral DMSA had an effect on ASD symptoms. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review included data from only one study, which had methodological limitations. As such, no clinical trial evidence was found to suggest that pharmaceutical chelation is an effective intervention for ASD. Given prior reports of serious adverse events, such as hypocalcaemia, renal impairment and reported death, the risks of using chelation for ASD currently outweigh proven benefits. Before further trials are conducted, evidence that supports a causal link between heavy metals and autism and methods that ensure the safety of participants are needed.

40|$|Brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF) {{is a major}} orchestrator of exercise-induced brain plasticity and circulating (peripheral) BDNF may have central effects. Approximately 99 % of circulating BDNF is platelet-bound, and at rest ~ 30 % of <b>circulating</b> platelets are <b>stored</b> in the spleen. Interestingly, forearm handgrip exercise significantly elevates sympathetic outflow and {{has been shown to}} induce splenic constriction, suggesting that small muscle mass exercise could stand as a viable strategy for increasing circulating BDNF; however, the BDNF response to handgrip exercise is currently unknown. Purpose: This study examined BDNF and platelet responses to short-duration maximal (ME) and prolonged submaximal (SE) effort handgrip exercise. Methods: Healthy males (n = 18; 21. 4 ± 2. 1 years, BMI 25. 0 ± 1. 0 kg/m 2) performed 10 min of ME and 30 min of SE. Blood was sampled for the determination of serum BDNF and platelet count at rest and during the last minute of exercise. Results: Compared to rest, serum BDNF significantly increased during ME (21. 2 %) and SE (11. 2 %), which displayed a non-significant trend toward an intensity-dependent response. Platelets increased in an intensity-dependent fashion compared to rest with an 8. 0 % increase during ME and 3. 1 % during SE, and these responses were significantly correlated with diastolic blood pressure responses to handgrip exercise. Further, the amount of BDNF per platelet significantly increased compared to rest during ME (13. 4 %) and SE (8. 7 %). Conclusions: Handgrip exercise evokes significant increases in serum BDNF and platelets, implicating splenic constriction as a key mechanism and confirming efficacy of this exercise model for elevating circulating BDNF...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{resonators}} are {{structures that}} allow light to <b>circulate</b> and <b>store</b> energy for a duration of time. This work primarily {{looks at the}} fabrication, characterization, and application of whispering gallery mode microresonators and the analysis of organic photonic crystal-like structures and simulation of their resonant effects. Whispering gallery mode (WGM) microresonators are a class of cylindrically symmetric optical resonator which light circulates around the equator of the structure. These resonators are named after acoustic whispering galleries, where a whisper can be heard anywhere along the perimeter of a circular room. These optical structures {{are known for their}} ultra high Q-factor and their low mode volume. Q-factor describes the photon lifetime in the cavity and is responsible for the energy buildup within the cavity and sharp spectral characteristics of WGM resonators. The energy buildup is ideal for non-linear optics and the sharp spectral features are beneficial for sensing applications. Characterization of microbubble resonators is done by coupling light from a tunable laser source via tapered optical fiber into the cavity. The fabrication of quality tapered optical fiber on the order of 1 - 2 μm is critical to working on WGM resonators. The measurement of Q-factors up to 2 x 10 ⁸ and mode spectra are possible with these resonators and experimental techniques. This work focuses on microdisk and microbubble WGM resonators. The microdisk resonators are fabricated by femtosecond laser micromachining. The micromachined resonators are fabricated by ablating rotating optical fiber to generate the disk shape and then heated to reflow the surface to improve optical quality. These resonators have a spares mode spectrum and display a Q factor as high as 2 x 10 ⁶. The microbubble resonators are hollow microresonators fabricated by heating a pressurized capillary tube which forms a bubble in the area exposed to heat. These have a wall thickness of 2 - 5 μm and a diameter of 200 - 400 μm. Applications in pressure sensing and two-photon fluorescence of dye in microbubble resonators is explored. Photonic crystals can have engineered resonant properties by tuning photonic band gaps and introducing defects to create cavities in the photonic structure. In this work, a natural photonic crystal structure is analyzed in the form of diatoms. Diatoms are a type of phytoplankton which are identified by unique ornamentation of each species silica shell, called a frustule. The frustule is composed of a quasi-periodic lattice of pores which closely resembles manmade photonic crystals. The diatom frustules are analyzed using image processing techniques to determine pore-to-pore spacing and identify defects in the quasi-periodic structure which may contribute to optical filtering and photonic band gap effects. The data gathered is used to simulate light propagation through the diatom structure at different incident angles and with different material properties and to verify data gathered experimentally...|$|R

Significant blood clearance from iron and ferritin using wet cupping therapy (WCT) has been reported. WCT is an excretory form of treatment that needs more research efforts. WCT is an available, safe, simple, economic, and time-saving outpatient modality of treatment {{that has no}} serious side effects. There are no serious limitations or precautions to discontinue WCT. Interestingly, WCT has solid scientific and medical bases (Taibah mechanism) that explain its effectiveness in treating many disease conditions differing in etiology and pathogenesis. WCT utilizes an excretory physiological principle (pressure-dependent excretion) that resembles excretion through renal glomerular filtration and abscess evacuation. WCT exhibits a percutaneous excretory function that clears blood (through fenestrated skin capillaries) and interstitial fluids from pathological substances without adding a metabolic or detoxification burden on the liver and the kidneys. Interestingly, WCT was reported to decrease serum ferritin (<b>circulating</b> iron <b>stores)</b> significantly by about 22. 25 % in healthy subjects (in one session) and to decrease serum iron significantly {{to the level of}} causing iron deficiency (in multiple sessions). WCT was reported to clear blood significantly of triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, uric acid, inflammatory mediators, and immunoglobulin antibodies (rheumatoid factor). Moreover, WCT was reported to enhance the natural immunity, potentiate pharmacological treatments, and to treat many different disease conditions. There are two distinct methods of WCT: traditional WCT and Al-hijamah (WCT of prophetic medicine). Both start and end with skin sterilization. In traditional WCT, there are two steps, skin scarification followed by suction using plastic cups (double S technique); Al-hijamah is a three-step procedure that includes skin suction using cups, scarification (shartat mihjam in Arabic), and second skin suction (triple S technique). Al-hijamah is a more comprehensive technique and does better than traditional WCT, as Al-hijamah includes two pressure-dependent filtration steps versus one step in traditional WCT. Whenever blood plasma is to be cleared of an excess pathological substance, Al-hijamah is indicated. We will discuss here some reported hematological and therapeutic benefits of Al-hijamah, its medical bases, methodologies, precautions, side effects, contraindications, quantitative evaluation, malpractice, combination with oral honey treatment, and to what extent it may be helpful when treating thalassemia and other conditions of iron overload and hyperferremia.

40|$|Background: Sulfotransferase is an {{important}} enzyme family that catalyses the transfer of a sulfate group from a donor substrate, 3 '-phosphoadenosine- 5 '-phosphosulphate (PAPS), to an acceptor substrate which may be a drug, a hormone or a neurotransmitter that possesses a hydroxy or an amine group. Drugs and hormones are sulfated in human fetal tissues but a review on this topic {{has not yet been}} published. Aims: The aim {{of this article is to}} review the literature on the sulfation of drugs and hormones in human fetus and, when possible, to compare the rate of sulfation in fetal and adult human tissues. Study design: A medline search was performed by using the following key words: "fetal sulfotransferase" and "sulfotransferase in fetus" with the limit of "human". The Literature was collected, critically read and a written note was produced. Subjects: The majority of studies were conducted with mid-gestation human fetuses and limited studies include younger and older fetuses. Results: The sulfation rate of dopamine (SULT 1 A 3) was 3 -fold higher in fetal than adult liver whereas the sulfation rate of 4 -nitrophenot (SULT 1 A 1) was one order of magnitude lower in fetal than adult liver. Ritodrine is sulfated at a higher rate in the fetal than adult liver. The sulfation rates of dopamine, 4 -nitrophenot and ritodrine varied considerably in the fetal liver and did not correlate with the gestation age. 3, 3 '-T- 2 was sulfated in human placenta and the suffation rate of 3, 3 '-T- 2 correlated with SULT 1 A 1 activity. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase activity is 6 -fold higher in the fetal than adult adrenal. Discussion: Sulfotransferase activity develops early in the human fetal liver and is subjected to a remarkable interindividual variability. Because of this variability, the examined enzyme activities did not correlate with the gestation age. Hormones are extensively sulfated in human fetal liver and other tissues. Sulfated hormones may serve as <b>circulating</b> or intracellular <b>stores</b> from which the free hormone can be regenerated by the action of the sulfatases. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the current interest in ‘art activism’ (Grindon 2010), {{and the relationship}} between artistic expression and civil disobedience. Boris Groys has argued that the lack of political dissidence within contemporary art is not down to the ineffectiveness of the aesthetic, but the far more effective intrusion of the aesthetic by the political (Groys 2008). As such, the political question of civil disobedience is necessarily an aesthetic one. At the same time, this raises problems for how politically effective artistic dissidence can be. As Grindon argues, if art activism often only mimics ‘real’ social activism, it remains within the boundaries of the gallery system with no real consequences (2010 : 11). Most art activism fails to be effective civil disobedience, in this sense, as it already operates within the confines of pre-established curatorial spaces. As such, the use of art for the purposes of civil disobedience cannot be, then, mere aestheticism, but rather must act as ‘an insight into the transformed mechanisms of conquest’ (Groys, in Abdullah & Benzer 2011 : 86) : a conflict over the topology of disobedience which exposes the interrelation of aesthetics and politics through medium, space and archive. This paper critically assesses attempts in contemporary art to re-appropriate the symbolic dimension of dissidence as an aesthetic; in particular the use of militancy, asceticism and dissidence as an attempt to move beyond mere counter-political protest and towards a reclaiming of aesthetics from the intrusions of politics. It uses as a specific case example Militant Training Camp, a social experimental performance camp held at Arcadia Missa Gallery in London, March 2012. This weeklong performance piece was designed to explore the activity and mind-set of militant groups and the idea of non-pacifist activity within wider social movements. Engaging with not only the tradition of anarchist activism, but also more recent artistic engagements with civil disobedience (such as the Yes Men; Avaaz. org; Bike Bloc), the camp involved a residential ascetic ‘training programme’ followed by a series of violent performances open to the public, often disturbing other sites of protest such as Anarchist theatres and Occupy sites in the process. The paper uses first-hand documentary evidence and critical reflection on the event in order to argue that, as both an act of civil disobedience, and an exploration of the limits of its aesthetic treatment, the event raises two specific issues surrounding the notion of disobedience and its conceptual possibilities. The first issue is the representation of rage within the context of art activism. Here, the performance is discussed with particular reference to Sloterdijk’s arguments that argues that militancy and revolt operate under a ‘thymotic economy’ (2010 : 58). However, Sloterdijk’s re-appropriation of the thymotic – a conceptualising of ‘rage’ which is not absorbed within the sublimination of psychology or Habermasian symbolism – is not as simple as offering an alternative, ‘non-symbolic’ rage. Given that modern militancy is always subject to containment (the ‘civility’ of civil disobedience), the second issue raised is the formative role of ‘curating’ acts of disobedience. Using the work of Groys on aesthetics and power, the paper assesses how ‘events’ of civil disobedience such as Militant Training Camp are located, represented, <b>circulated</b> and even <b>stored,</b> {{and the ways in which}} they might resist their reduction to or supplementing of a further economy (be it symbolic, banal or simply pious) which conceals the formative ‘rage’ of disobedience...|$|R
40|$|Summary of main {{findings}} When adipose tissue {{is present in}} excessive amounts, as in obesity, it predisposes {{to a number of}} pathologies. Obesity is a complex, multifactorial condition as it influences many endogenous genetic, endocrine, and inflammatory pathways. Excess dietary intake is one of the important factors which are responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity. For the understanding of the reciprocity between consumed diet and excessive amounts of adipose tissue, it is essential to investigate underlying functioning. In this thesis, I have addressed three important aspects that {{play a role in the}} development of diet induced obesity and its pathologies with a focus on adipose tissue metabolism.   Does a body weight set-point exist?   How is the diet-induced metabolic response affected by housing at thermoneutrality?   Does oxygen restriction induce inflammation in white adipose tissue?   The first aspect investigated was the existence of a body weight set point. A body weight set point is defined as a pre-determined or preferred level of body weight which is preserved by an internal feedback control mechanism. In chapter 2, a dietary intervention with none, one, or two diet alterations of purified diets was performed in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice to investigate if a long lasting effect on body weight persistence was present. Diets contained equal protein content and source of ingredients but differed in the fat-to-sugar ratio. Therefore, energy content and amount of fat was different for either the low fat diet or the high fat. In the intervention the last consumed diet of the mice determined energy intake, energy expenditure, body weight, body fat <b>stores,</b> <b>circulating</b> hormones and metabolites. These data support the settling point theory as body weight and metabolic parameters ‘settle’ based on current energetic input and output and do not support the set point theory. Next to that it underlines the importance of diet choice in intervention studies focusing on aspects on the crossroads of nutrition and physiology.   In chapter 3 adipose tissue physiology and molecular regulation was further investigated by exposure to more metabolic stress in the form of a weight loss challenge with different purified diets. Diet-induced obese C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed a high fat diet restricted to 70 % intake of previous ad libitum high fat diet intake or they were changed to ad libitum low fat diet for 5 weeks. Beneficial effects were seen in both interventions regarding physiological parameters. However, molecular parameters in white adipose tissue differed between the two restriction interventions, with increased activation of mitochondrial carbohydrate and fat metabolism in high fat diet restricted mice. When extrapolated to the human situation this may suggest that a reduction of portion size is the best method for weight loss.   It is standard practice to house mice at ambient temperature during physiological intervention studies. Unfortunately mice are then exposed to a temperature below their thermal neutral zone. This implies that their metabolism is chronically increased which is known to influence study outcomes. In chapter 4 the second question; “how is the diet-induced metabolic response affected by housing at thermoneutrality?”was investigated. A 14 -week dietary intervention with two semi-purified diets, a low fat diet and a moderately high fat diet, was performed at 28 °C in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. This resulted in a large diet-induced difference in bodyweight, adipose tissue mass, adipocyte size, and serum leptin level. But no differential effects of the diets were seen on serum glucose, free fatty acids, triacylglycerides, insulin, a panel of cardiovascular markers, and a number of (metabolic) parameters in liver and muscle. Although adipose tissue mass and adipocyte size was increased significantly, there was no sign of inflammation or dysfunction in the adipose tissue. This study suggests that diet-induced obesity of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice at thermoneutrality results in a suitable model for the metabolically ‘healthy’ obese (people who are significantly overweight but show none of the usual metabolic problems). Next to that, this study emphasizes the importance of consideration and control of housing temperature for mice, as it has profound effects on study outcomes. The third and last question investigated was if oxygen restriction is able to induce inflammation in white adipose tissue. There is substantial evidence that white adipose tissue becomes hypoxic when excessively enlarged. Due to fast expansion of white adipose tissue the vasculature is not able to keep pace with growth. Next to that, adipocytes are able to increase in size beyond the limit of oxygen diffusion. To investigate if hypoxia was able to induce inflammation in white adipose tissue, the model for healthy obese adipocytes (developed in chapter 4) was used and exposed to ambient oxygen restriction (13 %) to challenge adipose tissue metabolism. This resulted in the presence of systemic oxygen restriction as shown by increased levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit. Furthermore a switch to glycolytic metabolism, which is indicative for tissue hypoxia, was present. No differences in adipose tissue macrophage infiltration (as marker for inflammation) were found. But, serum branched chain amino acids and adipokines were affected. Branched chain amino acids were increased in mice exposed to oxygen restriction which shows resemblance with findings in humans where increased levels were found in lean versus obese people. The peptide hormone adiponectin was increased in serum, without differences in WAT expression. On the other hand, the peptide hormones CCDC 3 and CCK showed decreased transcript levels in white adipose tissue without significant change in serum levels, although for CCDC 3 a trend was seen. Together these results suggest that oxygen restriction does not induce inflammation in adipose tissue. However, it does affect adipokine regulation. After performing these studies it was clear that composition of the diet has a major influence on outcome parameters of physiological studies as shown in chapter 2. To compare functional effects of different nutrients, it is important to use standardized purified diets. Not only the experimental intervention diet is of importance but also the reference control diet can influence outcomes. For example, when an intervention is performed with a high fat purified diet and the reference diet is chow this will lead to a difficult comparison. The content of chow is variable as it is grain or cereal based (ground corn, ground oats alfalfa meal, soybean meal and ground wheat). Nutritional adequacy is ensured by addition of vitamins, minerals, and fat. However, the exact amount of the various ingredients is frequently kept secret by the manufacturer. Next to that, due to the plant based origin of chow it will contain nutritive (protein, carbohydrate, fat) components but also non-nutritive components (phytochemicals). The content of the chow diet will vary from batch to batch as the nutritive and nonnutritive value will change between harvests. When using a chow reference diet in comparison to a purified diet you will never know exactly what you are comparing, i. e. difference in amino acids or effects of phytochemicals etc. Therefore, a reference diet for physiology was designed (chapter 6) to improve comparison of study outcomes and to increase efficiency of resources and material. A key feature of the diet is the fixed protein concentration, which allows for an exchange of carbohydrate and fat in a high fat version of the diet. To conclude, the work presented in this thesis provides clear insight in factors that are of importance for improvement of translatability of mouse studies to the human situation. It was shown that when investigating the weight balance many parameters, i. e. genetics, metabolic rate, environmental factors like ambient housing temperature and light and cognitive behavior, besides the diet and its composition are able to influence the outcome parameters. As most mouse experiments are performed in a fixed environment with no choices of food and a standard temperature set to 22 °C. This is clearly not reflective of humans under free living conditions. However, these fixed conditions are able to result in experiments that unravel underlying mechanisms of weight balance, which form the basis for discovering a solution to the obesity epidemic...|$|R
