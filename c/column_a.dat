This is usually achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, with the standard process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex50 or TEVA eluted with a solution of ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the <b>column.</b> <b>A</b> rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described.|$|E

In April 1961 he made his second appearance on Desert Island Discs, this time unaccompanied by Murdoch. In October that year—three weeks after the fifth series of Beyond Our Ken began recording—Horne appeared as the anchorman on a new BBC television series, Let's Imagine, a discussion programme which ran for 20 editions over 18 months. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in February 1962, hosted by Eamonn Andrews, in which guests included friends and colleagues from his connections in business and entertainment. In June 1963 he began Ken's <b>Column,</b> <b>a</b> series of 15-minute one-man programmes for Anglia Television.|$|E

25|$|DCC's role in commissural axon {{outgrowth}} {{is perhaps}} its best characterized. In the developing spinal cord, commissural neurons located dorsally extend axons ventrally using a mechanism {{dependent on a}} ventral midline structure, the floor plate. A gradient of netrin-1 is produced from the floor plate, which allows orientation of the extending axons, aiding {{the development of the}} dorsal-ventral axis of the brain and spinal <b>column.</b> <b>A</b> variety of receptors are present on the axon surface which either repel or attract axons to the midline. When membrane DCC is stimulated by netrin-1, it promotes axon progression towards the midline.|$|E

The act also incorporated regular payment for Territorial Force soldiers and training, which included an annual two-week training camp. As a result, when the Territorial Force was formed it was decided there would be fourteen mounted brigades.
