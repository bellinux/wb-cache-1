40|$|As {{in other}} cities of Sri Lanka, solid waste {{management}} has been a key problem in and concern for Balangoda Urban Council. Waste accumulations in the city have caused many problems, including unpleasant odours, contamination of water bodies, and contamination of paddy fields, giving rise to epidemic diseases such as Salmonella, typhoid fever, and diarrhoea. A Balangoda <b>compost</b> <b>plant</b> {{has been set up}} to process municipal solid waste into compost. The project started in 1999 as a city service to provide a solution to the solid waste problem, but converted into a business in later years. Integrated waste management in Balangoda now consists of a Municipal Solid Waste <b>compost</b> <b>plant,</b> septage treatment plant, plastic pelletiser and an open dump. In addition, as there is increasing awareness of environmental and health risks related to the use of agro-chemical fertilisers, demand for alternative – organic – fertilisers is increasing. As per the majority of the <b>compost</b> <b>plants</b> in the country, the Balangoda plants are located in semi-urban or rural areas, facilitating reuse of waste in agriculture, with farming areas located near the <b>compost</b> <b>plants.</b> The Balangoda system thus operationalises rural-urban linkages through the collection of urban food and organic waste and its recycling, sale, and reuse as compost for rural (and peri-urban) producers...|$|R

50|$|Recently, the City of Gatineau {{administration}} {{had plans to}} reuse a former landfill site on Cook Road in {{the north end of}} the sector to build a new <b>composting</b> <b>plant.</b> A deal was planned with a non-profit organisation called La Ressourcerie to operate the site. However, local residents are strongly opposed with health and environmental concerns especially due to the past of the landfill site. Despite displaying their fierce opposition, which included acts of intimidation and threats towards some councillors, at a Gatineau City Council Meeting, Mayor Marc Bureau mentioned that he will still build the plant at the Cook site, and that according to him it was the best possible site.

40|$|The {{hygienic}} {{performance of}} biowaste <b>composting</b> <b>plants</b> {{to ensure the}} quality of compost is of high importance. Existing compost quality assurance systems reflect this importance through intensive testing of hygienic parameters. In many countries are compost quality assurance systems under construction and it is needed to check and to optimize the methods to state the hygienic performance of <b>composting</b> <b>plants.</b> A set of indicator methods to evaluate the hygienic performance of normal operating biowaste <b>composting</b> <b>plants</b> was developed. The indicator methods were developed by investigating temperature measurements from indirect process tests from 23 <b>composting</b> <b>plants</b> belonging to 11 design types of the Hygiene Design Type Testing System of the German Compost Quality Association (BGK e. V.). The presented indicator methods are the grade of hygienisation, the basic curve shape and the hygienic risk area. The temperature courses of single plants are not normal distributed but they were grouped by cluster analysis in normal distributed subgroups. That was a precondition to develop the mentioned indicator methods. For each plant the grade of hygienisation was calculated through transformation into the standard normal distribution. It shows the part in percent of the entire data set which meet the legal temperature requirements.

50|$|The {{process begins}} with the deposit of trash into intake hatches, called portholes, which may be {{specialized}} for waste, recycling, or compost. Portholes are located in public areas and on private property where the owner has opted in. The waste is then pulled through an underground pipeline by air pressure difference created by large industrial fans, in response to porthole sensors that indicate when the trash needs to be emptied and help ensure that only one kind of waste material is travelling through the pipe at a time. The pipelines converge on a central processing facility that uses automated software to direct the waste to the proper container, from there to be trucked to its final location, such as a landfill or <b>composting</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E

The microbial diversity of bioaerosols collected at five open industrial <b>composting</b> <b>plants</b> treating different types of waste was characterized by a culture-independent approach. Core species of the composting bioaerosols were identified. Among them, three phylotypes were quantified by qPCR in air collected outdoor in natural environments and on ten <b>composting</b> <b>plants</b> together with 4 other microbial markers: cultivable bacteria and fungi, total bacteria (epifluorescence microscopy) and viable bacteria (solid-phase cytometry). A combination of three microbial indicators relevant to monitor composting bioaerosols was defined: one general indicator of bioaerosol emission, the viable bacteria, and two bacterial phylotypes specific to composting bioaerosol, NA 07, affiliated to Saccharopolyspora sp. and NC 38, affiliated to the Thermoactinomycetaceae.

30|$|To {{perform an}} {{economic}} analysis, cost–benefit analysis (CBA) methodologies {{are often used}} (Finnveden et al. 2007). A large {{number of studies have}} been conducted on waste-related economic assessments, which often compare different technology options (Aye and Widjaya 2006; Menikpura et al. 2012; Ngoc and Schnitzer 2009; Reich 2005). However, multinational comparative study focusing on a single waste management method practiced in different capacities, particularly for the composting method, is rare. To address this knowledge gap, this study focuses on composting in various capacities from operative <b>composting</b> <b>plants</b> in Asia. The selected <b>composting</b> <b>plants</b> are located in five cities of three countries: Surabaya, Bali and Bekasi in Indonesia, Beijing in China, and Matale in Sri Lanka.|$|R

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{describes the}} handling of biodegradable park and garden waste in the municipality of Lund in Sweden, from these three different perspectives: impact on environment, energy consumption and costs. Today‘s methods, {{as well as some}} other different possibilities in recycling of park and garden waste are investigated. A limitation in the analysis is that all the park and garden waste handled in the municipality is either composted or returned directly to the area after shredding. Composting may be carried out either regionally at SYSAV's "mattress" <b>compost</b> <b>plant</b> (see fig. 2) at Spillepeng in Malmö, or locally on a smaller scale in the municipality of Lund. These limitations allow the impact on the environment to be equal to the fuel consumption for transports and treatment of park and garden waste. More than 7000 tonnes of park and garden waste are produced in the municipality of Lund every year. Almost half of this comes from the household‘s garden waste. The remainder originates from different housing companies, church-yard management, parks etc. Almost half of the park and garden waste from the municipality of Lund is transported to the regional "mattress" compost at Spillepeng. The rest is treated at local windrow <b>composting</b> <b>plants,</b> by home <b>composting</b> or by composting in different areas e. g. in residential areas and in allotments, and by bringing it back, after shredding, to where it originated. Transporting park and garden waste is both energy consuming and expensive, since the material is voluminous. By shredding the park and garden waste it is possible to increase volume weight by four to six times. With the higher volume weight the efficiency of the transports will increase as well. While the distance of transport exceeds 25 km, {{the handling of}} park and garden waste will not be as costly and energy consuming if it is shredded before the transport to a mattress <b>compost</b> <b>plant,</b> as when it is transported unshredded. The cost and energy consumption for the shredding are covered by the higher efficiency in transport, at this distance. Most of the larger <b>composting</b> <b>plants</b> for park and garden waste in Sweden are big central windrow composts. There are small differences in costs and energy consumption between different sizes of windrow composts. This means that long transports of park and garden waste to large central windrow <b>compost</b> <b>plants,</b> compared to short transports to small windrow <b>compost</b> <b>plants,</b> is not a way to save costs and energy. Composting at "mattress" <b>compost</b> <b>plants</b> is not as costly and energy consuming as composting in windrow <b>compost</b> <b>plants.</b> On the other hand, to make a "mattress" <b>compost</b> <b>plant</b> profitable, there must be more than 5000 tonnes of park and garden waste composted every year. If the park and garden waste is shredded at a recycling station it may also be possible to compost it in windrows at the station. Costs and energy consumption for composting park and garden waste are higher at local windrow composts than at regional "mattress" composts. The costly and energy consuming transports of park and garden waste, on the other hand, makes the handling less energy consuming and costly if the park and garden waste is composted locally at a windrow compost, compared to transporting it to a regional mattress compost, if the transport distance exceeds 5 - 6 km. If` all park and garden waste from the municipality of Lund is transported to the regional "mattress" <b>compost</b> <b>plant</b> at Spillepeng, the cost and fuel consumption are calculated to be approx. SEK 5. l millions and approx. 125 m 3 diesel/year respectively. If all the park and garden waste is handled within the municipality by home composting of garden waste and by shredding all the park waste before transport to a local windrow compost, the cost is calculated to decrease to less than SEK 3 millions and the fuel consumption is calculated to decrease to about 20 m 3 diesel/year. Composting is not an end in itself, but it is a way to recycle park and garden waste from green urban areas. By bringing the biodegradable organic material back directly after shredding it, it is also possible to recycle park and garden waste. Another way of recycling is burning ligneous material and digesting biodegradable material with a high amount of nitrogen, followed by spreading of ash and digestion rests. To evaluate the impact on the environment and costs for these alternatives further research is needed. To clarify differences in emissions and the impact on the environment of different processes of decomposition of park and garden waste such as "matress" composting, windrow composting, home composting, natural decomposition, digesting and burning, thorough measurements of emissions from these processes are needed...|$|R
