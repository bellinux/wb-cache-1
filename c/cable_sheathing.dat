40|$|ABSTRACT: Cone {{calorimeter}} {{tests were}} conducted on eight different elec-tric cable samples at four different external heat flux levels between 20 and 50 kW/m 2. Four of the <b>cable</b> samples were <b>sheathed</b> with PVC-based materi-als and four with polyolefin-based materials. Some of the cone calorimeter test results were {{compared with those of}} the horizontally ventilated laboratory-scale gallery fire test and the oxygen index test which had been previously conducted on these samples. From the ignitability data in the cone calorimeter test, these cable samples were considered to be thermally thick materials. The ignition times of the <b>cables</b> <b>sheathed</b> with a PVC-based mate-rial were shorter than those of the <b>cables</b> <b>sheathed</b> with a halogen-free poly-olefin. In addition, the heat and smoke release properties of the cable samples also depended mostly on the type of the main base polymer of the sheath ma-terial. The correlations between the flame propagation property in the duct fire test and the peak heat release rate in the cone calorimeter test were un-clear. On the other hand, there appeared to be relatively good correlations be-tween the minimum O 2 and maximum CO 2 concentrations in the exhaust gas in the duct fire test and the peak heat release rate in the cone calorimeter test. Moreover, a considerably good nonlinear correlation between the limiting oxygen index and the peak heat release rate in the cone calorimeter test o...|$|R

30|$|The {{propagation}} of intracellular calcium {{is vital to}} signal transduction, synaptic transmission, and the dynamics of action potentials [21]. Calcium-induced calcium release brought about via ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) promotes such calcium propagation [22]. Breit and Queisser (2018) specifically study how dendritic geometry and the ER interact to influence calcium wave dynamics [7], modeling the ER within the dendrite as a <b>cable</b> <b>sheathed</b> by another <b>cable</b> layer. Interestingly, they find that a minimal RyR density, which scales inversely with ER surface area, is needed to ensure conditions for traveling wave propagation. Along these lines, as the RyR density increases, so does the speed of calcium waves. In future studies, the authors plan to explore systems with heterogeneous RyR distributions and propose that wave propagation failure could be analyzed using averaging and homogenization [23]. Alternatively, the authors propose to study the asymptotic limit of thin dendrites, so the model could be treated as one-dimensional.|$|R

The development of the open corona point distribution system with the reintroduction of tie wires eliminated problems with gradient control and point lifetime. Easy inspection of the open points is a valuable diagnostic aid when beam transport problems occur. Electromechanical remote actuators for functions in the terminal have been replaced with pneumatic ones driven by SF 6 at 50 psi above tank pressure. Foils are changed, sublimer pellet heaters switched and a high energy tube entrance aperture selected by these devices. Long experience running from 6 to 13 MV has convinced us that enclosed corona points would not make our operation any more convenient. The machine is quite stable with negligible tube and column corona currents. Because of this, the machine typically runs with only one chain at a time. Since installation of SF 6 powered oilers for the chains, there have been no further problems of instability or breakage.

40|$|Wire {{and cable}} {{coverings}} are potentially {{a major cause}} of fire in buildings and other installations. As they need to breach fire walls and are frequently located in vertical ducting, they have significant potential to increase the fire hazard. It is therefore important to understand the ignition and burning characteristics of cables by developing a model capable of predicting their burning behaviour for a range of scenarios. The fire performance of electrical cables is usually dominated by the fire performance of the sheathing materials. The complexity of the problem increases when <b>cable</b> <b>sheathing</b> incorporates fire retardants. One-dimensional pyrolysis models have been constructed for <b>cable</b> <b>sheathing</b> materials, based on milligram-scale and bench-scale test data by comparing the performance of three different software tools (ThermaKin, Comsol Multiphysics and FDS, version 6. 0. 1). Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were conducted on powdered cable coatings to determine the thermal degradation mechanism, the enthalpy of decomposition reactions, and the heat capacities of all apparent species. The emissivity and the in-depth absorption coefficient were determined using reflectance and transmittance measurements, with dispersive and non-dispersive spectrometers and integrating spheres. Bench-scale tests were conducted with a mass loss calorimeter flushed with nitrogen on samples in a horizontal orientation, for comparison with the pyrolysis model of non-flaming decomposition at an external heat flux of 50 kW m- 2. The parameters determined through analysis of the milligram-scale data were used to construct a pyrolysis model that predicted the total mass loss from calorimeter tests in anaerobic conditions. A condensed phase pyrolysis model that accurately predicts in-depth temperature profiles of a solid fuel, and the mass flux of volatiles evolved during degradation of the fuel, is an essential component of a comprehensive fire model, which when coupled to a computational fluid dynamics code can be used to predict the burning processes in a fire scenario. Pyrolysis models vary considerably in complexity based on the assumptions incorporated into the development of the model...|$|E

30|$|Lead (Pb) is a {{naturally}} occurring poisonous metal {{found in the}} Earth’s crust. Because of its softness, high malleability, ductility, low melting point and resistance to corrosion, it is widely used {{in the production of}} lead acid batteries, alloys, solder, pigments, <b>cable</b> <b>sheathing,</b> rust inhibitors, glazes, ammunition, and plastic stabilizers (Deng et al. 2007). However, its widespread application has led to extensive environmental contamination, human exposure and remarkable public health problems. When lead is accidentally inhaled or ingested into the body, it causes serious diseases and permanent damages to human health (ATSDR 2013). Infants and children are very sensitive to the poisonous effects of lead and can suffer far-reaching and permanent unfavorable health effects, particularly influencing the development of the brain and nervous system. Lead also leads to long-term jeopardy in adults like hypertension, dental damage and impaired renal function. Pregnant women exposed to high levels of lead can cause abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery and congenital malformation (Sedighi et al. 2012). No safe blood level has been determined and all sources of lead exposure to children should be eliminated and avoided. Lead concentrations in drinking water should be at least below the current United States Environmental Protection Agency’s threshold level of 0.05  mg/L (US EPA 2011). Therefore, removal of lead from wastewater is very important to protect public health. Chemical precipitation, ion exchange, solvent extraction, phytoextraction, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis and electrodialysis are regarded as the traditional methods for elimination of lead ions from aqueous solutions.|$|E
