25|$|The {{history of}} E. annectens predates both Edmontosaurus and annectens. The first good specimen, the former holotype (specimen {{on which a}} taxonomic name is based) of Anatosaurus copei (Anatotitan), was a {{complete}} skull and most of a skeleton collected in 1882 by Dr. J. L. Wortman and R. S. Hill for American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. This specimen, found in Hell Creek Formation rocks, came from northeast of the Black Hills of South Dakota and originally had extensive skin impressions. It was missing most of the pelvis {{and part of the}} torso due to a stream cutting through it. The bill had impressions of a horny sheath with a tooth-like series of interlocking points on the upper and lower jaws. When describing this specimen AMNH5730, Cope assigned it to the species Diclonius mirabilis. This species name was created by combining Diclonius, a hadrosaurid genus Cope had named earlier from teeth, with Trachodon mirabilis, an older name based on teeth and published by Joseph Leidy. Cope believed that Leidy had failed to properly characterize the genus Trachodon and later abandoned its use, so he assigned the old species to his newer genus. Leidy had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> that his Trachodon was based on the remains of multiple kinds of dinosaurs, and though he had made some attempts to revise the genus, he had not yet made any formal declaration of his intentions.|$|E
500|$|The European, American, and Japanese comics traditions have {{followed}} different paths. [...] Europeans {{have seen their}} tradition as beginning with the Swiss Rodolphe Töpffer from as early as 1827 and Americans have seen the origin of theirs in RichardF. Outcault's 1890s newspaper strip The Yellow Kid, though many Americans have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> Töpffer's precedence. [...] Japan had a long prehistory of satirical cartoons and comics {{leading up to the}} World WarII era. [...] The ukiyo-e artist Hokusai popularized the Japanese term for comics and cartooning, , in the early 19th century. [...] In the post-war era modern Japanese comics began to flourish when Osamu Tezuka produced a prolific body of work.

500|$|Rosenblatt {{contacted}} Ed Steinberg, {{who ran the}} Rock America video {{company and}} asked him if he could spare a few hours to make a music video for [...] "Everybody" [...] with Madonna on stage at her next performance in Danceteria. The idea was to play the video as promotion across the United States so that people will <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> an image of Madonna and her performance. Rosenblatt offered Steinberg $1,000 for the in-house production video, when artists like Duran Duran and Michael Jackson were spending six figure sums on videos. They finally agreed on $1,500. With the low-budget, the video was directed by Steinberg. Steinberg suggested shooting the video on location at the Paradise Garage, a downtown gay disco, instead of filming a live performance. Madonna's friend Debi Mazar did the makeup and joined her other backup dancers, namely Erika Belle and Bags Rilez. Mazar brought a few of her friends to act as a disco crowd in the video, including African-American graffiti artist Michael Stewart. Steinberg was impressed by Madonna's professionalism on the set and he helped to send copies of the tape to nightclubs across America which used dance music videos for their entertainment. This promotion helped the song to grow from being a dance hit in New York to a nationwide hit.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{influential}} {{analysis of}} the role of landed estates in Austen's fiction, Duckworth argues that [...] "estates function not only as the settings of action but as indexes to the character and social responsibility of their owners". Landscape improvements appear as an issue in all of the novels, but in Mansfield Park they become a recurring motif, reflecting the social change {{at the center of the}} novel.

Duckworth writes that [...] "when Elizabeth comes to exclaim to herself that 'to be mistress of Pemberley might be something' she has, we might conjecture, <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> not merely the money and status of Pemberley, but its value as the setting of a traditional social and ethical orientation, its possibilities... as a context for her responsible social activity." ...|$|E

2500|$|The aim of {{psychoanalysis}} is {{to lead the}} analysand to recognize his/her desire and by doing so to uncover the truth about his/her desire.

[...] And again in The Ego in Freud's Theory and in the Technique of Psychoanalysis: [...] "...what is important is to teach the subject to name, to articulate, to bring desire into existence. The subject should <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> and to name his/his desire. But it isn't a question of recognizing something that could be entirely given.

[...] The truth about desire is somehow present in discourse, although discourse is never able to articulate the entire truth about desire, whenever discourse attempts to articulate desire, there is always a leftover or surplus.|$|E
2500|$|Franz Boas {{traveled}} {{north to}} gather ethnographic {{material for the}} Exposition. Boas had intended public science in creating exhibitions for the Exposition where visitors to the Midway could learn about other cultures. Boas arranged for fourteen Kwakiutl aboriginals from British Columbia to come and reside in a mock Kwakiutl village, where they could perform their daily tasks in context. Inuit were there with 12' long whips made of sealskin, wearing sealskin clothing and showing how adept they were in sealskin kayaks. His experience with the Exposition provided {{the first of a}} series of shocks to Franz Boas' faith in public anthropology. The visitors were not there to be educated.

[...] In July 1905 28 men met at the Erie Beach Hotel in Fort Erie, Ontario, opposite Buffalo. Differing explanations exist for why the group met in southern Ontario and not Buffalo. A commonly given reason, which has not been substantiated by primary sources, is that they had originally planned to meet in Buffalo, but were refused accommodation. [...] Du Bois' writings of the time, however, show that his original plan was to find a quiet, out of the way location for the event, and that the Erie Beach Hotel satisfied his requirements. [...] Researcher Cynthia Van Ness has further located contemporary evidence of Buffalo hotels complying with a statewide anti-discrimination law passed in 1895. [...] Bookerites had been alerted to the planned conference, but one who traveled to Buffalo to investigate the conference found no activity there.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the crisis}} concluded, the Hulk {{contacted}} Doctor Doom for help separating him and Banner for good {{in return for}} an unspecified favour. Doom proceeded to perform brain surgery on the Hulk, extracting the uniquely Banner elements from the Hulk's brain and cloning a new body for Banner. When Doctor Doom demands to keep Banner for his own purposes, the Hulk reneges on the deal and flees with Banner's body, leaving his alter ego in the desert where he was created to ensure that Doctor Doom cannot use Banner's intellect. When Banner goes insane due to his separation from the Hulk, irradiating an entire tropical island trying to recreate his transformation- something he cannot do as the cloned body lacks the genetic elements of Banner {{that allowed him to}} process the gamma radiation- the Hulk is forced to destroy his other side by letting him be disintegrated by a gamma bomb, prompting the Hulk to accuse Doom of tampering with Banner's mind, only for Doom to observe that what was witnessed was simply Banner without the Hulk to use as a scapegoat for his problems. Initially assuming that Banner is dead, the Hulk soon realizes that Banner was somehow [...] "re-combined" [...] with him when the gamma bomb disintegrated Banner's body, resulting in the Hulk finding himself waking up in various strange locations, including helping the Punisher confront a drug cartel run by a mutated dog, hunting sasquatches with Kraven the Hunter, and being forced to face Wolverine and the Thing in an old SHIELD base. Banner eventually leaves a video message for the Hulk in which he apologizes for his actions while they were separate, having <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> that he is a better person with the Hulk than without, the two joining forces to thwart the Doombots' attempt to use the animals on Banner's irradiated island as the basis for a new gamma army using a one-of-a-kind gamma cure Banner had created to turn all the animals back to normal. Following this, Bruce willingly joined the spy organization S.H.I.E.L.D., allowing them to use the Hulk as a weapon in exchange for providing him with the means and funding to create a lasting legacy for himself.|$|E
