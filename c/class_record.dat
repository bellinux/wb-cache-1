5|$|An all-rounder with a {{moderate}} first <b>class</b> <b>record</b> (averaging 32 with the bat and 40 with the ball), Cowdrey's debut as {{captain in the}} Fourth Test at Headingley was a disaster. He scored 0 and 5 and took no wickets, as England were crushed by 10 wickets, West Indies again winning at a canter. Worse for Cowdrey, he suffered a minor injury in a county match and was persuaded to step aside for the Fifth Test. He never played for England again.|$|E
5|$|In LMP2, the No. 26 G-Drive Oreca car of Rast and Roman Rusinov {{took the}} fastest time at {{two minutes and}} 7.363 seconds, which was set {{towards the end of}} {{qualifying}} and was a new <b>class</b> <b>record</b> at the track. The two were half a second quicker than the second-place class qualifier, the No. 36 Singatech Alpine entry. Merhi held the category lead early in the session with a lap of two minutes and 7,920 seconds but his co-driver Matt Rao was unable to match the Spaniard's time and ended as the third fastest qualifier, ahead of G-Drive's No. 38 entry in fourth. Sam Bird and Rigon, competing in the No. 71 AF Corse entry, were the fastest LMGTE Pro qualifiers with a two-lap average lap time of two minutes and 17.644 seconds. Bruni, in the second AF Corse vehicle, improved late in the qualifying session which meant Aston Martin's No. 97 car fell to third, and the two Ford Chip Ganassi Team entries rounded out the top five class qualifiers. The No. 98 Aston Martin of Paul Dalla Lana and Lamy took the pole position in LMGTE AM, 1.8 seconds ahead of second-place qualifier, AF Corse's No. 81 car.|$|E

25|$|Osterman earned honors for a {{final time}} from the NFCA, Big 12 and USA softball. Again Osterman also {{collected}} her second Honda Award. She broke and set her final set of Longhorn records in wins, strikeouts, shutouts and strikeout ratio (all-time NCAA Senior <b>Class</b> <b>record),</b> all were career highs. Osterman {{became one of the}} first pitchers to have three 500 strikeout seasons to her credit. For a fourth time in her career, Osterman led the NCAA in ERA and strikeout ratio, setting a new all-time season record in the latter category at 15.4. These would help her to a Big 12 pitching Triple Crown for the best in wins, ERA and strikeouts for that year.|$|E
25|$|Osterman pitched 5 no-hitters (NCAA top-5 season record) {{and opened}} the season with six {{consecutive}} shutouts, including an opening day no-hitter and a 16–0 romp over the Oklahoma Christian Lady Eagles. On February 11 she won her 100th career game, 3–0, against the Northwestern Wildcats in shutout fashion. On February 16, she struck out 13 Oklahoma Christian Lady Eagles batters to bring her career total to 1,708, making her just the second pitcher in NCAA history to reach the 1,700 plateau. Later she also struck out 20 batters in a 7-inning, 5–1 win over the UTSA Roadrunners on February 21 (the Senior <b>Class</b> <b>record</b> for a regulation game), which is tied second most in NCAA history and her career best at Texas for a regulation game.|$|E
25|$|Osterman {{received}} her second First Team All-American citation and repeated honors from the Big 12 and USA Softball. She also added the Honda Sports Award for softball that year as well. Osterman {{was named the}} 2005 Sportswoman of the Year (in the team category) by the Women's Sports Foundation. She also topped her previous UT single-season records for ERA (career best), strikeouts, strikeout ratio (all-time NCAA Junior <b>Class</b> <b>record),</b> shutouts, opponents batting average and complete games. The opponents BA remains the school record and Osterman again led the NCAA in ERA and strikeout ratio in addition; the ratio was another new all-time record. Finally, she set Big 12 records in ERA, strikeouts and opponents batting average, of which only the strikeouts has been surpassed. She finished the season at third place on the all-time NCAA single-season strikeout list.|$|E

25|$|However, Gloucestershire bowled {{with more}} effect {{the second time}} around, Malinga Bandara taking four for 85 in a {{marathon}} 37-over spin bowling effort. Rudge repaired his golden duck, taking a wicket with his first ball of the innings to remove Mark Wallace for another golden duck. However, Rudge was taken for 36 in a six-over spell, and never returned to bowl. Dean Cosker top scored for Glamorgan with 52 from number seven {{as they made their}} way to 290, setting Gloucestershire a target of 540 to win - which would have been a first <b>class</b> <b>record</b> chase. Ramnaresh Sarwan attempted it, hitting out well after Kadeer Ali had been dismissed, but he was eventually bowled by Huw Waters for 54. Gloucestershire succumbed to 184 for 5 at stumps, needing to survive another day for the draw. Wharf spoiled that, though, taking four wickets on the fourth morning as Gloucestershire crawled to 217 and a 322-run defeat.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{striped bass}} ever taken by angling was an 81.88-lb (37.14-kg) {{specimen}} {{taken from a}} boat in Long Island Sound, near the Outer Southwest Reef, {{off the coast of}} Westbrook, Connecticut. The all-tackle world record fish was taken by Gregory Myerson on the night of August 4, 2011. The fish took a drifted live eel bait, and fought for 20 minutes before being boated by Myerson. A second hook and leader was discovered in the fish's mouth when it was boated, indicating it had been previously hooked by another angler. The fish measured 54in length and had a girth of 36in. The International Game Fish Association declared Myerson's catch the new all-tackle world record striped bass on October 19, 2011. In addition to now holding the All-Tackle record, Meyerson's catch also landed him the new IGFA men’s 37-kg (80-lb) line <b>class</b> <b>record</b> for striped bass, which previously stood at 70lb. The previous all-tackle world record fish was a 78.5-lb (35.6-kg) specimen taken in Atlantic City, New Jersey on September 21, 1982 by Albert McReynolds, who fought the fish from the beach for 1:20 after it took his Rebel artificial lure.|$|E
