50|$|Cobalt(II) {{hydroxide}} or {{cobaltous hydroxide}} is the inorganic compound with the formula <b>Co(OH)2.</b> It is a rose-red powder. An unstable blue form, so-called α-Co(OH)2, {{has also been}} reported. It is most used as a drying agent for paints, varnishes, and inks, {{in the preparation of}} other cobalt compounds, as a catalyst and in the manufacture of battery electrodes.|$|E
50|$|Cobalt oxide {{nanoparticles}} {{are being}} investigated in optimizing high performance in lithium-ion batteries. This {{is due to}} their high surface-to-volume ratio and short path length for lithium cation transport, as opposed to nickel oxide and iron oxides. Some proposals include Co3O4 nanoparticles anchored on graphene {{as a source of}} possible lithium battery anodes. This is synthesized by first forming <b>Co(OH)2</b> on the sheet from Co2+ and NH3H2O, which is then heated to 450 °C for two hours to yield the cobalt oxide/graphene composite. The advantageous combination of the graphene sheet’s flexibility and its strong interaction with Co3O4 nanoparticles prevent volume expansion/contraction and aggregation of Co3O4 during lithium charge and discharge processes.|$|E
50|$|Cobalt salts {{can be used}} as WOCs, {{but their}} water {{oxidation}} capability decreases {{with the passage of time}} because of the precipitation of the salt from the homogenous solutions, resulting in turbidity. Kanan and Nocera have demonstrated the formation of a dark thin film over the surface of indium tin oxide which was used an electrode, along with bubbling in the solution. These bubbles were confirmed to be of oxygen. Co-WOCs have been shown to work very efficiently at a pH 7.0. Heterogeneous cobalt oxide(Co3O4) have been investigated to work on the same pattern as other cobalt salts. No mechanism has been reported so far for these WOCs. A homogenous cobalt polyoxametalate complex Co4(H2O)2(α-PW9O34)210− have been described to be highly efficient as compared to the reported heterogeneous cobalt complexes reported by Yin et al. Zidki et al. prepared stable WOCs by adsorbing CoII as <b>Co(OH)2</b> clusters on silica nanoparticles which exhibited a high water oxidation activity.A homogeneous WOC Co(Py5)(H2O)(ClO4)2 was reported by Waylenko and co-workers. The complex undergoes a proton-coupled electron transfer to form a stable CoIII--OH2+ specie which on further oxidation forms a CoIV intermediate. The intermediate formed reacts with water to liberate O2.|$|E
50|$|The ores {{are treated}} by a sulfatizing roast in a {{fluidized}} bed furnace to convert copper and cobalt sulfides into soluble oxides and iron into insoluble hematite. The calcine is subsequently leached with sulfuric acid from the spent copper recovery electrolyte. Oxide concentrates are introduced at this leaching step {{to maintain the}} acid balance in the circuit. Iron and aluminum are removed from the leach solution {{by the addition of}} lime, and copper is electrowon on copper cathodes. A part of the spent electrolyte enters the cobalt recovery circuit and is purified by the removal of iron, copper, nickel, and zinc prior to the precipitation of cobalt as its hydroxide. This is accomplished by the addition of more lime to raise the pH until the remaining copper precipitates. This copper is sent back to the copper circuit. As more lime is then added, a copper-cobaltite precipitates and is fed back to the leaching process. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) is added (along with some metallic cobalt as a catalyst) to precipitate nickel sulfide (NiS). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) are then added to precipitate zinc sulfide (ZnS). Lime is then added to saturation to precipitate cobalt(II) hydroxide (<b>Co(OH)2).</b> In the final stages, this cobalt hydroxide is redissolved and the metal is refined by electrolysis. The resulting cobalt cathodes are crushed and vacuum degassed to obtain a pure cobalt metal.|$|E
