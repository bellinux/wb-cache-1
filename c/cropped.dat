40|$|Weed {{management}} {{is a major}} issue in organic farming systems. Although interseeding cover <b>crops</b> is one alternative to herbicides, cover <b>crops</b> often suppress not only weeds but also main <b>crops.</b> Therefore, using cover <b>crops</b> for weed control without adverse effects on main <b>crop</b> growth is important. To verify the effect of cover <b>crops</b> on competition between main <b>crops,</b> cover <b>crops</b> and weeds in a snowy-cold region, main <b>crops</b> soybean (Glycine max Merr.) in 2005 and maize (Zea mays L.) in 2006 were grown with cover <b>crops</b> winter rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), respectively. The cover <b>crops</b> were sown on three sowing dates: before main <b>crop</b> planting (Pre-MC), on the same date of main <b>crop</b> planting (Syn-MC) and after main <b>crop</b> planting (Post-MC). A plot without cover <b>crops</b> (Sole-MC) was used as a control. The dry weight (DW), vegetation cover ratio (VCR), vertical community structure and chlorophyll content were measured to estimate the competition between main <b>crops,</b> cover <b>crops</b> and weeds. Weed DW was suppressed significantly by sowing cover <b>crops</b> in both soybean and maize. This weed suppression was associated with the increase of VCR of main <b>crops</b> plus cover <b>crops</b> at the early growth stage of main <b>crops.</b> Soil seed banks of dominant weed also became lower by sowing cover <b>crops,</b> implying the importance of proper weed management for suppressing weeds successively. In addition, the sowing dates of cover <b>crops</b> had large effects on main <b>crops</b> DW especially in maize, i. e., it was significantly lower in Pre-MC and Syn-MC than in Post-MC. Although the cover <b>crop</b> height was markedly shorter than the main <b>crop</b> height, the chlorophyll content of the main <b>crops</b> was significantly lower when cover <b>crops</b> were sown earlier. These results suggest that the growth inhibition of main <b>crops</b> by cover <b>crops</b> was partly caused by competition for nutrients between main <b>crops</b> and cover <b>crops,</b> and this growth inhibition was alleviated when cover <b>crops</b> were sown after the establishment of main <b>crops.</b> Consequently, soybean yield was the highest in Post-MC and decreased by 29 %, 18 % and 7 % in Sole-MC, Pre-MC and Syn-MC, respectively, and maize yield was also the highest in Post-MC and decreased by 68 %, 100 % and 24 % in Sole-MC, Pre-MC and Syn-MC, respectively. It was concluded that weeds could be controlled effectively by sowing cover <b>crops</b> after planting main <b>crops</b> in organic farming systems in a snowy-cold region...|$|R

40|$|Interseeding cover <b>crops</b> is an {{alternative}} to laborious intertillages and hand weeding followed in organic farming. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of fertilization and interseeding cover <b>crops</b> on the growth of main <b>crops</b> and weeds and the stability of weed suppression over years and main <b>crop</b> species under four-year rotational organic farming. Two cover <b>crops,</b> winter rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), were interseeded in furrows of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), soybean (Glycine max Merr.) and maize (Zea mays L.) at 3 - 5 weeks after planting the main <b>crops.</b> The number and dry weight of weeds were measured at the maximum plant height stage of main <b>crops</b> and main <b>crop</b> yields were recorded at their physiological maturity. The light competition between main <b>crops,</b> cover <b>crops</b> and weeds was analyzed by vertical community structure and vegetation cover ratio (VCR) of each <b>crop.</b> Since light competition of main <b>crops</b> with cover <b>crops</b> and weeds was not severe, main <b>crop</b> yields were not suppressed significantly by either cover <b>crops</b> or weeds. Weed growth was suppressed significantly by interseeding cover <b>crops</b> through increasing the VCR of main <b>crops</b> plus cover <b>crops.</b> This weed suppression by interseeding cover <b>crops</b> was stable to the main <b>crop</b> species in rotational <b>cropping</b> systems and to the various environmental conditions, because the cover <b>crops</b> compensated the low VCR of main <b>crops</b> alone at early growth stage especially when main <b>crop</b> growth was depressed by unfavorable environmental conditions. In addition, input of compost and fermented organic fertilizer had positive effects on the main <b>crop</b> yield and weed suppression. It is concluded, therefore, that weeds can be suppressed effectively and stably without yield reductions of main <b>crops</b> by interseeding cover <b>crops</b> with sufficient fertilization in organic farming systems...|$|R

40|$|When sown {{correctly}} at {{the right}} time, in the right position within the rotation, cover <b>crops</b> retain nutrients, conserve water, prevent soil erosion, improve soil fertility and quality, and suppress weeds. Growing cover <b>crops</b> is recognized as a climate-smart agricultural practice. Practical recommendation Where to position and when to time cover <b>crops</b> in the rotation? •	Grow cover <b>crops</b> in the 1 st and 2 nd year after ploughing of clover-grass to avoid nitrogen losses. •	Grow nitrogen fixing cover <b>crops</b> on soils with low fertility. •	Sow cover <b>crops</b> into or immediately after the main <b>crop.</b> In row <b>crops,</b> sow the cover <b>crop</b> {{in combination with the}} last hoeing. If the harvest of the main <b>crop</b> is rather early, sow the cover <b>crop</b> after harvest. •	The earlier a cover <b>crop</b> is sown in August, less nitrogen is lost. Each day of delay in sowing a cruciferous cover <b>crop</b> in August results in loss of about 2 kg of N per ha. •	Do not sow cruciferous cover <b>crops</b> into main <b>crops</b> shortly before the harvest, as weed competition may be too high for successful establishment of the cover <b>crop.</b> •	Cover <b>crops</b> sown in spring usually establish well and safely. For spring-sown cover <b>crops</b> use clover mix rather than ryegrass to satisfy nitrogen needs. •	On sandy soils with irrigation, undersow spring <b>crops</b> with wide row distances after the main <b>crop</b> has developed 1 - 2 nodes high to allow hoeing of the main <b>crop</b> in early stages. •	In winter <b>crops,</b> sow cover <b>crops</b> (clover mix rather than ryegrass) in spring as early as possible. •	Use cover <b>crops</b> after application of large amounts of solid manure, as it helps to retain the nitrogen. •	In lupines or broad beans, undersow a cover <b>crop</b> followed by a spring <b>crop</b> the next year. If a winter <b>crop</b> is chosen instead, perennial weeds might flourish. Cover <b>crops</b> and weed control •	Problems with creeping thistle, sow-thistle and coltsfoot do not rule out cover crops: Sow the cover <b>crop</b> immedia¬tely after an early harvest and ploughing. Repeat ploughing in spring before sowing a spring <b>crop.</b> •	To reduce couch-grass, mechanical treatment in autumn is more efficient than growing a cover <b>crop...</b>|$|R

40|$|Moving to more agroecological <b>cropping</b> systems implies deep {{changes in}} the {{organization}} of <b>cropping</b> systems. We propose a method for formalizing the process of innovating <b>cropping</b> system prototype design using a tool called PRACT (Prototyping Rotation and Association with Cover <b>crop</b> and no Till) applied to a Malagasy case study. The input information for PRACT is comprised of: (i) <b>crop</b> and cover <b>crop</b> adaptation to biophysical conditions, (ii) agroecological functions of the cover <b>crops,</b> (iii) <b>crop</b> production, (iv) association possibilities between <b>crop</b> and cover <b>crop,</b> and (v) agroecological functions of the <b>cropping</b> system. All the information was derived from expert knowledge developed over more than 12 years of agronomic experiments in Madagascar. The final output from PRACT is a list of <b>cropping</b> systems, i. e., <b>crop</b> and cover <b>crop</b> associations and their sequences over three years. These <b>cropping</b> systems are characterized by their potential agroecological functions and <b>crop</b> production. The PRACT model selects a list of <b>cropping</b> systems taking into account the above information by using elaborate rules governing the intercropping and sequences between <b>crops</b> and cover <b>crops.</b> Examples of the outcomes of model simulations are provided for four different kinds of field. Taking into account the range of potential <b>crops</b> and cover <b>crops,</b> the number of <b>cropping</b> systems that was theoretically possible for the different field types ranged from 19, 683 to 2. 98 × 1013. In a first step, PRACT reduced this number by a factor of up to 28 times to propose possible <b>cropping</b> systems. To do so, <b>cropping</b> systems are selected in terms of the biophysical requirements of plants, plant compatibility and agronomic rules. Not all of these systems are suitable for every farmer. Thus using PRACT output, a second <b>cropping</b> system selection step can be taken based on these <b>cropping</b> system characteristics, i. e., <b>crop</b> production and agroecological functions. By doing so the number of <b>cropping</b> systems selected can reach a reasonable value that can be handled by technicians and farmers.
