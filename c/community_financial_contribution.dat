40|$|This {{paper has}} {{identified}} {{the opportunity for}} a water supply project in a rural village {{in the heart of the}} Western Highlands in Papua New Guinea. It begins with a brief review of the issue of access to safe, clean and portable water for citizens and the inability of Third World governments to meet water requirements and the changing emphasis of donor agencies, more specifically the World Bank to fund water supply and related services through a demand response approach [DRA]. It then examines the national social and economic development status of the country and focuses on the issue of lack of access to safe portable water as a key problem for rural inhabitants who comprise the majority of the population. Against this background the opportunity for this project is presented with a critical analysis of the community’s capacity to undertake and maintain the water supply facility using previous experience in two similar projects. It also outlines progress of work on this water project to date in relation to the formation of the water supply committee, completion of a feasibility study, design information, required materials and cost estimates, <b>community</b> <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> and the preparedness of the community to be responsible for the entire process. Potential risks to the project have also been identified and risk mitigation strategies are in place to address emerging issues. The value of undertaking this project is rooted in meeting the requirement for access to safe portable water as a basic need and for the long-term improvement in health and well-being of the people which indirectly contributes to economic benefits...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{the effects of}} decentralization on health financing and governance policies in Mexico {{from the perspective of}} users and providers. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in four states that were selected according to geopolitical and administrative criteria. Four indicators were assessed: changes and effects on governance, financing sources and funds, the final destination of resources, and fund allocation mechanisms. Data collection was performed using in-depth interviews with health system key personnel and community leaders, consensus techniques and document analyses. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed by thematic segmentation. RESULTS: The results show different effectiveness levels for the four states regarding changes in financing policies and community participation. Effects on health financing after decentralization were identified in each state, including: greater participation of municipal and state governments in health expenditure, increased financial participation of households, greater community participation in low-income states, duality and confusion in the new mechanisms for coordination among the three government levels, absence of an accountability system, lack of human resources and technical skills to implement, monitor and evaluate changes in financing. CONCLUSIONS: In general, positive and negative effects of decentralization on health financing and governance were identified. The effects mentioned by health service providers and users were related to a diversification of financing sources, a greater margin for decisions around the use and final destination of financial resources and normative development for the use of resources. At the <b>community</b> level, direct <b>financial</b> <b>contributions</b> were mentioned, as well as in-kind contributions, particularly in the form of community work...|$|R

Finally, a brief costing exercise of such a grant is undertaken. The minimum <b>financial</b> <b>contribution</b> simulations are very useful insights into the scale and nature of the poverty challenge in South Africa. The universal income grant numbers testify to the importance of balancing the undoubted need for poverty alleviation as against the pressure on the fiscus. Such interventions are likely to induce.
