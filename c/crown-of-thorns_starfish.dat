5|$|The <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish,</b> {{like other}} starfish such as Metrodira subulata, has {{conspicuous}} coloration and conspicuous long, sharp spines, {{as well as}} chemical defences {{in the form of}} saponins; this evidence is argued to be sufficient for such species to be considered aposematic.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species are}} generalist predators, eating microalgae, sponges, bivalves, snails {{and other small}} animals. The <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish</b> consumes coral polyps, while other species are detritivores, feeding on decomposing organic {{material}} and faecal matter. A few are suspension feeders, gathering in phytoplankton; Henricia and Echinaster often occur in association with sponges, benefiting from the water current they produce. Various species {{have been shown to}} be able to absorb organic nutrients from the surrounding water, and this may form a significant portion of their diet.|$|E
5|$|Starfish may be preyed on by conspecifics, other starfish species, tritons, crabs, fish, gulls and sea otters. Their first {{lines of}} defence are the {{saponins}} present in their body walls, which have unpleasant flavours. Some starfish such as Astropecten polyacanthus also include powerful toxins such as tetrodotoxin among their chemical armoury, and the slime star can ooze out {{large quantities of}} repellent mucus. They also have body armour {{in the form of}} hard plates and spines. The <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish</b> is particularly unattractive to potential predators, being heavily defended by sharp spines, laced with toxins and sometimes with bright warning colours. Other species protect their vulnerable tube feet and arm tips by lining their ambulacral grooves with spines and heavily plating their extremities.|$|E

50|$|In reef {{areas of}} low densities of hard coral, {{reflecting}} {{the nature of}} the reef community or due to feeding by high density <b>crown-of-thorns,</b> the <b>starfish</b> may be found feeding on soft corals (Alcyonacea).|$|R
5|$|Starfish {{sometimes}} have {{negative effects on}} ecosystems. Outbreaks of <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish</b> have caused damage to coral reefs in Northeast Australia and French Polynesia. A study in Polynesia found that coral cover declined drastically {{with the arrival of}} migratory starfish in 2006, dropping from 50% to under 5% in three years. This had an unintended effect on reef-feeding fish and the whole benthic community. Asterias amurensis is one of a few echinoderm invasive species. Its larvae likely arrived in Tasmania from central Japan via water discharged from ships in the 1980s. The species has since grown in numbers {{to the point where they}} threaten commercially important bivalve populations. As such, they are considered pests, and are on the Invasive Species Specialist Group's list of the world's 100 worst invasive species.|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs {{are some}} of the most biodiverse {{habitats}} on earth supporting large numbers of species, not just of corals but also of fish, molluscs, worms, arthropods, starfish, sea urchins, other invertebrates and algae. Because of the photosynthetic requirements of the corals, they are found in shallow waters, and many of these fringe land masses. With a three-dimensional structure, coral reefs are very productive ecosystems; they provide food for their inhabitants, hiding places of various sizes to suit many organisms, perching places, barriers to large predators and solid structures on which to grow. They are used as breeding grounds and as nurseries by many species of pelagic fish, and they influence the productivity of the ocean for miles around. Anthazoans prey on animals smaller than they are and are themselves eaten by such animals as fish, crabs, barnacles, snails and starfish. Their habitats are easily disturbed by outside factors which unbalance the ecosystem. In 1989, the invasive <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish</b> (Acanthaster planci) caused havoc in American Samoa, killing 90% of the corals in the reefs.|$|E
5|$|Starfish are marine invertebrates. They {{typically}} have a central disc and five arms, though some species {{have a larger}} number of arms. The aboral or upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with overlapping plates. Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red or orange, while others are blue, grey or brown. Starfish have tube feet operated by a hydraulic system and a mouth at the centre of the oral or lower surface. They are opportunistic feeders and are mostly predators on benthic invertebrates. Several species have specialized feeding behaviours including eversion of their stomachs and suspension feeding. They have complex life cycles and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most can regenerate damaged parts or lost arms and they can shed arms as a means of defence. The Asteroidea occupy several significant ecological roles. Starfish, such as the ochre sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the reef sea star (Stichaster australis), have become widely known as examples of the keystone species concept in ecology. The tropical <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish</b> (Acanthaster planci) is a voracious predator of coral throughout the Indo-Pacific region, and the northern Pacific sea star is considered {{to be one of the}} world's 100 worst invasive species.|$|E
50|$|The long, sharp spines on {{the sides}} of the starfish's arms and upper (aboral) surface {{resemble}} thorns and create a crown-like shape, giving the creature its name. The spines are stiff and very sharp, and readily pierce through soft surfaces. Despite the battery of sharp spines on the aboral surface and blunt spines on the oral surface, the <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish's</b> general body surface is membranous and soft. When the starfish is removed from the water, the body surface ruptures and the body fluid leaks out, so the body collapses and flattens. The spines bend over and flatten, as well. They recover their shape when reimmersed, if they are still alive.|$|R
5000|$|The Great Barrier Reef {{along the}} coast of Australia {{experienced}} bleaching events in 1980, 1982, 1992, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2016. [...] Some locations suffered severe damage, with up to 90% mortality. The most widespread and intense events occurred in the summers of 1998 and 2002, with 42% and 54% respectively of reefs bleached to some extent, and 18% strongly bleached. However coral losses on the reef between 1995 and 2009 were largely offset by growth of new corals. An overall analysis of coral loss found that coral populations on the Great Barrier Reef had declined by 50.7% from 1985 to 2012, but with only about 10% of that decline attributable to bleaching, and the remaining 90% caused about equally by tropical cyclones and by predation by <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfishes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Increased {{frequency}} of disturbances and anthropogenic activities are predicted {{to have a}} devastating impact on coral reefs that will ultimately change the composition of reef associated fish communities. We reviewed and analysed studies that document the effects of disturbance-mediated coral loss on coral reef fishes. Meta-analysis of 17 independent studies revealed that 62 % of fish species declined in abundance within 3 years of disturbances that resulted in > 10 % decline in coral cover. Abundances of species reliant on live coral for food and shelter consistently declined during this time frame, while abundance of some species that feed on invertebrates, algae and/or detritus increased. The response of species, particularly those expected {{to benefit from the}} immediate loss of coral, is, however, variable and is attributed to erratic replenishment of stocks, ecological versatility of species and sublethal responses, such as changes in growth, body condition and feeding rates. The diversity of fish communities was found to be negatively and linearly correlated to disturbance-mediated coral loss. Coral loss > 20 % typically resulted in a decline in species richness of fish communities, although diversity may initially increase following small declines in coral cover from high coverage. Disturbances that result in an immediate loss of habitat complexity (e. g. severe tropical storms), have a greater impact on fishes from all trophic levels, compared with disturbances that kill corals, but leave the reef framework intact (e. g. coral bleaching and outbreaks of Acanthaster planci). This is most evident among small bodied species and suggests the long-term consequences of coral loss through coral bleaching and <b>crown-of-thorn</b> <b>starfish</b> outbreaks may be much more substantial than the short-term effects currently documented...|$|R
25|$|Houtman Abrolhos has an {{extremely}} high diversity of echinoderms, with 172 species having been recorded there. 63% {{of these are}} tropical species, 14% are temperate, and 22% are endemic to Western Australia. None is endemic to the Houtman Abrolhos. Published surveys have not included observations of the <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish</b> (Ananthaster planci), but individuals have occasionally been observed there. For {{a complete list of}} species, see list of echinoderms of the Houtman Abrolhos.|$|E
25|$|A huge {{variety of}} marine {{invertebrates}} {{are found in}} Australian waters, with the Great Barrier Reef {{an important source of}} this diversity. Families include the Porifera or sea sponges, the Cnidaria (includes the jellyfish, corals and sea anemones, comb jellies), the Echinodermata (includes the sea urchins, sea stars, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, the lamp shells) and the Mollusca (includes snails, slugs, limpets, squid, octopus, cockles, oysters, clams, and chitons). Venomous invertebrates include the box jellyfish, the blue-ringed octopus, and ten species of cone snail, which can cause respiratory failure and death in humans. The <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish</b> usually inhabits the Reef at low densities. However, under conditions that are not yet well understood, they can reproduce to reach an unsustainable population density when coral is devoured at a rate faster than it can regenerate. This presents a serious reef management issue. Other problematic marine invertebrates include the native species purple sea urchin and the white urchin, which have been able to take over marine habitats and form urchin barrens due to the over harvesting of their natural predators which include abalone and rock lobster. Introduced invertebrate pests include the Asian mussel, New Zealand green-lipped mussel, black-striped mussel and the Northern Pacific seastar, all of which displace native shellfish.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish</b> (Acanthaster planci) is {{the major}} {{predator}} of the reefs, as it preys upon coral polyps by climbing onto them, [...] its stomach over them, and releasing digestive enzymes to absorb the liquefied tissue. An individual adult can eat up to 6 m2 of reef per year. In 2000, an outbreak of <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish</b> contributed {{to a loss of}} 66% of live coral cover on sampled reefs. Changes in water quality and overfishing of natural predators, such as the Giant Triton, may have contributed to {{an increase in the number}} of <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since 2010, the Marine National Park Headquarters {{and some}} other {{organizations}} have inspected the coral reefs and removed <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish,</b> which eat coral. No large populations of <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish</b> were found in 2014 and 2015. It is unclear if this {{was caused by the}} removal of the <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish</b> or the life cycle of the starfish.|$|E

The attractant compounds were isolated and identified as arachidonic acid and α-linolenic acid. The authors believe that this discovery may be used to augment population control measures of the <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish,</b> which are highly destructive to coral reefs.|$|E

50|$|Overfishing, {{particularly}} selective overfishing, can unbalance coral ecosystems {{by encouraging}} the excessive growth of coral predators. Predators that eat living coral, {{such as the}} <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish,</b> are called corallivores. Coral reefs are built from stony coral, which evolved with large amounts of the wax cetyl palmitate in their tissues. Most predators find this wax indigestible. The <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish</b> is a large (up to one meter) starfish protected by long, venomous spines. Its enzyme system dissolves the wax in stony corals, and allows the starfish to feed on the living animal. Starfish face predators of their own, such as the giant triton sea snail. However, the giant triton is valued for its shell and has been over fished. As a result, <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish</b> populations can periodically grow unchecked, devastating reefs.|$|E

Paracorynactis hoplites also {{do not seem to be}} affected by the toxins of venomous echinoderms like the aforementioned <b>crown-of-thorns</b> <b>starfish</b> and the flower urchin (Toxopneustes pileolus); both of which are toxic to humans, fish, and other marine predators.|$|E
